In pursuance of this statute the plaintiff, in April 1860, purchased the last-named property and mortgaged the same to the Commonwealth; and, on July 6,1860, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>also made a mortgage to it of \u201c its own entire railroad,\u201d \u201c and all its franchises and property whatever.\u201d On April 5, 1862, a further mortgage was made to the Commonwealth of \u201c all the franchises and property whatsoever, real, personal and mixed, of said Troy and Greenfield Railroad Company.\u201d All of these mortgages were as additional security for the payment of the above-mentioned loans.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b64-4\">On September 4, 1862, under the St. of 1862, <em>c. </em>156, an act authorizing the plaintiff to surrender to the Commonwealth the property mortgaged, and providing for the completion of the road and tunnel by the Commonwealth, and that \u201c the right of redemption \u201d should not be barred until ten years had elapsed after the road and tunnel should be completed and open for use, the plaintiff surrendered to the Commonwealth, under the several mortgages, all its property, real, personal and mixed. This surrender was made, not by reason of any default on the part of the plaintiff, but because the Commonwealth was specially interested in completing the road and tunnel, and requested the surrender to be made. At the time of the surrender, the Commonwealth had only advanced on account of the road and tunnel the sum of $725,338; and, after the surrender, the Commonwealth remained in exclusive possession of the property and managed the same as it saw fit, and completed the road and tunnel, and opened them for use about June 30, 1876.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b64-5\">On December 21,1878, a demand was made on the treasurer of the Commonwealth for an account of the expenditures made in behalf of the road and tunnel, and an offer made to redeem on payment of such sum as was equitably due.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b64-6\">The prayer of the bill was for an account; that the plaintiff should be allowed to redeem on payment of such sum as should be found to be due; and for further relief.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b64-7\">The Commonwealth appeared specially, and demurred to the bill, assigning the following, among other grounds of demurrer: \u201c The defendant is a sovereign state, and cannot be impleaded in said cause, or be bound by any order or decree that may issue from this honorable court therein.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b64-8\">The case was heard by Endicott, J., on the bill and demurrer, and reserved for the determination of the full court.

R 10 Q. B. 31. See <em>Chisholm </em>v. <em>Georgia, </em>2 Dall. 419, 437 <em>&amp; seq. </em>And where a sovereign assumes the character of a trader, the privilege of sovereignty is waived. <em>The Charkieh, </em>L. R. 4 Ad. &amp; Ec. 59. See also <em>Curran </em>v. <em>Arkansas, </em>15 How. 304.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b65-4\">The St. of 1862, <em>c. </em>156, \u00a7 2, under which the plaintiff surren dered its property to the Commonwealth, expressly provides that \u201cthe right of redemption shall not be barred\u201d for a certain time. What remained in the plaintiff after the surrender was therefore clearly recognized as a right, and not as a matter of grace; and the fact that no form of remedy was specifically pointed out is a strong indication that the Legislature intended that the plaintiff should have the remedy already provided in similar cases. Construing the statutes then and now in force in connection with the St. of 1862, <em>c. </em>156, there is no difficulty in finding the remedy.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b65-5\">As early as 1804, the right was given to any mortgagor, who had mortgaged \u201c any real estate \u201d to the Commonwealth, to file a bill in equity in this court to redeem the same. St. 1804, <em>c. </em>103. In the subsequent reenactments of this statute, the words \u201c real estate \u201d are omitted. Rev. Sts. <em>c. </em>107, \u00a7\u00a7 35-39. Gen. Sts. <em>c. </em>140, \u00a7\u00a7 45-48. In 1804 railroad mortgages were unknown, but in 1860 they were very common, and it may well be that the change in phraseology was intentionally made broad enough to include them. However this may be, the greater part of the property in question is real estate, and so comes within the most restricted construction of the act. And the Gen. Sts. <em>e. </em>63, \u00a7 128, specifically give this court jurisdiction in equity \u201c of all questions arising out of railroad mortgages.\u201d This language is broad enough to include mortgages to the Commonwealth, and that such was the intention of the Legislature is shown by the three following sections, which provide for the form of a railroad mortgage to the Commonwealth, what property it shall include, and where it shall be recorded.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b66-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>Gray, C. J.</author>\n<p id=\"AY4\">It is a fundamental principle of ouT jurispra? dence, that the Commonwealth cannot be impleaded in its own courts, except by its own consent clearly manifested by act of the Legislature; and this principle is applicable to actions to recover real estate, and to bills in equity to enforce trusts, or to foreclose or redeem mortgages. The distinction suggested in the ease of <em>The </em>Charkieh, L. R. 4 Ad. &amp; Ec. 59, cited in the able and learned argument for the plaintiff, as to a foreign sovereign assuming the character of a trader, cannot be entertained by the courts of the government against which the suit is brought. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Clarke, 8 </em>Pet. 436. <em>Curran </em>v. <em>Arkansas, </em>15 How. 304, 309. <em>The Davis, </em>10 Wall. 15. <em>Carr </em>v. <em>United States, </em>98 U. S. 433. <em>Sewall </em>v. <em>Lee, </em>9 Mass. 363, 370. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Andre\u2019s Heirs, </em>3 Pick. 224, 225. <em>Pingree </em>v. <em>Coffin, </em>12 Gray, 288, 321. <em>Briggs </em>v. <em>Light Boats, </em>11 Allen, 157, 170-176, and cases there cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-4\">The object of the present bill is to redeem the entire railroad, franchise and property of the Troy and Greenfield Railroad Company, mortgaged by that corporation to the Commonwealth, under the Sts. of 1854, <em>c. </em>226, and 1860, <em>c. </em>202, and surrendered to the Commonwealth under the St. of 1862, <em>a. </em>156, which provides that \u201c the right of redemption shall not be barred until ten years have elapsed after said road and tunnel are completed and the same open for use.\u201d Neither of these statutes contains any provision as to the manner of asserting this right of redemption.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-5\">The only provisions of statute, that can be supposed to have any application to the case, are contained in those chapters of the General Statutes which relate to the equity jurisdiction of this court, to the foreclosure and redemption of mortgages, and to railroad corp'orations.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-6\">The statute defining the equity jurisdiction of this court enumerates, among other subjects within its cognizance, \u201csuits for the redemption of mortgages, or to foreclose the same.\u201d Gen. Sts. <em>e. </em>113, \u00a7 2. Even if this clause could be construed to include mortgages of railroads, yet to hold that such a general provision, in which the Commonwealth is not named, gives this court jurisdiction to entertain suits against the Commonwealth, would be inconsistent with settled rules of construction of statutes, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>would oblige the court to hold that the other clauses in the same section, conferring, in like general terms, jurisdiction in equity of suits for enforcing and regulating the execution of trusts, or for specific performance, or in matters of account, or cases of accident or mistake, or under any other head of chancery jurisdiction, likewise include suits against the Commonwealth.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-3\">Chapter 140 of the General Statutes, entitled \u201c Of the foreclosure and redemption of mortgages,\u201d relates only to mortgages of real estate. The provisions as to mortgages of personal property are contained in <em>o. </em>151, \u00a7\u00a7 1-8, and those as to railroad mortgages in <em>c. </em>63, \u00a7\u00a7 123-131.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-4\">Chapter 140 begins by providing that \u201cafter the breach cf condition of a mortgage of real estate,\u201d the mortgagee may recover possession of \u201c the mortgaged premises \u201d by entry or by action. \u00a7 1. It provides that a certificate of such entry shall be recorded in the registry of deeds of the county \u201c where the land lies; \u201d \u00a7 2; that such action may be brought by the mortgagee, declaring \u201c on his own seisin,\u201d \u201c like a writ of entry,\u201d \u201c against whoever is tenant of the freehold; \u201d \u00a7\u00a7 3, 8; or may be brought and conducted in like manner by an assignee of the mortgage; \u00a7 7; and that the plaintiff, if he prevails, shall either have judgment \u201c for possession as at common law;\u201d or a conditional judgment that if the defendant, within two months, pay the sum adjudged to be due on the mortgage, with interest and costs, he shall hold the premises discharged of the mortgage; otherwise, the plaintiff shall have his execution for possession and for costs. \u00a7\u00a7 4, 5. All these provisions for foreclosure manifestly apply only to mortgages of real estate. So do the sections as to the redemption of mortgages, (\u00a7\u00a7 13-35,) as most clearly appears by the provisions requiring the mortgagee to render an account of rents and profits, and of sums paid for taxes, repairs and improvements; \u00a7\u00a7 15, 21; and the suit for redemption to be brought in the county \u201c where the land lies ; \u201d \u00a7 23; as well as the sections as to mortgages with power of sale, (\u00a7\u00a7 88-44,) which speak of \u201c the equity of redemption of the land demanded,\u201d and of rights of dower. \u00a7\u00a7 41, 44.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-5\">The succeeding sections of the same chapter relate to mortgages to the Commonwealth. By \u00a7 45, \u201cwhen a mortgage is made or assigned to the Commonwealth, the treasurer may demand and receive the money due, and upon payment shall make <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>and acknowledge a discharge of the mortgage.\u201d By \u00a7 46, \u201cif the condition of such mortgage is not duly performed,\u201d possession may be obtained by the treasurer, by entry for the breach of condition, or by \u201c action in the name of the Commonwealth to recover possession of the mortgaged premises; and such possession, obtained either by entry or by action, shall have the same effect in foreclosing the right of redemption as a similar possession by any other mortgagee.\u201d By \u00a7 4,7, \u201c the mortgagor or his assigns may redeem such premises in like manner and upon the same terms as if they were held by any other mortgagee; and the payment or performance of the condition for that purpose shall be made or tendered to the treasurer.\u201d By \u00a7 48, \u201c if the treasurer and the person applying to redeem the mortgage disagree as to the sum due,\u201d a suit in equity for redemption may be brought against the Commonwealth in this court for the county of Suffolk; the treasurer is to be summoned, and appear and answer in behalf of the Commonwealth; \u201c and like proceedings shall be had, and judgment rendered, as are provided in the case of other mortgages; except that the treasurer shall accept any payment due to the Commonwealth, and upon the receipt thereof, or upon the performance of such other act as the court orders, shall discharge the mortgage in like manner as when the debt is paid without suit.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b68-4\">By a familiar rule of construction, these sections are to be construed in connection with the rest of the chapter of which they form part, and with earlier statutes upon the same subject. <em>Eaton </em>v. Green, 22 Pick. 526, 531. <em>Holbrook </em>v. <em>Bliss, </em>9 Allen, 69, 75. The words \u201c a mortgage,\u201d \u201c-such mortgage,\u201d \u201cthe mortgage,\u201d and the provisions for payment and receipt of the money due, for obtaining possession by entry or by action,' and for foreclosure and redemption as in case of \u201c any other mortgagee,\u201d clearly have in contemplation mortgages of real estate such as have been spoken of throughout the chapter, and not mortgages of the entire franchise and property of a railroad corporation. The St. of 1804, <em>o. </em>103, which these sections and the corresponding provisions of the Rev. Sts. <em>c. </em>107, \u00a7\u00a7 35-38, substantially reenact, spoke only of \u201c real estate \u201d mortgaged to the Commonwealth ; and we can have no doubt that those words were omitted, in the reenactment of the St. of 1804 in the revisions of 1836 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>and 1860, simply because, taking into consideration the other provisions already incorporated in the same chapter, they were necessarily implied, and it would have been superfluous to repeat them.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-3\">Chapter 63 of the General Statutes, relating to railroad corporations, after providing in \u00a7 124 that, in case of default in the performance of the condition of a mortgage executed by a railroad corporation of its property, rights and privileges, or any part thereof, to trustees for the benefit of its general creditors, or of any particular class of creditors, the trustees may permit the corporation to take and retain the possession and use of the mortgaged premises upon certain terms; and making provision in \u00a7\u00a7 125-127 as to the reports and returns of trustees in possession of a railroad under a mortgage, the meetings of bondholders or creditors whose claims are secured thereby, the election of trustees, and the confirmation of such election by this court or a justice thereof; provides in \u00a7 128 as follows: \u201c-The Supreme Judicial Court and each of the justices thereof shall have full equity jurisdiction, according to the usage and practice of courts of equity, of all cases arising under the three preceding sections, and of all questions arising out of railroad mortgages, and may in a summary manner remove any trustee under a railroad mortgage, whether such trustee is in possession of the railroad or not, and appoint a new trustee in his stead, whether such trustee is elected by the bondholders or creditors as provided in said sections, or not.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b69-4\">These four sections, which are a reenactment of the St. of 1857, c. 178, do not mention, and evidently have not in view, mortgages to the Commonwealth, but mortgages such as are ordinarily executed by railroad corporations, when authorized by statute, to trustees for the benefit of bondholders or other creditors. The subsequent sections (\u00a7\u00a7 129-131) which reenact the Sts. of 1838, <em>e. </em>99, \u00a7\u00a7 4, 5, and 1843, <em>c. </em>10, and regulate the form, effect and record of mortgages by railroad corporations to the Commonwealth, significantly omit to confer jurisdiction on this or any other court over such mortgages.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-5\">Sections 124-130 of the Gen. Sts. <em>c. </em>63, are left in force and unaltered by the general railroad act of 1874. St. 1874, <em>e. </em>372, \u00a7 182. And the recent statute to provide a remedy for persons <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>having claims against the Commonwealth does not affect this case. St. 1879, <em>a. </em>255, \u00a7 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-4\">The real estate in this Commonwealth, included in the mortgages executed by the -plaintiff corporation, is so connected with its franchise and other property, that redemption cannot be had of the one without the others.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-5\">The result is, that the court has no jurisdiction to entertain this suit, and therefore the demurrer must be sustained, and the</p>\n<p id=\"Ab\">\n<em>Bill dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
