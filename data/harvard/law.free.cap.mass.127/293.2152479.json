Costelo, and by him indorsed in blank. On the margin of the face of the note were these words: \u201c Given as collateral security with agreement.\u201d Writ dated August 10, 1877.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b313-8\">At the trial in the Superior Court, before <em>Allen, </em>J., the defendant asked the judge to rule that the note was not negotiable, and that an action could not be maintained thereon by an indorsee.

As this is decisive of the case, it is unnecessary to consider any other question. <em>Exceptions sustained.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
