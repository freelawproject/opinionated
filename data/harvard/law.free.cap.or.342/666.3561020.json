Petitioners Great American Properties Limited Partnership (Great American) and Randy and Dannette Walker (the Walkers), owners of separate parcels of land in Douglas County, challenged decisions of the Land Use Board of Appeals (LUBA) that relied upon that rule. The Court of Appeals held that the rule\u2019s prohibition on considering gross farm income conflicted with the statutory definition of \u201cfarm use\u201d that is incorporated in Goal 3 and, therefore, that the rule was invalid in part; however, the Court of Appeals upheld the rule\u2019s prohibition of the consideration of profitability. For the reasons that follow, we conclude that both the prohibition on considering gross farm income and the prohibition on considering profitability are invalid. We therefore affirm in part and reverse in part the Court of Appeals decisions in both the Walkers\u2019 case and the Great American case, and we remand those cases to LUBA.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-5\">FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b745-6\">The facts that are pertinent to the issue before us are undisputed. For years, Douglas County has zoned the two properties at issue here for \u201cexclusive farm use \u2014 grazing\u201d and has designated them in the county\u2019s comprehensive plan as \u201cfarm forest transitional.\u201d Petitioners each applied to the county for changes in the zoning designation and comprehensive plan, arguing that their properties no longer should be classified as agricultural or forest lands and no longer should be set aside exclusively for farm or forest uses under statewide planning goals. They contended that the lands were no longer productive and could not profitably be used for farming or grazing. They also asked the county to change the existing zoning designations to allow the creation of five-acre rural residential lots on their properties.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-7\">Several individuals and an organization known as Friends of Douglas County appeared in the proceedings <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"670\">*670</page-number>before the county to oppose the applications. The county, however, granted the applications. The countys decisions turned, in part, on expert assessments of each property that concluded that neither parcel of land could be farmed for profit at a commercial level of productivity. With regard to Great American\u2019s property, the county adopted the experts\u2019 findings that, in light of the relative infertility of the property s soil, its shallowness, and lack of irrigation in the area, the \u201csubject property may well be suitable for farm use as a lifestyle, but is poorly suited for farm use to make a profit.\u201d Among other things, the experts stated that, while 12 percent of the 160-acre parcel was suitable for growing grapes, it nevertheless would be \u201cimpossible to establish a commercial vineyard on the subject property\u201d as a whole. Experts also opined that, although the property could support an average of 17 animal units per year through grazing, that number of livestock was \u201cfar below that of accepted farming practices for livestock grazing in Western Oregon.\u201d As to the Walkers\u2019 property, experts made similar assessments, concluding, among other things, that (1) terrain and soil limitations made the property unsuitable for general crop farming, including \u201ccommercial vineyard or Christmas tree production\u201d; and (2) the 26-acre parcel\u2019s grazing capacity of approximately nine cattle per year \u201cdoes not meet farm use standards because of the low productivity.\u201d Based on those findings, the county concluded that neither property qualified as \u201cagricultural land\u201d under OAR 660-033-0020(l)(a)(B) or (C), or OXb).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The county granted petitioners\u2019 requests that the comprehensive plan and zoning map designations for the properties be changed to allow five-acre rural residential lots.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-4\">PROCEEDINGS FOLLOWING COUNTY LAND USE DECISIONS</p>\n<p id=\"b746-5\">Friends of Douglas County and two individuals who had appeared in the proceedings before the county, including Wetherell, appealed the countys decision with respect to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"671\">*671</page-number>Great American property to LUBA. Wetherell appealed the county\u2019s decision with respect to the Walker property to LUBA.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> LUBA remanded the county\u2019s rezoning determinations for both the subject properties, because it concluded that the county improperly had considered evidence that the properties could not be used profitably for farming or agricultural purposes. In both cases, LUBA based its decision, in substantial part, on OAR 660-033-0030, an administrative rule aimed specifically at identifying agricultural land. Paragraph (5) of the rule provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b747-4\">\u201cNotwithstanding the definition of \u2018farm use\u2019 in ORS 215.203(2)(a), profitability or gross farm income shall not be considered in determining whether land is agricultural land or whether Goal 3, \u2018Agricultural Land,\u2019 is applicable.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b747-5\">Under that rule, LUBA reasoned, direct consideration of the \u201cprofitability\u2019 of the land or of the \u201cgross farm income\u201d that could be generated from the land was improper when determining whether the land was, in fact, agricultural land that must remain zoned for that exclusive purpose. Because LUBA remanded to the county for it to determine whether the land was agricultural land without any direct consideration of profitability, LUBA did not consider Wetherell\u2019s alternative argument that the county improperly had based its decision on a determination that the land would not support \u201ccommercial\u201d agriculture.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-6\">Great American and the Walkers filed separate petitions for judicial review of the LUBA decisions, arguing that OAR 660-033-0030(5) was invalid because the rule conflicted with the statutory definition of \u201cfarm use\u201d in ORS 215.203(2)(a). That definition provides, in part, that \u201c \u2018farm use\u2019 means the current employment of land for the primary purpose of obtaining a <em>profit in money\u201d </em>by raising crops or animals or engaging in other farm activities. (Emphasis added.) Petitioners asserted that the rule, by barring consideration of \u201cprofitability\u201d or \u201cgross farm income,\u201d necessarily conflicted with the \u201cprofit in money\u2019 part of the statutory definition of \u201cfarm use\u201d that is used in Goal 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"672\">*672</page-number>The Court of Appeals, in an opinion dealing with the Great American property, agreed. <em>Wetherell v. Douglas County (A129999), </em>204 Or App 732, 132 P3d 41 (2006).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The Court of Appeals first noted that, under Goal 3, \u201cagricultural land\u201d encompassed, among other land, land in Western Oregon \u201csuitable for \u2018farm use\u2019 \u201d and that Goal 3 expressly incorporated the definition of \u201cfarm use\u201d in ORS 215.203(2)(a).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The court then observed that, in <em>1000 Friends v. Benton County, </em>32 Or App 413, 429, 575 P2d 651, <em>rev den, </em>284 Or 41 (1978), it previously had defined \u201cprofit in money\u201d in ORS 215.203(2)(a) to mean \u201cgross income\u201d and concluded that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b748-4\">\u201cOAR 660-033-0030(5) is invalid as conflicting with Goal 3 insofar as it precludes consideration of either \u2018profitability <em>or </em>gross farm income\u2019 in determining whether land is \u2018agricultural land.\u2019 The rule\u2019s exclusion of consideration of\u2018gross income\u2019 is directly at odds with our holding in <em>1000 Friends </em>that Goal 3\u2019s incorporation of ORS 215.203(2)(a)\u2019s \u2018farm use\u2019 definition includes \u2018profit in money which means \u2018gross income.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b748-5\"><em>Wetherell (A129999), </em>204 Or App at 747 (emphasis in original). In a footnote, the Court of Appeals also stated that, to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"673\">*673</page-number>the extent that the reference to \u201cprofitability\u201d in OAR 660-033-0030(5) could be read to mean profitability in the traditional sense of income minus expenses, its decision in <em>1000 Friends </em>had upheld the rule\u2019s preclusion of profitability so defined. <em>Wetherell, </em>204 Or App at 747 n 11. The Court of Appeals thus affirmed LUBA\u2019s conclusion that profitability could <em>not </em>be considered in determining whether the land was agricultural land. <em>Id.</em><footnotemark><em>5</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b749-4\">The Court of Appeals remanded both cases to LUBA, directing LUBA to \u201crecraft its remand instructions to the county in light of our conclusion that OAR 660-033-0030(5) is invalid insofar as it precludes consideration of \u2018gross income.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 748 (footnote omitted); <em>Wetherell v. Douglas County (A130181), </em>204 Or App 778, 132 P3d 50 (2006) (citing <em>Wetherell (A129999) </em>and reversing and remanding to LUBA for reconsideration).</p>\n<p id=\"b749-5\">Although petitioners prevailed, in part, in the Court of Appeals, they nevertheless filed petitions for review, which we granted. As we describe in greater detail below, petitioners, supported by <em>amicus curiae </em>Oregon Association of Realtors, argue that the Court of Appeals erred in its interpretation of ORS 215.203(2)(a) and, therefore, in the remand instructions that it gave LUBA. In their view, the reference in ORS 215.203(2)(a) to \u201cprofit in money\u201d means \u201cnet profit\u201d \u2014 revenues minus expenses \u2014 rather than \u201cgross income,\u201d as the Court of Appeals held, and they argue that the challenged rule is invalid in its entirety. Specifically, petitioners contend that, for the purposes of ORS 215.203(2)(a), \u201cprofit\u201d has a tax-derived definition that refers \u2014 as the Oregon Tax Court held in <em>Everhart v. Dept. of Rev., </em>15 OTR 76 (1999) \u2014 to net operating income after deducting operating expenses. They argue that \u201cprofit\u201d should be read the same way here.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"674\">*674</page-number>Wetherell<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and <em>amicus curiae </em>Land Conservation and Development Commission (LCDC)<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> disagree with petitioners\u2019 proposed definition of \u201cprofit in money\u201d as \u201cprofit\u201d in the tax sense, and they agree with the Court of Appeals\u2019 rejection of that definition. However, they disagree with the Court of Appeals\u2019 conclusion that ORS 215.203(2)(a) permits the consideration of \u201cgross farm income\u201d and with that court\u2019s related holding that OAR 660-033-0030(5) is invalid to the extent that it prohibits consideration of \u201cgross farm income.\u201d They argue that the disputed rule is valid in its entirety.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-4\">LCDC asks this court to \u201chold that the rule is valid as to profitability [ ] and [to] affirm the decision of [LUBA] holding that the county improperly considered profitability in determining suitability for farm use.\u201d LCDC notes that, under Goal 3, \u201cagricultural land\u201d includes, in addition to specific soil classes that are particularly suited for farming, soils outside those classes that are nevertheless</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b750-5\"><em>\u201csuitable for farm use </em>as defined in ORS 215.203(2)(a), taking into consideration soil fertility; suitability for grazing; climatic conditions; existing and future availability of water for farm irrigation purposes; existing land use patterns; technological and energy inputs required; and accepted farming practices [.]\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b751-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"675\">*675</page-number>OAR. 660-033-0020(l)(a)(B) (emphasis added). LCDC then contends that, because the land at issue here falls within that \u201csuitable for farm use\u201d category, <em>neither </em>actual net profit <em>nor </em>gross farm income are appropriate factors to use in determining whether such property is agricultural land. Specifically, LCDC argues that the rule set out above focuses the \u201csuitability\u2019 determination on the characteristics of the land itself and whether such land can be adapted for farming notwithstanding its current use. The characteristics of \u201cprofitability\u2019 and \u201cgross farm income,\u201d LCDC maintains, are not only easily manipulated, but, more importantly, they are not inherent characteristics of land. Therefore, OAR 660-033-0030(5) properly prohibits a factfinder from considering them in determining whether particular land is agricultural land for purposes of Goal 3. For that reason, LCDC argues, LUBA correctly decided this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-4\">AGRICULTURAL LAND AND GOAL 3</p>\n<p id=\"b751-5\">We begin by emphasizing the specific issue before this court. We are not asked to determine whether the countys decision regarding petitioners\u2019 properties was correct or the weight to be given testimony that a particular property is \u201cprofitable\u201d or not or whether it can generate \u201cgross farm income\u201d or not. Rather, the issue presented instead involves the kind of information that the county properly may <em>consider </em>in making a land use decision involving agricultural land under Goal 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-6\">We turn to a brief overview of Oregon\u2019s agricultural land use policy. The legislature\u2019s policy regarding agricultural land was set out almost 35 years ago and seeks to preserve \u201ca maximum amount of the limited supply of agricultural land\u201d in the state. ORS 215.243. That statute provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b751-7\">\u201cThe Legislative Assembly finds and declares that:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b751-8\">\u201c(1) Open land used for agricultural use is an efficient means of conserving natural resources that constitute an important physical, social, aesthetic and economic asset to all of the people of this state, whether living in rural, urban or metropolitan areas of the state.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b752-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"676\">*676</page-number>\u201c(2) <em>The preservation of a maximum amount of the limited supply of agricultural land is necessary to the conservation of the state\u2019s economic resources and the preservation of such land in large blocks is necessary in maintaining the agricultural economy of the state and for the assurance of adequate, healthful and nutritious food for the people of this state and nation.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b752-4\">\u201c(3) Expansion of urban development into rural areas is a matter of public concern because of the unnecessary increases in costs of community services, conflicts between farm and urban activities and the loss of open space and natural beauty around urban centers occurring as the result of such expansion.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b752-5\">\u201c(4) Exclusive farm use zoning as provided by law, substantially limits alternatives to the use of rural land and, with the importance of rural lands to the public, justifies incentives and privileges offered to encourage owners of rural lands to hold such lands in exclusive farm use zones.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b752-6\">ORS 215.243 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b752-7\">The legislature has directed LCDC to implement Oregon statutes by adopting land use planning \u201cgoals\u201d that \u201cset out broad objectives for land use planning in Oregon.\u201d <em>Save Our Rural Oregon v. Energy Facility Siting, </em>339 Or 353, 361, 121 P3d 1141 (2005); <em>see also </em>ORS 197.225 (LCDC \u201cshall adopt goals and guidelines\u201d for government agencies to use in preparing comprehensive land use plans). The legislature also authorized LCDC to adopt <em>rules </em>to implement the land use planning statutes and goals, ORS 197.040(l)(b), and all parties agree that LCDC\u2019s rules are valid only if they are consistent with both the applicable statutes and goals. <em>See City of West Linn v. LCDC, </em>200 Or App 269, 275-76, 113 P3d 935, <em>rev den, </em>339 Or 609 (2006) (so stating, noting that goals occupy a \u201cpreferred position\u201d over rules). Pursuant to the legislature\u2019s mandate, LCDC has created and implemented 19 goals for comprehensive planning in Oregon.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> At issue in this case is Goal 3 (Agricultural Lands), which is meant to facilitate the preservation of agricultural land, as directed by ORS 215.243. Goal 3 provides, in part:<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b753-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"677\">*677</page-number>\u201cAgricultural lands shall be preserved and maintained for farm use, consistent with existing and future needs for agricultural products, forest and open space and with the state\u2019s agricultural land use policy expressed in ORS 215.243 and 215.700.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b753-4\">In the definition section of Goal 3, \u201cagricultural land\u201d is defined, as noted previously, to include land that consists predominantly of certain soil types \u201cand other lands which are <em>suitable for farm use\u201d </em>taking into consideration various factors. (Emphasis added.) The dispute at issue here relates to the \u201csuitable for farm use\u201d aspect of Goal 3. \u201cFarm use\u201d in Goal 3 is defined simply \u201cas set forth in ORS 215.203,\u201d a statute that we quoted previously. 342 Or at 672 n 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-5\">With that background, we return to the issue that this case presents. Under Goal 3, land must be preserved as agricultural land if it is suitable for \u201cfarm use\u201d as defined in ORS 215.203(2)(a), which means, in part, \u201cthe current employment of land for the primary purpose of obtaining a <em>profit in money\u201d </em>through specific farming-related endeavors. OAR 660-033-0030(5), however, expressly <em>prohibits </em>consideration of \u201cprofitability or gross farm income\u201d as factors in Goal 3 land determinations. (Emphasis added.) If application of the statutory phrase \u201cprofit in money\u201d permits or requires a local government to consider \u201cprofitability or gross farm income,\u201d then the rule directly conflicts with the statute (and with Goal 3, which refers to the statute) and the rule is invalid. The question then is whether such a conflict exists.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-6\">DEFINITION OF \u201cPROFIT IN MONEY\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b753-7\">To answer that question, we must construe the phrase \u201cprofit in money\u201d in ORS 215.203(2)(a) and the terms \u201cprofitability\u201d and \u201cgross farm income\u201d in OAR 660-033-0030(5). In interpreting a statute, this court\u2019s task is to give effect to the legislature\u2019s intent. <em>PGE v. Bureau of Labor and </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"678\">*678</page-number><em>Industries, </em>317 Or 606, 610, 859 P2d 1143 (1993). To do so, we begin by considering the text and context of the statute, <em>id. </em>at 610-11, giving \u201cwords of common usage * * * their plain, natural, and ordinary meaning.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 611. A statute\u2019s context \u201cincludes other provisions of the same statute and other related statutes, as well as the preexisting common law and the statutory framework within which the law was enacted!.]\u201d <em>Denton and Denton, </em>326 Or 236, 241, 951 P2d 693 (1998) (internal citations omitted). This court does not \u201clook at one subsection of a statute in a vacuum; rather, we construe each part together with the other parts in an attempt to produce a harmonious whole.\u201d <em>Lane County v. LCDC, </em>325 Or 569, 578, 942 P2d 278 (1997). In construing administrative rules, our task is the same: we must discern the meaning of the words used, giving effect to the intent of the body that promulgated the rule. <em>Tye v. McFetridge, </em>342 Or 61, 69, 149 P3d 1111 (2006). To do so, we follow the same methodology for interpreting rules as for construing statutes. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b754-4\">We begin with the text of the statute itself. The legislature did not define \u201cprofit,\u201d as that term is used in ORS 215.203(2)(a). Similarly, LCDC did not define \u201cprofitability\u201d or \u201cgross farm income\u201d in the rule that it adopted to implement Goal 3. Moreover, this court has not interpreted any of those terms in the context of the statutes and rules at issue in this case.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> We therefore begin by looking to the dictionary for the \u201cplain, natural, and ordinary\u201d meaning of the term \u201cprofit.\u201d As is so often the case, the dictionary offers several plausible definitions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b754-5\">\u201c1: an advantage, benefit, accession of good, gain, or valuable return esp. in financial matters, education, or character development * * * 2 : the excess of returns over expenditures in a transaction or series of transactions: as a : the excess of the price received over the price paid for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"679\">*679</page-number>goods sold \u2014 opposed to <em>loss </em>b : the excess of the price received over the cost of purchasing and handling or of producing and marketing goods 3a (1): net income (as in a business) usu. for a given period of time (2): a benefit or advantage accruing from the management, use, or sale of property, from the carrying on of any process of production, or from the conduct of business b : the income of invested property not including an appreciation in market value. * * * <em>\u00bb</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b755-4\"><em>Webster\u2019s Third New Int\u2019l Dictionary </em>1811 (unabridged ed 2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b755-6\">As used in the statutory definition of \u201cfarm use,\u201d the word \u201cprofit\u201d is modified by the words \u201cin money.\u201d For that reason, we reject the first definition quoted above, under which \u201cprofit\u201d could be <em>any </em>\u201cadvantage\u201d or \u201cbenefit,\u201d because that definition would include a sentimental or psychological benefit to the ownership of land, which the statute, by using the words \u201cprofit in money,\u201d clearly excludes. The second sense of the word \u201cprofit\u201d quoted above includes both the concepts of monetary \u201creturns\u201d or \u201cprice received\u201d <em>and </em>the \u201cexpenditures\u201d or \u201ccost\u201d associated with producing those returns or receipts, and defines profit as the \u201cexcess\u201d of the former over the latter. The third sense similarly incorporates the concept of revenues minus expenses by referring to \u201cnet income,\u201d which the dictionary defines as \u201cthe balance of gross income remaining after deducting related costs and expenses usu[ally] for a given period and losses allocable to the period.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1520. Although several of the specific subsenses of \u201cprofit\u201d provided by the dictionary \u2014 such as those referring to the purchase and resale of goods or the \u201cincome of invested property\u201d \u2014 do not apply to the employment of land for \u201cfarm use,\u201d the second and third senses described in the dictionary demonstrate that \u201cprofit in money\u201d must include some consideration of expenses or costs, as well as of revenues or income.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-7\">Two other definitions are also relevant here. \u201cProfitability\u201d means the quality or state of \u201cbringing or yielding benefits or gains,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 1811, and its specific meaning in the context of this case turns on the proper definition of \u201cprofit.\u201d \u201cGross\u201d in conjunction with \u201cincome\u201d means consisting of \u201can overall total exclusive of deductions.\u201d Id. at 1002.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"680\">*680</page-number>Applying those definitions to the statute and rule at issue, we conclude that in determining whether land is \u201csuitable\u201d for \u201cfarm use\u201d \u2014 defined in ORS 215.203(2) as \u201cthe current employment of the land for the primary purpose of obtaining a profit in money\u201d by engaging in specified farm or agricultural activities \u2014 a local government may not be precluded from considering the costs or expenses of engaging in those activities. Each of the relevant definitions of \u201cprofit\u201d discussed above uses that word to mean the \u201cexcess\u201d or the \u201cnet\u201d of the gain or receipts from the particular activity over the associated costs or expenditures, and we conclude that the statute refers to \u201cprofit\u201d in that sense.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-4\">We therefore reject the alternative definitions offered by the Court of Appeals and by petitioners. Nothing in the words of ORS 215.203(2)(a) requires, or provides any support for, the Court of Appeals\u2019 definition of the word \u201cprofit\u201d to mean \u201cgross income.\u201d <em>Evidence </em>of the gross income that has been or could be generated from the farm use of a parcel of land may well be relevant in determining whether the land is or could be employed for the \u201cprimary purpose of obtaining a profit,\u201d but, to put it bluntly, \u201cprofit\u201d does not mean \u201cgross income.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b756-5\"> Similarly, petitioners\u2019 proposed definition of profit to mean only \u201cnet operating profit\u201d also is inconsistent with ORS 215.203(2)(a), because it focuses on current or potential profitability in a tax or accounting sense, while that statute and Goal 3 require the local government to determine whether the land is \u201csuitable\u201d for current use \u201cfor the <em>primary purpose </em>of obtaining a profit in money\u201d through certain <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"681\">*681</page-number>agricultural or farm activities. (Emphasis added.) As this court has been careful to recognize, \u201c[Hand use laws reflect different policies than tax laws.\u201d <em>King Estate Winery, Inc. v. Dept. of Rev., </em>329 Or 414, 422, 988 P2d 369 (1999). With respect to \u201cfarm use\u201d determinations for tax purposes, the legislature has stated its intent, in part, to ensure that <em>\u201cbona fide farm properties </em>be assessed * * * at a value that is exclusive of values attributable to urban influences or speculative purposes.\u201d ORS 308A.050 (emphasis added). In such a context, strictly defining \u201cprofit\u201d as a current year income-after-expenses accounting calculation is appropriate, because it allows for a more precise description of the discrete class of properties that are entitled to certain tax benefits due to their <em>current </em>operation as bona fide farms. In contrast, the identification of land that is \u201csuitable for farm use\u201d under Goal 3 can involve the consideration of factors as diverse as soil type, water availability, land use patterns, required energy inputs, and accepted farming practices.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Land can be suitable for economically successful and sustainable farm use and yet the landowner, because of tax and accounting concepts such as accelerated depreciation and loss carry-forwards, legitimately may show a net operating loss from such use. For those reasons, petitioners\u2019 proposed tax-based definition of \u201cprofit in money\u201d to mean <em>only </em>net operating income after deducting operating expenses is inconsistent with the text and context of ORS 215.203(2)(a). Nevertheless, as set forth above, petitioners are correct to the extent that they argue that net operating profit properly can be <em>considered </em>in determining whether land can be employed for the primary purpose of obtaining a profit in money.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-4\">We further conclude that the meaning of \u201cprofitability,\u201d as used in OAR 660-033-0030(5), essentially mirrors that of \u201cprofit.\u201d For the reasons described above, that rule\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"682\">*682</page-number>prohibition of any consideration of \u201cprofitability\u201d in agricultural land use determinations conflicts with the definition of \u201cfarm use\u201d in ORS 215.203(2)(a) and Goal 3, which permit such consideration. OAR 660-033-0030(5) is therefore invalid, because it prohibits consideration of \u201cprofitability.\u201d The factfinder may consider \u201cprofitability,\u201d which includes consideration of the monetary benefits or advantages that are or may be obtained from the farm use of the property <em>and </em>the costs or expenses associated with those benefits, to the extent such consideration is consistent with the remainder of the definition of \u201cagricultural land\u201d in Goal 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-4\">Finally, the prohibition in OAR 660-033-0030(5) of the consideration of \u201cgross farm income\u201d in determining whether a particular parcel of land is suitable for farm use also is invalid. As discussed above, \u201cprofit\u201d is the excess or the net of the returns or receipts over the costs or expenses associated with the activity that produced the returns. To determine whether there is or can be a \u201cprofit in money\u201d from the \u201ccurrent employment of [the] land * * * by raising, harvesting and selling crops [,]\u201d a factfinder can consider the gross income that is, or could be, generated from the land in question, in addition to other considerations that relate to \u201cprofit\u201d or are relevant under ORS 215.203(2)(a) and Goal 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-5\">We therefore hold that, because Goal 3 provides that \u201cfarm use\u201d is defined by ORS 215.203, which includes a definition of \u201cfarm use\u201d as \u201cthe current employment of land for the primary purpose of obtaining a profit in money [,]\u201d LCDC may not preclude a local government making a land use decision from considering \u201cprofitability\u201d or \u201cgross farm income\u201d in determining whether land is \u201cagricultural land\u201d because it is \u201csuitable for farm use\u201d under Goal 3. Because OAR 660-033-0030(5) precludes such consideration, it is invalid.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Accordingly, on remand, LUBA must reconsider its decision with respect to the county\u2019s land use determinations at issue here <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"683\">*683</page-number>in light of that conclusion and our interpretation of the applicable statutes and rules.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-4\">Although profitability and gross farm income \u2014 both actual and potential \u2014 may be considered in determining whether land is suitable for farm use, we do not address the weight to be given to those considerations in any particular land use decision. In their arguments before LUBA, the Court of Appeals, and this court, the parties and <em>amici </em>appear to assume, at times, that, if particular land currently is \u201cprofitable\u201d or produces \u201cgross farm income,\u201d then that land necessarily meets the \u201cfarm use\u201d test and is properly classified as agricultural land under Goal 3, whereas if the land is \u201cunprofitable\u201d for farming or produces no \u201cgross farm income,\u201d then it necessarily is not agricultural land under Goal 3. The case before us, in its particular posture, does not present those issues. The determination that a particular parcel of land is \u201cagricultural land\u201d turns instead on the local government\u2019s conclusion, subject to review by LUBA and the courts, that the land is <em>\u201csuitable </em>for farm use,\u201d taking into consideration the factors identified in Goal 3. (Emphasis added.) The only issue that we decide today is whether \u201cprofitability\u201d or \u201cgross farm income\u201d can be <em>considered </em>by the local government in making its land use decision, and our decision is limited to holding that the rule prohibiting the local government even from considering such evidence is invalid.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-5\">The decisions of the Court of Appeals are affirmed in part and reversed in part. The decisions of the Land Use Board of Appeals are reversed, and the cases are remanded to the Land Use Board of Appeals for further proceedings.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b746-6\"> The county also determined that neither parcel was \u201cforest land\u201d within the meaning of Goal 4 of Oregon\u2019s land use planning policy. LUBA reversed that determination, and the Court of Appeals affirmed LUBA\u2019s decision. No party petitioned for review of that decision, and that issue is not before this court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b747-7\"><em> </em>For convenience, we refer to the parties that appealed the cases to LUBA and that are respondents on review in this court, collectively, as \u201cWetherell.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b748-6\"> The court then decided the case involving the Walker property in a brief per curiam decision citing its opinion in the Great American property case. <em>Wetherell v.

In a concurring opinion, Justice Holman discussed the statute and pointed out that the parties had failed to address the question whether the land, if subdivided, could be used \u201cfor the purpose of obtaining a profit in money,\u201d and therefore constitute \u201cfarm use.\u201d 287 Or at 679-80 (Holman, J., concurring).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b756-6\"> As noted previously, 342 Or at 672, the Court of Appeals followed its prior interpretation of ORS 215.203 in <em>1000 Friends. 1000 </em>Friends, however, was based on a provision of the statute that had been repealed by the legislature in 1973. Prior to that year, the statute qualified the \u201cprofit in money\u201d requirement with a \u201cgross income\u201d clause that established a threshold of current commercial activity as part of its definition of \u201cfarm use.\u201d <em>See </em>ORS 215.203(2)(b) (1971) (providing that land not be regarded as used for making a profit in money \u201cif the whole parcel has not produced a gross income from farm uses of $500 per year for three of the [last] five calendar years[.]\u201d). The legislature deleted the gross income test in 1973. Or Laws 1973, ch 503, \u00a7 3. That action eliminated any statutory basis from which to infer that the landowner must attain a particular level of <em>current </em>economic activity for land to be classified as \u201cfarm use\u201d land under the statute.
