In the affidavit upon which the motion was made, Sherer swears that he did not know, until a motion was made on behalf of Voorhees to vacate the order of reference, that Voorhees had not been properly made a party to this proceeding. A copy of the order of May 24, 1906, had been served upon him, and he knew of the method for the service of the order directed, and, if he had wished to take the objection that all parties were not before the court, he should have taken it on the return of that order, and, not having done so, it is waived. So far as appears, the only objection that was taken before the referee was that the order was unconstitutional and void. The specific objection that there was a defect of parties to the special proceeding was not taken, either before the court at Special Term on the return of the order to show cause or be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>fore the referee. It also appears that the order of May 34, 1906, was affirmed by this court. 100 N. Y. Supp. 1124, 114 App. Div. 912. The question as to what, if any, final order should be entered in this proceeding, can be raised upon the motion to confirm the referee's-report.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-5\">The order should be affirmed, with $10 costs and disbursements. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
