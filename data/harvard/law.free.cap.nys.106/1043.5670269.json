On a demurrer he is entitled to have the facts stated in the complaint taken as true, and all reasonable inferences are to be resolved in his favor. The defendants say the complaint does not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action, in that there is no sufficient allegation of negligence or lack of contributory negligence. Defendants claim that the complaint should contain averments that the accident did not result from a risk assumed by the servant and that the accident was not due to the negligence of fellow servants. These last two contentions are clearly wrong. Plaintiff is not obliged to plead either of the propositions advanced. They are matters for defendant to allege or to prove on the trial. Rooney v. Brogan Construction Co., 107 App. Div. 258, 95 N. Y. Supp. 1. There are decisions holding that a complaint in a negligence action is good, without an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1044\">*1044</page-number>allegation \u25a0 of absence of contributory negligence, and that defendant must plead- in his answer that the negligence is the negligence of fellow servants. I do not agree with these decisions, but I refer to them as evidencing the view which the courts, take of these matters; the object being to arrive at a just determination of the action on the merits. Plaintiff must allege that -defendants were guilty of negligence, but he is not called upon to plead all the details of the evidence and negative every possible defense which may be interposed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b1068-6\">This demurrer was stricken out as frivolous, but the order was reversed by the Appellate Division. Shaw v. Feltman, 99 App. Div. 514, 91 N. Y. Supp. 114. The' Appellate Division did not, however, pass upon the sufficiency of the -complaint. Judged by the standards laid down in innumerable decisions, and giving the plaintiff the benefit of the facts and reasonable inferences, I think the complaint is good. He says he was employed by the defendants to work <em>in </em>a kitchen in a building owned and controlled by defendants in Coney Island; that there was a skylight over the kitchen, and that the skylight and the glass therein were in a defective, ruinous, and dangerous condition, of all of which the defendants had notice; that a piece of glass fell from the skylight, coming in contact with plaintiff and injuring him. It may be that the \u00a1mere allegation that the glass fell, without a distinct averment that it fell \u25a0by reason of the defective and dangerous condition alleged, would not be sufficient ; but this very fact is set forth in paragraph 8. It is there stated that \u25a0the glass fell because of the defective and ruinous and broken condition in which it was maintained by defendants, with full knowledge, a condition described as \u201cdangerous.\u201d A master cannot put his servants to work in a place -known to him to be dangerous, unsafe, and with defective skylights and ceilings liable to fall and injure the employ\u00e9, without incurring liability. If the \u25a0servant knew of the condition, if he assumed the risk, if he was guilty of -contributory negligence, if it was a risk incident to his employment, or if the accident happened by reason of his own or his fellow servants\u2019 negligence, he \u25a0cannot recover; but all these things are matters of proof. I think the complaint is good.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b1068-7\">Demurrer overruled, with leave to defendants to answer upon payment of costs.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b1068-8\">Argued before WOODWARD, JENKS, HOOKER, GAYNOR, and RICH, JJ.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b1068-9\">Joseph M.
