For the purposes of this appeal, the verdict for the defendants having been directed by the court, all contested facts must be treated as established in favor of the plaintiff. It appears then that in January, 1904, the plaintiff had two conversations with one of the defendants at their offices, during which he was told what the margin and rate of brokerage would be, and was assured by the defendant Dillingham that the defendants would not close out his account without calling on him for more margin. Thereupon, and in pursuance of this understanding, the plaintiff transferred his account from another broker, and began doing a marginal business in cotton through the defendants, spending most of his time at their office, eating his luncheons and having his address there. When during business hours he was not there, he was in the Cotton Exchange gallery, three minutes distant. After each purchase or sale by the plaintiff of a contract for the future delivery of cotton, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>one of the defendants\u2019 clerks would hand the plaintiff a written memorandum showing the amount, price, and time of the particular cotton bought or sold. These memoranda were made upon a .printed form, at the foot of which, among other printed matter, appeared the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b203-5\">\u201cIt is further understood that on all marginal business the right is reserved to close transactions when margins are running out, without further notice, and to settle contracts in accordance with rules and customs of Exchange where order is executed. Hubbard Bros. &amp; Co.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b203-6\">The plaintiff is an Armenian, uneducated, reads with difficulty, and never read the printed matter on these memorandum slips. On Saturday, June 11, 1904, at about 10:30 in the forenoon, the plaintiff, while in the defendants\u2019 office, told the margin clerk that he wished to buy 200 bales of July cotton. The clerk, saying, \u201cLet me see if you have enough margin,\u201d figured the margin, said, \u201cYes; you can buy it,\u201d and ordered another clerk to buy it for the plaintiff. A few minutes later the plaintiff was handed a memorandum, Exhibit 9, reading: \u201c10:36 Mr. Bosoian bought two July 12:20 H. B.\u201d At that time the ticker gave the price of cotton as 12.07, but, on calling the clerk\u2019s attention to the large difference in price against him, the plaintiff was told that it was a mistake. He delared his intention to go next door to the gallery of the Cotton Exchange, and asked the clerk to let him know if it became necessary to put up more margin, and the clerk said, \u201cAll right.\u201d At about 15 minutes before 12, while in the gallery of the Exchange, the plaintiff heard 12.41 offered for July cotton, went back to defendants\u2019 office to sell at the considerable profit then appearing, and found that he had been sold out at 12.22. The clerk, in explanation, told him that they thought cotton was going down, and \"Mr. Dillingham didn\u2019t let me send to you over on the Cotton Exchange gallery. He said to me, \u2018Close him out,\u2019 and so I closed you out.\u201d Much of the foregoing was controverted by the defendants\u2019 witnesses, but this only raised a question of fact for the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-7\">At the close of all the evidence, the learned trial court directed a verdict for the defendant on the ground that the contract was modified by the plaintiff\u2019s \u201csilent acquiescence, despite the repeated notices of that modification\u201d; that is, the paragraph above quoted, which purported to reserve to the defendants the right to close out marginal transactions without notice. An exception was duly taken to the dismissal of the complaint. No authority has been cited in support of this theory of modification, nor have I been able to find any. If it is sound, a party to a contract may modify it by.giving repeated notices of his \u201cmodification\u201d to the other party, provided the latter silently receives them; they being printed on slips carrying brief written memoranda made necessary by the nature of the contract. This cannot be true, for there is no mutuality of agreement which is as indispensable to the modification as to the making of a contract. The waiver of a provision of a contract is in effect a modification of it, and the Court of Appeals has held that a waiver cannot be inferred from mere silence. Titus v. Glens Falls Ins. Co., 81 N. Y. 410, 418.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-8\">No modification was made out in the case at bar. The case should <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>have been submitted to the jury, and the judgment should therefore be reversed, and a new trial granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-4\">Judgment and order reversed and new trial granted, costs to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
