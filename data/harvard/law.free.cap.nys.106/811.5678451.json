The order was made after the judgment containing such injunction \"had been affirmed by this court and the Court of Appeals. McCarty v. Natural Carbonic Gas Co., 114 App. Div. 908, 100 N. Y. Supp. 1127; S. C., 189 N. Y. 46, 81 N. E. 549, It is now urged by the appellant that the Special Term was without jurisdiction to grant the order in question, as its effect was to modify a judgment after \u25a0its affirmance by the court of last resort.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-15\">The order was made July 19, 1907. It in terms suspended the injunction \u201cfor 30 days from the date hereof.\u201d Such suspension expired, therefore, on August 19, 1907, over a month before the argument of this appeal. There remains, therefore, only an abstract or \u25a0academic question for determination. Nothing now stands in the way of the enforcement of the plaintiff\u2019s judgment according to its terms. No practical result can be reached by deciding the question, and, following the course usual in such cases, we think we should dismiss the appeal. Fleischman v. Fleischman, 80 Hun, 90, 30 N. Y. Supp. 22; Matter of Woodworth, 64 Hun, 522, 19 N. Y. Supp. 525; People ex rel. Geer v. Com. Council of Troy, 82 N. Y. 579; Matter of Manning, 139 N. Y. 446, 34 N.
