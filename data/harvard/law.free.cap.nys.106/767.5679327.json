No contract was entered into by the principals, and the only question involved is whether the plaintiff showed that he produced a purchaser able to purchase on the defendant\u2019s terms. One of'the terms was a cash payment of $25,000. The proposed purchaser testified that he had in his possession funds sufficient to carry out the cofitract, but his cross-ex-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"768\">*768</page-number>animation showed that his assets consisted of a stock of groceries, the value of which was not shown, and a cause of action for $10,000 or $12,000 against third parties for money loaned, and that he had no funds in his possession.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-5\">I think this fell short of proving his ability to pay $25,000 cash, and advise that the judgment and order be reversed. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
