There was no other vehicle in the vicinity, and nothing to prevent the plaintiff from seeing the car all the time. Having seen the car that distance away as he was stepping on the track, it was impossible for him to be struck by the car by the time he got to the middle of the track unless he negligently remained in the way. One witness says the headlight <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>went out as the car was going the said distance and then lighted up again; but if this be believed it makes no difference for the plaintiff says he saw the car.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-5\">The judgment should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-6\">Judgment unanimously affirmed on reargument, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
