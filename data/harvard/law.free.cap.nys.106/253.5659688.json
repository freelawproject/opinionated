The defendants agreed to pay for such work the sum of $645, payable $175 in advance and the balance in weekly payments as the printing was used, beginning on or about June 17th, but all to be paid for by January 1, 1906, whether used or not. It was further provided that the .plaintiff should store, at the defendants\u2019 risk and expense, any balance of printing remaining on hand at the close of the season. One Isham was engaged by Kindermann as manager of the band, with the knowledge of the defendant Heitmann, who'testified: \u201cThat was left between Kindermann and Isham to make the arrangements\u201d for the printing. Isham directed plaintiff on different occasions to ship stated quantities of the advertising matter so contracted for to places named by him, where he received such shipments and used them in advertising the band. He subsequently ordered additional printing amounting to $275. It was not shown that the defendant Heitmann authorized or had knowledge of this purchase. Payments were made upon the contract from time to time, and this action was brought to recover a balance unpaid on the contract, including the value of the extra printing ordered by Isham; the plaintiff\u2019s theory being that Heitmann was the owner and financial backer of the band, and that Isham, in ordering the additional printing, acted as the agent of Heitmann, with authority. The secretary of the plaintiff company was examined as a witness upon a commission, and the answers made by him to the interrogatories showing performance of the contract by plaintiff were excluded by the trial court upon objection made that such interrogatories were incompetent as calling for the conclusion of the witness. At the close of the plaintiff\u2019s evidence the trial court held that a cause of action was not established by the evidence, and dismissed the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-11\">In this I think it was in error. The plaintiff\u2019s right to recover the unpaid balance upon the contract did not rest upon the relation- Heit<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>mann sustained to the German Marine Band, the delivery of the printed matter, or whether Isham, in ordering the additional printing, was Heitmann\u2019s authorized agent. Upon establishing the contract, and showing the printing, the plaintiff was entitled to recover of the defendant Heitmann such unpaid balance. The contract and amount unpaid thereon were admitted. Delivery by the plaintiff was not required by the contract. The plaintiff agreed to do the printing, ready for delivery, and hold it subject to defendants\u2019 orders. It was to be paid for, whether used or not. It was shown by the evidence of one Lynch that the posters were printed. Isham testified that the quantity thereof stated and ordered by him in his letters and telegrams were actually received by him and used as manager of the band, and Lynch testified that the balance was stored in plaintiff\u2019s warehouse in Cleveland. This evidence established a prima facie case entitling the plaintiff to recover the balance past due and concededly unpaid upon the contract, and the dismissal of the complaint was error. As this conclusion requires a reversal of the judgment, we do not deem it expedient to consider the many other questions presented, which will presumably not arise upon a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-4\">The judgment of the Municipal Court must be reversed, and a new trial ordered; costs to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
