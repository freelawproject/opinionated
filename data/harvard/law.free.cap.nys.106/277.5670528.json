By chapter 532, p. 1448\u00bb. of the Laws of 1906 this scheme was superseded by provisions whidb substituted a recording tax on mortgages thereafter to be made, and; exempting all mortgages so taxed from taxation by local authorities\u00bb The provisions for the tax of one-half of one per cent, on previous-mortgages was dropped, and no other tax was prescribed in its stead.. This left such mortgages subject to general taxation under sections <em>2' </em>and 3 of the tax law, which include mortgages in the enumeration of taxable property. The contention that this is unconstitutional for impairing a contract between the state' and individuals by the said, act off 1905 is based on nothing and requires no discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-17\">The judgment should be affirmed, with costs.
