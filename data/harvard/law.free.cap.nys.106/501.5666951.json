The judgment demanded is that plaintiff have an equitable lien upon the property to the extent of 10 per cent, of the profits or increase in value of said property; that, in the event of a sale by the defendants of the said property, an accounting be had; and that after the sale the defendants be required to pay to the plaintiff such sum of money as shall be ascertained to be due to her, and for other relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-5\">It is clear that upon this allegation of the complaint there was no equitable lien, but all that plaintiff had was a claim against Trask\u2019s estate for 10 per cent, of the profits arising from the increase in value of the real estate purchased by the plaintiff as broker for Trask whenever the said Trask should sell, dispose of, or convey the said property purchased by the plaintiff. The allegations in this complaint are entirely different from those in Lindheim v. Central Nat. Realty &amp; Cons. Co., 111 App. Div. 275, 9-7 N. Y. Supp. 619, which was an action where a sale of the property and division of the proceeds was sought. There is no such demand for judgment in this case. The only demand that could possibly affect the property is that it be adjudged that the plaintiff had an equitable lien upon the property; but that is entirely inconsistent with the allegations of the complaint. The case of Brox v. Riker, 56 App. Div. 388, 67 N. Y. Supp. 772, is in point, where it was' said:</p>\n<p id=\"b526-6\">\u201cWhere there are no allegations in the complaint which would bring the action within the class of those which affect the title to real' property, a mere demand for a judgment which is entirely foreign to the cause of action alleged would not justify the plaintiff in filing the notice.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b526-7\">The case of Beman v. Todd, 124 N. Y. 114, 26 N. E. 326, was an action to recover a sum. of money that had been wrongfully 'invested by the defendant in pieces of real estate\u2014a case which gave to the plaintiff, if the facts could be proved, an interest in the real property. .In the present case the allegation was that the plaintiff was entitled to receive as compensation for his services an amount which was to be fixed by reference to the profits of a sale of the real property when realized; but it gave the plaintiff no greater interest in the real property than if the amount of commissions was fixed by agreement absolutely and not dependent upon the amount of profit realized.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-8\">The order should therefore be reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and the motion granted, with $10 costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
