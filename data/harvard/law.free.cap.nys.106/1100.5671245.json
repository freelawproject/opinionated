The case of Bernheimer v. Kelleher, 31 Mise. Rep. 464, 64 N. Y. Supp. 409, seems to cover the case at bar, and calls for a reversal of this order. It was there held by this court that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1125-10\">\u201cFalse swearing by a judgment debtor, committed, upon his examination in supplementary proceedings, touching the disposition of his property, is neither a civil nor a criminal contempt, and he cannot be punished therefor by fine and imprisonment, especially where it does not appear that a right or remedy was impaired, impeded, or defeated.\u2019\u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1125-11\">Order reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and motion denied, with $10 costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
