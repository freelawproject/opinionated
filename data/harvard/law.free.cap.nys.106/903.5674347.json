It is there expressly provided that a commission to examine wholly or partly upon oral questions could not be issued where the witness to be examined- is a party to the action and is making the application on his own behalf, except by consent of the parties (Ordway v. Radigan, 114 App. Div. 538, 100 N. Y. Supp. 131) ; and the provision that the witness is to be examined \u201cupon such oral -questions at said examination as the counsel for the plaintiffs and the defendant may think proper\u201d is, therefore, unauthorized. It seems to me, however, that the plaintiffs\u2019 proceedings were stayed in consequence of their having failed to give the security for costs required \"by the order of August, 1896. That order required that the plaintiffs either deposit the sum of $350 to be applied to the payment \u25a0of the costs, if any, awarded against them, or, at their election, file with the clerk of the county of New York an undertaking to the defendant, with two sureties, to the effect that they would pay upon demand to the defendant all costs which may be awarded to him in the action, not exceeding $500. No such undertaking has been filed. No motion was made to vacate or modify this order. The plaintiffs <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"904\">*904</page-number>filed an undertaking for $250 which was served upon the defendant, but that was not a complianc\u00e9 with the order of the court, and the stay was not thereby vacated. The fact that the defendant did not return the undertaking as not a compliance with the order did not waive or 'vacate the stay. The order was not void. It stayed the plaintiffs\u2019 proceedings until such undertaking should be filed and served; and the plaintiffs were not authorized to comply with the order of tire court so far as it pleased them, and disregard its other provisions, and then claim, because the defendant had simply rested upon' the order, its provisions were waived.</p>\n<p id=\"b928-5\">The order appealed from should be reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and the motion denied, with $10 costs, with leave to renew the application for a commission upon written interrogatories when the order requiring security for costs is complied with. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
