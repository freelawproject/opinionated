If the Brown &amp; Fleming Contracting Company, the deceased\u2019s employer, was negligent in the performance of its duty in providing the deceased with a safe place to work, it would have been liable, whether the New York Contracting Company was or was not negligent. If, on the other hand, the New York Contracting Company was negligent in allowing this bucket to fall, it was liable, irrespective of any negligence of the Brown &amp; Fleming Contracting Company. In other words, the parties did,not concur in the same negligent act which caused the injury. There are, therefore, two causes of action alleged against two separate defendants, based upon distinct acts of negligence; the Brown &amp; Fleming Company not being responsible for the acts charged against the New York Contracting Company as negligent, and the New York Contracting Company not being responsible for those charged as negligent acts of the Brown &amp; Fleming Company. There were not, therefore, concurring acts of negligence, which could impose a liability upon the two defendants, upon which they could be held liable in one cause of action, but two causes of action, based upon distinct acts of negligence of different parties. The plaintiff should be required to separately state and number them.</p>\n<p id=\"b905-6\">It follows that the order appealed from should be reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and the motion granted, with $10 costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
