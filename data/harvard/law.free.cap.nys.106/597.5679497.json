The plaintiff made a conditional bill of sale of the sheep to the defendant, retaining the title until the purchase price of $172.25 was paid. On the day that the purchase price became due the plaintiff demanded the possession of the sheep; the purchase price- not having been paid in full. There is no question that the plaintiff was entitled to the possession of the sheep, and had the right to sell them, under the provisions of the statute relating to conditional sales, if the defendant was in default in paying for them. It is contended on behalf of the defendant, however, that an absolute and unconditional offer was made on behalf of the defendant to pay for the sheep; but the plaintiff insisted upon talcing them, notwithstanding such offer, unless another debt was paid by the defendant, which the plaintiff claimed was owing to him. A verdict was directed for the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-13\">We think a question of fact was presented upon the evidence, which should have been submitted to the jury. It appears that each of the parties made claims against the other\u2014the defendant for certain matters for which he had presented an itemized statement to the plaintiff, and the plaintiff for hay, besides the purchase price of the sheep. The plaintiff claimed that the defendant refused to deliver the sheep without deducting from the purchase price the defendant\u2019s claim, and the defendant claimed that the plaintiff refused to take pay for the sheep unless the defendant also paid for the hay, and insisted upon holding the sheep for both claims. It is contended, however, on the part of the defendant, that eventually the defendant\u2019s wife (who seems to have represented him) stated that she would pay for the sheep, but not for the hay, and that the defendant refused to take pay for the sheep unless he was paid for the hay also, and insisted upon holding the sheep for both claims; and the evidence tends to support the defendant\u2019s contention in that regard. Whether true, or not, was a question of fact for the jury in the first instance. If true, it was sufficient, in connection with the other facts and circumstances, to have warranted a finding that the plaintiff waived a formal tender of the amount unpaii) upon the purchase price of the sheep. Murr v. Western Assurance Co., 50 App. Div. 4, 11, 64 N. Y. Supp. 12; Allen v. Corby, 59 App. Div. 1, 69 N. Y. Supp. 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>Upon the trial the defendant again offered to pay the balance due for the sheep. The plaintiff\u2019s counsel stated that the plaintiff would accept the offer, if the defendant paid the costs of the action, which the defendant refused. If there was a waiver of the tender, as has been stated, owing to the plaintiff\u2019s refusal to accept the unconditional offer of the defendant to pay for the sheep, and the plaintiff insisted upon taking and holding the sheep for his claim for the hay, in addition to that for the purchase price of the sheep, then the plaintiff was clearly in the wrong, and not justified in bringing an action to replevy the sheep, and so was not entitled to the .costs of the action.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-4\">The judgment and order appealed from should be- reversed, and a new trial granted, with costs to the appellant to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
