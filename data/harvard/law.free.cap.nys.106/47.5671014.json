The plaintiff was entitled to a commission only on finding and producing a purchaser. They did not produce the purchaser or even notify the defendants that they were negotiating with the purchaser. The defendants made the sale through another broker, agreeing to pay him a.commission, without knowing that the plaintiff had ever done anything to sell the land to the board of education.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-6\">Although the defendants were entitled to have the motion to direct a verdict in their favor granted, our practice is in such a condition that it appears that we cannot now grant the motion and end the case, but only reverse the judgment and order a new trial. This practice in many cases leads to much perjury on the new. trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-7\">The judgment and order should be reversed and a new trial granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-8\">Judgment and order reversed, and new trial granted, costs to abide the event. RICH, J., concurs. HIRSCHBERG, P. J., and WOODWARD and HOOKER, JJ., concur in result.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
