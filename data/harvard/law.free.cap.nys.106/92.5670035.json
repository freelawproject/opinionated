After making this proof, he attempted to show the number of men engaged in the work and the number of days each worked, and the number of brick and barrels of cement used, as the basis for his recovery. This evidence was objected to as immaterial and irrelevant, the- objections were sustained and exceptions to the rulings duly taken. He then asked to amend his complaint in such manner as to permit the admission of this evidence. This was denied, the trial court holding that such amendment would permit recovery for a cause of action different from the one alleged.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-10\">I think the evidence was admissible under the allegations of the complaint. The fact that, in order to establish the amount that the plaintiff was entitled to recover under his contract, it became necessary to prove the various items upon which his compensation was based, did not constitute a cause of action different from that alleged in the words:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b117-11\">\u201cHe furnished material consisting of brick, lime, cement, sand and other Building material, and furnished labor and' completed said buildings and appurtenances thereto pursuant to his agreement, at the agreed price and value of $21,061.85.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b117-12\">The only variance of the proof offered and excluded from the allegations of the complaint would be the possibility that the aggregate would not be the same, which would be an immaterial variance. The contract had been proven, with the exception of the amount which un<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>der its provisions the plaintiff was entitled to recover. The essential elements of furnishing the labor and materials required and completing the buildings in accordance with the plans furnished him by the defendants having been established, the aggregate amount of his recovery, although based upon 50 cents a day for each man employed, 50 cents a thousand for brick used, and 15 and 10 cents per barrel, respectively, for cement used, was yet within the allegation of his pleading, for the aggregate constituted the \u201cagreed price and value.\u201d The theory upon which the action was tried, viz., that the defendants had plans for the construction of the buildings which the plaintiff agreed to and did follow and comply with, that he furnished the necessary labor and materials and fully performed his contract, thereby becoming entitled to recover, as the amount agreed to be paid him,. sums amounting in the aggregate to the sum alleged, was within the averments of the complaint, and the exclusion of this evidence presents reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-4\">The judgment should be reversed and a new trial granted, costs to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
