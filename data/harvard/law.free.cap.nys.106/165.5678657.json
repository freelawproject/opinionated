The old pavement and the curb stones <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>had been torn up, and this was the condition at the corner of Cooper street where the plaintiff claims to have been hurt. The street was littered with material. The plaintiff testified in answer to her counsel: \u201cI knew the place was pulled up; all the stones and everything was pulled up; all the stones and the curbs were strewn upon the sidewalk.\u201d She came through the litter across Bushwiclc avenue to get back to her home in Cooper street. As she went to step up from the street to the sidewalk she stepped into the trench or line where the curb had set before it was taken up, and hurt herself. It was about six inches wide and a foot deep. Although she knew the curb had been taken up, and saw it lying along the sidewalk, she did not take the necessary care to keep out of the place where it had set. Being asked by her counsel if she took notice of where she was going and how she was stepping, she answered:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b190-5\">\u201cNo; I just walked careful, for I knew the place was torn up, you know. I didn\u2019t mind anything. Q. You said you walked carefully? A. A little carefully; yes.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b190-6\">This is all there is on that head. It falls far short of showing that she exercised the care required by law. Knowing that the street was pulled up and littered, she had to prove that she exercised extra examination and care. The rule that she might presume there were no holes or defects did not apply. The law required her literally to pick her steps. It was night, but the street was lighted with electricity. A verdict should have been directed for the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-7\">The judgment should be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-8\">Judgment and order reversed and new trial granted; costs to abide the event All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
