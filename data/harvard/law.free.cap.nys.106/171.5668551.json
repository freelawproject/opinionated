The action was commenced on the 4th day of December, 1905, by the service of the summons on the defendant. The payment by the trust company of the assessments was not made until the 23d day of December, 1905. The nonsuit was, therefore, properly granted, for the reason that the action was prematurely brought. The judgment, however, provides that the complaint should be dismissed \u201cupon the merits.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b195-15\">Because of this error, the judgment must be modified by striking out the words \u201cupon the merits,\u201d and, as thus modified, affirmed, without costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
