Prior to consolidation there was in the county of Richmond no particular salary attached to any particular grade or position; the matter of salary being one of yearly contract between each teacher and the local school authorities. Section 1086 of the Greater New York charter of 1897, which went into effect on January 1, 1898 (chapter 378, p. 392, Laws 1897), provided that all yearly school contracts, such as that which the plaintiff held, should be continued until the expiration of the yearly term named therein, and section 1091 continued the salaries as fixed and paid at the date of consolidation until new schedules should be adopted by the borough boards. Section 1117 provided that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1008-19\">\u201cAll superintendents * * * teachers * * * in the public school system of any part of the city of New York, as constituted by this act, shall con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"985\">*985</page-number>tinue to bold their respective positions, and to be entitled to such compensation as is now provided or may hereafter be provided by the various school boards, subject to the limitations of this act, and to reassignment or to removal for cause as may be provided by law.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1009-5\">After consolidation had been effected plaintiff continued to teach, as she had done before, a class which was exclusively a girls\u2019 graduating class, and the highest class in the school until June 1,1898. After that date her class was composed in part of girls about to graduate, known as pupils of the eighth grade, and in part of pupils of a lower, or seventh grade. This change in the composition of the class appears to have been the result of some rearrangement of classes, the nature of which is not explained. It does not appear that plaintiff was ever disciplined or \u201creassigned\u201d within the meaning of that word as used in section 1117, and it is clear that down to the date of her retirement the class she taught was, in part at least, a girls\u2019 graduating class. In 1900 the Legislature enacted the so-called \u201cDavis Act\u201d (chapter 751, p. 1605, Laws 1900), which went into effect on May 3, 1900. That act dealt in great detail with the subject of the salaries of teachers and other employ\u00e9s of the board of education, and by its fourth section (amending section 1091 of the charter of 1897) provided as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1009-6\">\u201cThe board of education shall have power to adopt by-laws fixing the salaries of the borough and associate superintendents and all members of the supervising and the teaching staff * * * and no female teacher of a girls\u201d graduating class * * * shall after ten years of service in said schools receive less than $1,440 per annum.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1009-7\">Pursuant to this act the board of education adopted a by-law which provided that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1009-8\">\u201cFemale teachers in the elementary schools appointed to classes in the 8th b. grade shall receive salaries in accordance with the following schedule, viz.: ' * * * Ten years $1,440.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1009-9\">It appears to be agreed that \u201cgirls\u2019 graduating classes\u201d are included within the phrase \u201cclasses in the 8th b. grade.\u201d At the time the so-called \u201cDavis Act\u201d went into effect plaintiff was receiving a salary of $1,320 per annum, and it is conceded that she continued to be paid, and to have accepted, salary at that rate down to the time of her retirement on February 1, 1901, and to have been paid and accepted a pension at the rate of half that sum, or $660 per annum, since the date of her retirement. She now claims that she was entitled to receive from the date of the passage of the Davis act to the date of her retirement salary at the rate of $1,440 per annum, and a pension since she retired at the rate of half that salary, or $720 per annum. Her judgment is for the difference between what she has received and what she now claims that she was entitled to receive. It is clear beyond contradiction that at the time the Greater New York Charter went into effect the plaintiff held a position in the educational system in the county of Richmond as teacher of a girls\u2019 graduating class, being the highest grade of \u2022 class in the elementary schools of that county. Such is the fact, and it is entirely unimportant that the place she held was not designated in terms as a \u201cposition\u201d in any act or by-law. Consolidation found her so occupied and holding such a position or place. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"986\">*986</page-number>Section 1117 of the charter then became operative. The object and effect of that section has been declared by the highest authority. It operated to permanently protect teachers, as well those employed before the passage of the act, as those appointed afterwards, in the tenure of their positions unless removed or reassigned for cause and in the manner provided by law. People ex rel. Callahan v. Board of Education, 174 N. Y. 169-174, 66 N. E. 674; Bogert v. Board of Education, 106 App. Div. 56, 94 N. Y. Supp. 180. The effect of that section, therefore, so far as concerned this plaintiff was to permanently secure her tenure of the position in which the charter found her, to-wit, that of a teacher of a girls\u2019 graduating class. Except for cause, the defendant had no power after January 1, 1898, to reduce her to a .lower position, and we do not consider that they should be held to have done so, or to have attempted to do so merely because her class was so reconstituted that, in addition to teaching girls about to graduate, she was called upon to teach others not so far advanced. By fair intendment, therefore, as well as by operation of law, she continued to be a teacher of a girls\u2019 graduating class, and was such on May 3, 1900, when chapter 751, p. 1605, Laws 1900, went into effect, and by the terms of that act she at once became entitled to receive the salary which she now claims. Since she had never been removed or reduced in rank, she is under no necessity to proceed by mandamus for reinstatement.</p>\n<p id=\"b1010-5\">The defendant insists that, by accepting and receipting for salary and pension at the lower rate, the plaintiff has waived the right to compensation at the higher rate. If her right to compensation rested upon contract, there would be force in this contention; but it does not. Her right to receive both the salary and the pension which she \u25a0now claims was definitely fixed by statute, and, when the compensation of a public employe is fixed by statute, it cannot be reduced by the superior officer under whom he or she is employed, and the fact that the employ\u00e9 for a time accepts the reduced compensation does not estop him or her from subsequently claiming the residue. Kehn v. State, 93 N. Y. 291; McCunney v. City of New York, 49 App. Div. 482, 58 N. Y. Supp. 138; Clark v. State, 142 N. Y. 101, 36 N. E. 817.</p>\n<p id=\"b1010-6\">The determination of the Appellate Term must be affirmed with costs. All concur, except INGRAHAM, J., who dissents.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
