The injunction issued is, however, too broad, and should have been modified by permitting the deposit of the number of shares claimed by plaintiff. By such a modification the plaintiff will be secured so far as concerns the specific relief which he asks, and other transfers of stock with which he is not concerned will not be indefinitely enjoined.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-18\">The injunction will therefore be modified, by providing that it shall remain effective unless and until Boyd shall deposit with the Windsor Trust Company 84,000 shares of the stock of the Palmer Mountain Tunnel &amp; Power Company, properly indorsed so as to be available to plaintiff in case he shall be successful in this action, said stock to remain so deposited until final judgment or the further order of this court, and, as so modified, will be affirmed, without costs. The appeal from the order denying the motion to resettle the injunction order will be dismissed, without costs. The motion to vacate or modify the injunction should have been granted to the extent above indicated. It must be reversed, and the motion so far granted as to modify the injunction as hereinbefore directed upon the appeal from the injunction order, also without costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-19\">The-orders may be settled on notice.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
