The order should be modified, however, by striking out the provision imposing a penalty for a failure to file the bill of particulars required by the order. If a bill of particulars as required should not be furnished* the plaintiff may then apply to the court for an order preventing the defendants from giving any evidence as to the items about which the bill of particulars was ordered; but, until there has been a default* this provision is improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-4\">It follows that the order appealed from must be modified, by striking out the last clause of the order, and, as modified, affirmed, without costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
