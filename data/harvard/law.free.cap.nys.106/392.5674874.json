Until these conditions are better, I must forbid him from going to court, as such duty would be at the risk of his life.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b417-8\">It seems to us that, while there had been some previous adjournments, they had all been caused by the defendant\u2019s serious illness, and that, under the circumstances presented, the. further adjournment asked for ought to have been granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-9\">The order appealed from therefore should be reversed, without costs in this court to either party, and the motion to open the inquest and let the defendant in to defend granted upon the payment of costs as taxed, and $10 motion costs; the judgment to stand as security.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
