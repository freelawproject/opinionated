It did -acquire the interest therein of three of the five children of Herbert Feavn, If title to the lot was in the said five children at that time. The said Herbert -Fearn died in 1892 leaving the said children as his only heirs at law. His <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>mother died In 1881 the owner of the said lot and other lots, and leaving him her sole heir. The second clause of her will is as follows: \u201cI direct that my real estate shall be sold by my trustee hereinafter named at such time or times as he may deem most beneficial to my estate, but at private sale .only and on the conditions hereinafter stated, and that said estate be converted into money.\u201d By the third clause she devised all of her real estate to Jerry A. Wemberg, \u201cin trust nevertheless for the purpose of letting or leasing any part or the whole of said property for no longer than one year at any one letting, and to receive the rents, issues and profits thereof and therefrom, to pay taxes, assessments, insurance premiums and such expenses as are necessary to protect and preserve the same, to pay the interest due or to become due on any and all mortgage liens on said property; from the surplus rents, if any there should be, to pay one-half of the principal of the mortgage, and the other half to Herbert Fearn, until the same shall be sold.\u201d The fourth clause confers on the said trustee a power to sell or mortgage all or any part of the real estate \u201cduring the continuance of this trust, and to execute any contract, deed, conveyance or mortgage sufficient to convey the title or encumber the property when my said son approves of the terms of the conveyance, and only then, such approval to be evidenced by his becoming a subscribing witness thereto.\u201d The corpus is left undisposed of by the will. No sale was made in Herbert Fearn\u2019s lifetime.

It cannot take place at all except by his consent. The corpus is left undisposed of by the will. The trust created is to collect the rents and pay expenses, and use one half the net income to pay off the mortgage on the land and pay the other half over to Herbert Eearn until the land should be sold by his consent. If he do not consent, the power of sale must end with his life. The trust must also end then, for it is only for his benefit, and also only an incident of the power of sale. The power of' sale does not survive for the purpose of a distribution, for the corpus is not disposed of or distributed by the will. If the will manifested an intention of the testator that there should be in the end, and at all events, a sale and distribution, then we would have a very different case; the power of sale would have to survive to save the intention and scheme. The cases of Barber v. Cary, 11 N. Y. 397, Kissam v. Dierkes, 49 N. Y. 602, and Gulick v. Griswold, 160 N. Y. 399, 54 N. E. 780, therefore apply. Section 154 of the real property law (Laws 1896, p. 583, c. 547) is not to be considered as it is not retroactive (Gulick v. Griswold, supra) ; and, besides, title was vested in the defendant before the said section was passed.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-8\">The case is one which a trial judge may consider difficult and extraordinary, and the extra allowance was properly granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>The judgment should be modified by reducing the amount of damages to two-fifths thereof, and the allowance proportionately.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-3\">Judgment modified by reducing the amount <em>oy </em>damages to two-fifths of the sum allowed, with a proportionate reduction of the extra allowance, and, as modified affirmed, without costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
