The only proof of service was a written admission, signed by the Superintendent of Insurance, of service \u201cof process * * * in behalf of James J. McKeever as administrator,\u201d etc. But this alleged admission of service was fatally defective, as it did not identify the process served. The complaint alleges that the defendant is a foreign corporation, but there is no allegation that it has an office in the city of New York, as it would have to have in order to give the Municipal Court jurisdiction (Municipal Court Act, Laws 1902, p. 1488, c. 580, \u00a7 1, subd. 18) ; nor is there any proof that it is an insurance corporation, or that it has \u201e executed and filed the written appointment provided for in section 30 of the insurance law (Laws 1892, p. 1945, c. 690).</p>\n<p id=\"b1066-16\">We do not assent to the proposition, argued by the appellant, that service of the summons on the Superintendent of Insurance at Albany would not give the court jurisdiction in any case, for not being service\" within the city, but think that such service would have to be deemed service within the city, in case the other jurisdictional facts were shown. In other words, said section 30 of the insurance law was intended to provide a way of obtaining personal service on a foreign in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1043\">*1043</page-number>surance corporation, and such service should be deemed to be made within the territorial jurisdiction of the court issuing the process. But this judgment must be reversed for failure to show the jurisdictional facts hereinbefore stated.</p>\n<p id=\"b1067-5\">Judgment of the Municipal Court reversed, and new trial ordered; costs to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
