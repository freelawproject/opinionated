His version of the casualty is as follows: He had moved a machine from one place to another on the floor in the defendant\u2019s shop. The machine was worked by a belt attached to shafting. It was necessary to join the belt, which had been cut, so as to adjust it to the machine in its changed position. He and Hille, the defendant\u2019s superintendent, were at the work. Hille told the plaintiff to get upon a platform four feet high. The belt was then hanging loose over the shafting. Hille told the plaintiff to hold one end of the belt while he held the other, in the work of determining the proper length of the belt preparatory to joining the ends thereof. The shafting had been and was in motion throughout this work. Hille jerked the bottom of the-belt so as to draw the plaintiff\u2019s arm around the shafting, and the plaintiff was thereby seriously injured.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-5\">The learned court charged the jury, under exception, \u201cAs a matter _ of law, under those conditions, Mr. Hille, concededly the superintendent, * * * was acting as the alter ego of the defendant,\u201d and Hille\u2019s negligence charged the defendant, if he (i. e., Hille) was negligent. I think that the exception was well taken. The employer\u2019s liability act casts liability on the employer for the negligence of his superintendent only when the negligent act is in the course of superintendence. Lowery v. Huntington Light &amp; Power Co., 121 App. Div. .245, 105 N. Y. Supp. 852, decided by this court July 23, 1907; Hope v. Scranton Sr Lehigh Coal Co., 120 App. Div. 593, 105 N. Y. Supp. 372, decided by this court June 28, 1907. The act of Hille was not one done in superintendence, and had no relation to his status as superintendent. Hille was engaged at the time in' the work of a fellow servant, and his act which caused the casualty was in the detail of the work of readjusting the belt. Foster v. International Paper Co., 183 N. Y., at page 50, 75 N. E., at page 934; Lowery v. Huntington Light &amp; Power Co., supra; Hope v. Scranton &amp; Lehigh Coal Co., supra; Meeker v. Remington &amp; Son Co., 53 App. Div. 592-598, 65 N.

J., not voting.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
