The defect complained of was a depression caused by the construction of a curb about 10 or 12 inches from the old curb, without sufficiently filling in the intervening space. The plaintiff was permitted to prove, over the specific objection that the evidence was irrelevant, that this space was filled in shortly after the accident. Such evidence in this -class of cases has too frequently been condemned to require any discussion or citation of authorities now. As the judgment must be reversed for said error, it would be profitless to discuss the merits at this time.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-8\">I advise that the judgment and order be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-9\">Judgment and order reversed and new trial granted.
