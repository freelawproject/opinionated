Spitzer v. Spitzer, 38 App. Div. 438, 56 N. Y. Supp. 470; Hubbard v. Housley, 43 App. Div. 129, 59 N. Y. Supp. 392, affirmed 160 N. Y. 688, 55 N. E. 1096; Staples v. Hawes, 39 App. Div. 548, 57 N. Y. Supp. 452. I think that the provision empowering the executors to -sell \u201cat such time within 5 years after my decease as they may be able to obtain the sum of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>$50,000 in the aggregate therefor\u201d is not merely advisory, but is'a limitation so that they have no authority to sell during that period for a less price. Fowler on Real Property Law of the State of New York (citing authorities) writes:,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b126-5\">\u201cWhile a peremptory power of sale does not per se suspend the power of alienation, a power to sell and distribute does not necessarily relieve a trust limitation, otherwise invalid, from the effect of suspending the power of alienation. So, if the execution of even a power of sale is, by any limitation, unduly postponed, such limitation violates the rule against a perpetuity, and is void, unless the power is of such a nature as to be presently extinguished or merged. Where the power may be released by a person entirely sui juris, it would seem not to create a perpetuity.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b126-6\">If the power of alienation was suspended for a term not measured by lives, then the provision is void. Brown v. Quintard, 177 N. Y. 75-82, 69 N. E. 225; McGuire v. McGuire, 80 App. Div. 63, 80 N. Y. Supp. 497. It is bad if at the time of the creation of the trust there was a possibility that there could be no sale for the period of five years. Nelson, C. J., in Hawley v. James, 16 Wend. 61-120, says:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b126-7\">\u201cNow, if in either aspect the limitation of the estate might suspend the power of alienation beyond the time allowed by the law, it will be impossible to sustain it, because the rule is well established that a limitation which by possibility may create such a suspension is void.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b126-8\">See, too, Amory v. Lord, 9 N. Y. 403, 415, citing Hawley v. James, supra; Herzog v. Title Guarantee &amp; Trust Co., 177 N. Y. 86, 99, 69 N. E. 283, 67 L. R. A. 146; Trowbridge v. Metcalf, 5 App. Div. 318, 39 N. Y. Supp. 241, affirmed Trowbridge v. Trowbridge, 158 N. Y. 682, 52 N. E. 1126. In Spitzer v. Spitzer, supra, this court, per Cullen, J., said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b126-9\">\u201cThe will directs that the executor shall sell, as soon as possible after the testator\u2019s death and within, two years from the admission of her will to probate, for the best price that can be realized, but for not less than $18,500 without the written consent of the testator\u2019s sons. It seems to us that this does not violate the statute against perpetuities. The trust is to continue until the time of sale. If the authority to sell was unqualifiedly limited by the provision that the executor should obtain the sum of $18,500 for the property, the trust would be illegal because it might be that the executor never could obtain that price.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b126-10\">See, too, Stewart v. Hamilton, 37 Hun, 19-21.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-11\">The learned Special Term was moved to pronounce the provision valid by the consideration that a price well within the fair market value of the thing to be sold is no more than is implied in all powers of sale, and there was no attempt to show that the realty could not fetch the price named within five years. But the fact that normally a voluntary vendor does not sell at a sacrifice, if in any way germane to the question before us, could indicate nothing more than that this testator thought that the sum which he named might be realized within the five years. And the implied restriction upon an agent or a trustee that he should not make a voluntary sale at a foolish price is quite' different from an express prohibition that he should sell only at a prescribed price. The validity of the provision, as I have shown, is not to be determined by probabilities or possibilities of a sale, but the possibility that there could not be a sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>I am of opinion that the power of sale cannot be defeated or annulled. A specified part of the proceeds of a sale is to be held by the executors in trust for the lifetime of the testator\u2019s son George. Hence there cannot be a present right in existence to dispose of the entire interest. Garvey v. McDevitt, 73 N. Y. 556. In addition, after the gifts to his children John and Sarah, and the making of the said trust for the life of George, any residue of the sale is to be distributed \u201camongst such Free Protestant Church and Evangelical Protestant Churches in sums not to exceed five hundred dollars to any one church, as my said executors or the majority of them then acting shall in their discretion deem most deserving and in need thereof, but no church shall be selected to receive any benefit under this provision of my will unless the same shall be a free church, where no charge is made or fee is required to be paid to occupy the pews or sittings therein during divine services.\u201d Now, I do not find that there is any religious denomination known or described even approximately as the \u201cFree Protestant Church.\u201d There is a religious body known as the \u201cEvangelical Church,\u201d but there is doubt whether the testator by the expression \u201cEvangelical\u201d intended any more definite designation than those churches which conformed to the principles of the gospel of Jesus Christ. Century Dictionary. It is to be noted that there is no territorial limitation whatever, but, for aught expressed, all churches within those terms may be selected by the executors. There is serious question under the rule of Read v. Williams, 125 N. Y. 560, 36 N. E. 730, 31 Am. St. Rep. 748, whether this power is not too indefinite. However this may be, this residue was not given to any church or churches which could be selected at the time of the death of the testator, for only after the sale was the residue to be given to such churches \u201cas my said executors or the majority of them then acting shall in their discretion deem most deserving and in need thereof.\u201d It seems clear that the executors cannot now exercise such a discretion which must regard the deserts and needs of particular churches, which at the time of the distribution may then show themselves worthy and free churches.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-9\">The scheme of the part of the will under consideration contemplated the creation of a fund which required the sale of the fealty specified. It is true that the power of sale was limited for a period by the provision in question, but at the expiry of that period the power of sale was imperative. All agree that the provision for accumulations meanwhile is bad. The question is whether the provisions are so articulated with the scheme that the scheme itself must fail. It we eliminate the void provisions as to the sale (that for accumulations is but incidental to it), we cut off a provision designed not to defer the scheme, but to secure a particular price. Whenever that price could be obtained, the scheme of distribution was to be carried out. It was not essential to the scheme that a particular price be obtained, inasmuch as there is no restriction as to price after the lapse of five years. Elimination of the void provision leaves intact both the imperative power of sale and the plan of distribution. If we uphold the scheme, aside from the void provisions, we but now make possible the plan the testator intended should become effective immediately within five years if the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>fixed price was realized, and, in any event, upon the lapse of that period. We write, then, no new will. We but possibly accelerate the operation of testator\u2019s dominant purpose. The disposition of the fund to be realized from a sale does not offend the law. The trust in $10,000 thereof is measured by the life of the son George. The other parts thereof are to be distributed outright, and the disposition of the residue, if any, may be sustained. Under the doctrine of Kalish v. Kalish, 166 N. Y. 368, 372, 59 N. E. 917, Haxtun v. Corse, 2 Barb. Ch. 506, and Van Vechten v. Van Veghten, 8 Paige, 104, I think that this should be the disposition of this case. My view constrains me to differ and to agree with the learned Special Term. First. I differ in that I think that the limitation of the power of sale for five years is bad. Second. I agree that the direction for the accumulation of the net rents and profits until the sale is bad. Third. I agree that, if the sale does not realize the sum of $30,000, the rents are given to the absolute distributees to the extent necessary to make the fund $30,000, and further I think that an excess of rents over that sum is applicable to the provision for the churches. Fourth. I agree that the one-third of that contribution which is directed to be held in trust for the life of George E. Woolley is void. Fifth. In other respects I agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-5\">I advise that the judgment, as thus modified, should be affirmed, with costs to all parties payable out of the estate. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
