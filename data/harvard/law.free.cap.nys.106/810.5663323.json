Reference to the order of December 22, 1906, shows that it contains no such direction. That order commands the plaintiff, and not the appellant, to proceed with \u25a0said action and to continue therein with all reasonable dispatch to -final judgment. There was no requirement in that order that the \u2022appellant should do anything, and nothing \u00e1ppears showing that he Fas in any respect violated it. The fact that he, as referee in partition, for a long time improperly withheld payment from the respondent of her distributive share of the moneys in his hands payable to her under the judgment, was sufficient to render him subject to a proper application to the court to compel compliance on his part with the judgment; but that fact is no justification for holding him as for a contempt in failing to comply with the order referred to, for he has not been shown guilty of any violation of that order.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-16\">The order should be reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and_ the motion granted, without costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
