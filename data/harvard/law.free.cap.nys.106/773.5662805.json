Subsequently the respondent went into bankruptcy, and his application for discharge was opposed by the appellant and refused by the United States court in bankruptcy. After such denial by the bankruptcy court the bankrupt filed a second petition upon the same debts, and\" thereafter made a second application for and received a discharge by the same court. It further appeared that the appellant was named in the schedules as a creditor in the second bankruptcy proceedings, but that his true residence was not stated in the schedules; it being stated as No. 9 Ferry street, New York City, while his residence was at St. George, S. I., where he had lived for ten years prior thereto, except that for a small portion of that period he lived at 42 West Ninety-Sixth street, borough of Manhattan, city of New York, and his place of business at the time the second petition in bankruptcy was filed, and at the time of the making of the schedules therein, was 81 Fulton street, borough of Manhattan, and that his name and address appeared in the city directory. The appellant had no personal knowledge of the second proceedings in bankruptcy, or of the application for a discharge thereunder, or of the subsequent motion to discharge these judgments. It appeared that notice of the motion to discharge the judgments was served upon one of the attorneys of record for appellant; but these attorneys ceased to represent appellant after the final judgment was entered, and he was represented in the first bankruptcy proceedings by another attorney in no wise connected with the attorneys of record, and it is not pretended that notice was given him, or that appellant was ever informed of the service of the notice upon his former attorneys. Upon the contrary, it appears affirmatively that he was not. Respondent knew that the appellant was no longer represented by the original attorneys of record, and that another attorney had successfully resisted his previous application for discharge in bankruptcy. No notice was giveh to the substituted attorney. This might easily have been done. While the respondent complied with the provisions of Code, \u00a7\u00a7 1268, yet the purpose of the statute was defeated because no actual notice was given. I think, therefore, that under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"775\">*775</page-number>the circumstances a proper exercise of discretion demanded that the default be opened.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-5\">\u25a0But this is not all. I am of the opinion that no proper notice of the second bankruptcy proceedings was given. The bankruptcy act (Act July 1, 1898, c. 541, \u00a7\u00a7 7, 58, 30 Stat. 548, 561 [U. S. Comp. St. 1901, pp. 3425, 3444), provides that the bankrupt must file \u201ca list of his creditors showing their residences, if known,\u201d and that notices must be sent to the creditors at \u201ctheir respective addresses as they appear in the list of creditors.\u201d Appellant\u2019s true address might easily have been ascertained by referring to the directory, and, while the purpose of the proceeding undoubtedly was to escape the pajunent of the judgments held by appellant, his address was erroneously given, and the discharge obtained without notice to the largest creditor, and the one who had successfully defeated respondent\u2019s former application for a discharge. In Columbia Bank v. Birkett, 174 N. Y. 112, 66 N. E. 652, 102 Am. St. Rep. 478, Judge Gray, writing for the court, said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b799-6\">\u201cI think it was intended that the decree discharging the voluntary bankrupt should be confined in its operations to the creditors who had been duly listed and who were enabled to receive the notices which the act provides for.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b799-7\">I think, within this rule, the appellant established a valid defense to the motion for the discharge of the judgments, and that his motion was improperly denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-8\">There is another reason why the default ought to have been opened. The judgments were against two defendants\u2014the respondent and one Taylor. There was no power in the court to discharge the judgments as against Taylor, but the county clerk was directed to cancel and discharge the judgments against both defendants. I think the order discharging the judgments was improperly granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-9\">The order from which this appeal is taken must therefore be reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and the motion granted. All concur, except HIRSCHBERG, P. J., not voting.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
