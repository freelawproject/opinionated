It was therefore not necessary for the plaintiff to show that the car that hurt him was the defendant\u2019s. That fact followed from the fact that the railroad tracks were the defendant\u2019s. If there was evidence of the cars of another company running over the defendant\u2019s tracks, the case might be different; but that fact is not to be presumed. The presumption is to the contrary, i. e., that the defendant\u2019s possession is exclusive, just as much as the presumption is that my possession of my house is exclusive. There is no presumption that I have let a floor or a room to any one. No other company could be running cars over the defendant\u2019s tracks except by its consent. Railroad Law, Laws 1890, p. 1113, c. 565, \u00a7 102. Its right and possession must at first have been exclusive, and the presumption is of continuance, not of change.
