That rule is most salutary, and its enforcement is necessary for the protection of the court, <em>to </em>prevent applications made to one judge after the same application has been made to and refused by another judge. The objection was seasonably taken by the plaintiff, and, as this rule was intended to be enforced, a violation of it without excuse justified the court below in vacating the order.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-4\">For this reason, the order appealed from must be affirmed, with $10 costs and disbursements. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
