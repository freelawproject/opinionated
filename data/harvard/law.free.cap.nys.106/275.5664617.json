The point is made that the order is mot appealable to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-7\">Sections 7 and 8 of the village law provide for an appeal from the decision of the supervisor to the County Court, and section 8 provides that the order of the County Court \u201cshall be final and conclusive.\u201d The supervisor decided, whether rightly or not, that the proposition did not comply with said chapter 414, p. 366, of. the Laws of 1897. This was the question which he was required to decide. Section 6 of the village law. The appellants claim that section 1357 of the Code of Civil Procedure authorizes this appeal, but it is to be noted that that section only .applies to an order \u201cmade by a court of record, possessing original jurisdiction, or a judge thereof, in a special proceeding, instituted in that court or before a judge thereof.\u201d This proceeding was instituted before the supervisor, and not in the County Court, or before a judge thereof. In the case of Village of Harrisville v. Lawrence, 66 Hun, 302, 21 N. Y. Supp. 62, relied upon by the appellants, the proceeding to review the election resulting in the order appealed from was instituted in the County Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-8\">But, if said section (1357) would otherwise have authorized an appeal to this court, we think it was plainly intended by the statute that there should be no such appeal. The words \u201cfinal and conclusive,\u201d as applied to orders like the one now before us, have been construed by the Court of Appeals to mean that there should be no appeal. Matter of Commissioners of Central Park, 50 N. Y. 493; New York Central Railroad Co. v. Marvin, 11 N. Y. 276; Matter of Canal and Walker Streets, 12 N. Y. 406; King v. City of New York, 36 N. Y. 182-187; Matter of D. &amp; H. C. Co., 69 N. Y. 209. This view is not affected by the decision in Matter of Daly, 189 N. Y. 34, 81 N. E. 560, because the court in that case did not decide that the words \u201cfinal and conclusive\u201d did not preclude the right to appeal, but that they had no application, for the reason that the first appraisal was set aside for the admission of improper evidence. The cases relied upon by the appellants are not in point, for the reason that the provision of the statute respecting appeals did not apply to the particular orders reviewed in those cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-9\">The appeal should be dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-10\">Appeal dismissed, with $10 costs and disbursements. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
