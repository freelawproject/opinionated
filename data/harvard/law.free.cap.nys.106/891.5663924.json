The purchaser was unable to pay for the lots and proceed with the construction of the buildings, and \u201cthe first tier of beams\u201d was never reached. It was a condition precedent to plaintiff\u2019s right to recover that the first tier of beams should be reached in process of construction (Turner v. Lane, 47 Misc. Rep. 387, 93 N. Y. Supp. 1083; Tooker v. Arnoux, 76: N. Y. 397); and, unless it be made to appear that the defendant was-in some way responsible for the failure of Schlosberg to proceed,, plaintiff cannot recover. We are unable to find any satisfactory evidence from which this inference can be drawn.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-11\">The judgment must be reversed, and a new trial ordered; costs to-abide the event. All concur, except HIRSCHBERG, P. J., not voting.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
