It is not necessary to allege that the employer expressly agreed to pay for these services, or to pay a precise sum. If she engaged the plaintiff in her service, or if he performed work at her request, the implication is that she was to pay therefor. She may never have agreed in terms to pay him, although the expectation to do so may be certain. In any event, in ordinary circumstances, the failure of the master to agree expressly to compensate his servant does not debar the latter from recovering what he has fairly earned.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-21\">It is urged that the action is to recover damages for breach of contract, and that it is necessary to allege nonpayment of the debt, as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"644\">*644</page-number>that constitutes the breach. The authorities sustain this contention. Lent et al. v. N. Y. &amp; M. R. Co., 130 N. Y. 504, 39 N. E. 988; Bacon v. Chapman, 85 App. Div. 309, 83 N. Y. Supp. 545; National Bank of Deposit v. Rogers, 166 N. Y. 380, 387, 59 N. E. 933. Let us examine the complaint further, and see if there is not a reasonable compliance with this rule. There is a second cause of action set out in the pleading. Under that number, but in an independent paragraph, the pleader alleges that during the period above mentioned (and each cause of action spans the same time) \u201ceach and every one of the sums stated in the foregoing causes of action became due and payable before the commencement of this action, and no payments have been made thereon, except,\u201d etc. The character of the alleged payment is then set forth, aggregating $366, and \u201cleaving a balance due plaintiff herein in said claim and account the sum of $3,434.\u201d The claim in the second cause of action is only $1,300, and it is obvious that the amount of the entire indebtedness claimed is ascertained by deducting the sum allowed in reduction of the entire demand.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-5\">Incorporating the allegation of nonpayment in the second paragraph \u25a0or count is not good pleading. It is a jumble which may create confusion, but the remedy for that defect is by motion. A fair interpretation of the whole pleading is that the allegation of nonpayment applies to both demands, and no one can be misled by the faulty arrangement of the allegations. The allegations, taken together, although inartificially placed, state a cause of action, and stand the test. Schlieder v. Dexter, 114 App. Div. 417, 99 N. Y. Supp. 1000.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-6\">In the second cause of action the plaintiff alleges \u201cthe entire contents of folio 1\u201d of the complaint. From the folioing contained in the record it is uncertain how much was included in this reference, and this method of pleading is not to be sanctioned; but the remedy for its cure is not by demurrer or dismissal at the trial, but by motion. Thompson v. Wittkop, 184 N. Y. 117, 76 N. E. 1081.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-7\">In the second cause of action it is alleged that the decedent \u201cbecame indebted\u201d to the plaintiff for $1,000 \u201cfor money had and received * * * from May 5, 1885, to December 3, 1905.\u201d It may be, within the authorities, this allegation is a mere conclusion of law. Sampson v. Grand Rapids School Co., 55 App. Div. 163, 66 N. Y. Supp. 815; Tate v. American Woolen Co., 114 App. Div. 106, 99 N. Y. Supp. 678. But, unless no cause of action is stated in the complaint, a dismissal for failure as to this one item will not be sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-8\">For a second item embodied in this paragraph the allegation is that Susan Anson \u201cbecame indebted unto this plaintiff for money paid out and expended for use and benefit of said Susan Anson and at her instance and request, and in the purchase of lumber, goods, wares, and merchandise, in the sum of $300.\u201d We think the origin of this indebtedness is sufficiently alleged, and, if the expenditure was made at the request of the intestate, liability to repay follows.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-9\">The complaint alleges, and the answer admits, that a-verified statement of the claim was presented to the defendant and rejected by him. The claim is .in the record. A bill of particulars, also in tfre record, was furnished to the defendant. The items which compose the plaintiff\u2019s claim are there set out, with the credits admitted in the complaint. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"645\">*645</page-number>The services claimed cover a period of 20 years, and would not, probably, be susceptible of elucidation by items. While the pleading is not to be commended, we think it does state a cause of action, and, in connection with the verified claim and bill of particulars, was sufficiently explicit to inform the defendant of the claim against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-5\">When the motion to dismiss was about to be granted, the plaintiff\u2019s counsel asked for leave to amend, if there was any informality in the <em>complaint; </em>but leave was denied. It seems quite clear that the defendant was not misled by the defects now urged; and the court, if it was satisfied the complaint was defective, should have allowed arc amendment, imposing such terms as it deemed equitable. National Bank of Deposit v. Rogers, 166 N. Y. 380, 387, 59 N. E. 922.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-6\">The judgment and order should be reversed, and a new trial ordered, with costs to the appellant to abide event. So ordered. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
