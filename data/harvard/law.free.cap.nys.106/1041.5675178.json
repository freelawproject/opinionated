I should have written \"\u201cbefore his father died,\u201d instead of \u201cbefore his father went to the \"hospital\u201d; and he was in the hospital 47 days. The result is that there was no time of possible access if the period of 280 days be taken (for there was no access during the 47 days the deceased was in the hospital) , and only 12 days if the period ofj 300 days be taken. During these 12 days the deceased was living in the household of the mother of the two tenants in common other than the appellant, as pointed out in my former opinion. The purport of her testimony was that the wife of the deceased never visited him there. But she says that she was not always at home, and could not tell how often she went out. Moreover she was testifying for her children, and to be classed as a biased witness. The burden was on the respondents to show incontrovertibly\u2014by \u201cirrefragable proof\u201d (Caujolle v. Ferrie, 23 N. Y. 108), i. e., so clearly and certainly as not to admit of denial, dispute or controversy (see \u201cIrrefragable,\u201d Century Dictionary)\u2014that such access did not take place, and this they did not do. It would be hazardous to say there was no access.</p>\n<p id=\"b1065-17\">The judgment should be reversed both on the law and the facts.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1065-18\">Judgment reversed on the law and the facts on reargument, and new trial granted; costs to abide the final award of costs. All concur.</blockquote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
