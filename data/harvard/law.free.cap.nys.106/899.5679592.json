Issue was joined on July 25, 1907, whereupon the plaintiff demurred to the answer. It does not appear that the issue of that demurrer has been tried. The defendant would plead by \u25a0supplemental answer that on August 20, 1907, letters patent were issued \u201cin connection with the night lamp manufactured by defendants.\u201d As this fact has come into existence subsequent to the former pleading, the procedure is correct. The leave granted in no way determines the rights of the parties. Nichols\u2019 New York Practice, 1058.</p>\n<p id=\"b924-13\">But the learned counsel for the appellant insists that the order is wrong because the moving papers are insufficient, in that the proposed pleading does not show that the allegation is material, and also in that the plea is frivolous. It is true the plea, if proven, cannot constitute a complete defense, if all the allegations of the complaint are established ; and it is possible that the plea may not be at all material. But, on the other hand, indefinite as the pleading is, it is possible that some of the acts of unfair competition alleged may be justified by the invention secured by the defendants. We cannot say, therefore, that the pleading is manifestly bad or frivolous. Upon such an application the court does not determine whether the fact pleaded is available upon a reading of the opposing affidavits. Reynolds v. \u00c6tna Life Ins. Co., 16 App. Div. 74, 44 N. Y. Supp. 691.</p>\n<p id=\"b924-14\">The order of the Special Term wras properly made, and it should be affirmed, with $10 costs and disbursements. Williams v. Hayes, 53 Hun, 630, 5 N. Y. Supp. 666; Mitchell v. Allen, 25 Hun, 543. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
