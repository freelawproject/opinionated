New York City Railway Company, 106 N. Y. Supp. 894 (decided herewith), except that the plaintiff is an infant and. that the clerk of the attorney of record for the plaintiff procured her to sign a writing authorizing said attorney to bring suit. She says that she did not understand the contents of the paper signed by her, and that she wishes the action discontinued. . Said clerk states that he was informed by the plaintiff that she was over <em>21 </em>years of age. Her reason for deceiving her attorney, if she understood that she was employing one, is not apparent. But,irrespective of that,\" we think the court should not compel an infant, for whom no guardian ad litem has been appointed, to prosecute an action which she wishes to discontinue.</p>\n<p id=\"b920-16\">The motion should be granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b920-17\">Order reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and motion granted, with $10 costs, payable by the attorney for the respondent All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
