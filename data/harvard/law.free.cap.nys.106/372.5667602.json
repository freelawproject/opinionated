The only reference in the notice of lien to the labor performed or the materials furnished was as follows :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-22\">\u201c(4) The labor performed and the materials furnished was the moving of a building from the north side of Pacific street and placing the same upon the premises hereinafter described and designated, and the agreed price thereof Is three thousand four-hundred and sixty dollars.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b397-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>It is to be observed that the only claim stated was for the moving of the building and the placing of it upon other premises. The com- \u2018 plaint was somewhat broader, claiming for the same moving and placing upon other premises, and, in addition, for the completing of the erection thereof. The amount claimed to be due by the plaintiff and mentioned in the decision is $3,557.20, $3,000 of which, however, is for the building itself; the balance being for something else. It is evident that the notice of lien is not valid to support a claim for the price of the building itself. It is held that the statement in the notice of lien' as provided for in subdivision 4 of section 9 of the lien law (Laws 1897, p. 518, c. 418) must specifically and definitely state the labor performed or to be performed, or the materials furnished or to be furnished. Toop v. Smith, 181 N. Y. 283, 73 N. E. 1113; McKinney v. White, 15 App. Div. 423, 44 N. Y. Supp. 561. This has not been done in this case as far as the building is concerned.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-5\">Judgment should be reversed, and new trial granted, costs to abide the event.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-6\">All concur, except WOODWARD and GAYNOR, JJ., who dissent.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
