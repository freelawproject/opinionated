The sidewalk was composed of flag stones, one of which, at the point where the plaintiff was injured, had been partly broken by the driving of wagons across the sidewalk at that point. The view of the evidence most favorable to the plaintiff establishes that the hole was between 3 and 4 inches deep, 12 inches long, and about 6 inches wide. The condition had existed between 6 and 14 years. There was no evidence of any prior accident <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>at that place, save the testimony of one of the defendant\u2019s witnesses that he himself once tripped over that place.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"history\" id=\"b190-15\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>Appeal from Trial Term, Richmond County.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b190-16\">Action by Margaret Powers against the city of New York.

In Butler v. Village of Oxford, 186 N. Y. 444, 79 N. E. 712, the leading cases in this state dealing with irregularities in sidewalks of substantially the size of the one which caused the plaintiff\u2019s injury were carefully reviewed. It seems generally (1) that an irregularity of this size, which is in the form of a depression, is such as not reasonably to suggest danger; but, (2) on the other hand, where the depression is of this or greater depth, and the hole is so small or of such a character that a pedestrian\u2019s foot is liable to become fastened in the hole or caught under its edge, or where the irregularity is an abrupt upward obstruction above the general level of an even sidewalk, whose presence would not in the ordinary use of the street be anticipated, a question of fact is presented as to the defendant\u2019s negligence (see cases cited in the Butler Case).</p>\n<p id=\"b191-9\">In our opinion, the hole which caused the plaintiff\u2019s injury falls in the first classification. The judgment should be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-10\">Judgment and order reversed and new trial granted; costs to abide the event All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
