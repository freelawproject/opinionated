At the time plaintiff gave his transfer to the conductor, he held out his hand to receive another. The conductor muttered something, not heard by plaintiff, and passed on through the car; but, on his return, plaintiff orally demanded a transfer, which was refused. The defense was that plaintiff had not complied with defendant\u2019s rule, requiring passengers to demand transfers at the time of payment of fare, which rule was posted in the car. Judgment for plaintiff, and defendant appeals. Affirmed.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b402-11\">Argued before HIRSCHBERG, P.

This question was decided in favor of the plaintiff. I am of opinion that the decision upon the facts was justified by the. evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-15\">This being so, the question of law presented in behalf of the appellant as to the reasonableness of the rule requiring the request for the transfer to be made at the time of paying the fare is not involved in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-16\">The judgment of the Municipal Court should therefore be affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
