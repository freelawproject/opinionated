KELLOGG, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AHv\">In this action to enjoin defendant from obstructing a right of way across his premises upon the trial the plaintiffs stated that they \u201cdid not claim any public right of way nor any personal right of way on behalf of the plaintiffs, but only for a right of way appurtenant to the plaintiffs\u2019 land.\u201d Thereupon the court held the complaint insufficient, for the reason that it did not describe the lands to which it was claimed the right of way was appurtenant. In all other respects thie complaint is concededly sufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-11\">The complaint showed that the right of way described came up to and bordered upon the plaintiffs\u2019 \u201cPalmer one hundred acre lot,\u201d and that it was a convenient and necessary means of communication between and across the lands of the plaintiffs in said town, and for that reason was a suitable appurtenance to said lands. The naming of the plaintiffs\u2019 Palmer 100-acre lot, and their other lands in said town, is a sufficient description of the lands to which said way is appurtenant to enable the plaintiffs to maintain their action when the objection is raised for the first time upon the trial. The fact that a complaint is indefinite and uncertain do-es not justify its dismissal. The Code of Civil Procedure (section 546) has provided a remedy to cure such a defect.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-12\">The judgment should therefore tie reversed and a'new trial granted, with costs to the appellant to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
