No complaint in such action has ever been filed or served, and the defendants therein did not own the land at the time of such filing, having conveyed the same on May 16, 1904, to the defendant; and the deed was recorded next day. The lis pendens says the action is \u201cfor the enforcement of sections 100, 103, 103, 109, 99, 136 of the tenement house act, and the removal of violations of the same\u201d; and to recover against the said defendants \u201cthe penalty incurred by such violations and the costs of this action or proceeding.\u201d These sections prescribe how sinks shall be constructed, for the removal of privy vaults, for the whitewashing of cellar walls, the repair of roofs and for receptacles for ashes and garbage.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-5\">That the water closets were in the yard instead of the house, or that there were other defects or lack of improvements or repairs, was no defect of title. The contract was to purchase the house just as it was, and it did not matter how defective or tumble down it might be.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-6\">The lis pendens was no encumbrance. It is given only the \u201csame force and effect as the notice of pendency of action provided for in the Code of Civil Procedure\u201d (Tenement House Act, Laws 1903, p. 435, c. 179, \u00a7 130), and it has none unless the complaint be filed with it as the Code requires (section 1670; Weeks v. Tomes, 16 Hun, 349; Albro v. Blume, 5 App. Div. 309, 39 N. Y. Supp. 315). And no lien could be got on the land under it in the suit in which it was filed, for the defendants therein did not own the land when the suit was brought.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-7\">The plaintiff not only refused to take title for no reason, but neglected to bring this suit for nearly a year and a half, during which time the defendant spent $4,000 in improving his house. The plaintiff is entitled to no relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-8\">The judgment should- be reversed on both the law and the facts. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
