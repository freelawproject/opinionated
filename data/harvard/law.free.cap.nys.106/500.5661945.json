They having failed to comply with that order, the defendants moved at Special Term to punish them for contempt. The order was granted and they were adjudged guilty of contempt, but were permitted to purge themselves therefrom by depositing such money as directed, with interest thereon at the rate of <em>2V&lt;\u00a1 </em>per cent. The defendants appeal from that part of the order fixing the rate of interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-7\">The term \u201cwith interest,\u201d appearing in the order of this court, meant legal interest, which is 6 per cent, per annum. The Special Term had no right to fix a lesser rate, or one which was earned by the money when in the hands of the city chamberlain. The plaintiffs have had possession of the money, and presumably the use of it. When ordered to restore it, with interest, it was their duty to do so, with interest at the legal rate.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-8\">The order appealed from should be modified, by striking out the provision \"with <em>2y2 </em>per cent, interest,\u201d and inserting in place thereof \u201cwith interest at the rate of 6 per cent.,\u201d and, as so modified, affirmed, with $10 costs and disbursements to the appellants.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
