The defendant claims that the policy of fire insurance sued upon was void ab initio, under the clause in it that it should be void if the insured had any other contract of insurance, \u201cwhether valid or not,\u201d on the property insured,.unless otherwise provided by an agreement in writing indorsed on or added to the policy. There was no such agreement. The plaintiff had a policy on the property in another company.' That his name was erroneously stated therein as Sabito Roumani did not make it invalid, but it mattered not if it did. He testified, however, that he told the broker who solicited the policy of .the prior insurance, and that the latter said it was void. It was error to submit to the jury on this evidence whether there was a waiver by the defendant of the requirement of the policy in respect of other insurance. The broker, who was not a regular agent of the defendant, much less its general agent, but a mere soliciting broker for companies generally, was not able to waive such requirement; nor could it be waived except in the manner prescribed by the policy. Baumgartel v. Providence Ins. Co., 136 N. Y. 547, 32 N. E. 990, and cases there cited. This matter of other insurance is not trivial but grave.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-7\">The defendant did not plead a breach of the said provision of the policy as a defense, which was necessary to enable it to raise that issue, but the plaintiff needlessly introduced and insisted on litigating the question on the trial and must abide by the result.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-8\">The judgment should be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-9\">Judgment reversed, and new trial granted, costs to abide the event. JENKS and MILLER, JJ., concur. HIRSCHBERG, P. J., dissents in memorandum, with whom WOODWARD, J., concurs.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b88-10\">HIRSCHBERG, P. J.</author>\n<p id=\"Ago\">I dissent. As I understand the case, the plaintiff is willing to \u201cabide by the result.\u201d On the other hand, I see no reason why the defendant should have a second trial of an issue not raised by its answer, and which issue cannot be retried without an amendment of the pleading.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
