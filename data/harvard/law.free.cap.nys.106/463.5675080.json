While upon the record we would have been better satisfied if the verdict had been for the defendant, and would not have interfered if the learned trial justice had set aside the verdict as against the weight of evidence, we do not think that the evidence preponderates so strongly in favor of the defendant as to justify us in granting a new trial upon that ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-7\">We think, however, that the verdict is excessive. The recovery under section 1904 of the Code of Civil Procedure was limited to a fair and just compensation for the pecuniary injuries resulting from the decedent\u2019s death to the person or persons for whose benefit the action is brought, viz., the next of kin of the decedent. The decedent was unmarried, leaving a mother, a resident of Ireland, his next of kin; and it was only the damage sustained by the mother of the decedent, caused by his death, for which the defendant was liable. The evidence of what the decedent had paid towards the support of his mother was quite indefinite, and the jury evidently were under the impression that they could award compensation to the decedent\u2019s sisters.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-8\">Our conclusion is that the recovery should not exceed $2,500, and the judgment and order will therefore be reversed, and a new trial ordered, with costs to the appellant to abide the event, unless the plaintiff stipulates to reduce the recovery to that amount, in which case the judgment, as so modified, and the order appealed from, will be affirmed, without costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
