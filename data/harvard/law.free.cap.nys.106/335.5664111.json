The only excuse offered by the plaintiff\u2019s attorney is that his client had settled and compromised the claim, and, indeed, the answer, verified on the 2d day of March, 1904, alleges compromise of the claim and the execution and delivery by the defendant of a general release.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-5\">It is suggested that, in spite of the fact that the plaintiff\u2019s attorney has taken no steps in the action since the joinder of issue and made no move for the purpose of enforcing his lien, the case ought to be kept upon the calendar and treated as a live issue, solely for the attorney\u2019s protection. There seems to be no good reason for this. The attorney\u2019s rights, if he had any, accrued upon the compromise and settlement of which he was advised by the answer served. The facts do not differ essentially from those passed upon by the learned Appellate Division in the Second Department in Russo v. Darmstadt, 116 App. Div. 887, 102 N. Y. Supp. 209; and for the reasons there stated the order appealed from should be reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and the motion granted, with $10 costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
