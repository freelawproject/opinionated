The court, on motion of the defendants, has made an order requiring the plaintiffs to amend their complaint \u201cso as to allege upon what grounds plaintiffs claim they were damaged in the sum of $125 by reason of the defendants\u2019 failure to perform on their part the contract referred to in said complaint, and allege whether such damages are based upon the difference between the market price at the time and place of delivery and the contract price, or whether such damages are based upon the difference between th\u00bb contract price of said goods and the amount realized upon a resale thereof, and, if sold, whether the whole or part of the said goods were sold, or whether the damages are based upon and a recovery for the entire contract price of said goods.\" From this order the plaintiffs appeal.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"history\" id=\"b804-11\">Appeal from Special Term, Chenango County.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b804-12\">Action by Morris Friedman and another against Isaac Denousky and another.

Code Civ. Proc. \u00a7 546; Dumar v. Witherbee, Sherman &amp; Co., 88 App. Div. 181, 84 N<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"781\">*781</page-number>Y. Supp. 669. An inspection of this pleading reveals no uncertainty or indefiniteness, and its meaning and application is clearly apparent. Indeed, there is no substantial criticism of it, except in respect to the question of damages. The allegations are that the defendants entered into an agreement with the plaintiffs for the purchase of a specified number and kind of bags and a stated number of pounds of light copper at agreed prices stated in the complaint, to be delivered on a day and place named, and to be paid for on <em>delivery; </em>that at the time and place named the plaintiffs delivered such goods to the defendants and \u2022demanded payment therefor; that the defendants refused to receive and accept the same, and refused to pay the plaintiffs the agreed price therefor; and that the defendants failed to perform the contract upon their part, by reason of which the plaintiffs suffered damage in the sum of $125. The court on the trial would have no difficulty in applying the correct rule of damages, if the plaintiffs prove such a breach \u25a0of contract as they allege, without any amplification or amendment of the complaint. We think the order was inadvertently granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-5\">The order should be reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, the motion denied, with $10 costs, and the defendants granted leave to answer within 20 days upon the payment of such costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
