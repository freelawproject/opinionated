It may be gathered from such affidavit that it is a suit for an accounting. It states that the plaintiff had an oral agreement with the defendant to get purchasers of real estate owned or controlled by it, the plaintiff to be paid a percentage of the net profit the defendant should realize on the real estate thus sold, and that many sales were made by the plaintiff. No examination is necessary to frame a complaint for an accounting. If the defendant be under the duty to account to the plaintiff, and refuses to do so, as the plaintiff\u2019s affidavit alleges, then all that the plaintiff needs to do is to frame a bare and lean complaint showing that he is entitled to an accounting. Then the course is to obtain an interlocutory judgment that the defendant file an account. The practice following that is equally familiar to the profession. The plaintiff wants to get the account before he serves a complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-8\">The order should be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-9\">Order reversed, with $10 costs and flisbursements, and motion granted, with costs.
