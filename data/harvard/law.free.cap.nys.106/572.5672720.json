As the court at Special Term has decided that such a trial was practicable, and has therefore denied the motion for a reference, we do not think that upon these papers we should reverse that determination. The affirmance of this order, however, is without prejudice to the court at Trial Term, when the case should be brought on for trial, ordering the issues to be tried before a referee, if it should then appear that a trial by a jury was impracticable.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-8\">The order appealed from is therefore- affirmed, with $10 costs and disbursements of the appeal to the party in whose favor final judgment is awarded. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
