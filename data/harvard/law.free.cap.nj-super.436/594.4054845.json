Defendants further appeal from the final judgment filed on September 12, 2012, awarding plaintiffs damages of $42,381, which included an award of attorney\u2019s fees. On appeal, defendants raise several arguments maintaining entry of summary judgment was erroneous. We disagree and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-11\">These are the facts viewed most favorably toward defendants. <em>Brill v. Guardian Life Ins. Co. of Am., </em>142 <em>N.J. </em>520, 529-30, 666 A.2d 146 (1995). Plaintiffs filed a declaratory judgment action (BER-L-8638-11) seeking a determination that defendants were responsible to pay various costs and expenses resulting from defendants\u2019 failure to comply with the terms of the parties\u2019 settlement agreement <em>(Globe </em>II). Prior to addressing the issues presented, we must provide background information regarding the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>settlement in the underlying action and events supporting plaintiffs\u2019 declaratory judgment complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-6\">The underlying action (BER-C-203-08) was initiated by Globe, as represented by Margolis, which alleged breach of contract and fraud against defendants and two others <em>(Globe I). </em>That action was settled by a six-page written settlement agreement. Among the terms of settlement was paragraph 2, which stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b641-7\">That ILYA and JULIA shall jointly pay to GLOBE the amount of SEVENTY-FIVE THOUSAND ($75,000.00) DOLLARS, by certified or attorney trust account check payable to \u201cThe Margolis Law Firm LLC, as attorneys for Globe Motor Company\u201d and delivered to The Margolis Law Firm LLC not later than 1:00 pm on Friday, October 2, 2009 <em>TIME BEING EXPRESSLY MADE OF THE ESSENCE.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b641-8\">The settlement agreement also provided that \u201c[i]n the event ILYA does not pay, for any reason or no reason, any portion of the settlement amount, then in such event, JULIA shall pay the entire SEVENTY-FIVE THOUSAND ($75,000.00) DOLLARS of the settlement amount, as required by the provisions of paragraph # 2 hereof.\u201d Upon \u201cfull payment\u201d plaintiffs would enter a stipulation dismissing the litigation and the agreement contained a full mutual release of claims between the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-9\">By October 2009, Margolis received two certified bank checks totaling $75,000. More specifically, one check was for $12,000 and the other for $63,000, each made payable to \u201cThe Margolis Law Firm, LLC as Attorneys for Globe Motor Company.\u201d The larger check contained a notation stating: \u201cRemitter Mike Povolotsky.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"ags-dedup-0\">Margolis accepted the certified checks as defendants\u2019 payment under the terms of the settlement agreement. A stipulation of dismissal, with prejudice, was later filed concluding <em>Globe I.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b641-10\">Almost one year later, Globe and Margolis were served with a complaint filed by Brian Leonard, the designated Chapter 7 Trustee assigned to supervise the bankruptcy case initiated by the debtor Auto Point, Limited (Auto Point).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Leonard, on behalf of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>the debtor\u2019s estate, filed an adversary proceeding to recover $75,000 alleged to have been fraudulently transferred from the debtor\u2019s assets and paid to Margolis and Globe. Leonard asserted Auto Point \u201cwas not a client of, and owed no obligations to\u201d Margolis or Globe, and the debtor had \u201creceived less than a reasonably equivalent value in exchange for the [transfers.\u201d Furthermore, Leonard\u2019s complaint maintained the transfers were made when Auto Point was insolvent or the debtor became insolvent as a result of the transfers. Leonard alleged the transfers were voidable under various provisions of the Bankruptcy Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-5\">Plaintiffs learned Povolotsky, defendants\u2019 friend and business associate, owned Auto Point. The trustee had determined the monies transmitted to Margolis to satisfy defendants\u2019 obligations under the settlement agreement were taken from Auto Point\u2019s funds.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-6\">Margolis and Globe hired separate bankruptcy counsel. A settlement resolving Leonard\u2019s claims was reached, requiring payment of $22,500. Additionally, they incurred attorney\u2019s fees and costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-7\">When the bankruptcy action was terminated, plaintiffs filed <em>Globe II, </em>seeking to recover damages sustained in defending and settling the adversary proceeding. Plaintiffs alleged defendants had breached the terms of settlement in the underlying action by \u201cfail[ing] to tender the amount due under the Settlement free and clear from claims of others and not subject to surrender____\u201d Plaintiffs alleged defendants\u2019 breach caused plaintiffs to suffer damages equivalent to the amounts paid to Leonard to settle the trustee\u2019s claims, along with attendant attorney\u2019s fees and costs, both in the bankruptcy action and the declaratory judgment matter. The <em>Globe II </em>complaint also alleged unjust enrichment, breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing, fraud, and also sought indemnification from Julia.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-10\">The parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment. Plaintiffs\u2019 counsel restated the facts regarding the <em>Globe I </em>litigation, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>settlement agreement, checks received, Minnesota bankruptcy proceedings, terms of settlement of the adversary proceeding, and attorney\u2019s fee expense incurred. Globe\u2019s vice president affirmed these facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-6\">In support of defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment, Ilya certified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b643-7\">4. In order to resolve that litigation, I entered into a Settlement Agreement, wherein Globe was to receive $75,000.00, payable to The Margolis Law Firm LLC, as Attorneys for Globe Motor Company.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b643-8\">5. This settlement was made as a business decision by all parties.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b643-9\">6. Pursuant to the Settlement Agreement and Release, I was to pay the sum of $75,000.00 and my former wife, Julia Igdalev, was a guarantor of said payment and in addition, entered into a confession of judgment if those payments were not made.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b643-10\">7. At approximately the same time the Settlement Agreement was executed, my New Jersey bank accounts had been restrained due to allegations in a criminal action against me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b643-11\">8. Prior to the restraint of my funds, in the New Jersey bank accounts, I had a business and personal relationship with an individual named Michael Povolotsky.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b643-12\">9. Michael Povolotsky was a buyer and seller of cars in Minnesota, and also operated a business in Minnesota called \u201cAuto Point Limited.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b643-13\">10. About the same time the Settlement Agreement was reached, Michael Povo-lotsky, individually, was holding more than $75,000.00 of money owed to me from prior dealings.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b643-14\">11. I requested Michael Povolotsky to make checks payable to The Margolis Law Firm LLC, in the total amount of $75,000.00 in settlement of this case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b643-15\">Ilya averred neither he nor Julia \u201cwere asked, nor agreed to indemnify or hold [plaintiffs] harmless from any claims[,]\u201d stating \u201c[t]here was absolutely no provision in the Settlement Agreement ... that the funds were to come from my wife or myself, individually, or [from] any specific payor.\u201d Maintaining he acted \u201cin good faith,\u201d Ilya insisted he made the payment required under the settlement agreement, and based on the release, neither he nor Julia had a further obligation to plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-16\">Julia too filed a certification adopting as true and correct all statements made by Ilya. \u201cIn addition, [she noted] all payments were timely made and accepted without protest by [p]laintiff[s], who had dismissed the ... action with prejudice.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b644-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>Following a lengthy oral argument, the Law Division judge denied defendants\u2019 and granted plaintiffs\u2019 motion for summary judgment. The judge found defendants had materially breached the settlement agreement because the monies tendered were determined to have been transferred from the debtor Auto Point, without consideration, and were legally subject to recovery. The judge therefore concluded Ilya did not pay the $75,000 as required by the settlement agreement. He entered orders memorializing this decision on May 11, 2012. Subsequent motions were filed regarding recovery of attorney\u2019s fees and costs. Final judgment was entered on September 12, 2012. Defendants\u2019 appeal ensued.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-5\">We review the trial court\u2019s summary judgment order de novo, applying the same standard that governs the trial court. <em>W.J.A. v. D.A., </em>210 <em>N.J. </em>229, 237, 43 A.3d 1148 (2012); <em>Lapidoth v.

Pursuant to <em>Rule </em>4:46, we \u201cconsider whether the competent evidential materials presented, when viewed in the light most favorable to the non-moving party, are sufficient to permit a rational factfinder to resolve the alleged disputed issue in favor of the non-moving party.\u201d <em>Brill, supra, </em>142 <em>N.J. </em>at 540, 666 A.2d 146. \u201c[Wjhen the evidence is so one-sided that one party must prevail as a matter of law, the trial court should not hesitate to grant summary judgment.\u201d <em>Ibid, </em>(citation and internal quotation marks omitted). If no genuine factual dispute exists, we must decide whether the trial court\u2019s ruling on the law, to which we owe no deference, was correct. <em>W.J.A., supra, </em>210 <em>N.J. </em>at 237-38, 43 A.3d 1148.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-6\">Also implicated in our review are principles governing the enforcement of the parties\u2019 terms of settlement. \u201cPublic policy favors the settlement of disputes. Settlement spares the parties the risk of an adverse outcome and the time and expense\u2014 both monetary and emotional\u2014of protracted litigation.\u201d <em>Willingboro Mall, Ltd. v. 240/242 Franklin Ave., L.L.C., </em>215 <em>N.J. </em>242, 253-54, 71 A.3d 888 (2013). <em>See also Herrera v.

Kelsey, </em>200 <em>N.J. </em>507, 512, 984 <em>A.2d </em>872 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b645-7\">When examining the terms of a settlement agreement, we are guided by the rules of contract construction. <em>Brundage, supra, </em>195 <em>N.J. </em>at 601, 951 A.2d 947. <em>See also Thompson v. City of Atl. City, </em>190 <em>N.J. </em>359, 379, 921 A.2d 427 (2007). \u201cThe polestar of contract construction is to discover the intention of the parties as revealed by the language used by them.\u201d <em>Karl\u2019s Sales &amp; Serv., Inc. v. Gimbel Bros., Inc., </em>249 <em>N.J.Super. </em>487, 492, 592 A.2d 647 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>127 <em>N.J. </em>548, 606 A.2d 362 (1991). In interpreting a contract, the focus is on \u201cthe intention of the parties <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>to the contract as revealed by the language used, taken as an entirety; and, in the quest for the intention, the situation of the parties, the attendant circumstances, and the objects they were thereby striving to attain____\u201d <em>Lederman v. Prudential Life Ins. Co. of Am., Inc., </em>385 <em>N.J.Super. </em>324, 339, 897 A.2d 373 (App.Div.) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted), <em>certif. denied, </em>188 <em>N.J. </em>353, 907 A.2d 1013 (2006). In that regard, the court may not re-write a contract or grant a better deal than that for which the parties expressly bargained. <em>Solondz v. Kornmehl, </em>317 <em>N.J.Super. </em>16, 21, 721 A.2d 16 (App.Div.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b646-6\">Recognizing the parties\u2019 autonomy in resolving their disputes, \u201c[i]t follows that any action which would have the effect of vitiating the provisions of a particular settlement agreement and the concomitant effect of undermining public confidence in the settlement process in general, should not be countenanced.\u201d <em>Dep\u2019t of Pub. Advocate, Div. of Rate Counsel v. N.J. Bd. of Pub. Utils., </em>206 <em>N.J.Super. </em>523, 528, 503 A.2d 331 (App.Div.1985). With these principles in mind, we consider defendants\u2019 arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-7\">On appeal, defendants contend the judge incorrectly granted summary judgment to plaintiffs, asserting the only \u201ccompetent evidential material ]\u201d before the court was Ilya\u2019s certification stating the $75,000 transferred by Povolotsky was Ilya\u2019s money. Therefore, the funds could not belong to the debtor, Auto Point. Because defendants challenged plaintiffs\u2019 claim regarding the ownership of the money used to satisfy the obligations under the settlement agreement, defendants argue material factual disputes obviated entry of summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-8\">To support this contention, defendants claim \u201call parties were aware of the restraint on Ilya[\u2019s] ... funds in Bergen County.\u201d Defendants\u2019 brief purports to quote from Ilya\u2019s certification filed in support of defendants\u2019 motion and in opposition to plaintiffs\u2019 motion for summary judgment. However, the certification as filed contains no statement placing plaintiffs on notice of the restraint of defendants\u2019 funds or the need to rely on Povolotsky. In fact, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>the recitals recounted and relied on by defendants in their brief materially differ from the actual facts of record.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-6\">Nevertheless, accepting as true Ilya\u2019s statement Povolotsky was \u201cholding ... money owed ... from prior dealings\u201d does not prove funds sent to plaintiffs by Povolotsky were Ilya\u2019s or refute that the money transferred to plaintiffs actually belonged to Auto Point. Defendants\u2019 contrary suggestion made to create a dispute of material facts is illusory. <em>See Shelcusky v. Garjulio, </em>172 <em>N.J. </em>185, 200-01, 797 A.2d 138 (2002) (\u201cThe very object of the summary judgment procedure then is to separate real issues from issues about which there is no serious dispute.\u201d). Quite simply, the assertion that Povolotsky held Ilya\u2019s money does not mean he sent Ilya\u2019s money.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b647-7\">Also, defendants mistakenly contend that absent a judgment from the Bankruptcy Court determining the funds actually were Auto Point\u2019s must mean they were Ilya\u2019s funds in Povolotsky\u2019s possession. That Povolotsky held Ilya\u2019s money creates no dispute of a material fact, which should subject plaintiffs to the burden of a trial. Merely because Povolotsky held Ilya\u2019s money does not establish he used those funds when making payment to plaintiffs. Indeed, Ilya asserts no personal knowledge establishing his money was actually transferred; at its best, defendants\u2019 suggestion in this regard is merely supposition, which is insufficient to defeat summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-8\">The record, viewed most favorable to defendants, shows only that after Ilya asked his friend and business associate to satisfy the settlement obligation with money owed to him, Povolotsky did <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>so using assets of his company, Auto Point. Ilya does not maintain Auto Point owed him money.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-5\">Auto Point\u2019s ownership of the funds is evident from the bankruptcy pleadings. Leonard is a fiduciary appointed by the United States Bankruptcy Court to oversee the debtor\u2019s estate. <em>See </em>11 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 321 to \u00a7 323 (stating eligibility and general duty of bankruptcy trustee). After examining the debtor\u2019s books and records, Leonard filed the adversary proceeding to recover money he found was taken from Auto Point\u2019s account and transferred to plaintiffs. There is no dispute regarding the amount transferred, which matched the sums delivered to plaintiffs or that the checks as issued were made payable to Margolis as attorney for Globe. Further, there is no evidence Auto Point owed a debt or obligation to plaintiffs or Ilya. Because the transfer was without consideration, it is subject to recovery. <em>See </em>11 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 548 (allowing trustee to avoid fraudulent transfers made by a debtor within the four-year limitations period). The settlement of the adversary action represented a compromise by the parties with respect to the contested and disputed issues, accepting the trustee\u2019s evidence, along with each side\u2019s assessment of the cost and expense in proceeding to trial.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b649-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>We conclude plaintiffs cannot be faulted for settling rather than trying the adversary proceeding. <em>See Frank Stamato &amp; Co. v. Lodi, </em>4 <em>N.J. </em>14, 21, 71 A.2d 336 (1950) (citing <em>Ramsey v. Perth Amboy Shipbuilding Eng\u2019g Co., </em>72 <em>N.J. Eq. </em>165, 65 A. 461 (Ch.1906), <em>aff'd. </em>73 <em>N.J. Eq. </em>742, 70 A. 1101 (E. &amp; A.1908)). (\u201c[I]t is well established that a party who has been injured by a breach of contract must make reasonable efforts to mitigate his damages!.]\u201d). To suggest plaintiffs were required to complete a trial and obtain a judicial determination is specious. <em>Pinto, supra, </em>200 <em>N.J. </em>at 594, 985 A.2d 1239.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-5\">We additionally reject defendants\u2019 argument suggesting the motion judge\u2019s determination was erroneously based on his finding Ilya was not credible. The judge\u2019s cited comments were not a determination of contested facts; rather, the statements represent an assessment that the asserted facts do not create a material dispute. As the Court held in <em>Shelcusky:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b649-6\">The determination that an offsetting affidavit creates only a sham factual dispute is squarely within the trial court\u2019s authority at the summary judgment stage, when the court is required to evaluate, analyze, and sift evidence to determine whether the evidential materials, when viewed in the light most favorable to the opposing party, would permit a rational factfinder to resolve the issue in favor of the opposing party. That rule does not intrude on the function of the jury because it does not require the trial court to determine credibility, or to determine the relative weight of conflicting evidence. We are confident that trial courts have the ability to distinguish sham affidavits from affidavits that raise a genuine issue of material fact.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b649-7\"><em>[Shelcusky, supra, </em>172 <em>N.J. </em>at 201, 797 A.2d 138.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A1g\">Defendants next assert they fully complied with the settlement terms as drafted and were innocent because they lacked knowl<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>edge of any wrongdoing by their friend Povolotsky. Essentially, defendants believe their presentation of certified checks that were accepted by plaintiffs, who thereafter filed a full release and stipulation of dismissal, ends our inquiry. Additionally, defendants argue plaintiffs could have rejected the tender of the funds drawn on a Minnesota Bank or after noticing one check contained Povolotsky\u2019s name as remitter. We examine these points.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b650-5\">Evaluating the relative innocence of the parties, when deciding who bears the burden of Povolotsky\u2019s actions, we conclude the manner and methods chosen were controlled by defendants and accomplished at their direction. Therefore, the consequences of Povolotsky\u2019s unseemly conduct falls to them rather than plaintiffs. Povolotsky\u2019s failure equates to defendants\u2019 failure to perform and strikes at the very heart of the settlement agreement, defeating its purpose and representing a material breach of its terms. <em>See Restatement (Second) Contracts </em>\u00a7 241 comment a (1981) (discussing a material breach of contract).</p>\n<p id=\"b650-6\">Defendants\u2019 contention that they complied with the letter of the settlement agreement when they tendered a cashier\u2019s and a bank check totaling $75,000 is legally unfounded. An essential element of the agreement was that plaintiffs received the agreed-upon amount. Because legal claims attached to the money tendered, which were not immediately apparent, payment was illusory.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-7\">The constrained construction of the contractual obligations asserted by defendants completely ignores the reality that legal defenses attached to the funds, which prevented plaintiffs\u2019 retention. By accepting the compromise set forth in the settlement agreement, plaintiffs sought to end the litigation with defendants and had no intention of becoming embroiled in a new suit. When the monies used to satisfy defendants\u2019 obligation were not free of the claims of others, the essence of the settlement agreement was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>breached. Although Ilya delivered payment, the funds used did not belong to Povolotsky and could not be transferred to another. Therefore, the trustee\u2019s recovery of $22,500 results in defendants not paying plaintiffs the agreed sum of $75,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-6\">We also find defendants\u2019 argument that plaintiffs should have been suspect of the out-of-state checks highly disingenuous. After all, defendants commissioned Povolotsky to act. Plaintiffs had no reason to doubt the efficacy of the negotiable instruments, <em>N.J.S.A </em>12A:3-104(c), or know the money tendered actually belonged to Auto Point. The mode of payment specified in the settlement agreement was intended to provide some security that receipt of the designated instruments evidenced existence of the funds. <em>See Merchants\u2019 Nat'l Bank v. State Bank, </em>77 <em>U.S. </em>604, 648 (10 <em>Wall.), </em>19 <em>L.Ed. </em>1008, 1019 (1870) (acknowledging \u201c[t]he practice of certifying checks has grown out of the business needs of the country,\u201d and noting \u201c[t]hey enable the holder to keep or convey the amount specified with safety.

It would seem to follow, therefore, that the more the holder knows about the underlying transaction, and particularly the more he [or she] controls or participates or becomes involved in it, the less he [or she] fits the role of a good faith purchaser for value; the closer his [or her] relationship to the underlying agreement which is the source of the note, the less need there is for giving him [or her] the tension-free rights considered necessary in a fast-moving, credit-extending commercial world.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b652-7\"><em>[Unico v.

Perhaps it was unforeseen that Povolotsky would be a scoundrel, but we cannot ignore Ilya controlled that process. Therefore, he may not be relieved of the responsibility to tender full payment if the process he chose was flawed.

In addition, they place the burden of proof on defendants as to the ownership of the funds transferred. For the reasons that follow, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-8\">These are the facts viewed most favorably toward defendants. <em>Ibid. </em>On October 1, 2009, Globe reached a settlement agreement with defendants Ilya and Julia Igdalev in an underlying dispute <em>(Globe </em>I), requiring that defendants jointly pay Globe $75,000 by certified or attorney trust account check payable to Margolis, Globe\u2019s counsel in that matter and co-plaintiff here, and that payment would be delivered to Margolis by October 2, 2009. The terms also provided that if Ilya failed to timely deliver the cheeks, Julia would have to pay the entire amount in the same manner, as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"611\">*611</page-number>guarantor. The parties agreed a stipulation of dismissal would be filed \u201c[u]pon full payment in accordance with th[e] [a]greement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b655-6\">Within days of reaching the settlement, defendants presented two cashier\u2019s checks totaling the full obligation, both made payable to Margolis on Globe\u2019s behalf. One of them explicitly named a Mike Povolotsky, rather than either of defendants, as the remitter, and the other specified no remitter. For reasons unexplained, plaintiffs did not file the stipulation of dismissal until March 23, 2010.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-7\">In April 2010, Auto Point filed a petition for Chapter 7 Bankruptcy. On February 24, 2011, sixteen months after defendants paid the $75,000 and eleven months after the stipulation of dismissal was filed, the bankruptcy trustee, Brian Leonard, filed a complaint (adversary proceeding) against plaintiffs in Minnesota bankruptcy court, claiming that Auto Point \u201cmade two payments to [Margolis and Globe] on October 1, 2009, in the amount of $12,000.00 and $63,000.00 for a total of $75,000.00. The payments were made from [Auto Point\u2019s] assets\u201d and \u201cAuto Point was not a client of, and owed no obligations to, The Margolis Law Firm, LLC. The Debtor did not owe any obligations to Globe Motor Company.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b655-8\">The bankruptcy court admitted Margolis pro hac vice, but both Margolis and Globe retained separate local counsel. Leonard reached a settlement with Globe and Margolis for $22,500, which amounted to thirty percent of the $75,000 he originally demanded. Both Globe and Margolis also each paid $4000 in counsel fees to local Minnesota counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-9\">Plaintiffs thereafter initiated the present action <em>(Globe II) </em>against defendants, asserting defendants breached the settlement agreement and release because the bankruptcy proceedings in Minnesota effectively negated the settlement payment, along with claims for breach of an implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, fraud, unjust enrichment, and indemnification. Plaintiffs subsequently moved for summary judgment and defendants cross-moved for summary judgment. The court granted plaintiffs\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"612\">*612</page-number>motion and entered judgment in favor of plaintiffs for $22,000, the exact amount plaintiffs paid to resolve the adversary proceeding. The court also entered an order awarding counsel fees to plaintiffs, allocated as follows: $19,000 in counsel fees with $8,000 and $2,000 applied to the Minnesota bankruptcy action and $9,000 for prosecution of the present action.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-5\">In granting summary judgment, the motion judge found incredible Ilya\u2019s certification that the funds used to purchase the two checks belonged to or were owed to Ilya,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> noting that defendants never went to Minnesota to challenge the bankruptcy trustee\u2019s position that the checks were assets of the debtor. The court also found there were no genuinely disputed issues of fact as to whether defendants breached the settlement agreement. The court expressed: \u201cThey were supposed to pay $75,000. The Court finds the $75,000 wasn\u2019t paid. Start from the initial agreement. This isn\u2019t a novation. It\u2019s not an assignment. It\u2019s none of that. They guaranteed they will be paid $75,000, and they weren\u2019t paid $75,000.\u201d The present appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-6\">Our review of a trial court\u2019s grant or denial of a motion for summary judgment is de novo. <em>Agurto v.

D'Amato, </em>305 <em>N.J.Super. </em>109, 114-15, 701 A.2d 970 (App.Div.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b657-5\">Every theory of liability plaintiffs assert presumes the funds they had to return to the bankruptcy estate were legitimately subject to return, that is, that the transactions were legitimately avoidable, but this is only so if the funds actually belonged to Auto Point. 11 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 548(a). The majority accepts as true for purposes of summary judgment that Povolotsky was holding funds owed to Ilya, but maintains it was \u201cevident from the bankruptcy pleadings\u201d that the funds Povolotsky actually sent were drawn from accounts owned by Auto Point. <em>Ante </em>at 604, 95 A.3d at 797. Because Auto Point never owed Ilya any money, at least as the majority interprets Ilya\u2019s certification, the money Povolotsky sent could not have been Ilya\u2019s and must have belonged to Auto Point. <em>Ante </em>at 603-04, 95 A.3d at 796-97.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-6\">However, the only evidence plaintiffs have thus far presented that the money even originated from Auto Point\u2019s accounts is an untested allegation in a complaint from another matter. The majority may treat that allegation as established fact, but neither of the checks in the record names Auto Point as the remitter, one explicitly names Povolotsky personally, and the other bears no name for the remitter. Ilya certified that Povolotsky, not Auto Point as the majority itself points out, was to send him the money. Plaintiffs may well have settled the bankruptcy matter in good <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"614\">*614</page-number>faith, in light of the trustee\u2019s evidence, but they have not shared any of that evidence here, save the checks, which reveal no connection to Auto Point on their face. One may certainly reasonably infer from the bankruptcy complaint, as the majority does here, that the reason the trustee\u2019s investigation turned up these particular transactions is that the money at some point had been drawn from Auto Point\u2019s accounts. But that inference is not favorable to defendants, and it is disputed by the balance of the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-5\">Ilya certified that he and Povolotsky had a business relationship, that Povolotsky operated Auto Point, that Povolotsky \u201cwas holding more than $75,000.00 of money owed to [him] from prior dealings,\u201d and that he requested Povolotsky send the cheeks to Margolis. One may reasonably infer from those circumstances that the funds Povolotsky used to buy the checks were those owed to Ilya. Moreover, even if the funds were drawn from Auto Point\u2019s accounts, an unfavorable inference not permitted on summary judgment, Ilya never specified, notwithstanding the majority\u2019s assertion to the contrary, who owed him the money, only that Povolotsky was the one who was holding it. Given that Ilya claimed the money was owed from prior business dealings, it would not be unreasonable to infer that the money was owed by Auto Point, Povolotsky\u2019s business.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Finally, even if we draw the contrary inference, again, not one permitted on summary judgment, that the money was owed personally by Povolotsky, it would not be inconceivable that Povolotsky, whom the majority, after all, characterizes as a \u201cscoundrel,\u201d <em>ante </em>at 609, 95 A.3d at 800, might have intermingled his own funds with those of his corporation. Of course, one could also reasonably conclude, as the majority does, that Povolotsky personally owed money to Ilya, and that Ilya asked him to use <em>that </em>money to buy the checks, but that he used Auto Point\u2019s funds instead. One could even decline to credit Ilya <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"615\">*615</page-number>at all and conclude that neither Povolotsky nor Auto Point ever owed him any money in the first place.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-6\">The point to all of this is that these are all reasonable inferences, but not all of them inexorably lead to the ultimate conclusion the majority reaches, namely that the funds were Auto Point\u2019s, not Ilya\u2019s. Because the facts here are not so one-sided as to demand that conclusion, the task of weighing them must be left to the trier of fact. <em>See Gilhooley v. Cnty. of Union, </em>164 <em>N.J. </em>533, 545, 753 A.2d 1137 (2000) (stating that \u201cit was not the court\u2019s function to weigh the evidence and determine the outcome but only to decide if a material dispute of fact existed\u201d and that \u201c[o]nly when the evidence is utterly one-sided may a judge decide that party should prevail as a matter of law\u201d (citing <em>Brill, supra, </em>142 <em>N.J. </em>at 540, 666 A.2d 146)). Our task, for summary judgment purposes, is to accept the inferences favorable to defendants that may reasonably be drawn from Ilya\u2019s certification, which clearly raise a genuine dispute as to a central material fact in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-7\">The trial court should not have rejected Ilya\u2019s certification on credibility grounds, <em>see D\u2019Amato, supra, </em>305 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 114-15, 701 A.2d 970 (explaining that credibility issues must always be reserved for the trier of fact), and, at that, merely because defendants failed to participate in a proceeding to which they had never been made a party. The case on which the majority relies, <em>Shelcusky, supra, </em>172 <em>N.J. </em>at 199-202, 797 A.2d 138, is not to the contrary. It authorizes use of the sham affidavit doctrine on summary judgment to reject an affidavit that contradicts the affiant\u2019s own prior statements or position so as to invent a dispute of material fact. <em>Ibid. </em>That was not the case here, and the trial court never recognized it as such, but explicitly made a credibility evaluation. The judgment must be reversed for that reason alone.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-8\">Moreover, plaintiffs\u2019 breach of contract claim should have been dismissed. Margolis could not pursue such a claim, because it was never a party to the settlement agreement. <em>Parkway Ins. Co. v. N.J. Neck &amp; Back, </em>330 <em>N.J.Super. </em>172, 186-87, 748 A.2d 1221 (Law Div.1998). Globe could do so, but, for the following reasons, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number>the record was sufficient to establish as a matter of law that defendants complied with the explicit terms of the agreement, contrary to plaintiffs\u2019 allegations.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-4\">It is well settled that the \u201c \u2018settlement of litigation ranks high in our public policy.\u2019 \u201d <em>Brundage, supra, </em>195 <em>N.J. </em>at 601, 951 A.2d 947 (quoting <em>Jannarone v.

This strong public policy is based upon \u201c\u2018the notion that the parties to a dispute are in the best position to determine how to resolve a contested matter in a way which is least disadvantageous to everyone.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ibid, </em>(quoting <em>Peskin v. Peskin, </em>271 <em>N.J.Super. </em>261, 275, 638 A.2d 849 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>137 <em>N.J. </em>165, 644 A.2d 613 (1994)). Thus, courts give effect to the terms of a settlement wherever possible and honor them \u201c\u2018absent compelling circumstances.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ibid, </em>(quoting <em>Nolan v. Lee Ho, </em>120 <em>N.J. </em>465, 472, 577 A.2d 143 (1990)).</p>\n<p id=\"b660-5\">Settlement agreements are generally governed by principles of contract law. <em>Thompson, supra, </em>190 <em>N.J. </em>at 379, 921 A.2d 427. Therefore, they may be entered freely and enforced like all other contracts. <em>Pascarella, supra, </em>190 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 124-25, 462 A.2d 186. In interpreting a contract, the focus is on \u201c \u2018the intention of the parties to the contract as revealed by the language used, taken as an entirety; and, in the quest for the intention, the situation of the parties, the attendant circumstances, and the objects they were thereby striving to attain are necessarily to be regarded.\u2019 \u201d <em>Lederman, supra, </em>385 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 339, 897 A.2d 373 (quoting <em>Biovail Corp. Int\u2019l v. Hoechst Aktiengesellschaft, </em>49 F.Supp.2d 750, 774 (D.N.J.1999)). \u201c\u2018[CJourts should interpret a contract considering the objective intent manifested in the language of the contract in light of the circumstances surrounding the transaction.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 340, 897 A.2d 373 (quoting <em>Biovail Corp., supra, </em>49 F.Supp.2d at 774) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b660-6\">Significantly, our Supreme Court has held that \u201cthe legal effect of a release on other parties should be determined by the intent of the parties to the release, with due consideration being given to whether the compensation paid was fully adequate.\u201d <em>Cartel Capital Corp. v. Fireco of N.J., </em>81 <em>N.J. </em>548, 559 [410 A.2d 674] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>(1980). Similarly, we have observed that \u201ca release of a defendant will release him only in respect of those claims by those parties as are actually or intended to be encompassed thereby.\u201d <em>Goncalvez v. Patuto, </em>188 <em>N.J.Super. </em>620, 629 [458 A.2d 146] (App.Div.1983). \u201c[A] release is merely a form of contract and the general rules that apply to contract interpretation apply to releases.\u201d <em>Domanske v.

Essex Cnty. Improvement Auth., </em>404 <em>N.J.Super. </em>514, 528, 962 A.2d 591 (App.Div.2009). The touchstone for interpretation is the parties\u2019 shared intent in reaching the agreement, <em>Pacifico v. Pacifico, </em>190 <em>N.J. </em>258, 266, 920 A.2d 73 (2007), and, so long as that intent is evident from the contract\u2019s clear, unambiguous terms, the agreement will be enforced as written. <em>Karl\u2019s Sales, supra, </em>249 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 493, 592 A.2d 647.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-7\">To the extent any ambiguity exists, that is, to the extent that a contractual term is susceptible of more than one reasonable interpretation, <em>Powell v. Alemaz, Inc., </em>335 <em>N.J.Super. </em>33, 44, 760 A.2d 1141 (App.Div.2000), a court may discern the parties\u2019 intent from evidence bearing on the circumstances of the agreement\u2019s formation, <em>Conway v. 287 Corporate Ctr. Assocs., </em>187 <em>N.J. </em>259, 269, 901 A.2d 341 (2006), and of the parties\u2019 behavior in carrying out its terms, <em>Savarese v. Corcoran, </em>311 <em>N.J.Super. </em>240, 248, 709 A.2d 829 (Ch.Div.1997), <em>aff'd, </em>311 <em>N.J.Super. </em>182, 709 A.2d 799 (App.Div.1998). The required factual inquiry to resolve any such ambiguity typically precludes summary judgment unless the evidence is so one-sided as to compel judgment as a matter of law for one party or the other. <em>Great Atl. &amp; Pac. Tea Co., Inc. v. Checchio, </em>335 <em>N.J.Super. </em>495, 502, 762 A.2d 1057 (App.Div.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b661-8\">The agreement here plainly provided that defendants would have to timely pay the settlement amount by certified or attorney trust account check, that Julia would guarantee the obligation if payment were not made in that manner, and that only \u201c[u]pon full payment in accordance\u201d with the terms of the agreement, would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number>the stipulation of dismissal be filed. The parties do not dispute that defendants timely presented two cashier\u2019s checks totaling the full amount of their settlement obligation and that plaintiffs filed the stipulation of dismissal. The checks were honored, and the funds were neither counterfeit nor stolen.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-5\">Ordinarily, cashier\u2019s checks are the functional equivalent to cash, <em>Parks v. Commerce Bank, </em>377 <em>N.J.Super. </em>378, 380, 872 A.2d 1116 (App.Div.2005), and \u201c[ujnless otherwise agreed, if a certified check, cashier\u2019s check, or teller\u2019s check is taken for an obligation, the obligation is discharged to the same extent that discharge would result if an amount of money equal to the amount of the instrument were taken in payment of the obligation.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>12A:3-310(a). Moreover, Margolis accepted the checks notwithstanding that one clearly listed someone other than defendants as the remitter, and Globe filed the stipulation of dismissal, confirming its understanding that defendants had satisfied the terms of the agreement. <em>See Savarese, supra, </em>311 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 248, 709 A.2d 829 (intent of parties may be discerned from their behavior in carrying out the agreement). In other words, defendants satisfied those terms no matter whose funds were used to pay the settlement. Consequently, the primary dispute here, ownership of the funds, is not one of material fact with regard to this particular theory of liability, and defendants should have been granted summary judgment on the breach of contract claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-6\">Nor, for that matter, may plaintiffs pursue their indemnification claim specifically against Julia as guarantor. The settlement agreement explicitly provided that Julia\u2019s obligation in that capacity was only triggered insofar as Ilya failed to timely deliver payment by certified or attorney trust account check. Because he discharged that obligation, Julia may no longer be called upon to satisfy the terms of the settlement agreement as guarantor. <em>See Ctr. 48 Ltd. P\u2019ship v. May Dep\u2019t Stores Co., </em>355 <em>N.J.Super. </em>390, 405, 810 A.2d 610 (App.Div.2002) (explaining that a \u201cguarantor is not bound beyond the strict terms of its promise and its obligation cannot be extended by implication\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b663-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"619\">*619</page-number>That said, both defendants may still have liability here. The trier of fact could find, for example, that defendants arranged the transfer knowing that the funds would likely be subject to recovery in an impending bankruptcy with the intention that Globe thereby unknowingly risk losing the benefit of the agreement. In that case, defendants could be liable for breach of an implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, <em>Sons of Thunder, Inc. v. Borden, Inc., </em>148 <em>N.J. </em>396, 420, 690 A.2d 575 (1997), despite their compliance with the express terms of the settlement agreement, <em>Wilson v. Amerada Hess Corp., </em>168 <em>N.J. </em>236, 244, 773 A.2d 1121 (2001).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> If it is found, based upon any additional evidence presented, defendants knowingly misrepresented to Globe there would be no such risk, with the intention that Globe reasonably rely on that misrepresentation in order to agree to the settlement, defendants could be liable for fraud. <em>Gennari v. Weichert Co. Realtors, </em>148 <em>N.J. 582, </em>610, 691 A.2d 350 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b663-6\">Moreover, even in the absence of bad faith or fraud on defendants\u2019 part, there remains a common-law claim for indemnification. Ilya was undisputedly the one who arranged the transfers, and both defendants were beneficiaries of those transfers insofar as they satisfied their settlement obligations. If the evidence establishes the transfers were fraudulent and plaintiffs accepted them in good faith, plaintiffs could equitably call at least upon Ilya for indemnification, particularly under the peculiar circumstances of this case. <em>See Ramos v. Browning Ferris Indus. of S. Jersey, Inc., </em>103 <em>N.J. </em>177, 190, 510 A.2d 1152 (1986) (noting that \u201cone who in good faith and at the direction of another commits a tort is allowed indemnity against the person who caused him to act\u201d); <em>see also Promaulayko v. Johns Manville Sales Corp., </em>116 <em>N.J. </em>505, 511, 562 A.2d 202 (1989) (explaining common-law indemnity as an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"620\">*620</page-number>equitable doctrine). Alternatively, defendants could be held Hable for unjust enrichment to the extent that they received the benefit of the transfers, and the trial court concludes that it would be inequitable to permit them to keep that benefit without remunerating plaintiffs. <em>Callano v. Oakwood Park Homes Corp., </em>91 <em>N.J.Super. 105, </em>108-09, 219 A.2d 332 (App.Div.1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b664-4\">Plaintiffs have advanced all of these claims. Whether any would prove successful in a trial, of course, would depend on whether the funds were actually subject to recovery in the bankruptcy action. Further, to the extent any of the theories of liability advanced here sound in equity, recovery would be premised upon plaintiffs\u2019 good faith and the reasonableness of their settlement with the bankruptcy trustee. Worthy of note in this regard is that MargoHs appears to have had significant basis upon which to avoid liabiHty in the adversary proceeding as a \u201cmere conduit\u201d of the funds to its dient, rather than as an \u201cinitial transferee\u201d Hable to the estate under the bankruptcy code, <em>Gropper v. Unitrac, S.A. (In re Fabric Buys of Jericho, Inc.), </em>33 <em>B.R. </em>334, 336-37 (Bankr.S.D.N.Y.1983), even if, as the case may be here, it kept its fee and remitted only the balance to Globe, <em>Kirschenbaum v. Leeds Morelli &amp; Brown P.C. (In re Robert Plan of N.Y. Corp.), </em>456 <em>B.R. </em>150, 159-60 (Bankr.E.D.N.Y.2011). For reasons not apparent in the record, it did not pursue this defense in the adversary proceeding. Consideration of its failure to do so, along with the weighing of any equities, would be relevant to any award of attorney\u2019s fees to it, as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-5\">In sum, I dissent, as the judgment in plaintiffs\u2019 favor should be reversed, and the matter remanded for dismissal of plaintiffs\u2019 breach of contract claim, as well as their indemnification claim against JuHa as guarantor, and for further proceedings on their remaining claims.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b656-7\"> While the majority is correct that defense counsel\u2019s quotation of that certification in his brief differs from the copy of the certification in the record, counsel may well have been quoting from a different certification filed in a related bankruptcy matter involving Auto Point that was mentioned during oral argument. Moreover, plaintiffs' counsel never disputed that plaintiffs had been aware of Ilya\u2019s financial circumstances, notwithstanding that both defense counsel and the court referenced this fact during oral argument.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b658-6\"> In that case, the transfer may yet have been avoidable, 11 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 547(b)-(c), but the record is not yet sufficient to resolve that issue, and the trustee never pleaded that ground for relief.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b663-7\"> To be sure, this course of conduct would also constitute a breach of contract, <em>1266 Apartment Corp. v. New Horizon Deli, Inc., </em>368 <em>N.J.Super. </em>456, 461, 847 A.2d 9 (App.Div.2004), in the sense that the breach is of a covenant implied <em>in </em>the contract, <em>Wilson, supra, </em>168 <em>N.J. </em>at 244, 773 A.2d 1121. But our courts also recognize breach of the implied covenant as a separate cause of action, <em>see id. </em>at 240, 244, 773 A.2d 1121, and plaintiffs pleaded it as such here.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
