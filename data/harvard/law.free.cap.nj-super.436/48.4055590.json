At his plea hearing, petitioner acknowledged he and another agreed to make a monetary campaign contribution to one municipal official on April 19, 1999, and to two other municipal officials on April 20, 1999, to secure their opposition to a municipal resolution. This illicit agreement also included petitioner\u2019s promise to make additional campaign contributions once the municipal officials voted against the resolution. At sentencing, the conspiracy conviction was merged into the convictions on the three other crimes, and petitioner was sentenced to concurrent three-year probationary terms conditioned upon a thirty-day stay in the county jail; community service, fines and other penalties were also imposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-7\">On November 15, 2012, petitioner filed this action, seeking expungement of records relating to the 2001 judgment of conviction. The State objected and, following argument, the trial judge granted the application for reasons set forth in an oral decision. In appealing, the State argues that the judge erred in granting expungement because \u201cpetitioner was convicted of three separate crimes committed on two separate dates.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b94-8\">The expungement of criminal records is available only if authorized by legislation. There is no constitutional or common law right to the expungement of records relating to a criminal conviction.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The order under review was based solely on the trial judge\u2019s interpretation of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:52-2(a), which states, in pertinent part, that a person\u2019s criminal records may be expunged when that person</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b95-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>has been convicted of <em>a crime </em>under the laws of this State and ... <em>has not been convicted, of any prior or subsequent crime </em>..., after the expiration of a period of 10 years____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b95-7\">[Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b95-8\">The statute imposes other requirements, but we need not consider them because, in seeking reversal, the State argues only that petitioner was convicted of \u201ccrimes\u201d not \u201ca crime\u201d or, stated another way, petitioner failed to prove he had not been convicted of any prior or subsequent crime because he pleaded guilty to multiple crimes and each was prior or subsequent to the other.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-9\">Although the trial judge did not utter the words \u201ccrime spree\u201d in his opinion, we assume he applied this principle in granting relief to petitioner. The \u201ccrime spree\u201d principle was originally enunciated in <em>Fontana, </em>and recently examined\u2014in connection with the current expungement statute\u2014in <em>In re Ross, </em>400 <em>N.J.Super. </em>117, 946 A.2d 86 (App.Div.2008). In his oral decision, the judge referred to another recent decision, <em>In re Criminal Records of R.Z., </em>429 <em>N.J.Super. </em>295, 58 A.3d 1178 (App.Div.2013), and concluded that petitioner\u2019s crimes\u2014participating in a multi-act conspiracy over the course of two days to unlawfully obtain a favorable determination on a pending municipal matter\u2014were \u201cso closely tied together\u201d as to permit the relief sought.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-10\">We reject the trial judge\u2019s interpretation and application of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:52-2(a). In <em>Ross, </em>we held the statutory language in question\u2014a person who was convicted of \u201ca crime\u201d may obtain expungement if he or she \u201chas not been convicted of any prior or subsequent crime,\u201d <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:52-2(a)\u2014is \u201cclear and unambiguous on its face and is susceptible of only one interpretation,\u201d namely, that \u201cthe words \u2018prior\u2019 and \u2018subsequent\u2019 do not modify the term \u2018conviction[,]\u2019 \u201d but instead \u201cmodify the term \u2018crime,\u2019 which leads to the conclusion that if two crimes are committed on separate occasions, they are precluded from expungement regardless of whether the two crimes carry a single sentencing date and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>therefore a single date of conviction.\u201d <em>Ross, supra, </em>400 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 122, 946 A.2d 86. We agree with that interpretation.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The Legislature used the word \u201ccrime,\u201d not \u201cconviction,\u201d in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:52-2(a), and did so in the <em>face of our </em>interpretation in <em>Fontana </em>of the earlier statute, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:164-28, which used the word \u201cconviction\u201d instead of \u201ccrime.\u201d We assume the Legislature understood the distinction when it selected the language of the current statute\u2014action very likely intended to avoid the application of the amorphous \u201ccrime-spree\u201d concept in fixture matters\u2014 and we are, therefore, bound by the Legislature\u2019s unambiguous command in such matters.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-6\">We lastly note that in a more recent unpublished opinion, we again adhered to <em>Ross\u2019s </em>interpretation of the statutory language in question when reversing an order that permitted expungement of criminal records where the petitioner was convicted of drug crimes that occurred five days apart. We are mindful that the Supreme Court has granted certification in that matter, <em>In re Expungement Petition of J.S., 217 N.J. </em>304, 88 A.3d 936 (April 11, 2014), and may soon either endorse or reject <em>Ross\u2019s </em>interpretation. Until instructed otherwise, however, we will continue to adhere to <em>Ross </em>because we agree with its interpretation of the statute. In applying <em>Ross\u2019s </em>holding, we must set aside the expungement order in question. In entering his guilty plea, petitioner admitted the commission of crimes on April 19 and April 20, 1999. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:52-2(a) only permits expungement when that relief is sought by a person who \u201chas been convicted of a crime,\u201d not crimes.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b96-7\">Reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b93-16\"> The parties have alluded to a handful of unreported decisions on this same subject rendered by this court within the last year.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b94-9\"> It is not clear whether arrest records\u2014generated through law enforcement abuses\u2014may be expunged as an equitable remedy. <em>See </em>Bd. <em>of Educ., Middletown </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number><em>Twp. v.
