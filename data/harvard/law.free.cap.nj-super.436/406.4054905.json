(temporarily assigned).</author>\n<p id=\"b453-13\">An indictment charged defendant Quaheem Johnson with various offenses, including murder, felony murder, and armed robbery, relating to his committing two separate robberies and killing one of the victims. A jury could not reach a unanimous verdict as to those charges but, as to murder and armed robbery, it convicted defendant of uncharged, lesser-included offenses. Despite the jury being deadlocked as to the greater, charged offenses, the trial court accepted the jury\u2019s verdict and had it recorded. The State sought thereafter to retry defendant on felony murder and mur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>der,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and defendant moved to bar a retrial arguing that double jeopardy principles and the improper termination of his prosecution barred a new trial as to those charges. The trial court agreed with defendant\u2019s arguments and granted his motion. We stayed further proceedings and granted the State leave to appeal the trial court\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-5\">Defendant\u2019s circumstances raise a question of first impression: whether a trial court improperly terminates a defendant\u2019s prosecution, within the meaning of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:l-9, by accepting a partial verdict where the jury is deadlocked as to greater, charged offenses, but is unanimous in its finding of guilt as to uncharged, lesser-included offenses. After considering the State\u2019s argument in the context of the unusual circumstances revealed by the record, we answer the question in the affirmative and affirm the trial court\u2019s determination that defendant\u2019s retrial on felony murder is barred because of the improper termination of his prosecution.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b454-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-7\">According to the State\u2019s proofs, on April 8, 2008, defendant shot and killed Ramon Francisco Morales while in the course of taking his necklace. Shortly thereafter, and several blocks away, defendant held another victim, Javier Galeas, at gunpoint and took his chain as well. Police responded to the scene and, after ten to fifteen minutes, spotted defendant in the general vicinity of the commission of the crimes. They commanded defendant to stop, but he fled. While being pursued, he pointed a handgun in the direction of one of the officers. As a result, the officer discharged <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>his weapon twice, but missed defendant. The officer eventually apprehended defendant, and both victims\u2019 necklaces were found on his person. The police also recovered a gun in a nearby yard, and ballistics tests later confirmed that it was the murder weapon.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-6\">Defendant was charged in an indictment with murder, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:ll-3(a) (count one); felony murder, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:ll-3(a)(3) (count two); armed robbery, as to Morales, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:15-l(b) (count three); unlawful possession of a weapon, <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:58^, 39-5(b) (count four); possession of a weapon for an unlawful purpose, as to Morales, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:39-^(a) (count five); armed robbery, as to Galeas, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:15-1 (count six); possession of a weapon for an unlawful purpose, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:39-4(a) (count seven); aggravated assault, as to police officer Jesse Hillburn,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:12-l(b)(4) (count eight); resisting arrest, <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:29-2(a) (count nine); and possession of a weapon for an unlawful purpose as to Hillburn, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:39-4(a) (count ten).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b455-7\">Defendant\u2019s first trial ended in a mistrial due to jury intimidation. The court conducted a new trial from October 9 to November 9, 2012. The jury deliberated from October 23 to October 25; then, after Hurricane Sandy, which devastated New Jersey on October 29, 2012, it continued deliberations from November 7 to November 9. The original presiding judge became unavailable, so a different judge presided over the last three days of the jury\u2019s deliberations and ultimately received the jury\u2019s verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-8\">Before charging the jury, the first judge supplied it with a verdict sheet that sequentially followed the counts in the indictment. The verdict sheet contained each of the indicted charges and, where appropriate, the uncharged, lesser-included offenses. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>It specifically instructed that the lesser-included offenses were not to be considered unless the jury\u2019s verdict was \u201cNot Guilty\u201d on the greater, charged offenses.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> It treated greater, uncharged offenses in the same manner relative to lesser, uncharged offenses\u2014the lesser offense was to be considered only if the verdict was not guilty as to the greater offense. For example, as to count one, murder, the jury was instructed to first consider \u201cpurposeful and knowing\u201d murder; then, only if its verdict was not guilty as to murder, the jury could move on to consider aggravated manslaughter. Similarly, the jury was instructed that it must first find defendant not guilty of aggravated manslaughter, before moving on to consider reckless manslaughter.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-5\">As to the jury\u2019s use of the verdict sheet, the judge initially instructed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b456-6\">Now you all have a copy of the verdict sheet, don\u2019t look at it yet though. I\u2019ll point it out to you when it\u2019s necessary. I mean, I\u2019ll\u2014as we go over each charge, I\u2019ll direct you to the verdict sheet and\u2014explain it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b456-7\">The judge then charged the jury with general instructions and followed them with charges as to each offense contained in the indictment, substantially in accordance with the model jury charges. However, unlike the verdict sheet, the judge did not sequentially follow the counts in the indictment. Instead, he first charged count three, first-degree robbery of Morales, followed by the lesser-included offenses of second-degree robbery and theft. Next, the judge charged count two, felony murder. As the judge explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b456-8\">Now I\u2019m going to go to Count 2 ... felony murder. The State contends that on April 19th, 2008, while defendant was engaged in the commission of or flight after committing the c\u00edame of robbery as charged in Count 3, which is why I defined robbery for you first....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b456-9\">You cannot find defendant guilty of felony murder unless you first find him guilty beyond a reasonable doubt of having committed the crime charged in Count 3, robbery. So that\u2019s to be your first consideration and again, which is why I gave you robbery first, all right.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b457-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>Next, the judge charged the jury with count one, murder, and then instructed,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b457-6\">If ... you determine the State has not proven beyond a reasonable doubt the defendant purposely or knowingly caused death or serious bodily injury resulting in death, then you must find him not guilty of murder and go on to consider whether the defendant should be convicted of the crimes of aggravated or reckless manslaughter.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b457-7\">While charging the jury with these two lesser-included offenses, the judge told the jury that they were to consider reckless manslaughter only if they were not convinced that defendant committed aggravated manslaughter.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-8\">At the conclusion of the court\u2019s charge as to reckless manslaughter, the judge stated, \u201cYou\u2019ll note I gave you the verdict sheet and the details of [the] lesser included [offenses are] there.\u201d Afterwards, the judge instructed the jury with the remaining charges following their sequential order in the indictment, but grouping them together where appropriate. However, the judge did not review with specificity or \u201cexplain\u201d the verdict sheet which, again, unlike the charge, was arranged sequentially, following the order of the indictment. In the judge\u2019s only other comments to the jury about the verdict sheet, he stated,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b457-9\">I\u2019ve given you the verdict sheet to assist you in ... your deliberations. The verdict sheet is evidence of nothing. It\u2019s simply a document to help you arrange your thoughts relative to deliberations and to reveal what your verdict is in open court.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b457-10\">Thereafter, following three days of initial deliberations and the hurricane-related hiatus, the second judge substituted for the first judge. Two significant incidents occurred involving the jury while the second judge presided over its deliberations.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> First, the judge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>had to address the jury\u2019s confusion about when it should consider the uncharged, lesser-included offenses about which it was instructed by the first judge. Second, the judge had to deal with a dispute that arose between two jurors.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-5\">Specifically, on November 8, the jurors asked the following in a note:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b458-6\">[W]ith regard to counts that have multiple sections that require a decision on the ... first part rather, to move to the subsequent sections, do we have to find unanimously guilty or not guilty in order to move to the next section or can we be deadlocked on the first part and move to the second and third section[?]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b458-7\">After reviewing the note with the second judge, both counsel agreed that the jury should be re-instructed to make unanimous findings as to the greater, charged offense in each count, before considering an uncharged, lesser-included offense, if appropriate, in accordance with the verdict sheet\u2019s instructions. The second judge disagreed, based on that judge\u2019s concern that by so instructing, the court would be directing the jury\u2019s deliberations. The second judge ultimately instructed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b458-8\">[T]he verdict sheet is not evidence, nor is it law. It is simply a tool that [the first judge] prepared to assist you in your deliberations. <em>You may deliberate about the charges in any order you wish to, </em>the [e]ourt cannot direct your deliberations.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b458-9\">[ (Emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b458-10\">The second judge gave that instruction recognizing that the jury could be \u201cdeadlocked\u201d as to the greater, charged offense, because \u201c[fit\u2019s happened before in eases, it\u2019s something that\u2014that can in fact, occur.\u201d The second judge, therefore, never told the jurors that they had to find defendant not guilty of the charged offense before they could consider the uncharged, lesser-included offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-11\">Before sending the jury back to continue its deliberations, the second judge also stated,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b458-12\">With that I ask you to return to the jury room. You can certainly send out any other questions you wish to and remember, please do not tell me where you stand, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>whether you are deadlocked or\u2014I\u2019m sorry, whether ... you stand\u2014whore you stand as to each eharge.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b459-6\">Later that same day, the court\u2019s officer informed the judge and counsel about a dispute between jurors two and eleven, and that juror two was outside the jury room refusing to go back in because she \u201cdid not want to be ridiculed anymore.\u201d The judge spoke to juror two with counsel present, who informed the judge that she was insulted by more than one other juror \u201cat different points.\u201d The judge then sent juror two back to the jury room and brought out juror eleven, who explained that juror two was \u201crefusing to participate or just mak[ing] up stuff that is no way related to the facts that were presented by either side of the case.\u201d Juror eleven informed the judge that \u201cwe\u2019ve all agreed that we should take a break and come back and cool off and start over in the morning.\u201d The judge sent juror eleven back to the jury room and conferred with counsel.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Defendant\u2019s attorney requested a modified <em>Allen/Czachor</em><footnotemark><em>10</em></footnotemark><em> </em>charge, although the jury <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>never informed the court that it was deadlocked. After considering the request, the judge decided not to give the charge but to break for the day.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-5\">Before the judge brought the jury into the courtroom, defendant\u2019s counsel returned to the issue of the court telling the jury not to inform the court that it was deadlocked. Counsel moved for a mistrial on that basis. The court denied the motion, telling counsel that the court would, however, \u201cremind them\u201d that the jurors should not disclose where they stand in their voting at any point in their deliberations, \u201c[o]f course that doesn\u2019t apply to whether or not they\u2019re deadlocked.\u201d When the judge brought the jury out to dismiss them for the day, the judge in fact told the jury to</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b460-6\">remember ... if you do send me questions, just to clarify something I said before, I don\u2019t want to know where you stand on any given charge____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b460-7\">But certainly for deadlock, that\u2019s a different issue, okay. So I\u2014I think I might have misspoken ... in that case. If you\u2019re deadlocked, I need to know that.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b461-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>During the rest of the jury\u2019s deliberations, the jury never informed the judge it was deadlocked, and the judge never gave the modified <em>Allen/Czaehor </em>charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-5\">Prior to the second judge\u2019s subsequently receiving the jury\u2019s verdict in open court and having it recorded, the jury sent another note to the court. The note stated that the jurors wanted \u201call the jury requests [sic] to be polled on each and every count.\u201d After conferring with counsel, the judge decided that the court would have the foreperson state the jury\u2019s verdict as to a count, do the polling as to that count by asking each juror if his or her individual verdict was guilty or not guilty, then move on to the next count. When the judge brought the jury out to take its verdict the following occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b461-6\">THE COURT: Good afternoon, Ladies and Gentlemen. I\u2019m aware that you have reached a verdict. Also, I received [a] note which I marked J-22, all of the jurors request to be polled on each and every count and I intend to do so in this regard. I will ask the foreperson what the verdict was as to each count and then move to each juror and ask whether you\u2014that is your verdict as well.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b461-7\">So would the foreperson please rise. Miss Foreperson, has this jury agreed upon a verdict?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b461-8\">MS. FOREPERSON: Yeah.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b461-9\">THE COURT: You seem hesitant. Well, is the verdict unanimous?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b461-10\">MS. FOREPERSON: Not on all counts.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b461-11\">THE COURT: Not on all counts. All right. Have you reached a verdict on any of the counts?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b461-12\">MS. FOREPERSON: Yes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b461-13\">The judge then asked counsel if they had any objection to the court proceeding to take the verdicts. The prosecutor had no objection and defendant\u2019s attorney deferred to the court\u2019s \u201cdiscretion.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b461-14\">The foreperson then advised the court that the jury did not reach a verdict as to the charged offense of count one, purposeful and knowing murder. The second judge did not poll the jury about its vote on the murder charge. Instead, the second judge immediately inquired as to the uncharged, lesser-included offense of aggravated manslaughter, despite the jury not reaching any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>verdict as to the greater charged offense of murder.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The foreperson advised the judge the jury found defendant guilty of aggravated manslaughter. The judge then polled the jurors by asking each of them, \u201c[I]s that your verdict?\u201d Each responded in the affirmative.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The judge then moved on to count two, felony murder, and the foreperson informed the court that the jury again did not reach a verdict as to that charge. The judge did not poll the jury but rather moved on to count three, armed robbery. Again, the foreperson informed the judge that the jury did not reach a verdict as to that charge. The judge moved on to the uncharged, lesser-included offense of second-degree robbery, and the foreperson informed the court that the jury found defendant guilty of that charge, and then the judge polled the jury. The judge followed the same process for the remaining counts, and the foreperson advised the court that the jury found defendant guilty of all additional charges, except for counts five, possession of a weapon for an unlawful purpose; eight, aggravated assault for pointing a firearm at Officer Hillburn; and ten, another charge of possession of a weapon for an unlawful purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-5\">The verdict sheet reflected the verdict as \u201cdeadlocked\u201d for counts one, murder; two, felony murder; three, armed robbery; five, possession of a weapon for an unlawful purpose; eight, aggravated assault; and ten, possession of a weapon for an unlawful purpose. The verdict sheet also reflected that, despite being deadlocked on the greater charged offenses, the jury rendered guilty verdicts as to aggravated manslaughter, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:ll-4(a)(l), reckless manslaughter, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:ll-4(b)(l),<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>second-degree robbery, <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:15-l(a)(2), which were all uncharged, lesser-included offenses that the verdict sheet instructed should only be considered if the jury found defendant not guilty of the charged offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-6\">After the judge received the verdict and was about to discharge the jury, one of the jurors reminded the judge that the jury \u201cwanted to be polled on all of the counts, even the ones that we\u2019ve not reached a verdict on\u2014the ones that we\u2019re deadlocked on. That was the unanimous opinion of the jury.\u201d After conferring with counsel, the court ultimately declined to poll the jurors on the undecided counts because \u201c[i]t would be inappropriate for [the court] to delve into how each of [the jurors] voted on counts in which [the jury] was not unanimous.\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The judge then thanked and discharged the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-7\">The State subsequently sought to retry defendant for murder and felony murder. Defendant filed a motion to bar a retrial based on 1) double jeopardy, and 2) improper termination of the original prosecution, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:l-9(d), l-10(a), 1\u201410(c). After considering the parties\u2019 oral argument, the first judge granted defendant\u2019s motion. As explained in the judge\u2019s written \u201cStatement of Reasons,\u201d the court found that double jeopardy precluded the State from re-trying defendant for felony murder and murder. The court further reasoned that defendant\u2019s prosecution had been improperly terminated because the jury was allowed to convict defendant of lesser-included offenses without acquitting him of the greater charges, and a retrial would be prejudicial under the circumstances. As the first judge explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b463-8\">The second trial judge did not respond specifically to the jury question relative to the order in which greater and lesser included offenses must be considered, although the first trial judge did so in [the judge\u2019s] instructions to the jury and in [the] verdict form. The second trial judge gave a response as it relates to separate counts in the indictment. That is, the jury can deliberate as to separate counts in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>the indictment in any order they wish. This did not answer the jury\u2019s specific question, although it is unknown whether the jury may have believed otherwise.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b464-5\">The second trial judge then accepted verdicts on the lesser-included offenses without the defendant being acquitted of the greater offense. Rather than acquitting the defendant on the counts of Murder, Armed Robbery, and Felony Murder, the jury informed the [jjudge that they could not reach a verdict. Despite this, the jury found the defendant guilty of Aggravated Manslaughter and Robbery; however, those offenses should not have been considered since the jury did not acquit the defendant of the greater offenses, they simply failed to reach a verdict.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b464-6\">Following <em>Cooper, </em>[<footnotemark>15</footnotemark>] if the jurors are split between the greater charge and the acquittal, the result is a \u201chung\u201d jury. Nevertheless, since the defendant has already been found guilty of Aggravated Manslaughter and Robbery, (although the evidence overwhelmingly supported a murder conviction), the defendant will be prejudiced if as a result of a \u201chung jury\u201d on the greater offenses, he is forced to go back to trial to face Felony Murder and Murder counts. The defendant would find himself facing a trial where the State is arguing elements and using evidence for charges for which he has already been found guilty. The defendant should not have to suffer because <em>Cooper, supra, </em>151 <em>N.J. </em>at 366 [700 A.2d 306], was not specifically followed. A retrial would certainly prejudice the defendant.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b464-7\">The court subsequently denied the State\u2019s motion for a stay of the proceedings, and the State then filed an emergent application to appeal the order barring retrial and denying a stay of the proceedings. Defendant did not move for leave to cross-appeal any of the trial court\u2019s rulings. Sentencing has been stayed, and no judgment of conviction has been entered.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-8\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-9\">The State contends that the court\u2019s granting of defendant\u2019s motion to bar his retrial as to felony murder constituted a misapplication of the law. Our review of \u201cthe legal conclusions and analysis of the trial court ... is plenary.\u201d <em>State v. Harris, </em>211 <em>N.J. </em>566, 578-79, 50 A.3d 15 (2012) (citing <em>State v. Handy, </em>206 <em>N.J. </em>39, 45, 18 A.3d 179 (2011)). We therefore review the judge\u2019s legal conclusions de novo. <em>State v. Harris, </em>181 <em>N.J. </em>391, 420-21, 859 A.2d 364 (2004), <em>cert. denied, </em>545 <em>U.S. </em>1145, 125 <em>S.Ct. </em>2973, 162 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>L.Ed.2d 898 (2005). Applying this standard here, we agree with the trial court that the second judge improperly terminated defendant\u2019s prosecution, thereby preventing the State from retrying him on any of the charges upon which the jury was \u201cdeadlocked.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:1-9(d), 1-10(a), 1-10(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b465-6\">Ordinarily \u201cdouble jeopardy ... do[es] not prohibit retrial of a defendant when a prior prosecution for the same offense has ended in mistrial attributable to the inability of the jury to agree on a verdict,\u201d because \u201cthe jeopardy to which the defendant is exposed is considered a continuation of original jeopardy, which was not terminated by the mistrial.\u201d <em>State v. Abbati, </em>99 <em>N.J. </em>418, 425-26, 493 A.2d 513 (1985). However, a successive prosecution for the same offense is barred if the former prosecution was improperly terminated, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:1\u20149(d), \u201cand the subsequent prosecution is for an offense of which the defendant could have been convicted had the former prosecution not been improperly terminated.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:l-10(e). Termination of a prosecution is improper \u201cif the termination is for reasons not amounting to an acquittal, and it takes place after the jury was impaneled and sworn.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:l-9(d).<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b465-7\">As we have previously explained,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b465-8\">Under the New Jersey Code of Criminal Justice, a prosecution of a defendant is barred by a former prosecution for the same offense upon the same facts when the former prosecution was improperly terminated. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:l-9d. However, a termination is not considered improper where \u201c[t]he trial court finds that the termination is necessary because of the failure of the jury to agree upon a verdict after a reasonable time for deliberation has been allowed.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:l-9d(2). The trial court is vested with \u201cbroad discretionary authority\u201d to declare a mistrial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>due to a deadlocked jury and its decision to do so may be reversed only for an abuse of discretion.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b466-5\"><em>[State v.

Generally, a matter is not terminated until the jury\u2019s verdict is final, which occurs when \u201c \u2018the deliberations are over, the result is announced in open court, and no dissent by a juror is registered.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v.

Where the court determines that, in a criminal action, the jury has not reached a unanimous verdict, \u201cthe jury may be directed to retire for further deliberations or discharged.\u201d <em>R. </em>1:8-10. A judge has discretion to require further deliberations after a jury has announced its inability to agree, <em>Figueroa, supra, </em>190 <em>N.J. </em>at 235, 919 A.2d 826, \u201cbut exercise of that discretion is not appropriate \u2018if the jury has reported a definite deadlock after a reasonable period <em>of </em>deliberations.\u2019\u201d <em>State v.

Under those circumstances, a mistrial may be declared which \u201c \u2018is not a judgment or order in favor of any of the parties\u2019 and \u2018lacks the finality of a judgment and means that the trial itself was a nullity.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v.

Ruiz, </em>399 <em>N.J.Super. </em>86, 99, 943 A.2d 175 (App.Div.2008). However, \u201c[b]ecause of the potential compromise to either a defendant\u2019s or government\u2019s interests, and the risk of interfering with jury deliberations, we <em>strongly discourage </em>routine use of partial verdicts.\u201d <em>Shomo, supra, </em>129 <em>N.J. </em>at 257, 609 A.2d 394 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b467-11\">Before accepting either a complete or partial verdict which includes counts upon which the jury is \u201chung\u201d or \u201cdeadlocked,\u201d a court must determine if the deadlock is \u201cintractable.\u201d <em>Ross, supra, </em>218 <em>N.J. </em>at 145, 93 A.3d 739 (quoting <em>Figueroa, supra, </em>190 <em>N.J. </em>at 237, 919 A.2d 826). If, after considering \u201csuch factors as the length and complexity of [the] trial and the quality and duration of the jury\u2019s deliberations,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 144, 93 A.3d 739 (quoting <em>Czachor, supra, </em>82 <em>N.J. </em>at 407, 413 A.2d 593), the court is not satisfied that the deadlock is \u201cintractable,\u201d the court should instruct the jury with the modified <em>Allen/Czachor </em>charge and direct the jury to continue its deliberations. <em>Id. </em>at 143-45, 93 A.3d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>739; <em>Czachor, supra, </em>82 <em>N.J. </em>at 407, 413 A.2d 593. As the Court recently noted,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b468-5\">In authorizing continued deliberations following a deadlock and an instruction, this Court declined to hold in <em>Czachor, supra, </em>that an initial impasse signals the end of meaningful deliberations. 82 <em>N.J. </em>at 404-06 [413 A.2d 593] (directing trial courts, in appropriate circumstances, to charge deadlocked jury to continue deliberations). To the contrary, the <em>Czachor </em>charge instructs jurors to consider the viewpoints of other jurors with an open mind. <em>See Model Jury Charge (Criminal), </em>\u201cJudge\u2019s Instructions on Further Jury Deliberations\u201d (Jan. 14, 2013). In short, <em>Czachor </em>contemplates that a previously deadlocked jury can conduct fair and effective deliberations notwithstanding <em>an </em>earlier impasse.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b468-6\">[Ross, <em>supra, </em>218 <em>N.J. </em>at 154, 93 A.3d 739.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b468-7\">A declaration of a mistrial is then warranted only when the jury \u201csignal[s] an intractable divide,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 145, 93 A.3d 739, and the court is satisfied that \u201cthe jury has made a good-faith effort to reach a sustainable verdict\u201d after the court first considers \u201cthe duration of the deliberations balanced against the length of the trial and the complexity of the proofs.\u201d <em>Dorsainvil, supra, </em>435 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 481, 89 A.3d 584.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-8\">In this case, the second judge received the partial verdict in open court and recorded it even though the jury informed the court, for the first time, at the outset of the verdict proceedings, that it had not reached a verdict as to the first count. The second judge never made further inquiry as to the nature of the deadlock, nor did the judge perform the required analysis to determine whether to proceed to deliver the modified <em>Allen/Czachor </em>charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-9\">Also, we are satisfied that there is a substantial likelihood that the verdict was the result of the second judge\u2019s erroneous instructions to the jurors about the manner and sequence in which they could consider the uncharged, lesser-included offenses. <em>See Cooper, supra, </em>151 <em>N.J. </em>at 366, 700 A.2d 306.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> The fact that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>verdict sheet correctly advised the jurors that they could not consider the uncharged, lesser-included offenses unless they reached a verdict of not guilty on the greater charge did not cure the problem. \u201cA verdict sheet is intended for recordation of the jury\u2019s verdict and is not designed to supplement oral jury instructions.\u201d <em>State v. Gandhi, </em>201 <em>N.J. </em>161, 196, 989 A.2d 256 (2010). Therefore, \u201c[a] jury verdict must be guided by correct legal instructions and \u2018erroneous instructions on matters material to the juror\u2019s deliberations are presumed to be reversible error.\u2019 \u201d <em>Dorsainvil, supra, </em>435 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 480, 89 A.3d 584 (quoting <em>State v. Allen, </em>308 <em>N.J.Super. </em>421, 431, 706 A.2d 220 (App.Div.1998)). While, as the first judge correctly noted, the second judge\u2019s instructions addressed the order in which the jury could consider the various counts of the indictment,<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> it did not address the manner the jurors should consider the uncharged, lesser-included offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-6\">We are satisfied that the cumulative effect of 1) the court\u2019s failure to properly instruct the jury about the limited circumstances in which it would be permitted to consider the uncharged, lesser-included offenses, 2) its failure to insist on there being a unanimous not guilty verdict before taking the verdict on the uncharged, lesser-included offenses, 3) its failure to review the verdict sheet with the jurors, combined with 4) the apparent confusion caused by the court\u2019s initially telling the jury to not inform the court if it was deadlocked should have resulted in the court not accepting the jury\u2019s verdict as final when the court learned the jury was deadlocked. Rather than proceeding to accept improper, partial verdicts, the court should have considered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>the extent of the jury\u2019s deadlock and reinstructed the jury about the proper manner to consider the uncharged offenses. It should then have directed them to continue their deliberations. We recognize the second judge\u2019s well-intentioned desire to refrain from interfering unduly in the jury\u2019s deliberations. However, the second judge nonetheless strayed too far from case law disfavoring partial verdicts in the judge\u2019s deference to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-5\">Because of these numerous critical errors and omissions, the jury was allowed to reach verdicts on charges in specific counts that they should not have even considered had they been instructed properly. The erroneous instructions tainted the jury\u2019s consideration of all of the unresolved charges, including felony murder, because, under these circumstances, not only was defendant\u2019s prosecution \u201cimproperly terminated,\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:1\u20149(d), but there was also a potential that defendant\u2019s right to a unanimous jury verdict was denied, <em>Shomo, supra, </em>129 <em>N.J. </em>at 258, 609 A.2d 394. To allow a retrial on felony murder in this case would be a clear miscarriage of justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-6\">Affirmed. Remanded for sentencing and the entry of a judgment of conviction.

We are sympathetic to those circumstances into which the second judge was placed with very little notice.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b459-7\"> After the jury returned to deliberate, counsel pointed out to the second judge that the judge told the jury not to disclose if it was deadlocked.

It was not, although, as we note <em>infra, </em>it was later addressed by the second judge.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b459-8\"> Although not an issue before us, we note that the judge did not question the other jurors about whether the feuding jurors' dispute impacted their deliberations, or give any instructions to the jury about the dispute or take any further action to guarantee the integrity of the deliberations or the safety of the jurors. <em>See State v. Dorsainvil, </em>435 <em>N.J.Super. 449, </em>487 &amp; n. 20, 89 A.3d 584 (App.Div. 2014) (\"When violence intrudes into the deliberative process in any form and to any degree, a trial judge must take immediate action to investigate what occurred, not only to determine whether a defendant's right to a fair and impartial trial has been compromised, but also to ensure the safety and security of all involved.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b459-9\"> <em>Allen v.
