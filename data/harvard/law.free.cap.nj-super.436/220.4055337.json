Likewise, because this litigation has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>been conducted in several different courts, we discuss its procedural history in greater detail than we otherwise might.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-5\">\n<em>THE PENSION SYSTEMS</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b274-6\">Resolution of this appeal requires a review of the statutory framework and history surrounding the: 1) State-administered retirement systems; 2) Pension Adjustment Act, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>43:3B-1 to -10; and 3) non-forfeitable rights statute, <em>N.J.S.A </em>43:3C-9.5. We will discuss that framework here.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-7\">A. <em>The State-Administered Retirement Systems</em></p>\n<p id=\"b274-8\">Plaintiffs in <em>Berg </em>are a group of twenty-six retired attorneys who are currently receiving pension benefits through the Public Employees\u2019 Retirement System (PERS), <em>N.J.S.A </em>43.T5A-1 to - 141. PERS was established in 1954, <em>L. </em>1954, c. 84, and is the largest of the State-administered retirement systems. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>52:18A-108(c). The intervenors in <em>Berg </em>are retired and active vested members in the three largest state-administered defined benefit retirement systems: 1) PERS; 2) the Police and Firemen\u2019s Retirement System (PFRS), established in 1944, <em>L. </em>1944, c. 253, under <em>N.J.S.A </em>43:16A-1 to -16.2; and 3) the Teachers\u2019 Pension and Annuity Fund (TPAF), reorganized in 1955, under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>18A:66-1 to -93. The <em>DeLucia </em>plaintiffs are retired members of PFRS.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-9\">PERS, PFRS, and TPAF are governed by separate boards of trustees. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>43:15A-17 (PERS); <em>N.J.S.A. </em>43:16A-13 (PFRS); and <em>N.J.S.A </em>18A:66-56 (TPAF). The day-to-day administration of the retirement systems is conducted by the Department of the Treasury, Division of Pensions and Benefits. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>52:18A-95 to -100 (Division of Pensions); <em>N.J.S.A </em>43:15A-18 (PERS); <em>N.J.S.A. </em>43:16A-13 (PFRS); <em>N.J.S.A. </em>18A:66-57 (TPAF). Employees are vested in these systems after having obtained ten years of service credit. <em>N.J.S.A </em>43:15A-38 (PERS); <em>N.J.S.A. </em>43:16A-11.2 (PFRS); <em>N.J.S.A. </em>18A:66-36 (TPAF).</p>\n<p id=\"b275-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>The State-administered retirement systems are funded by: 1) contributions from employees\u2019 wages; 2) contributions from the State, as the employer; and 3) the return earned on invested assets. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>43:15A-24 (PERS); <em>N.J.S.A. </em>43:16A-15 (PFRS); <em>N.J.S.A. </em>18A:66-18 (TPAF). <em>See also N.J.

As the Division of Pensions explained in its Employers\u2019 Pension and Benefits Administration Manual (EPBAM), in the State pension systems the employer is essentially \u201cresponsible for filling the gap between the funds needed to meet the retirement system obligations and those available from employee contributions and investment earnings on system assets.\u201d <em>Employers\u2019 Pension and Benefits Administration Manual (EPBAM), </em>http://www.nj.gov/ treasury/pensions/epbam/pensions/fundingl.htm (last visited June 12, 2014).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b275-7\">The State is statutorily required to contribute, to each system or fund, both a \u201cnormal contribution,\u201d which includes basic retirement allowances and COLAs as determined by the board of trustees in consultation with the system\u2019s or fund\u2019s actuary, and an accrued liability contribution. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>43:3C-9.5(c)(l). \u201cThe <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>amount of the State\u2019s annually required contributions shall be included in all annual appropriations acts as a dedicated line item,\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>43:3C-9.5(c)(1), and the Legislature \u201cshall make an appropriation sufficient to provide for the obligations of the State.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>43:15A-37 (PERS); <em>N.J.S.A. </em>18A:66-33 (TPAF). Commencing July 1, 2011, the State\u2019s contribution</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AE2\">shall be made in full each year to each system or fund in the manner and at the time provided by law. The contribution shall be computed by actuaries for each system or fund based on an annual valuation of the assets and liabilities of the system or fund pursuant to consistent and generally accepted actuarial standards and shall include the normal contribution and the unfunded accrued liability contribution. The State with regard to its obligations funded through the annual appropriations act shall be in compliance with this requirement provided the State makes a payment, to each State-administered retirement system or fund, of at least l/7th of the full contribution, as computed by the actuaries, in the State fiscal year commencing July 1, 2011 and a payment in each subsequent fiscal year that increases by at least an additional l/7th until payment of the full contribution is made in the seventh fiscal year and thereafter.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-5\"><em>[N.J.S.A </em>43:30-14.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b276-6\">The money in the pension funds is held in trust for the exclusive use of the members or their beneficiaries. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>43:3C-9.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-7\">B. <em>The Pension Adjustment Act</em></p>\n<p id=\"b276-8\">In 1958, at approximately the same time that PERS, PFRS, and TPAF were established, the Pension Adjustment Act, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>43:3B-1 to -10, was adopted. <em>L. </em>1958, c. 143. The Act provided for limited modest increases, based on a fixed adjustment, to the first $480 of the retirement allowances of state employees (including members of PERS, PFRS, and TPAF), who had retired before 1952, that is, prior to the advent of Social Security coverage for public employees. <em>L. </em>1958, <em>c. </em>143. The State, as employer, bore the cost of the adjustments (except TPAF), which were, as initially enacted, to be made on a \u201cpay-as-you-go\u201d basis and were subject to appropriation by the Legislature. <em>L. </em>1958, c. 143. The Sponsor\u2019s Statement to the bill explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-9\">This bill is intended to meet in some part the situation that exists for certain former public employees who, having retired on pensions based on the salary levels of many years ago, now face varying degrees of hardship because of serious increases in the cost of living since their retirement. Some of these retired <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>employees have in fact been obliged to seek old age assistance, and it is expected that this bill will provide an alternative for them on a more dignified, even-handed basis. <em>There is no attempt in this bill to suggest the general need for a cost-of-living index, or an escalator clause, for pension or retirement systems. </em>The great majority of New Jersey\u2019s public employees have been covered under the Federal Old Age and Survivors\u2019 Insurance program in recent years, and the benefits payable under this program have tended to increase with increases in the cost of living, thus the problem may not be as severe in the future.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b277-5\">A cut-off point, beyond which no adjustment of pension would be made, is, of necessity, arbitrary, but, in this bill, the factors have been continued to a date low enough, 1951 (13% increase in the basic amount), to represent liberal treatment of the meaning of \u201chardship.\u201d No increase is provided in those cases where the ratio of increase would be so small that the average taxpayer usually must adjust to it in his own personal way; in fact, an extension of the schedule of increases into this area would involve the State in administrative costs utterly disproportionate to the benefits that would result.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b277-6\"><em>[Sponsor\u2019s Statement to Assembly Bill No. 367, </em>at 4-5 (March 24, 1958) (emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b277-7\">In 1961, the Act was amended to increase the retirement allowance by applying an increased percentage adjustment to the first $600 in benefits, and by adding employees who had retired in 1952, 1958 and 1954. <em>L. </em>1961, c. 144. The Sponsor\u2019s Statement explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b277-8\">The adjustment formula is intended to overcome the loss of real income by a retired person as a result of constantly rising prices____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b277-9\">The Pension Increase Act of 1958 now provides for increases to persons retired prior to January 1, 1952. This date marked the point where the Inadequate Pensions Committee formula showed a loss of at least 10% in purchasing power due to inflation after retirement. Since 1958 the cost of living has continued to rise and the fixed incomes of retired public employees have been reduced still further in purchasing power. The present bill applies the committee formula to correct this---- This adjustment preserves the principle that no increase should be provided unless the loss of purchasing power is at least 10%.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b277-12\"><em>[Sponsor\u2019s Statement to Assembly Bill No. 559, </em>at 3-4 (May 1,1961).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b277-13\">In 1964, the statute was amended to apply the percentage adjustment to the first $900 in retirement allowance. <em>L. </em>1964, c. 198, \u00a7 1. Then Governor Hughes confirmed that the \u201cprogram extends only to those who retired prior to 1955 and prior to the advent of Social Security coverage.\u201d <em>Governor\u2019s Statement upon Signing Assembly Bill No. 610, L. </em>1964, c. 198 (Oct. 13, 1964).</p>\n<p id=\"b278-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>The first major revision to the Act was made in 1969, when the Act was amended to: 1) grant adjustments or COLAs to all eligible retirants of state-administered pension systems, not just those who retired before 1955; and 2) provide adjustments based on an amount equal to one-half of the percentage of the change in the Consumer Price Index (CPI), not a fixed formula. <em>L. </em>1969, c. 169, \u00a7 1. <em>See Brown v. Twp. of Old Bridge, </em>319 <em>N.J.Super. </em>476, 511, 725 A.2d 1154 (App.Div.) (increases in annual COLAs are calculated by reference to CPI to protect retirees from increased inflation), <em>certif. denied, </em>162 <em>N.J. </em>131, 741 A.2d 99 (1999). The Sponsor\u2019s Statement explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b278-5\">This bill will help protect retired public employees against excessive loss of purchasing power caused by inflation. The bill is partially based on existing legislation which provides for fixed increases to certain public pensioners. This bill does the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b278-6\">1. It provides that those who retired prior to 1955 (prior to ... Social Security coverage ...) will receive an increase in accordance with the changes in the cost of living appropriate to them calendar year of retirement as such percentage of increase will be applied to the full allowance of the retirant rather than to any part of that allowance.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b278-7\">2. It permits adjustments for most retirants effective, July 1, 1970 <em>if funds are appropriated to provide for such increases.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b278-8\">3.

As described in then Governor Corzine\u2019s February 24, 2008, Budget Summary presented to the Legislature:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b280-7\">The seeds of this problem were sown in the mid-1990s, when New Jersey sold pension bonds and revalued its pension investments (from their original \u201cbook\u201d value to then current market value). These tactics enabled the State to avoid making its normal appropriations into the system, thus relinquishing those resources to support other programs. The pension funds were invested in the stock market and, initially, produced a sizeable balance. That balance provided a convenient rationalization for two things: 1) the elimination of State and local government contributions (i.e., pension \u201cholidays\u201d) totaling an estimated $8 billion over seven years; and 2) an expansion of benefits through changes in the calculation of pension benefit payments. From fiscal 1997 through 2005, no appropriations were made to ... (PERS), the State\u2019s largest system. Similarly, from fiscal 2000 through 2005, no appropriations were provided to the next largest system ... (TPAF).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b280-8\">Beginning in fiscal 2000, however, the value of the State\u2019s pension investments declined precipitously due to the stock market crash, resulting in an asset loss of approximately $20 billion (24%) by the end of fiscal 2002. Income tax receipts over this same period also were adversely affected. However, instead of instituting deep program cuts to re-align budget expenses with available revenues, the State shorted the pension system by substituting excess pension assets in place of the normal cash appropriation. The Benefit Enhancement Fund, which was originally created to support some of the aforementioned benefit expansions, was also tapped for this purpose.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b280-9\">This combination of asset losses and increased benefits triggered a rapid and steady increase in the system\u2019s unfunded liability (i.e., degree to which the actuarially-determined obligations exceed the value of pension assets). From fiscal 2004 to the present, the unfunded liability more than doubled, from $12 billion to approximately $25 billion, of which $16.6 billion represents the State\u2019s liability.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b280-10\"><em>[FY 2009 Budget In Brief, Executive Summary, </em>at 19.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b281-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>D. <em>The Non-fin feitable Right Statute</em></p>\n<p id=\"b281-6\">In 1997, the Legislature introduced a bill, signed into law on June 5, 1997, conforming the administration of certain State-administered retirement systems, including PERS, PFRS, and TPAF, to federal Internal Revenue Code requirements; however, the bill also established \u201ccertain non-forfeitable\u201d pension rights. <em>L. </em>1997, c. 113, \u00a7 2.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Significant to this appeal, the law provided that vested members \u201cshall have a non-forfeitable right to receive benefits as provided under the laws governing the retirement system or fund upon the attainment of five years of service credit in the retirement system or fund....\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>43:3C-9.5(b). \u201c[A] \u2018non-forfeitable right to receive benefits\u2019 means that the benefits program, for any employee for whom the right has attached, cannot be reduced.

Plaintiffs alleged the suspension constituted a breach of express and implied contract (counts one and two), violated the Contract and Due Process Clauses of the Federal and State Constitutions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>(counts three, four, and six), and violated their state civil rights (count five). They sought a judgment declaring Chapter 78 unconstitutional, a permanent injunction, monetary damages, and attorneys\u2019 fees and costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-5\">On February 2, 2012, defendants filed a <em>Rule </em>4:6-2(e) motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.

The judge found that the suspension of COLAs under Chapter 78 was constitutional because, under the Debt Limitation and Appropriations Clauses, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>the Legislature retained continuing authority to amend the pension systems. The judge did not decide plaintiffs\u2019 Contract Clause, and other claims.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> On June 20, 2012, the judge issued an amended order dismissing plaintiffs\u2019 complaints.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b289-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b289-7\">On an appeal from a summary judgment order, our review is de novo, and we owe no deference to the trial court\u2019s legal interpretations. <em>See Perez v. Professionally Green, LLC, </em>215 <em>N.J. </em>388, 398-99, 73 A.3d 452 (2013). We agree with the <em>Berg </em>plaintiffs <footnotemark>9</footnotemark> that the trial court erred in premising its decision on the Debt Limitation and Appropriations Clauses of the New Jersey Constitution. The Appropriations Clause, <em>N.J. Const, </em>art. VIII, \u00a7 2, 112, requires \u201cthat the State\u2019s finances be conducted on the basis of a single fiscal year covered by a single balanced budget.\u201d <em>N.J. Educ. Ass\u2019n, supra, </em>412 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 216, 989 A.2d 282. The clause generally bars the courts from ordering the Legislature to appropriate funds. <em>City of Camden v. Byrne, </em>82 <em>N.J. </em>133, 149, 411 A.2d 462 (1980). The Debt Limitation Clause, <em>N.J. Const. </em>art. VIII, \u00a7 2, U 3, prohibits \u201c \u2018one Legislature from incurring debts which subsequent Legislatures would be obliged to pay, without prior approval by public referendum.\u2019 \u201d <em>City of Camden, supra, </em>82 <em>N.J. </em>at 152, 411 A.2d 462 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b290-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>There is no dispute that, at the current time, there are sufficient funds in the pension systems to pay COLAs to current retirees. Moreover, pensions are neither funded by appropriations on a pay-as-you-go basis, in the way that COLAs used to be, nor is their payment contingent on the making of a current appropriation. <em>Compare N.J.S.A. </em>43:3B-4.1 <em>with N.J.S.A. </em>43:3B-4a. During the years that the State skipped making its pension contributions, the pension systems continued paying COLAs to retirees. In fact, in 2010, the State assured this court that the pension systems were capable of paying out benefits for the next thirty years, despite the State\u2019s failure to make its contributions to the funds. <em>N.J. Educ. Ass\u2019n, supra, </em>412 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 215 n. 14, 989 A.2d 282. Hence, COLAs can be paid currently without the need for any legislative appropriation. Consequently, neither the Appropriations Clause nor the Debt Limitation Clause is currently implicated here, where the issue is payment to retirees from the pension funds rather than payment by the Legislature into the funds. <em>See City of Camden, supra, </em>82 <em>N.J. </em>at 148-53, 411 A.2d 462; <em>N.J. Educ. Ass\u2019n, supra, </em>412 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 215, 989 A.2d 282 (noting the \u201cclear distinction between the right to receive pension benefits and the funding method adopted by the Legislature to assure that monies are available for the payment of such benefits\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b290-5\">It may be argued that if the pension funds are not restored to fiscal health, at some point the money will run out and an appropriation will be needed to restore the funds\u2019 solvency. A lawsuit aimed at requiring such an appropriation would implicate both the Appropriations Clause and the Debt Limitation Clause. <em>See N.J. Educ. Ass\u2019n, supra, </em>412 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 216, 989 A.2d 282. However, we conclude that in this lawsuit, such a potential eventuality does not trigger either clause. <em>See Passaic, supra, </em>18 <em>N.J. </em>at 147, 113 A.2d 22 (finding no violation of the Debt Limitation Clause in the creation of a pension fund to which State law provides the State \u201cshall\u201d contribute); <em>Enourato v. N.J. Bldg. Auth, </em>90 <em>N.J. </em>396, 402-03, 410, 448 A.2d 449 (1982) (holding that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>contracts subject to legislative appropriation do not violate the Debt Limitation Clause, but recognizing that the State\u2019s failure to honor its financial commitments may affect its bond rating).</p>\n<p id=\"b291-6\">Nor can we agree with the trial court\u2019s conclusion that <em>N.J.S.A. </em>43:3C-9.5(e) defeats plaintiffs\u2019 contract claim. Subsection (e) reserves to the Legislature the \u201cright to alter, modify or amend\u201d the retirement systems, <em>\u201c[ejxcept as expressly provided herein </em>----\u201d <em>Ibid, </em>(emphasis added). Reading section 9.5 as a whole, the emphasized phrase clearly refers to the rights created in sections 9.5(a) and (b), which are exceptions to the reserved right to alter, modify or amend the retirement systems. Thus, section 9.5 gives retired or vested members a non-forfeitable right to their pension benefits as described in subsections (a) and (b), while subsection (e) allows the State to modify the pension systems as to employees or retirees to whom subsection (b) does not apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-9\">We have considered the additional contentions raised by the <em>Berg </em>plaintiffs, and we conclude that, to a large extent, they are recycling arguments that were litigated and decided adversely to the intervenor-plaintiffs in the prior state and federal lawsuits noted in section I of this opinion. Those arguments were properly addressed and rejected by Judge Mary Jacobson, <em>New Jersey Education Association v. State, </em>No. L-0771-12 (Law Div. June 13, 2013), and Judge Anne Thompson, <em>New Jersey Education Association v. State, </em>Civ. No. 11-5024 (D.N.J. March 5, 2012). With respect to the State\u2019s Eleventh Amendment immunity, we add that the State may not \u201cbe forced to entertain in its own courts suits from which it was immune in federal court.... \u201d <em>Howlett v. Rose, </em>496 <em>U.S. 356, </em>365, 110 <em>S.Ct. </em>2430, 2437, 110 L.Ed.2d 332, 346 (1990); <em>see also Alden v. Maine, </em>527 <em>U.S. </em>706, 748, 119 <em>S.Ct. </em>2240, 2263, 144 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>636, 673-74 (1999). Because the State has sovereign immunity with respect to plaintiffs\u2019 federal causes of action, plaintiffs\u2019 federal Contract Clause claims were properly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>dismissed.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> <em>See Allen v. Fauver, </em>167 <em>N.J. </em>69, 75, 768 A.2d 1055 (2001). With the exception of their State Contract Clause claims (discussed in section III, infra), the <em>Berg </em>plaintiffs\u2019 arguments are without sufficient merit to warrant further discussion in a written opinion. <em>R. </em>2:11-3(e)(1)(E).</p>\n<p id=\"b292-5\">Turning to the <em>DeLucia </em>case, plaintiffs are former law enforcement officers who were wounded in the line of duty and retired on disability pensions paid by the Police and Firemen\u2019s Retirement System (PFRS).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> In an effort to differentiate themselves from the <em>Berg </em>plaintiffs, they filed a separate lawsuit, raising claims based on the Victims\u2019 Rights Amendment, <em>N.J. Const, </em>art. I, 1f 22; the Crime Victim\u2019s Bill of Rights, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>52:4B-34 to -38; and the tax-exemption and non-assignability provision of the PFRS statute, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>43:16A-17. In an oral opinion issued on August 24, 2012, the trial court dismissed their complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-6\">While we are not unsympathetic to the <em>DeLucia </em>plaintiffs and the sacrifices they made during their law enforcement careers, the statutory and constitutional provisions they cite are irrelevant to the issue of their entitlement to a pension or a COLA. Without relying on <em>N.J.S.A </em>43:3C-9.5, these plaintiffs also argue more generally that a COLA represents deferred compensation which the State cannot deny them. These and related arguments were properly rejected by the trial court. Plaintiffs\u2019 appellate arguments do not merit further discussion here. <em>R. </em>2:ll-3(e)(l)(E).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b293-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>Hence, we turn to the contract issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b293-7\">A. <em>The Existence of a Contractual Right</em></p>\n<p id=\"b293-8\">Plaintiffs claim that the following language gives vested or retired employees a contractual right to receive not only basic pension benefits but COLAs:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b293-9\">a. For purposes of this section, a \u201cnon-forfeitable right to receive benefits\u201d means that the benefits program, for any employee for whom the right has attached, cannot be reduced.

Vested members of [PERS, PFRS, TPAF, and other retirement systems], upon the attainment of five years of service credit in the retirement system or fund or on the date of enactment of this bill, whichever is later, shall have a non-forfeitable right to receive benefits as provided under the laws governing the retirement system or fund upon the attainment of five years of service credit in the retirement system or fund or on the effective date of this act, whichever is later.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b293-11\"><em>[N.J.S.A. </em>43:3C-9.5(a) and (b).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b293-12\">We begin with some basic principles of statutory interpretation. In construing any legislation, we attempt to determine and effectuate the intent of the Legislature. <em>Allen v. V. &amp; A Bros., Inc., </em>208 <em>N.J. </em>114, 127, 26 A.3d 430 (2011). We first consider the statute\u2019s plain language, but \u201c[w]hen \u2018the Legislature\u2019s intent cannot be derived from the words that it has chosenf,]\u2019 a court may use extrinsic tools such as legislative history, legal commentary, sponsors\u2019 statements, or a Governor\u2019s press release.\u201d <em>Nini v. Mercer Cnty. Cmty. Coll., </em>202 <em>N.J. </em>98, 108, 995 A.2d 1094 (2010) (citations omitted). Indeed, \u201c[statutes cannot be read in a vacuum void of relevant historical and policy considerations and related legislation.\u201d <em>Borough of Matawan v. Monmouth Cnty. Bd. of Taxation, </em>51 <em>N.J </em>291, 299, 240 A.2d 8 (1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b294-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>Because pension legislation is remedial in nature, it should generally be liberally construed in favor of the employee. <em>Klumb v.

However, in this case, the principle is in tension with the general rule that statutes are not to be construed as creating contracts.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-5\">Because the primary role of the Legislature is to enact statutes, not to create contracts, our courts are generally reluctant to imply a contract created by legislation. <em>N.J. Educ. Ass\u2019n, supra, </em>412 <em>N.J.Super, </em>at 206, 989 A.2d 282. That reluctance extends to the State\u2019s pension funds. The concept was explored at length in <em>Spina, supra, </em>41 <em>N.J. </em>at 403-04, 197 A.2d 169, which involved a pension crisis arising from a combination of overly generous benefits and inadequate funding. In upholding the Legislature\u2019s power to increase the retirement age and years-of-service requirement, the Court declined to characterize the pension right as contractual.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b294-6\">In these circumstances, it seems idle to sum up either the public\u2019s or the employee\u2019s contribution in one crisp word. We have no doubt that pension benefits are not a gratuity within the constitutional ban against the donation of public moneys____And we think the employee has a property interest in an existing fund which the State could not simply confiscate. Whether the interest thus secured fi'om arbitrary action is limited to the employee\u2019s own contribution or extends to the entire fund and whether it becomes still more secure upon retirement, we need not <em>say____The usual situation, as in the case before us, is a fund, that cannot meet all of the present and future demands upon it.

What happens if the plan is unsound, so that little or nothing will remain for those presently contributing? ... As a practical matter, legislative intervention is the only sensible approach... True the needed power in the Legislature to revise a plan without the consent of the parties to the \u201ccontract\u201d could be said to be \u201cimplied,\u201d but it seems odd to say the State may unilaterally rewrite its own contract.... We think it more accurate to acknowledge the inadequacy of the contractual concept.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b295-8\"><em>[Id- </em>at 403-04, 197 A.2d 169.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b295-9\">Mindful of our required hesitancy to infer legislative contracts, and the practical difficulties the Court described in <em>Spina, </em>we nonetheless find that the non-forfeitable rights statute enacted in 1997 created a contractual right. Based on our review of the legislative history of the Act, we conclude that the creation of a contractual right to pension benefits stemmed from concerns raised by public employee unions after the State, through 1994 legislation, re-valued pension fund assets, <em>L. </em>1994, c. 62, and later skipped making contributions to the pension funds.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-10\">During a May 20, 1996 legislative hearing on the State\u2019s public pension systems, then-State Treasurer Bryan Clymer insisted that the pension systems were fiscally sound, despite concerns expressed by public employee unions. <em>Public Hearing Before Senate State Management, Investment and Financial Institutions Committee </em>(May 20,1996) (Pension Hearing). He stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b295-11\">Public employee and teacher unions opposed pension reform, and are now suing me personally in Federal court in an attempt to overturn the reform. Their argument is that we are underfunding the retirement systems and, in the near future, contributions will rise dramatically. This, they claim, will result in voter and taxpayer outcry for a reduction in pension benefits.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b295-12\"><em>[Pension Hearing </em>at 3-4.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b295-13\">In response, a union representative challenged Clymer to support S-1132, a recently-introduced bill that would guarantee public employees a contractual right to their pension benefits:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b296-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>We believe that S-1132 achieves the level of security that most public employees are entitled to and that Treasurer Clymer maintains they have. If the pension funds are as secure as the Treasurer and his actuary maintain, he should have no problem signing off on S-1132. This bill simply affirms that vested members of the various public retirement systems have a contractual property right to a secure and financially sound retirement system and the benefits provided by that system.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b296-5\"><em>[Pension Hearing </em>at 53.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b296-6\">The hearing was chaired by Senator Peter Inverso,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> the principal sponsor of S-1119, which was eventually adopted as the 1997 non-forfeiture legislation. Senator Inverso introduced S-1119 on May 9, 1996, two weeks before the hearing. Unlike S-1132, the bill the unions supported, S-1119 originally did not contain a contractual rights provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-7\">The original sponsor\u2019s statement,\u2019 as well as the language of the original bill, made clear that its purpose was \u201cto conform the administration of the [pension systems] to federal Internal Revenue Code requirements in order to maintain the qualified status of these retirement systems and pension funds.\u201d <em>Sponsor\u2019s Statement to Senate Bill No. 1119, </em>at 4 (May 9, 1996). The bill stemmed from an investigation by the Internal Revenue Service based on allegations that the State had illegally diverted pension funds to other uses. The lawsuit had been settled on March 21, 1996, with the State agreeing to restore the funds to the pension system.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-8\">During the May 20, 1996 hearing, a union representative explained the employees\u2019 concern that, as a result of skipping pension payments, the State would eventually find itself facing a need to make a much larger contribution in the future, would balk at such a large expenditure, and would instead try to cut benefits. He urged, \u201cit is critical that this Legislature guarantee the benefits that employees have earned\u201d and argued that the Legisla<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>ture should accomplish that goal by providing a contractual right to the benefits. <em>Pension Hearing </em>at 68-69.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-5\">Senator Inverso responded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b297-6\">I feel strongly that the same protections and rights that are accorded ... under an ERISA [Employee Retirement Income Security Act] standard to people in the private sector, should be accorded to people in the public sector, the governmental sector; that once they have their pensions established as at a point in time with regard to vesting it, that you cannot go back retroactively and change what has been earned, what has been accrued, what has been vested in.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b297-7\"><em>[Pension Hearing </em>at 69.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b297-8\">Senator Inverso indicated that he was prepared to negotiate with the \u201cadministration\u201d (presumably, the Executive Branch) on that point. <em>Pension Hearing </em>at 70.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-9\">On April 17, 1997, Senate Bill No. 1119, was amended by the Senate Budget and Appropriations Committee to add the non-forfeiture provision.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> The Committee Statement to the bill reiterated its purpose to ensure that the pension systems conformed to Internal Revenue Code requirements. However, the Statement also recited that, with the exception of medical benefits, the bill amendments</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b297-10\">[pjrovide a vested member of a system or fund listed in the bill with a non-forfeitable right to receive benefits as provided under the laws governing the retirement system or fund in effect on the date of attainment of five years of service credit in the system or fund by the member.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b297-11\"><em>[Committee\u2019s Statement to Senate Bill No. 1119, </em>at 2 (April 17,1997).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b297-12\">Nothing in the Statement suggested that COLAs, as opposed to medical benefits, were to be excluded from the non-forfeitable rights provision. The Statement also noted that the bill required the State \u201cto make annual normal contributions and annual unfunded accrued liability contributions to each retirement system or fund except under two circumstances set forth in the bill.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b297-13\">In a recent case, the State conceded that retirees have a contractual right to the basic pension benefit they began receiving <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>upon retirement. <em>N.J. Educ. Ass\u2019n, supra, </em>412 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 215, 989 A.2d 282. <em>N.J. Educ. Ass\u2019n </em>involved a challenge by members of the Teachers\u2019 Pension and Annuity Fund to the State\u2019s method of funding the pension system. We affirmed the dismissal of the lawsuit, \u201cfinding that TPAF members, although entitled by law to the receipt of vested benefits upon retirement, possess no constitutionally-protected contract right to the particular level, manner or method of State funding provided in the statute.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 196, 989 A.2d 282. Although the contractual right to vested benefits on retirement was not directly at issue in <em>N.J. Educ. Ass\u2019n, </em>we recognized the \u201cnon-forfeitable rights\u201d language of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>43:80-9.5:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b298-5\">The general statutes recognize that vested members have \u201ca non-forfeitable right to receive benefits,\u201d which they define as \u201cmean[ing] that the benefits program, for any employee for whom the right has attached, cannot be reduced.\u201d N.J.S.A 43:3C-9.5(a), (b). However, they also reserve the State\u2019s right to alter the \u201cretirement systems and funds,\u201d and they deny that members have rights in the pension funds themselves____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b298-7\"><em>[Id. </em>at 200, 989 A.2d 282.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b298-8\">We also acknowledged the State\u2019s concession that section 9.5 created contract rights:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b298-9\">The fact that plaintiffs have no constitutionally-protected vested contract right in systematic funding of TPAF does not mean that the pension statutes confer no rights at all. There is a clear distinction between the right to receive pension benefits and the funding method adopted by the Legislature to assure that monies are available for the payment of such benefits. As to the former, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>43:3C-9.5(b) provides that members \u201cshall have a <em>non-forfeitable right to receive benefits </em>as provided under the laws governing the retirement system or fund upon the attainment of five years of service credit in the retirement system or fund____\u201d (emphasis added). The \u201cnon-forfeitable right\u201d means \u201cthat the benefits program, for any employee for whom the right has attached, cannot be reduced.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A </em>43:3C-9.5(a). <em>The essence of the right, acknowledged by the Attorney General, is the receipt of promised funds upon retirement, presumably at the rate fixed by law when such benefits were conferred. Indeed, the Attorney General concedes that in granting a non-forfeitable right to receive benefits, \"the Legislature intended to create enforceable contractual rights.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b298-12\"><em>[Id. </em>at 215, 989 A.2d 282 (first emphasis in original, second emphasis added) (footnote omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b298-13\">We noted that \u201c[a]s to this non-forfeitable right\u201d both parties agreed that TPAF would \u201ccontinue to have enough assets [to pay pension benefits] for at least the next thirty years____\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 215 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>n. 14, 989 A.2d 282. Hence, there had been \u201cno impairment\u2014much less a substantial one\u2014of plaintiffs\u2019 non-forfeitable right to receive accrued pension benefits.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>We concluded, however, that one Legislature could not bind a future Legislature to make an appropriation for the pension fund, without running afoul of the Appropriations Clause. <em>Id. </em>at 216, 989 A.2d 282.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-6\">In <em>N.J. Educ. Ass\u2019n, </em>the State\u2019s position on the contract question was consistent with opinions previously issued by the Office of the Attorney General and the Office of Legislative Services. As previously discussed, both opinions advised that <em>N.J.S.A. </em>43:3C-9.5 created a contractual right to pension benefits, and hence the State could not diminish vested pension benefits unless it could satisfy the constitutional standards under which the State may impair the obligation of a contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-7\">Based on the foregoing, we begin from the premise that the \u201cnon-forfeitable rights\u201d clause created a contractual right to receive, upon retirement, pension benefits at the rates in effect at the time the employee attained five years of service or at the time the non-forfeitable rights statute was passed, whichever was later. The issue in this case is whether, in enacting the non-forfeitable rights clause, the Legislature intended that cost of living increases be included in that contractual right.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-8\">The State argues that because COLAs are controlled by the Pension Adjustment Act, while each individual pension system or retirement plan is governed by its own separate legislation, the term \u201cbenefits\u201d in the non-forfeitable rights clause should be interpreted as applying only to the benefits provided by each separate pension/retirement system and not to COLAs.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-9\">The history of the pension statutes, including amendments to the Pension Adjustment Act, convinces us that COLAs are such an integral part of the pension system that the Legislature must have intended that they be included as part of the non-forfeitable right, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>43:3C-9.5, guaranteed in 1997. As previously discussed, while COLAs were originally funded by annual appropriations, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>and could be denied if the Legislature failed to make an appropriation, <em>N.J.S.A </em>43:3B-5, that system was abandoned decades ago.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-5\">Instead, through amendments adopted in the late 1980\u2019s and early 1990\u2019s, COLAs are funded in the same way that the regular pension benefits are funded, and COLAs are payable from each of the applicable pension funds. <em>See N.J.S.A. </em>43:16A-15.6 (L. 1989, c. 204, \u00a7 7); <em>N.J.S.A. </em>43:16A-15.7 (L. 1991, c. 511, \u00a7 3); <em>N.J.S.A. </em>43:15A-24.1 (L. 1990, c. 6, \u00a7 2). As plaintiff Ouslander points out, the Committee\u2019s Statement to Senate Bill No. 665, which was eventually codified at <em>N.J.S.A </em>43:15A-24.1, explains that the bill \u201cprovides that the COLA payment would be recognized as a liability of the system in the same manner as other retirement benefits are now liabilities.\u201d <em>Committee\u2019s Statement to Senate Bill No. 665, </em>at 1 (Feb. 5, 1990). Hence, we reject the State\u2019s argument that the reference, in section 9.5(b), to a retiree\u2019s nonforfeitable entitlement \u201cto receive benefits as provided under the laws governing the retirement system or fund\u201d refers only to benefits under the basic pension funds and not to COLAs.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> We conclude that the laws governing COLAs are part of the laws governing the retirement systems or funds.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-6\">The State also contends that when the non-forfeitable rights statute, <em>N.J.S.A </em>43:3C-9.5, was enacted, the Pension Adjustment Act, <em>N.J.SA. </em>43:3B-2, explicitly provided that COLAs could be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>decreased, revoked, or repealed \u201cas otherwise provided in this act.\u201d Consequently, the State argues, the Legislature would not logically have intended to include COLAs in the non-forfeitable rights provision because, as defined in section 2 of the Pension Adjustment Act, COLAs were always subject to change by amendment to the Adjustment Act, and the Legislature should not be deemed to have repealed section 2 by implication. The State thus argues that the non-forfeitable rights in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>43:3C-9.5 cannot be read to impliedly repeal <em>N.J.S.A </em>43:3B-2, and the State remained free to change future COLA rates by amending the Pension Adjustment Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-6\">We conclude this argument is based on a misreading of subsection 3B-2, which reads in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b301-7\">The monthly retirement allowance or pension originally granted to any retirant ... shall be adjusted in accordance with the provisions of this act provided, however, that:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b301-8\">Pension adjustments shall not be paid to retirants or beneficiaries who are not receiving their regular, full, monthly retirement allowances, pensions or survivor-ship benefits. <em>The adjustment granted under the provisions of this act shall be effective only on the first day of a month, shall be paid in monthly installments, and shall not be decreased, increased, revolted or repealed except </em>as <em>otherwise provided in this act. </em>No adjustment shall be due to a retirant or a beneficiary unless it constitutes a payment for an entire month; provided, however, that an adjustment shall be payable for the entire month in which the retirant or beneficiary dies.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b301-9\"><em>[.N.J.S.A. </em>43:3B-2 (emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b301-10\">We read the highlighted language, on which the State relies, as language of limitation. Specifically, the language limits changes in previously-granted COLAs to those specific situations allowed by the Pension Adjustment Act. For example, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>43:3B-3 sets forth the formula for calculating COLAs each year. Other provisions address the voluntary waiver of a right to increased retirement allowances, <em>N.J.S.A </em>43:3B-6, the cessation of payments if monies are not appropriated, <em>N.J.S.A </em>43:3B-5,<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> and the termi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>nation of COLA benefits if the Legislature provides for a \u201cblanket increase in original retirement allowances.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>43:3B-8. In context, we read section 2 as limiting the extent to which a COLA that was already awarded could be reduced, increased or revoked. Nothing in its language suggests that the Legislature could not, in separate legislation, contractually guarantee the right to receive a COLA. Hence, <em>N.J.S.A </em>43:3B-2 and <em>N.J.S.A. </em>43:3C-9.5 are compatible and, contrary to the State\u2019s argument, the latter does not implicitly \u201crepeal\u201d the former.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-5\">During the 1996 Pension Hearing, the participants discussed the basic pension benefits and COLAs as part of the same system. <em>See, e.g., Pension Hearing </em>at 55. Clearly the Legislature was well aware that COLAs were part of the various pension benefit plans. In fact, in discussing the various actuarial assumptions, Robert Baus, the State\u2019s actuarial consultant, observed that the inclusion of COLAs as a pre-funded part of the pension system, instead of as a separate pay-as-you-go item, was a critical issue: \u201cThe methodology is not driving the funding of this system. What is driving the funding of this system is the phasing in of the COLA. That is where the sensitivity of the cost is going to come in.\u201d <em>Pension Hearing </em>at 2, 77.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-6\">Moreover, in section 9.5(a), the Legislature specifically excepted health benefits from the non-forfeitable right it created. Given the historical context in which the section was enacted, we conclude that if the Legislature also intended to except COLAs, it would have specifically so stated. In construing a statutory provision that contains a specific exception, \u2018\u201cdoubts should be resolved in favor of the general provision rather than the exceptions.\u2019 \u201d <em>Prado v. State, </em>186 <em>N.J. </em>413, 426-27, 895 A.2d 1154 (2006) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b302-7\">The approach taken in the non-forfeitable rights statute enacted in 1997, was also consistent with ERISA, which has been construed as including COLAs, but not health benefits, as part of the accrued benefit to which an employee is entitled on retirement and which cannot, absent very limited circumstances, be decreased <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>after the employee retires. <em>See </em>29 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 1054(g)(1); <em>Williams v. Rohm &amp; Haas Pension Plan, </em>497 <em>F.</em>3d 710, 713 (7th Cir.2007), <em>cert. denied, </em>552 <em>U.S. </em>1276, 128 <em>S.Ct. </em>1657, 170 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>386 (2008).<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> \u201cTn contrast [to health benefits] the COLA [is] inseparably tied to the monthly retirement benefit as a means for maintaining the real value of that benefit. It [cannot], therefore, be said to be ancillary to the <em>benefit____Williams, supra, </em>497 F.3d at 713 (citation omitted, second and third alterations in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b303-8\">For all of these reasons, we conclude that the non-forfeitable right provision, which creates a contractual right to receive pension benefits, applies to COLAs. In the next section, we address the constitutional implications of that conclusion.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b303-9\">B. <em>The State and Federal Contract Clauses</em></p>\n<p id=\"b303-10\">As we recently recognized, while the State and Federal Constitutions protect legislative impairment of the obligations of contracts, that protection is not absolute:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b303-11\">The Federal and State Constitutions prohibit the passage of any \u201claw impairing the obligation of contracts.\u201d <em>U.S. Const, </em>art. I, \u00a7 10, cl. 1; <em>N.J. Const, </em>art. IV, \u00a7 7,113. \u201cThe two clauses are applied coextensively and provide the same protection.\u201d <em>N.J. </em>Educ. <em>Ass\u2019n v.

In addressing a claim for violation of the Contract Clause, the threshold inquiry is whether the law \u201coperated as a substantial impairment of a contractual relationship.\u201d <em>Allied Structural Steel Co. v. Spannaus, </em>438 <em>U.S. </em>234, 244, 98 <em>S.Ct </em>2716, 2722, 57 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>727, 736 (1978). In making that determination courts inquire whether: 1) \u201cthere is a contractual relationship\u201d; 2) the \u201cchange in law impairs that contractual relationship\u201d; and 3) \"the impairment is substantial.\u201d <em>Gen.

A governmental entity can always find a use for extra money, especially when taxes do not have to be raised. If a State could reduce its financial obligations whenever it wanted to spend the money for what it regarded as an important public purpose, the Contract Clause would provide no protection at all.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b304-10\"><em>[U.S. Trust Co., supra, </em>431 <em>U.S. </em>at 25-26, 97 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1519, 52 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 112 (footnote omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b304-11\">Further, in enacting a law that impairs contractual rights, \u201ca State is not free to impose a drastic impairment when an evident and more moderate course would serve its purposes equally well.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 31, 97 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1522, 52 L.Ed.2d at 115.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>As noted earlier, in evaluating a Contract Clause claim, a court must consider whether the challenged legislation \u201c(1) \u2018substantially impair[s] a contractual relationship,\u2019 (2) \u2018lack[s] a significant and legitimate public purpose,\u2019 and (3) is \u2018based upon unreasonable conditions and ... unrelated to appropriate governmental objectives.\u2019 \u201d <em>Farmers Mut.

Our Supreme Court has acknowledged \u201cthe serious fiscal issues that confront the State and that led to the passage of Chapter 78.\u201d <em>DePascale v. State, </em>211 <em>N.J. </em>40, 63, 47 A.3d 690 (2012). Moreover, the fiscal health of the pension system is of importance to both current and future retirees. Although, even without a current legislative appropriation, there is now money in the pension funds from which to pay COLAs, unless there is a long-term financial solution, the money in the pension funds may eventually run out.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-7\">In another context, the Court has interpreted <em>Spina </em>as endorsing the State\u2019s authority to modify pension benefits when needed to ensure the integrity of the pension fund. In disagreeing with a County\u2019s interpretation of a statute mandating uniform benefits for all employees, the Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b305-8\">While it has been held, moreover, that pension benefits can be modified in the interest of assuring the integrity of the pension system despite the compensatory aspect of their nature, it seems clear that they cannot be rescinded unilaterally when the underlying motivation is not preservation of the integrity of the benefit system but the erroneous belief that the benefits must be discontinued.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b305-9\"><em>[Gauer v. Essex Cnty. Div. of Welfare, </em>108 <em>N.J. </em>140, 150, 528 A.2d 1 (1987) (citing <em>Spina, supra, </em>41 <em>N.J. </em>at 402, 197 A.2d 169).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b305-10\">It may be argued that the Chapter 78 legislation was part of a reasonable, tripartite approach to the pension-funding problem, which required some contribution from all the stakeholders\u2014 additional pension contributions from current employees, the resumption of normal pension contributions by the State with additional contributions to pay down the shortfall, and the temporary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>cessation of COLAs for retirees. <em>See L. </em>2010, c. 1 \u00a7 38; <em>L. </em>2011, c. 78, \u00a7\u00a7 8, 10, 15, 25. It may further be argued that in temporarily suspending COLAs, the Legislature chose a \u201cmoderate course\u201d rather than the more drastic step of reducing the basic pension benefit for retirees. <em>See U.S. Trust Co., supra, </em>431 <em>U.S. </em>at 31, 97 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1522, 52 L.Ed.2d at 115.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-5\">On the other hand, plaintiffs contend that the State was partially responsible for the pension shortfall by skipping its pension contributions in prior years, and it should not be permitted to thus precipitate a pension crisis and then solve it at the expense of retirees. Plaintiffs also argue that the State has taken contradictory positions about the health of the pension systems, assuring this court in <em>N.J. Educ. Ass\u2019n </em>that the systems were sound enough to meet their obligations for the next thirty years despite the State\u2019s failure to make its contributions, and now telling us that \u201cthe pension system is teetering on the brink of collapse.\u201d <em>See </em>testimony of Senator Sweeney (a sponsor of Senate Bill No. 2937) before the Senate Budget and Appropriations Committee on June 16,2011.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-6\">In a recent submission, plaintiffs further point out that the State is proposing to renege on its promised contributions, through an Executive Order suspending a portion of the State\u2019s planned pension payments for this fiscal year and the next. <em>See </em>Executive Order 156 (May 20, 2014). Of course, in response, the State would no doubt contend that there were other reasons for the pension shortfall, including drastic investment losses caused by the financial \u201cmeltdown\u201d in the stock market, and that it intends to make as large a contribution as it can in the current and coming fiscal years, consistent with avoiding another general budget crisis.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-7\">As noted below, on this record, we cannot determine which side has the better arguments.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Further, even if we were to currently <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>view the suspension of COLAs as a moderate and reasonable step, that view might change in the future, depending on how long the suspension lasts, how quickly the cost of living increases, and whether, and to what extent, the State meets its own obligations under the tripartite approach it created.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-6\">While we note these issues, we agree with intervenor-plaintiffs and defendants, who both argue that, if we find section 9.5 created contractual rights, we cannot fairly decide the constitutional impairment-of-contract claim on this record. Because the trial court did not address the contract clause issue at all, and because a contract-impairment claim presents \u201ca mixed question of fact and law,\u201d <em>N.J. Educ. Ass\u2019n, supra, </em>412 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 206 n. 10, 989 A.2d 282, a remand is required to allow all sides to create a complete evidentiary record. Hence, we remand this case to the trial court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. If there are additional arguments the parties wish to raise on remand concerning the impairment-of-contracts issue, they may do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-7\">In remanding, we end with these observations. It is not the courts\u2019 role to run the pension systems. Our responsibility is to interpret and apply the Constitution in light of the evidence, and we will do so. But to a very great extent, the strength of the pension systems rests on policy choices made by the other two branches of government, and on their political will to preserve the systems and satisfy prior commitments made to public employees and retirees. <em>See Spina, supra, </em>41 <em>N.J. </em>at 404-05, 197 A.2d 169.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-8\">Affirmed in <em>DeLucia </em>(A-0632-12).

The PFRS statute, the source of the husband's pension in that case, was amended on December 20, 1989, to provide that COLAs were to be funded and paid for in the same manner as regular pension benefits. <em>See N.J.SA. </em>43:16A-15.6; <em>L. </em>1989 c. 204, \u00a7 7.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b301-11\"> This section was rendered obsolete when the pension statutes were amended to provide for pre-funding of COLAs instead of funding on a pay-as-you-go basis through annual appropriations.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b303-15\"> That approach may also have reflected Senator Inverso\u2019s observation, at the Pension Hearing, that the right to public pension benefits should be protected in the way private pension benefits are protected under ERISA. <em>See Pension-Hearing </em>at 69.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b303-16\"> We have intentionally refrained from addressing the scope of the class entitled to protection under section 9.5. As previously noted, a class has not been certified in this case, and the record contains minimal information about the individual plaintiffs. Those employed between 1997 and 2010 gave the State the benefit of their labor in exchange for the contractual protection section 9.5 provided, and those who retired during that time presumably did so in reliance on having contractually-guaranteed COLA benefits in retirement. The parties have not briefed, and we have not addressed, whether the necessary elements for the formation of a contract exist with respect to employees who retired before section 9.5 was enacted, and who had since July 1, 1970, been receiving COLAs. <em>L. </em>1969, <em>c. </em>169. That issue may be raised on remand.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b306-8\"> The summary judgment record the parties created was extremely limited, consisting of a few factual stipulations and an agreement that several actuarial reports and similar documents would be admitted in evidence. There were no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>expert depositions or other expert analysis of the evidence. By contrast, in <em>N.J. Educ. Ass\u2019n, </em>the trial court held a four-day bench trial on the contract impairment issue. <em>See N.J. Educ. Ass\u2019n, supra, </em>412 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 201, 989 A.2d 282.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
