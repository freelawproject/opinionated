Smith appeals from a judgment of conviction for second-degree robbery, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:15-1 (count one) and third-degree hindering apprehension, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:29-3(b)(4) (count two), entered following a jury trial. Prior to trial, defendant challenged the admissibility of the victim\u2019s out-of-court identification. His motion to suppress was denied. Following conviction, defendant was sentenced to a ten-year term, subject to the eighty-five percent period of parole ineligibility imposed by the No Early Release Act (\u00d1ERA), <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:43-7.2, on the second-degree robbery conviction, and a concurrent five-year term on the third-degree hindering apprehension conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-8\">On appeal, defendant argues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b603-9\">\n<em>POINT i</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b603-10\">THE TRIAL COURT SHOULD NOT HAVE ALLOWED THE SHOW[-JUP IDENTIFICATION TO BE USED AT TRIAL BECAUSE IT DID NOT SATISFY CONSTITUTIONAL STANDARDS OF RELIABILITY.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b603-11\">\n<em>POINT II</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b603-12\">THE PROSECUTOR\u2019S APPEAL TO THE JURY TO CONVICT SMITH IN ORDER TO PROTECT THEMSELVES AND THE COMMUNITY WAS IMPROPER AND HIGHLY PREJUDICIAL, (not raised below)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b603-13\">\n<em>POINT III</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b603-14\">OFFICER MARTINA IMPROPERLY PROVIDED LAY OPINION TESTIMONY ON AN ISSUE WHICH WAS NOT BEYOND THE KEN OF THE AVERAGE JUROR, (not raised below)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b603-15\">Following our review, we conclude the motion judge erred in denying defendant\u2019s motion to suppress the identification testimony. Accordingly, we reverse the suppression order, vacate his conviction and remand for further proceedings, including a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number>These facts are taken from the pre-trial <em>Wade</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>hearing. The State presented the testimony of Plainfield Police Officers Edward Jackson and Charles Martina. The defense called the victim, Josephine DiMeglio.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-5\">Officer Jackson testified he responded to a call received at approximately 10:30 p.m., on July 10, 2009, from DiMeglio who was assaulted and robbed as she walked toward her home. Specifically, DiMeglio was suddenly attacked from behind by a man trying to snatch her purse. A struggle ensued, during which the assailant slapped DiMeglio, injuring her and causing her to fall to the ground. The scuffle continued briefly as DiMeglio resisted, but ultimately she relaxed her grip and the assailant fled with her purse.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-6\">DiMeglio called 9-1-1. Then, approximately ten minutes after the robbery, DiMeglio described her attacker to Officer Jackson as \u201ca tall black male\u201d wearing \u201cjeans and a dark shirt.\u201d She also stated the attacker wore a brown windbreaker. Officer Jackson confirmed on cross-examination the description was \u201c[j]ust a tall black male and a clothing description.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b604-7\">Officer Jackson radioed the description and within ten minutes, Officer Martina, who was canvassing the area, encountered defendant four blocks away sitting in a park with others. Officer Martina believed defendant matched the radioed description and he informed Officer Jackson, who in turn told DiMeglio \u201cwe might have someone fitting the description----\u201d Officer Jackson \u201casked her if she can take a ride [to] see if she can make a positive ID on the person.\u201d Officer Jackson brought DiMeglio to the park. He recalled defendant was standing next to Officer Martina. Without hesitation, DiMeglio identified defendant as her assailant.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-10\">After DiMeglio viewed defendant at the show-up, she provided her written statement to police. In that statement, DiMeglio <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number>described her attacker as: \u201cAfro-American, 6feet [sic] tall, 5-8, brown shirt, cap and black pants.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b605-5\">Officer Martina also testified. He recalled the description of DiMeglio\u2019s assailant radioed from Officer Jackson was \u201c[a] black male, black shirt, brown windbreaker, over six feet tall.\u201d As he drove toward the park he aimed his spotlight on \u201ca group of people, [and an] individual matching the description[ ] immediately looked startled and scared.\u201d Defendant was among those in the group. He wore a black hoodie and brown pants; he did not have a windbreaker. Officer Martina acknowledged the description he received was not the most detailed and did not include the alleged assailant\u2019s age, the presence or absence of facial hair, or whether he was bald.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-6\">When asked by Officer Martina, defendant gave his name as \u201cThomas J. Smith.\u201d Once Officer Martina was told DiMeglio identified defendant as her attacker, he was arrested and charged with second-degree robbery and third-degree hindering apprehension.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-7\">When arrested, defendant possessed a $5 bill, $1.75 in change, a silver chain, four keys, two shoestrings, a driver\u2019s license, three cell phone batteries, a cell phone, and a brown cap. DiMeglio\u2019s later-provided police statement listed the following as stolen: \u201ca gold canvas bag\u201d containing her wallet, two money orders, $100 cash, and her identification cards. None of these effects were found on defendant\u2019s person or recovered.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-8\">Defendant called DiMeglio during the hearing. She described the incident, confirming an assailant approached her from behind and grabbed her purse, but she would not let go. She was \u201cshocked\u201d and \u201cstarted to scream,\u201d because she did not want the assailant to take her property. The attacker slapped DiMeglio on her right cheek, bruising her lip and causing her to fall. She was still holding the leash of her bag when the assailant dragged her in an effort to get her to release her grip. She ultimately let go and he fled with her purse. DiMeglio admitted the events unfolded \u201cvery quickly.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b606-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>DiMeglio noted the attack took place at nighttime, but there was one streetlight across the street. Defense counsel asked her to describe the most prominent details she recalled about her attacker. For the first time, DiMeglio stated her assailant \u201cwas smoking a cigar,\u201d saying he had a \u201cBlack and Mild in his mouth.\u201d She explained he had hair, although noting defendant as he sat in the courtroom was bald. The remaining details of the attacker\u2019s description included that he \u201cwas tall,\u201d had a scar on his mouth, \u201ca cap on his head,\u201d and wore \u201csomething black and something brown[.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b606-5\">DiMeglio was also questioned about the show-up. When she was taken to the park, she was told \u201cthey had apprehended him and he was across the street in the park, ... [and they wanted her] to take a look at him and to see if he was the man that mugged [her].\u201d DiMeglio recalled a man standing between two police officers. She immediately recognized his face. When asked \u201c[w]hat was the greatest feature that confirmed to you this was the same man[,]\u201d she stated: \u201c[h]e had the same clothes on when he robbed me and it was him. He had the black jacket [and] brown pants. I recognized his face when he mugged me. It was his features.\u201d Pressed to reveal the identifying features of her attacker, DiMeglio stated: \u201cIt was his eyes----They were mean.\u201d When questioned by the State, DiMeglio stated she was one \u201c[h]undred percent sure\u201d defendant was her attacker.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-8\">Considering defendant\u2019s motion to suppress DiMeglio\u2019s out-of-court identification, the motion judge found the police officers\u2019 testimony credible in establishing the events. Further, the motion judge found DiMeglio \u201cextremely credible\u201d and \u201cextremely accurate.\u201d Despite the suggestiveness of the procedure, the motion judge determined DiMeglio\u2019s identification was reliable because she \u201chad a close physical one-on-one contact with ... defendant and had ample opportunity to view him\u201d; her account was detailed suggesting she \u201cpaid attention to the details of her assailant\u201d; \u201cthe show[-]up occurred almost immediately after the incident and defendant was wearing similar clothes and was similar in appear-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>anee to [DiMeglio\u2019s] original description ... made about ten minutes earlier\u201d; DiMeglio was able to identity defendant, with certainty, a finding supported by the officers\u2019 testimony about the immediacy of her recognition of defendant and her own testimony that she was \u201cone hundred percent\u201d certain defendant was her assailant; and she provided the identification proximate to the attack, \u201cshortly after the incident, approximately ten minutes[,]\u201d and only three or four blocks from the scene of the crime. Defendant\u2019s motion to suppress the identification was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-6\">The case was tried over two days by another Law Division judge. Defendant attacked the State\u2019s identification evidence. We note DiMeglio\u2019s trial testimony varied in many significant respects from her testimony at the <em>Wade </em>hearing. DiMeglio stated her attacker approached her not from behind, but \u201csideways,\u201d from her left side. She stated she saw the assailant\u2019s face, first as she walked along the street then the entire time he tugged at her purse until he successfully dislodged her grip and ran off. She identified two working streetlights in the area and recalled her description of the attacker as an \u201cAfro-American male, tall ... wearing [a] black hoodie and brown pants.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b607-7\">At trial the 9-1-1 tape was played. During her call, DiMeglio told the operator it was dark, but she described the man as wearing a black shirt, a brownish windbreaker and black pants. When asked about the variations of her descriptions of the assailant\u2019s clothing from her initial 9-1-1 call to trial, DiMeglio testified she was initially \u201cshaken up\u201d and \u201cdidn\u2019t really get to match everything, put everything together[.]\u201d DiMeglio did not describe any specific facial or physical features of her attacker. In her trial testimony, DiMeglio never mentioned the attacker was wearing a cap; insisted he had no facial hair; and stated defendant could not have had a scar on his mouth.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-8\">In recounting the show-up, DiMeglio testified she was told police had someone matching the description of her attacker. They drove her to the park. She viewed the man standing between two police officers and she identified him as her attacker. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number>DiMeglio stated she was \u201ca thousand percent sure\u201d because she remembered his face.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-5\">On cross-examination, DiMeglio admitted the events occurred \u201cquiek[ly],\u201d taking \u201cten minutes.\u201d She stated she was extremely scared after her assailant struck her and it was dark. She also acknowledged that when she described her attacker to police she stated only that he was tall, black and wore a black shirt and blue jeans. Next, in giving her statement to police, she described the assailant as 5'8\" or 6' and wearing a brown cap, black pants and brown shirt.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-6\">The jury returned a guilty verdict on both charges. Defendant appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-7\">The Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment prohibits the admission of an unreliable out-of-court identification, which resulted from impermissibly suggestive procedures. <em>Manson v. Brathwaite, </em>432 <em>U.S. </em>98, 106, 97 <em>S.Ct. </em>2243, 2249, 53 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>140, 149 (1977); <em>see also United States v. Wade, </em>388 <em>U.S. </em>218, 227-32, 87 <em>S.Ct. </em>1926, 1932-35, 18 L.Ed.2d 1149, 1157-60 (1967) (holding pretrial identification is a critical juncture in the course of a criminal prosecution). On one hand, eyewitness evidence is \u201cinherently suspect\u201d; however, on the other, it is \u201cequally well recognized that in criminal actions an eyewitness\u2019s identification may be the most crucial evidence.\u201d <em>State v. Madison, </em>109 <em>N.J. </em>223, 232, 536 A.2d 254 (1988) (citation omitted), <em>abrogated in part by State v. Henderson, </em>208 <em>N.J. </em>208, 27 A.3d 872 (2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b608-8\">A sea change has recently occurred in the methodology for examining suggestive police identification procedures and ascertaining the reliability of resulting out-of-court identifications. <em>See Henderson, supra, </em>208 <em>N.J. </em>at 288-99, 27 A.3d 872; <em>State v. Chen, 208 N.J. </em>307, 327, 27 A.3d 930 (2011). Historically, courts followed the United States Supreme Court\u2019s two-part test to determine the admissibility of an eyewitness\u2019s out-of-court photographic identification, set forth in <em>Manson v. Brathwaite, </em>432 <em>U.S. </em>98, 97 <em>S.Ct. </em>2243, 53 L.Ed.2d 140 (1977), which was adopted by the New <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>Jersey Supreme Court in <em>State v. Madison, </em>109 <em>N.J. </em>223, 536 A.2d 254 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b609-6\">In <em>Manson, </em>the Highest Court expounded on the test initially identified in <em>Simmons v. United States, </em>390 <em>U.S. </em>377, 88 <em>S.Ct. </em>967, 19 L.Ed.2d 1247 (1968), which requires a court to determine whether the out-of-court photographic identification procedures used were impermissibly suggestive. <em>Manson, supra, </em>432 <em>U.S. </em>at 114, 97 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2253, 53 L.Ed.2d at 154. If so, the court then must examine whether the objectionable procedure resulted in \u201ca very substantial likelihood of irreparable misidentification.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 116, 97 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2254, 53 L.Ed.2d at 155. When examining a challenge to the admissibility of identification testimony, a court must assess whether the impermissibly suggestive procedures used by law enforcement prejudicially affected the identification, by weighing five factors to \u201c \u2018determine whether ... sufficient indicia of reliability\u2019 \u201d would \u201c \u2018outweigh the \u201ccorrupting effect of the suggestive identification itself.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>Madison, supra, </em>109 <em>N.J. </em>at 239, 536 A.2d 254 (quoting <em>State v. Ford, </em>79 <em>N.J. </em>136, 137, 398 A.2d 95 (1979) (quoting <em>Manson, supra, </em>432 <em>U.S. </em>at 114, 97 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2253, 53 L.Ed.2d at 154)). These factors \u201cinclude the opportunity of the witness to view the criminal at the time of the crime, the witness\u2019 degree of attention, the accuracy of his prior description of the criminal, the level of certainty demonstrated at the confrontation, and the time between the crime and the confrontation.\u201d <em>Manson, supra, </em>432 <em>U.S. </em>at 114, 97 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2253, 53 L.Ed.2d at 154.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-7\">Underscoring \u201cthat reliability is the linchpin in determining the admissibility of identification testimony!,]\u201d <em>Chen, supra, </em>208 <em>N.J. </em>at 318, 27 A.3d 930 (quoting <em>Manson, </em>432 <em>U.S. </em>at 114, 97 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2253, 53 L.Ed.2d at 154), we note any reliability determination must be made after assessing \u201cthe totality of the circumstances adduced in the particular case.\u201d <em>Madison, supra, </em>109 <em>N.J. </em>at 233, 536 A.2d 254 (citing <em>Neil v. Biggers, </em>409 <em>U.S. </em>188, 199, 93 <em>S.Ct. </em>375, 382, 34 L.Ed.2d 401, 411 (1972)).</p>\n<p id=\"b610-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>After <em>Madison, </em>the Court again considered eyewitness identification challenges in <em>State v. Delgado, </em>188 <em>N.J. </em>48, 902 A.2d 888 (2006). Noting \u201c[m]isidentifieation is widely recognized as the single greatest cause of wrongful convictions in this eountry[,]\u201d <em>id. </em>at 60, 902 A.2d 888, the Court chose to exercise its supervisory powers, granted by Article VI, Section 2, Paragraph 3 of the New Jersey Constitution, \u201cto require, as a condition to the admissibility of out-of-court identifications, that the police record, to the extent feasible, the dialogue between the witnesses and police during an identification procedure.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 51, 902 A.2d 888. The Court held the admissibility of out-of-court identifications was conditioned upon the preparation of</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b610-5\">a written record detailing the out-of-court identification procedure, including the place where the procedure was conducted, the dialogue between the witness and the interlocutor, and the results. Preserving the words exchanged between the witness and the officer conducting the identification procedure may be as important as preserving either a picture of a live lineup or a photographic array. When feasible, a verbatim account of any exchange between the law enforcement officer and witness should be reduced to writing. When not feasible, a detailed summary of the identification should be prepared.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b610-6\">[Id. at 63, 902 A.2d 888.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b610-7\">By that time, \u201c[t]he State\u2019s Attorney General ha[d] ... recognized that eyewitness identification \u2018evidence is not foolproof,\u2019 and made New Jersey the first state to adopt the United States Department of Justice\u2019s procedural recommendations to increase reliability in photo and live lineups.\u201d <em>State v. Romero, </em>191 <em>N.J. </em>59, 74, 922 A.2d 693 (2007) (citing Letter from Attorney General John J. Farmer, Jr., to All County Prosecutors et al., at 1 (Apr. 18, 2001) (accompanying <em>Attorney General Guidelines for Preparing and Conducting Photo and Live Lineup Identification Procedures )).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b610-8\">The Supreme Court revisited and comprehensively considered this thorny issue in <em>State v. Henderson, </em>208 <em>N.J. </em>208, 27 A.3d 872 (2011), which established a more detailed framework to examine the admissibility of out-of-court identification testimony, provide new guidelines to reduce the possibility of misidentification, offer a more adequate measure for reliability, and deter potential police <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>misconduct. <em>Id. </em>at 288-99, 27 A.3d 872. However, this case was decided before <em>Henderson\u2019s </em>new rule of law took effect and remains subject to the prior rubric of <em>Manson/Madison.</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b611-6\">Following our review, we conclude the motion judge erroneously found factual support satisfying the <em>Manson/Madison </em>factors and determined DiMeglio\u2019s out-of-court identification was reliable and admissible at defendant\u2019s trial. We determine the evidence of record insufficient to overcome the fact that suggestive identification procedures result in a \u201cvery substantial likelihood of irreparable misidentification.\u201d <em>Manson, </em>432 <em>U.S. </em>at 116, 97 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2254, 53 <em>L.Ed.</em>2d at 155. Accordingly the out-of-court identification should have been suppressed.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-7\">Show-up procedures used to illicit identification are suggestive. <em>See State v. Herrera, </em>187 <em>N.J. </em>493, 504, 902 A.2d 177 (2006) (recognizing that \u201cone-on-one show[-]ups are inherently suggestive[,]\u201d because \u201cthe victim can only choose from one person, and, generally, that person is in police custody\u201d). However, indicia of reliability results because the on or near-the-scene identification is made close in time to the event. <em>State v. Wilkerson, </em>60 <em>N.J. </em>452, 461, 291 A.2d 8 (1972). The procedure also facilitates efficient police work; consequently, the tool has been found permissible. <em>Ibid. </em>Standing alone, a show-up is not considered impermissibly suggestive. <em>Herrera, supra, </em>187 <em>N.J. </em>at 504, 902 A.2d 177. <em>See also State v. Wilson, </em>362 <em>N.J.Super. </em>319, 327, 827 A.2d 1143 (App.Div.) (\u201cITjhere is no question that there was suggestiveness present because the defendant was identified while seated and handcuffed in the back of a police car. However, such suggestive circumstances did not render the identification procedure <em>per se </em>improper and unconstitutional.\u201d), <em>certif. denied, </em>178 <em>N.J. </em>250, 837 A.2d 1092 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b612-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>Nevertheless, show-up procedures must be scrutinized to assure police conduct, direct and inadvertent, does not impermissibly suggest a result to the witness. In this matter, defendant challenged the procedure used, asserting police failed to satisfactorily comply with the <em>Delgado </em>recording requirements. The motion judge rejected this argument and found the identification procedures were properly executed, such that they \u201cdid not result in a substantial likelihood of irreparable misidentification.\u201d We cannot agree with such an assessment.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-5\">The only written record memorializing the show-up procedure is a brief mention in the July 9, 2010 police incident report:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b612-6\">At that time [Officer] Martina detained the possible suspect until I was able to drive the victim to the suspect to see if she could make a positive [identification] on this possible suspect. Once I got to the location of the possible suspect, ... DiMeglio related right away that he was the one who robbed her.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b612-7\">The limited comments recorded by police include DiMeglio\u2019s identification, but omit what she was told, her response, or a statement of the specific procedures employed to effectuate the show-up.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-8\">Officer Jackson testified at the <em>Wade </em>hearing that after Officer Martina encountered defendant, he \u201ctold the victim that [the officers] might have someone fitting the description and ... asked her if she can take a ride with [him] so\u2014see if she can make a positive [identification] on the person.\u201d However, DiMeglio stated she was told by police \u201cthey had apprehended [her assailant] and he was across the street in the park, and for me to take a look at him and to see if he was the man that mugged me.\u201d There is a difference in these two accounts, which displays exactly why a near-contemporaneous record of the procedure is required. Further, there is no evidence police instructed DiMeglio that the person located may not be her attacker; to the contrary the suggestion was the opposite, as she was told a suspect was apprehended.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-9\">Also critical to assessing suggestibility is a description of the manner in which defendant was detained. Here, it was learned at the <em>Wade </em>hearing uniformed police officers flanked defendant. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>Although not handcuffed, defendant was separated from the others to focus DiMeglio\u2019s observation toward him alone.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-6\">We conclude the meagerness of detail recorded in this incident report does not fulfill <em>Delgado\u2019s </em>clear requirements. <em>Delgado, supra, </em>188 <em>N.J. </em>at 63, 902 A.2d 888 (conditioning admissibility of out-of-court identifications on creation of a written record detailing \u201cthe out-of-court identification procedure\u201d). <em>See also Chen, supra, </em>208 <em>N.J. </em>at 320, 27 A.3d 930 (holding <em>Delgado </em>mandates a reasonable, contemporaneous and detailed account of identification procedure); <em>State v. Adams, </em>194 <em>N.J. </em>186, 202-03, 943 A.2d 851 (2008) (same). In mandating the specific procedures to be followed, the Court stressed, \u201c[t]he importance of recording the details of what occurred at an out-of-court identification flows from our understanding of the frailty of human memory and the inherent danger of misidentification.\u201d <em>Delgado, supra, </em>188 <em>N.J. </em>at 60, 902 A.2d 888. The record requirement protects a defendant\u2019s rights allowing examination of whether the procedure was impermissibly suggestive.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-7\">We next examine whether the identification was reliable. We conclude it was not sufficiently reliable and determine the motion judge\u2019s findings, articulated in support of the <em>Manson/Madison </em>factors, was flawed.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-8\">The judge found DiMeglio\u2019s identification reliable because: (1) DiMeglio \u201chad a close physical one-on-one contact with ... defendant and had ample opportunity to view him\u201d; (2) DiMeglio\u2019s description of the incident was detailed and she \u201cpaid attention to the details of her assailant\u201d; (3) \u201cthe show[-]up occurred almost immediately after the incident[,] defendant was wearing similar clothes[,] and was similar in appearance to [DiMeglio\u2019s] original description that she had made about ten minutes earlier\u201d; (4) DiMeglio identified defendant with \u201cone hundred percent\u201d certainty; and (5) the identification was made \u201cshortly after the incident, approximately ten minutes[,]\u201d and only three or four blocks from the scene of the crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>Despite DiMeglio\u2019s insistence she viewed her assailant before and throughout the attack, making her one-hundred and, later, one thousand percent certain defendant mugged her, the only consistent descriptive features given of the man who stole her purse was he was \u201ctall\u201d and \u201cblack.\u201d As to the attacker\u2019s height, DiMeglio stated her assailant was \u201ctall\u201d or \u201c5'8\" to 6'.\u201d It was Officer Martina, not DiMeglio, who suggested he remembered the radio call mentioning the suspect was \u201cover six feet.\u201d We note defendant stands 6'4\" tall, making him at least four and as much as eight inches taller than DiMeglio\u2019s described attacker. Other details provided by DiMeglio were also vague and varied. When the 9-1-1 operator asked her to describe her attacker, DiMeglio first stated it was dark and mentioned he wore a black shirt, black pants, and a brownish windbreaker. That clothing description changed ten minutes later when she first spoke to police and gave a description that included \u201cblue jeans\u201d and a \u201cdark shirt.\u201d After DiMeglio observed defendant in the park standing between the police officers, she adjusted her description to a \u201cbrown shirt,\u201d \u201cblack pants,\u201d and a \u201ccap.\u201d During the <em>Wade </em>hearing, the clothing description was muddled, as DiMeglio stated the mugger wore \u201csomething black and something brown,\u201d and she added he wore a cap on his head. When pressed by defense counsel, DiMeglio, for the first time, stated the attacker \u201cwas smoking a cigar\u201d\u2014he had a \u201cBlack and Mild in his mouth\u201d; had hair, although noting defendant as he sat in the courtroom was bald; had a sear on his mouth; and had \u201cmean\u201d eyes. By the time of trial, DiMeglio\u2019s description again changed and she related exactly what defendant wore when arrested, a black hoodie and brown pants.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-5\">The motion judge\u2019s finding that DiMeglio \u201cpaid attention to the details of her assailant\u201d and offered an accurate description of her attacker is unfounded. Not only was the clothing description wrong, defendant also had no scar on his face or mouth and was bald.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-6\">Further, there are several facts not discussed by the motion judge that impact the accuracy of DiMeglio\u2019s identification and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>undermine any finding of reliability. These include the darkness of the area, the suddenness of the attack, and the resulting stress of the assault. <em>See Henderson, supra, </em>208 <em>N.J. </em>at 247, 27 A.3d 872 (citing Gary L. Wells, <em>Applied Eyewitness-Testimony Research: System and Estimator Variables, 36 J. Personality &amp; Soc. Pyschol. </em>1546, 1546 (1978)) (noting \u201cdistance, lighting, or stress\u201d are variables capable of \u201caffect[ing] and diluting] memory and leading] to misidentifications\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b615-6\">First, the area of the attack was dark. DiMeglio admitted it was after nightfall and there was only one streetlight in the area, located across the street. When she spoke to the 9-1-1 operator she stated she could describe the attacker\u2019s clothing, but offered no distinguishing features other than height and race. Interestingly, the only distinguishing features DiMeglio eventually revealed about her attacker were he had hair and a scar; neither of which corresponded with defendant\u2019s appearance.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-7\">Second, the attack was sudden, from behind, and was of brief duration. DiMeglio herself admitted, the assault was \u201c[n]ot too long,\u201d \u201cit happened actually very quickly,\u201d and she was \u201cshocked\u201d and \u201c[sjcared.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b615-8\">Another significant issue not addressed by the motion judge is the Court\u2019s prior discussions addressing \u201ccross-racial impairment,\u201d that is, difficulty in \u201cidentifying members of another race[,]\u201d which is \u201cstrongest when white witnesses attempt to recognize black subjects.\u201d <em>State v. Cromedy, </em>158 <em>N.J. </em>112, 120-21, 727 A.2d 457 (1999) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). <em>See also Romero, supra, </em>191 <em>N.J. </em>at 69, 922 A.2d 693 (discussing \u201cthe convincing social science data demonstrating the potential unreliability of cross-racial identifications of African-American defendants specifically\u201d). \u201cResearch suggests that people generally are better able to identify persons who resemble themselves or who share familiar physical characteristics.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 72-73, 922 A.2d 693 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b615-9\">The vagueness and inaccuracy of DiMeglio\u2019s description illustrates this difficulty and casts doubt on her ability to perceive and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>describe her attacker. Rather than evaluate the inconsistencies evinced by the facts, the motion judge simply honed in on DiMeglio\u2019s statement she saw her attacker\u2019s face and was certain it was defendant. DiMeglio\u2019s confidence in her identification and the temporal proximity of the show-up cannot sufficiently mitigate against the other factors that weigh in favor of a finding of unreliability. <em>See Adams, supra, </em>194 <em>N.J. </em>at 204, 943 A.2d 851.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-5\">The judge also erred in finding DiMeglio accurately described defendant\u2019s clothing. In fact, the various clothing descriptions offered by DiMeglio were inconsistent and did not coincide with defendant\u2019s appearance on the night of the robbery. Defendant\u2019s pants were brown not black or blue jeans. Further, he wore a black hooded sweatshirt not a brown windbreaker. It cannot be overlooked that DiMeglio modified her description of defendant\u2019s clothing over time. After she saw him at the park, she changed the color of his pants. During the Wade hearing, the black pants and brown windbreaker morphed to \u201csomething black and something brown.\u201d This changed again at trial and she described her attacker wearing exactly what defendant wore when he was stopped.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-6\">We reject the State\u2019s notion these are \u201c[sjmall differences\u201d that are \u201cimmaterial.\u201d The clothing description was the only specific detail DiMeglio offered to describe the assailant. Yet, DiMeglio\u2019s shifting descriptions show she either did not initially perceive or could not recall what her attacker wore. She continued to add details as time passed and those details, inexplicably, corresponded with other evidence the State presented on this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-7\">While we agree DiMeglio described the events of the attack, we find no support for the motion judge\u2019s finding she was able to give a \u201cdetailed description\u201d of her attacker. Because of the importance of the identification testimony and the dearth of corroborating evidence to support reliability of her identification, the trial judge had an obligation to scrutinize the facts. <em>See Romero, supra, </em>191 <em>N.J. </em>at 75, 922 A.2d 693 (\u201cWe believe that particular care need be taken in respect of this powerful evidence\u2014the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>eyewitness.\u201d). Instead, the judge\u2019s critical findings are generally unsupported. We find unfounded the judge\u2019s determination that defendant \u201cwas wearing similar clothes and was similar in appearance [to] [DiMeglio\u2019s] original description....\u201d The only description DiMeglio gave of the features of her attacker that matched defendant was his race and an approximate, yet inaccurate, height range. DiMeglio\u2019s suggestion she had ample time to view her assailant is belied by the fact that the only distinguishing feature she accurately offered was the color of his skin.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-5\">Based on our review of the totality of the circumstances presented in this record, we conclude DiMeglio\u2019s show-up identification was unreliable. We find no basis to conclude she had an independent recollection of his appearance. In light of DiMeglio\u2019s inability to identify the features of her attacker except that he was \u201ca tall black male,\u201d together with the suggestive show-up procedures, we conclude when DiMeglio viewed defendant, a tall black man, she concluded he assaulted her. Accordingly, the out-of-court identification is inadmissible. <em>See Cherry, supra, </em>289 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 517-18, 674 A.2d 589.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-6\">The denial of defendant\u2019s suppression motion is reversed. Defendant\u2019s conviction is vacated. Retrial is subject to any determination on the sufficiency of the State\u2019s remaining evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-7\">We briefly address the two remaining challenges raised on appeal, in an effort to avoid possible repetition of error in the event of a retrial. First, we reject defendant\u2019s claim of prosecutorial misconduct and do not agree the State\u2019s summation equated to an impermissible call to arms. <em>See State v. Buscham, </em>360 <em>N.J.Super. </em>346, 364-65, 823 A.2d 71 (App.Div.2003) (finding prosecutor\u2019s express plea to jury \u201cto protect this child\u201d was improper). Nor can it be said to amount to a plea to the jury to protect members of a specified group. <em>See State v. Acker, </em>265 <em>N.J.Super. </em>351, 356, 627 A.2d 170 (App.Div.1993) (deeming inappropriate \u201cthe prosecutor\u2019s argument that it was the function of the jury to protect young victims of alleged sexual offenses as a group\u201d and the implication jurors would violate their oaths by failing to convict <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>the defendant), <em>certif. denied, </em>134 <em>N.J. </em>485, 634 A.2d 530 (1993). There was no trial objection. When considering the \u201cfair import\u201d of the summation in its entirety, <em>State v. Jackson, </em>211 <em>N.J. </em>394, 409, 48 A.3d 1059 the cited statement was not \u201cso egregious that it deprived ... defendant of a fair trial,\u201d <em>State v. Frost, </em>158 <em>N.J. </em>76, 83, 727 A.2d 1 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b618-5\">Finally, defendant argues Officer Martina\u2019s testimony that suspects \u201cnormally get rid of [the proceeds of a crime] so they can\u2019t be tied to the crime\u201d was inadmissible lay opinion. Again, no objection followed this testimony. Despite the lack of objection, we conclude it was error to admit that statement and the error was \u201cclearly capable of producing an unjust result.\u201d <em>R. </em>2:10-2.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-6\">\u201cLay opinion testimony ... can only be admitted if it falls within the narrow bounds of testimony that is based on the perception of the witness and that will assist the jury in performing its function.\u201d <em>State v. McLean, </em>205 <em>N.J. </em>438, 456, 16 A.3d 332 (2011). \u201c[A] lay witness must have actual knowledge, acquired through his or her senses, of the matter to which he or she testifies.\u201d <em>State v. LaBrutto, </em>114 <em>N.J. </em>187, 197, 553 A.2d 335 (1989). Further, lay opinion \u201cis limited to testimony that will assist the trier of fact either by helping to explain the witness\u2019s testimony or by shedding light on the determination of a disputed factual issue.\u201d <em>McLean, supra, </em>205 <em>N.J. </em>at 458, 16 A.3d 332.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-7\">Although New Jersey courts have permitted police officers to testify as lay witnesses, <em>LaBrutto, supra, </em>114 <em>N.J. </em>at 198, 553 A.2d 335, \u201c[t]he Rule does not permit a witness to offer a lay opinion on a matter \u2018not within [the witness\u2019s] direct ken ... and as to which the jury is as competent as he [or she] to form a conclusion[.]\u2019 \u201d <em>McLean, supra, </em>205 <em>N.J. </em>at 459, 16 A.3d 332 (alterations in original) (quoting <em>Brindley v. Firemen\u2019s Ins. Co., </em>35 <em>N.J.Super. </em>1, 8, 113 A.2d 53 (App.Div.1953)).</p>\n<p id=\"b618-8\">Here, Officer Martina was not relating what he observed or perceived. <em>See N.J.R.E. </em>701. Rather, he offered what amounted to an expert opinion interpreting facts for the jury bearing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>directly on defendant\u2019s guilt. The statement from a lay witness impermissibly intruded on the jury\u2019s function and is not admissible without an appropriate expert foundation. <em>See McLean, supra, </em>205 <em>N.J. </em>at 463, 16 A.3d 332.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-6\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b604-11\"> <em>United States v.
