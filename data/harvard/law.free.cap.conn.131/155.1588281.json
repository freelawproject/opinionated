Duffy (deceased) doing business as Frank P. Duffy\u201d in response to their orders in connection with their undertaking business, that the above was the balance due on the running account, and that on April 18, 1942, the defendant expressly agreed in writing to \u201cpay the full amount as soon as I sell the house,\u201d having reference to her homestead in New Britain. The defendant\u2019s answer was a general denial. The court rendered judgment for the plaintiff for the above amount and the defendant has appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-9\">In this court the plaintiff has urged that the court\u2019s finding of liability on the part of the defendant can be sustained upon any or all of these grounds: (1) she is a surviving partner or member of a joint adventure; (2) the articles went \u201cfor the joint benefit\u201d of herself and her husband within \u00a7 5155 of the General Statutes; and (3) she expressly promised on April 18, 1942, to pay the debt. The court\u2019s conclusions make clear that its judgment was predicated solely upon this last ground. The facts found are insufficient to support a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>conclusion of liability on the first ground. The same is true as to the second. See <em>Dubow </em>v. <em>Gottinello, </em>111 Conn. 306, 311, 149 Atl. 768. The judgment for the plaintiff cannot be sustained on the third ground. This is so because there was no consideration for the defendant\u2019s promise. Something given before a promise is made, and therefore without reference to it, particularly if given to another than the promisor, does not constitute legal consideration. 1 Williston, Contracts (Rev.
