The defendant owns a factory and a considerable tract of land on the east side of Windsor Street in Hartford. The street line in front of the fac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>tory is seven feet from the curb, and a four-foot sidewalk is located midway between the two. The employees\u2019 entrance is in the north wall of the factory, about fifty feet east of the curb. It opens on an approach which extends westerly to Windsor Street. Flodin, in common with others, was required to use this approach and side entrance in going to and returning from work.- These could not be reached except by passing over the sidewalk in front of the defendant\u2019s premises and this use of that sidewalk by Flodin was contemplated by the defendant. On February 11, 1943, the streets of Hartford were in a generally icy and slippery condition, and this was true of the sidewalk in front of the defendant\u2019s factory. Flodin\u2019s work began at 7 o\u2019clock. At about 6:45 that morning, while on his way to work, Flodin slipped, fell and was injured on the public sidewalk directly in front of his employer\u2019s factory. The commissioner, and the Superior Court on appeal, concluded that the risks assumed by him were those common to the traveling public and not those arising out of his employment or as incidental thereto, and that the accident did not arise out of and in the course of his employment. The appeal was dismissed and the award for the defendant affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-4\">The plaintiffs do not dispute the general principle, well established in this state, that \u201cemployees whose area of employment is within defined limits, are not regarded as in the course of their employment while going to and returning from work upon the public highways; nor do the risks incidental to travel on such highways ordinarily arise out of their employment.\u201d <em>Lake </em>v. <em>Bridgeport, </em>102 Conn. 337, 342, 128 Atl. 782. They claim, in substance, that since the defendant presumably owned the fee of the land to the center of the street <em>(Allen </em>v. <em>Mussen, </em>129 Conn. 151, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>155, 26 Atl. [2d] 776) Flodin was on its premises when he was hurt and that the defendant was therefore liable under the statute. They also claim that the use of this sidewalk by the employees with the knowledge of the defendant involved a risk peculiar to the employment and became a condition of it under the doctrine of such cases as <em>Corvi </em>v. <em>Stiles &amp; Reynolds Brick Co., </em>103 Conn. 449, 452, 130 Atl. 674.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-6\">General Statutes, \u00a7 5226, provides for payment of compensation to an employee for personal injuries \u201carising out of and in the course of his employment.\u201d Section 5223 defines these terms as follows: \u201cThe words \u2018arising out of and in the course of his employment,\u2019 as used in this chapter, shall mean an accidental injury happening to an employee . . . originating while he shall have been engaged in the line of his duty in the business or affairs of the employer upon the employer\u2019s premises, or while so engaged elsewhere upon the employer\u2019s business or affairs by the direction, express or implied, of the employer.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b260-8\">The word \u201cpremises\u201d has not been defined in Connecticut in connection with this particular statute. <em>Bates </em>v. <em>Connecticut Power Co., </em>130 Conn. 256, 259, 33 Atl. (2d) 342, is concerned with \u00a7 5230. A definition quoted therein, at page 261, is not, however, without significance here: \u201cSpeaking of \u2018premises,\u2019 <em>Buckley, L. J., </em>in <em>Andrews </em>v. <em>Andrews &amp; Mears, </em>[1908] 2 K. B. 567, 570, says: \u2018That word implies some definite place with metes and bounds, say land, or land with buildings upon it. A public street is not, in my opinion, within these words at all.\u2019 \u201d The man in the street would be surprised to find that in walking along a public sidewalk passing the houses of A, B, C and D he was successively on the premises of A, B, C and D. The extent of the rights of the public and, by inference, the very limited rights of the abutting owner <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>are discussed in <em>Arborio </em>v. <em>Hartford Electric Light Co., </em>130 Conn. 592, 596, 36 Atl. (2d) 384.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-4\">The word \u201cpremises\u201d is less inclusive than \u201cproperty\u201d and ordinarily does not include the sidewalk in front of the place of employment. 1 Campbell, Workmen\u2019s Compensation, \u00a7 167; <em>Wiles </em>v. <em>American Oil Co., </em>105 Pa. Super. 282, 285, 161 Atl. 467; <em>Krebs </em>v. <em>Industrial Commission, </em>200 Wis. 134, 227 N. W. 287. \u201cTo be considered as happening on the \u2018premises\u2019 of the employer the accident must have occurred on property owned, leased or controlled by the employer and so connected with the business in which the employee is engaged, as to form a component or integral part of it.\u201d <em>Feeney </em>v. <em>N. Snellenburg &amp; Co., </em>103 Pa. Super. 284, 287, 157 Atl. 379. While here the defendant presumably was the owner of the sidewalk in a very limited sense, it was an integral part of the highway rather than of the defendant\u2019s property. Premises \u201chas reference to lands or buildings regarded as separate units or entities, with differing characteristics, presumably occupied separately and bounded or limited in some manner. . . . \u2018The premises\u2019 is not an apt expression to designate areas devoted to public ways all of which together form one continuous system.\u201d <em>Doherty\u2019s Case, </em>294 Mass. 363, 366, 2 N. E. (2d) 186; see also 1 Schneider, Workmen\u2019s Compensation Law (2d Ed.), \u00a7 266.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-5\">This discussion makes any extended consideration of the plaintiff\u2019s claim that the use of the sidewalk was a condition of the employment unnecessary. The Connecticut cases are reviewed in <em>Lake </em>v. <em>Bridgeport, </em>supra, and <em>Taylor </em>v. <em>M. A. Gammino Construction Co., 127 </em>Conn. 528, 18 Atl. (2d) 400. In the necessary use of the sidewalk in front of the defendant\u2019s factory to reach his place of employment, Flodin was exercising a right which was his own, a right which differed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>neither in kind nor degree from .that enjoyed by any other member of the general public. It cannot be assumed that he was relying on any implied direction of consent of the defendant. The risk was not peculiar to the employment nor was it annexed thereto. The fact that the employer \u201ccontemplated\u201d that Flodiii would \u00fase the sidewalk is not sufficient to take it out of the general rule. <em>Drouin </em>v. <em>Chelsea Silk Co., </em>122 Conn. 129, 134, 187 Atl. 904; <em>Bryan </em>v. <em>T. A. Loving Co., 222 </em>N. C. 724, 729, 24 S. E. (2d) 751. The conclusion of the commissioner was warranted by the facts found.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-6\">For the reasons stated we disagree with the conclusions reached in <em>Barnett </em>v. <em>Britling Cafeteria Co., </em>225 Ala. 462, 143 So. 813, and <em>LeBlanc </em>v. <em>Ohio Oil Co., </em>7 La. App. 721, relied on by the plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"AbD\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"AzT\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
