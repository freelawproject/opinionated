Though the publication may be to the disadvantage of the particular suitor, the paramount advantage to the public fully justifies the end attained. Perhaps the earliest and best expression of the reason of the rule is that contained in the opinion of Lawrence, J., in <em>Rex </em>v. <em>Wright, </em>8 Term R., 298, in which it is stated, in substance, that though the publication of proceedings in courts \u2022of justice may severely reflect on individuals, yet such publications, if they contain true accounts, are not libels, nor the subjects of actions, because it is of great importance that the proceedings of courts of justice shall be known; that the general advantage to the country in having these proceedings made public more than counterbalances the inconvenience to the person whose conduct may be the subject of the proceedings; or, as Pollock, C. B., said in <em>Ryalls </em>v. <em>Leader, </em>L. R., 1 Exch., 299: \u201c We ought to make as wide as possible the right of the public to know what takes place in any court of justice, and to protect a fair <em>Iona fide </em>statement of proceedings there.\u201d There was a judicial hearing and inquiry had in the present case in open court, and the public had the right to know all about it. The policy of the state is tersely expressed in these words: \u201cEvery citizen may freely speak, write and publish his sentiments on all subjects, being responsible for the abuse of that right; and no law shall be passed to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"860\">*860</page-number>restrain or abridge the liberty of speech or of the press.\u201d Const., art. 1, \u00a7 8. This is the supreme law of the land, and. contains as noble a sentiment as was ever penned by man. The truth, irrespective of motives, is a complete justification to a civil action for libel. In criminal prosecutions the accused is obliged to go a step further, and prove that the publication was made with good motives, and for justifiable ends. Id. This is to prevent breaches of the public peace. ISTor is a defendant, by pleading the truth in justification, although the plea be unsustained by proof at the trial, entitled to have that circumstance considered by the jury as evidence of malice, or to enhance the damages, <em>Klinch </em>v. Colby, 46 N. Y., 427, unless it be interposed in bad faith, <em>Holmes </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>121 N. Y., 461; 31 St. Rep., 379, and the circumstances warrant that conclusion. Every one has a right to comment on matters of public interest and general concern, provided he does so fairly, and with an honest purpose. Such comments are not libelous, however severe in their terms, unless they are written maliciously. While the law justifies honest reports and comments, it will not permit one, under the guise of reporting proceedings, tcv use the dagger of malice, the assassin of character, to circulate falsehood, whose only office is to injure and destroy. Eeport and comment are two separate and distinct things. A report is the mechanical reproduction of what actually took place. Comment is the judgment passed on the circumstances reported by one who. has applied his mind to them. Fair reports are privileged, while fair comments are no libels at all. Blending the reports and comment together does not make the article libelous if it would not, be such if the one were separated from the other. A careful reading of the article complained of, in connection with the pleadings in the action commented upon, in the light of the evidence given by the plaintiff on this trial, proves that the article is a fair report, and that the comments are substantially true. The report is, therefore, within the protection of privileged publications, and the comments are fully justified by the facts disclosed. The comments, being true, are not libelous, and the report being privileged, the plaintiff could only recover upon affirmative proof of malice, and there is an entire absence of that essential element in this case. Where the publication is not privileged, a different, rule prevails, and malice may be implied from the mere falsity of the charge, but where the communication is privileged it rebuts the <em>prima facie </em>inference of malice, and throws upon the plaintiff the burden of proving malice in fact. Eeference to the language of the article, and to the facts in the pleading and evidence confirming its accuracy, has been intentionally omitted, as it might, prove as offensive to the plaintiff as the article itself; perhaps more so. There has been a tendency in some cases to limit the power of the court to the decision of the question whether the article complained of is privileged, and requiring the submission to the jury of the question whether the defendant fairly and properly conducted himself in the exercise of it; but the evidence in this case so clearly shows the absence of misconduct that the action admits of only one result, and that a verdict for the defend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"861\">*861</page-number>ant. The English cases hold that it is only when the judge is satisfied that the publication cannot be a libel, and that, if it is found by the jury to be such, their verdict will be set aside, that he is justified in withdrawing the question from their cognizance. Per Kelly, C. B., <em>Cox </em>v. <em>Lee. </em>L. R., 4 Exch., 288; <em>Hart </em>v. <em>Wall, 2 </em>C. P. Div., 146. The article here complained of is not susceptible of a double meaning, one innocent, and the other libelous; and the action does not fall within the rule requiring the jury to determine whether the article is libelous or not. The rule applicable is that where, upon the whole evidence, a verdict in favor of a plaintiff would be set aside as against evidence, it is the duty of the court to grant a nonsujt. <em>Neuendorff </em>v. <em>World M. L. I. Co., </em>69 N. Y., 393. This is such a case. No injustice was done to the plaintiff; his complaint was properly dismissed, and the motion for a new trial must be denied.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b913-4\">Smith, <em>Bowman &amp; </em>Close, for app\u2019lt; <em>Lowrey, Stone &amp; Auerbach, </em>for resp\u2019t.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b913-5\">Per Curiam.</author>\n<p id=\"ApX-\">Judgment and order affirmed upon the opinion of the learned trial judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-6\">Sedgwick, Ch.
