He had no warning. The court sent the question of negligence to the jury, and they awarded his widow and administratrix $5,000 damages. The defendant insists it was error not to non-suit the plaintiff, and cites <em>Besel </em>v. <em>N. Y. C. &amp; H. R. R. R. Co., </em>70 N. Y., 171, to sustain its claim. Whether the defendant performed its duty to its-employee was, on the evidence and the inferences to be drawn from it, a question for the jury. <em>Abel v. D. &amp; H. C. Co., </em>103 N. Y., 581; 4 St. Rep., 269; S. C., 128 N. Y., 662; 40 St. Rep., 626. The jury were properly instructed as to the law, and their verdict on the facts is sufficiently supported by the proofs. True, it was incumbent on the plaintiff to show affirmatively that the negligence of the defendant was the sole cause of death. But it was unnecessary to to do this by positive and direct evidence of negligence of the defendant, and of freedom from negligence of the deceased. The proofs may be indirect, and the evidence had by showing circumstances from which the inference is fairly and logically to be drawn that these essential facts existed. When, from the circumstances shown, inferences are to be drawn which are 'not certain and incontrovertible, and may be differently made by different minds, the question is one for the jury. See note to 39 Am. at p. 513; <em>Hays </em>v. <em>Miller, </em>70 N. Y., 112; <em>Powell </em>v. <em>Powell, </em>71 id., 71; <em>Hart </em>v. <em>H. R. B. Co., </em>80 id., 622; <em>Ochsenbein </em>v. <em>Shapley, </em>85 id., 224. The inferences to be drawn from the evidence were sufficient to warrant the jury in finding that, the defendant had not given reasonable protection to its employee while in the performance of his work, and that its breach of duty and negligence resulted in his \u25a0death. The motion for a new trial must be denied. Forty days stay of execution after notice of entry of judgment, and a like time to make a case.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b948-2\"><em>Abram Kling, </em>for resp\u2019t; <em>Frank Loomis, </em>for app\u2019lt.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b948-3\">Per Curiam.</author>\n<p id=\"ASX\">For the reasons set forth in the opinion of the court below, the judgment and order appealed from are affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b948-4\">Freedman, Dugro and G-ildersleeve, JJ., concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
