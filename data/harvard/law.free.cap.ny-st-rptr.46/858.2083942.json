It is to recover $19,546.09, and but for the voluntary assignment made by Linde &amp; Co., the cross demand could have been litigated in the supreme court action. If that action is stayed, the defendant here, who is the plaintiff there, can use only a small portion of his demand ($4,811.46), and may have to renew his litigation as <em>to </em>the balance. If the supreme court action is tried first, the entire $19,546.09 will be litigated and disposed of. The law does not encourage double trials and multiplicity of suits, and the court. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"859\">*859</page-number>will stay one action and allow the other, in which the entire relief maybe awarded, to proceed. 53 Barb., 98; 4 Cow., 78; 5 id., 282; 2 Sand., 699; 30 St. Rep., 239; S.

It follows that the defendant\u2019s motion for a stay must be granted, and the plaintiff\u2019s motion to compel an election denied.
