It is only where there has plainly been an arbitrary abuse of that discretion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>that the court will interfere. But whether the court will interfere or not is plainly a matter for its judgment upon the petition, writ, return thereto, and the .evidence and papers which were before the commissioners. Upon looking over the whole ground, the court will, in a summary way, decide whether the commissioners have abused their power and arbitrarily rejected the applicant\u2019s petition. It is the court which must decide this, not a jury. The framing of an issue was never contemplated by the act of 1886 ; and if that practice were permitted, juries would soon be turned into excise commissioners. We require no opinion from a jury as to whether the commissioners acted arbitrarily in the matter, but the court will itself decide that question. The order to frame issues should therefore be vacated.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b94-3\"><em>Albert I.
