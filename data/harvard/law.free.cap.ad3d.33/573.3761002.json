However, a property owner may not be held liable for trivial defects, not constituting a trap or a nuisance, over which a person might merely stumble, stub his or her toes, or trip <em>(see Taussig v Luxury Cars of Smithtown, Inc., supra; Hagood v City of New York, supra). </em>In determining whether a defect is trivial, the court must examine all of the facts presented, including the \u201cwidth, depth, elevation, irregularity and appearance of the defect along with the \u2018time, place, and circumstance\u2019 of the injury\u201d <em>(Trincere v County of Suffolk, supra </em>at 978, quoting <em>Caldwell v Village of Is. Park, </em>304 NY 268, 274 [1952]).</p>\n<p id=\"b584-5\">In support of its cross motion for summary judgment, the defendant submitted evidence including photographs of the slightly raised area of concrete which allegedly caused the plaintiff\u2019s accident, and the plaintiff\u2019s deposition testimony describing the defect. Considering the appearance of the defect, which did not have any of the characteristics of a trap or snare, and the other relevant circumstances of the accident, the defendant\u2019s submissions were sufficient to make a prima facie showing that the alleged defect was too trivial to be actionable <em>(see Taussig v Luxury Cars of Smithtown, Inc., supra; Bekritsky v TACS-4, Inc., </em>27 AD3d 680 [2006]; <em>Trampakoulous v Independent Coach Bus Co., </em>18 AD3d 739 [2005]; <em>Chillemi v National Birchwood Corp., </em>16 AD3d 612 [2005]; <em>Murray v City of New York, </em>15 AD3d 636 [2005]; <em>Torres v City of New York, </em>300 AD2d 391 [2002]). In opposition, the plaintiff failed to raise a triable issue of fact <em>(see Taussig v Luxury Cars of Smithtown, Inc., supra; Bekritsky v TACS-4, Inc., supra). </em>Accordingly, the Supreme Court should have granted the defendant\u2019s cross motion for summary judgment dismissing the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-6\">The parties\u2019 remaining contentions have either been rendered academic or need not be reached in light of our determination.
