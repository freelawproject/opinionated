Braun, J.), entered April 20, 2005, which, in an action involving defendant City\u2019s obligation to provide discharge planning for plaintiffs, a class consisting of inmates receiving treatment for mental illness while incarcerated in a \u201cCity Jail\u201d <em>(see </em>185 Misc 2d 420 [2000], <em>affd for reasons stated </em>276 AD2d 440 [2000]), declared that inmates housed in forensic units located at Bellevue, Kings County and Elmhurst hospitals are class members subject to the parties\u2019 stipulation of settlement (the settlement), unanimously affirmed, without costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-8\">The IAS court correctly held that the term \u201cCity Jail\u201d in the settlement is not ambiguous, and correctly interpreted it, as a matter of law without reference to extrinsic evidence <em>(see Kass v Kass, </em>91 NY2d 554, 566-567 [1998]), to include \u201cforensic units\u201d (referred to as \u201csecure hospital units\u201d by defendants and \u201cprison wards\u201d by plaintiffs) housing mentally ill inmates. The settlement defines \u201cCity Jail\u201d as \u201ca correctional facility operated by one or more defendants.\u201d It is undisputed that the New York City Health and Hospitals Corporation (HHC), a defendant herein, operates these units. In addition, under New York City Charter \u00a7 623 (1), the Correction Commissioner has \u201c[c]harge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>and management of all institutions of the city, including all hospital wards therein for the care and custody of. . . prisoners . . . who require hospital care, including those requiring psychiatric observation or treatment . . . , except such places for the detention of prisoners ... as are by law placed under the charge of some other agency.\u201d In view of the foregoing, no ambiguity as to the meaning of the term \u201cCity Jail\u201d is raised by its somewhat narrower definition in the class certification order as \u201ca correctional facility operated by Department of Correction,\u201d and the lack of a definition for the term \u201ccorrectional facility.\u201d Clearly, each forensic unit is a \u201cfacility\u201d and, because they are facilities where inmates with mental illness are housed and detained under the custody and supervision of the Department of Correction, each is a \u201ccorrectional facility\u201d and therefore a \u201cCity Jail\u201d within the contemplation of the settlement.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-4\">To be sure, both before the IAS court and on appeal, defendants make forceful arguments based on the conduct of the parties prior to the instant dispute that the term \u201cCity Jail\u201d was not intended to include the forensic units. Defendants assert, for example, and plaintiffs apparently do not contend otherwise, both (1) that during extensive discovery proceedings plaintiffs never sought any discovery relating to the forensic units, and (2) that during extensive settlement discussions conducted over the course of more than a year, the parties never discussed inmates housed in the forensic units or any procedures associated with the units. However, \u201c[t]he best evidence of what parties to a written agreement intend is what they say in their writing\u201d <em>(Slamow v Del Col, </em>79 NY2d 1016, 1018 [1992]). Because the relevant terms of the settlement\u2014\u201cCity Jail\u201d and \u201ccorrectional facility\u201d\u2014are clear and unambiguous, the extrinsic evidence bearing on the conduct of the parties may not be considered <em>(see South Rd. Assoc., LLC v International Bus. Machs. Corp., </em>4 NY3d 272, 278 [2005]). Defendants\u2019 reliance on the absence of any specific mention in the settlement of the forensic units is similarly unavailing <em>(see Nissho Iwai Europe v Korea First Bank, </em>99 NY2d 115, 121-122 [2002] [\u201cambiguity does not arise from silence, but from what was written so blindly and imperfectly that its meaning is doubtful\u201d (internal quotation marks and citation omitted)]). Finally, the agreement\u2019s definition of the term \u201cMental Health Centers\u201d does not demonstrate or suggest that the forensic units are not encompassed by the term \u201cCity Jails.\u201d Ultimately, defendants\u2019 contention otherwise rests on extrinsic evidence that the forensic units provide a higher level of care than is provided in the mental health centers.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-5\">We have considered defendants\u2019 other arguments and find <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>them to be unavailing.
