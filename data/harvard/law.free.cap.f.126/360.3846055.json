The question is equivalent to one asking whether the applicant ever had the habit of drinking to excess, and a negative answer does not constitute a misrepresentation or false statement, which will avoid a policy issued thereon, merely because it is shown that the insured had sometimes, but not habitually, drank to excess.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"syllabus\" id=\"b394-14\">If 1.

In his charge to the jury, Judge Speer said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-6\">\u201cThese grounds of defense are, first, that the policy was obtained by false and fraudulent stipulations and misrepresentations made to the assurance company by Bivins, as follows: That in the application made to the defendant by Bivins, dated April 3, 1894, in reply to the question therein, \u2018Have you ever used spirits, wine, or malt liquors?\u2019 he said and answered, \u2018Moderately.\u2019 In reply to the question whether he had ever used spirits, wine, or malt liquors to excess, he said and replied positively and without qualification that he never had. Relying upon the faith of this, it is alleged that the company issued the policy, and it now says that these statements were not true, but were made with the purpose and intent on the part of said Bivins to conceal the truth, and fraudulently to mislead and deceive it, and induce it to accept \u00e1 risk which the defendant in no wise would have done, the answer states, \u2018had the truth in respect to his use of wines, spirits, or malt liquors been made known by Bivins to the defendant. * * *\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-7\">\u201cNow, let us give more careful attention to the language of these questions. \u2018Have you ever used spirits,\u2019 etc., \u2018to excess?\u2019 What is the meaning of the word \u2018used\u2019 in this connection? That, in my judgment, is the crucial question in the construction of this application. The word \u2018used\u2019 adopted for the purpose of this question does not imply an occasional, indulgence in strong drink. It means to be accustomed, to make a practice of. When you speak of a man as using diligence in business, you mean that he is habitually industrious and attentive to business. In his essay on Ranke\u2019s History of the Popes, that master of our language, Macaulay, says: \u2018The Catholic Church neither submits to enthusiasm nor prescribes it. but uses it.\u2019 It is a word which is synonymous with \u2014 that is, meaning the same with \u2014 \u2018custom\u2019 or \u2018habit,\u2019 or, in this case, \u2018habitual indulgence.\u2019 Habit in this connection imports a disposition or condition of the body or mind acquired by custom, or a frequent repetition of the same act; or, to express it otherwise, the customary conduct to pursue which one has acquired a tendency from the frequent repetition of the same act. When a man states he uses tobacco, he means that he smokes and chews it as a habit. If the assurance company had desired to know whether the insured was a total abstainer, it doubtless would have chosen language in the preparation of its questions which must have evoked the fact; such, for instance, as, \u2018Are you a total abstainer?\u2019 \u2018Do you drink?\u2019 \u2018Do you drink to excess?\u2019 or, \u2018Have you ever been drunk?\u2019 Now, it is perhaps true that few insurance companies could profitably conduct their business if they restricted their policies to those who never indulged in strong drink, namely, total abstainers. It is essential to the earning capacity of the company that it should induce persons to insure, and it is also essential to the same thing that it should only take safe risks. With this view, as I construe the language of those questions, the defendant has sought to guard against men who habitually use ardent drink, and especially against those who ever habitually drink to excess. Hence the utilization of the words, \u2018Have you ever used,\u2019 etc., which do not fairly mean, in this connection, have you ever partaken, but have you been in the habit of drinking, or have you ever been in the habit of drinking to excess. This I take to be a just and practical construction of this language, which it is the duty of the court to make, and of the jury to accept. It was not denied by the insured that he used \u2014 that is, that he was accustomed to partake of \u2014liquors. He said, however, that he did this \u2018moderately.\u2019 Since the company issued the policy in view of that statement, it would be hound by it, so far as that is in issue, unless it is proved to be false. He did, however, deny that he ever used spirits, etc., to excess. It will be observed that I un<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>derstand the words, \u2018Have you ever used spirits * * * to excess?\u2019 to mean, have you ever had the habit of drinking to excess. The Supreme Court of the United States in the case of Insurance Company v. Foley [105 U. S. 350, 26 L. Ed. 1055] passed upon practically the same question, and that decision is not only advisory to the court and illuminating, hut it is controlling. There the inquiry was, \u2018Is the party of temperate habits?\u2019 \u2018Has he always been so?\u2019 The answers were, \u2018Yes.\u2019 The insurance companies contended that that was not true. One witness testified that in 1871 and in 1872 he was the family physician of the insured; that at that time the insured was drinking hard; that during the year he attended him for delirium tremens, and once or twice for indisposition produced, as he thought, from the excessive use of intoxicating drink; and that he regarded him as a man of intemperate habits. On' cross-examination he admitted that he did not know the insured intimately, had no relations with him other than professional, and saw him only when he attended him professionally or met him occasionally on the street. Other witnesses testified that he was a very intemperate man, and that they bad frequently seen him under the influence of liquor. But in that case for the plaintiff several witnesses were called who had known the insured intimately for many years. One of them had been his partner in 1869 and 1870, and they all testified unqualifiedly to his being a man of temperate habits. The court in passing on these facts said: \u2018The question was as to the habits of the insured. His occasional use of intoxicating liquors did not render him a man of intemperate habits, nor would an exceptional case of excess justify the application of this character to him.\u2019 And then the learned justice states the somewhat startling proposition: \u2018An attack of delirium tremens may sometimes follow a single excessive indulgence. When we speak of the habits of a person we refer to his customary conduct, to pursue which he has acquired a tendency from frequent repetition of the same acts. It would be incorrect to say that a man has a habit of anything from a single act. A habit of early rising, for example, could not be affirmed of one because he was once seen on the streets in the morning before the sun had risen. Nor could intemperate habits be imputed to him because his appearance and actions on that occasion might indicate a night of excessive indulgence. The court did not, therefore, err in instructing the jury that if the habits of the insured, in the usual, ordinary, and every day routine of his life, were temperate, the representations made were not untrue within the meaning of the policy, although he may have had an attack of delirium tremens from an exceptional overindulgence. It could not be contemplated from the language used in the policy that it should become void for an occasional excess of the insured, but only when such excesses had by frequent repetitions become a habit.\u2019 This is but another form, I think, of expressing the same deduction I have made for your assistance from the words, \u2018Have you ever used spirits * * * to excess ?\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b396-4\">The judgment of the Circuit Court is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
