Aldrich, receiver of the Michigan Savings &amp; Loan Association of Detroit, Mich., to take charge of its assets in Texas. He was empowered and directed to collect all debts due to the association. Under this order he filed in the Circuit Court a bill against F. B. Manor, seeking to collect a debt from Manor, and to enforce a vendor\u2019s lien upon real estate. The Circuit Court decided that there was due the association $583.25, with interest, and rendered a decree against Manor for that sum, \u201cin so far only as the same can be made out of the proceeds of the sale of said premises and said stock as hereinafter directed.\u201d Manor took an appeal to this court, and, with proper specifications, assigned that the court erred in rendering this decree. ,</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b968-12\">To show the questions involved, it is necessary to make a full statement of the case. On June 1, 1893, A. W. Weatherred subscribed for four shares of the capital stock of the Michigan Savings &amp; Loan Association, of the nominal value of $100 a share, to be paid for in installments of $1 a share per month.

Yinson, executed and delivered to the association the following bond:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b969-8\">\u201cKnow all men by these presents, that A. W.

On December 21, 1893, Manor, the appellant, bought the lot of Weatherred for $1,050. He paid $650 in cash, and assumed a liability, as shown by the deed made to him, which deed is as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b969-14\">\u201cState of Texas, County of Hill.

B. Wemple, a witness for the complainant, who was secretary of the association, exhibited with his deposition the certificate for the four shares of stock issued to Weatherred, June 1, 1893, on which was a written assignment by him to F. B. Manor, but the assignment was without date. Wemple testified that the assignment was \u201capproved on the 2d day of June, 1894.\u201d There is no evidence in the record that the certificate ever came into the possession of Manor, the appellant. Manor testified that the certificate \u201cwas not assigned to me, and I most certainly did not assume to carry out any stock contract at the time * * * mentioned.\u201d Manor, in his pleadings and evidence, claims that he paid to the association during the years 1894 to 1898, inclusive, $546, which sum he claims as a credit on the purchase money of the land; that is, he claims that the payments should have been applied in satisfaction of the note which he had assumed, as shown by the terms of the deed to him. Wemple, witness for the complainant, testifies that the payments made by Manor were applied in part to interest on the loan, and in part to payment of the premiums on the same. In brief, according to Wemple\u2019s evidence, the association treated Manor as a stockholder, and as the owner of the four shares in question, and the money he paid was applied for the purpose of maturing the stock issued to Weatherred.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b970-8\">The decree of the circuit court sustains this application of the payments. The contention of the appellant, in his answer and cross-bill filed in the court below and in the first assignment of error made here, is that all payments made by him, and which he claims amounted to $546, should have been applied to the payment of the $400 note and interest, the payment of which he had assumed as part of the purchase money of the lot conveyed to him, and that no part of the payments should have been applied on the stock contract.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b970-9\">R.

The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"937\">*937</page-number>only writing in the record to which Manor is a party, and of which he is shown to have knowledge, that shows he assumed any liability, is the deed made by Weatherred and wife to Manor. It is recited in that instrument that its consideration is $1,050, of which $650 was paid in cash, and the remainder was to be paid by the assumption and payment by Manor of \u201cone promissory note for the sum of $400, said note being executed by the said Weatherred, and payable to the order of T. E. Duncan, and dated June 27, 1893, and indorsed by the said Duncan to the Michigan Loan &amp; Savings Company, of Detroit, Mich.\u201d The $400 note, added to the cash paid, makes the entire consideration of the conveyance. There is no language in the deed requiring Manor to assume the payment of any premiums.</p>\n<p id=\"b971-4\">The appellee contends that Manor is bound by the obligations of the bond executed by Weatherred with Vinson as surety. We find no language in the deed accepted by Manor that produces such result. That bond is for the sum of $400 only. It is true that in the condition of the bond the obligation of Weatherred, as a holder of four shares of stock, is recited, and also his obligation to make payments of interest and of premiums, as well as his liability for fines, charges, and penalties, and Weatherred, as a stockholder, may have been liable by the terms of the bond for these several sums in addition to the $400. The penalty of the bond, however, is only $400. But Manor is not a party to the bond. The bond, in its condition, contains a stipulation that Weatherred, the stockholder, should \u201cfully comply with all the other provisions of said by-laws of said association.\u201d It cannot be said that Manor assumed <em>any </em>such obligation, unless it be found that he became a stockholder of the association. The only reference in the bond to the note which was assumed by Manor is that on the maturity of the shares of stock they were to be transferred to the association in satisfaction of \u201cone vendor\u2019s lien note,\u201d describing the $400 note. We look in vain in the record for satisfactory evidence that Manor assumed the obligations of this bond. He clearly assumed the payment of the $400 note. The fact that such note is described in the bond surely cannot make him liable for the premiums, fines, charges, and penalties which may under the by-laws of the association be imposed on a member.</p>\n<p id=\"b971-5\">The receiver seeks to fasten an obligation on Manor as a shareholder in the association. Manor denies that he is a shareholder. \u2022 The burden of proof, therefore, is on the receiver. It is not shown that Manor ever made an \u201capplication for membership\u201d under section 16 of the by-laws, or ever subscribed for stock, or ever participated in the election of the officers of the association, or attended a meeting of the stockholders, or that he signed any writing indicating his membership in the association. He never received or asked for any of the benefits of membership. It is true that he knew that the association held the $400 note, and that he was to be permitted to pay it in small installments, but on one occasion he paid as much as $184.80 in one payment. The former secretary of the association produces the certificate of stock issued to Weatherred with a transfer thereon to Manor without date. It is not shown that Manor ever had the certificate in his possession. The transfer, however, is made on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"938\">*938</page-number>books of the association, but it is not shown that Manor had knowledge of this fact. The transfer of stock is often the evidence of a contract of much importance. If one buys stock and secures its transfer to him on the books of the corporation, he steps into the shoes of the transferror, and is liable usually for unpaid subscriptions, and besides assumes all of the responsibility of a shareholder. But if the transfer is made to him without his knowledge or consent, and without his having purchased the stock or assumed the position of a stockholder, the'transfer imposes on him no liability. It would be intolerable to permit one who had subscribed for and received stock to avoid the liability and burdens of his position by loading them on another without the other\u2019s knowledge or consent. The approval of such transfer by the corporation would not bind the transferee. If the transferee did not authorize, contract for, or accept the transfer, clearly he cannot be liable as a shareholder, unless he subsequently in some way assumed to act as such. Under such circumstances a court of equity should relieve the transferee of all obligations as a shareholder. Gray\u2019s Case, i Ch. Div. L,. R. 664.</p>\n<p id=\"b972-4\">If a transfer of stock always carried a benefit, a different rule might prevail, for it might be presumed that the transferee acquiesced in that which was to his interest. But the ownership of stock in a building and loan association by a debtor to the association is often burdensome. Where the ownership, as in this case, imposes a burden, and enables the association to apply payments made on a land purchase to a worthless stock contract, justice requires that the burden should not be imposed without clear proof that the defendant agreed to become a stockholder.</p>\n<p id=\"b972-5\">The evidence,, we think, considered as a whole, shows that Manor only assumed to pay the $400 note, and that it was understood that he was to pay it in installments as drafts were drawn by the association. It is not shown, we think, that he made any contract to make payments on shares in the association or to pay premiums. The payments, therefore, that he has made should be applied to the satisfaction of the note for $400. If after making such application some part of the note remains unpaid, the receiver would be entitled to a decree against Manor for such sum, together with a vendor\u2019s lien upon the lot, and if such sum is not paid the lot should be sold under decree to satisfy it. If the amount of the payments is not clearly shown, and is not agreed on by the parties, the court should decree a reference to a master.</p>\n<p id=\"b972-6\">We think the court erred in permitting the application of parts of the payments made by Manor to the stock contract with Weatherred.</p>\n<p id=\"b972-7\">The decree of the Circuit Court is reversed, and the cause remanded, with instructions to proceed in conformity with the opinion of this court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
