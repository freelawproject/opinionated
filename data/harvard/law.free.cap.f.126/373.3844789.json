These former hoods were clumsy, and had not been well adapted to practicable and successful \u2018scopes.\u2019 The invention made darker chambers within the hoods more feasible, and came immediately into extensive use, and the patent for it seems to be valid for what it covers. The more important and difficult question is as to infringement. In the defendant\u2019s \u2018scopes\u2019 complained of, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>shaft stops at the lens-holder, as before, and a piece of veneering shaped to fit the nose and face and curved to lie at each end within and upon the lower edges of the hood is fastened to the shaft there. The patent cannot be valid for excluding the light from below and forming a darker chamber within the hood, for that would be old, but only for the means by which the darker chamber is formed and maintained. The defendant does not extend the shaft bodily beyond the lens-holder, for excluding light from below and supporting the edges of the hood, but adds another piece extending from the end of the shaft and supported by the edges of the hood excluding the light. This piece does not support the edges of the hood, which is one object of the patented invention, but does exclude the light from below, which is another object, by what, for this purpose, is an extension of the shaft, in the same way. Splicing out the shaft to exclude the light is the substantial equivalent of extending the shaft bodily for the same purpose, and this part of the invention appears to have been appropriated by the defendant.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b408-4\">Even if the correctness of the conclusion of the court below as to the validity of the patent be assumed, we are unable to accept its final conclusion upon the question of. infringement. The patentee, in his specification, describes his construction as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b408-5\">\u201cThe invention relates to the construction of the several parts of the common hand stereoscope, and constitutes an improvement in the method of mak-. ing and putting together the several parts, whereby a more convenient and durable \u2018scope\u2019 is produced. As \u2018scopes\u2019 have heretofore been constructed, the front end of the shaft has been cut off flush with the front side of the lens-frame, and the hood has been carried around only to the edge of the broad part of the shaft, so that there was a considerable opening on each side of the nose of the observer for the admission of light to the eyes from below, which would interfere with perfect vision. I have devised several varieties of hood to obviate this interference of light from below, of which this is one. The edge of the hood and of the end of the shaft are shaped to conform to the contour of the face, so that when the instrument is held to the face all parts of the edge of the hood and end of the shaft will fit the face. By carrying the shaft across the lens-frame, as shown, and holding the ends of the hood in rabbets or grooves, a much firmer structure is obtained, and the hood is held from curling or warping out of shape \u2014 a thing it is liable to do, as it is generally made up of veneers transversely laid up in glue.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b408-6\">This construction of a shaft supporting a hood is made the essential element of the three claims, and in the first and second claims is specified as so arranged that the shaft is practically a part of the hood. The defendant\u2019s stereoscope is manufactured under patent No. 599,878, granted to H. S. Walbridge May 12, 1896. As found by the court below, defendant does not extend his shaft, but, in order to shut out the light, adds a separate bridge piece, not supporting, but within and supported by, the hood. This bridge piece is composed of very thin and flexible wooden veneers, is stamped out by dies, and is tacked to the' shaft. Manifestly, its use does not produce \u201ca much firmer structure,\u201d nor is the hood \u201cheld from curling oro warping out of shape.\u201d In view of the narrow scope which must be \u00b0 given to the claims in order to sustain the validity of the patent in suit, it must be held that they are not infringed by defendant\u2019s construction.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-7\">The decree is reversed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
