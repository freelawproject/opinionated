Kerr recovered a judgment against the city of New Orleans in the Circuit Court for $2,503. An execution issued thereon by authority of which the marshal seized a certain square of ground situated in the city of New Orleans, with all the buildings and improvements thereon, and all rights, ways, privileges, and servitudes thereunto belonging. The city by supplemental bill applied for a restraining order and injunction against the seizure and sale of the property. The fourth paragraph of the bill is as follows: \u201cAnd your orator further complains and says that the said Kerr, for the use and benefit of Bernard Berkson, is without right or power to seize and sell the aforedescribed real estate under the writ of pluries fieri facias obtained by him, for the reason that said property was and is dedicated to public use and held by your orator in trust for the use and benefit of all the inhabitants of the city of New Orleans, as part of the public quay in use as a sugar shed. That, as declared by the Supreme Court of the United States as to this property in the case of New Orleans v. Louisiana Construction Company, 140 U. 5. 681 [11 Sup. Ct. 971, 35 L. Ed. 556]: \u2018It is undisputed and indisputable that the spaces of land in question were originally part of the public quay or levee in New Orleans dedicated to public use, and in the phrase of the law of Louisiana locus publicus, and that they never ceased to be such.\u2019 That as aforesaid the property seized was set apart by the city of New Orleans to provide for the shelter and protection of sugar and molasses received at the port of New Orleans. That the said property seized is a portion of the public quay or levee, and that part on which the said sugar shed stands is between the front row of houses and the Mississippi river, and is part of the ground dedicated as locus publicus in the plans of the city made before the session of Louisiana to the United States. That for many generations it has been in actual and exclusive public use as a levee or landing place for the sugar and molasses brought to the city in steamboats and other vessels, and has been covered to afford protection for the said sugar and molasses when landed in the regular course of commerce and navigation. That, as found by the honorable Supreme Court of the United States in the case referred to, the sheltering of the sugar and molasses from the weather by the city of New Orleans, either directly or through the instrumentality of an agent appointed for that purpose, was not a new and distinct use, nor in any sense a private one, but was incidental to the principal public use of landing the aforesaid articles of commerce, and that the sheds for sheltering the goods were as subservient to the public use of the quay as the wharves for landing them. That the title to the said property always has been and still remains in the public. That the public never has been divested thereof. That the use of the levee for the equally important use of a highway has always been carefully guarded, and its destination or character as locus publicus has never been changed.\u201d Upon the application of the city a restraining order was granted by Pardee, Circuit Judge, to remain in force until the decision upon the motion for an injunction. Rev. St U. S. 718 [U. S. Comp. St. 1901, p. 580].</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b956-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"922\">*922</page-number>To \u201cthe rule to show cause why the injunction prayed for should not issue\u201d defendants filed a \u201creturn,\u201d with accompanying exhibits. The \u201creturn,\u201d omitting reference to the exhibits, was as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b956-4\">\u201cThat the property so seized is the property of the city of New Orleans, in commerce, and subject to seizure for the payment of the judgment rendered in favor of respondents. That heretofore the said property so seized was held under lease by the New Orleans Sugar Sheds Company, from which the city of New Orleans derived a revenue for the use and occupancy of same. That on May 19, 1902, by ordinance No. 1,243, New Council Series (Calendar No. 1,680), the city of New Orleans, acting through its proper authorities, directed the comptroller to advertise for sale the property seized herein, the sale of the property so advertised to be on terms of one-third or more cash, and the balance in the notes of the purchasers, bearing interest at the rate of 6 per cent, per annum from date until paid, with the usual clauses for the protection of the city for the unpaid part of the purchase price. That, in accordance with the directions of the city council of the city of New Orleans, the comptroller did on June 6, 1902, and on subsequent dates, cause to be advertised in the official journal of the city of New Orleans, to wit, the Daily States, the property seizpd in this case, inviting bids for the purchase of said property upon the terms provided in said ordinance. That on July 7, 1902, the comptroller of the city of New Orleans, acting under the directions of the ordinance aforesaid, submitted his report to the president and members of the city council, in which it was recited that the property herein seized had been advertised for sale and had been offered for sale in the council chamber of the city of New Orleans, that the bids for said property aggregated the sum of $149,000, and submitting the bids so offered for the action of said city council, the ordinance under which said sale was directed reserving to the city to reserve the right to reject any and all bids for said property. Respondents further show that upon the receipt by the city council of the report of the comptroller as aforesaid the same was referred by the council to committee No. 2, known as the \u2018Finance Committee\u2019 of the city council of New Orleans. That the said committee on finance, having considered, as shown by their report to the council, the communication of the comptroller as aforesaid, submitting bids for the property seized herein, reported and recommended that the bids for the said property be rejected, and the sum deposited with the comptroller refunded to George W. Nott, who was the highest bidder for said property, and that the action of said finance committee was approved and adopted by the council. Respondents further show that since the action of the council in rejecting the bids for the property seized herein subsequent efforts were made to sell the same; that said property is in commerce, and held by the city of New Orleans at such prices and on such terms as the city council may see fit and proper; and that the city council have, within the last ten days, made renewed efforts to sell said property; and that, said property being in commerce, it is subject to the payment of the debts of the city of New Orleans, and particularly to the judgment of your respondents, under which judgment execution issued, and which property is now in the custody of the marshal of this court, for sale under the court\u2019s directions and under the law. Wherefore these respondents pray that the restraining order issued herein be vacated and set aside; that the application for an injunction upon the part of the city of New Orleans, so far as it affects the property the subject of this controversy, be denied; that the respondents and plaintiffs in execution be allowed to proceed with their execution in accordance with law, and to satisfy the same by the sale of the property herein sought to be relieved from the operation of the writ of seizure herein; and respondents pray for all further orders and general relief.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b956-5\">\u201cHenry L.

Before me, the undersigned authority, personally came and appeared William Mehle, who, being duly sworn, deposes and says that he is president of the common council of the city of New Orleans, and has been such president for two years past; that the sugar sheds were advertised for sale, as shown by the ordinances to that effect, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"923\">*923</page-number>the council reserving the right to reject any and all bids; that bids were made and rejected; that the sugar sheds are used for the purposes for which they were intended, and form a part of the quay or landing place of the city of New Orleans; that the council has not changed their use, and it is doubtful whether it will do so. It may be that, in order to ascertain the value of this property from time to time, ordinances providing for its sale may be introduced and passed, but unless a very large figure were offered the council would not seriously consider parting with the sheds. Should the council be satisfied with the price, it would then be necessary for it to determine the question whether the property could be dispensed with, and whether it is not indispensable to the public use. Merchants engaged in commerce along the river front claim that the space is already insufficient, and it might be, should the council determine to sell the sheds, that strong representations may be made to it of the necessity for the continued public use of this property; that the council would be bound to declare that it was so necessary to the public use. William Mehle.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b957-4\">\u201cSworn to and subscribed before me, notary, this 4th day of December, 1902.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b957-5\">\u201cBernard O.

Before me, the undersigned authority, personally came and appeared Bernard 0. Shields, who, being duly sworn, deposes and says that he is a member of the council of the city of New Orleans; that he knows the sugar sheds property seized in the suit of Berkson, and knows that it is still used for the purposes for which it was intended, to wit, as sugar sheds to protect sugar in transit in the port of New Orleans; that the council has made a tentative offer to sell this property, but has never withdrawn it from public use; that all bids were rejected some months ago, upon the only proposal the city ever made to sell this property. It may be in the future another attempt will be made to ascertain the real value of this property, not only for sale, but for leasing purposes, but, should the council determine to sell, it would then have to consider its effect upon the commerce of New Orleans. The question would then arise whether the advantage in price would not be more than offset by the disadvantage of the commerce of New Orleans in withdrawing from the public use any dispensable part of the landing. Affiant further says that it is very doubtful whether a sale would be made, even if the terms were satisfactory, but affiant declares that the said property has not been withdrawn from the public use, and that up to this time there has been no intention so to withdraw it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b957-7\">\u201cBernard 0.

Corp. (4th Ed.) 576, 577; Meriwether v. Garrett, 102 U. S. 472, 26 L. Ed. 197; Mayor v. Hopkins, 13 La. 326. But the private property of the corporation \u2014 that is, such as it owns for profit, commerce, or investment, and that is not charged with public trusts or used for public purposes \u2014 may be sold on execution against the corporation. Dillon, Mun. Corp. (4th Ed.) 576; City of New Orleans v. Home Insurance Co., 23 La. Ann. 61. It has already been determined by the highest authority that the property levied on was locus publicus, and not subject to levy and sale (New Orleans v. Louisiana Construction Company, 140 U. S. 654, 11 Sup. Ct. 968, 35 L. Ed. 556); and that determination will be conclusive in this case unless it appears on the final hearing that the property, by proper authority, has been changed to private property held by the city for purposes of commerce, investment, or profit, and not for public purposes, and that it is not charged with public trusts or uses. W\u00e9 mention this not to intimate any opinion, but to indicate that the final decision of this case may depend on the solution of a controverted question of fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b958-5\">In the decree appealed from the Circuit Court has not reached the merits of the case. An injunction pendente lite only has been granted. The court has decided only to preserve the existing conditions till a hearing on the merits. When the case is at issue and the evidence taken the bill may be dismissed or the injunction may be perpetuated. In the decree before us the court has only decided that the plaintiff is entitled to have the defendant enjoined from selling the real estate levied on pending the suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b958-6\">Formerly the granting of an injunction pendente lite was in the absolute discretion of the primary court, inasmuch as its action was not reviewable by appeal. . The act of March 3, 1891, allowed an appeal from such decree. Act March 3, 1891, c. 517, \u00a7 7, 26 Stat. 826 [U. S. Comp. St. 1901, p. 547], amended June 6, 1900, c. 803, \u00a7 7, 31 Stat. 660 [U. S. Comp. St. 1901, p. 551]. But since this act was passed its uniform construction has been that the granting of an injunction pending the suit is in the sound judicial discretion of the trial court, and that its order will not be disturbed on appeal unless it is violative of the rules of equity that have been established for the guidance of its discretion. In some of the cases the same meaning is expressed by saying that the ruling of the trial court in granting the temporary injunction will not be reversed unless there has been an \u201cabuse\u201d of its discretion, and in others it is, said that the decree will not be reversed unless it clearly appears that the injunction has been \u201cimprovidently\u201d allowed. The appellate court is not to decide what it would have done as to allowing the injunction, but it must recognize that the law has imposed on. the trial court the responsibility of the exercise of this power and the duty to exercise this discretion, and unless there has been a plain disregard of some settled rule of equity which should govern the issue of injunctions, so that it appears clearly that the injunction is issued improvidently, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"925\">*925</page-number>the decree should not be reversed. Note to act establishing the Circuit Courts of Appeals (90 Fed. xliv); Proctor &amp; Gamble Co. v. Globe Refining Co., 92 Fed. 357, 34 C. C. A. 405; Dimick v. Shaw, 94 Fed. 266, 36 C. C. A. 347; City of Terre Haute v. Farmers\u2019 Loan &amp; Trust Co., 99 Fed. 838, 40 C. C. A. 117; Lake Shore, etc., Ry. v. Felton, 103 Fed. 227, 43 C. C. A. 189; Bartholomew v. Union Paper Co., 113 Fed. 289, 51 C. C. A. 230; United States Gramophone Co. v. Seaman, 113 Fed. 745, 51 C. C. A. 419; Chickering v. Chickering, 120 Fed. 69, 56 C. C. A. 475; Empire State, etc., Mining Co. v. Bunker Hill, etc., Mining Co., 121 Fed. 973, 58 C. C. A. 311; New Albany Waterworks v. Louisville Banking Co., 122 Fed. 776, 58 C. C. A. 576.</p>\n<p id=\"b959-4\">It is true that on an appeal from such interlocutory decree the appellate court is authorized to look into the merits of the case, and there is a class of cases in which it would be proper for the court to save both parties the expense of further litigation. Where the equity of the bill is challenged, if the appellate court was of opinion that the plaintiff was not entitled to an injunction because his bill had no equity to support it, the court should direct the dismissal of the bill. Smith v. Vulcan Ironworks, 165 U. S. 518, 17 Sup. Ct. 407, 41 L.Ed. 810. But this is clearly not such a case, because here the issues are not yet joined by pleading, and it is indicated by the bill and affidavits and the \u201canswer to the rule\u201d signed by the defendants\u2019 solicitor that the case is one involving controverted questions of fact. In Clark v. McGhee, 87 Fed. 789, 31 C. C. A. 321, this court, speaking by Judge McCormick, asserted its authority in a proper case on such an appeal to decide the case on its merits, but said that \u201cwhere the record is insufficient or incomplete the court will only consider whether the interlocutory order was providently granted.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b959-5\">It is alleged in the bill, which is sworn to by the mayor, that the property levied on is \u201cone of the sugar sheds of the port of New Orleans, and dedicated to public use as such.\u201d Again, it is alleged \u201cthat said property was and is dedicated to public use, and held by your orator for the use and benefit of all the inhabitants of the city of New Orleans, as part of the public quay in .use as a sugar shed, * * *\u201d and that \u201cits destination or character as locus publicus has never been changed.\u201d No answer or plea was filed by the appellants. There is no sworn pleading or affidavit in the record denying the averments of the bill. Such affidavits were admissible., 1 Bates, Fed. Eq. Proc. 534.</p>\n<p id=\"b959-6\">The \u201creturn\u201d made by the defendants (appellants here) to \u201cthe rule to show cause why the injunction should not issue\u201d gives their grounds of contention that the property seized was the subject of seizure and sale under execution. The property was held under a lease, from which the city of New Orleans derived a revenue. On May 19, 1902, the city, acting by its proper officers, directed the comptroller to advertise the property for sale, on terms stated. It was advertised for sale. Bids were made for the property, but the city, having reserved the right to reject all bids, rejected such bids, and did not sell the property. This offer to sell the property, its advertisement, and the report of bids, and their rejection, is shown by exhibits attached to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"926\">*926</page-number>the \u201creturn.\u201d It is also stated in the \u201creturn,\u201d hut not supported by-affidavit or any evidence, that \u201csince the action of the council in rejecting the bids for the property seized herein subsequent efforts were made to sell the same, * * * and that the city council have within the last ten days renewed efforts to sell said property.\u201d The complainant (the appellee here) offered in evidence the affidavits of William Mehle, president of the common council of the city, and of Bernard C. Shields, a member of the council. The affidavit of the former shows the public use of the property, \u201cand that the council has not changed their use, and it is doubtful whether it will do so.\u201d The affidavit of the latter is that \u201cthe council has made a tentative offer to sell the property, but has never withdrawn it from public use; that all bids were rejected some months ago upon the only proposal the city ever made to sell the property.\u201d The bill was the only verified pleading, and the two affidavits and the exhibits to the \u201creturn\u201d the only evidence, before the trial court. The record before us does not show that the injunction pendente lite was improvidently issued.</p>\n<p id=\"b960-5\">The decree of the Circuit Court is affirmed,</p>\n<author id=\"b960-6\">PARDEE, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"AM-\">having granted the restraining order, took no part in the decision of this case.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
