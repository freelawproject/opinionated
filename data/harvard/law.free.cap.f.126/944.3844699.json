UNITED STATES.</parties>\n<court data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"court\" id=\"b978-7\">(Circuit Court of Appeals, Second Circuit.</court>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"AJa\">September 16, 1903.)</decisiondate>\n<docketnumber data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"docketnumber\" id=\"b978-8\">No. 191.</docketnumber>\n<syllabus data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b978-9\">1. Fraudulent Use of Mails \u2014 Sentence\u2014Consolidation of Indictments.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b978-10\">The consolidation of three indictments, each charging a separate offense of using the mails to defraud, all committed in the same six months, does not, on conviction of all the offenses, prevent a sentence for each of them, under Rev. St \u00a7 5480 [U. S. Comp. St. 1901, p. 3696], providing that an indictment may charge three such offenses committed in the same six months, but the court thereon shall give a single sentence.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b978-11\">1f 1. Use of mails for frauds and counterfeiting, see note to Timmons v. United States, 30 C. C. A. 86. .</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b978-12\">See Post Office, vol. 40, Cent Dig. \u00a7 90.</syllabus>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b979-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"945\">*945</page-number>On Rehearing.</summary>\n<seealso data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"seealso\" id=\"Ais\">For former opinion, see 123 Fed. 849.</seealso>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b979-4\">Before WARRACE, RACOMBE, and COXE, Circuit Judges.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b979-5\">PER CURIAM.</author>\n<p id=\"A6h\">A rehearing is asked for on two grounds: (1) Because the decision is in conflict with In re De Bara, 179 U. S. 316, 21 Sup. Ct. 110, 45 L. Ed. 207; and (2) because this court \u201ccannot have considered the point taken in the brief filed in this cause, that the sentence imposed was authorized by law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b979-6\">Although the \u201cpoint taken in the brief\u201d comprised only a dozen lines referring to Howard v. United States, 75 Fed. 986, 21 C. C. A. 586, 34 R. R. A. 509, it was not overlooked. We discussed the proposition at considerable length, and set forth quite fully the reasons which persuaded us to the conclusion that the \u201csingle sentence\u201d of section 5480, Rev. St. [U. S. Comp. St. 1901, p. 3696], meant a single sentence not exceeding the limits specified in the section for a single offense. With section 1024 [U. S. Comp. St. 1901, p. 720] already on the statute book, it is difficult to understand why Congress inserted the amendment as to including three offenses in a single indictment, unless it intended thus to restrict the single sentence for those three offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b979-7\">The De Bara Case was not cited on the briefs of either side, and was overlooked by us. It seems to be in conflict with our conclusion; the petition for rehearing is therefore granted.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
