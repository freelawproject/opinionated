We conclude that it does not and thus affirm the decision of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-11\">I. FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b558-12\">Defendants John Nathaniel Ladson and Eunice Mae Oliver lived in a rented house at 5864 Deerfield Trail in College Park, Georgia. The owner of the house was Rowland Allen. In March of 1984, the government commenced civil forfeiture proceedings against the house, charging that the property was traceable to drug profits obtained by Allen and hence subject to forfeiture under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 881(a)(6). Soon thereafter, at the government\u2019s request, Judge Robert J. Hall of the United States District Court for the Northern District of Alabama issued an order entitled \u201cseizure warrant/writ of entry.\u201d The warrant ordered seizure of Allen\u2019s real property and directed the executing federal agent to \u201cprepare a written inventory of the real estate and property thereon seized.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b558-18\">The executing agent turned out to be Special Agent Paul Markonni of the Drug Enforcement Administration.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Markonni arrived at the property along with three police officers and found Oliver at home. Over her protest, two of the officers began to conduct a \u201cwalk-through\u201d inventory of the home\u2019s contents. Minutes later, the officers called Markonni into the bedroom. There, Markonni saw in plain view what he believed to be drugs and drug paraphernalia. A field test indicated the presence of cocaine. Markonni arrested Oliver, obtained a search warrant, and in the ensuing search discovered further suspected contraband.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-19\">After Oliver and Ladson were indicted on several drug charges, they moved to suppress the evidence discovered in their home. The district court held the evidence inadmissible under the fourth amendment exclusionary rule. A week later, the government moved for reconsideration on the basis of the \u201cgood faith\u201d exception to the exclusionary rule. The district court denied the motion, and this appeal followed. We have jurisdiction under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3731.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b559-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b559-5\">A. <em>The Plain View Exception</em></p>\n<p id=\"b559-6\">Agent Markonni had no warrant entitling him to search for or seize the evidence originally discovered, and the warrant under which the additional evidence was found was obtained on the basis of the original evidence. Thus, the exclusionary rule and the \u201cfruit of the poisonous tree\u201d doctrine require us to affirm the district court\u2019s decision to suppress all the evidence unless Agent Markonni\u2019s original discovery falls within an exception to the fourth amendment\u2019s warrant requirement. The government contends that the evidence is admissible under the \u201cplain view\u201d exception, which is applicable if three conditions are met. First, the initial intrusion which made the discovery possible must have been lawful. Second, the discovery must have been inadvertent. Finally, it must have been immediately apparent that the item was evidence, contraband or otherwise subject to seizure. <em>United States v. Kent, </em>691 F.2d 1376, 1382 (11th Cir.1982), <em>cert. denied, </em>462 U.S. 1119, 103 S.Ct. 3086, 77 L.Ed.2d 1348 (1983); <em>see Coolidge v. New Hampshire, </em>403 U.S. 443, 465-73, 91 S.Ct. 2022, 2037-42, 29 L.Ed.2d 564 (1971) (plurality opinion).</p>\n<p id=\"b559-7\">The parties agree that the second and third requirements were fulfilled. Thus, the only question before us is whether Agent Markonni\u2019s initial entry into the defendants\u2019 home was lawful. The government, contending that it was, first argues that the entry was authorized by the \u201cseizure warrant/writ of entry\u201d issued by Judge Hall. It next contends that as custodian of the house during the forfeiture proceeding, the government had the right to inventory household furnishings and inspect for damage. Finally, it suggests that it had the authority as custodian to exercise the contractual right of Allen, the owner, to inspect the premises. We reject all three contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-9\">1. Nothing in the seizure warrant issued by Judge Hall expressly authorized the government to enter the house without permission. Thus, the government is constrained to argue in brief that \u201cin order to perform the inventory as ordered by the court, the agents obviously had to conduct a brief \u2018walk-though\u2019 [sic] of the house.\u201d We disagree. Properly understood, Judge Hall\u2019s order required nothing more than a cursory examination of the lot. The warrant authorized seizure of Allen\u2019s <em>real estate </em>and ordered an inventory of the \u201cproperty ... <em>seized </em>\u201d (emphasis added). It would have been a simple matter to inventory the <em>seized </em>property \u2014 that is, the real estate and improvements on it \u2014 from outside the house. Although it is true that Agent Markonni could not inventory the <em>contents </em>of the house without entering, that property was not subject to seizure, and the warrant did not authorize an inventory of property not seized. The government thus cannot rely upon the seizure warrant to legitimate Markonni\u2019s initial entry.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b559-10\">2. The government\u2019s contention that it could legally enter the house to inventory furnishings and inspect for damage even without a warrant is also untenable. As the Drug Enforcement Administration (\u201cDEA\u201d) is well aware,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> the fourth <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>amendment applies to searches for administrative purposes as well as searches in the criminal context. \u201cThe showing of probable cause necessary to secure a warrant may vary ..., but the necessity for the warrant persists.\u201d <em>Michigan v. Tyler, </em>436 U.S. 499, 506, 98 S.Ct. 1942, 1948, 56 L.Ed.2d 486 (1978). There are, of course, \u201ccertain carefully defined classes of cases\u201d to which the warrant requirement does not apply. <em>Camara v. Municipal Court, </em>387 U.S. 523, 528, 87 S.Ct. 1727, 1730, 18 L.Ed.2d 930 (1967). Where the privacy of the home is involved, however, there is only <em>one </em>type of case in which a warrant is not required. Because the protection of private dwellings lies at the very heart of the fourth amendment, <em>\u201conly exigent circumstances </em>will justify a warrantless intrusion into a home.\u201d <em>United States v. Parr, </em>716 F.2d 796, 814 (11th Cir.1983) (emphasis added) (citing <em>Payton v. New York, </em>445 U.S. 573, 590, 100 S.Ct. 1371, 1382, 63 L.Ed.2d 639 (1980)).</p>\n<p id=\"b560-6\">The government does not argue, and could not reasonably contend, that exigent circumstances sufficient to justify a war-rantless entry were present in this case. Under <em>Parr, </em>that should end the matter. Nevertheless, the government asks us to uphold Agent Markonni\u2019s entry under the \u201cinventory search\u201d exception to the warrant requirement. <em>Parr </em>requires us to refuse. Besides concluding that <em>only </em>exigent circumstances may justify a warrantless home search, we specifically declined in <em>Parr </em>to extend the inventory exception to such a search. We refused in that case to use the exception \u201cas a bootstrap to undermine the Fourth Amendment protections afforded the sanctity of the home,\u201d <em>id., </em>and we likewise refuse to do so here.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b560-7\">3. The government\u2019s supposed right as custodian to exercise the landlord's prerogative to enter makes a no more appealing bootstrap. First, the argument is clearly pretextual. Agent Markonni never claimed that he entered the house to inspect the premises, and there is no evidence to suggest that he did so. The intrusion in this case cannot be justified on the ground that an intrusion for some other purpose might have been lawful. Second, nothing in the rental agreement gave the landlord the right to force his way onto the premises over the tenant\u2019s objection. If the tenant refused entry, the landlord would have had to seek a court order. Thus, the rental agreement could not have given Agent Markonni the right to gain entry by resort to self-help rather than a judicial decree.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-12\">We do not hold that the government may never have good reason to inspect a seized house and conduct an inventory of its contents. We hold only that absent exigent circumstances, the government must follow the advice in the DEA\u2019s own Guide to Forfeiture of Assets: if probable cause exists to enter the premises, obtain a warrant. <em>See supra </em>note 5. Any other rule would permit government agents to circumvent the safeguards provided by the fourth amendment in any case involving the seizure of real estate. Such a result is particularly unappealing where, as here, it would sanction warrantless governmental intrusions into the homes of third parties unrelated to the original seizure.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-13\">B. <em>The Good Faith Exception</em></p>\n<p id=\"ADG\">The government\u2019s contention that the evidence in question is admissible under the good faith exception to the exclusionary rule was raised for the first time before the district court in a motion for reconsideration. Judicial economy requires that prosecutors make their evidentiary arguments before judgment or not at all, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>unless there is a reasonable justification for raising a new issue in a post-judgment motion. <em>United States v. Thompson, </em>710 F.2d 1500, 1504 (11th Cir.1983), <em>cert. denied, </em>464 U.S. 1050, 104 S.Ct. 730, 79 L.Ed.2d 190 (1984), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 105 S.Ct. 2333, 85 L.Ed.2d 850 (1985). The government\u2019s justification in this case is that the Supreme Court cases adopting the exception, <em>United States v. Leon, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 104 S.Ct. 3405, 82 L.Ed.2d 677 (1984), and <em>Massachusetts v. Sheppard, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 104 S.Ct. 3424, 82 L.Ed.2d 737 (1984), were decided too late for the good faith argument to be made any earlier than it was. In reality, however, the two cases were handed down more than a month before the suppression hearing. Furthermore, the good faith exception has been the law of this circuit since its creation. <em>See United States v. Williams, </em>622 F.2d 830 (5th Cir.1980) (en banc), <em>cert. denied, </em>449 U.S. 1127, 101 S.Ct. 946, 67 L.Ed.2d 114 (1981). We thus find the proffered excuse too weak to justify our consideration of the government\u2019s untimely argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-12\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b558-14\">. There is no disagreement among the parties as to the facts.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b558-15\">. Agent Markonni had not previously been involved with the Allen case, but he had participated in an investigation of alleged drug dealing by Ladson. Ladson and Oliver suggest that Markonni\u2019s participation in the seizure of the house, which he knew to be Ladson\u2019s residence, may have been more than mere coincidence. Because we hold Markonni\u2019s entry into the house unlawful on other grounds, we need not reach this issue.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b558-20\">. Ladson and Oliver contend that this appeal is untimely under Fed.R.App.P. 4(b). We disagree. Although the government's notice of appeal was not filed within 30 days from the entry of judgment as is normally required by Rule 4(b), the 30 day period runs anew from the denial of a motion for reconsideration. <em>United States v. Dieter, </em>429 U.S. 6, 97 S.Ct. 18, 50 L.Ed.2d 8 (1976). Ladson and Oliver contend that <em>Dieter </em>does not apply here because the government's motion dealt exclusively with a new issue \u2014 the good faith exception to the exclusionary rule \u2014 and thus did not ask the court to re-consider anything. In fact, however, the motion did ask the court to reconsider something: its ultimate holding on the suppression issue. In the alternative, the appellees argue <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>that the appeal period ran from the denial of the government\u2019s motion with respect to the good faith issue, but for all other issues continued to run from the original decision and hence expired before the notice of appeal was filed. <em>Dieter, </em>however, indicates otherwise. In that case, as in this one, the motion for rehearing was based only on new arguments. Nevertheless, the Court held the appeal timely and remanded the case without limiting further proceedings to the issues presented in the motion. The rule Ladson and Oliver suggest would present future appellants with a choice of two evils: either ask the district court to reconsider every appealable issue, even when to do so would surely be fruitless, or lose the benefit of <em>Dieter. </em>We decline to introduce additional complications into the lives of would-be appellants.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b559-13\">. We do not hold that Judge Hall could not have authorized entry into the home if presented with probable cause sufficient to support a warrant, but only that he did not do so in this instance.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b559-14\">. The DEA\u2019s own forfeiture manual states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b559-15\">The owners or occupants [of seized real property] do not automatically lose their privacy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>rights in the premises pending the outcome of the forfeiture. Nor do they lose their privacy rights as to their personal property stored on the premises____ If probable cause exists to search the premises, obtain a separate search warrant.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b560-14\">H.
