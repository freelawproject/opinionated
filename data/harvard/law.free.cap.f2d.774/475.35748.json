We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-15\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b596-16\">Cobb was one of two women who shared the position of an Equal Opportunity Specialist, Regional Administrator, GM-14 grade level, as a permanent part-time employee for the Women\u2019s Bureau in San Francisco, California. Effective November 19, 1983, the Bureau undertook a RIF in which the two part-time Regional Administrator positions were abolished. One full-time Regional Administrator position was created allegedly to decrease the costs and to remove those management attributes associated with the job sharing arrangement. Cobb concededly was a competing service employee under 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 351, <em>et seq. </em>(1983) and eligible for retention and assignment rights under the regulations. However, the Bureau determined that there were no available positions into which Cobb could be placed and therefore separated her.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-17\">Cobb appealed her separation to the Board. Cobb asserted to the Board that the Bureau\u2019s reasons for the RIF were personal to her, pretextual and in disregard of the congressional policy set forth in the Federal Employees Part-Time Career Employment Act of 1978. Alternatively, she asserted that if the RIF was instituted for a proper reason, the Bureau was required to offer her the full-time Regional Administrator position. The full Board affirmed the presiding official\u2019s determination that the RIF was conducted for a proper reason under 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 351.201(a) (1983) and that the Bureau had not erred by not offering the full-time Regional Administrator position to Cobb.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-18\">OPINION</p>\n<p id=\"b596-19\">This court has jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1295(a)(9) to hear an appeal pursu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>ant to 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7703(b)(1). Our scope of review is limited by 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7703(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b597-4\">The regulations by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) are promulgated pursuant to authority granted by 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 3502(a), which reads in pertinent part: \u201cThe Office of Personnel Management shall prescribe regulations for the release of competing employees in a reduction in force....\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 3502(a) (1982). OPM RIF regulations and instructions appear in 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 351, <em>et seq. </em>and the Federal Personnel Manual (FPM), Chapter 351, respectively.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-5\">An agency is to follow the RIF regulations \u201cwhen the release is required because of lack of work, shortage of funds, <em>reorganization. ...\u201d </em>5 C.F.R. \u00a7 351.201(a) (1983) (emphasis added). Here, the Bureau asserts that it conducted a proper reorganization and dealt with Cobb as prescribed by the appropriate regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-6\">Consequently, we must begin our review by answering whether this \u201creorganization\u201d was properly within the scope of the RIF regulations. Looking to the controlling regulations, OPM defines a reorganization as \u201cthe planned elimination, addition, or redistribution of functions or duties in an organization.\u201d 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 203(f) (1983). The agency bears the evidentiary burden of proving that RIF regulations were properly invoked due to management considerations of the character appropriately committed to agency discretion. The agency must support its decision by a preponderance of the evidence. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7701(c)(1)(B) (1982). Yet, \u201can agency is accorded wide discretion in conducting a reduction in force; absent a clear abuse of that discretion, a substantial departure from applicable procedures, a misconstruction of governing statutes, or the like, we do not upset a final agency decision.\u201d <em>Cooper v. Tennessee Valley Authority, </em>723 F.2d 1560, 1562 (Fed.Cir.1983); <em>see also, Bacon v. Dept. of Housing &amp; Urban Development, </em>757 F.2d 265, 268 (Fed.Cir.1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b597-8\">While the term \u201creorganization\u201d is defined broadly enough to cover a multitude of management considerations, it is not an enchanted blanket that can be used to cover improper agency action. <em>Fitzgerald v. Hampton, </em>467 F.2d 755, 758 (D.C.Cir.1972). Cobb argues that the improper agency action occurred when the Bureau failed to consider the public policy goals stated in the Federal Employees Part-Time Career Employment Act of 1978 and thereby abused its managerial discretion in conducting the RIF.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-9\">Reviewing this legislation we find no directives in the Act or in any discussion in the Act\u2019s history concerning what attributes of a permanent part-time position are to be considered when there is to be a reduction-in-force due to an agency\u2019s reorganization. In addition, OPM\u2019s regulations interpreting the Act, 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 340, <em>et seq., </em>do not specifically address whether there is an <em>elimination </em>within the scope of the term \u201creorganization\u201d when a job shared position is transformed into a single employee position.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-10\">Since RIFs are not aimed at removing particular individuals, but at eliminating positions, <em>Grier v. Dept. of Health and Human Services, </em>750 F.2d 944, 945 (Fed.Cir.1984), it is clear that a change in organizational structure such as in this case was not a \u00a7 203 reorganization; that is, there was no elimination, addition, or redistribution of functions or duties in the organization. The Bureau made no changes in the description of the Regional Administrator position when eliminating this position as one available for job sharing. The education and experience requirements as well as the duties and responsibilities of the full-time position were identical to those of the job shared position. The Regional Administrator\u2019s position was merely made a full-time position rather than a job shared position. To do no more than assert that changing a job sharing arrangement to a single full-time position is a proper reorganization, is to circumvent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>the established merit principles of 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 2301.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-4\">Our interpretation is confirmed by the current FPM provisions which set forth how OPM currently deals with a job shared position in an organization\u2019s structure. Federal Personnel Manual, Chapter 340 (1985). The FPM defines job sharing as a \u201cform of part-time employment in which the tours of duty of two (or more) employees are arranged in such a way as to cover a single full-time position.\u201d Federal Personnel Manual, Chapter 340-l-5(a) (1985). Moreover, OPM permits \u201c[a] job sharing team [to] apply for a full-time position under agency merit promotion programs but the qualifications of each job sharer should be evaluated individually____ A job sharer may also apply individually for a promotion to a part-time or full-time position____\u201d <em>Id. </em>340-1-5(f).</p>\n<p id=\"b598-9\">More importantly, however, are the OPM instructions concerning a position change. The FPM provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b598-10\">A part-time employee is covered by an agency\u2019s merit promotion program and should be reassigned, detailed or promoted in accordance with such programs in the same way and under the same circumstances as other career or career-conditional employees. <em>Movement from a \u25a0part-time to a full-time position is not subject to competition </em>unless required by the procedures in FPM chapter 335 governing promotion and internal placement.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b598-11\"><em>Id. </em>Chapter 340-1-10 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b598-12\">Based upon the foregoing, we find that the Bureau\u2019s determination that this organization structure change was a reorganization within the meaning of RIF regulations 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 351, <em>et seq. </em>was an abuse of agency discretion. This conclusion makes it unnecessary for us to consider petitioner\u2019s additional contentions. The decision of the Board is, accordingly, reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-13\">REVERSED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
