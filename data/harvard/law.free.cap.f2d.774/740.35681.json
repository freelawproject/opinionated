Cass, Jr. and Frederic E. Saunders<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> were employees of Electric Cord Sets, Inc. In 1959 Electric Cord established a pension plan and related trust. In 1959, and again in 1963 upon the plan\u2019s amendment, the Commissioner of Internal Revenue (Commissioner) issued letters determining that the plan was \u201cqualified\u201d under \u00a7 401(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 401(a), and the trust was therefore exempt from tax under \u00a7 501(a) of the Code, 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 501(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b861-14\">On July 18, 1978, Electric Cord terminated the plan effective for the plan year ending December 31, 1977. In 1978 the trustees distributed the plan\u2019s assets to the participants, including taxpayers Cass and Saunders. Cass and Saunders then \u201crolled over\u201d their distributions to individual retirement accounts (IRAs) relying on the tax-free rollover provisions of \u00a7 402(a)(5) of the Code. There had been no employee contributions.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-15\">In 1979 the plan and the trust were examined by the Commissioner. Based on this examination it was determined that the plan discriminated among salaried employees. A preliminary letter proposing revocation of the plan\u2019s qualified status under \u00a7 401(a), and the trust\u2019s exempt status under \u00a7 501(a), was issued by the Commissioner in September, 1979. On February 15, 1980 the Commissioner revoked the plan\u2019s qualified status and the trust\u2019s exempt status retroactively, effective as of January 1, 1976. Thus, when employer contributions were made in 1976 and 1977 and when the terminating distributions were made in 1978, the plan was not a tax-qualified plan and the trust was not exempt.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-16\">On audit the Commissioner determined that since the plan was not qualified at the date of distribution, the distributions from the trust in 1978 should have been reported as ordinary income and were ineligible for tax-free rollover treatment under \u00a7 402(a)(5) of the Code. The Commissioner also determined that the full amounts that the taxpayers had transferred into IRAs constituted \u201cexcess contributions\u201d and thus were subject to the 6% excise tax of \u00a7 4973(a) of the Code.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b861-17\">In the Tax Court taxpayers did not contest the Commissioner\u2019s determination that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"742\">*742</page-number>the plan was not qualified, nor the retroactive revocation of qualified status. They argued, however, that the tax treatment of the distributions should not be determined by the status of the plan at the time of distribution, but at the date of contributions to the trust. Thus, they argued that that portion of the distribution attributable to contributions made prior to January 1, 1976 should be entitled to the tax-free rollover treatment of \u00a7 402(a)(5).</p>\n<p id=\"b862-4\">The Tax Court agreed, holding that to the extent each 1978 distribution was attributable to pre-disqualification contributions, the amount thereof was to be treated as having been rolled over tax-free under \u00a7 402(a)(5), and not excess contribution to an IRA under \u00a7 4973. The remainder was treated as ordinary income under \u00a7 402(b). <em>Benbow v. Commissioner, </em>82 T.C. 941 (1984). The Commissioner appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-5\">But for the rollover claimed to be authorized by \u00a7 402(a)(5), and giving the disqualification retroactive effect, the distributions would be includible in taxpayers' gross incomes for 1978. Section 402(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b862-6\">Section 402(a)(5) provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b862-7\">(5) ROLLOVER AMOUNTS\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b862-8\">(A) GENERAL RULE. \u2014 if\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b862-9\">(1) the balance to the credit of an employee in a <em>qualified trust </em>is to be paid to him in a qualifying rollover distribution,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b862-10\">(ii) the employee transfers any portion of the property he receives in such distribution to an eligible retirement plan, and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b862-11\">(iii) in the case of a distribution other than money, the amount so transferred consists of the property distributed, then such distribution (to the extent so transferred) shall not be includible in gross income for the taxable year in which paid.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b862-15\">(D) DEFINITIONS. \u2014 For purposes of this paragraph\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b862-16\">(iii) QUALIFIED TRUST. \u2014 The term \u201cqualified trust\u201d means an employees\u2019 trust described in Section 401(a) <em>which is exempt from tax under section 501(a).</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b862-17\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b862-18\">The Commissioner maintains that on its face the text of \u00a7 402(a)(5) requires that for a distribution from an employee benefit trust to receive the benefits of tax-free rollover treatment, the trust must be one \u201cwhich <em>is </em>exempt under Section 501(a)\u201d at the time of distribution. (Emphasis added.) We agree that this is the ordinary, clear meaning of the terms employed.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-19\">In <em>Woodson v. C.I.R., </em>651 F.2d 1094 (5th Cir.1981), the Fifth Circuit similarly interpreted \u00a7 402(a)(2) of the Code.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Section 402(a)(2) provides that, to a limited extent, a recipient of a lump sum distribution from an employee trust may treat a portion of the total taxable amount as capital gain rather than ordinary income. Sections 402(a)(2) and 402(a)(5) contain identical statutory requirements concerning the status of the trust necessary for the preferential tax treatment provided, <em>i.e., </em>that it be one \u201cwhich is exempt from tax under Section 501(a).\u201d The parties agree there is no meaningful difference between these provisions. In <em>Woodson, </em>the Fifth Circuit held that \u201c[s]ection 402(a)(2) explicitly limits <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"743\">*743</page-number>capital gains treatment of \u2018lump sum distributions\u2019 to instances in which the <em>distribution </em>flows from an employee trust \u2018which <em>is </em>exempt from tax under section 501(a).\u2019 \u201d 651 F.2d at 1095. The court noted that to uphold the Tax Court\u2019s <em>Woodson </em>decision, which held that the trust\u2019s status at the date of contribution \u2014 rather than at the date of distribution \u2014 controlled eligibility for capital gains treatment, it \u201cwould have to interpret \u2018is exempt\u2019 to mean \u2018is or has been exempt\u2019 and to read \u2018which forms a part of a plan\u2019 [26 U.S.C. \u00a7 402(e)(4)(A) (definition of lump sum distribution)]<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> to say \u2018which forms or has formed a part of a plan.\u2019 \u201d 651 F.2d at 1095. The court also noted that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b863-4\">to uphold the tax court\u2019s ruling would abrogate a Treasury Regulation on point, which states unambiguously: \u201cThe provisions of section 402(a) relate only to a distribution by a trust described in Section 401(a) which is exempt under Section 501(a) for the taxable year of the trust in which distribution is made.\u201d Section 1.402(a)-1(a)(1)(ii).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b863-5\">651 F.2d at 1096.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-6\">In <em>Woodson, </em>the Fifth Circuit declined to follow a 1966 Second Circuit decision, <em>Greenwald v. C.I.R., </em>366 F.2d 538 (2d Cir.1966) which had reached the opposite conclusion. 651 F.2d at 1095 n. 3. The Treasury Regulation, quoted in <em>Woodson, </em>had not been referred to in <em>Greenwald.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b863-7\">The Tax Court, though divided, has refused to follow <em>Woodson. See Baetens v. Commissioner, </em>82 T.C. 152, 155 (1984), appeal docketed, No. 84-1471 (6th Cir.). It continues to adhere to its court-reviewed opinion in <em>Woodson v. Commissioner, </em>73 T.C. 779 (1980), rev\u2019d. 651 F.2d 1094 (5th Cir.1981) and <em>Greenwald v. C.I.R., </em>366 F.2d 538 (2d Cir.1966). Because in our case the Tax Court relied on its opinion in <em>Baetens, </em>we will direct our remarks to the opinion in that case.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-10\">The court in <em>Baetens </em>agreed that the critical statutory language at issue is \u201cwhich is exempt from tax under section 501(a)\u201d but concluded that \u201c[t]his language is clear as to the \u2018what\u2019 but not as to the \u2018when,\u2019 \u201d <em>i.e., </em>clear as to the status requirement but not as to the time such status must exist. To resolve this alleged ambiguity in the language of \u00a7 402(a) the court looked to \u00a7 402(b). Section 402(b) deals with distributions from non-qualified plans. It provides that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b863-11\">[Contributions to an employees\u2019 trust made by an employer during a taxable year of the employer which ends within or with a taxable year of the trust for which the trust is not exempt from tax under \u00a7 501(a) shall be included in the gross income of the employee____ The amount actually distributed or made available to any distributee by any such trust shall be taxable to him in the year in which so distributed____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b863-15\">26 U.S.C. \u00a7 402(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b863-16\">If a nonexempt trust becomes exempt in a later year and then makes a distribution, the distribution is not taxed as if it were a distribution solely from an exempt trust. If it were so treated taxpayers would be taxed twice on the amounts of contributions made while the trust was not exempt \u2014 once when the contributions were made under \u00a7 402(b) and again at the time of distribution under \u00a7 402(a). Instead, the contributions to the trust that were included in the employee\u2019s income at the time the trust was nonexempt are deemed to give the taxpayer a basis against which to offset the amount of the later distribution. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1.402(a)-1(a)(1)(iv), Income Tax Regulations. \u201cThus, the status of the trust at the time the contributions were made determines the way that this distribution is taxed.\u201d 82 T.C. at 166.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-17\">The Tax Court concluded that it would be a \u201csymmetrical result,\u201d harmonizing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"744\">*744</page-number>\u00a7\u00a7 402(a) and (b), to hold that where an exempt trust later becomes non-exempt, the status of the trust at the time the contributions were made should also determine the tax treatment of the distribution. Because \u00a7 402(b) contemplates a determination whether a trust is exempt or not for each year in which contributions are made in order to decide whether contributions are included in gross income of the employee for that year, the Tax Court concluded that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b864-4\">the benefits of qualification also attach on a year-by-year basis rather than just in the year of distribution____ \u201cTo hold otherwise would create a rule of law that would penalize the innocent employee who had no say in the management of the trust and retroactively change the ground rules that he would fairly have anticipated would govern the taxability of payments to him.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b864-7\">82 T.C. at 167 (quoting <em>Woodson v. Commissioner, </em>73 T.C. at 784).</p>\n<p id=\"b864-8\">We do not agree with the Tax Court\u2019s conclusion that the language \u201cwhich is exempt from tax under Section 501(a)\u201d is ambiguous as to when exempt status must exist for a distribution to qualify for tax-free rollover treatment. Section 402(a)(5) explicitly limits tax-free rollover treatment to instances in which the <em>distribution </em>flows from an employee trust \u201cwhich <em>is </em>exempt from tax under Section 501(a).\u201d As we read the relevant provisions, they grant beneficiaries of employee trusts exempt under \u00a7 501(a) deferral of income tax on employer contributions and trust income while the plan is \u201cqualified.\u201d 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 402(a). To realize the additional benefit of tax-free rollover treatment under \u00a7 402(a)(5) the trust must be exempt at the date of distribution. Any extension of the favored treatment specifically provided for in \u00a7 402(a)(5) is a function for the Congress, not the Courts. <em>Cf., Gunnison v. C.I.R., </em>461 F.2d 496, 499 (7th Cir.1972); <em>Woodson v. C.I.R., </em>651 F.2d 1094, 1096 (5th Cir.1981); <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>331 F.2d 943, 954 (5th Cir.1964).</p>\n<p id=\"b864-9\">The substance of what the Tax Court has done, it seems to us, is to separate a distribution made on termination of a trust which is not exempt at the time of distribution into components. One component represents employer contributions in earlier years when the trust was exempt (presumably augmented by trust income during those years). That component is treated, for the purpose of \u00a7 402(a)(5) as if the trust \u201cis\u201d exempt at the time of distribution. Other components of the same distribution are treated as is the fact, <em>i.e., </em>the trust is not exempt. We think this division into qualified and unqualified components and treatment of the former as a distribution of a trust which \u201cis\u201d exempt clearly exceeds the bounds of statutory interpretation.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-10\">The Tax Court notes that the Commissioner\u2019s position results in the \u201cbunching\u201d of taxable income and impairs the ability of individuals to plan for retirement. In response to hardship considerations the Commissioner points out that income averaging tends to alleviate the problem of bunched income, and that in any event, a taxpayer may well prefer deferral of tax during the years the trust was exempt even if bunching of income occurs in a later year. Any hardship in the assessment of an excise tax because a rollover thought to be authorized when made turns out to have been improper results from the retroactive effect of disqualification, not challenged here. The Tax Court in this case noted the possibility of \u201crelief from this [excise] tax in one situation where the excess contributions may have been inadvertent. Sections 4973(b)(2)(B) and 408(d)(5)....\u201d It happens here that the parties were able to agree on the amount of money to be allocated to the respective components of the distribution. The Commissioner points out that in many legally indistinguishable situations, particularly those involving defined-benefit plans, the Tax Court\u2019s holding will create \u201cintractable\u201d computational problems, requiring devising rules and formulae for solution. As acknowledged by the Tax Court in this case, \u201c[w]e do not have precedent as to how to compute the amount of the \u2018quali<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"745\">*745</page-number>fied assets\u2019 <em>(Baetens v. Commissioner, </em>82 T.C. at 170) of a defined benefit plan.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b865-5\">Whatever the appropriate balance of all these considerations, viewed in the context of legislation, we find no demonstrable Congressional purpose so clearly frustrated by a straightforward reading of \u00a7 402(a)(5) as to legitimatize the result reached by the Tax Court in the name of statutory interpretation.</p>\n<p id=\"b865-6\">Having interpreted \u00a7 402(a)(5) as providing that the trust\u2019s status at the date of contribution \u2014 rather than at the date of distribution \u2014 determines eligibility for tax-free rollover treatment, the Tax Court, in <em>Baetens, </em>held Treas.Reg. \u00a7 1.402(a)-1(a)(1)(ii) invalid, finding it \u201cout of harmony with the statute and unreasonable.\u201d 82 T.C. at 165.</p>\n<p id=\"b865-7\">Section 1.402(a)-1(a)(1)(ii) states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b865-8\">The provisions of section 402(a) relate only to a distribution by a trust described in section 401(a) which is exempt under section 501(a) for the taxable year of the trust in which the distribution is made.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b865-9\">}|c sjc j|s s\u00a1s</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b865-10\">Despite the clear and unambiguous language of the treasury regulation and its consistency with the language of the statute itself, the <em>Baetens </em>court noted,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b865-11\">[w]e doubt that this regulation addresses the problem before the Court, since section 1.402(a)-1(a)(1)(v), Income Tax Regs., expressly provides: \u201cIf the trust is not exempt at the time the distribution is received by or made available to the employee, see section 402(b) and paragraph (b) of sec. 1.402(b)-1.\u201d Thereafter, section 1.402(b)-1(b)(1), Income Tax Regs., provides:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b865-12\">When an employees\u2019 trust that was exempt under section 501(a) ceases to be so exempt, an employee shall include in his gross income only amounts <em>contributed </em>to the trust during a taxable year of the employer that ends within or with a taxable year of the trust in which not so exempt (to the same extent as if the trust had not been so exempt in all prior taxable years).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b865-15\">These two regulations promulgated much later than section 1.402(a)-1(a)(1)(ii) could be viewed as conflicting with the earlier regulation or all of these regulations can be viewed as not squarely addressing the problem before the Court.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ae6\">82 T.C. at 163-64 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b865-16\">The two treasury regulations cited by the <em>Baetens </em>court do not in our opinion conflict with Treas.Reg. \u00a7 1.402(a)-1(a)(1)(ii) nor render it ambiguous or inapplicable. Section 1.402(b)-1(b)(1) clearly deals with the tax treatment of sums <em>contributed </em>to an ongoing trust which becomes non-exempt after being exempt, not with distributions from such a trust. Treasury Regulation \u00a7 1.402(b)-1(c)(1), T.D. 7554, 1978-2 C.B. 71, 85-87, formerly numbered 1.402(b)-1(b)(1),<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b865-17\">Taxation of distribution from a trust not exempt under section 501(a) \u2014 Any amount actually distributed or made available to any distributee by an employees\u2019 trust which is not exempt under section 501(a) for the taxable year of the trust in which the distribution is made shall be taxable in the year in which so distributed or made available.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b865-18\">Thus Treas.Reg. \u00a7\u00a7 1.402(a)-1(a)(1)(ii) and 1.402(b)\u20141(c)(1) together leave no doubt that a distribution from a trust that is not exempt in the year of distribution is taxed under \u00a7 402(b) and is not eligible for the favorable tax treatment provided in \u00a7 402(a). Treasury Regulation \u00a7 1.402(a)-1(a)(1)(ii) is \u201csquarely in accord with the plain, limiting language of the statute,\u201d <em>Woodson v. C.I.R., </em>651 F.2d at 1096, and we consider it valid.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"746\">*746</page-number>Accordingly, the judgment below is Reversed, and the cause Remanded to the Tax Court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b861-11\">.

It would seem logical, giving full retroactive effect to the Commissioner\u2019s disqualification of the trust, to have determined deficiencies for 1976 and 1977, based on the taxability to these taxpayers of the employer\u2019s contributions to a non-exempt trust.
