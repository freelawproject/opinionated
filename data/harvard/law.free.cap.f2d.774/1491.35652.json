Weygandt, a Washington state prisoner, appeals the district court\u2019s denial of his petition for writ of habeas corpus. Weygandt contends that he was denied effective assistance of counsel in violation of his right to a fair trial. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1608-20\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b1608-21\">BACKGROUND,.</p>\n<p id=\"b1608-22\">Weygandt was convicted in 1977 of second degree murder in the shooting death of Jamie Grimes at the Red Lion Tavern in Anacortes, Washington.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The Court of Appeals of Washington affirmed Weygandt\u2019s conviction. <em>State v. Weygandt, </em>20 Wash.App. 599, 608, 581 P.2d 1376, 1381 (1978). Washington state courts denied Weygandt\u2019s petitions for post-conviction relief.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Weygandt then filed a pro se petition for a writ of habeas corpus in district court challenging his conviction on several grounds, including ineffective assistance of counsel. The district court denied Weygandt\u2019s petition without an evidentiary hearing. Weygandt, represented by counsel, timely appealed only the dismissal of his claim of ineffective assistance of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b1608-23\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b1608-24\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"A7B-\">This court reviews the district court\u2019s denial of petitioner\u2019s writ of habeas corpus de novo. <em>Chatman v. Marquez, </em>754 F.2d 1531, 1533-34 (9th Cir.1985); <em>Roth v. United States Parole Commission, </em>724 F.2d 836, 839 (9th Cir.1984). This court also reviews de novo the district court\u2019s determination, based on the trial record in state court, that counsel rendered effective <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1493\">*1493</page-number>assistance. <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 2070, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984); <em>Butcher v. Marquez, </em>758 F.2d 373, 376 (9th Cir.1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b1609-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b1609-6\">INEFFECTIVE ASSISTANCE OF COUNSEL<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1609-7\">Weygandt contends that his counsel\u2019s failure to object to five allegedly prejudicial errors and counsel\u2019s failure to call additional witnesses amounted to a denial of Weygandt\u2019s Sixth Amendment right to effective assistance of counsel. To establish a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, the petitioner must show that his \u201c \u2018attorney\u2019s errors reflect a failure to exercise the skill, judgment, or diligence of a reasonably competent attorney,\u2019 and that [he] suffered prejudice as a result of those errors.\u201d <em>United States v. Vincent, </em>758 F.2d 379, 381 (9th Cir.1985) (quoting <em>United States v. Murray, </em>751 F.2d 1528, 1535 (9th Cir.1985)); <em>see Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. at \u2014 - \u2014, 104 S.Ct. at 2064-65 (1984); <em>United States v. Schaflander, </em>743 F.2d 714, 717-18 (9th Cir.1984), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 105 S.Ct. 1772, 84 L.Ed. 832 (1985). There is a strong presumption that counsel\u2019s performance fell within the wide range of reasonably effective assistance. <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at \u2014, 104 S.Ct. at 2066.</p>\n<p id=\"b1609-13\">Here, the only error Weygandt\u2019s counsel committed was in failing to object to the prosecutor\u2019s improper closing remarks. Weygandt failed to demonstrate, however, that he was actually prejudiced by this error. <em>See Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at \u2014, 104 S.Ct. at 2064; <em>Vincent, </em>758 F.2d at 381. A defendant is prejudiced if the court finds it is reasonably probable that, but for counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors, the result at trial would have been different. <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at \u2014, 104 S.Ct. at 2068; <em>Schaflander, </em>743 F.2d at 718. Although Weygandt\u2019s attorney should have objected to the prosecutor\u2019s improper remarks, his failure to do so, evaluated in light of the overwhelming evidence of guilt presented at trial, did not so prejudice Weygandt as to deprive him of a fair trial. The record shows that forty-two witnesses, including Weygandt, testified at trial. The jury heard eyewitness testimony and evidence of Weygandt\u2019s admission of guilt. Finally, the State submitted physical evidence corroborating Weygandt\u2019s disposal of Grimes\u2019s body. <em>See State v. Weygandt, </em>20 Wash.App. 599, 581 P.2d 1376 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b1609-18\">Thus, Weygandt\u2019s counsel\u2019s failure to object to the prosecutor\u2019s improper remarks in closing argument falls short of constitutional prejudice warranting habeas corpus relief when considered within the \u201ctotality of evidence.\u201d <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at \u2014, 104 S.Ct. at 2069. Accordingly, Weygandt <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1494\">*1494</page-number>failed to establish that his detention violates the Constitution. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254; <em>Townsend v. Sain, </em>372 U.S. 293, 312, 83 S.Ct. 745, 756, 9 L.Ed.2d 770 (1963); <em>Bashor v. Risley, </em>730 F.2d 1228, 1232 (9th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 105 S.Ct. 137, 83 L.Ed.2d 77 (1984). Therefore, Weygandt is not entitled to habeas corpus relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b1610-6\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b1610-7\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1610-8\">We affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal of Weygandt\u2019s petition for a writ of habeas corpus.</p>\n<p id=\"b1610-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1608-15\">. For a more detailed account of the murder, see <em>State v. Weygandt, </em>20 Wash.App. 599, 601-03, 581 P.2d 1376, 1377-78 (1978).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1608-16\">. The Washington Court of Appeals denied reconsideration of Weygandt\u2019s direct appeal and dismissed both Weygandt\u2019s personal restraint petitions. The Washington Supreme Court twice rejected Weygandt\u2019s applications for discretionary review.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1609-11\">. The State contends that <em>Wainwright v. Sykes, </em>433 U.S. 72, 87, 97 S.Ct. 2497, 2506, 53 L.Ed.2d 594 (1977), bars federal judicial review of Wey-gandt\u2019s habeas corpus petition because Wey-gandt failed to establish \"cause\u201d for his attorney\u2019s failure to object below. However, the <em>Wainwright </em>discussion is inapplicable here because Weygandt appeals only the district court\u2019s denial of habeas relief based on ineffective assistance of counsel. Weygandt is not seeking independent review of the alleged trial errors that are procedurally barred (lesser included instruction, <em>Bruton </em>violation, Fifth Amendment witness, burden-shifting instruction, and closing argument).</p>\n<p id=\"b1609-12\">Indeed, Weygandt's counsel noted in his brief that \u201d[w]hile each of the grounds independently might form the basis for relief, counsel is cognizant that this Court might find that insufficient steps were taken by trial counsel to preserve these errors for review independent of the right to counsel issue.\u201d Petitioner\u2019s Brief at 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b1609-21\">It is clear that Weygandt does not contend here that the five procedurally barred errors should be independently reviewable because ineffective assistance of counsel constitutes a \"cause\u201d exception to the <em>Wainwright </em>rule. Instead, the case involves a <em>separate </em>review of Weygandt\u2019s Sixth Amendment claim of ineffective assistance of <em>counsel. See Garrison v. McCarthy, </em>653 F.2d 374, 378 (9th Cir.1981) (counsel\u2019s inadvertence or ignorance not amounting to a Sixth Amendment violation may be sufficient cause under <em>Wainwright v. </em>Sykes). The Ninth Circuit addressed this issue directly in <em>Gibson v. Spalding, </em>665 F.2d 863 (9th Cir.1981). There, the Court held that when a petitioner claims ineffective assistance of counsel, the cause prong might be satisfied \"with proof short of that necessary to make out a Sixth Amendment claim.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 866, <em>citing Garrison v. McCarthy, </em>653 F.2d at 378.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
