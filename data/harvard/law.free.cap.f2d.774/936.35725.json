The district court granted the Government\u2019s motion for summary judgment and dismissed the plaintiffs\u2019 complaints, holding that the wages appellants had paid to their alien \u201ccommuter\u201d employees are not exempt from FICA taxes under 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 3121(b)(1) because that section exempts only agricultural workers admitted under the H-2 program. We affirm because the employees\u2019 status as \u201ccommuter\u201d aliens precludes their \u201cemployment\u201d from being exempted under section 3121(b)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b1058-20\">Plaintiff-appellant Don Moorhead (\u201cMoorhead\u201d) operated an agricultural harvesting business during the years 1977, 1978, and 1979, in which he employed hundreds of agricultural workers during the harvesting season to work in the Imperial Valley of California and elsewhere. Moor-head would contract with a grower to harvest a crop, usually lettuce crop, the grower paying a fixed rate per pound or crate of produce harvested. A majority of these workers were aliens,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> mostly Mexican citizens or residents of Mexico.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Each alien worker held a valid Alien Registration Receipt Card or \u201cgreen card,\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> permitting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"939\">*939</page-number>him to commute to the United States, daily or seasonally, from Mexico. During the harvesting season, Moorhead\u2019s foremen would transport Mexican workers from California border towns to the fields in the morning and return them to the border towns in the evening, when the workers would presumably return to their residences in Mexico.</p>\n<p id=\"b1059-5\">In the years 1977, 1978, and 1979, Moor-head withheld and collected FICA taxes from the alien workers and paid the employer and employee portions of the tax. Thereafter Moorhead filed a claim for refund of the employer portions of the tax he had paid for those three years. He claimed the workers were lawfully admitted to the United States on a temporary basis to perform agricultural services and, therefore, their wages were exempt from FICA taxation under the foreign-agricultural-worker exemption of 26 U.S.C. section 3121(b)(1). The IRS disallowed the claims and Moor-head filed this suit in the district court in November 1980, seeking, <em>inter alia, </em>a refund of the employer portion of FICA taxes paid during those years, approximately $100,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b1059-6\">During 1972, plaintiff-appellant Clifton Gattis (\u201cGattis\u201d) provided similar agricultural harvesting services in Arizona, New Mexico, and Michigan, employing hundreds of alien agricultural workers. Like Moorhead\u2019s employees, most of Gattis\u2019 workers were \u201cgreen card\u201d holders who resided in Mexico and commuted daily or seasonally to the United States. Unlike Moorhead, Gattis did not pay any FICA taxes on the wages he had paid to such alien workers in 1972. After an audit, the IRS determined FICA taxes were due, Gat-tis paid the tax, and he filed a claim for a refund. The basis for Gattis\u2019 initial failure to pay as well as the basis for his refund claim was the foreign-agricultural-worker exemption of section 3121(b)(1). The IRS disallowed the claim and in November 1981, Gattis filed this suit claiming damages in the amount of his claimed refund, approximately $11,500.</p>\n<p id=\"b1059-10\">The district court consolidated the two suits for discovery and pretrial motions. In February 1984, the district court granted the Government\u2019s summary judgment motion and dismissed appellants\u2019 complaints. In an unpublished memorandum decision, the district court held that only agricultural workers admitted under the H-2 program, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(15)(H)(ii), are admitted to the United States for the purpose of performing agricultural work on a temporary basis; since appellants\u2019 alien workers are not H-2 workers, the section 3121(b)(1)(B) exemption is inapplicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b1059-11\">Appellants bring this consolidated appeal claiming the district court erred in not holding that section 3121(b)(1) exempts from FICA taxes the. wages paid to their alien agricultural workers, who were lawfully admitted to the United States on a temporary basis as \u201ccommuter\u201d aliens.</p>\n<p id=\"AjQM\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b1059-12\">Both parties agree that there are no genuine issues of material fact to preclude the entry of summary judgment. <em>See, e.g., Prestin v. Mobil Oil Corp. </em>741 F.2d 268 (9th Cir.1984). In fact, before the Government had moved for summary judgment, the parties had entered into an extensive stipulation of facts, which was the foundation of the district court\u2019s findings of fact.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> A grant of summary judgment is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"940\">*940</page-number>reviewed de novo. <em>Lane v. Goren, </em>743 F.2d 1337 (9th Cir.1984); <em>Lojek v. Thomas, </em>716 F.2d 675, 677 (9th Cir.1983). Where, as here, there are no contested issues of fact, we need only decide whether the district court correctly applied the substantive law, <em>Lane </em>743 F.2d at 1339; <em>Amaro v. Continental Can Co., </em>724 F.2d 747, 749 (9th Cir.1984), that is, did the district court correctly interpret and apply the statutes in issue. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Roberts, </em>747 F.2d 537, 546 (9th Cir.1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b1060-4\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1060-5\">We begin with FICA and the particular language of section 3121(b)(1). FICA imposes on every employee, 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 3101, and employer, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 3111, a tax with respect to the \u201cwages\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> paid in \u201cemployment.\u201d <footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The employee\u2019s FICA tax is a fixed percentage of the wages he is paid, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 3101, and the employer portion is a fixed percentage of the wages he pays to each employee. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 3111. It is undisputed .that the remuneration appellants paid their alien workers during the years in question is \u201cwages,\u201d the dispute concerns whether the workers were engaged in \u201cemployment,\u201d as FICA defines that term.</p>\n<p id=\"b1060-6\">FICA excludes twenty enumerated categories of employment from its general definition of \u201cemployment\u201d One of the excluded categories is defined as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1060-7\">Service performed by foreign agricultural workers lawfully admitted to the United States ... from any other foreign country ... on a temporary basis to perform agricultural labor.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1060-16\">26 U.S.C. \u00a7 3121(b)(1). The Social Security Act of 1954 sets forth a parallel exclusion, which uses verbatim language to preclude temporary foreign agricultural workers from obtaining social security benefits.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1060-17\">The Government argues that the plain language of section 3121(b)(1) exempts the wages only of those agricultural workers: (1) lawfully admitted to the United States on a temporary basis; and (2) lawfully admitted to the United States for the purpose of performing agricultural labor. The Government concludes that since the status of an alien \u201ccommuter\u201d is that of a permanent resident, the exemption is inapplicable to appellants\u2019 workers. Only H-2 program workers are admitted to the United States on a temporary basis for the purpose of performing agricultural work, and, as a result, only H-2 workers can be exempt.</p>\n<p id=\"b1060-18\">Appellants argue that section 3121(b)(l)\u2019s temporariness requirement should not be defined by reference to immigration laws, but rather determined as a matter of fact on a case-by-case basis. They claim section 3121(b)(l)\u2019s legislative history \u201cclearly indicates\u201d that Congress intended to eliminate the migrant farm worker or \u201ccommuter\u201d segment of employees from FICA tax withholding and the corresponding benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b1060-19\">When interpreting a statute, the court\u2019s objective is to ascertain the intent of Congress and to give effect to legislative will. <em>E.g., Philbrook v. Glodgett, </em>421 U.S. 707, 713, 95 S.Ct. 1893, 1898, 44 L.Ed.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"941\">*941</page-number>525 (1975); <em>United States v. American Trucking Associations, </em>310 U.S. 534, 542, 60 S.Ct. 1059, 1063, 84 L.Ed. 1345 (1940); <em>Trailer Train Co. v. State Board of Equalization, </em>697 F.2d 860, 865 (9th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 104 S.Ct. 149, 78 L.Ed.2d 139 (1983). It is assumed that the legislative purpose is expressed by the ordinary meaning of the words used, <em>Richards v. United States, </em>369 U.S. 1, 9, 82 S.Ct. 585, 590, 7 L.Ed.2d 492 (1962); <em>Hughes Air Corp. v. Public Utilities Commission, </em>644 F.2d 1334,1337 (9th Cir.1981), and absent a clearly expressed legislative intention to the contrary, the language must ordinarily be regarded as conclusive. <em>American Tobacco Co. v. Patterson, </em>456 U.S. 63, 68, 102 S.Ct. 1534, 1537, 71 L.Ed.2d 748 (1982); <em>Consumer Products Safety Commission v. GTE Sylvania, Inc., </em>447 U.S. 102, 108, 100 S.Ct. 2051, 2056, 64 L.Ed.2d 766 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b1061-8\">We read the language of the statute according to its plain meaning and agree with the Government\u2019s construction of section 3121(b)(1); i.e., that the statute imposes two requirements. The foreign agricultural worker must be: (1) lawfully admitted to the United States on a temporary basis (temporariness requirement); and (2) lawfully admitted to the United States ... to perform agricultural labor (purpose-of-admission requirement). <em>See </em>26 U.S.C. \u00a7 3121(b)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b1061-9\">Another canon of statutory construction, while not a controlling consideration, supports this construction of section 3121(b)(1). Grants of tax exemptions are narrowly construed against the assertions of the taxpayers and in favor of the taxing power. <em>E.g., Bingler v. Johnson, </em>394 U.S. 741, 752-53, 89 S.Ct. 1439, 1445-46, 22 L.Ed.2d 695 (1969); <em>Commissioner v. Jacobson, </em>336 U.S. 28, 48-49, 69 S.Ct. 358, 368-69, 93 L.Ed. 477 (1949); <em>Atlantic Coast Line Railroad v. Phillips, </em>332 U.S. 168, 172, 67 S.Ct. 1584, 1586, 91 L.Ed. 1977 (1947); <em>Helvering v. Northwest Steel Rolling Mills, Inc., </em>311 U.S. 46, 49, 61 S.Ct. 109, 111, 85 L.Ed. 29 (1940); 3C. <em>Sands, Sutherland Statutory Construction </em>\u00a7 66.-09, at 207 (1974). This canon seeks to tax income comprehensively, <em>Commissioner v. Jacobson, </em>336 U.S. at 49, 69 S.Ct. at 369, and to minimize differential treatment and foster impartiality, fairness and equality of treatment among taxpayers.</p>\n<p id=\"b1061-11\">Turning to the temporariness requirement of section 3121(b)(1), we reject appellants\u2019 argument that \u201con a temporary basis\u201d should be decided on a case-by-case basis. Appellants ask the court to examine the facts of this case and fashion a test to determine whether appellants\u2019 workers were working in the United States \u201con a temporary basis.\u201d A common law approach is unnecessary, however, because Congress has spoken.</p>\n<p id=\"b1061-12\">A statute is passed in whole and not piecemeal. Thus,' in interpreting a statute, examination of the whole, not isolated words, will disclose legislative intent. <em>See Stanford v. Commissioner, </em>297 F.2d 298 (9th Cir.1961). When viewed in context, section 3121(b)(1) exempts foreign agricultural workers lawfully admitted to the United States on a temporary basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b1061-13\">Nothing in FICA or the Social Security Act defines which aliens are lawfully admitted to the United States on a temporary basis. However, the Immigration and Nationality Act (\u201cINA\u201d), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1101-1503, establishes a comprehensive scheme for aliens\u2019 exclusion from and admission to the United States. One looks to the INA and immigration regulations to ascertain the prerequisites of lawful admission and the term and conditions of an alien\u2019s lawful presence in the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b1061-14\">In the absence of a definition in FICA, we find that when Congress wrote \u201clawfully admitted\u201d to the United States it intended to incorporate the INA and concomitant body of regulations and administrative practice to define that term.</p>\n<p id=\"b1061-15\">The INA establishes a status for aliens seeking admission to the United States, which status dictates the admissibility of an alien. The immigration status of appellants\u2019 alien workers is determinative of whether the workers are \u201clawfully admit<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"942\">*942</page-number>ted\u201d to the United States on a temporary basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b1062-4\">The IN A distinguishes two categories of aliens: nonimmigrants and immigrants. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(15). Section 1101(a)(15) supplies a negative definition of immigrant: \u201cThe term \u2018immigrant\u2019 means every alien except an alien who is within one of the following classes of nonimmigrant aliens\u2014 [listing 15 nonimmigrant categories].\u201d An alien who fits in one of the 15 exclusionary categories in section 1101(a)(15) is a nonim-migrant. The number of immigrants admitted to the United States is restricted by immigrant quotas. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1181(a); <em>Saxbe v. Bustos, </em>419 U.S. 65, 66-67, 95 S.Ct. 272, 275, 42 L.Ed.2d 231 (1974). However, a nonimmigrant is permitted admission to the United States irrespective of such quota limitations. <em>See id. </em>at 67, 95 S.Ct. at 275.</p>\n<p id=\"b1062-5\">One category of nonimmigrant, the H-2 worker, is \u201can alien having a residence in a foreign country which he has no intention of abandoning ... who is coming temporarily to the United States to perform temporary services or labor, if unemployed persons capable of performing such service or labor cannot be found in this country____\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(15)(H)(ii).</p>\n<p id=\"b1062-8\">Appellants\u2019 workers are not H-2 workers because they cannot show that \u201cunemployed persons capable of performing such service or labor cannot be found in this country.\u201d <em>See Gooch v. Clark, </em>433 F.2d 74, 78 (9th Cir.1970), <em>quoting </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(15)(H)(ii), <em>cert. denied, </em>402 U.S. 995, 91 S.Ct. 2170, 29 L.Ed.2d 160 (1971); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 214.2 (1985). Appellants\u2019 workers are not H-2 workers and do not fit within any of the other exclusionary categories of section 1101(a)(15). Consequently, they are deemed immigrants under section 1101(a)(15). <em>See Gooch, </em>433 F.2d at 78.</p>\n<p id=\"b1062-9\">Generally, an immigrant will not be admitted into the United States without a valid unexpired immigration visa and a passport. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1181(a). However, \u201creturning resident immigrants, defined in section 1101(a)(27)(A) ... who are otherwise admissible may be readmitted to the United States by the Attorney General in his discretion without being required to obtain a passport, immigrant visa, reentry permit or other documentation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1181(b). A resident immigrant or \u201cspecial immigrant\u201d is defined as: \u201can immigrant, lawfully admitted for permanent residence, who is returning from \u00e1 temporary visit abroad.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1101(a)(27)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b1062-11\">In <em>Gooch, </em>402 U.S. 995, 91 S.Ct. 2170, 29 L.Ed.2d 160 (1971), we upheld the INS\u2019s longstanding practice of classifying \u201ccommuters\u201d as section 1101(a)(27)(B) \u201cspecial immigrants,\u201d 433 F.2d at 78, permitting the Attorney General to admit \u201ccommuters\u201d under the informal documentation requirements of section 1181(b), and exempting \u201ccommuters\u201d from the quota limitations applicable to immigrants and the labor certification requirements applicable to H-2 workers.</p>\n<p id=\"b1062-12\">The Supreme Court adopted much of <em>Gooch\u2019s </em>reasoning in <em>Saxbe v. Bustos, </em>419 U.S. 65, 95 S.Ct. 272, 42 L.Ed.2d 231 (1974). In <em>Saxbe </em>the United Farm Workers Committee brought suit challenging the INS\u2019s practice of allowing aliens to commute to places of employment in the United States on a daily or seasonal basis as \u201cspecial immigrants.\u201d The Court upheld the INS\u2019s practice and reasoned that because \u201ccommuters\u201d do not fall within any of the non-immigrant categories of section 1101(a)(15), they are immigrants. <em>Id. </em>at 71, 95 S.Ct. at 277. A \u201cspecial immigrant\u201d is \u201can immigrant, lawfully admitted for permanent residence, who is returning from a temporary visit abroad.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(27)(B). Section 1101(a)(20) defines \u201clawfully admitted for permanent residence,\u201d as \u201cthe status of having been lawfully accorded the privilege of residing permanently in the United States as an immigrant in accordance with the immigration laws, such status not having changed.\u201d This section 1101(a)(20) status is acquired when \u201can alien satisfies (1) any numerical limitations on the entry of immigrants, (2) requirements as to qualitative matters such as health, morals, and economic status, and (3) the need for an immigrant visa. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"943\">*943</page-number>applicant must also state whether he plans to remain in the United States permanently.\u201d <em>Saxbe, </em>419 U.S. at 72, 95 S.Ct. at 277 (footnotes omitted). The INA does not state that the status will be denied him if he does not intend to reside permanently in the United States. <em>Id. </em>\u201c[T]he status acquired carries several important privileges: [the commuter] may remain in the United States indefinitely; he is free to work in this country; he may return to this country after a temporary absence abroad; and he has the privilege of establishing a permanent residence in the United States.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Relying on the reasoning of <em>Gooch, </em>the Court found that a \u201ccommuter\u2019s\u201d nightly or seasonal departure from the United States to his foreign residence is a \u201ctemporary visit abroad\u201d from which he returns when he reenters the United States for employment. <em>Id. </em>Finally, in concluding that \u201ccommuters\u201d are \u201cspecial immigrants\u201d admittable irrespective of quotas or labor certification, the court placed great weight upon the INS\u2019s longstanding construction of the statute and practice of treating \u201ccommuters\u201d as \u201cspecial immigrants,\u201d which longstanding practice had been acquiesced in by Congress. <em>Id. </em>at 73-80, 95 S.Ct. at 278-281.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1063-4\">This Court again faced the \u201ccommuter\u201d issue in <em>Alvarez v. District Director of INS, </em>539 F.2d 1220 (9th Cir.1976), <em>cert. denied, </em>430 U.S. 918, 97 S.Ct. 1334, 51 L.Ed.2d 597 (1977). The plaintiff, a native of the Philippines, entered the United States as a permanent resident in 1968 and returned to the Philippines in 1970 where she worked as a pharmacist.. Between 1970 and 1973, she made several brief trips to the United States to visit friends, gaining admission to this country with a \u201cgreen card.\u201d In upholding an immigration judge\u2019s order of deportation, we held the plaintiff did not fall within the \u201ccommuter\u201d category because: she did not come to the United States to work; she did not commute daily or seasonally; and her home is not m a country contiguous to the United States. <em>Id. </em>at 1224.</p>\n<p id=\"b1063-7\">Under <em>Gooch, Saxbe, </em>and <em>Alvarez, </em>appellants\u2019 alien workers may have entered the United States to perform agricultural work; however, their status as \u201ccommuters\u201d precludes us from finding they were lawfully admitted to the United States on a temporary basis. To have become a \u201ccommuter,\u201d each of appellants\u2019 workers must have acquired the status referred to in section 1101(a)(20), <em>viz., </em>\u201cthe status of having been lawfully accorded the privilege of residing permanently in the United States.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(20); <em>see also Saxbe </em>419 U.S. at 71-72, 95 S.Ct. at 277. Their \u201ccommuter\u201d status permitted them to take up permanent residence in the United States at the conclusion of their work for appellants; their status permitted them to leave the United States at the conclusion of their work for appellants and, subject to certain limitations, return to the United States sometime thereafter; and their status permitted them, at the conclusion of their work for appellants, to engage in nonagri-cultural work in the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b1063-8\">Appellants\u2019 workers also do not satisfy the purpose-of-admission requirement of section 3121(b)(1)(B). Appellants\u2019 workers were not admitted to the United States solely for the purpose of performing agricultural labor. As \u201ccommuters\u201d they were admitted to the United States with no limitation on their lawful activity. When they entered the United States they could have worked in whatever occupation they chose, without regard to any labor certification restrictions. A \u201ccommuter\u2019s\u201d status is different from that of H-2 workers. <em>See Saxbe, </em>419 U.S. at 69-70, 95 S.Ct. at 276. An H-2 worker is a nonimmigrant, an alien \u201chaving a residence in a foreign country which he has no intention of abandoning who is coming temporarily to the United States to perform temporary services or labor, if unemployed persons capable of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"944\">*944</page-number>performing such service or labor cannot be found in this country.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(15)(H)(ii). An H-2 worker must be coming to the United States only for a temporary period; the employer\u2019s need for the alien workers skill or job duties must be temporary; and in most cases H-2 status requires a certification from the Department of Labor that qualified persons in the United States are not available and that the employment of the alien will not adversely affect the wages and working conditions of similarly employed workers in the United States. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(15)(H)(ii); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 214.2(h)(3)(i) (1985); 3 <em>Immigration Law Report </em>1-3 (January 1984). While appellants \u2018 \u201ccommuter\u201d workers do not satisfy the purpose-of-admission requirement of section 3121(b)(1)(B), H-2 agricultural workers could, in instances where the workers are admitted specially to perform agricultural labor.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1064-4\">Appellants argue that section 3121(b)(l)\u2019s legislative history clearly indicates that Congress intended to eliminate the migrant farm worker or commuter segment of employees from FICA.</p>\n<p id=\"b1064-5\">This Court has said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1064-6\">[I]f evidence drawn from the face of the statute militates strongly for one interpretation, but not quite so strongly that the legislative history may safely be ignored, the legislative history should be considered but considered, cautiously. Under these circumstances a second interpretation should be accepted on the basis of the legislative history only if the evidence is very strong, which will usually require explicit language.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1064-9\"><em>Heppner v.

Not an iota of this history links the \u201cgreen card\u201d commuter with the section 3121(b)(1) exemption. None of this history is antithetical to our conclusion that the status of commuters, possessing the privilege to remain and work in the United States, precludes them from the section 3121(b)(1) exemption. Thus, we do not find \u201cvery strong\u201d evidence or \u201cexplicit language\u201d in the legislative history that Congress intended to exempt appellants and their employees from the payment of FICA taxes under section 3121(b)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b1064-12\">In conclusion, we find that the appellants\u2019 employees status as \u201ccommuters,\u201d enjoying the privilege to establish permanent residence in the United States, precludes their \u201cemployment\u201d from being exempted under section 3121(b)(1).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"alm-dedup-0\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1058-12\">.
