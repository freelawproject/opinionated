Michigan Mutual, the workers\u2019 compensation insurer of certain Union members, claimed that it had stated a common law tort action under Michigan law against the Union. Michigan Mutual alleged that the Union breached its duty, arising under a collective bargaining agreement, to provide safety services to its members. Relying on <em>Condon v. United Steelworkers of America, </em>683 F.2d 590 (1st Cir.1982) the district court ruled that federal labor law had preempted a state negligence claim arising out of the Union\u2019s collective bargaining agreement with management. Therefore, on the Union\u2019s motion, the district court dismissed Michigan Mutual\u2019s complaint for failure to state a cause of action. We affirm. In <em>Allis-Chalmers Corp. v. Lueck, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 105 S.Ct. 1904, 85 L.Ed.2d 206 (1985), the Supreme Court confirmed that federal labor law has preempted claims such as that brought by Michigan Mutual in the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-22\">David Singleton and Ralph Lucas were members of the Union and employees of McLouth Steel Corporation (McLouth). During the day of August 31, 1971, Singleton and Lucas allegedly occupied an improvised shanty on the premises of the McLouth plant where they worked. While attempting to leave the shanty during what is described as a \u201cfull runner,\u201d Singleton and Lucas were severely burned and injured. Singleton died from the resulting injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-23\">Singleton\u2019s estate and Lucas filed suits in Wayne County Circuit Court against Michigan Mutual as workers\u2019 compensation insurer for McLouth. They sought dam<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>ages from Michigan Mutual for Singleton\u2019s wrongful death and Lucas\u2019 injuries. Shortly after a jury returned verdicts in favor of Singleton\u2019s estate and Lucas, Michigan Mutual agreed to a settlement under which it would pay a total of $1,500,-000 in damages. The Union was not a party to either the suits or the settlement agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-5\">On May 19, 1982, Michigan Mutual initiated this action against the Union in state court for contribution toward the settlement amount. Michigan Mutual alleged that the Union was responsible for the injuries to Singleton and Lucas because it had failed, as exclusive bargaining representative for McLouth employees, to require McLouth to remove the shanty, allegedly a known hazardous condition, from the plant. The Union removed the case to federal court, where Michigan Mutual\u2019s amended complaint advanced two independent counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-6\">Count One of Michigan Mutual\u2019s amended complaint invoked Michigan tort law. The complaint raised the following allegations: that the Union had agreed by virtue of its collective bargaining agreement with McLouth to perform safety services for its members; that Michigan law imposed a duty to exercise reasonable care in performing these services; that the Union breached this duty by its simple negligence; and that the Union\u2019s negligence proximately caused the injuries to Singleton and Lucas. The district court concluded that federal labor law has preempted state law actions based upon a duty which a union owes its members under a collective bargaining agreement, and, therefore, dismissed this count. Michigan Mutual subsequently voluntarily dismissed Count Two with prejudice. That count alleged that the Union had breached its duty under \u00a7 301 of the Labor Management Relations Act (LMRA) to fairly represent its members. Count Two is not at issue on this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-7\">Michigan Mutual claims that it has stated a cause of action under Michigan law for the Union\u2019s negligent performance of duties it voluntarily assumed under the collective bargaining agreement with McLouth. As the basis for the existence of a duty of reasonable care in the execution of voluntarily assumed duties, the company cites 2 <em>Restatement of Torts, </em>2d, \u00a7 324A, and numerous cases in which the Michigan courts have followed the Restatement. This duty of reasonableness allegedly exists independent from and alongside a Union\u2019s duty of fair representation, which is breached only by arbitrary, discriminatory, or bad faith conduct. <em>See Vaca v. Sipes, </em>386 U.S. 171, 87 S.Ct. 903, 17 L.Ed.2d 842 (1967); <em>Ruzicka v. General Motors Corp., </em>649 F.2d 1207 (6th Cir.1981). In support of the proposition that the Union owes a duty of reasonable care Michigan Mutual relies upon three authorities: <em>Bryant v. United Mineworkers, </em>467 F.2d 1 (6th Cir.1972), <em>cert. denied, </em>410 U.S. 930, 93 S.Ct. 1370, 35 L.Ed.2d 592 (1973); <em>Helton v. Hake, </em>386 F.Supp. 1027 (W.D.Mo.1974); <em>Dunbar v. United Steelworkers of America, </em>100 Idaho 523, 602 P.2d 21 (1979), <em>cert. denied, </em>446 U.S. 983, 100 S.Ct. 2963, 64 L.Ed.2d 839 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b225-9\">The force of Michigan Mutual\u2019s contentions was dubious in light of the holding in <em>Condon v. United Steelworkers of America, </em>683 F.2d 590 (1st Cir.1982), upon which the district court relied. Those contentions have been definitively foreclosed by the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Allis-Chalmers Corp. v. Lueck, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 105 S.Ct. 1904, 85 L.Ed.2d 206 (1985). Justice Blackmun, writing on behalf of a unanimous Court, established in <em>Allis Chalmers </em>that obligations or duti\u00e9s created by a collective bargaining agreement are enforceable only under federal law.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b225-12\">[Wjhen resolution of a state-law claim is substantially dependent upon analysis of the terms of an agreement made between parties in a labor contract, that claim must either be treated as a \u00a7 301 claim, see <em>Avco Corp. v. Aero Lodge No. 735, </em>390 U.S. 557, 88 S.Ct. 1235, 20 L.Ed.2d 126 (1968), or dismissed as preempted by federal labor-contract law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A5p\">105 S.Ct. at 1916.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-13\">In <em>Allis-Chalmers </em>the Court considered a suit by a union member against his employer and the insurance company which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>administered a disability insurance plan created under a collective bargaining agreement. The plaintiff sued under Wisconsin tort law for bad-faith handling of his disability claims. In determining that the LMRA preempted this state tort action, the Court looked to <em>Teamsters v. Lucas Flour Co., </em>369 U.S. 95, 82 S.Ct. 571, 7 L.Ed.2d 593 (1962), for \u201cthe policies that animate \u00a7 301.\u201d <em>Allis-Chalmers, </em>105 S.Ct. at 1911. Unless a uniform body of federal law governed the interpretation of collective bargaining agreements, it would be difficult both to negotiate agreements and to settle disputes because of \u201c \u2018the possibility of conflicting substantive interpretation under competing legal systems.\u2019 \u201d <em>Allis-Chalmers, </em>105 S.Ct. at 1910-11 (quoting <em>Lucas Flour, </em>369 U.S. at 103-04, 82 S.Ct. at 576-77). The Supreme Court, thus refused to \u201celevate form over substance,\u201d <em>id., </em>by limiting the rationale of <em>Lucas Flour </em>to suits for breach of contract and distinguishing suits for tort.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-4\">The holding of <em>Allis-Chalmers </em>is not without limits. Section 301 does not preempt all state regulation of the substantive provisions of collective bargaining agreements. <em>Allis-Chalmers </em>105 S.Ct. at 1911, n. 6. Nor does \u00a7 301 necessarily preempt lawsuits that assert rights created independent of collective-bargaining agreements, but related to them in some way. <em>Allis-Chalmers </em>105 S.Ct. at 1916.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-5\">The relevant question under <em>Allis-Chal-mers </em>is whether a determination of the existence and scope of the duty which the defendant allegedly breached is \u201csubstantially dependent\u201d upon analysis of the terms of a collective bargaining agreement. <em>Allis-Chalmers, </em>105 S.Ct. at 1916. Count One of Michigan Mutual\u2019s amended complaint alleges that the collective bargaining agreement is the origin of the Union\u2019s duty to provide safety services to its employees.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AXU\">5. By virtue of an agreement entered into between McLouth Steel Corporation and the Union, dated September 30, 1968, ... the Union and the Local Union agreed or intended to provide safety services for the benefit of McLouth Steel, its employees or the union membership including David Singleton and Ralph Lucas.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b226-7\">The district court properly dismissed this count as preempted by \u00a7 301 of the LMRA. As Michigan Mutual has voluntarily dismissed with prejudice its allegation in Count Two that the Union violated its duty of fair representation, the district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
