Qualls both of forcibly breaking into a United States Post Office with intent to commit larceny and of theft or receipt of stolen mail. The district court sentenced Qualls to two years in custody and three years on probation. Defendant did not appeal the convictions. In 1981, the petition<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"851\">*851</page-number>er\u2019s probation was revoked. In July 1982, Qualls petitioned the district court, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 (1982), to vacate, set aside or correct his sentence due to ineffective assistance of counsel. To support his claim, petitioner submitted an affidavit charging that trial counsel had: 1) failed to file a notice of appeal; 2) failed to investigate properly petitioner\u2019s case; 3) failed to raise the issue of defendant\u2019s lack of capacity to form the requisite specific intent; and 4) failed to return petitioner\u2019s phone calls. In response, trial counsel filed an affidavit substantially contradicting petitioner\u2019s contentions. Counsel claimed that petitioner had agreed not to pursue an appeal, fearing a stiffer sentence on retrial. Counsel contended that Qualls had received a \u201csatisfactory\u201d sentence largely because the court considered him to be a first-time offender. His status as a first-time offender, however, would be in jeopardy on retrial due to state criminal charges then pending against Qualls. Defense counsel alleged that both he and Qualls feared a stiffer sentence on retrial if the sentencing judge had the benefit of the state criminal conviction in resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b971-5\">The district court dismissed petitioner\u2019s section 2255 motion, crediting counsel\u2019s affidavit over petitioner\u2019s, and denying petitioner\u2019s requests for counsel and for an evidentiary hearing. On appeal, this Court reversed since the district court credited counsel\u2019s affidavit over petitioner\u2019s without the benefit of an evidentiary hearing. We remanded for an evidentiary hearing to determine whether petitioner chose to forego his right to appeal. <em>United States v. Qualls, </em>729 F.2d 1464 (7th Cir.1984) (unpublished order).</p>\n<p id=\"b971-6\">After holding an evidentiary hearing, the district court found the defense attorney\u2019s version of the facts was more credible, and that the decision to forego appeal had been strategic. Hence, the district court again dismissed petitioner\u2019s section 2255 motion. Petitioner appeals from this dismissal maintaining that: 1) the district court did not conduct a full evidentiary hearing in accordance with our mandate, and 2) even if counsel\u2019s version of the facts is accepted, Quail\u2019s decision to forego appeal was based on his attorney\u2019s inadequate investigation of the pending state charges. For the reasons stated below, we affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal of petitioner\u2019s section 2255 motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b971-8\">As to defendant\u2019s first contention, we refer to our previous order, which remanded the cause for an evidentiary hearing. There, we noted that, \u201c[i]f ... petitioner deliberately chose not to appeal, the deliberation is at an end and the district court should deny petitioner\u2019s section 2255 motion at the outset.\u201d <em>United States v. Qualls, </em>729 F.2d 1464 at 2. Thus, we did not require a \u201cfull\u201d evidentiary hearing on the merits, but only a hearing to determine whether \u201cpetitioner deliberately chose not to appeal.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We find no merit in defendant\u2019s contention that our mandate required the judge to hold an evidentiary hearing on the merits of petitioner\u2019s allegations of ineffective assistance of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b971-9\">Our decision was based on the principle that section 2255 is not a substitute for direct appeal. <em>United States v. Addonizio, </em>442 U.S. 178, 184, 99 S.Ct. 2235, 2239, 60 L.Ed.2d 805 (1979). If any issue could have been raised on direct appeal, the failure to take such appeal precludes review pursuant to a section 2255 motion unless the petitioner can show \u201ccause\u201d for the procedural default and \u201cactual prejudice\u201d resulting from the errors of which the petitioner complains. <em>United States v. Frady, </em>456 U.S. 152, 167, 102 S.Ct. 1584, 1594, 71 L.Ed.2d 816 (1982). Although it could be argued that some of the petitioner\u2019s claims could not have been raised on direct appeal, and thus that his failure to take such an appeal should not preclude our review here, petitioner does not raise this issue on appeal. More importantly, petitioner did not raise this issue before the district court in either petition for section 2255 relief. Accordingly, defendant has waived the issue for appeal. <em>See United States ex rel. Cole v. Lane, </em>752 F.2d 1210, 1219 (7th Cir.1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b971-10\">Petitioner next contends that his decision to forego appeal was due to ineffective <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"852\">*852</page-number>assistance of counsel in failing adequately to investigate the likelihood of conviction on the pending state charges. Hence, petitioner seeks to show \u201ccause\u201d for his procedural default by demonstrating ineffective assistance of counsel in the determination of whether to file a notice of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b972-4\">To establish constitutionally defective assistance of counsel petitioner must show that trial counsel\u2019s \u201cconduct so undermined the proper functioning of the adversarial process that the trial cannot be relied on as having produced a just result.\u201d <em>Strickland v. </em>Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 2064, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984). This standard requires the petitioner to demonstrate that counsel\u2019s performance was deficient and that \u201cthe deficient performance prejudiced the defense.\u201d <em>Id.</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b972-5\">In essence, petitioner seeks to show deficient performance by alleging that counsel should not have based his decision not to appeal solely on petitioner\u2019s belief that he was likely to be convicted on the state charges. Although it is questionable whether trial counsel\u2019s actions could be construed as constitutionally defective, we need not reach this issue since we find that petitioner has failed to establish prejudice in taking counsel\u2019s advice to forego appeal. Petitioner has not urged that the pending state charges did not, in fact, result in conviction, nor that the consideration of these convictions would not have resulted in an enhanced sentence on retrial. Hence, petitioner cannot demonstrate prejudice resulting from the allegedly \u201cdeficient\u201d advice to forego direct appeal. We therefore are unable to find that petitioner received ineffective assistance of counsel in determining whether to pursue a direct appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b972-6\">In sum, we find no error in the district court\u2019s dismissal of petitioner\u2019s section 2255 motion. The judgment of the district court is accordingly</p>\n<p id=\"b972-7\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b972-8\">. Our decision in <em>Clay v. Director, </em>749 F.2d 427 (7th Cir.1984), indicates that a lower standard may apply if the failure to appeal was negligent as opposed to strategic. Since the decision to forego appeal was deemed strategic, the <em>Strickland </em>standard applies.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
