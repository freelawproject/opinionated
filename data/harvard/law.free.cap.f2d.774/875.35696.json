(Barclays), as successor in interest to Aetna Business Credit, Inc., loaned substantial sums of money to A &amp; C Johnson Co. (A &amp; C). The loans were calculated as a percentage of inventory, which ranged from $1.3 to $1.7 million, and were secured by A &amp; C\u2019s accounts receivable. Proceeds from the accounts were to be deposited in a special \u201ccollateral\u201d account maintained by A &amp; C. Long, president and majority stockholder in A &amp; C, was also guarantor on the loans. A &amp; C and Long both filed for bankruptcy and Barclays now seeks to prevent discharge of debts resulting from Long\u2019s guaranty by alleging (1) misconduct in obtaining some $90,000 worth of additional loans by inflating inventory valuation and (2) misconduct in diverting $139,120.97 worth of collateral (i.e. accounts receivable proceeds) to a new corporate account. Long used the diverted proceeds for attorneys\u2019 fees and other expenditures to keep A &amp; C functioning as an active business, an effort which quickly failed when Barclays refused further credit while A &amp; C was in Chapter 11 reorganization.</p>\n<p id=\"b996-20\">The case was heard by Bankruptcy Judge Kenneth G. Owens, who died prior to rendering an opinion. By consent of the parties, Bankruptcy Judge Robert J. Kres-sel decided the case on the written record, and allowed discharge of the debt in a reported opinion. <em>In Re Long, </em>44 B.R. 300 (Bkrtcy.D.Minn.1983). On review in the district court, Judge Diana E. Murphy affirmed in an unreported opinion. We also affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b997-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"877\">*877</page-number>I. ALLEGATIONS OF FRAUDULENT BORROWING</p>\n<p id=\"b997-5\">Barclays contends that A &amp; C obtained excessive loans by misrepresenting the value of its inventory. The allegation concerns the financial condition of A &amp; C and is thus governed by 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 523(a)(2)(B).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b997-6\">Barclays contends that it relied on representations that A &amp; C\u2019s inventory was valued at \u201ccost or market, whichever is less.\u201d These representations appeared in a footnote to a 1979 financial statement and also in monthly certifications supplied by A &amp; C. There was testimony, however, that it was A &amp; C\u2019s practice to establish a cost for an inventory, item when the item was originally purchased. If additional quantities of the item were purchased later, the new quantities were entered into the computer records but the per item cost of the original purchases became the assigned or constructive cost of the new purchases. Assuming that this method of record keeping was actually used, as the bankruptcy judge found, there was an inherently inflationary effect on the valuation of inventory on any occasions when items were purchased at discounted prices. Thus, when A &amp; C purchased 30,000 rolls of wallpaper at a discount of some 90%, its assigned cost was the supplier\u2019s full list price of $5.50 per roll, the price at which A &amp; C had previously purchased 15-17,000 rolls of the same item.</p>\n<p id=\"b997-7\">Although the parties discuss the issue as though it involved an erroneous use of market valuation, that does not seem to be the case. Barclays essentially contends that A &amp; C was representing that its inventory was carried at <em>actual </em>cost for each item, and that the use of a constructive cost, based on the list price of the same type of merchandise, was a fraudulent misrepresentation.</p>\n<p id=\"b997-10\">Apart from the accounting issues raised, there is no showing that the inventory as a whole was overvalued for going-concern purposes. On the other hand, large portions of the inventory (including that carried at actual list-price cost) seem to have been overvalued for liquidation sale purposes. Barclays asserts a total loss of approximately $550,000, and other creditors have also suffered major losses.</p>\n<p id=\"b997-11\">Discharge is barred under \u00a7 523(a)(2)(B) only if, inter alia, the debtor acted with an \u201cintent to deceive.\u201d 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 523(a)(2)(B)(iv). The bankruptcy judge, as well as the district judge, found that Barclays failed to prove Long acted with the requisite intent. 44 B.R. at 310. Despite Barclays\u2019 request for what amounts to de novo review, the lower courts\u2019 findings, even though not based on observation of witnesses, are binding upon this court unless clearly erroneous. <em>Anderson v. Bessemer City, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 105 S.Ct. 1504, 1511-12, 84 L.Ed.2d 518 (1985). <em>See also In re Hunter, </em>771 F.2d 1126 (8th Cir.1985) (reaffirming the clearly erroneous standard of review for bankruptcy judge decisions). Recognizing that the factual inferences are debatable,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Barclays <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"878\">*878</page-number>does not convince us that the findings below are clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b998-4\">Barclays also argues that the bankruptcy judge should have been reversed because he relied excessively on the noninvolvement of Long personally in the corporate record-keeping or in the monthly certifications. A subsequent decision of this court establishes a rule of responsibility for fraud perpetrated by the debtor\u2019s agent if the debtor knew or should have known of the fraud. <em>In re Walker, </em>726 F.2d 452 (8th Cir.1984). Judge Murphy did consider the effect of the <em>Walker </em>case, and concluded that the bankruptcy judge\u2019s findings sufficiently established that Long neither knew of nor should have known of fraud. We agree. <em>Walker, </em>unlike this case, involved the debt- or\u2019s unincorporated business. His wife was clearly acting as his personal agent, while it is not at all clear that A &amp; C employees were personal agents of Long. Moreover, Judge Kressel found no fraudulent conduct by any of A &amp; C\u2019s employees, and Barclays does not identify any employee whose personal misconduct allegedly exceeds that of Long. Absent such a contention, there is nothing to reevaluate in light of <em>Walker. </em>Long\u2019s discharge from the debt to Barclays is not barred by fraud in borrowing.</p>\n<p id=\"b998-5\">II. ALLEGATIONS OF DEFALCATION BY A FIDUCIARY</p>\n<p id=\"b998-6\">Barclays contends that the channeling of income from a segregated \u201ccollateral\u201d account to a corporate bank account, and the subsequent distribution, constitutes defalcation or fraud by a fiduciary, and therefore bars discharge of Long\u2019s debts pursuant to 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 523(a)(4). The contention is founded on a document to which Barclays and A &amp; C were parties, and in which A &amp; C agreed to become trustee of an \u201cexpress trust.\u201d The corpus of the trust was to consist of moneys obtained from accounts receivable, which were to be placed in a segregated bank account, payable to Barclays.</p>\n<p id=\"b998-10\">It has long been established that the Bankruptcy Act reference to \u201cfiduciaries\u201d applies only to trustees of express trusts. <em>Davis v. Aetna Acceptance Co., </em>293 U.S. 328, 333, 55 S.Ct. 151, 153, 79 L.Ed. 393 (1934). Long, however, was not an express fiduciary because the document purportedly creating the trust named A &amp; C, rather than Long, as trustee. <em>See In re Levitan, </em>46 B.R. 380, 386-87 (Bkrtcy.E.D.N.Y.1985). The Code does not reach constructive trustees, designated as such because of misconduct. We recognize that there are cases charging individuals, by virtue of their corporate officer status, with the corporation\u2019s fiduciary duties. <em>In re Interstate Agency, Inc., </em>760 F.2d 121, 124-25 (6th Cir.1985); <em>Matter of Whitlock, </em>449 F.Supp. 1383, 1390 (W.D.Mo.1978). To the extent these cases hold that a statute or other state law rule may create fiduciary status in an officer which is cognizable in bankruptcy proceedings, we agree.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We question, however, the propriety of imposing a corporation\u2019s fiduciary duties on a stockholder-employee in the absence of such a local rule, and decline to do so outside the special contexts in which the doctrine arose.</p>\n<p id=\"b998-11\">Moreover, even if Long personally had been named as trustee, or if we chose to impose the corporation\u2019s fiduciary duties on him by virtue of his officer status, we hold that he was not a trustee in the \u201cstrict and narrow sense,\u201d as required to bar discharge under \u00a7 523(a)(4). <em>See Davis, </em>293 U.S. at 333, 55 S.Ct. at 153. It is the substance of a transaction, rather than the labels assigned by the parties, which determines whether there is a fiduciary relation<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"879\">*879</page-number>ship for bankruptcy purposes. <em>Davis, </em>293 U.S. at 334, 55 S.Ct. at 154. Under this analysis, many cases have held that the type of relationship which existed between A &amp; C and Barclays is intrinsically more contractual than fiduciary. <em>Davis, </em>293 U.S. at 334, 55 S.Ct. at 154. <em>In re Levitan, </em>46 B.R. 380, 385 (Bkrtcy.E.D.N.Y.1985); <em>In re Gallaudet, </em>46 B.R. 918, 925 (Bkrtcy.D.Vt.1985); <em>In re Miles, </em>5 B.R. 458, 460 (Bkrtcy.E.D.Va.1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b999-5\">We therefore agree with the courts below that Barclays cannot soundly invoke the fiduciary bar against discharge of Long\u2019s obligation.</p>\n<p id=\"b999-6\">III. ALLEGATIONS OF WILLFUL AND MALICIOUS CONVERSION</p>\n<p id=\"b999-7\">The most challenging legal issue in this case is whether Long\u2019s conduct should disqualify him from discharge by reason of willful and malicious conversion of Bar-clays\u2019 property. The statutory bar against discharge for \u201cwillful and malicious conversion,\u201d per se (former 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 35(a)(6)), was deleted in the current revision of the Bankruptcy Code, but has been reinstated by interpretation of Congressional intent in enacting 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 523(a)(6). <em>In re Kimzey, </em>761 F.2d 421, 424 (7th Cir.1985). Guided by the understanding that statutory exceptions to discharge are to be narrowly construed, <em>Kimzey, </em>761 F.2d at 424; <em>In re Rahm, </em>641 F.2d 755, 756-57 (9th Cir.), <em>cert. denied sub. nom., Gregg v. Rahm, </em>454 U.S. 360, 102 S.Ct. 313, 70 L.Ed.2d 157 (1981), we preface our discussion of the exception\u2019s applicability to Long with a brief survey of its judicial evolution and an attempt to clarify its elements.</p>\n<p id=\"b999-8\">Prior to the enactment of the new Bankruptcy Code, the leading cases on willful and malicious injury in a bankruptcy sense were <em>Tinker v. Colwell, </em>193 U.S. 473, 24 S.Ct. 505, 48 L.Ed. 754 (1904), and <em>Davis v. Aetna Acceptance Co., </em>293 U.S. 328, 55 S.Ct. 151, 79 L.Ed. 393 (1934). <em>Tinker </em>held that a \u201cmalignant spirit\u201d was not an essential element of malice, but that any intentional act which is \u201cwrongful in and of itself, and which necessarily causes injury ... may be said to be done willfully and maliciously.\u201d <em>Tinker, </em>193 U.S. at 487, 24 S.Ct. at 509. Hence, the <em>Tinker </em>court found that \u201cthe law implies that there must be malice\u201d in a debt resulting from \u201ccriminal conversation\u201d with a judgment creditor\u2019s wife. <em>Id. </em>at 490, 24 S.Ct. at 510. Justices Brown, White and Holmes dissented without opinion.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b999-11\">In <em>Davis, </em>the debtor sold a car in which the creditor had a security interest without obtaining the contractually required consent. <em>Davis, </em>293 U.S. at 330, 55 S.Ct. at 152. Despite the conversion, the Court, speaking through Justice Cardozo, found the debt dischargeable absent \u201caggravated features.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 332-33, 55 S.Ct. at 153. It was thus established that a conversion of property (a simple interference with legal rights) is not enough in itself to prevent discharge of a. debt. It has not been established, however, precisely what type of conduct is sufficiently egregious to constitute malice in this context. Moreover, a distinct tension has arisen between the requirement of \u201caggravated features\u201d in <em>Davis </em>and language in <em>Tinker </em>which has been interpreted as applying a \u201creckless disregard\u201d standard.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> This tension has recently been particularly perplexing to bankruptcy courts in the category of cases involving breached security agreements. <em>In re Kimzey, </em>761 F.2d 421, 425 (7th Cir.1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b1000-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"880\">*880</page-number>While variations in factual context explain some of the different results found in current eases, we agree with Barclays that two distinct approaches are emerging at the trial court level. One line of cases tends to view a breach of a security agreement, if knowingly done, as an obvious intentional harm to the <em>legal </em>rights of the creditor, and therefore rather easily characterized as \u201cwillful and malicious.\u201d <em>See, e.g., United Bank of Southgate v. Nelson, </em>35 B.R. 766 (N.D.Ill.1983), and cases cited; <em>Matter of Ries, </em>22 B.R. 343 (Bkrtcy.W.D.Wisc.1982). Another line of cases treats the breach of the security agreement or similar arrangement as a \u201ctechnical conversion\u201d under the <em>Davis </em>case, and requires a stronger showing of malice or intent to harm than may simply be inferred from the breach. <em>See, e.g., In re Cecchini, </em>37 B.R. 671 (Bkrtcy.App. 9th Cir.1984); <em>In re Gallaudet, </em>46 B.R. 918 (Bkrtcy.D.Vt.1985) (citing cases); <em>In re Levitan, </em>46 B.R. 380 (Bkrtcy.E.D.N.Y.1985); <em>In re Simpson, </em>29 B.R. 202, 212-13 (Bkrtcy.N.D.Iowa 1983) (Thinnes, J.); <em>Matter of Langer, </em>12 B.R. 957 (D.N.D.1981) (Benson, Chief Judge); <em>Matter of Graham, </em>7 B.R. 5 (Bkrtcy.D.Nev.1980); <em>In re Hodges, </em>4 B.R. 513 (Bkrtcy.W.D.Va.1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b1000-4\">The only pertinent ruling by a Bankruptcy Appellate Panel holds there must be \u201cintent to cause injury\u201d rather than merely an \u201cintentional act which causes an injury.\u201d <em>In re Cecchini, supra, </em>at 675. <em>Cecchini </em>was very recently cited as authoritative in a Tenth Circuit decision, ruling that mere reckless disregard of the rights of others would not suffice to prevent discharge of a debt under \u00a7 523(a)(6). <em>In re Compos, </em>768 F.2d 1155 (10th Cir.1985). Judge Timbers, sitting by designation, declined to give retroactive effect to legislation enacted in 1984 which specifically prescribed nondis-chargeability for debts incurred as the re-suit of injuries caused by driving while intoxicated.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Another appellate decision holds that a conversion justifying punitive damages under state law does not necessarily preclude discharge of the debt in bankruptcy. <em>In re Held, </em>734 F.2d 628 (11th Cir.1984). Per Chief Judge Godbold, the <em>Held </em>court wrote that the state court judgment may have been based on a finding of mere \u201creckless indifference to the rights\u201d of the injured parties, and that this reflected the discarded Tinker-based rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b1000-7\">We are quite aware that there are many expressions of dissatisfaction with discharging debts incurred through intentional breach of security agreements, where the debtor\u2019s intent to repay, and thereby prevent economic loss, has been shown to be unrealistic if not insincere. Such dissatisfaction was expressed in the recent ease of <em>In re Clark, </em>50 B.R. 122 (Bkrtcy.D.N.D.1985), where the bankruptcy judge \u201coverruled\u201d the intent-to-harm standard of <em>Hodges </em>and later cases, as applied by a predecessor judge and affirmed by the district court in <em>Matter of Langer, </em>12 B.R. 957 (D.N.D.1981).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1000-8\">The difficulty which the lower courts are currently encountering in applying \u00a7 523(a)(6) seems attributable, at least in part, to the frequent failure to separately analyze the elements of malice and willfulness. Despite the general difficulty in applying the \u00a7 523(a)(6) exception, there is a virtual consensus of opinion that \u201cwillful,\u201d standing alone, means intentional or deliberate. <em>See, e.g., Matter of Morgan, </em>22 B.R. 38, 39 (Bkrtcy.D.Neb.1982); <em>In re Tanner, </em>31 B.R. 338, 339 (Bkrtcy.S.D.Fla.1983). It is the definition of malice, or the disregard of it as a separate term, which has been troublesome.</p>\n<p id=\"b1000-9\">Congress tells us in \u00a7 523(a)(6) that malice and willfulness are two different char<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"881\">*881</page-number>acteristics. They should not be lumped together to create an amorphous standard to prevent discharge for any conduct that may be judicially considered to be deplorable. We are convinced that if malice, as it is used in \u00a7 523(a)(6), is to have any meaning independent of willful it must apply only to conduct more culpable than that which is in reckless disregard of creditors\u2019 economic interests and expectancies, as distinguished from mere legal rights. Moreover, knowledge that legal rights are being violated is insufficient to establish malice, absent some additional \u201caggravated circumstances,\u201d under <em>Davis </em>and its recent progeny.</p>\n<p id=\"b1001-5\">Having determined that a heightened level of culpability must be found, going beyond recklessness and beyond intentional violation of a security interest, we turn to the task of articulating a workable standard. The bankruptcy courts have frequently attempted to define this level of culpability by speaking in terms of intentional harm. Malice is thus being given a meaning more nearly coinciding with common usage. One perceptive case turns to the Restatement (Second) of Torts, \u00a7 8A, Comment b, and uses intentional harm as a requirement for the bar to discharge, with the qualification that the expected harm must be \u201ccertain or substantially certain\u201d to occur. <em>In re Fercho, </em>39 B.R. 764, 766 (Bkrtcy.D.N.D.1984). The Restatement observes that this is a stricter test of fault than the standard of recklessness. It is also consistent with the previously quoted <em>Tinker </em>language, allowing a finding of malice when conduct <em>\u201cnecessarily </em>causes injury.\u201d 193 U.S. at 487, 24 S.Ct. at 509 (emphasis added). This phrase in <em>Tinker </em>has apparently not been criticized in the recent cases. Until a better definition can be formulated for use in this context, we accept the Restatement definition as helping to focus inquiry in applying the statutory \u201cwillful and malicious injury\u201d requirement. When transfers in breach of security agreements are in issue, we believe non-dischargeability turns on whether the conduct is (1) headstrong and knowing (\u201cwillful\u201d) and, (2) targeted at the creditor (\u201cmalicious\u201d), at least in the sense that the conduct is certain or almost certain to cause financial harm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1001-8\">This test seems to explain most of the recent cases favoring debtors when malicious conversion is alleged. It is a standard that at least partially satisfies the complaint of secured creditors who have been \u201cdone wrong\u201d that they are faced with almost impossible obstacles in asserting nondischargeability because of actual malice. While intentional harm may be very difficult to establish, the likelihood of harm in an objective sense may be considered in evaluating intent.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Use of objective information to ascertain intent to cause harm is by no means unfamiliar. <em>Bogard v. Cook, </em>586 F.2d 399, 412 (5th Cir.1978), <em>cert. denied </em>444 U.S. 883, 100 S.Ct. 173, 62 L.Ed.2d 113 (1979) (appraising official immunity defense); <em>Hanke v. Global Van Lines, Inc., </em>533 F.2d 396, 400 (8th Cir.1976) (tort liability of moving company).</p>\n<p id=\"b1001-9\">Returning to the present facts, we believe that Long\u2019s conduct was unquestionably \u201cwillful,\u201d as that term is commonly understood and for bankruptcy purposes. Long acknowledges that he knew the diversion of funds to a corporate account rather than the \u201ccollateral\u201d account was contrary to the contractual arrangement with Bar-clays. The breach of contract was thus a flagrant one, born of apparent desperation over the financial plight of A &amp; C. The more serious barrier to Barclays\u2019 claim is presented by the requirement that there be a finding of malice. There are more <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"882\">*882</page-number>factors favoring Barclays than there were favoring the creditor in <em>Davis. </em>As found by the courts below, Long was gambling with Barclays\u2019 property.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Long testified candidly that he knew he was breaking the contract with Barclays by diverting money from the collateral account. He does not contend he supposed Barclays would have consented to the diversion, even in light of his purported purpose of saving the business and preventing losses to all creditors, including secured creditors whose security might prove inadequate on forced liquidation. While there were arguably some expenditures for his personal benefit, insofar as losses were shifted to Barclays they resulted in further liability on Long\u2019s guar-antys.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> While Long admitted some \u201cinadvertent\u201d use of the diverted moneys, in that all was not used for the intended purpose of meeting \u201ccritical\u201d corporate obligations, the admission apparently relates to items such as a $38 payment for an airline guide. Such expenditures are <em>de minimis, </em>considering the magnitude of the claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b1002-4\">Barclays questions the payment of $35,-000 to attorneys, allegedly for the aborted reorganization effort and other matters relating to the corporate bankruptcy. While the reorganization effort collapsed about two weeks after the transfers, the effort was not necessarily a sham or hopeless from the beginning. Long testified he hoped Barclays could be induced to financially support the reorganization. When this hope vanished, the effort collapsed. There is nothing inherently incredible in this explanation. There was no testimony disputing solicitation of Barclays by Long and his attorneys. Nor was there testimony showing that the attorneys\u2019 fees were used for advice and assistance on Long\u2019s personal affairs, as Barclays speculates.</p>\n<p id=\"b1002-9\">The bankruptcy court and the district judge were entitled to rely on Long\u2019s undisputed testimony as to his intent to benefit Barclays and other creditors as well as himself. <em>See, e.g., Matter of Citizens Loan &amp; Sav. Co., </em>621 F.2d 911, 913 (8th Cir.1980). If the business could have been saved, Barclays could have benefitted by hundreds of thousands of dollars. While Long may have committed a tort, and his conduct must be disapproved, we are not convinced that there was error below in ruling that he did not act maliciously, as that term is used in this context.</p>\n<p id=\"b1002-10\">Debtors who willfully break security agreements are testing the outer bounds of their right to a fresh start, but unless they act with malice by intending or fully expecting to harm the economic interests of the creditor, such a breach of contract does not, in and of itself, preclude a discharge. If Congress wishes to tighten or redefine the nondischargeability rule in question, it can amend the Code as it did last year to prevent discharge from drunk driving damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b1002-11\">The judgment below is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b997-8\">. The debtor in this case is Long. The debtor whose financial condition was allegedly misrepresented is A &amp; C. There is no allegation and no finding that A &amp; C was an alter ego of Long\u2019s. There is authority, however, as noted by Judge Kressel, making an individual debtor responsible for a misrepresentation benefitting his corporation. 44 B.R. at 308. Barclays also asserts the debt should not be discharged by virtue of 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 523(a)(2)(A). Sections 523(a)(2)(A) and 523(a)(2)(B) are, however, expressly mutually exclusive. The only misrepresentations alleged are those regarding the value of inventory which are \"statements in writing respecting the debtor\u2019s or an insider\u2019s financial condition.\u201d Section 523(a)(2)(A) is therefore inapplicable by its terms.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b997-13\">. It is certainly arguable that Long, who made the heavily-discounted purchase in question, and who presumably knew that the computer operator would simply add the volume of the new purchases to the existing inventory of higher cost merchandise, should have realized that this segment of the inventory would be given an artificially high \u201ccost\u201d valuation. Long testified, however, that he had many personal and business distractions at the time, and it would apparently have been unprecedented for him to suggest that the computer operators set up a special account for this particular discounted merchandise. Shortly after these purchases, the controller, whose awareness was presumably at least equal to Long's, argued for an increase in inventory valuation by some $60,000 because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"878\">*878</page-number>the inventory as a whole had been given a \"conservative\u201d valuation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b998-8\">. We are aware that many states, including Minnesota, statutorily define a corporate officer as a fiduciary with respect to the corporation and its shareholders. <em>See </em>Minn.Stat. \u00a7 520.01. Draining a corporation\u2019s assets for the personal benefit of an officer may thus create a bar to discharge. <em>John P. Maguire &amp; Co. v. Herzog, </em>421 F.2d 419 (5th Cir.1970), and cases therein cited. This is different, however, from making officers fiduciaries with respect to third party creditors, as Barclays would have us rule.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b999-9\">. Other language in the <em>Tinker </em>opinion has been the source of a rule that a \"reckless disregard\u201d of the rights of creditors will prevent discharge of the debt created by injurious conduct. It has been observed by a number of courts since the enactment of the new Bankruptcy Code that there is \"legislative history underlying \u00a7 523(a)(6)\u201d that has \"made it clear that conduct which was merely reckless did not rise to the level of \u2018willful and malicious\u2019.\u201d <em>E.g., In re Adams, </em>761 F.2d 1422, 1426 (9th Cir.1985). <em>See </em>H.R.Rep. No. 595, 95th Cong., 1st Sess. 365; reprinted in 1978 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News 5787, 5963, 6320-21, expressing some disapproval of language in <em>Tinker </em>and stating that \"to the extent that other cases have relied on <em>Tinker </em>to apply a \u2018reckless disregard\u2019 standard, they are overruled.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b999-13\">. <em>See supra </em>note 4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b1000-5\">. The Ninth Circuit has, by contrast, given retroactive effect to the new legislation. <em>In re Adams, supra. </em>We need not deal with the conflicting results in those cases on the narrow issue of retroactivity, but we have already noted that <em>Adams </em>is consistent with <em>Compos </em>in requiring a very high level of personal misconduct, going beyond mere recklessness, before a debt is deemed nondischargeable for \u201cwillful and malicious injury.\u201d <em>See supra </em>note 4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b1000-11\">. We intimate no views on the final outcome of <em>Clark, </em>where the facts conceivably may sufficiently favor the creditor as to allow affirmance under the rule stated today.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b1001-6\">. We have considered whether a remand should occur to allow Barclays to seek an express finding on the issue of Long\u2019s willingness to inflict \"substantially certain\u201d injury. It is inherently unlikely, however, Long knew he was \"throwing good money after bad,\u201d despite the fact that he gave up hope in a matter of weeks. Moreover, Judge Kressel believed Long had not been shown to have \u201ca willingness to voluntarily inflict injury.\u201d While this formulation seems somewhat imprecise, it is probably unduly favorable to Barclays, and a remand does not seem appropriate under the circumstances. The factual basis for the ruling is not clearly deficient, as explained below.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b1002-5\">. We do have some doubt that a technical conversion occurred, as the money involved was payable to A &amp; C for merchandise owned by A &amp; C. <em>See Matter of Banister, </em>737 F.2d 225 (2d Cir.1984), <em>cert. denied sub. nom., Wachovia Bank and Trust Co. v. Banister, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 105 S.Ct. 509, 83 L.Ed.2d 400 (1985), and <em>Davis v. Aetna Acceptance Co., </em>293 U.S. at 330, 55 S.Ct. at 152, where the Supreme Court was untroubled by the bankrupt\u2019s breach of an agreement to remit the proceeds of the sale in question. The courts below did not deal with this question of state law, and we assume arguendo there was a conversion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b1002-13\">. This distinguishes the situation in <em>John P. Maguire &amp; Co. v. Herzog, </em>421 F.2d 419 (5th Cir.1970), where the corporate officer, Herzog, was apparently not a guarantor of debts to a floor-plan creditor. It will be further observed that the district court in that case found no \"willful and malicious injuries,\u201d so the ruling somewhat favors Long on the point presently being considered. In certain of the bankruptcy cases cited, moreover, some personal or family gain from the conversion has been held not to preclude a discharge.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
