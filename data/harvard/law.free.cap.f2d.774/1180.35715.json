Upon consideration of the foregoing, it is</p>\n<p id=\"b1300-22\">ORDERED, by the Court en <em>banc, </em>that the suggestion is denied.</p>\n<author id=\"b1300-23\">WALD, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b1300-24\">Because of the relative infrequency of trademark litigation in our circuit and in light of our present extremely limited judicial resources, I am not calling for an <em>en banc </em>of this decision, although I continue to believe, for the reasons expressed in my dissent, that it does not represent a correct construction of the applicable law or precedents.</p>\n<author id=\"b1300-25\">STARR, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b1300-26\">The panel decision in this ease creates an unnecessary chink in the armor of the American Rule with respect to attorneys\u2019 fees, a settled principle roundly reaffirmed by the Supreme Court in <em>Alyeska Pipeline Service Co. v. Wilderness Society, </em>421 U.S. 240, 95 S.Ct. 1612, 44 L.Ed.2d 141 (1975). In doing so, the result seems to me at odds with the teaching fairly to be derived from the Supreme Court\u2019s decisions in <em>Hanra-han v. Hampton, </em>446 U.S. 754, 100 S.Ct. 1987, 64 L.Ed.2d 67 (1980), and <em>Ruckel-shaus v. Sierra Club, </em>463 U.S. 680, 688, 103 S.Ct. 3274, 3279, 77 L.Ed.2d 938 (1983). To be a \u201cprevailing party,\u201d a litigant must win something <em>on the merits. </em>To be sure, Firefighter English and his barbecue business in San Francisco have won a not inconsiderable victory in rebuffing Noxell\u2019s effort to litigate this case a continent away from the Golden State; but the die of this litigation is not yet cast. We have no inkling whatever as to the ultimate disposition on the merits of Noxell\u2019s trademark infringement action when that case is refiled, as Noxell represents that it intends to do, in the Northern District of California. Corrected Petition for Rehearing at 8 n. 3. Until we do, my reading of <em>Hanrahan </em>and <em>Ruckelshaus </em>persuades me that we should, in the specific statutory setting of the Lan-ham Act, abstain from giving the already-boiling pot of attorneys\u2019 fees litigation yet another stir.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
