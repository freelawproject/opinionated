FACTS.</p>\n<p id=\"b1583-6\">In September 1976, plaintiff John Can-field (Canfield) was hired by Mayor George Sullivan (Sullivan) as head of the Public Transit Division within the Department of Transportation of the Municipality of Anchorage. Canfield served a six-month probationary period and then became a permanent employee. On October 19, 1979, Can-field was summarily dismissed by James Dunn (Dunn), Director of Transportation. On November 5, Dunn wrote Canfield explaining that his dismissal resulted from \u201clong term organizational deficiencies\u201d regarding: improper handling of employee relations, inattention to administrative duties, general management deficiencies, and overall lack of confidence in his ability to manage the Transit Division to the administration\u2019s satisfaction. Canfield\u2019s dismissal was approved by Mayor Sullivan. The Municipality subsequently refused to participate in any grievance procedures.</p>\n<p id=\"b1583-7\">Canfield filed the present action on March 20, 1980. He alleged that he had been denied due process and equal protection; that the city ordinances, if interpreted to provide that Canfield was an \u201cat will\u201d employee, conflicted with the Anchorage Home Rule Charter (Charter) and were invalid; and that the city had violated the Intergovernmental Personnel Act (IPA), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 4701-72 (1976 &amp; Supp.1981). The district court concluded that Canfield was an \u201cexecutive\u201d serving at the pleasure of the mayor and that Canfield lacked a property interest in continued employment. The district court also rejected Canfield\u2019s liberty interest, equal protection, and IPA claims, and granted summary judgment for the defendants on October 1, 1980.</p>\n<p id=\"b1583-8\">On appeal, 685 F.2d 440 (9th Cir.1982), we reversed in an unpublished opinion and remanded for factual findings on the applicable ordinances and Personnel Rules. The district court made the requested findings on remand and reaffirmed its earlier decision granting summary judgment for defendants. The present appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1583-9\">II. STANDARD OF REVIEW.</p>\n<p id=\"b1583-10\">Our task in reviewing a grant of summary judgment is \u201cidentical to that of the trial court.\u201d <em>M/V American Queen v. San Diego Marine Construction Corp., </em>708 F.2d 1483, 1487 (9th Cir.1983). Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the party opposing summary judgment, we review <em>de novo </em>whether there was no genuine issue of material fact and whether the moving party was entitled to judgment as a matter of law. <em>Id.; Lojek v. Thomas, </em>716 F.2d 675, 677 (9th Cir.1983). The district court\u2019s interpretation of state law, including state statutes, is also subject to <em>de novo </em>review. <em>See In re McLinn, </em>739 F.2d 1395, 1397-98 (9th Cir.1984) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b1583-11\">III. ANALYSIS.</p>\n<p id=\"b1583-12\">A. Interpretation of Anchorage\u2019s Person- , nel Rules.</p>\n<p id=\"b1583-14\">Whether Canfield possessed a protectible property interest in his employment is defined by reference to state law, including city ordinances. <em>Bishop v. Wood, </em>426 U.S. 341, 344 &amp; n. 7, 96 S.Ct. 2074, 2077 &amp; n. 7, 48 L.Ed.2d 684 (1976). <em>See also Loehr v. Ventura County Community College Dist., </em>743 F.2d 1310, 1314 (9th Cir.1984). Under Alaska law, \u201c[a] person who is employed \u2018at the pleasure\u2019 of his employer has no \u2018property\u2019 interest in continued employment that is protected by due process.\u201d <em>Breeden v. City of Nome, </em>628 P.2d 924, 926 (Alaska 1981) (per curiam). General principles of statutory construction apply in the present case in interpreting Anchorage\u2019s personnel ordinances. <em>See Stanfill v. City of Fairbanks, </em>659 P.2d 579, 581 (Alaska 1983). Thus, the sections of the personnel ordinances \u201cmust be construed so that each has meaning and the sections do not conflict with each other.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1583-15\">The version of Anchorage\u2019s Personnel Rules in effect at the time of Canfield\u2019s hiring and dismissal was set forth in Anchorage Ordinance (AO) 48-76 as amended <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1468\">*1468</page-number>by AO 76-76. <em>See </em>Anchorage, Alaska, Ordinance 48-76 (April 5, 1976) &amp; Ordinance 76-76 (May 4, 1976). Under Anchorage\u2019s Personnel Rules, as adopted in AO 48-76, an \u201cexecutive\u201d employee is appointed by and serves at the pleasure of the mayor. Personnel Rule 17.7. We must determine whether the district court correctly concluded that Canfield was an \u201cexecutive\u201d who could be dismissed \u201cat will\u201d by the mayor.</p>\n<p id=\"b1584-4\">The terms \u201cexecutive position\u201d and \u201cexecutive employee\u201d are defined in Personnel Rules 17.1(a) and (b), respectively. As it originally appeared in AO 48-76, subsection (a) of Rule 17.1 erroneously contained a definition of \u201cexecutive employee\u201d identical to the definition in subsection (b). We agree with the district court that Rule 17.-1(a) appearing in AO 48-76 contained a clerical error and that it was intended to define \u201cexecutive position\u201d as follows: \u201cAn executive position is a regular full-time position which involves principal responsibility for carrying out policies and programs.\u201d The district court\u2019s interpretation gives meaning to both subsections (a) and (b) of Rule 17.1 and is in accordance with the 1980 amendment adding the phrase \u201cor part-time\u201d after \u201cfull-time\u201d in Rule 17.1(a). <em>See </em>Anchorage, Alaska, Ordinance 79-195 (Jan. 15, 1980). The definition of \u201cexecutive position\u201d adopted by the district court also coincides with, but is slightly different from, the version of Rule 17.1(a) (\u201cAn executive position is a regular full-time position which involves principal responsibility for the determination of policy and the way in which policies are carried out.\u201d) which was deleted by AO 48-76.</p>\n<p id=\"b1584-5\">AO 76-76 classifies \u201cPublic Transportation Manager\u201d as an executive position. Canfield argues that he was the Public <em>Transit </em>Manager and therefore was not an executive under AO 76-76 and Rule 17.7. However, defendant Dunn testified that there are five divisions within the Department of Transportation \u2014 Port of Anchorage, Merrill Field (the airport within city limits), traffic engineering, transit, and transportation inspection. AO 76-76 classifies as executives four of the five division heads within the Department \u2014 Port Manager, Airport Manager, Traffic Engineer, and Public Transportation Manager. The title \u201cPublic Transportation Manager\u201d listed in AO 76-76 appears to have no meaning unless it refers to the position held by Canfield. We agree with the district court that the title \u201cPublic Transportation Manager\u201d is synonymous with \u201cPublic Transit Manager.\u201d Such an interpretation is consistent with the Assembly\u2019s willingness to classify some division heads as executives and gives meaning to the title \u201cPublic Transportation Manager\u201d used by the Assembly. Classifying Canfield\u2019s job as an executive position is also consistent with the definition of \u201cexecutive position\u201d set forth in Personnel Rule 17.1(a). Canfield was therefore an \u201cexecutive\u201d under AO 76-76.</p>\n<p id=\"b1584-8\">Canfield\u2019s argument that he could not have known that he was an \u201cexecutive\u201d is without merit. Canfield served a probationary period but incorrectly argues that probation is not required for \u201cexecutives.\u201d Defendant Dunn testified that \u201cmost of the executive appointments have probationary periods associated with them.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Excerpt of Record, at 758. More importantly, Can-field received numerous personnel communications indicating that he was an executive. In summary, we agree with the district court\u2019s conclusion that Canfield was an \u201cexecutive\u201d under the relevant ordinances and Personnel Rules.</p>\n<p id=\"b1584-9\">B. Conflict Between Personnel Rules and Home Rule Charter.</p>\n<p id=\"b1584-10\">The interpretation of municipal charters, like the interpretation of ordi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1469\">*1469</page-number>nances, is governed by rules of statutory construction. <em>City &amp; Borough of Sitka v. International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, Local Union 1547, </em>653 P.2d 332, 335-36 (Alaska 1982). Although we have not found any Alaska case on point, the general rule applied in other jurisdictions is that an ordinance is invalid if it conflicts with a city\u2019s charter. <em>See Lucchesi v. City of San Jose, </em>104 Cal.App.3d 323, 327-28, 163 Cal.Rptr. 700, 702-03 (1980); <em>Portland Police Association v. Civil Service Board, </em>292 Or. 433, 639 P.2d 619, 623 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b1585-5\">Section 5.02(a) of Anchorage\u2019s Charter provides that \u201c[t]he Mayor shall appoint all heads of municipal departments, subject to confirmation by the Assembly, on the basis of professional qualifications. Persons appointed by the Mayor serve at the pleasure of the Mayor.\u201d Anchorage, Alaska, Home Rule Charter (Charter) art. V, \u00a7 5.02(a). The defendants do not dispute that Can-field was not a department head under section 5.02(a). Instead, they argue that section 5.02(a) does not expressly prohibit the Assembly from expanding the Mayor\u2019s executive appointment power. Thus, defendants contend that the Assembly is not prohibited from creating new \u201cexecutive\u201d positions in addition to those set forth in article V of the Charter. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b1585-6\">We have not found any Alaska case directly on point. However, the California Supreme Court has held that \u201c[a] city charter is construed to permit the exercise of all powers not expressly limited by the charter or by superior state or federal law. Restrictions on a charter city\u2019s powers may not be implied.\u201d <em>Taylor v. Crane, </em>24 Cal.3d 442, 450-51, 155 Cal.Rptr. 695, 700, 595 P.2d 129, 134 (1979) (citation omitted). Other state courts have reached the same conclusion. <em>See Tipco Corp. v. City of Billings, </em>197 Mont. 339, 642 P.2d 1074, 1077 (1982) (city \u201cmay exercise any power not prohibited by the Constitution, Law or Charter\u201d); <em>Grayson v. Oregon, </em>249 Or. 92, 436 P.2d 261, 264 (1968) (\u201ccity charter is a grant of authority, and not a limitation upon it\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1585-8\">In this case, the Charter does not expressly prohibit the Anchorage Assembly from creating new \u201cexecutive\u201d positions. In addition, section 17.11(b) of the Charter provides that the Charter provisions \u201cmay not be construed as implied limitations on other municipal activities not prohibited by law.\u201d We conclude that the Charter does not limit the Assembly\u2019s power to create additional \u201cexecutive\u201d positions. <em>See Miller v. City of Sacramento, </em>66 Cal.App.3d 863, 867-70, 136 Cal.Rptr. 315, 318-20 (1977). The Personnel Rules therefore do not conflict with the Charter. As an \u201cexecutive\u201d serving at the pleasure of the may- or, Canfield lacked any property interest in his employment and he received the limited due process protections to which he was entitled as an \u201cat will\u201d employee. <em>See Breeden, </em>628 P.2d at 926.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1585-9\">C. Equal Protection Claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b1585-10\">Canfield also contends that the Personnel Rules deny him equal protection under the fourteenth amendment to the United States Constitution. Because there is no fundamental right to government employment and no suspect class alleged in this case, the Personnel Rules are valid if they are \u201crationally related to furthering a legitimate state interest.\u201d <em>Massachusetts Board of Retirement v. Murgia, </em>427 U.S. 307, 312-13, 96 S.Ct. 2562, 2566, 49 L.Ed.2d 520 (1976) (per curiam). <em>See Lamb v. Scripps College, </em>627 F.2d 1015, 1018-19 (9th Cir.1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b1585-11\">Merit employment systems uniformly distinguish between classified and executive employees. Whether particular division heads should be included within the executive class involves linedrawing by the Assembly. \u201cSuch [line-drawing] by the legislature is presumed valid.\u201d <em>Murgia, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1470\">*1470</page-number>427 U.S. at 314, 96 S.Ct. at 2567. In this case, Canfield headed the Public Transit Division which had annual revenues of approximately $500,000. Canfield\u2019s position involved making and enforcing policy decisions. The Assembly\u2019s classification of Canfield\u2019s position as an executive one was rational.</p>\n<p id=\"b1586-4\">D. Intergovernmental Personnel Act Claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b1586-5\">Canfield seeks relief under the IPA claiming that the Personnel Rules violate that statute. The purpose of the IPA is to provide \u201cFederal financial and technical assistance to State and local governments for strengthening their personnel administration in a manner consistent with [merit] principles.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 4701. Under the IPA, state and local governments are required to maintain merit employment systems in order to receive certain federal grants. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 4722, 4743 &amp; 4766.</p>\n<p id=\"b1586-6\">The Eleventh Circuit recently affirmed a district court decision holding that no private cause of action exists under the IPA. <em>See Howkins v. Caldwell, </em>587 F.Supp. 98, 107 (N.D.Ga.1984) (on reh\u2019g), <em>aff'd mem., </em>749 F.2d 731 (11th Cir.1984), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 105 S.Ct. 2361, 86 L.Ed.2d 261 (1985). The district court in <em>Howkins </em>succinctly stated its rationale:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1586-9\">According to the [IPA], the United States Office of Personnel Management is the only body capable of enforcing the IPA\u2019s substantive provisions, and it accomplishes this through the \u201ctermination of grants\u201d section. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 4767. Since this court finds no evidence \u2014 clear, affirmative, or otherwise \u2014 of Congress\u2019 intent to create a private right of action in the IPA, [plaintiff] has no claim under the IPA.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1586-10\"><em>Howkins, </em>587 F.Supp. at 107. We agree with the decision in <em>Howkins </em>and conclude that Canfield cannot state a claim under the IPA.</p>\n<p id=\"b1586-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1584-6\">. It is unclear whether probationary periods for executives are mandated by the Personnel Rules. <em>Compare </em>Personnel Rules 17.4 &amp; 17.5(b) (deleting reference to probationary periods for executives) <em>with </em>Personnel Rules 7.1 &amp; 17.8 (arguably permitting probationary periods for executives). In any event, the fact that most executives serve a probationary period undercuts Canfield\u2019s argument that he was not treated as a executive because he served a probationary period.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1585-12\"><em>. </em>Canfield briefly argues that he was also deprived of a liberty interest. Canfield\u2019s briefs on the original appeal (No. 80-3478) contained no reference to the liberty interest issue. Canfield therefore previously abandoned this issue and we do not address it here. <em>See International Union of Bricklayers Local Union No. 20 v. Martin Jaska, Inc., </em>752 F.2d 1401, 1404 (9th Cir.1985).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
