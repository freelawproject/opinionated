McCahey seeks injunctive, declaratory, and monetary relief on the grounds that New York\u2019s post-judgment remedies deprived her of property without due process. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-25\">Background</p>\n<p id=\"b664-26\">1. <em>The Underlying Dispute</em></p>\n<p id=\"b664-27\">Because the complaint was dismissed for failure to state a claim, we accept its allegations as true. <em>Gardener v. Toilet Goods Association, </em>387 U.S. 167, 172, 87 S.Ct. 1526, 1529, 18 L.Ed.2d 704 (1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b665-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>According to the complaint, McCahey is a single mother of three children. She and her family are dependent for support on the Aid to Families with Dependent Children program (\u201cAFDC\u201d). On October 13, 1982, L.P. Investors obtained a default judgment against McCahey for unpaid rent in the amount of $1,979.61. McCahey had notice of the proceeding but did not appear. She does not contest the validity of the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-5\">To collect the judgment, L.P. Investors hired a collection agency, Affiliated Credit Adjusters, which in turn hired an attorney, Allen Rosenthal. On June 14, 1983, Rosen-thal telephoned McCahey and asked her to pay the judgment. McCahey refused, explaining that she did not have sufficient funds and was wholly dependent on AFDC. As evidence of her dependent status, she told Rosenthal her public assistance case number.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-6\">Rosenthal ascertained that McCahey had a checking account at the Island State Bank. The sole source of funds for the account was AFDC. On July 6, the bank received a restraining notice from Rosen-thal directing it to stop all payments on the account. Shortly after July 12, McCahey received a letter from the bank informing her that her account had been restrained. The bank charged her $10 for this notice. Soon thereafter, McCahey called the bank and informed a bank employee that her account consisted entirely of welfare money. The bank employee told McCahey that welfare money was exempt from seizure and promised to contact Rosenthal. About July 18, the bank employee informed McCa-hey that Rosenthal did not believe the account contained only welfare money. The employee also informed McCahey that the bank would nevertheless no longer honor the restraining notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-7\">Also on July 18, McCahey received a formal Notice to Judgment Debtor from Rosenthal. New York law requires that such a notice be sent to judgment debtors whenever their property is restrained. The Notice disclosed the name of the judgment creditor and information about the underlying judgment. It also informed the judgment debtor that property of the debtor has been taken, that some forms of property are exempt from seizure (one example given is welfare such as AFDC), that the debtor may contact \"the person sending this notice\u201d or a lawyer or Legal Aid, and that there is a procedure to get property back if the property is exempt.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-10\">As suggested by the form, McCahey contacted \u201cthe person sending this notice,\u201d i.e. Rosenthal, and informed him that the money in the account was welfare money and thus exempt from seizure. Rosenthal asked her to send him a copy of her welfare check. McCahey\u2019s next check arrived on August 15, and she then sent Rosenthal a copy.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b665-11\">On August 26, at the direction of Rosen-thal, the Sheriff of Suffolk County served an execution on the bank. Three days later, the Sheriff sent another Notice to Judgment Debtor to McCahey, but McCa-hey did not receive it. On August 30, the bank turned over $35.13 to the Sheriff. On September 19, the Sheriff turned over the money to Rosenthal. Rosenthal received only $11 because of sheriff\u2019s fees. When he called the bank to determine why he had received only $11, the bank again informed him that the money in the account was exempt. Nonetheless, on October 4, 1983, the bank paid the Sheriff the entire balance in the account, $406.82.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-12\">At some later date, the plaintiff contacted the Legal Aid Society, as the Notice to Judgment Debtor had recommended. Rather than invoke the procedures provided by New York statute to recover levied property, however, the Legal Aid lawyer attempted to intervene in litigation pending before Judge Lasker, <em>Deary v. Guardian Loan Co., </em>534 F.Supp. 1178 (S.D.N.Y.1982). In that case, Judge Lasker had declared unconstitutional the predecessor statutes of the ones at issue in the instant case and had retained jurisdiction over the issue of whether the instant statutes were constitu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>tional.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Leave to intervene in <em>Deary </em>was denied to McCahey. Nevertheless, Rosen-thal returned McCahey\u2019s money as a consequence of the attempted intervention.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b666-4\">McCahey then instituted the present action to recover for the loss of the use of her money for four and one-half months.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> She claims that during this period she fell behind in her rent and utility payments, skimped on food and clothing, and was afraid to use her bank account.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-5\">2. <em>New York\u2019s Current Post-Judgment Remedies</em></p>\n<p id=\"b666-6\">In <em>Deary, </em>Judge Lasker found that New York\u2019s earlier post-judgment remedies violated due process because they did not provide notice to the debtor that: (i) property had been seized, (ii) such property might be exempt from seizure, or (iii) there were procedures available to contest the seizure. 534 F.Supp. at 1187-88. After Judge Lasker\u2019s decision, the New York legislature enacted the revisions at issue in this case. The revised statutory scheme is set out in the appendices to this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-7\">The current process of enforcing money judgments begins when the attorney for the judgment creditor issues a restraining notice to the holder of the judgment debt- or\u2019s property. (APPENDIX A) The restraining notice includes information about the underlying action and informs the recipient that transfer of property by the debtor is punishable as contempt of court. If the restraining notice is sent to someone other than the judgment debtor, a copy of it must also be mailed to the judgment debtor within four days of service of the notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-11\">In addition to the information supplied by the restraining notice, the notice sent to the judgment debtor must state:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b666-12\">NOTICE TO JUDGMENT DEBTOR</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b666-13\">Money or property belonging to you may have been taken or held in order to satisfy a judgment which has been entered against you. Read this carefully. YOU MAY BE ABLE TO GET YOUR MONEY BACK</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b666-14\">State arid federal laws prevent certain money or property from being taken to satisfy judgments. Such money or property is said to be \u201cexempt\u201d. The following is a partial list of money which may be exempt:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b666-15\">1. Supplemental security income (SSI);</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b666-16\">2. Social security;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b666-17\">3. Public assistance (welfare);</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b666-18\">4. Alimony or child support;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b666-19\">5. Unemployment benefits;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b666-20\">6. Disability benefits;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b666-21\">7. Workers\u2019 compensation benefits;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b666-22\">8. Public or private pensions; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b666-23\">9. Veterans benefits.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b666-24\">If you think that any of your money that has been taken or held is exempt, you must act promptly because the money may be applied to the judgment. If you claim any of your money that has been taken or held is exempt, you may contact the person sending this notice.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b666-25\">Also, YOU MAY CONSULT AN ATTORNEY, INCLUDING LEGAL AID IF YOU QUALIFY. The law (New York civil practice law and rules, article four and sections fifty-two hundred thirty-nine and fifty-two hundred forty) pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>vides a procedure for determination of a claim to an exemption.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b667-5\">In order to obtain possession of the restrained property, the attorney issues an execution to the sheriff. (APPENDIX B) The execution states essentially the same information as the restraining notice. The sheriff then levies on the property by serving the execution on the person in possession. (APPENDIX C) That person must turn over the property to the sheriff \u201cforthwith.\u201d If the execution does not state that a Notice to Judgment Debtor has been sent within the prior year by the attorney, then the sheriff must send yet another Notice within four days of levy. The sheriff must hold the property for at least fifteen days before turning it over to the judgment creditor. (APPENDIX D)</p>\n<p id=\"b667-6\">The judgment debtor has two procedures for disputing seizures. (APPENDIX E) First, by serving notice on the judgment creditor and the sheriff prior to the application of the property to the debt, the judgment debtor can start a \u201cspecial proceeding\u201d to adjudicate rights in the property. Second, at any time, on its own motion or on that of any interested party, the court can issue protective orders. (APPENDIX F) If the debtor makes a motion to adjudicate his rights in the property, the creditor has eight days to file a response. However, the court may shorten that time for cause shown.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-10\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b667-11\">1. <em>The Analytic Framework</em></p>\n<p id=\"Aua\">We first discuss the analytic framework in which McCahey\u2019s challenge to the New York post-judgment remedies must be addressed. We of course assume that McCa-hey\u2019s bank account was exempt from seizure, N.Y.Soc.Serv.L. \u00a7 137 (McKinney 1983), and constituted a property interest of which she could not be deprived, even temporarily, without due process. <em>Fuentes v. Shevin, </em>407 U.S. 67, 84-85, 92 S.Ct. 1983, 1996, 32 L.Ed.2d 556 (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b667-12\">Supreme Court decisions addressing due process limits on post-judgment remedies are so scant that <em>Endicott-Johnson Corp. v. Encyclopedia Press, Inc., </em>266 U.S. 285, 45 S.Ct. 61, 69 L.Ed. 288 (1924), is still frequently cited. The Court held there that a judgment debtor is not constitutionally entitled to notice and a hearing prior to a wage garnishment. The Court viewed the existence of the underlying judgment as sufficient \u201cnotice of what will follow.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 288, 45 S.Ct. at 62, <em>quoting Ayres v. Campbell, </em>9 Iowa 213, 216 (1859).</p>\n<p id=\"b667-13\">Notwithstanding <em>Endicott, </em>post-judgment remedies have been repeatedly challenged under the due process clause in the last decade,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> largely on the grounds that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number><em>Endicott </em>never considered the existence of property exempt under state law from execution that might nevertheless be seized by a creditor if notice and an opportunity to be heard are not accorded the debtor. <em>Endi-cott\u2019s </em>rationale assumed that the judgment resolved all outstanding issues between the debtor and the creditor, collection being a ministerial act. However, the judgment does not resolve whether certain property is exempt, <em>Finberg v. Sullivan, </em>634 F.2d 50, 56-57 (3d Cir.1980) <em>(en banc), </em>and subsequent Supreme Court decisions have implied that <em>Endicott </em>is not the last word on the subject.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-4\"><em>Griffin v. Griffin, </em>327 U.S. 220, 66 S.Ct. 556, 90 L.Ed. 635 (1946), involved the collection of past-due alimony payments arising out of a divorce decree. The Court held that a judgment directing issuance of execution for collection of the unpaid alimony violated due process because it had been obtained <em>ex parte </em>and had cut off defenses available to the husband. Although the majority opinion did not refer to <em>Endicott, </em>debate has arisen over the effect of <em>Griffin </em>on Endicott\u2019s vitality as a precedent.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b668-5\">The expansion of the due process limitations on prejudgment remedies, <em>see North Georgia Finishing, Inc. v. Di-Chem, Inc., </em>419 U.S. 601, 95 S.Ct. 719, 42 L.Ed.2d 751 (1975); <em>Mitchell v. W.T. Grant Co., </em>416 U.S. 600, 94 S.Ct. 1895, 40 L.Ed.2d 406 (1974); <em>Fuentes, </em>407 U.S. 67, 92 S.Ct. 1983, 32 L.Ed.2d 556 (1972); <em>Sniadach v. Family Finance Corp., </em>395 U.S. 337, 89 S.Ct. 1820, 23 L.Ed.2d 349 (1969), has also led to a closer scrutiny of post-judgment remedies because of the partial analogy between the two. While some ambiguity exists, it is generally believed that pre-judgment <em>ex parte </em>attachments are constitutional if issued by a neutral judicial officer on the basis of factual representations regarding the merits of the plaintiffs claim and immediately followed by notice to the defendant and by an opportunity to contest the seizure. <em>See Jonnet v. Dollar Savings Bank, </em>530 F.2d 1123, 1129-30 (3d Cir.1976); Scott, <em>Constitutional Regulation of Provisional Creditor Remedies: The Cost of Procedural Due Process, </em>61 Va.L.Rev. 806, 832-33 (1975).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Of course, the law of pre-judgment remedies, while suggestive, does not automatically govern post-judgment remedies, which are available only after all doubt as to liability has been erased.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-10\">The majority of courts that have recently considered the due process aspects of post-judgment remedies have adopted a balancing analysis derived from <em>Mathews v. Eldridge, </em>424 U.S. 319, 334, 96 S.Ct. 893, 902, 47 L.Ed.2d 18 (1976). As Justice Powell explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b668-11\">[Resolution of ... whether ... procedures provided ... are constitutionally sufficient requires analysis of the governmental and private interests that are affected. More precisely, our prior deci<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>sions indicate that identification of the specific dictates of due process generally requires consideration of three distinct factors: First, the private interest that will be affected by the official action; second, the risk of an erroneous deprivation of such interest through the procedures used, and the probable value, if any, of additional or substitute procedural safeguards; and finally, the Government\u2019s interest, including the function involved and the fiscal and administrative burdens that the additional or substitute procedural requirement would entail.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A-jB\"><em>Id. </em>at 334-35, 96 S.Ct. at 902-03 (citations omitted). We agree that the balancing analysis is applicable.</p>\n<p id=\"aji-dedup-0\">The creditor\u2019s interests are straightforward: a swift, sure and inexpensive mechanism for collecting judgments. This interest is most directly served by allowing creditors to reach bank accounts and other liquid assets, because seizure of those assets is the lowest-cost method of satisfying judgments.</p>\n<p id=\"afp-dedup-0\">The debtor\u2019s interest in preserving nonexempt property for his or her own use is of course subservient to the creditor\u2019s judgment. However, the debtor has a clearly legitimate interest in protecting exempt property from seizure.</p>\n<p id=\"A_P\">The state has several interests in the matters at hand. First, it has an interest in providing inexpensive and rapid methods of collecting judgments, as part of its more general interest in ensuring compliance with its laws. Second, it has an interest in the efficient use of judicial resources, so they are not wasted in proceedings of little value. Finally, the state has an interest in seeing that laws exempting property from seizure are not evaded.</p>\n<p id=\"AdA\">McCahey challenges the New York procedures on five grounds, all rooted in due process. She claims: (i) judgment debtors are entitled to notice and a hearing before seizure of their property; (ii) if pre-seizure remedies are not required, seizure may occur only on the order of a neutral judicial officer after disclaimer by the judgment debtor of knowledge of any exemptions; (iii) the New York Notice to Judgment Debtor does not adequately explain the procedure for pressing an exemption claim; (iv) by recommending that the debtor contact \u201cthe person sending this notice,\u201d the New York Notice to Judgment Debtor misleads the debtor into thinking that \u201cthe person,\u201d who will usually be the attorney for the creditor, will protect the debtor\u2019s rights; and (v) the New York procedure for adjudicating exemption claims does not provide a sufficiently prompt opportunity to contest the levy,</p>\n<p id=\"APJ\">2. <em>The Requirements of Due Process for Post-Judgment Seizure of a Debtor\u2019s Property</em></p>\n<p id=\"ahg-dedup-0\">The district court concluded that post-judgment remedies satisfy due process requirements if they provide: (i) notice to judgment debtors that their property had keen seized, (ii) notice to judgment debtors 0f exemptions to which they may be entitied; and (iii) a prompt opportunity for judgment debtors to challenge the seizure and assert their exemptions. <em>Deary, </em>534 F.Supp. at 1187-88. The majority of courts have reached similar conclusions, <em>see, e.g., Finberg, </em>634 F.2d at 59-62; <em>Dionne v. Bouley, </em>757 F.2d 1344, 1354 (1st Cir.1985), and we also believe these requirements strike a fair balance between the competing interests.</p>\n<p id=\"AeE\">it is certainly clear that judgment debt-0rs are entitled to at least this much protection. Providing post-seizure notice of the fact of the seizure is an elemental requirement of due process, <em>see Mullane v. Central Hanover Bank &amp; Trust Co., </em>339 U.S. 306, 70 S.Ct. 652, 94 L.Ed. 865 (1950), and, because the assets cannot thereafter be transferred or hidden by the debtor without court authority, post-seizure notice adds little to the cost of collection. Providing notice of possible exemptions and a prompt opportunity to be heard on claims of exemption add costs to the collection of judgments but also enhance the likelihood that the exemptions provided under state law will be recognized.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>McCahey argues that additional procedural protections must be accorded debtors before seizure: specifically notice and a hearing. We disagree. That level of procedural protection for debtors is not constitutionally required even in the case of prejudgment attachments, when liability has not been determined. A fortiori, it can hardly be required where the creditor\u2019s claim has been finally confirmed by a court, and where the risk that the debtor will conceal assets is stronger than in the prejudgment context. For those reasons, we agree with the great majority of courts that have considered and rejected this suggestion. <em>See, e.g., Dionne, </em>757 F.2d at 1352; <em>Brown v. Liberty Loan Corp., </em>539 F.2d 1355, 1363 (5th Cir.1976); <em>Huggins v. Deinhard, </em>134 Ariz. 98, 654 P.2d 32, 37 (1982); <em>Cole v. Goldberger, Pedersen &amp; Hochron, </em>95 Misc.2d 720, 410 N.Y.S.2d 950, 955-56 (1978); <em>but see Coursin v. Harper, </em>236 Ga. 729, 225 S.E.2d 428, 430 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b670-4\">McCahey also suggests that if <em>ex parte </em>orders are permitted, they must be issued only by neutral judicial officers on the basis of affidavits submitted by judgment creditors disclaiming knowledge of the existence of any exemptions the debtor may assert. We believe neither step is required by due process, because their cost is outweighed by any benefits they might produce. The need for involving a neutral judicial officer is minimal because of the existence of the underlying judgment, which, even if rendered by default, involved a court at some point in the process. <em>Finberg, </em>634 F.2d at 62; <em>Brown, </em>539 F.2d at 1369; <em>see Scott, </em>61 Va.L.Rev. at 853-56. A requirement that the creditor swear to ignorance of any possible exemptions likewise adds little but cost. Even if the debt- or asserts an exemption to the creditor before seizure, the creditor still has a right to have that assertion adjudicated. <em>See, e.g., Finberg, </em>634 F.2d at 62; <em>Cole, </em>410 N.Y.S.2d at 956. Moreover, the debtor is in the best position to provide evidence of the exemption and may legitimately be required to carry the burden of proving its existence. <em>See, e.g., McCormick on Evidence </em>950 (3d ed. 1984) (\u201cwhere the facts with regard to an issue lie peculiarly in the knowledge of the party, that party has the burden of proving the issue\u201d); Fed.R.Civ.P. 8(c) (burden on defendant to prove payment, discharge in bankruptcy, and license). We thus conclude that New York\u2019s statutory scheme provides sufficient notice and otherwise meets due process standards as far as the initial seizure is concerned.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-6\">3. <em>The Adequacy of New York\u2019s Required Notice to Judgment Debtor</em></p>\n<p id=\"b670-7\">We turn now to McCahey\u2019s more specific objections to the New York procedures. She argues that the statutorily required Notice to Judgment Debtors, is constitutionally inadequate because it does not apprise the judgment debtor of the specific steps to be taken in order to adjudicate exemption claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-8\">The Notice states: \u201cThe law (New York sections fifty-two hundred, thirty-nine and fifty-two hundred forty) provides a procedure for determination of a claim to an exemption.\u201d McCahey argues that instead of referring the debtor to the relevant statutes, the notice should provide specific information about the time, place, or method for making a motion to perfect the exemption claim and obtain a protective order. Brief of Appellant at 23.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-9\">We are not persuaded even that this additional information would be helpful, much less that it is constitutionally required. Elaborate explanation of the procedures for asserting an exemption may so confuse a layman that he or she may be put off by the complexities and simply allow the seizure. Indeed, McCahey states in her brief that the very notice she challenges as being too sparse was \u201ctoo difficult for her to understand.\u201d Brief of Appellant at 20. A fuller recitation of New York motions practice would hardly clarify matters. The recommendation in capital letters that the debtor contact an attorney or Legal Aid, in combination with notice of the existence of procedures to test claims of exemption, is a sufficient and efficient notice to judgment debtors of their rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>It is true that New York might rewrite this legislation in the hope of simplifying it so laymen might act as their own counsel. This has been attempted in a number of states,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and New York itself provides relatively simple procedures for contesting prejudgment attachments.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"abt-dedup-0\">New York of course <em>could </em>provide simplified procedures for hearing these claims. However, we find no support for the assertion that New York <em>must </em>provide such procedures as a requirement of due process. No matter how laudatory the goal, judicial experience with <em>pro se </em>litigants offers no guarantee that a simplified procedure for use by laymen is better than a more complex procedure used by lawyers. Absent such a guarantee, the requirements of due process do not dictate use of one method rather than another.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-6\">In support of her claim for a more elaborate notice, McCahey relies heavily upon <em>Memphis Light, Gas &amp; Water Division v. Craft, </em>436 U.S. 1, 98 S.Ct. 1554, 56 L.Ed.2d 30 (1978). In that case, the Court ruled that the notice a power company provided customers before it turned off their service was insufficient for purposes of due process. The notice made no mention \u201cof a procedure for the disposition of a disputed claim.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 13, 98 S.Ct. at 1562. The Court went on to state that \u201cnotice is given to thousands of customers of various levels of education, experience, and resources. Lay consumers of electric service, the uninterrupted continuity of which is essential to health and safety, should be informed clearly of the availability of an opportunity to present their complaint. In essence, recipients of a cutoff notice should be told where, during which hours of the day, and before whom disputed bills appropriately may be considered.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 15 n. 15, 98 S.Ct. at 1563 n. 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-12\">We do not believe that <em>Memphis Gas </em>alters our analysis in the present case. First, the Court also stated that a new notice developed by Memphis Gas \u201cmay be entirely adequate.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 15 n. 16, 98 S.Ct. at 1563 n. 16. That notice \u201clists \u2018methods of contact\u2019 and states in part that trained \u2018Credit Counselors are available to clear up any questions, discuss disputed bills or to make any needed adjustments. There are supervisors and other management personnel available if you are not satisfied with the answers or solutions given by the Credit Counselors.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 15 n. 16, 98 S.Ct. at 1563 n. 16. We believe the notice McCahey received is functionally equivalent to the second notice in <em>Memphis Gas.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b671-13\">In addition, there is a difference between the complexity of proving an exemption claim and the complexity of disputing a utility bill. A single company providing a dispute resolution procedure for a single type of dispute is more able to develop simple methods of resolving those disputes than is a state providing procedures to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>enforce its judgments against various sorts of property.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-4\">McCahey also relies on <em>Nelson v. Regan, </em>560 F.Supp. 1101 (D.Conn.1983), <em>aff'd </em>731 F.2d 105 (2d Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 105 S.Ct. 175, 83 L.Ed.2d 110 (1984). That case involved joint taxpayers who were entitled to tax refunds where one of them was also delinquent in child support payments. They successfully claimed that the notice they received from the Internal Revenue Service informing them that their refunds were being seized for the support payments was insufficient because, <em>inter alia, </em>it did not explain how to dispute the seizure. In <em>Nelson, </em>however, there were no regularized procedures for asserting defenses of which notice could be given. <em>Id. </em>at 1106. In the present case, procedures for claiming an exemption exist. Moreover, the child support intercept program affected the second taxpayer, who was not subject to the judgment and who became involved only because of the joint return. Notice that procedures exist to assert exemptions and a recommendation to seek legal counsel thus meet the constitutional standards for post-judgment remedies.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-7\">McCahey next argues the Notice to Judgment Debtors violates due process because its recommendation that the judgment debtor \u201ccontact the person sending this notice\u201d is misleading. She argues that this recommendation leads the debtor into believing that \u201cthe person sending this notice,\u201d usually the attorney for the judgment creditor, will protect the debtor\u2019s rights. She also claims that the notice must state that mere contact with the sender does not necessarily protect exempt property from seizure.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-8\">Although we view McCahey\u2019s assertions as to the behavioral responses of judgment debtors with a degree of skepticism, we also believe that the Notice is misleading only if the initial recommendation is viewed in isolation. That recommendation does not stand alone but is immediately followed by bold type recommending that the debtor contact a lawyer or Legal Aid. We believe this second recommendation eliminates any harmful implications of the prior statement by clearly indicating an alternative course of action if satisfaction is not achieved.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-10\">McCahey stresses that she called Rosen-thal, as the form recommended, and was led by him to believe that he would resolve the dispute. This, she claims, is proof of the constitutional defectiveness of the notice. However, she also followed the recommendation that the judgment debtor contact an attorney or Legal Aid. Her own case, therefore, hardly demonstrates that the form is so poorly drafted as to lead debtors into complete reliance on the creditor\u2019s attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-11\">We further note that recommending contact with the creditor\u2019s attorney is not bad practical advice for many judgment debtors, who may be able to avoid the most painful consequences by working out an agreeable method of satisfaction. We add this observation, not out of any belief in the generosity of collection agencies, but out of recognition that legal processes have costs for them also which may be reduced through negotiation with debtors.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-12\">4. <em>The Requirement of a Prompt Hearing</em></p>\n<p id=\"b672-13\">McCahey argues finally that New York\u2019s post-judgment procedures are defective because they do not guarantee a prompt post-seizure hearing. We agree that due process requires that a judgment debtor be afforded an opportunity for a hearing on an exemption claim within a matter of days. <em>Finberg, </em>634 F.2d at 59; <em>Dionne, </em>757 F.2d at 1353. McCahey has failed to demonstrate that New York does not provide her with that opportunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-14\">It is true that the statutory scheme in question does not provide a mandatory outside time limit on according a hearing on an exemption claim. It is also true that the majority of courts that have squarely addressed the issue has stated that only a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>mandatory period can withstand constitutional scrutiny.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b673-5\">In each of these cases, however, with the exceptions of <em>Dionne </em>and Neeley,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> the judgment debtors had resorted to the state procedures to regain their property before they brought a constitutional challenge in federal court. In each case, moreover, the time that elapsed exceeded what the court decided was the constitutionally permissible maximum. McCahey, on the other hand, made no effort to recover her property by using New York\u2019s procedures. We are therefore not faced with a concrete example of the New York statute in action, and we are unwilling to invalidate a statute because it might, but need not, be applied in an unconstitutional manner.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-6\">The New York statute on its face provides an opportunity for a prompt hearing. The only specific time limit on special proceedings, CPLR \u00a7 5239, and motions, CPLR \u00a7 5240, requires the respondent to be served with the petition or motion papers at least eight days before the hearing. CPLR \u00a7\u00a7 403(b), 2214(b). Both periods, however, may be shortened for cause. CPLR \u00a7\u00a7 403(b), 2214(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b673-7\">It would hardly strain the bounds of statutory construction for New York courts to hold that exemption claims must be heard expeditiously under the New York statutes. Such claims might be treated as presenting \u201ccause\u201d because of due process requirements, and judgment debtors would then have their claims heard within a matter of days. Indeed, in <em>Banks v. Leef, </em>120 Misc.2d 1083, 467 N.Y.S.2d 156 (1983), the judgment debtor was able to obtain an order to show cause with a return date only 10 days after the levy was served on the garnishee, a period of time consistent with most of the caselaw.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-10\">McCahey relies heavily on <em>Barry v. Barchi, </em>443 U.S. 55, 99 S.Ct. 2642, 61 L.Ed.2d 365 (1979), which involved a horse trainer whose horse was discovered to have been drugged during a race and whose license was suspended for 15 days pursuant to New York law. The Court invalidated the statute because it specified no time limit within which a hearing must be held and allowed the board to wait until thirty days after the hearing to issue a final order. Given that loss of the license destroyed the trainer\u2019s livelihood, the Court held that hearings had to be held and concluded \u201cwithout appreciable delay.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 66, 99 S.Ct. at 2650.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-11\">Unlike <em>Barchi, </em>there is no basis in this case to hold that New York post-judgment remedies prevent judgment debtors from having their claims heard \u201cwithout appreciable delay.\u201d CPLR \u00a7 5239 or CPLR \u00a7 5240 do not specify a time period for ruling on exemption claims, but neither do they explicitly give the courts thirty days to delay a ruling. <em>Barchi </em>is therefore not controlling.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-12\">The present case is controlled, or at least informed, by <em>Carey v. Sugar, </em>425 U.S. 73, 96 S.Ct. 1208, 47 L.Ed.2d 587 (1976) <em>(per </em>curiam). That case involved an attack on the constitutionality of New York\u2019s prejudgment attachment statute. The plain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>tiffs contended that the hearing provided on a motion to vacate the attachment was inadequate because the hearing would be concerned only with the question whether the \u201c 'attachment is unnecessary to the security of the plaintiff,\u2019 \u00a7 6223, and would not require the plaintiff to litigate the question of the likelihood that it would ultimately prevail on the merits.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 77, 96 S.Ct. at 1210. The statutory language superficially supported the plaintiffs\u2019 argument in stating: \u201cIf, after the defendant has appeared in the action, the court determines that the attachment is unnecessary to the security of the plaintiff, it shall vacate the order of attachment.\u201d CPLR \u00a7 6223 (McKinney 1980). Nevertheless, the case was remanded because two New York trial courts had held that the statute should not be so narrowly construed. The Court stated: \u201c[i]t would be unwise for this Court to address the constitutionality of the New York attachment statutes, for decision on that issue may be rendered unnecessary by a decision of the New York courts as a matter of state law.\u201d 425 U.S. at 78, 96 S.Ct. at 1210. We think that it would be just as unwise to hold CPLR \u00a7\u00a7 403, 2214 facially unconstitutional because of a lack of a mandatory time limit. We therefore choose to await a concrete example of its application by New York courts to a judgment debtor.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-4\">We have examined McCahey\u2019s other claims and have determined them to be without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-6\">APPENDIX A</p>\n<p id=\"b674-7\">CPLR \u00a7 5222, which governs restraining notices, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b674-8\">(a) <em>Issuance; on whom served; form; service. </em>A restraining notice may be issued by the clerk of the court or the attorney for the judgment creditor as officer of the court.

Connecticut provides a simple procedure for judgment debtors who are natural persons to claim exemptions when their bank accounts are seized. When a bank receives an execution on an account, the bank is required to forward the execution and a simple exemption claim form to the account owner. The debtor has 15 days to return the form to the bank. If the form is returned, the bank forwards the claim to the clerk of the court, who schedules a hearing on the short motion calendar, usually for the following Monday.

While the current form of the notice used in New York for notifying judgment debtors that their property has been seized and that they may contest the seizure of exempt property is an improvement over the postjudgment remedies held constitutionally deficient in <em>Deary v. Guardian Loan Co., </em>534 F.Supp. 1178 (S.D.N.Y.1982), I do not believe the New York legislature has cured all of the constitutional infirmities of the prior notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-14\">As the Supreme Court has stated, \u201c \u2018An elementary and fundamental requirement of due process in any proceeding which is to be accorded finality is notice reasonably calculated, under all the circumstances, to apprise interested parties of the pendency of the action and afford them an opportunity to present their objections.\u2019 \u201d <em>Memphis Light, Gas &amp; Water Division v. Craft, </em>436 U.S. 1, 13, 98 S.Ct. 1554, 1562, 56 L.Ed.2d 30 (1978) (quoting <em>Mullane v. Central Hanover Trust Co., </em>339 U.S. 306, 314, 70 S.Ct. 652, 657, 94 L.Ed. 865 (1950)). In <em>Memphis Light, </em>the Court held that a utility's notification of the termination of utility service did not meet this standard because it failed to advise the customer of the availability of a procedure for protesting the proposed termination. The Court held that utility customers, who were \u201cof various levels of education, experience, and resources,\u201d were constitutionally entitled to \u201cbe informed clearly of the availability of an opportunity to present their complaint.\u201d <em>Id., </em>436 U.S. at 15 n. 15, 98 S.Ct. at 1563 n. 15. The Court specified the minimum notice required by due process as follows: \u201cIn essence, recipients of a cutoff notice should be told where, during which hours of the day, and before whom disputed bills appropriately may be considered.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b678-15\">I agree with the <em>Deary </em>court that the principles stated in <em>Memphis Light </em>are equally applicable in determining the notice to which a New York judgment debtor is constitutionally entitled. Here, as in <em>Memphis Light, </em>the affected individuals are of various levels of education, experience and resources, and should be given notice of both the exemptions to which they may be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"559\">*559</page-number>entitled and the procedures for asserting those exemptions.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-5\">The New York legislature, in amending the prior statutory scheme in light of <em>Deary, </em>has. included in the form of notice only the section nu.mbers of the statutory provisions that govern objections to the seizure of exempt property and has included no disclosure of what those procedures are. In my view, the information thereby given the judgment debtor does not meet the minimum constitutional requirements. I do not find, as does the majority, that the present Notice is substantially the equivalent of a revised form of notice developed by the <em>Memphis Light </em>utility which the Supreme Court thought \u201cmay be entirely adequate.\u201d <em>Memphis Light, </em>436 U.S. at 15 n. 16, 98 S.Ct. at 1563 n. 16. The new notice in <em>Memphis Light </em>actually described \u201cmethods of contact\u201d and stated that trained credit counselors were available \u201cto clear up any questions, discuss disputed bills or to make any needed adjustments.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Thus, the new notice apparently satisfied the Court\u2019s requirement that customers be told before whom disputed bills appropriately might be resolved. By contrast, the New York Notice does not clearly tell judgment debtors the agency from which they are most likely to get relief\u2014 <em>i.e., </em>the state courts. I think it an unreasonable assumption that all judgment debtors, of whatever level of education and experience, will understand the mere reference to two sections of the New York Civil Practice Law and Rules as an instruction that they may go to court and obtain a prompt hearing on their claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-6\">Nor do I view it as sufficient that the Notice indicates that judgment debtors may talk to the person sending the notice or to an attorney of their own. While in some cases contacting the attorney who sent the notice may well be the easiest practical solution, and while we have no desire to multiply proceedings unnecessarily, I believe that a debtor who sees that as the first course of action recommended by the Notice may well be materially misled. The facts of this very case show that the judgment creditor\u2019s attorney simply may disregard advice even from disinterested third parties such as bank officials, and may refuse to wait for promised evidence from the debtor that the property in question is in fact exempt. And although the majority states that McCahey did not rely on this part of the Notice but contacted Legal Aid as well, the record indicates that she apparently did not contact Legal Aid until some <em>2% </em>months after she received the Notice to Judgment Debtor, and then only after her bank had paid the Suffolk County Sheriff the entire balance in her account. Thus, McCahey may well have been misled by the Notice into believing that the first course of action listed \u2014 contacting the person who sent it \u2014 identified the person before whom the disputed claim of exemption might appropriately be resolved.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-8\">In sum, I would hold that the requirements of due process, as set out in <em>Memphis Light, </em>require that, at a minimum, the Notice to Judgment Debtor should tell judgment debtors to what court they should go to seek relief from the seizure, and that the present statement that the debtor may contact the person who sent the notice should be modified to make clear that this is a practical route, not a sure one.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
