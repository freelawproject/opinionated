Tedeschi and Racz point out that their trial was held seven months after their indictment; they add that they were held in custody during this time; and they argue that the seven-month delay violated the Speedy Trial Act\u2019s requirement that the government bring a defendant to trial \u201cwithin seventy days\u201d of indictment. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3161(c)(1). Of course, more than seventy days elapsed between appellants\u2019 indictment (February 1, 1984) and the trial (August 28, 1984). But, appellants concede that many of these days do not count for the purposes of calculating the Act\u2019s \u201cseventy days;\u201d they are excluded by one or another special exclusionary sections contained in the Act. <em>See </em>\u00a7 3161(h). Rather, appellants argue that eighty-six \u201cnon-exeludable\u201d days elapsed between indictment and trial \u2014 sixteen more than the Act allows.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-14\">In evaluating appellants\u2019 claim, we have considered the Act\u2019s provisions excluding, from the \u201cseventy days,\u201d time attributable to certain kinds of pretrial activity. In particular, \u00a7 3161(h)(1) states in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b632-15\">(h) The following periods of delay shall be excluded ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b632-16\">(1) Any period of delay resulting from other proceedings concerning the defendant, including but not limited to\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b632-17\">... (F) delay resulting from any pretrial motion, from the filing of the motion through the conclusion of the hearing on, or other prompt disposition of, such motion;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b632-18\">... (J) delay reasonably attributable to any period, not to exceed thirty days, during which any proceeding concerning the defendant is actually under advisement by the court.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b632-19\">Moreover, in this circuit, as in several others, \u201cpretrial motion\u201d delay under subsection (F) is excludable only if reasonably necessary to the proper disposition of the motion. <em>United States v. Mitchell, </em>723 F.2d 1040, 1047 (1st Cir.1983), <em>accord United States v. Novak, </em>715 F.2d 810, 820 (3d Cir.1983); <em>United States v. Cobb, </em>697 F.2d 38, 44 (2d Cir.1982). After examining the record in light of appellants\u2019 arguments we have concluded that at least sixteen (or more) of the eighty-six days to which appellants point were excludable under these statutory provisions. Appellants therefore received the timely trial that the Speedy Trial Act guarantees them.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-20\">1. The dispositive days at issue run between May 11, 1984 and May 31, 1984\u2014 days during which the district court evaluated appellants\u2019 suppression motions and eventually decided to hold a hearing. The relevant chronology runs as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b633-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>\u2014On February 15, 1984 both defendants filed motions to suppress certain statements.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b633-4\">\u2014On March 22 defendant Racz filed a revised motion seeking to suppress other evidence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b633-5\">\u2014On April 19 the district court held a pretrial conference, agreed to accept Racz\u2019s (late) revised motion, agreed that Tedeschi could file a new substitute suppression motion, and set a briefing schedule.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b633-6\">\u2014On May 10 the government filed the final scheduled brief.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b633-7\">\u2014Between May 11 and May 31 the court considered the parties\u2019 submissions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b633-8\">\u2014By May 31 it concluded that an eviden-tiary hearing would be necessary.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b633-9\">\u2014On August 2 the court held this hearing (a hearing delayed because of what the court later described as \u201cconflicts on the part of both the court and defense counsel.\u201d)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b633-10\">In response to defendants\u2019 speedy trial motions, the district court concluded that for speedy trial purposes it should exclude (from the \u201cseventy days\u201d) the period from February 15 to May 31, but it should not exclude the period between June 1 and August 2 (with a minor exception). The court wrote in its November 21, 1984 Memorandum and Order:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b633-11\">The court rejects the government\u2019s request that the entire time span between February and August be excluded [because of the suppression motions]; the two-and-one-half-month delay in scheduling a hearing following the close of the initial round of briefing on May 10 cannot, in the court\u2019s view be deemed \u201creasonably necessary\u201d under the guidelines of <em>United States v. Mitchell, </em>723 F.2d 1040 (1st Cir.1983). And yet the period from May 11 through May 31, during which time the court was reviewing the suppression issues and at the end of which the court concluded a hearing was necessary, is excludable under section 3161(h)(1)(J).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b633-12\">The dispositive legal issue before us on this appeal is whether the district court properly excluded at least sixteen of these twenty-one days in May.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-14\">2. The first question before us is what subsection of the Act applies: (J), as the district court held, or (F), as appellants now argue? The argument in favor of (J) is a reasonable one: As of May 11, the district court had before it a set of documents and a request for a decision. Viewed <em>ex ante, </em>as of May 11, one could not say whether that decision would take the form of a decision of all, or part, of the motion on the merits, or a decision to seek further information through, for example, a hearing. Why then should one not consider the matter as \u201cunder advisement\u201d within the terms of (J) \u2014 at least until the court decided to schedule further proceedings?</p>\n<p id=\"b633-15\">We find the answer to this question in the fact that, viewed <em>ex post, </em>as of May 31 when the court decided to hold a further proceeding, the <em>entire </em>period fits literally within the language of (F), which speaks of delay \u201cfrom the filing of the motion through the conclusion of the hearing on ... such motion.\u201d We see no unfairness or practical harm caused by viewing the matter <em>ex post, </em>which allows for application of the \u201creasonably necessary\u201d requirement \u2014 a requirement that furthers the basic purposes of the Speedy Trial Act. Hence, we accept the defendants\u2019 view that (F) provides the relevant exclusionary language.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-16\">3. We also conclude, however, that at least sixteen of the twenty-one days in May (eleven working days plus intervening weekends and a holiday) satisfied (F), as interpreted by <em>Mitchell. </em>That is to say, at least this much time was \u201creasonably necessary\u201d to the prompt disposition of the defendants\u2019 suppression motions.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-17\">The particular motions for the district court\u2019s decision at that time included the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b633-18\">1) Racz\u2019s claim that his arrest lacked \u201cprobable cause\u201d \u2014 a claim that he said rested upon a version of the facts set out in the arresting officer\u2019s affidavit.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b634-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>2) Racz\u2019s claim that the arresting officer violated the Fourth Amendment when he seized a red bag that Racz was holding, opened it, and opened a closed bag within it (evidently containing cocaine). <em>See United States v. Chadwick, </em>433 U.S. 1, 97 S.Ct. 2476, 53 L.Ed.2d 538 (1977).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b634-4\">3) Tedeschi\u2019s claim that his waiver of his <em>Miranda </em>rights was involuntary and ineffective because he had drunk two half-pints of gin just before he was arrested. <em>See United States v. Brown, </em>575 F.2d 746 (9th Cir.1978).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b634-5\">4) Tedeschi\u2019s claim that he was illegally arrested because police officers had conducted a warrantless search for him, through the basement of an apartment house, finally arresting him in the apartment of a friend, where he was \u201ctemporarily living.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b634-6\">Racz had filed a fairly detailed factual and legal memorandum in support of his claims; Tedeschi had filed a short memorandum with a few case citations; the government had filed a one-paragraph memorandum in reply simply stating that the appellants\u2019 claims were without legal merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-7\">These motions before the court were complex; not all their claims seemed automatically to call for a hearing; but all called for considerable research. Racz\u2019s \u201cunlawful bag seizure\u201d claim, for example, raised a difficult legal question (can an arresting officer make a warrantless search of a bag within an accompanying bag?, <em>see United States v. Chadwick, supra), </em>but it did not suggest any factual dispute. The court reasonably might have wanted to research this issue, the \u201cpint of gin/voluntary waiver\u201d issue, and \u201cwarrant-less search\u201d law as applied to apartment houses; it reasonably might have wanted to review the government\u2019s version of the facts; and it reasonably might have wanted to reexamine the motions in light of its research results \u2014 all before deciding whether to hold an evidentiary hearing as to some or all of defendants\u2019 claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-9\">This type of research takes time. Moreover, the judge cannot devote every full working day to the claims of a single criminal defendant, for he must decide motions in other criminal cases or preside at other criminal trials \u2014 all involving defendants, each of whom is entitled to a \u201cspeedy trial.\u201d (In a month, a Massachusetts district judge maintains a criminal docket of fifteen to twenty cases, involving twenty-five to thirty defendants, along with a civil docket of five hundred or so civil cases.) An appellate court must leave district judges considerable leeway in respect to scheduling and working manner, lest too single-minded a pursuit of one desirable object, namely speed, interfere with the attainment of other equally important elements of a fair and effective system of criminal justice, such as thorough research and careful thought. For these reasons, we find \u201creasonable\u201d (and hence excludable) at least the sixteen days taken in determining that an eviden-tiary hearing would be necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-11\">4. Appellants make three additional arguments. First, they suggest.that the district court failed to supply a \u201creasonably contemporaneous\u201d statement of reasons for the February to August delay. <em>Mitchell </em>holds:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b634-12\">In order to make this \u201creasonably necessary\u201d time rule susceptible of meaningful appellate review, we invoke our supervisory power to direct that henceforth district courts make specific and reasonably contemporaneous statements of the reasons for any extended exclusions of time between filing and hearing or submission of pretrial motions.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b634-13\"><em>United States v. Mitchell, </em>723 F.2d at 1047. The record shows that, while Tedes-chi moved for a speedy trial dismissal on June 6, that motion seemed to rest upon the theory that the (h) exclusions did not apply to an incarcerated person; thus it did not focus the court\u2019s attention upon the reasons for the suppression motion delays. The first motion actually to call the court\u2019s attention to the various February to August suppression motion delays was filed by Racz on August 20. The district court received the government\u2019s opposition on August 24 and held a hearing on August <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>28. The court denied the motion on August 28. It stated its reasons in an opinion released on November 21.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-5\">The delay between the time of decision, August 28, and the filing of a memorandum of reasons, on November 21, is a long one. In our view, it violated Mitchell\u2019s \u201creasonably contemporaneous statement\u201d requirement. This is not to say that a district court need always file a detailed opinion immediately upon deciding a Speedy Trial Act question. But, even a brief oral statement by the court when it decided defendants\u2019 motion on August 28 or soon thereafter would have helped to guarantee that its evaluation of the reasons for excluding challenged days took place while the periods in question were relatively fresh in the judge\u2019s mind.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-6\">Our finding of a failure to satisfy one of Mitchell\u2019,s \u201csupervisory power\u201d requirements does not help appellants, however, for we do not believe that dismissal of the indictment is an appropriate remedy in this case. For one thing, the court\u2019s failure to file \u201ccontemporaneous\u201d reasons did not significantly prejudice them. The district court focused upon the reasons for the \u201csuppression motion\u201d delay by late August fairly soon after the delay ended on August 2, soon after the delay threatened to cause a Speedy Trial Act violation and almost immediately after defendants called it specifically to the court\u2019s attention on August 20. The court reached a decision within a few days, while the facts were still fresh in the judge\u2019s mind. We have also evaluated the record independently, and have concluded that enough of the delay at issue was reasonable to have made trial timely. Thus, defendants, in our view, received the speedy trial that the Act guarantees them. For another thing, we find the district court\u2019s failure to make reasonably contemporaneous findings peculiarly excusable in the context of this case. The district court, not unreasonably, presumed that until May 31 it was working under the (J) \u201cunder advisement\u201d exclusion which under our caselaw requires no such findings. While we have determined that the district court erred in this particular, the fact that this court has not previously elaborated upon the meaning of the \u201creasonably contemporaneous\u201d requirement and the respective domains of (F) and (J) exclusions leads us to conclude that the district court\u2019s departure is not so egregious as somehow to call for reversal especially where there was no significant harm or prejudice to defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-8\">Second, appellants argue that the district court erred in not setting a trial date until August 2, 1984, though they had been indicted on February 1, 1984. They argue this is a violation \u00f3f \u00a7 3161(a) which states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b635-9\">In any case involving a defendant charged with an offense, the appropriate judicial officer, at the <em>earliest practicable time, </em>shall, after consultation with the counsel for the defendant and the attorney for the Government, set the case for trial on a day certain, or list it for trial on a weekly or other short-term calendar at a place within the judicial district, so as to assure a speedy trial.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AI6\">(Emphasis added.) Appellants claim that the violation of this command requires that the indictments be dismissed. Setting a trial date at the earliest practical time is the best method for assuring a speedy trial; it concentrates the focus of the parties and the court onto the target that counts, the start of trial. Failure to set a trial date as soon as practicable with a cut off date for motions inevitably results in the court being inundated with a continuous stream of motions. This provision of the Speedy Trial Act, however, is hortatory only. The Act\u2019s dismissal sanction is limited to violations of the seventy-day pretrial limit. It says:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b635-10\">If a defendant is not brought to trial within the time limit required by section 3161(c) as extended by section 3161(h), the information or indictment shall be dismissed on motion of the defendant.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AkpH\">\u00a7 3162(a)(2). The Act provides no specific sanction for a violation of its \u201cearliest practicable\u201d time requirement. And, we therefore find no legal basis for ordering dismissal of the indictment in a case like this one.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>Third, appellants challenge the district court\u2019s refusal to give them access to the \u201cdetention supervision reports\u201d required to be filed biweekly by the government concerning each defendant in custody for more than ten days containing a \u201cstatement of the reasons why the defendant is still held in custody.\u201d Fed.R.Crim.P. 46(g). Appellants appear to want these reports because they believe that they may contain some information about the reasons for the pretrial delay and because they wish to prove inaccurate the district court\u2019s statement in the Speedy Trial Act memorandum that the delay during the period from May 11 to August 2 was caused by \u201cconflicts on the part of both the court and defense counsel.\u201d We find nothing erroneous about the district court\u2019s decision not to release these reports to correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-4\">Since we have found that at least sixteen of the crucial twenty-one days in May 1984 were properly excluded from the speedy trial computation under \u00a7 3161(h)(1)(F) as a period reasonably necessary to the proper disposition of a pretrial motion before hearing, there are, by appellants\u2019 own figures no more than 70 non-excludable days. Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is</p>\n<p id=\"b636-5\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
