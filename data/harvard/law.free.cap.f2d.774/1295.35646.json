In affirming the district court, we strike the constitutional balance in favor of the employee.</p>\n<p id=\"b1417-15\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1417-16\">Plaintiff Edgardo Gonzalez was Executive Director of the Laredo-Webb County Community Action Agency (CAA). The CAA administers a variety of federally funded anti-poverty programs in Webb County, Texas. Congress created community action agencies to involve local residents, including representatives of the poor and business and civic leaders, in developing and carrying out policies to reduce poverty. <em>See </em>H.Rep. No. 1458, 88th Cong. 2nd Sess., <em>reprinted in </em>1964 U.S. Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News 2900, 2945. In 1967, Congress amended the Economic Opportunity Act to create a larger role for local elected officials. <em>See </em>H.Rep. No. 866, 90th Cong. 1st Sess., <em>reprinted in </em>1967 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News 2428, 2448-49. The 1967 amendments permit states or political subdivisions of states to designate themselves as community action agencies. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2790(a). If the state or political subdivision does so, it must create an \u201cAdministering Board\u201d composed of equal numbers of representatives of the poor, representatives from \u201cmajor groups and interests in the community\u201d, and elected officials. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2791(b). The Webb County Commissioners\u2019 Court designated itself as the community action agency for Webb County. The commissioners created an Administering Board of 21 persons and approved a set of regulations to govern the operations of the CAA. The Commissioners\u2019 Court appointed the senior staff of the CAA, including the Executive Director and the Deputy Director. The commissioners also reviewed policies, plans, and regulations developed by the staff and the Administering Board, and ratified the minutes of Administering Board meetings. The Administering Board oversaw CAA planning and administration. We accept the district <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1298\">*1298</page-number>court\u2019s finding that the Administering Board \u201cwas clearly charged with the day-to-day supervision of Gonzalez and explicitly directed to evaluate his job performance.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1418-4\">Gonzalez began working for the predecessor of the CAA, the Webb County Economic Opportunities Development Corporation, in 1969. He became Executive Director of the CAA in March 1979. In May of 1980, Gonzalez discharged the Deputy Director of the CAA, Oscar Chavez. The County Commissioners\u2019 Court reinstated Chavez, publicly reprimanded Gonzalez for exceeding his authority, and began an investigation of Gonzalez\u2019s job performance.</p>\n<p id=\"b1418-5\">Gonzalez appeared before the Commissioners\u2019 Court and stated publicly that the investigation violated CAA regulations. During a lengthy closed session following his public statement, Gonzalez maintained that he was specifically authorized to dismiss any employee under a regulation approved by the commissioners.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Gonzalez apparently did not contest the commissioners\u2019 power to reinstate the Deputy Director. Instead, he objected that Chavez had not appealed first to the Administering Board, as required by the regulations.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Gonzalez conceded that the Commissioners\u2019 Court had the power to fire him with or without cause.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> He insisted, however, that the regulations deprived the Commissioners\u2019 Court of authority to evaluate the Executive Director\u2019s job performance.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The commissioners argued that their power to fire Gonzalez necessarily included the power to evaluate him. They demanded that Gonzalez publicly acknowledge their authority to evaluate his performance.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Gonzalez refused, and the commissioners fired him.</p>\n<p id=\"b1418-13\">Gonzalez brought suit under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, contending that his termination was an unconstitutional retaliation for protected speech and a violation of protected liberty and property interests. The district court rejected the due process claims, but concluded that Gonzalez\u2019s statements were protected by the First Amendment and awarded damages.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Employees may recover for actions taken by government employers in retaliation for protected speech even if the employee has no protected liberty or property interest in his job. <em>Mount Healthy City Board of Education v. Doyle, </em>1977, 429 U.S. 274, 283-84, 97 S.Ct. 568, 574-75, 50 L.Ed.2d 471.</p>\n<p id=\"b1419-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1299\">*1299</page-number>On appeal, we observed that Gonzalez apparently had wide discretion to carry out or subvert the policies of elected officials, and remanded so that the district court could determine whether the Executive Director\u2019s relationship with the Commissioners\u2019 Court fell \u201cinto that narrow band of fragile relationships requiring for job security loyalty at the expense of unfettered speech\". <em>Gonzalez I, </em>712 F.2d at 150. We remanded the case to the district court to determine whether such a fragile relationship existed and if so, whether Gonzalez\u2019s speech undermined the relationship.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1419-5\">In an unpublished opinion, the district court found that Gonzalez occupied a sensitive policymaking position, but concluded that his speech was protected because it caused no significant harm to his relationship with the commissioners.</p>\n<p id=\"b1419-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1419-7\">The Supreme Court has rejected the sweeping proposition that public employees may be required to surrender First Amendment rights as a condition of employment. <em>See Keyeshian v. Board of Regents, </em>1967, 385 U.S. 589, 605-06, 87 S.Ct. 675, 684-85, 17 L.Ed.2d 629. Shortly after it handed down the <em>Keyeshian </em>opinion, the Court concluded that government employees are not always free to speak as private citizens. <em>Pickering v. Board of Education, </em>1968, 391 U.S. 563, 88 S.Ct. 1731, 20 L.Ed.2d 811. The balancing test announced in <em>Pickering, </em>although simply stated, is often difficult and uncertain of application. <em>Pickering </em>instructs us to strike \u201ca balance between the interests of the [employee], as a citizen, in commenting upon matters of public concern and the interest of the [government], as an employer, in promoting the efficiency of the public services it performs through its employees.\u201d 391 U.S. at 568, 88 S.Ct. at 1734. The <em>Pickering </em>Court suggested some factors to be weighed in the balance: whether the statements were directed against persons with whom the speaker \u201cwould normally be in contact in the course of his daily work\u201d; whether they had an adverse effect on \u201cdiscipline by immediate superiors or harmony among coworkers\u201d; whether \u201cit can persuasively be claimed that personal loyalty and confidence are necessary\u201d to a successful employment relationship; whether the employee\u2019s statements \u201ceither impeded [the] proper performance of his daily duties ... or ... interfered with the address operation of the [agency]\u201d; and whether the statements addressed a matter of public concern. <em>Id. </em>at 568-73, 88 S.Ct. at 1734-37.</p>\n<p id=\"b1419-11\">The Court refined the <em>Pickering </em>analysis in <em>Connick v. Myers, </em>1983, 461 U.S. 138, 103 S.Ct. 1684, 75 L.Ed.2d 708. Under <em>Connick, </em>the employee\u2019s speech is entitled to judicial protection only if it addresses a matter of public concern. The Court reasoned that \u201cspeech concerning public affairs\u201d is entitled to greater judicial protection because it \u201cis more than self-expression; it is the essence of self-government\u201d. <em>Connick, </em>461 U.S. at 145, 103 S.Ct. at 1689, <em>quoting Garrison v. Louisiana, </em>1964, 379 U.S. 64, 74-75, 85 S.Ct. 209, 215-16, 13 L.Ed.2d 125. Public employees, by virtue of their public employment, may make valuable contributions to the public debate. <em>See Pickering, </em>391 U.S. at 572, 88 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1300\">*1300</page-number>S.Ct. at 1736-37. The majority in <em>Connick </em>held that, if the employee commented on matters of only personal interest, the employee\u2019s discharge is not subject to First Amendment review \u201cabsent the most unusual circumstances\u201d. 461 U.S. at 147, 103 S.Ct. at 1690. Employee speech, even on issues of public concern, must be balanced against the government\u2019s interest in \u201cpromoting] efficiency and integrity in the discharge of official duties\u201d and in \u201cmaintainpng] proper discipline in the public service\u201d. <em>Connick, </em>461 U.S. at 150-51, 103 S.Ct. at 1692, <em>quoting Ex parte Curtis, </em>1882, 106 U.S. 371, 373, 1 S.Ct. 381, 383-84, 27 L.Ed. 232. The <em>Connick </em>Court considered whether the employee\u2019s speech impeded her ability to carry out her job; whether close working relationships with superiors were disrupted; and the time, place, and manner of the speech. 461 U.S. at 151-53, 103 S.Ct. at 1692-93.</p>\n<p id=\"b1420-4\">Both <em>Connick </em>and <em>Pickering </em>emphasize that the Supreme Court\u2019s enumeration of factors to weigh in the balance is not exhaustive. <em>See </em>461 U.S. at 153, 103 S.Ct. at 1693; 391 U.S. at 569, 88 S.Ct. at 1735. When we first considered this case, we identified an additional factor that may limit the employee\u2019s right to speak freely. We noted that senior government employees who exercise broad discretionary authority may be able to \u201cmake or break\u201d the programs and policies of elected officials. <em>Gonzalez I, </em>712 F.2d at 149. We analogized the interest at stake to the government\u2019s interest in the party affiliation of some employees. <em>Id. </em>at 147-49. <em>Cf. Branti v. Finkel, </em>1980, 445 U.S. 507, 100 S.Ct. 1287, 63 L.Ed.2d 574; <em>Elrod v. Burns, </em>1976, 427 U.S. 347, 96 S.Ct. 2673, 49 L.Ed.2d 547.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> We concluded that the speech rights of such employees might have to be curtailed to safeguard the political process.</p>\n<p id=\"b1420-7\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b1420-8\">We now apply the <em>Pickering-Con-nick </em>scheme to the Gonzalez case. Although this Court will not disturb the district court\u2019s findings of fact unless they are clearly erroneous, we must weigh the facts for ourselves to arrive at an \u201cindependent constitutional judgment\u201d. <em>See Connick, </em>461 U.S. at 150 n. 10, 103 S.Ct. at 1692 n. 10, <em>quoting Jacobellis v. Ohio, </em>1964, 378 U.S. 184, 190, 88 S.Ct. 1676, 1679, 12 L.Ed.2d 793 (opinion of Brennan, J.).</p>\n<p id=\"b1420-9\">The defendants concede that Gonzalez was fired because of his speech. The plaintiff therefore satisfies the causation requirement established in <em>Mount Healthy City Board of Education v. Doyle, </em>1977, 429 U.S. 274, 97 S.Ct. 568, 50 L.Ed.2d 471.</p>\n<p id=\"b1420-10\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b1420-11\">Whether Gonzalez commented upon matters of public concern \u201cmust be determined by the content, form, and context of a given statement, as revealed by the whole record\u201d. <em>Connick, </em>461 U.S. at 147-48, 103 S.Ct. at 1690-1691.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> We are mindful of <em>Connick's </em>admonition that not every conflict between public servants should be elevated to an issue of public concern. <em>Id. </em>at 149, 103 S.Ct. at 1691. Gonzalez\u2019s disagreement with the commissioners indisputably was a matter of concern to Gonzalez as an employee. We do not read <em>Connick, </em>however, to exclude the possibility that an issue of private concern <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1301\">*1301</page-number>to the employee may also be an issue of public concern. Indeed, the teacher dress code at issue in <em>Mount Healthy, </em>and the school bonds under discussion in <em>Pickering, </em>appear to have been \u201cmixed\u201d issues of both public and private concern. <em>See The Supreme Court, 1982 Term, </em>97 Harv.L.Rev. 70, 171 (1984). We are persuaded that Gonzalez raised such a mixed issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b1421-5\">First, Gonzalez raised the possibility that violations of CAA regulations would result in a loss of federal funds for poverty programs in Webb County.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Federal policy favors ensuring that representatives of the poor participate in policymaking. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2791(b). The direct intervention of the county commissioners contravened this policy. Although the Administering Board ratified the action of the Commissioners\u2019 Court by a vote of eight to seven, the result might have been different if the Board had been consulted before the commissioners acted. Had federal funding been cut off, thousands of needy Webb County residents would have lost over a million dollars a year in federal assistance. While such a catastrophe may have been unlikely, we believe the importance of the programs at stake raised the issue to a matter of significant public concern.</p>\n<p id=\"b1421-6\">Second, whether the Commissioners\u2019 Court complied with CAA regulations is a question of public concern. The regulations relied on by Gonzalez were ratified by the County Court itself. While Gonzalez\u2019s reading of the regulations is not indisputably correct, he raised legitimate questions of interpretation. We consider that compliance with the regulations by the Commissioners\u2019 Court is a matter of significant public concern.</p>\n<p id=\"b1421-8\">Third, the uncertain allocation of authority and responsibility among the County Court, the CAA\u2019s Administering Board, the Executive Director, and the Deputy Director was a matter of public concern. That uncertainty resulted in this expensive and time-consuming lawsuit. Even before Gonzalez fired his deputy, this uncertainty generated friction and reduced the efficiency of the agency.</p>\n<p id=\"b1421-9\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b1421-10\">Because we agree with the district court\u2019s conclusion that Gonzalez\u2019s speech raised issues of significant public concern, we next consider the government interest at stake.</p>\n<p id=\"b1421-11\">In <em>Connick, </em>the Court found that a close working relationship with superiors was essential to the employee\u2019s job. 461 U.S. at 152, 103 S.Ct. at 1693. This case is different. The district court found that Gonzalez\u2019s job did not require frequent meetings with the Commissioners\u2019 Court. The Administering Board monitored the performance of Gonzalez and his staff; the Commissioners\u2019 Court generally limited its involvement to ratifying the minutes of Administering Board meetings.</p>\n<p id=\"b1421-12\">We noted, however, that a senior executive employee might be required to curtail his speech even though that employee does not have a close working relationship with elected officials. <em>Gonzalez I, </em>712 F.2d at 148. We asked the trial judge to consider whether Gonzalez\u2019s relationship to the Commissioners\u2019 Court was particularly fragile because Gonzalez was in a position to frustrate policies on which the commissioners may have based their election campaigns. <em>Id. </em>at 149-50. The district court found that Gonzalez occupied a \u201cpolicymak-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1302\">*1302</page-number>ing\u201d position giving rise to such a fragile relationship.</p>\n<p id=\"b1422-4\">. [13] In considering party affiliation as a qualification for public employment, the Supreme Court has concluded that the \u201cpol-icymaking\u201d label is not always decisive. <em>Branti v. Finkel, </em>1980, 445 U.S. 507, 518, 100 S.Ct. 1287,1294-95, 63 L.Ed.2d 574. In this instance, we think that the policymak-ing nature of Gonzalez\u2019s position is highly relevant to the question whether he could defeat the political program of elected officials. Gonzalez exercised broad discretion over the whole range of CAA programs. Although the evidence suggests that CAA policies often were developed by the Administering Board rather than the Commissioners\u2019 Court, CAA programs were a crucial political concern of the county commissioners.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> We will not disturb the district court\u2019s finding on this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b1422-5\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b1422-6\">Finally, we must weigh the government\u2019s interest in the loyalty of a key executive employee against the employee\u2019s speech rights. \u201cThat weighing is required because we do not decide that all speech by persons in such relationships is unprotected. Rather, the speech must be weighed against its impact upon the relationship and that relationship\u2019s role in the elected official\u2019s discharge of his duties.\u201d <em>Gonzalez I, </em>712 F.2d at 150.</p>\n<p id=\"b1422-7\">\u201c[T]he [government\u2019s] burden in justifying a particular discharge varies depending upon the nature of the employee\u2019s expression.\u201d <em>Connick, </em>461 U.S. at 150, 103 S.Ct. at 1691-92. In <em>Connick, </em>the Court held that the public employer was justified in dismissing the employee because the employer reasonably believed the employee\u2019s speech was likely to disrupt its operations. 461 U.S. at 152, 103 S.Ct. at 1693. The majority carefully noted, however, that a stronger showing of disruption may be necessary if the employee\u2019s speech more substantially involves matters of public concern. <em>Id. </em>We have concluded that Gonzalez directly addressed matters of substantial public concern. We conclude, moreover, that the defendants have not made even the lesser showing required in <em>Connick.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1422-10\">The defendants offered no evidence to show that Gonzalez\u2019s speech was likely to undermine the commissioners\u2019 political program. Gonzalez\u2019s refusal to acquiesce posed no immediate threat to the operation of the CAA. Gonzalez did not refuse to carry out the County Commissioners\u2019 directives so long as they were consistent with CAA regulations. The district court found that there was \u201cabsolutely no evidence or contention that Gonzalez refused to abide by\u201d the commissioners\u2019 decision. He offered to help amend the regulations to suit the commissioners. There is no suggestion that the commissioners\u2019 policies were in such imminent danger that there was no time to amend the procedures to settle the dispute.</p>\n<p id=\"b1422-11\">Gonzalez did not challenge the commissioners\u2019 power to fire him. He did not deny that the Commissioners had authority to reinstate Deputy Director Chavez; Gonzalez merely insisted that he had the authority to fire Chavez in the first place, and that Chavez should have followed regulations by appealing to the Administering Board. Gonzalez did not attempt to obstruct the commissioners\u2019 investigation; he merely protested that the commissioners were violating agency regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b1422-12\">The defendants argue that Gonzalez\u2019s refusal to acquiesce was a challenge to their authority. That argument begs the question. If the commissioners acted contrary to CAA procedures, as Gonzalez maintains, they exceeded the authority allocated to them by regulations the Commissioners\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1303\">*1303</page-number>Court itself had approved. Gonzalez merely stated that, in his opinion, the commissioners were acting <em>ultra vires.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1423-5\">Following his public statement, Gonzalez spoke in closed session. His speech retains its protected status. <em>See Givhan v. Western Line Consolidated School District, </em>1979, 439 U.S. 410, 99 S.Ct. 693, 58 L.Ed.2d 619. \u201cWhen a government employee personally confronts his immediate superior, the employing agency\u2019s institutional efficiency may be threatened not only by the content of the employee\u2019s message, but also by the manner, time, and place in which it is delivered.\u201d <em>Id. </em>439 U.S. at 439 n. 4, 99 S.Ct. at 701 n. 4. We agree with the district court\u2019s conclusion that \u201cthere was nothing about the manner, time or place of Gonzalez\u2019s statement that would justify his dismissal\u201d. Gonzalez was polite throughout his exchanges with the Commissioners\u2019 Court. He did not launch personal attacks on the commissioners. At several points he offered to cooperate in amending the CAA procedures to meet the commissioners\u2019 wishes. As the district court found, Gonzalez\u2019s conduct could not be characterized as a \u201cmini-insurrection\u201d. <em>Cf. Connick, </em>461 U.S. at 141, 103 S.Ct. at 1687. The time and place were selected by the commissioners, who began their investigation with little warning to Gonzalez.</p>\n<p id=\"b1423-6\">The district court found that Gonzalez\u2019s loyalties were divided. On the one hand, he served at the pleasure of the Commissioners\u2019 Court, which sought direct control over the CAA. On the other hand, Gonzalez was obliged to carry out federal policies designed to remove the CAA from local political influence. This conflict accurately describes Gonzalez\u2019s predicament. It is pertinent, but we need not rely on this finding because we conclude that Gonzalez\u2019s speech was entitled to First Amendment protection even if the Commissioners\u2019 Court is viewed as the sole government employer.</p>\n<p id=\"b1423-16\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b1423-17\">Our discussion suggests the familiar disadvantages of case-by-case balancing of First Amendment rights. Examination of the facts is difficult and time-consuming. In many cases judges are free to decide the case on a hunch. Because of this unpredictability, individualized balancing inevitably chills some protected speech even as it discourages government officials from acting vigorously against some unprotected speech. <em>See </em>T. Emerson, <em>Toward a General Theory of the First Amendment. </em>72 Yale L.J. 877, 913-14 (1962). Nevertheless, because public employees speak in a great variety of circumstances, individualized balancing seems preferable to a predictable but inflexible categorical approach. And in the context of such cases great reliance should be placed on the judicial discretion exercised by the trial judge in the fact-finding process. Here, on remand the trial judge faithfully followed the clear but demanding mandate of <em>Gonzalez I.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1423-8\">For the reasons we have discussed, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1417-17\">. <em>See Gonzalez v. Benavides, </em>5 Cir.1983, 712 F.2d 142 <em>(Gonzalez </em>I).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1418-6\">. Gonzalez relied on a CAA regulation providing, in part: \"Any employee may be dismissed by the Executive Director ... for cause\". <em>Policies and Procedures, Laredo-Webb County Community Action Agency </em>ch. XVI \u00a7 7.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1418-7\">. Gonzalez maintained that Chavez was obliged to follow the CAA\u2019s personnel grievance procedure. That procedure calls for an appeal in writing to the Administering Board. <em>Id. </em>ch. XVII \u00a7 3(3).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1418-8\">. Our impression in the earlier case that Gonzalez \"den[ied] the core authority of the commissioners to fire him\u201d, <em>Gonzalez I, </em>712 F.2d at 146, was mistaken. The district court so found. Indeed, another CAA regulation states that the Executive Director serves at the pleasure of the Commissioners' Court. <em>See Policies and Procedures, Laredo-Webb County Community Action Agency </em>ch. XIX \u00a7 1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1418-9\">. Gonzalez cited a regulation providing that \u2018[t]he performance evaluation of the Executive Director shall be made by the Administering Board.\u201d <em>Id. </em>ch. XII \u00a7 1. He maintained that the wording of the regulation precludes evaluation by any other body.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b1418-15\">. The defendants suggest that the commissioners merely asked Gonzalez to recognize that their view differed from his. The district court, however, found that the commissioners required Gonzalez to accept their view. Our reading of the record supports the district court\u2019s finding. Gonzalez was unlikely to have risked his job simply to deny that the commissioners actually held the view they purported to hold.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b1418-16\">.

Staunton, </em>7 Cir.1972, 471 F.2d 475, 482, <em>cert. denied </em>410 U.S. 955, 93 S.Ct. 1419, 35 L.Ed.2d 687 (1973). Gonzalez, however, has found another job at a slightly lower salary, while the County Court has hired a new Executive Director. The parties therefore agree that Gonzalez should recover only lost income and attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b1419-8\">. We said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1419-9\">On remand the trial court is free to take additional evidence. It should first decide from the facts whether in Gonzalez's relationship with the county commissioners his true position and power were such as to implicate the governmental interest we describe. If such an interest is implicated the trial court should then weigh that interest against the asserted rights of free speech. That weighing is required because we do not decide that all speech by persons in such relationships is unprotected. Rather, the speech must be weighed against its impact upon the relationship and that relationship\u2019s role in the elected official\u2019s discharge of his duties.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1419-13\">In this weighing one must look at what was said. We are wary of reviewing content in an <em>a priori </em>inquiry into entitlement to protection but that does not mean that content is irrelevant to the balancing exercise. In <em>Connick </em>the Court analyzed the nature of the asserted speech in determining its relevance to public issues. We require that here. The able trial judge has approached this case in a sensitive and thoughtful manner. We are reluctant to ask him to continue that effort, but we must do so. 712 F.2d at 150.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b1420-5\">. Our analogy does not conflate the categorical approach of the political affiliation cases with the individualized balancing required in employee speech cases. We simply identified an additional government interest to be weighed in the balance. This court has since viewed employee speech and employee party affiliation as endpoints on a single continuum. <em>See McBee v. Jim Hogg County, </em>5 Cir.1984, 730 F.2d 1009 (en banc). <em>McBee </em>is unnecessary to our analysis here.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b1420-12\">. The dissenters in <em>Connick </em>object that the majority\u2019s formulation weighs \u201ccontext\" twice, first to determine whether the speech addressed an issue of public concern, and then to balance the interests of speaker and government. 461 U.S. at 159-61, 103 S.Ct. at 1696-97. We do not see the force of this objection. Case-by-case adjudication requires consideration of \"the whole record\u201d, including the \"context\" of the speech, to determine whether the speaker addressed an issue of actual, as opposed to merely potential, public concern.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b1421-7\">. In 1969, the Office of Economic Opportunity (superseded by the Community Services Administration in 1974) issued a memorandum stating that any community action agency failing to comply with the requirements of the statutes risked loss of federal funding. The memorandum stated that persistent failure to consult the Administering Board might result in loss of funding. Community Action Memorandum No. 81 at 8. A 1979 \"instruction\u201d from the Community Services Agency requires that the Administering Board must participate in the selection of the Executive Director. CSA Instruction 6400-01a. Gonzalez neglected to tell the Commissioners\u2019 Court about the more recent regulation before his final interview with them. We do not think Gonzalez\u2019s failure, however culpable, decreases the public importance of the issue he raised. Moreover, the earlier memorandum raised the possibility that failure to consult the Administering Board would result in a loss of funds.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b1422-8\">. Our analysis suggests that the Executive Director might have been dismissed because of his party affiliation under <em>Elrod </em>and <em>Branti. </em>We need not, and do not, express an opinion on this question. We note, however, that Congress has expressed a preference for insulating community action agencies from some local political pressures, and that the Community Services Administration now requires Administering Board participation in the selection, if not the dismissal, of the Executive Director.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
