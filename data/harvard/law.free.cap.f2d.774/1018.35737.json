MOORE, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b1139-12\">This appeal presents the question of whether the assessment provisions of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3013 (1984) are applicable to assimilated crimes. We hold they are not in this case. The defendant here pled guilty to two counts of an information charging him with breaking and entering a dwelling on Kirtland Air Force Base in violation of N.M.Stat.Ann. \u00a7 30-14-8 (1978) and the As-similative Crimes Act, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 13. Because the offenses occurred after the effective date of the Comprehensive Crime Control Act of 1984, October 12, 1984, the district court imposed two $50 special assessments under \u00a7 1405(a) of that Act. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3013.</p>\n<p id=\"b1139-15\">On appeal defendant argues that the district court erred in imposing the special assessments against him. First, defendant asserts that the special assessment provision is not applicable to offenses committed under the Assimilative Crimes Act. Second, defendant contends that even if the special assessment provision is applicable, only one assessment can be imposed on a defendant regardless of the number of offenses to which he is convicted. We reverse the judgment of the district court applying the special assessment provisions imposed under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3013; consequently, we do not reach the second question.</p>\n<p id=\"b1139-16\">Section 1405(a) of the Comprehensive Crime Control Act of 1984 amended title 18 by adding section 3013. Section 3013 is entitled \u201cSpecial assessment on convicted persons.\u201d The section in full reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1139-17\">(a) The court shall assess on any person convicted of an offense against the United States\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1139-18\">(1) in the case of a misdemeanor\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1139-19\">(A) the amount of $25 if the defendant is an individual; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1139-20\">(B) the amount of $100 if the defendant is a person other than an individual; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1139-21\">(2) in the case of a felony\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1139-22\">(A) the amount of $50 if the defendant is an individual; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1139-23\">(B) the amount of $200 if the defendant is a person other than an individual.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1139-24\">(b) Such amount so assessed shall be collected in the manner that fines are collected in criminal cases.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1139-25\">18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3013. The stated purpose of the special assessment provision is to generate income to offset the cost of a newly created victim\u2019s assistance fund. S.Rep. No. 497, 98th Cong., 2d Sess. 13, <em>reprinted </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1020\">*1020</page-number><em>in </em>1984 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News 3182, 3607, 3619.</p>\n<p id=\"b1140-4\">The Assimilative Crimes Act, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 13, states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1140-5\">Whoever within or upon any of the places now existing or hereafter reserved or acquired as provided in section 7 of this title, is guilty of any act or omission which, although not made punishable by any enactment of Congress, would be punishable if committed or omitted within the jurisdiction of the State, Territory, Possession, or District in which such place is situated, by the laws thereof in force at the time of such act or omission, shall be guilty of a like offense <em>and subject to a like punishment.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1140-6\">(Emphasis added.) The purpose of this Act is to conform the criminal law of federal enclaves to that of local law except in cases of specific federal crimes. <em>United States v. Best, </em>573 F.2d 1095 (9th Cir.1978). Essentially, the Act fills gaps in the federal law by providing a set of criminal laws for federal reservations. <em>United States v. Prejean, </em>494 F.2d 495, 496 (5th Cir.1974). Since there is no express enactment of Congress providing punishment for breaking and entering, the Assimilative Crimes Act and New Mexico law were appropriately applied in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1140-7\">The question we now face, whether the penalty assessment applies to assimilative crimes, has not yet been considered. As we view the problem, it is one of statutory construction. The assessment, by its terms, applies to \u201cany person convicted of an offense against the United States.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3013. Clearly, persons convicted of assimilative crimes have been \u201cconvicted of an offense against the United States.\u201d This does not mean, however, that the assessment necessarily applies to assimilative crimes. Dependent upon the laws of the forum state, the terms of the Assimilative Crimes Act may preclude this result in some cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b1140-8\">The Assimilative Crimes Act makes clear that an individual who commits an act on a federal reservation which is illegal under the laws of the state where the enclave is located \u201cshall be guilty of a like offense <em>and subject to a like punishment\u201d </em>under the federal law. (Emphasis added.) This language has consistently been construed to require punishment only in the way and to the extent that the same offense would have been punishable if the territory embraced by the federal reservation or enclave where the crime was committed remained subject to the jurisdiction of the state. <em>United States v. Press Publishing Co., </em>219 U.S. 1, 31 S.Ct. 212, 55 L.Ed. 65 (1911); <em>United States v. Dunn, </em>545 F.2d 1281 (10th Cir.1976). Thus, if the special assessment is found to be a punishment, and New Mexico has no similar punishment, imposition of the assessment <em>in this case, </em>would be violative of the Assimilative Crimes Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b1140-10\">Because the parties agree that New Mexico has no similar provision for collecting special assessments from convicted persons, the issue before us resolves to whether the special assessment is a \u201cpunishment\u201d as that term is used in the Assimila-tive Crimes Act. As such, the issue is one of federal and not state law. <em>Johnson v. Yellow Cab Transit Co., </em>321 U.S. 383, 64 S.Ct. 622, 88 L.Ed. 814 (1944).</p>\n<p id=\"b1140-11\">The term \u201cpunishment\u201d is not defined in the Assimilative Crimes Act. Where a statute contains no definition of the term in question, the general rule is that the word is to be interpreted in its ordinary, everyday sense. <em>First Nat. Bank &amp; Trust Co. of Chickasha v. United States, </em>462 F.2d 908 (10th Cir.1972). Accordingly, we adopt the definition of punishment set forth in Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 1398 (rev. 4th ed. 1968) as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AnB8\">Any pain, penalty, suffering, or confinement inflicted upon a person by the authority of the law and the judgment and sentence of a court, for some crime or offense committed by him, or for his omission of a duty enjoined by law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"a3s-dedup-0\">Those cases which have considered the term in connection with the question of whether a specific statute can be incorporated into the federal law under the Assimi-lative Crimes Act have found the word to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1021\">*1021</page-number>have a broad and inclusive meaning. <em>United States v. Vaughan, </em>682 F.2d 290, 294 (2nd Cir.1982); <em>cf. United States v. Dunn, </em>545 F.2d 1281 (10th Cir.1976); <em>United States v. Best, </em>573 F.2d 1095 (9th Cir.1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b1141-5\">In light of this definition and its broad scope, we can reach no other conclusion but that the special assessment at issue in this case constitutes a form of \u201cpunishment,\u201d which, when imposed upon those persons convicted of assimilative crimes, violates both the Assimilative Crimes Act\u2019s \u201csubject to like punishment\u201d limitation and the Act\u2019s purposes. An examination of the special assessment statute\u2019s language, its legislative history, and the policy behind the Assi-milative Crimes Act supports our conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1141-6\">On its face, the statute appears penal in nature. First, although monetary, the assessment clearly places an additional burden or penalty upon the defendant. <em>Ex Parte Lange, </em>85 U.S. 163, 18 Wall. 163, 21 L.Ed. 872 (1873); <em>See Ward v. Coleman, </em>598 F.2d 1187, 1193 (10th Cir.1979), <em>rev\u2019d on other grounds, United States v. Ward, </em>448 U.S. 242, 100 S.Ct. 2636, 65 L.Ed.2d 742 (1980) (monetary penalties inflict pocketbook deterrence or restraint). Second, the assessment can be imposed only following conviction of a crime or offense against the United States. As such, its imposition is a direct consequence of conviction rather than, for example, a tax upon the general public. (An acquitted defendant escapes imposition of the assessment.) Third, the statute imposes a higher assessment on those persons convicted of felonies than on those convicted of misdemeanors. In our judgment, the assessment of higher penalties for more serious crimes as an aspect of \u201cmaking the punishment fit the crime,\u201d furthers the punitive objective. Last, the statute, by its own terms, provides that the amount assessed will be collected in the same way that fines are collected in criminal cases. The practical effect of this provision is to make the assessment indistinguishable from a criminal fine.</p>\n<p id=\"b1141-7\">Additional support can be found in the statute\u2019s legislative history. Despite the fact that the section\u2019s stated purpose is to assist victims of criminal activity by establishing a relief fund, there can be little doubt that Congress understood the assessment to be at least partially punitive. In this regard, we note the Senate Report, which accompanied Senate Bill 2423, acknowledges that income generated through the assessment will not be substantial. S.Rep. No. 497, 98th Cong., 2d Sess. 13, <em>reprinted in </em>1984 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad. News 3607, 3619. Such a statement casts doubt upon the notion that the Act\u2019s sole purpose was to raise revenue. We also point out that the same purpose \u2014 raising revenue to offset the costs of the victims relief program \u2014 was attributed to the fine increase section of the 1984 Crime Act. S.Rep. No. 497, 98th Cong., 2d Sess. 14, <em>reprinted in </em>U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News 3607, 3620. Moreover, we think it of some import that the actual provision of \u00a7 1405(a) of the 1984 Crime Act entitles the section, \u201cPenalty Assessment,\u201d 98 Stat. 2174; the Senate Report accompanying the bill refers to the assessment as a \u201cpenalty fee\u201d and as \u201cpenalties\u201d; and the Senate Report terms the section \u201cPenalty Assessment Fines.\u201d S.Rep. No. 497, 98th Cong., 2d Sess. 13, <em>reprinted in </em>1984 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News 3607, 3619.</p>\n<p id=\"b1141-9\">Finally, we note application of special assessments to persons convicted of assimilative crimes would violate the fundamental policy underlying the Assimilative Crimes Act. As stated previously, the policy behind that Act is to insure that those persons alleged to have engaged in a non-federal criminal act on a federal enclave be treated as if the crime had occurred in the surrounding state. <em>United States v. Press Publishing Co., supra, </em>219 U.S. at 10, 31 S.Ct. at 214; <em>United States v. Sharpnack, </em>355 U.S. 286, 78 S.Ct. 291, 2 L.Ed.2d 282 (1958). Imposition of the \u00a7 3013 assessment on those persons convicted of assimilative crimes clearly places an additional penalty on those who commit state crimes on federal enclaves. As such, application of the assessment to persons convicted of assimilative crimes in federal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1022\">*1022</page-number>court is contrary to the Assimilative Crimes Act\u2019s principle of conformity to state criminal law. <em>United States v. Marcyes, </em>557 F.2d 1361 (9th Cir.1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b1142-4\">For the reasons expressed above, absent a specific directive from Congress that the special assessment be imposed on those persons convicted of assimilative crimes, we decline to so apply the assessment in this case. Accordingly, we reverse and remand with instructions to vacate the assessments against the defendant.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
