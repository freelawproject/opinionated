Because the individual who is the subject of this action has represented to this court that he may be seriously endangered if any information concerning this action is made public or revealed in a written opinion, this court has determined to preserve his anonymity in this opinion and to refer to him simply as \"G.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b1511-5\">FLETCHER, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b1511-6\">The United States appeals the district court\u2019s order, issued after an initial status conference, to expunge or seal all records in the possession of the district court, the United States Department of Justice, and the FBI relating to G\u2019s 1962 arrest, indictment, and conviction for counterfeiting and his 1972 presidential pardon. Because there is not an adequate record in this case and no statement of reasons for the district court\u2019s decision that we can review, we vacate the district court\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b1511-7\">In 1962, G was indicted on and pled guilty to counterfeiting charges under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 472, 473, and 474. He was fined $250 and placed on probation for one year. G subsequently applied for presidential pardons in 1968 and 1971, and was finally granted a pardon in 1972.</p>\n<p id=\"b1511-8\">In 1983, G\u2019s attorney contacted the Chief Judge and the United States Attorney\u2019s office of the Central District of California, where G had pled guilty over twenty years before, and notified them that G had allegedly made a binding agreement with the government in 1962 under which his criminal record would be expunged. According to G\u2019s counsel, G had been \u201cinnocent of the crime [of counterfeiting in 1962, had] participated in it solely as an informant for the Secret Service, and [had been] promised both a pardon and expungement in a binding agreement with the United States if, in order to preserve the undercover nature of his participation, he agreed to be convicted.\u201d G further maintains that all the federal agents and attorneys who could verify his claims are now dead. Moreover, because the government destroys its files in criminal cases after 20 years have elapsed, there are no longer any documents that can verify or refute G\u2019s claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b1511-9\">After G\u2019s counsel contacted the- district court, it scheduled a status conference concerning G\u2019s expunction request, which G, his counsel, and an Assistant U.S. Attorney attended. The government took the position that G should be required to make \u201ca sworn declaration setting forth in detail the basis for his claim.\u201d G objected to disclosing any information on the record, claiming that \u201che might still be seriously endangered\u201d if any information were made public. G instead offered to address the district court off the record, or to rely simply upon his own \u201cgood record\u201d as sufficient justification for the expunction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1511-11\">The transcript of the status conference does not indicate that the district court heard any statement from G. There is no indication that the district court attempted to have G testify in an <em>in camera </em>proceeding, or that it requested him to make a sworn declaration that it could review <em>in camera. </em>However, at oral argument before this court, G\u2019s counsel stated in no uncertain terms that information <em>was </em>provided to the district court judge concerning the particulars of G\u2019s expunction request and his reasons for believing that secrecy was necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b1511-12\">After briefly questioning the government\u2019s attorney about the United States\u2019 reasons for opposing G\u2019s expunction request, the district court announced at the status conference that it would grant G\u2019s request. The court subsequently issued a written order requiring the expunction of all district court records relating to G\u2019s indictment and conviction, and requiring the sealing of all records of G\u2019s arrest, conviction, and pardon in the possession of the FBI and Department of Justice. It is this order from which the United States appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b1511-13\">This court has jurisdiction over the United States\u2019 appeal under either 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 or 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3731. Although the district court did not specifically indicate its basis for exercising jurisdiction in its expunction order, to the extent that the district court\u2019s order constituted an injunction against the United States and its agencies, the order was a \u201cfinal decision\u201d and was therefore appealable to this court under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 (1982). To the extent that the district court\u2019s expunction order was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1394\">*1394</page-number>merely a continuation of G\u2019s twenty-year-old criminal action, this court has jurisdiction over the United States\u2019 appeal under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3731, the Federal Criminal Appeals Act. <em>United States v. Hetrick, </em>644 F.2d 752, 755 &amp; n. 3 (9th Cir.1981); <em>United States v. Dior, </em>671 F.2d 351, 355 (9th Cir.1982); <em>see United States v. Wilson, </em>420 U.S. 332, 337, 95 S.Ct. 1013, 1018, 43 L.Ed.2d 232 (1975); <em>United States v. Martin Linen Supply Co., </em>430 U.S. 564, 568, 97 S.Ct. 1349, 1352, 51 L.Ed.2d 642 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b1512-4\">However, from the record before us, it is impossible to review the district court\u2019s decision, or even to determine whether or on what basis the district court had jurisdiction or authority to grant G\u2019s expunction request.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> There are no facts in the record concerning either the legal basis for G\u2019s claim or his personal reasons for needing his record to be expunged. Moreover, the district court\u2019s terse order granting expunction provides no information whatsoever concerning its basis of jurisdiction, the standards it applied, or its reasons for granting G\u2019s request.</p>\n<p id=\"b1512-5\">Thus, on the record before us, we are unable to rule on the government\u2019s claim that the district court lacked jurisdiction. This court and others have ruled that courts may order expunction in cases where there has been an unlawful arrest, where an arrest has been made merely for harassment purposes, or where the statute under which an individual was prosecuted has subsequently been determined to be unconstitutional, as part of their broad equitable powers to fashion remedies for deprivations of constitutional rights. <em>See, e.g., Maurer v. Los Angeles County Sheriffs Department, </em>691 F.2d 434, 437 (9th Cir.1982); <em>Shipp v. Todd, </em>568 F.2d 133, 134 (9th Cir.1978); <em>Menard v. Saxbe, </em>498 F.2d 1017, 1023 (D.C.Cir.1974); <em>Paton v. LaPrade, </em>524 F.2d 862, 866-69 (3d Cir.1975); <em>Severson v. Duff, </em>322 F.Supp. 4, 10 (M.D.Fla.1970); <em>Kowall v. United States, </em>53 F.R.D. 211, 212-216 (W.D.Mich.1971). Moreover, courts have jurisdiction and authority to order individuals\u2019 criminal records to be expunged in certain situations expressly provided by statute. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Doe, </em>730 F.2d 1529, 1530-31 (D.C.Cir.1984) (applying the Federal Youth Corrections Act\u2019s \u201cset-aside\u201d provision for convictions, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 5021(b)); <em>Doe v. Webster, </em>606 F.2d 1226, 1232-33 (D.C.Cir.1979) (applying 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 5021(b)); <em>see also </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 844(b)(2) (authorizing expunction of records relating to arrest and conviction of individuals under 21 years of age for simple possession of a controlled substance). However, it is not clear from the record whether the district court found there to be a constitutional or statutory basis for its order in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1512-11\">Some courts have ordered expunction of individuals\u2019 records as part of their \u201cancillary jurisdiction\u201d over those individuals\u2019 original criminal actions. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Schnitzer, </em>567 F.2d 536, 538 (2d Cir.1977), <em>cert. denied, </em>435 U.S. 907, 98 S.Ct. 1456, 55 L.Ed.2d 499 (1978); <em>Morrow v. District of Columbia, </em>417 F.2d 728, 740 (D.C.Cir.1969); <em>see also United States v. Linn, </em>513 F.2d 925, 927 (10th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>423 U.S. 836, 96 S.Ct. 63, 46 L.Ed.2d 55 (1975). Other courts have asserted that they have \u201cinherent power\u201d to expunge criminal records when necessary to vindicate an individual\u2019s \u201csubstantial rights.\u201d <em>See, e.g., Menard v. Saxbe, </em>498 F.2d 1017, 1023 (D.C.Cir.1974); <em>United States v. McMains, </em>540 F.2d 387, 389 (8th Cir.1976); <em>Natwig v. Webster, </em>562 F.Supp. 225, 227 (D.R.I.1983); <em>United States v. Bohr, </em>406 F.Supp. 1218, 1219 (E.D.Wisc. 1976); <em>see also Allen v. Webster, </em>742 F.2d 153, 154-55 (4th Cir.1984); <em>Diamond v. United States, </em>649 F.2d 496, 497-98 (7th Cir.1981). Since the district court did not rely explicitly upon either \u201cancillary jurisdiction\u201d or its \u201cinherent power\u201d in granting G\u2019s request, we need not decide whether either of these rationales provides a basis for expunction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1512-12\">Even assuming that the district court had jurisdiction to grant G\u2019s expunction request, we cannot tell what standards the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1395\">*1395</page-number>district court applied in evaluating G\u2019s request or upon what facts it based its decision. We recognize that G's counsel represented to the district court that any public testimony by his client might jeopardize G\u2019s safety. However, the district court could have protected G by taking his testimony <em>in camera </em>and preparing a sealed record for this court to review. <em>See Diamond v. United States, </em>649 F.2d 496, 499 (7th Cir.1981) (when ruling on expunction requests, it \u201cbehooves the district court to develop a complete factual record\u201d). To the extent that such information was provided off the record to the district court judge, as G\u2019s counsel indicated during oral argument, this procedure was irregular and inappropriate, and it has frustrated this court\u2019s ability to review the district court\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b1513-5\">Because the district court has not provided any reasons for its decision and has not provided a sufficient factual record for analysis on appeal, we vacate its order.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1513-6\">ORDER VACATED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1512-7\">. At oral argument, G\u2019s counsel argued to this court that it should simply defer to the decision of the district court judge, and essentially accept on faith his conclusions about G and the validity of G\u2019s request. We cannot accept this contention.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1513-18\">. We vacate without prejudice to the filing of a new request for expunction or sealing.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
