(hereinafter sometimes referred to collectively as \u201cHanson\u201d) appeal from an order of the Southern District of New York, 617 F.Supp. 832 (1985), Shirley Wohl Kram, Judge, granting SCM Corporation\u2019s motion for a preliminary injunction restraining them, their officers, agents, employees and any persons acting in concert with them, from acquiring any shares of SCM and from exercising any voting rights with respect to 3.1 million SCM shares acquired by them on September 11, 1985. The injunction was granted on the ground that Hanson\u2019s September 11 acquisition of the SCM stock through five private and one open market purchases amounted to a \u201ctender offer\u201d for more than 5% of SCM\u2019s outstanding shares, which violated \u00a7\u00a7 14(d)(1) and (6) of the Williams Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78n(d)(1) and (6)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and rules promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) thereunder. <em>See </em>17 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 240.14(e)(1) and 240.14d-7.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-11\">The setting is the familiar one of a fast-moving bidding contest for control of a large public corporation: first, a cash <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>tender offer of $60 per share by Hanson, an outsider, addressed to SCM stockholders; next, a counterproposal by an \u201cinsider\u201d group consisting of certain SCM managers and their \u201cWhite Knight,\u201d Merrill Lynch Capital Markets (Merrill), for a \u201cleveraged buyout\u201d at a higher price ($70 per share); then an increase by Hanson of its cash offer to $72 per share, followed by a revised SCM-Merrill leveraged buyout offer of $74 per share with a \u201ccrown jewel\u201d irrevocable lock-up option to Merrill designed to discourage Hanson from seeking control by providing that if any other party (in this case Hanson) should acquire more than one-third of SCM\u2019s outstanding shares (66%% being needed under N.Y.Bus.L. \u00a7 903(a)(2) to effectuate a merger) Merrill would have the right to buy SCM\u2019s two most profitable businesses (consumer foods and pigments) at prices characterized by some as \u201cbargain basement.\u201d The final act in this scenario was the decision of Hanson, having been deterred by the SCM-Merrill option (colloquially described in the market as a \u201cpoison pill\u201d), to terminate its cash tender offer and then to make private purchases, amounting to 25% of SCM\u2019s outstanding shares, leading SCM to seek and obtain the preliminary injunction from which this appeal is taken. A more detailed history of relevant events follows.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-5\">SCM is a New York corporation with its principal place of business in New York City. Its shares, of which at all relevant times at least 9.9 million were outstanding and 2.3 million were subject to issuance upon conversion of other outstanding securities, are traded on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) and Pacific Stock Exchange. Hanson Trust PLC is an English company with its principal place of business in London. HSCM, a Delaware corporation, and Hanson Holdings Netherlands B.V., a Netherlands limited liability company, are indirect wholly-owned subsidiaries of Hanson Trust PLC.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-6\">On August 21,1985, Hanson publicly announced its intention to make a cash tender offer of $60 per share for any and all outstanding SCM shares. Five days later it filed the tender offer documents required by \u00a7 14(d)(1) of the Williams Act and regulations issued thereunder. The offer provided that it would remain open until September 23, unless extended, that no shares would be accepted until September 10, and that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b171-8\">\u201cWhether or not the Purchasers [Hanson] purchase Shares pursuant to the Offer, the Purchasers may thereafter determine, subject to the availability of Shares at favorable prices and the availability of financing, to purchase additional Shares in the open market, in privately negotiated transactions, through another tender offer or otherwise. Any such purchases of additional Shares might be on terms which are the same as, or more or less favorable than, those of this Offer. The Purchasers also reserve the right to dispose of any or all Shares acquired by them.\u201d <em>Offer to Purchase For Cash Any and All Outstanding Shares of Common Stock of SCM Corporation </em>(Aug. 26, 1985) at 21.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b171-9\">On August 30, 1985, SCM, having recommended to SCM\u2019s stockholders that they not accept Hanson\u2019s tender offer, announced a preliminary agreement with Merrill under which a new entity, formed by SCM and Merrill, would acquire all SCM shares at $70 per share in a leveraged buyout sponsored by Merrill. Under the agreement, which was executed on September 3, the new entity would make a $70 per share cash tender offer for approximately 85% of SCM\u2019s shares. If more than two-thirds of SCM\u2019s shares were acquired under the offer the remaining SCM shares would be acquired in exchange for debentures in a new corporation to be formed as a result of the merger. On the same date, September 3, Hanson increased its tender offer from $60 to $72 cash per share. However, it expressly reserved the right to terminate its offer if SCM granted to anyone any option to purchase SCM assets on terms that Hanson believed to constitute a \u201clock-up\u201d device. <em>Supplement Dated September 5, 1985, to Offer to Purchase, </em>at 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-10\">The next development in the escalating bidding contest for control of SCM oc<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>curred on September 10, 1985, when SCM entered into a new leveraged buyout agreement with its \u201cWhite Knight,\u201d Merrill. The agreement provided for a two-step acquisition of SCM stock by Merrill at $74 per share. The first proposed step was to be the acquisition of approximately 82% of SCM\u2019s outstanding stock for cash. Following a merger (which required acquisition of at least 66%%), debentures would be issued for the remaining SCM shares. If any investor or group other than Merrill acquired more than one-third of SCM\u2019s outstanding shares, Merrill would have the option to buy SCM\u2019s two most profitable businesses, pigments and consumer foods, for $350 and $80 million respectively, prices which Hanson believed to be below their market value.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-4\">Hanson, faced with what it considered to be a \u201cpoison pill,\u201d concluded that even if it increased its cash tender offer to $74 per share it would end up with control of a substantially depleted and damaged company. Accordingly, it announced on the Dow Jones Broad Tape at 12:38 P.M. on September 11 that it was terminating its cash tender offer. A few minutes later, Hanson issued a press release, carried on the Broad Tape, to the effect that \u201call SCM shares tendered will be promptly returned to the tendering shareholders.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b172-5\">At some time in the late forenoon or early afternoon of September 11 Hanson decided to make cash purchases of a substantial percentage of SCM stock in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions. Under British law Hanson could not acquire more than 49% of SCM\u2019s shares in this fashion without obtaining certain clearances, but acquisition of such a large percentage was not necessary to stymie the SCM-Merrill merger proposal. If Hanson could acquire slightly less than one-third of SCM\u2019s outstanding shares it would be able to block the $74 per share SCM-Merrill offer of a leveraged buyout. This might induce the latter to work out an agreement with Hanson, something Hanson had unsuccessfully sought on several occasions since its first cash tender offer.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-9\">Within a period of two hours on the afternoon of September 11 Hanson made five privately-negotiated cash purchases of SCM stock and one open-market purchase, acquiring 3.1 million shares or 25% of SCM\u2019s outstanding stock. The price of SCM stock on the NYSE on September 11 ranged from a high of $73.50 per share to a low of $72.50 per share. Hanson\u2019s initial private purchase, 387,700 shares from Mutual Shares, was not solicited by Hanson but by a Mutual Shares official, Michael Price, who, in a conversation with Robert Pirie of Rothschild, Inc., Hanson\u2019s financial advisor, on the morning of September 11 (before Hanson had decided to make any private cash purchases), had stated that he was interested in selling Mutual\u2019s Shares\u2019 SCM stock to Hanson. Once Hanson\u2019s decision to buy privately had been made, Pirie took Price up on his offer. The parties negotiated a sale at $73.50 per share after Pirie refused Price\u2019s asking prices, first of $75 per share and, later, of $74.50 per share. This transaction, but not the identity of the parties, was automatically reported pursuant to NYSE rules on the NYSE ticker at 3:11 P.M. and reported on the Dow Jones Broad Tape at 3:29 P.M.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-10\">Pirie then telephoned Ivan Boesky, an arbitrageur who had a few weeks earlier disclosed in a Schedule 13D statement filed with the SEC<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> that he owned approximate<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>ly 12.7% of SCM\u2019s outstanding shares. Pi-rie negotiated a Hanson purchase of these shares at $73.50 per share after rejecting Boesky\u2019s initial demand of $74 per share. At the same time Rothschild purchased for Hanson\u2019s account 600,000 SCM shares in the open market at $73.50 per share. An attempt by Pirie next to negotiate the cash purchase of another large block of SCM stock (some 780,000 shares) from Slifka &amp; Company fell through because of the latter\u2019s inability to make delivery of the shares on September 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-5\">Following the NYSE ticker and Broad Tape reports of the first two large anonymous transactions in SCM stock, some professional investors surmised that the buyer might be Hanson. Rothschild then received telephone calls from (1) Mr. Mulh-earn of Jamie &amp; Co. offering to sell between 200,000 and 350,000 shares at $73.50 per share, (2) David Gottesman, an arbitrageur at Oppenheimer &amp; Co. offering 89,-000 shares at $73.50, and (3) Boyd Jeffries of Jeffries &amp; Co., offering approximately 700,000 to 800,000 shares at $74.00. Pirie purchased the three blocks for Hanson at $73.50 per share. The last of Hanson\u2019s cash purchases was completed by 4:35 P.M. on September 11, 1985.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-10\">In the early evening of September 11 SCM successfully applied to Judge Kram in the present lawsuit for a restraining order barring Hanson from acquiring more SCM stock for 24 hours. On September 12 and 13 the TRO was extended by consent pending the district court\u2019s decision on SCM\u2019s application for a preliminary injunction. Judge Kram held an evidentiary hearing on September 12-13, at which various witnesses testified, including Sir Gordon White, Hanson\u2019s United States Chairman, two Rothschild representatives (Pirie and Gerald Goldsmith) and stock market risk-arbitrage professionals (Robert Freeman of Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co., Kenneth Miller of Merrill Lynch, and Danial Burch of D.F. King &amp; Co.). Sir Gordon White testified that on September 11, 1985, after learning of the $74 per share SCM-Merrill leveraged buyout tender offer with its \u201ccrown jewel\u201d irrevocable \u201clock-up\u201d option to Merrill, he instructed Pirie to terminate Hanson\u2019s $72 per share tender offer, and that only thereafter did he discuss the possibility of Hanson making market purchases of SCM stock. Pirie testified that the question of buying stock may have been discussed in the late forenoon of September 11 and that he had told White that he was having Hanson\u2019s New York counsel look into whether <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>such cash purchases were legally permissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-4\">SCM argued before Judge Kram (and argues here) that Hanson\u2019s cash purchases immediately following its termination of its $72 per share tender offer amounted to a <em>de facto </em>continuation of Hanson\u2019s tender offer, designed to avoid the strictures of \u00a7 14(d) of the Williams Act, and that unless a preliminary injunction issued SCM and its shareholders would be irreparably injured because Hanson would acquire enough shares to defeat the SCM-Merrill offer. Judge Kram found that the relevant underlying facts (which we have outlined) were not in dispute, Memorandum Opinion and Order, at 6 (Sept. 14, 1985), and concluded that \u201c[wjithout deciding what test should ultimately be applied to determine whether Hanson\u2019s conduct constitutes a \u2018tender offer\u2019 within the meaning of the Williams Act ... SCM has demonstrated a likelihood of success on the merits of its contention that Hanson has engaged in a tender offer which violates Section 14(d) of the Williams Act.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 7. The district court, characterizing Hanson\u2019s stock purchases as \u201ca deliberate attempt to do an \u2018end run\u2019 around the requirements of the Williams Act,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 8, made no finding on the question of whether Hanson had decided to make the purchases of SCM before or after it dropped its tender offer but concluded that even if the decision had been made after it terminated its offer preliminary injunctive relief should issue. From this decision Hanson appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-5\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b174-6\">A preliminary injunction will be overturned only when the district court abuses its discretion. <em>See Doran v. Salem Inn, Inc., </em>422 U.S. 922, 931-32, 95 S.Ct. 2561, 2567-68, 45 L.Ed.2d 648 (1975); <em>Application of U.S. In Matter of Order Authorizing the Use of a Pen Register, </em>538 F.2d 956, 961 (2d Cir.1976) (All-Writs Act), <em>rev\u2019d on other grounds sub nom. United States v. New York Telephone Co., </em>434 U.S. 159, 98 S.Ct. 364, 54 L.Ed.2d 376 (1977). An abuse of discretion may be found when the district court relies on clearly erroneous findings of fact or on an error of law in issuing the injunction. <em>See Coca-Cola Co. v. Tropicana Products, Inc., </em>690 F.2d 312, 315-16 (2d Cir.1982); <em>cf. Anderson v. City of Bessemer City, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 105 S.Ct. 1504, 84 L.Ed.2d 518 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b174-10\">Since, as the district court correctly noted, the material relevant facts in the present case are not in dispute, this appeal turns on whether the district court erred as a matter of law in holding that when Hanson terminated its offer and immediately thereafter made private purchases of a substantial share of the target company\u2019s outstanding stock, the purchases became a \u201ctender offer\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 14(d) of the Williams Act. Absent any express definition of \u201ctender offer\u201d in the Act, the answer requires a brief review of the background and purposes of \u00a7 14(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b174-11\">Congress adopted \u00a7 14(d) in 1968 \u201cin response to the growing use of cash tender offers as a means of achieving corporate takeovers ... which ... removed a substantial number of corporate control contests from the reach of existing disclosure requirements of the federal securities laws.\u201d <em>Piper v. Chris-Craft Industries, </em>430 U.S. 1, 22, 97 S.Ct. 926, 939, 51 L.Ed.2d 124 (1977). <em>See also </em>S.Rep. No. 550, 90th Cong., 1st Sess., 2-4 (1967) (Senate Report); H.R.Rep.

The offer was usually accompanied by newspaper and other publicity, a time limit for tender of shares in response to it, and a provision fixing a quantity limit on the total number of shares of the target company that would be purchased.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-4\">Prior to the Williams Act a tender offer- or had no obligation to disclose any information to shareholders when making a bid. The Report of the Senate Committee on Banking and Currency aptly described the situation: \u201cby using a cash tender offer the person seeking control can operate in almost complete secrecy. At present, the law does not even require that he disclose his identity, the source of his funds, who his associates are, or what he intends to do if he gains control of the corporation.\u201d Senate Report, <em>supra, </em>at 2. <em>See also </em>House Report, <em>supra, </em>at 2, U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News 1968, at 2812. The average shareholder, pressured by the fact that the tender offer would be available for only a short time and restricted to a limited number of shares, was forced \u201cwith severely limited information, [to] decide what course of action he should take.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2, U.S. Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News 1968, at 2812. \u201cWithout knowledge of who the bidder is and what he plans to do, the shareholder cannot reach an informed decision. He is forced to take a chance. For no matter what he does, he does it without adequate information to enable him to decide rationally what is the best possible course of action.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2, U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News 1968, at 2812; Senate Report, <em>supra, </em>at 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-7\">The purpose of the Williams Act was, accordingly, to protect the shareholders from that dilemma by insuring \u201cthat public shareholders who are confronted by a cash tender offer for their stock will not be required to respond without adequate information.\u201d <em>Piper v. Chris-Craft Industries, </em>430 U.S. 1, 35, 97 S.Ct. 926, 946, 51 L.Ed.2d 124 (1977); <em>Rondeau v. Mosinee Paper Corp., </em>422 U.S. 49, 58, 95 S.Ct. 2069, 2075, 45 L.Ed.2d 12 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b175-8\">Congress took \u201cextreme care,\u201d 113 Cong. Rec. 24664 (Senator Williams); <em>id. </em>at 854 (Senator Williams), however, when protecting shareholders, to avoid \u201ctipping the balance of regulation either in favor of management or in favor of the person making the takeover bid.\u201d House Report, <em>supra, </em>at 4, U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News 1968, at 2813; Senator Report, <em>supra, </em>at 4. Indeed, the initial draft of the bill, proposed in 1965, had been designed to prevent \u201cproud old companies [from being] reduced to corporate shells after white-collar pirates have seized control,\u201d 111 Cong.Rec. 28257 (Oct. 22, 1965) (Senator Williams). Williams withdrew that draft following claims that it was too biased in favor of incumbent management. Tyson &amp; August, \u201cThe Williams Act After RICO: Has the Balance Tipped in Favor of Incumbent Management?\u201d 33 Hastings L.J. 53, 61 (1983). In the end, Congress considered it crucial that the act be neutral and place \u201c \u2018investors on an equal footing with the takeover bidder\u2019 ... without favoring either the tender offeror or existing management.\u201d <em>Piper, supra, 430 </em>U.S. at 30, 97 S.Ct. at 943 (quoting Senate Report, <em>supra, </em>at 4). <em>See also Rondeau, supra, </em>422 U.S. at 58 n. 8, 95 S.Ct. at 2076 n. 8; <em>Edgar v.

Congress\u2019 failure to define \u201ctender offer\u201d was deliberate. Aware of \u201cthe almost infinite variety in the terms of most tender offers\u201d and concerned that a rigid definition would be evaded, Congress left to the court and the SEC the flexibility to define the term. House Hearings, <em>supra, </em>at 18 (Manuel Cohen, S.E.C. Chairman). <em>See also </em>Letter from Senators Proxmire, Sarbanes and Williams to Harold M. Williams, Chairman of the S.E.C. (July 3, 1979) <em>reprinted in </em>Securities and Exchange Commission Report on Tender Offer Laws, printed for the use of the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs 3 (Comm.Print 1980); <em>Smallwood v. Pearl Brewing Co., </em>489 F.2d 579, 598 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>419 U.S. 873, 95 S.Ct. 134, 42 L.Ed.2d 113 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b176-4\">Although \u00a7 14(d)(1) clearly applies to \u201cclassic\u201d tender offers of the type described above (pp. 54-55), courts soon recognized that in the case of privately negotiated transactions or solicitations for private purchases of stock many of the conditions leading to the enactment of \u00a7 14(d) for the most part do not exist. The number and percentage of stockholders are usually far less than those involved in public offers. The solicitation involves less publicity than a public tender offer or none. The solicitees, who are frequently directors, officers or substantial stockholders of the target, are more apt to be sophisticated, inquiring or knowledgeable concerning the target\u2019s business, the solicitor\u2019s objectives, and the impact of the solicitation on the target\u2019s business prospects. In short, the solicitee in the private transaction is less likely to be pressured, confused, or ill-informed regarding the businesses and decisions at stake than solicitees who are the subjects of a public tender offer.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-5\">These differences between public and private securities transactions have led most courts to rule that private transactions or open market purchases do not qualify as a \u201ctender offer\u201d requiring the purchaser to meet the pre-filing strictures of \u00a7 14(d). <em>Kennecott Copper Corp. v.

The borderline between public solicitations and privately negotiated stock purchases is not bright and it is frequently difficult to determine whether transactions falling close to the line or in a type of \u201cno man\u2019s land\u201d are \u201ctender offers\u201d or private deals. This has led some to advocate a broader interpretation of the term \u201ctender offer\u201d than that followed by us in <em>Kennecott Copper Corp. v. Curtiss-Wright Corp., supra, </em>584 F.2d at 1207, and to adopt the eight-factor \u201ctest\u201d of what is a tender offer, which was recommended by the SEC and applied by the district court in <em>Wellman v. Dickinson, </em>475 F.Supp. 783, 823-24 (S.D.N.Y.1979), aff<em>'d on other grounds, </em>682 F.2d 355 (2d Cir.1982), <em>cert. denied, </em>460 U.S. 1069, 103 S.Ct. 1522, 75 L.Ed.2d 946 (1983), and by the Ninth Circuit in <em>SEC v. Carter Hawley Hale Stores, Inc., supra. </em>The eight factors are:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b176-7\">\u201c(1) active and widespread solicitation of public shareholders for the shares of an issuer;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b176-8\">(2) solicitation made for a substantial percentage of the issuer\u2019s stock;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b177-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>(3) offer to purchase made at a premium over the prevailing market price;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b177-4\">(4) terms of the offer are firm rather than negotiable;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b177-5\">(5) offer contingent on the tender of a fixed number of shares, often subject to a fixed maximum number to be purchased;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b177-6\">(6) offer open only for a limited period of time;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b177-7\"><em>(7) </em>offeree subjected to pressure to sell his stock;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b177-8\">[(8)] public announcements of a purchasing program concerning the target company precede or accompany rapid accumulation of large amounts of the target company\u2019s securities.\u201d (475 F.Supp. at 823-24).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b177-9\">Although many of the above-listed factors are relevant for purposes of determining whether a given solicitation amounts to a tender offer, the elevation of such a list to a mandatory \u201clitmus test\u201d appears to be both unwise and unnecessary. As even the advocates of the proposed test recognize, in any given case a solicitation may constitute a tender offer even though some of the eight factors are absent or, when many factors are present, the solicitation may nevertheless not amount to a tender offer because the missing factors outweigh those present. <em>Id., </em>at 824; <em>Carter, supra, </em>at 950.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-10\">We prefer to be guided by the principle followed by the Supreme Court in deciding what transactions fall within the private offering exemption provided by \u00a7 4(1) of the Securities Act of 1933, and by ourselves in <em>Kennecott Copper </em>in determining whether the Williams Act applies to private transactions. That principle is simply to look to the statutory purpose. In <em>S.E.C. v. Ralston Purina Co., </em>346 U.S. 119, 73 S.Ct. 981, 97 L.Ed. 1494 (1953), the Court stated, \u201cthe applicability of \u00a7 4(1) should turn on whether the particular class of persons affected need the protection of the Act. An offering to those who are shown to be able to fend for themselves is a transaction \u2018not involving any public offering.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id., </em>at 125, 73 S.Ct. at 984. Similarly, since the purpose of \u00a7 14(d) is to protect the ill-informed solicitee, the question of whether a solicitation constitutes a \u201ctender offer\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 14(d) turns on whether, viewing the transaction in the light of the totality of circumstances, there appears .to be a likelihood that unless the pre-acquisition filing strictures of that statute are followed there will be a substantial risk that solicitees will lack information needed to make a carefully considered appraisal of the proposal put before them.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-13\">Applying this standard, we are persuaded on the undisputed facts that Hanson\u2019s September 11 negotiation of five private purchases and one open market purchase of SCM shares, totalling 25% of SCM\u2019s outstanding stock, did not under the circumstances constitute a \u201ctender offer\u201d within the meaning of the Williams Act. Putting aside for the moment the events preceding the purchases, there can be little doubt that the privately negotiated purchases would not, standing alone, qualify as a tender offer, for the following reasons:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b177-14\">(1) In a market of 22,800 SCM shareholders the number of SCM sellers here involved, six in all, was miniscule compared with the numbers involved in public solicitations of the type against which the Act was directed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b177-15\">(2) At least five of the sellers were highly sophisticated professionals, knowledgeable in the market place and well aware of the essential facts needed to exercise their professional skills and to appraise Hanson\u2019s offer, including its financial condition as well as that of SCM, the likelihood that the purchases might block the SCM-Merrill bid, and the risk that if Hanson acquired more than 33V3% of SCM\u2019s stock the SCM-Merrill lockup of the \u201ccrown jewel\u201d might be triggered. Indeed, by September 11 they had all had access to (1) Hanson\u2019s 27-page detailed disclosure of facts, filed on August 26, 1985, in accordance with \u00a7 14(d)(1) with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>respect to its $60 tender offer, (2) Hanson\u2019s 4-page amendment of that offer, dated September 5, 1985, increasing the price to $72 per share, and (3) press releases regarding the basic terms of the SCM-Merrill proposed leveraged buyout at $74 per share and of the SCM-Merrill asset option agreement under which SCM granted to Merrill the irrevocable right under certain conditions to buy SCM\u2019s consumer food business for $80 million and its pigment business for $350 million.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b178-4\">(3) The sellers were not \u201cpressured\u201d to sell their shares by any conduct that the Williams Act was designed to alleviate, but by the forces of the market place. Indeed, in the case of Mutual Shares there was no initial solicitation by Hanson; the offer to sell was initiated by Mr. Price of Mutual Shares. Although each of the Hanson purchases was made for $73.50 per share, in most instances this price was the result of private negotiations after the sellers sought higher prices and in one case price protection, demands which were refused. The $73.50 price was not fixed in advance by Hanson. Moreover, the sellers remained free to accept the $74 per share tender offer made by the SCM-Merrill group.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b178-5\">(4) There was no active or widespread advance publicity or public solicitation, which is one of the earmarks of a conventional tender offer. Arbitrageurs might conclude from ticker tape reports of two large anonymous transactions that Hanson must be the buyer. However, liability for solicitation may not be predicated upon disclosures mandated by Stock Exchange Rules. See <em>S.E.C. v. Carter-Hawley Hale Stores, Inc., supra, </em>760 F.2d at 950.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b178-6\">(5) The price received by the six sellers, $73.50 per share, unlike that appearing in most tender offers, can scarcely be dignified with the label \u201cpremium.\u201d The stock market price on September 11 ranged from $72.50 to $73.50 per share. Although risk arbitrageurs sitting on large holdings might reap sizeable profits from sales to Hanson at $73.50, depending on their own purchase costs, they stood to gain even more if the SCM-Merrill offer of $74 should succeed, as it apparently would if they tendered their shares to it. Indeed, the $73.50 price, being at most $1 over market or 1.4% higher than the market price, did not meet the SEC\u2019s proposed definition of a premium, which is $2.00 per share or 5% above market price, whichever is greater. SEC Exchange Act Release No. 16,385 (11/29/79) [1979-80] Fed.Sec.L.Rep. 11 82,374.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b178-9\">(6) Unlike most tender offers, the purchases were not made contingent upon Hanson\u2019s acquiring a fixed minimum number or percentage of SCM\u2019s outstanding shares. Once an agreement with each individual seller was reached, Hanson was obligated to buy, regardless what total percentage of stock it might acquire. Indeed, it does not appear that Hanson had fixed in its mind a firm limit on the amount of SCM shares it was willing to buy.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b178-10\">(7) Unlike most tender offers, there was no general time limit within which Hanson would make purchases of SCM stock. Concededly, cash transactions are normally immediate but, assuming an inability on the part of a seller and Hanson to agree at once on a price, nothing prevented a resumption of negotiations by each of the parties except the arbitrageurs\u2019 speculation that once Hanson acquired 33V3% or an amount just short of that figure it would stop buying.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b178-11\">In short, the totality of circumstances that existed on September 11 did not evidence any likelihood that unless Hanson was required to comply with \u00a7 14(d)(l)\u2019s pre-ac-quisition filing and waiting-period requirements there would be a substantial risk of ill-considered sales of SCM stock by ill-informed shareholders.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-12\">There remains the question whether Hanson\u2019s private purchases take on a different hue, requiring them to be treated as a <em>\u201cde facto </em>\u201d continuation of its earlier tender offer, when considered in the context of Hanson\u2019s earlier acknowledged <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>tender offer, the competing offer of SCM-Merrill and Hanson\u2019s termination of its tender offer. After reviewing all of the undisputed facts we conclude that the district court erred in so holding.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-5\">In the first place, we find no record support for the contention by SCM that Hanson\u2019s September 11 termination of its outstanding tender offer was false, fraudulent or ineffective. Hanson\u2019s termination notice was clear, unequivocal and straightforward. Directions were given, and presumably are being followed, to return all of the tendered shares to the SCM shareholders who tendered them. Hanson also filed with the SEC a statement pursuant to \u00a7 14(d)(1) of the Williams Act terminating its tender offer. As a result, at the time when Hanson made its September 11 private purchases of SCM stock it owned no SCM stock other than those shares revealed in its \u00a7 14(d) pre-acquisition report filed with the SEC on August 26, 1985.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-6\">The reason for Hanson\u2019s termination of its tender offer is not disputed: in view of SCM\u2019s grant of what Hanson conceived to be a \u201cpoison pill\u201d lock-up option to Merrill, Hanson, if it acquired control of SCM, would have a company denuded as the result of its sale of its consumer food and pigment businesses to Merrill at what Hanson believed to be bargain prices. Thus, Hanson\u2019s termination of its tender offer was final; there was no tender offer to be \u201ccontinued.\u201d Hanson was unlikely to \u201cshoot itself in the foot\u201d by triggering what it believed to be a \u201cpoison pill,\u201d and it could not acquire more than 49% of SCM\u2019s shares without violating the rules of the London Stock Exchange.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-7\">Nor does the record support SCM\u2019s contention that Hanson had decided, before terminating its tender offer, to engage in cash purchases. Judge Kram referred only to evidence that \u201cHanson had <em>considered </em>open market purchases before it announced that the tender offer was dropped\u201d (emphasis added) but made no finding to that effect. Absent evidence or a finding that Hanson had decided to seek control of SCM through purchases of its stock, no duty of disclosure existed under the federal securities laws.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-9\">Second, Hanson had expressly reserved the right in its August 26, 1985, pre-acqui-sition tender offer filing papers, whether or not tendered shares were purchased, <em>\u201cthereafter </em>... to purchase additional Shares in the open market,' in privately negotiated transactions, through another tender offer or otherwise.\u201d (Emphasis added). See p. 46, <em>supra. </em>Thus, Hanson\u2019s privately negotiated purchases could hardly have taken the market by surprise. Indeed, professional arbitrageurs and market experts rapidly concluded that it was Hanson which was making the post-termination purchases.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-10\">Last, Hanson\u2019s prior disclosures of essential facts about itself and SCM in the pre-acquisition papers it filed on August 26, 1985, with the SEC pursuant to \u00a7 14(d)(1), are wholly inconsistent with the district court\u2019s characterization of Hanson\u2019s later private purchases as \u201ca deliberate attempt to do an \u2018end run\u2019 around the requirements of the Williams Act.\u201d On the contrary, the record shows that Hanson had already filed with the SEC and made public substantially the same information as SCM contends that Hanson should have filed before making the cash purchases. The term \u201ctender offer,\u201d although left somewhat flexible by Congress\u2019 decision not to define it, nevertheless remains a word of art. Section 14(d)(1) was never intended to apply to <em>every </em>acquisition of more than 5% of a public company\u2019s stock. If that were the case there would be no need for \u00a7 13(d)(1), which requires a person, <em>after </em>acquiring more than 5%, to furnish the issuer, stock exchange and the SEC with certain pertinent information. Yet the expansive definition of \u201ctender offer\u201d advocated by SCM, and to some extent by the SEC as amicus, would go far toward rendering \u00a7 13(d)(1) a dead letter. In the present case, we were advised by Hanson\u2019s counsel upon argument on September 23 that on that date it was filing with the SEC the information required by \u00a7 13(d)(1) of the Williams Act with respect to its private purchases of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>SCM stock. In our view this is all that is required by the Act in the present circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-4\">It may well be that Hanson\u2019s private acquisition of 25% of SCM\u2019s shares after termination of Hanson\u2019s tender offer was designed to block the SCM-Merrill leveraged buyout group from acquiring the 66%% of SCM\u2019s stock needed to effectuate a merger. It may be speculated that such a blocking move might induce SCM to buy Hanson\u2019s 25% at a premium or lead to negotiations between the parties designed to resolve their differences. But we know of no provision in the federal securities laws or elsewhere that prohibits such tactics in \u201chardball\u201d market battles of the type encountered here. <em>See Treadway Companies, Inc. v. Care Corp., </em>638 F.2d 357, 378-79 (2d Cir.1980) (\u201cWe also see nothing wrong in Care\u2019s efforts to acquire one third of Treadway\u2019s outstanding stock, and thus to obtain a \u2018blocking position\u2019.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b180-5\">Thus the full disclosure purposes of the Williams Act as it now stands appear to have been fully satisfied by Hanson\u2019s furnishing to the public, both before and after termination of its tender offer, all of the essential relevant facts it was required by law to supply.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-6\">SCM further contends, and in this respect it is supported by the SEC as an amicus, that upon termination of a tender offer the solicitor should be subject to a waiting or cooling-off period (10 days is suggested) before it may purchase any of the target company\u2019s outstanding shares. However, neither the Act nor any SEC rule promulgated thereunder prohibits a former tender offeror from purchasing stock of a target through privately negotiated transactions immediately after a tender offer has been terminated. Indeed, it is significant that the SEC\u2019s formal proposal for the adoption of such a rule (Proposed Rule 14e-5) has never been implemented even though the SEC adopted a similar prohibition with respect to an <em>issuer\u2019s </em>making such purchases within 10 days after termination of a tender offer. <em>See </em>Rule 13e-4(f)(6). Thus, the existing law does not support the prohibition urged by SCM and the SEC. We believe it would be unwise for courts judicially to usurp what is a legislative or regulatory function by substituting our judgment for that of Congress or the SEC.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-8\">In recognition of Congress\u2019 desire in enacting the Williams Act to avoid favoring either existing corporate management or outsiders seeking control through tender offers <em>{see </em>pp. 55-56, <em>supra), </em>the role of the courts in construing and applying the Act must likewise be one of strict neutrality. <em>Rondeau v. Mosinee Paper Corp., supra, </em>422 U.S. at 58-59, 95 S.Ct. at 2075-76. Although we should not hesitate to enforce the Act\u2019s disclosure provisions through appropriate relief, we must also guard against improvident or precipitous use of remedies that may have the effect of favoring one side or the other in a takeover battle when allegations of violation of the Act, often made in the heat of the contest, may not be substantiated. In this context the preliminary injunction, which is one of the most drastic tools in the arsenal of judicial remedies, <em>Medical Soc. of State of N.Y. v. Toia, </em>560 F.2d 535, 537 (2d Cir.1977) (\u201can extraordinary and drastic remedy which should not be routinely granted\u201d), must be used with great care, lest the forces of the free market place, which in the end should determine the merits of takeover disputes, are nullified.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-9\">In the present case we conclude that since the district court erred in ruling as a matter of law that SCM had demonstrated a likelihood of success on the merits, based on the theory that Hanson\u2019s post-tender offer private purchases of SCM constituted a <em>de facto </em>tender offer, it was an abuse of discretion to issue a preliminary injunction. Indeed, we do not believe that Hanson\u2019s transactions raise serious questions going to the merits that would provide a fair ground for litigation. In view of this holding it becomes unnecessary to rule upon the district court\u2019s determination that the balance of hardships tip in favor of SCM and that absent preliminary relief it would suffer irreparable injury. However, our <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>decision is not to be construed as an affirmance of the district court\u2019s resolution of these issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-5\">SCM and its stockholders may well have an adequate remedy at law. No other SCM stockholder is prevented by Hanson\u2019s acquisitions from tendering stock in response to the SCM-Merrill offer for purchase at $74 per share. Assuming that Hanson\u2019s purchases were ultimately found to violate the Williams Act, SCM stockholders deprived of their ability to realize $74 per share under the SCM-Merrill offer could recover money damages for the losses they suffered. <em>See Rondeau v. Mosinee Paper Corp., supra, </em>422 U.S. at 61, 95 S.Ct. at 2077. Furthermore, an order requiring Hanson to rescind its purchases is within the scope of relief courts may grant. <em>J.I. Case v. Borak, </em>377 U.S. 426, 433-34, 84 S.Ct. 1555, 1560-61, 12 L.Ed.2d 423 (1964). Finally, there is no evidence that any other \u201cWhite Knights\u201d or independent bidders for control of SCM stood in the wings and might have joined the bidding fray except for Hanson\u2019s purchases. On the contrary, the SCM-Merrill tender offer states that Goldman Sachs \u201cheld discussions with several potential purchasers of the Company [SCM]\u201d but that, although interest was expressed in acquiring one or more of SCM\u2019s businesses, \u201cno firm proposals were made or prices discussed ... for the Company as a whole, other than the proposal [by Merrill] for the leveraged buyout of the Company described below.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b181-6\">The order of the district court is reversed, the preliminary injunction against Hanson is vacated, and the case is remanded for further proceedings in accordance with this opinion.
