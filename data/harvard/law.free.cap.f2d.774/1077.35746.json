(Load-It) appeals the district court\u2019s decision that Volvo of America Corp. (VTCC) perfected its security interest in nine Volvo tractors, the subjects of a Master Lease. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1198-6\">On May 10, 1982, Load-It, as assignee of Elkay, Inc., entered into a Master Lease Agreement with VTCC. Pursuant to that agreement, Load-It agreed to lease nine Volvo tractors from VTCC. The state of Georgia issued a certificate of title for each of the nine tractors. Each certificate showed VTCC as owner, with VTCC\u2019s address. The certificates reflect no liens or security interests against the vehicles.</p>\n<p id=\"b1198-7\">On February 8, 1984, Load-It filed a Chapter 11 petition in the bankruptcy court. Subsequent to VTCC\u2019s motion for relief from the automatic stay provisions of the bankruptcy code, VTCC and Load-It agreed that \u201cVTCC would be entitled to dispose of the tractors and to retain the proceeds, subject to [Load-It\u2019s] challenge to the lease.\u201d The bankruptcy court found that the Master Lease Agreement was intended as security. Consequently, the bankruptcy court, interpreting Georgia law as requiring substantial compliance with the perfection of security interests statutes, found that VTCC had substantially complied. In this appeal, Load-It asserts that VTCC\u2019s security interest in the Volvo tractors is voidable because VTCC\u2019s security interests were not perfected by the issuance of certificates of titles to the vehicles; the certificates of title identified VTCC as \u201cowner\u201d of the vehicles while reflecting no interest of Load-It in the vehicles.</p>\n<p id=\"b1198-17\">Several courts have addressed the question of whether a lease agreement evidenced by a certificate of title in which the lessor is denominated the \u201cowner\u201d and where there is no express identification of the \u201cowner\u2019s\u201d security interest constitutes a perfected security interest under a state perfection of security interest statute. The lead case in this area is <em>In Re Circus Time, </em>641 F.2d 39 (1st Cir.1981). The First Circuit, construing the intent of the Maine and New Hampshire Uniform Motor Vehicle Certificate of Title and Anti-theft Acts held that the certificate of titles in which the secured creditor was represented on the certificates as owner instead of security holder, was adequate perfection of a security interest.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The court found that substantial compliance with the motor vehicle perfection of security interests statutes satisfied the purposes of such statutes: \u201cTo facilitate the identification of motor vehicles, the ascertainment of the owners, and the prevention of theft or fraud in their transfer.\u201d <em>In Re Circus Time, </em>641 F.2d at 44. Quoting leading commentators, the court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1198-18\">\u2018The lessor of a motor vehicle usually obtains and holds a certificate of title for the leased motor vehicle in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1079\">*1079</page-number>lessor\u2019s name. Since the \u201clessee\u201d of a motor vehicle under a lease \u201cintended as security\u201d will normally be considered the \u201cowner,\u201d it might be argued that it is the \u201clessee\u201d in such a case which is required to apply for and obtain a certificate of title. Taking the literal application of a \u201ctypical\u201d certificate of title one step further, an imaginative trustee in bankruptcy for such a \u201clessee\u201d might seek to cut off the \u201clessor\u2019s\u201d rights in the motor vehicle by arguing that the \u201clessor\u201d has not perfected its security interest by an indication on the certificate of title. Since the certificate, in this hypothetical, is in the \u201clessor\u2019s\u201d name, as owner, it would not indicate that the \u201clessor\u201d claimed a security interest in its own property. Returning to the \u201creal world,\u201d it is not likely that a court would take such a formalistic and literal approach. After all, the usual purposes of certificate of title acts <em>(e.g., </em>the prevention of theft, fraud, etc.) and the purposes of perfection (public notice of a claimed security interest) are satisfied by a certificate of title held by the lessor in its name \u2014 presumably, the \u201clessee\u201d would not be in a position to mortgage or sell the motor vehicle without the certification of title in its name.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1199-4\">1C P.

Welding of Mich., Inc., </em>17 B.R. 624 (Bankr.W.D.Mich., 1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b1199-8\">We agree with the district court that VTCC substantially complied, as was its minimal duty, with the purposes of the Georgia Title Act: notice to potential creditors of the existence of a lien upon the motor vehicle. <em>In Re Williams, </em>608 F.2d 1015, 1018 (5th Cir.1979); <em>Roberts v. International Harvester Credit Corp., </em>143 Ga.App. 206, 207, 237 S.E.2d 697 (1977). The certificates of title give clear notice that VTCC, listed as \u201cowner,\u201d has some interest in the tractors, so as to encumber any claim of complete ownership which Load-It may assert. Accordingly, we hold that VTCC\u2019s perfected interest is not voidable pursuant to 11 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 544(a)(1) and that VTCC is entitled to retain the proceeds from the sale of the tractors.</p>\n<p id=\"b1199-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1198-8\">.
