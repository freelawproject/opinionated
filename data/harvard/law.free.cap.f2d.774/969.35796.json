Appellees Kiefaber and Cash Flo Realty challenge the timeliness of the government\u2019s appeal and argue that quashing the subpoenas was an appropriate remedy for the government\u2019s illegal disclosures. We conclude that we have jurisdiction over the government\u2019s appeal, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1091-15\">PROCEDURAL AND FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b1091-16\">Appellees Kiefaber and Cash Flo Realty are targets of a federal grand jury investigation into alleged violations of the mail fraud statute, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1341 (1982). On October 18, 1983, the grand jury subpoenaed various business and financial records from appellees. Each subpoena stated that, in lieu of personal appearances before the grand jury, the appellees could turn over requested documents to Special Agent William Warren of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, or to Carl Fruge, an investigator for the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department.</p>\n<p id=\"b1091-17\">On October 31, 1983, counsel for appel-lees informed the assistant United States Attorney that he planned to file a motion to quash the three subpoenas because they authorized delivery of subpoenaed documents to local police officers and therefore were in violation of Rule 6 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. That same day, the government filed an ex parte motion in the district court for a Rule 6(e) disclosure order. The government did not inform the court that appellees challenged the validity of the subpoenas, nor did it satisfy the requirements of Rule 6(e) for disclosure of grand jury materials.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1091-18\">Nevertheless, on November 1, 1983, the district court granted the disclosure order. Appellees, unaware of the order, then moved to quash the subpoenas on the grounds that they improperly authorized disclosure of the subpoenaed documents to a local police officer. The government filed an ex parte motion for leave to withdraw the challenged subpoenas which the district court granted. The court then denied appellees' motion to quash as moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b1091-19\">In December, 1983, the grand jury issued three new subpoenas for the same records. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"972\">*972</page-number>These subpoenas authorized delivery to any special agent of the FBI in lieu of personal appearance before the grand jury, but did not allow delivery to local investigating officers. Appellees subsequently moved the district court for a protective order prohibiting the government from disclosing grand jury materials to state authorities and filed an ex parte motion for a stay of the grand jury proceeding pending a decision on their request for a protective order. The district court entered an order staying the grand jury proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b1092-4\">In its motion opposing the protective order, filed January 5, 1984, the government revealed to appellees, for the first time, the existence of the Rule 6(e) disclosure order that the court had granted in November, and confirmed that pursuant to that order, it had been turning over federal grand jury materials to state law enforcement authorities.</p>\n<p id=\"b1092-5\">In February, 1984, the district court held a hearing on appellees\u2019 motion for a protective order. In a pleading filed subsequent to the hearing, appellees requested an order quashing the subpoenas, rescinding the previously issued disclosure order, and requiring the government to retrieve records already disseminated to state officials. The government responded that if the subpoenas were enforced, there would be no further disclosures of grand jury information to state law enforcement officials.</p>\n<p id=\"b1092-6\">On April 4, 1984, the district court entered an order quashing the subpoenas and vacating the prior disclosure order.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Twenty days later the government moved for reconsideration of the district court\u2019s order quashing the subpoenas. The motion to reconsider was denied on May 23, 1984. Notice of appeal was filed on June 18,1984.</p>\n<p id=\"b1092-10\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"AbYJ\">A. <em>Jurisdiction</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1092-11\">Appellate jurisdiction in this case rests on 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3731 (1982), which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A4s\">An appeal by the United States shall lie to a court of appeals from a decision or order of a district court suppressing or excluding evidence ... in a criminal proceeding ____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1092-12\"><em>See In re Witnesses Before Special March 1980 Grand Jury, </em>729 F.2d 489, 490 n. 3 (7th Cir.1984); <em>In re Grand Jury Empanelled March 19, 1980, </em>680 F.2d 327, 329 (3d Cir.1982), <em>aff'd in part and rev\u2019d in part on other grounds, </em>465 U.S. 605, 104 S.Ct. 1237, 79 L.Ed.2d 552 (1984); <em>In re Grand Jury Subpoenas (Kent), </em>646 F.2d 963, 967 (5th Cir.1981); <em>In re Special September 1978 Grand Jury, </em>640 F.2d 49, 55 (7th Cir.1980); <em>In re Grand Jury Empanelled (Colucci), </em>597 F.2d 851, 855-57 (3d Cir.1979); <em>Nixon v. Sirica, </em>487 F.2d 700, 721 n. 100 (D.C.Cir.1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b1092-13\">Three requirements must be satisfied before the government may bring an appeal under section 3731: (1) the order must \u201csuppress or exclude\u201d evidence; (2) the evidence must be suppressed or excluded in a \u201ccriminal proceeding\u201d; and (3) the United States Attorney must certify to the district court that \u201cthe appeal is not taken for purpose of delay and that the evidence is a substantial proof of a fact material in the proceeding.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>Colucci, </em>597 F.2d at 855; 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3731. The order from which the government has appealed in this case has the practical effect of excluding appellees\u2019 records from the grand jury\u2019s deliberations. Therefore, in light of the legislative direction to construe broadly the phrase \u201csuppressing or excluding evidence,\u201d <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> we conclude that the district <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"973\">*973</page-number>court\u2019s order quashing the grand jury subpoenas constitutes an order suppressing or excluding evidence. <em>See United States v. Humphries, </em>636 F.2d 1172, 1175 (9th Cir.1980) (to determine whether order is a decision \u201csuppressing or excluding evidence\u201d within meaning of section 3731, court should \u201c \u2018focu[s] on the effect of the ruling sought to be appealed\u2019 \u201d) (quoting <em>United States v. Martin Linen Supply Co., </em>534 F.2d 585, 587 n. 3 (5th Cir.1976), <em>aff'd, </em>430 U.S. 564, 97 S.Ct. 1349, 57 L.Ed.2d 642 (1977)).</p>\n<p id=\"b1093-4\">The second requirement of section 3731 is that the order suppress or exclude evidence \u201cin a criminal proceeding.\u201d In <em>Bacon v. United States, </em>449 F.2d 933, 939-40 (9th Cir.1971), this court held that a grand jury investigation is a \u201ccriminal proceeding\u201d for purposes of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3149 and Fed.R.Crim.P. 46(b), which authorize detention of a witness with testimony material to a \u201ccriminal proceeding.\u201d Other courts to consider the status of grand jury proceedings in the context of section 3731 have held that they are \u201ccriminal proceedings.\u201d <em>See, e.g., Coined, </em>597 F.2d at 856-57; <em>United States v. Calandra, </em>455 F.2d 750, 752 (6th Cir.1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b1093-5\">The 1971 amendments to section 3731, which adopted the language \u201ccriminal proceeding\u201d in place of language from the 1968 amendment that limited appeals to orders entered in \u201cpretrial\u201d proceedings, were intended to broaden the circumstances under which the government could appeal from orders excluding evidence. <em>Coined, </em>597 F.2d at 856-57. We agree with the Sixth Circuit that \u201cthe legislative intent was to allow the government to appeal from any order of the district court suppressing evidence ... except those orders made during trial ... on an indictment or information.\u201d <em>Calandra, </em>455 F.2d at 752. Grand jury proceedings are thus criminal proceedings for purposes of section 3731.</p>\n<p id=\"b1093-6\">This court therefore has appellate jurisdiction under section 3731, which expressly provides the government with thirty days to appeal the district court\u2019s order. The government\u2019s motion for reconsideration, which was filed within that thirty-day period, is thus timely. <em>United States v. Dieter, </em>429 U.S. 6, 7-9, 97 S.Ct. 18, 19, 20, 50 L.Ed.2d 8 (1976); <em>United States v. Healy, </em>376 U.S. 75, 78, 84 S.Ct. 553, 555-56, 11 L.Ed.2d 527 (1963). The government\u2019s subsequent notice of appeal, which was filed within thirty days of the district court\u2019s denial of its motion for reconsideration, was therefore also timely. <em>See Dieter, </em>429 U.S. at 7-9, 97 S.Ct. at 19, 20; <em>United States v. Jones, </em>608 F.2d 386, 389-90 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b1093-10\">Appellees contend that <em>In re Grand Jury Proceedings (Manges), </em>745 F.2d 1250 (9th Cir.1984), compels a different result. In <em>Manges, </em>we stated that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1093-11\">We have on prior occasions treated appeals from orders concerning grand jury subpoenas as civil actions subject to the provisions of Fed.R.App.P. 4(a). We have done so only implicitly. We now make explicit the rule that such appeals are governed by the 30-or 60-day notice requirement of Fed.R.App.P. 4(a).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1093-12\">745 F.2d at 1251 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1093-13\">However, <em>Manges </em>involved an appeal by a <em>private </em>individual from an order <em>refusing </em>to quash a subpoena directed at a third party. Indeed, all the cases we relied upon in <em>Manges </em>involved appeals by <em>private </em>litigants whom district judges had ordered to testify before grand juries. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Weinberg, </em>436 F.2d 416 (9th Cir.1970). Accordingly, this court\u2019s jurisdiction in <em>Manges </em>rested exclusively on 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and jurisdiction was not available under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3731.</p>\n<p id=\"b1093-14\">In contrast, this case involves an appeal by the <em>United States </em>from an order granting a motion to suppress or exclude evidence in a criminal proceeding\u2014the grand jury proceedings against the appellees. Thus, even though under <em>Manges, </em>the pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"974\">*974</page-number>ceeding to quash the grand jury subpoenas may be characterized as \u201ccivil\u201d in nature, the requirements for appellate jurisdiction under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3731 are still satisfied in this case. Section 3731, a specific statutory provision, provides this court with jurisdiction over the government\u2019s appeal and is controlling. Its thirty-day periods for filing motions for reconsideration and notices of appeal apply. We therefore conclude that the government\u2019s motion for reconsideration and notice of appeal were timely, and that we have jurisdiction over the government\u2019s appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1094-4\">B. <em>Standard of Review</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1094-5\">The district court\u2019s exercise of its supervisory power to quash the grand jury subpoenas in this case must be reviewed for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Berberian, </em>767 F.2d 1324 (9th Cir.1985); <em>accord In re Grand Jury Matters, </em>751 F.2d 13, 16 (1st Cir.1984); <em>Margoles v. United States, </em>402 F.2d 450, 451-52 (7th Cir.1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b1094-6\">C. <em>Order to Quash Grand Jury Subpoenas</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1094-7\">A federal grand jury has the right and duty to procure every man\u2019s evidence, <em>United States v. Dionisio, </em>410 U.S. 1, 9-10, 93 S.Ct. 764, 769-70, 35 L.Ed.2d 67 (1973), and its investigative powers are necessarily broad. <em>Branzburg v. Hayes, </em>408 U.S. 665, 668, 92 S.Ct. 2646, 2650, 33 L.Ed.2d 626 (1972). A district court may exercise its supervisory power over grand jury proceedings only where necessary to deter official misconduct and protect judicial integrity. <em>United States v. McClintock, </em>748 F.2d 1278, 1285 (9th Cir.1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b1094-8\">In deciding whether the district court abused its discretion in invoking its supervisory power to quash the grand jury subpoenas, we consider three factors: (1) the egregiousness of the government misconduct, (2) whether there is a pattern of past misconduct by the particular government official; and (3) the effectiveness of available alternative sanctions. <em>Cf. United States v. McClintock, </em>748 F.2d at 1284-85 (same three factors considered when deciding whether to exercise supervisory power to dismiss indictment); <em>United States v. Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co., </em>719 F.2d 1386, 1395 (9th Cir.1983) (Norris, J., dissenting) (same).</p>\n<p id=\"b1094-10\">The government misconduct in this case was sufficiently egregious to warrant the district court\u2019s exercise of its supervisory power. The government made a concerted effort to circumvent the requirements of Rule 6(e), to conceal its violations of that rule from the appellees, and to prevent the appellees from voicing their objections to the district court. When appellees first notified the government that they objected to the subpoenas directing them to turn over their materials to either federal or local law enforcement agents, on the grounds that disclosure of those materials to local officials would violate Rule 6(e), the government sidestepped confrontation on this issue by moving ex parte in the district court for a Rule 6(e) disclosure order. In doing so, it failed to notify the district court of appellees\u2019 objections to such disclosure, and also failed to satisfy the requirements of Rule 6(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b1094-11\">Once, the government procured the disclosure order ex parte, it withdrew the offending subpoenas and replaced them with three new subpoenas, cleansed of facial invalidity. The combined effect of the disclosure order and the new subpoenas was to allow the government to accomplish exactly what the appellees had objected to, except that the fact that unlawful disclosures were occurring was concealed from the appellees, and thus protected from their challenge.</p>\n<p id=\"b1094-12\">When finally confronted with its Rule 6 violations by the district court, the government refused to acknowledge that its disclosures to local authorities were improper. Moreover, the government attempted to condition its agreement to make no further disclosures to local officials on the district court\u2019s granting of its motion to compel production of the subpoenaed materials.</p>\n<p id=\"b1095-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"975\">*975</page-number>The government\u2019s conduct abused the grand jury process and threatened the integrity of the judicial process. It was sufficiently egregious to justify the district court\u2019s exercise of its supervisory power.</p>\n<p id=\"b1095-5\">The district court\u2019s view that drastic sanctions were needed to deter future official misconduct was reasonable under the circumstances of this case. The district court was understandably disturbed by the government\u2019s refusal to acknowledge that Rule 6(e) prohibited it from making wholesale disclosure of grand jury materials to local authorities. The danger of future violations was not minimized by the government\u2019s extremely limited concession that it would make no further disclosures of grand jury information in this case if its motion to compel production was granted. We conclude that no sanction, short of stopping the flow of information to the grand jury altogether, would have brought the government to the realization that its conduct in this action was unacceptable, and would deter the government in future cases from making disclosures of grand jury materials to state authorities in violation of Rule 6(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b1095-6\">Quashing grand jury subpoenas is not the appropriate sanction for all instances of prosecutorial misconduct in the grand jury context. <em>See In re Antitrust Grand Jury Investigation, </em>714 F.2d 347 (4th Cir.1983). This remedy interferes with the grand jury process in such a fundamental way that it must be reserved for cases where the powers of the grand jury have been flagrantly abused. <em>See United States v. Dionisio, </em>410 U.S. at 16-18, 93 S.Ct. at 772-73 (courts should not intervene in grand jury process absent compelling reason). The government\u2019s conduct in this case was egregious enough, and the effectiveness of alternative sanctions questionable enough, that we cannot conclude that the district court abused its discretion when it chose that remedy. Accordingly, the district court\u2019s order is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1091-14\">. The government failed to demonstrate either a particularized need for disclosure or that disclosure would be preliminary to or in connection with a state judicial proceeding. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Crim.P. 6(e)(3)(C)(i); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Baggot, </em>463 U.S. 476, 103 S.Ct. 3164, 3167, 77 L.Ed.2d 785 (1983); <em>United States v. Sells Engineering, Inc., </em>463 U.S. 418, 103 S.Ct. 3133, 3148, 77 L.Ed.2d 743 (1983).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1092-7\"><em>. </em>The government does not challenge the district court\u2019s decision to rescind the disclosure order, since, as noted above, it failed to satisfy the requirements of Rule 6(e) for such an order. <em>See </em>footnote 1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1092-8\">.
