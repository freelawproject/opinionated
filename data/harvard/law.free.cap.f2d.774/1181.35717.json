The FLRA found that the Bureau did not commit an unfair labor practice when it failed to provide NTEU with notice and an opportunity to be present at an interview by the Bureau of a bargaining unit employee scheduled to testify on behalf of another employee at a hearing before the Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB). For the reasons set forth herein, we find the FLRA\u2019s conclusion arbitrary, capricious and contrary to law.</p>\n<p id=\"b1303-6\">I. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b1303-7\">NTEU\u2019s complaint arises out of the following facts. On December 20, 1980, James Lewis, an employee of the Bureau of Government Financial Operations, witnessed an altercation between Philip Murphy, a second Bureau employee, and his supervisor. Murphy lost his job as the result of this altercation and appealed this removal to the MSPB. Murphy designated NTEU to represent him at the MSPB hearing. NTEU also served as the exclusive representative of the bargaining unit to which Lewis and Murphy belonged.</p>\n<p id=\"b1303-8\">In preparation for the MSPB hearing, John Maus, the attorney representing the Bureau of Government Financial Operations, interviewed Lewis, who was to appear at the MSPB hearing as a witness for Murphy. Also present at the interview were Robert Johnson and Harold Howard, two labor relations specialists who were serving as co-counsel to the Bureau at the MSPB hearing. Prior to the interview, Maus directed Johnson to contact Lewis and tell him to report to Johnson\u2019s office where Maus, Johnson and Howard had already assembled. Lewis left his work area and reported to the office of the labor relations specialist. Then, in a twenty to thirty minute interview, Maus questioned Lewis extensively about the incident between Murphy and his supervisor. Maus took notes of Lewis\u2019 responses and later typed up these notes. The Bureau did not notify NTEU of the interview or give NTEU an opportunity to be present at the interview.</p>\n<p id=\"b1303-13\">NTEU filed an unfair labor practice charge<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> asserting that as the exclusive representative of the bargaining unit employees, it had a statutory right under \u00a7 7114(a)(2)(A) of the Federal Service Labor-Management Relations Statute to be present at the Bureau\u2019s interview of Lewis. Section 7114(a)(2)(A) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1303-14\">An exclusive representative of an appropriate unit in an agency shall be given the opportunity to be represented at\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"avp-dedup-1\">(A) any formal discussion between one or more representatives of the agency and one or more employees in the unit or their representatives concerning any grievance or any personnel policy or practices or other general condition of employment____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1303-16\">5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7114(a)(2)(A).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) concluded that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1184\">*1184</page-number>interview of Lewis constituted a formal discussion under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7114(a)(2)(A) because the meeting was called by management, held away from Lewis\u2019 work area in the office of a labor relations specialist, and marked by the taking of notes by a high level agency representative. Accordingly, the AU found that NTEU did have a statutory right to be represented at the interview. The FLRA reversed the ALJ\u2019s determination, finding that NTEU had no right to representation because the discussion was neither \u201cformal\u201d nor concerned \u201cany grievance or any personnel policy or practices or other general condition of employment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"A36\">The FLRA first determined that the subject matter of the interview did not concern a \u201cgrievance\u201d as that term is used in \u00a7 7114(a)(2)(A), reasoning that the term grievance did not encompass Murphy\u2019s appeal to the MSPB. It next concluded that the interview did not concern any \u201cpersonnel policy or practices\u201d because this phrase in \u00a7 7114(a)(2)(A) refers only to general rules applicable to all agency personnel, not to individualized applications of such rules. Finally, the FLRA found that the interview was not \u201cformal\u201d because the three interviewers were not in Lewis\u2019 chain of supervision and had no direct supervisory or managerial responsibilities over Lewis.</p>\n<p id=\"ASyZ\">NTEU filed a petition for review in this court, arguing that the interview concerned both a grievance and a personnel policy or practice and that the interview was sufficiently \u201cformal.\u201d We agree that the FLRA's interpretation of \u201cgrievance\u201d misconstrues the statute. We also find that the FLRA\u2019s determination that the discussion was not a formal one lacks substantial evidence on the record and is contrary to the FLRA\u2019s own precedent. These conclusions mandate a reversal of the FLRA\u2019s decision not to find an unfair labor practice. Accordingly, we remand the case to the FLRA so that it may issue an appropriate remedial order directing the Bureau to cease and desist from its unfair labor practice.</p>\n<p id=\"APxm\">jj Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"AJ0\">A. <em>The Meaning of \u201cGrievance\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"At5\">The Federal Service Labor-Management Relations Statute (FLMR), 5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 7101-7135 (1982), regulates the methods by which an employee member of a bargaining unit represented by an exclusive union representative may challenge adverse personnel decisions by his federal employer. If the challenged matter falls within the coverage of a \u201cnegotiated grievance procedure\u201d provided for by the collective bargaining agreement between the agency and the union, that grievance procedure provides the sole mechanism for resolving the disputed matter with two exceptions. <em>See </em>5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7121.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Where the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1185\">*1185</page-number>action complained of falls within the coverage of the negotiated grievance procedure but also constitutes a complaint of discrimination on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age, handicapping condition, marital status or political affiliation, the employee may elect to pursue the matter through either the collective grievance procedure or the statutory procedures for employment discrimination suits. <em>See </em>5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7121(d). Similarly, where the employee challenges a permanent or temporary reduction in grade or removal for unacceptable performance governed by 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 4303 or 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7512, then the matter may, in the discretion of the employee, be raised either under the procedures of 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7701 providing for an appeal to the MSPB or under the negotiated grievance procedure. <em>See </em>5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7121(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b1305-5\">Philip Murphy contested his removal from his job through the appellate procedure of 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7701. The FLRA concluded that Murphy\u2019s dispute did not constitute a \u201cgrievance\u201d as that term is used in the FLMR because Murphy pursued the dispute under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7701 rather than under a negotiated grievance procedure.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Thus, in the FLRA\u2019s view, the Bureau\u2019s interview of James Lewis concerned a statutory appeal rather than a \u201cgrievance\u201d and NTEU, as the exclusive representative, had no right under \u00a7 7114(a)(2)(A) to be represented at the interview.</p>\n<p id=\"b1305-12\">We find the FLRA\u2019s construction of \u201cgrievance\u201d to be contrary to the plain language of the statute. Section 7103 of the FLMR defines a grievance as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AOZM\">(a) For the purpose of this chapter\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"aap-dedup-0\">(9) \u201cgrievance\u201d means any complaint\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1305-13\">(A) by any employee concerning any matter relating to the employment of the employee____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1306-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1186\">*1186</page-number>Nothing in this definition restricts a \u201cgrievance\u201d to matters raised through a negotiated procedure. Murphy appealed to the MSPB contending that the Bureau improperly fired him because his conduct did not rise to a level of <em>unacceptable </em>job performance as required for removal of a federal employee by <em>5 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 4303. Murphy\u2019s appeal to the MSPB thus meets the statutory definition of a grievance as an employee \u201ccomplaint\u201d concerning a \u201cmatter relating to [his] employment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1306-4\">Section 7114 guarantees NTEU, as the exclusive representative, the right to be represented at any formal discussion between an employee and an agency representative concerning Murphy\u2019s grievance.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> That Murphy\u2019s grievance challenges an individualized discharge for alleged insubordination does not alter NTEU\u2019s right of representation. While the FLRA may be correct in its assertion that the phrase \u201cany personnel policy or practices\u201d in \u00a7 7114 is limited to those discussions which concern conditions of employment affecting unit employees generally,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> the term \u201cgrievance\u201d in \u00a7 7114 is not similarly restricted. In the sectional analysis of the \u201cUdall Substitute\u201d which eventually became the present \u00a7 7114, Representative Udall explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1306-5\">By inserting the word \u201cgeneral\u201d before \u201cconditions of employment,\u201d the substitute limits the right of representation to those formal discussions <em>(other than grievance discussions) </em>which concern conditions of employment affecting employees in the unit generally.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1306-12\">A grievance discussion, unlike a discussion of a personnel policy or practice, may involve a particularized application of a personnel policy to an employee.</p>\n<p id=\"b1306-13\">The FLRA points to \u00a7 7121 of the FLMR and to its legislative history to support its contention that the term grievance in \u00a7 7114(a)(2)(A) refers only to grievances actually pursued under a negotiated grievance procedure and not to complaints pursued through other statutory procedures. The FLRA\u2019s argument, as we understand it, is as follows. In the FLMR, Congress has provided that a negotiated grievance procedure generally will be the exclusive procedure for resolving those disputes which fall within its coverage. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7121(a). However, in \u00a7 7121(d) and (e) of the FLMR, Congress created two exceptions to this exclusive coverage. Congress thereby ensured that any employee suffering a prohibited form of discrimination under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 2302(b)(1)<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> or challenging serious disciplinary measures imposed for unacceptable job performance could avoid the collective grievance procedure and seek relief under certain alternative statutory procedures, including an appeal to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1187\">*1187</page-number>MSPB. While \u00a7 7121(b)(3) of the FLMR requires that an employee must either be his own representative or select the union as his representative when pursuing a negotiated grievance procedure, \u00a7 7114(a)(5)(A) of the FLMR guarantees that an employee seeking relief through a procedure other than the negotiated grievance procedure need not be represented by the union.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> By permitting an employee to select his own representative when pursuing relief outside the negotiated grievance procedures, Congress must have intended to exclude the union from any right of inclusion in the statutory alternatives to the negotiated grievance procedure guaranteed in \u00a7 7121(d) and (e). Consequently, the union on its own behalf should have no right of representation when an employee and an agency representative discuss the subject matter of a dispute pursued through these alternative statutory procedures. To support this reading of the FLMR, the FLRA relies on a statement in the House Report that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Atl\">It should be noted that, although this subsection [\u00a7 7103(a)(9)] is virtually all-inclusive in defining \u201cgrievance,\u201d section 7121 excludes certain grievances from being processed under a negotiated grievance procedure, thereby limiting the net effect of the term.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"Aanf\">In light of the structure of \u00a7 7121, which requires an employee to choose between two overlapping remedies, we read this sentence from the House Report not as a statement scaling back the rights of an exclusive representative to be represented at formal discussions concerning grievances but rather as a guarantee that an agency employer will not be forced to defend its challenged conduct in both a statutory procedure and a negotiated grievance procedure. Absent some more positive indication that Congress in fact meant in all circumstances to exclude the union from any formal discussion of matters raised in the alternative statutory procedures guaranteed in \u00a7 7121(d) and (e), we reject the FLRA\u2019s attempt to read the distinctions drawn in \u00a7 7121 back into the original definition of grievance provided in \u00a7 7103(a)(9). Such a reading of \u201cgrievance\u201d strains the language of the statute at every turn. For example, if the term \u201cgrievance\u201d referred only to disputes pursued through negotiated grievance procedures, \u00a7 7121(d) and (e) would not be worded to require an <em>\u201caggrieved </em>employee\u201d (emphasis supplied) to elect to pursue a remedy under either a negotiated procedure or a statutory procedure. An \u201caggrieved <em>employee\u201d </em>\u2014 i.e., one with a grievance \u2014 -would by definition necessarily pursue his grievance under a negotiated procedure. Likewise, to read \u201cgrievance\u201d as the FLRA attempts to do would render self-contradictory \u00a7 7121(a)(1) which provides that <em>\u201cExcept </em>as provided in subsections (d) and (e) of this section, the procedures [provided by a collective bargaining agreement] shall be the exclusive procedures for resolving grievances which fall within its coverage\u201d (emphasis supplied). Section 7121(a)(1) says that the statutory procedures referred to in \u00a7 7121(d) and (e) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1188\">*1188</page-number>are also procedures for resolving <em>grievances.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1308-4\">Nor can the FLRA rely on legislative history to pare down the definition of grievance contained in \u00a7 7103(a)(9). The only plausible reading of the sentence in the House Report quoted above is that \u00a7 7121 ensures that some <em>grievances </em>cannot be processed under a negotiated procedure. The House Report merely indicates that the \u201call-inclusive\u201d definition of \u201cgrievance\u201d in \u00a7 7103(a)(9) and \u00a7 7114(a)(2)(A) is broader than the \u201ceffect\u201d of the term under \u00a7 7121. Congress was compelled to limit the \u201ceffect\u201d of the term grievance in \u00a7 7121 precisely because the broad definition of the term would otherwise include grievances brought under a statutory procedure as well as those brought under a negotiated grievance procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b1308-5\">Our interpretation of the term \u201cgrievance\u201d may differ from that of the Ninth Circuit in <em>Internal Revenue Service, Fresno Service Center, Fresno, California v. Federal Labor Relations Authority, </em>706 F.2d 1019 (9th Cir.1983). There the Court of Appeals held that 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7114(a)(2)(A) does not guarantee a union the right to representation at an Equal Employment Opportunity precomplaint conciliation conference. The Ninth Circuit\u2019s decision appears to us to be based primarily on its conclusion that the precomplaint conference did not constitute a \u201cformal\u201d discussion. <em>See </em>706 F.2d at 1023-24. To the extent, however, that the Ninth Circuit may have construed the term \u201cgrievance\u201d to include only disputes governed by a negotiated procedure, we must disagree with its interpretation for the reasons already discussed. The language and structure of the statute lead us to a different result. We also disagree with the Ninth Circuit\u2019s assumption that the union, as the exclusive bargaining representative of unit employees, has no cognizable interest in being represented when a dispute being pursued under a statutory procedure is the subject of a discussion between an employee and an agency representative. <em>See </em>706 F.2d at 1024-25. The Ninth Circuit suggests that the union\u2019s only interest in being present at a formal discussion of a grievance stems from the fact that it negotiates and plays an institutional role in the collective grievance procedure. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1308-7\">We view the interest of unions under the FLMR as potentially far broader. Section 7121 recognizes that employee complaints challenging alleged discrimination or a permanent or temporary removal for allegedly unacceptable performance will often be covered by a collective bargaining agreement as well as by statutory procedures. Double coverage is to be expected: resolution of such episodes can potentially affect all bargaining unit employees in important ways. Decisions about what constitutes an unjust dismissal or an unacceptable basis for preferring or rejecting a single employee spills over to the rights and expectations of all unit employees. Remedies for improper employer conduct, such as reinstatement or retroactive seniority, also may affect other bargaining unit employees, since a benefit or opportunity granted to one employee can mean the loss of the same benefit or opportunity for another employee. The impact of these individual complaints on the bargaining unit will be felt regardless of whether the aggrieved employee opts to pursue a negotiated grievance procedure or an alternative statutory procedure. We are therefore reluctant to follow the Ninth Circuit\u2019s suggestion in <em>IRS, Fresno Service Center </em>that the union\u2019s role in protecting the interest of the bargaining unit is inherently restricted to those situations in which an employee pursues a grievance through a negotiated grievance procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b1308-8\">Of course, recognition of a union\u2019s interest, as the representative of the bargaining unit, in the alternative statutory procedures guaranteed in \u00a7 7121(d) and (e) does not answer the question of the union\u2019s statutory role in such procedures. Under the FLMR, the union\u2019s institutional role in these statutory grievance procedures is obviously more restricted than its role in a negotiated grievance procedure. The FLMR provides that only the union may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1189\">*1189</page-number>represent an employee in a negotiated grievance procedure if the employee elects not to present the grievance himself; the statute does not similarly restrict an employee\u2019s choice of a representative outside the negotiated grievance procedure. <em>See </em>5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7114(a)(5). Nonetheless, although the union\u2019s institutional role may be restricted, we do not think it necessarily is nonexistent. In the absence of congressional intent to the contrary or any plausible alternative interpretation of the statute by the FLRA, we find that the words of \u00a7 7114(a)(2)(A), which provide that an exclusive representative has the right to be present at <em>any </em>formal discussion of a grievance between management and a bargaining unit employee, assure the union a role in the alternative procedures so long as the statutory criteria of \u00a7 7114(a)(2)(A) are met.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1309-5\">B. <em>The Formality of the Discussion</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1309-6\">1. <em>Lack of Substantial Evidence on the Record</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1309-7\">Because we find that the interview of Lewis concerned a grievance, the only remaining question is the formality of the discussion. In determining whether a discussion should be considered formal, the FLRA examines the totality of facts and circumstances presented. We find that in the present case, the FLRA\u2019s reversal of the AU\u2019s finding that the interview was formal is not supported by substantial evidence on the record and constitutes an unexplained departure from agency precedent.</p>\n<p id=\"b1309-10\">The FLRA\u2019s conclusion that the interview was not formal runs counter to the undisputed evidence. The ALJ found, and the FLRA does not dispute, that the meeting was initiated by management; it was held away from Lewis\u2019 normal work area, lasted twenty to thirty minutes, and was marked by the taking of notes by a \u201chigh level\u201d management representative. The FLRA concluded that these undisputed indicia of formality were outweighed by the fact that none of the interviewers were in Lewis\u2019 chain of supervision.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The FLRA also cites as support for its conclusion the lack of a \u201cclear\u201d finding that Lewis\u2019 presence was mandatory and the lack of evidence on the record of any advance notice <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1190\">*1190</page-number>of the meeting or any formal agenda distributed in advance of the meeting.</p>\n<p id=\"b1310-4\">Previous FLRA cases have relied on lack of advance notice and distributed agenda as indications that a meeting was spontaneous and therefore unlikely to be \u201cformal.\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> These factors, however, do not always correlate with spontaneity and thus mere absence of notice or an agenda will not necessarily indicate that a meeting is not \u201cformal.\u201d In fact, the available evidence in this record indicates the contrary conclusion: that the interview of Lewis was planned in advance. For an attorney and two labor relations specialists to meet at the office of one of the labor relations specialists and in a single day interview <em>all </em>of the witnesses to be called at an MSPB hearing surely indicates some advance preparation. <em>Cf. Office of Program Operations, Field Operations, Social Security Administration, </em>9 F.L.R.A. at 50 (refusing to find formal meeting where district manager was at the office on other business and not as a consequence of any advance arrangements). Lack of notice and formal agenda, therefore, offer negligible evidence of informality, since the inference that these factors are sufficient to support, <em>i.e., </em>that the interview <em>might </em>have been an impromptu gathering, is directly contradicted by more powerful evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1310-5\">The lack of a clear finding that Lewis\u2019 continued presence at the interview was mandatory is similarly not controlling as to informality. The evidence concerning what the interviewers told Lewis at the start of the interview is contradictory, and the AU never resolved the question of the compulsory nature of the interview. <em>Cf. </em>13 F.L.R.A. 27, 31 n. 1. Where an employee interview is characterized by strong indicators of formality, such as the fact that an employee was summoned to a meeting initiated by three management representatives and held on management\u2019s terrain, an asserted lack of clear evidence on a single disputed point such as whether the \u201ccontinued\u201d presence of the employee was compulsory cannot carry the day for the agency. This is especially true where the FLRA has declined to offer its own assessment of the credibility of the witnesses or to find that Lewis\u2019 presence was in fact <em>not </em>compulsory.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1310-8\">Finally, the FLRA does not explain why the fact that the interviewers were not in Lewis\u2019 direct chain of supervision outweighs the fact that the interviewers were nonetheless management representatives. The focus of prior FLRA decisions has been on whether management representatives attended a discussion. Thus, personnel specialists who addressed employees at an orientation session were considered representatives of the agency and the FLRA found the meeting to be a formal one. <em>See Department of HEW, Region IV, Atlanta, Ga. and National Treasury Employees Union, 5 </em>F.L.R.A. 458, 460 (1981). Prior FLRA cases have not required a showing that the agency representatives were within the employee\u2019s chain of supervision. <em>See Internal Revenue Service and National Treasury Employees Union, </em>11 F.L.R.A. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1191\">*1191</page-number>69, 71 (1983) (finding a formal discussion between employees and members of a task force composed of managerial and supervisory officials where \u201cNo task force member interviewed any employee from his own district.\u201d), <em>aff'd mem. sub nom. National Treasury Employees Union v. Federal Labor Relations Authority, </em>725 F.2d 126 (D.C.Cir.1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b1311-4\">The Authority considered the totality of facts and circumstances and concluded that the interview of Lewis was not formal in nature. We find this conclusion unsupported by substantial evidence on the record as a whole. Where a discussion to which management summoned an employee is attended by three management representatives, at least one of whom has some responsibilities in the disciplinary process,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> is held away from the employee\u2019s work station in the office of that management representative, lasts for twenty to thirty minutes, and is marked by the taking of notes, the fact that the management representatives are not in an employee\u2019s direct chain of supervision does not outweigh or sufficiently negate the other evidence of formality. Therefore, we find the record as a whole does not support the FLRA\u2019s conclusion to the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b1311-11\">2. <em>Departure From Agency Precedent</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1311-12\">The FLRA\u2019s conclusion that the Bureau\u2019s interview of Lewis was not a formal discussion is also contrary to decisions of the Assistant Secretary for Labor-Management Relations interpreting Section 10(e) of Executive Order 11491, the predecessor to \u00a7 7114(a)(2)(A). Section 10(e) of Executive Order 11491 was carried over into \u00a7 7114(a)(2)(A) with no significant changes.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> In <em>United States Air Force, McClellan Air Force Base, California, </em>A/SLMR No. 830, 7 A/SLMR 350 (1977), and again in <em>Internal Revenue Service, South Carolina District, </em>A/SLMR No. 1172, 8 A/SLMR 1370 (1978), the Assistant Secretary for Labor-Management Relations concluded that an interview by the agency of bargaining unit employees expected to appear as witnesses for a grievant at an arbitration hearing constituted a formal discussion at which the union had a right to be represented under \u00a7 10(e). Both decisions turned on a determination that an interview of a witness was a \u201cformal\u201d discussion.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> The other indicia of formality in these two cases also resembled those of the present case, except that only in the present case did more than one management representative attend the interview. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1192\">*1192</page-number>In <em>McClellan, </em>the attorney representing the agency asked the personnel office to request the employee witnesses to come to his office the next morning. The attorney interviewed the employees at 8 a.m., a few hours before the scheduled arbitration hearing. In <em>IRS, South Carolina District, </em>the employee witness was told by his group manager that the attorney representing the agency would like to talk with him; the interview between the employee and the attorney took place later in the month.</p>\n<p id=\"b1312-4\">The decisions of the Assistant Secretary construing \u00a7 10(e) were incorporated into the Federal Service Labor-Management Relations Statute by the grandfather provision of \u00a7 7135(b). Section 7135(b) of the FLMR provides that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ASh0\">Policies, regulations, and procedures established under and decisions issued under Executive Order[ ] 11491 ... shall remain in full force and effect until revised or revoked by the President, or unless superseded by specific provisions of this chapter or by regulations or decisions issued pursuant to this chapter.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AZ1l\">While \u00a7 7135(b) does not bar the FLRA from reevaluating the decisions of the Assistant Secretary, \u00a7 7135(b) requires the FLRA to treat those decisions as being in full force until it undertakes such a reevaluation. Where, as here, the Congress adopted the provision in the Executive Order in virtually unchanged form and nothing in the legislative history suggests any congressional dissatisfaction with the prior application or interpretation of the provision, we would assume \u00a7 7135(b) requires the FLRA to treat the administrative precedent with the same deference as it would treat its own prior FLRA decisions. At a minimum, the FLRA must acknowledge the precedent and provide a reason for departure, just as it must when it reappraises its own precedent. <em>Cf. Baltimore and Annapolis Railroad Co. v. Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Commission, </em>642 F.2d 1365, 1370 (D.C.Cir.1980) (agency must justify a departure from its prior determinations); <em>Greater Boston Television Corp. v. FCC, </em>444 F.2d 841, 852 (D.C.Cir.1970) (\u201cagency changing its course must supply a reasoned analysis indicating that prior policies and standards are being deliberately changed, not casually ignored\u201d), cer<em>t. denied, </em>403 U.S. 923, 91 S.Ct. 2233, 29 L.Ed.2d 701 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b1312-6\">The reference in the FLRA\u2019s decision to <em>Internal Revenue Service and Brookha-ven Service Center and National Treasury Employees Union, Chapter 99 (Brookhaven), </em>9 F.L.R.A. 930 (1982), does not constitute the reasoned analysis which the law requires for the FLRA\u2019s departure from the policy set forth in the Assistant Secretary's decisions in <em>McClellan Air Force Base </em>and <em>IRS, South Carolina District. </em>In the first place, <em>Brookhaven </em>never discusses <em>McClellan Air Force Base </em>or <em>IRS, South Carolina District </em>or provides any reason for departing from them. More importantly, however, we do not find <em>Brookhaven </em>inconsistent with these two prior cases. In <em>Brookhaven, </em>the FLRA found that an agency interview of two bargaining unit employees whom the agency intended to call as its own \u201cmajor witnesses\u201d in an upcoming arbitration hearing was not a \u201cformal\u201d discussion. The FLRA also determined that the agency\u2019s interview of a bargaining unit employee in preparation for an upcoming unfair labor practice proceeding where that employee was not to appear as a witness did not constitute a \u201cformal\u201d discussion. <em>Brookhaven, </em>when read in conjunction with <em>McClellan </em>and <em>IRS, South Carolina District, </em>suggests that a formal discussion is more likely to be found where an agency interviews the witnesses of its opponent than when it interviews its own witnesses or conducts background fact gathering, even if other indicia of formality are similar.</p>\n<p id=\"b1312-7\">When an employer interviews an adverse witness rather than his own or even a neutral witness, common sense suggests that the situation carries a greater potential for intimidation or coercion. In assessing formality under \u00a7 7114(a)(2)(A), the FLRA has always considered the potential coerciveness of the encounter. Factors frequently cited by the FLRA as militating <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1193\">*1193</page-number>toward a finding of formality, such as mandatory attendance or the number of supervisors present, .focus on the confrontational potential of the interview, or at least the perception thereof. <em>Brookhaven, </em>along with <em>McClellan Air Force Base </em>and <em>IRS, South Carolina District, </em>are thus relevant in assessing the coerciveness component of formality. In the present case, the FLRA disregarded its own precedent bearing on the important element of formality supplied by the fact that the Bureau interviewed an adverse witness. Such a departure from precedent, and apparent refusal to consider a relevant factor, requires some word of justification.</p>\n<p id=\"b1313-5\">III. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b1313-6\">We conclude that an appeal to the MSPB challenging a dismissal for unacceptable job performance constitutes a grievance as that term is used in the Federal Service Labor-Management Relations Statute. We also find that the FLRA\u2019s determination that the interview of Lewis was not formal represents an unexplained departure from administrative precedent and is not supported by substantial evidence on the record as a whole. We therefore reverse the FLRA\u2019s decision to dismiss NTEU\u2019s unfair labor practice complaint and remand this case to the FLRA so that it may issue an appropriate order directing the Bureau of Government Financial Operations of the Department of Treasury to cease and desist from its unfair labor practice.</p>\n<p id=\"b1313-7\">\n<em>Reversed and Remanded,</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1303-9\">. <em>Bureau of Gov\u2019t Fin.

This case does not require us to decide what the union\u2019s rights would be where an employee opts to pursue a grievance outside of the negotiated grievance procedure because the union thinks that prosecution of this specific grievance is not in the interest of the bargaining unit as a whole. In the present case, Murphy requested NTEU to represent him at the MSPB hearing, and NTEU accepted. We do note, however, that in the case of grievances arising out of alleged discrimination on the basis of race, religion, sex or national origin, Congress has explicitly decided that a conflict between the rights of identifiable victims of discrimination and the interests of the bargaining unit must be resolved in favor of the former. Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e <em>et seq., </em>provides that the right of an aggrieved employee to complete relief takes priority over the general interests of the bargaining unit. <em>See, e.g., Franks v.

Similarly, a <em>direct </em>conflict between the rights of an exclusive representative under \u00a7 7114(a)(2)(A) and the <em>rights </em>of an employee victim of discrimination should also presumably be resolved in favor of the latter. <em>Cf.

In disagreeing with the Judge\u2019s conclusion that the meeting in question was formal in nature, the Authority notes particularly that the meeting in question was called by staff specialists who did not have any supervisory or managerial responsibility over the employee being interviewed; that the meeting was held in a staff specialist\u2019s office and not in the office of anyone in the employee\u2019s chain of supervision and no one in that chain attended the meeting; and that there was no clear finding that Lewis\u2019 continued presence at the meeting was mandatory.
