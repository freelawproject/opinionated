WINTER, Chief Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b1384-8\">This appeal challenges the final power marketing policy of the Southeastern Power Administration (SEPA), a federal power marketing agency within the Department of Energy. Plaintiffs, various municipally-owned electric systems in North Carolina, South Carolina, and Virginia, along with the Cities of Bennettsville and Camden, South Carolina (collectively referred to herein as \u201cElectricities\u201d), brought this action in the district court for review of SEPA\u2019s final power marketing policy for its Georgia-Alabama system of projects. On cross-motions for summary judgment the district court granted defendants\u2019 motion on the alternative grounds that SEPA\u2019s actions were nonreviewable because \u201ccommitted to agency discretion by law,\u201d or that SEPA\u2019s policy, even if subject to the district court\u2019s jurisdiction, was not arbitrary, capricious, or an abuse of discretion. Because we perceive no merit in plaintiffs\u2019 appeal, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1384-12\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1384-13\">Under the authority of Section 5 of the Flood Control Act of 1944, 16 U.S.C. \u00a7 825s, SEPA sells power produced at federal dams to energy consumers.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The Act requires that SEPA, as delegate of the Secretary of Energy, dispose of the power produced \u201cin such manner as to encourage the most widespread use thereof at the lowest possible rates to consumers consistent with sound business principles.\u201d <em>Id. </em>It further requires that preference in the sale of power be given to public bodies and cooperatives, rather than to private entities.</p>\n<p id=\"b1384-14\">SEPA sells power in a ten-state area, which it has divided into four marketing areas. This appeal involves the final power marketing policy for the Georgia-Alabama system, which includes parts of Georgia, Alabama, South Carolina, North Carolina, Florida, and Mississippi.</p>\n<p id=\"b1384-15\">SEPA does not own or control any transmission lines. It must depend on others to move the output of its generating facilities to its customers. Also, SEPA supplies only a small part of the needs of its customers. In 1978, its generating capacity amounted to only 21% of the capacity and 10% of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1265\">*1265</page-number>average annual energy of the load of its preference customers in the Georgia-Alabama marketing area. Thus, the demand for power generated by it far exceeds the supply. The power that it sells from the Georgia-Alabama system is \u201cpeaking\u201d power, that is, power to meet the peak demands of its customers.</p>\n<p id=\"b1385-4\">The availability of peaking power from SEPA eliminates the need on the part of its customers to invest in generation facilities to meet the demands for energy made on them during peak periods.</p>\n<p id=\"b1385-5\">Prior to 1978, SEPA marketed power from its Georgia-Alabama system on an ad hoc basis by negotiating contracts with consumers. In 1978, SEPA adopted a formal procedure for establishing its marketing policies. 43 Fed.Reg. 29186 (1978). Under the new procedure SEPA develops its marketing policies by informal rulemak-ing with notice and an opportunity to submit comments.</p>\n<p id=\"b1385-6\">Pursuant to this new procedure SEPA issued a notice of intent to formulate a power marketing policy for the Georgia-Alabama system in 1979. 44 Fed.Reg. 10111 (1979). SEPA received seventy-eight responses to the notice, including written comments from Electricities. Electricities proposed that once existing contracts for power expired, SEPA should allocate to all interested preference entities proportionately equal allocations.</p>\n<p id=\"b1385-8\">After the comment period SEPA published a notice of proposed marketing policy for the Georgia-Alabama system. 44 Fed. Reg. 59642 (1979). SEPA subsequently held two public comment fora concerning the proposed policy in January 1980. SEPA received further oral and written comments on its proposed marketing policy, including additional comments from Electricities.</p>\n<p id=\"b1385-9\">On October 1, 1980, SEPA published its notice of the issuance of the Final Power Marketing Policy. The final marketing policy expanded the list of preference customers that would receive some allocation of SEPA power from 150 to 204. Among the added preference customers are several cities that had previously refused SEPA power including several plaintiff cities. Although the final marketing policy expanded the list of preference customers, it also provided that SEPA\u2019s pre-existing customers would continue to receive their existing allocations of power after their contracts expired. New customers would only receive power as it became available after the completion of the Richard B. Russell project and the expansion of the Hartwell project both along the Savannah River on the Georgia-South Carolina border. Old and new customers would share the new power proportionately.</p>\n<p id=\"b1385-11\">In its final marketing policy, SEPA also divided the Georgia-Alabama marketing area into two parts with the Savannah River serving as the boundary between the parts. Customers in the portion of the Georgia-Alabama marketing area that is east of the Savannah River would receive their power from the three projects located on that river. The final marketing policy provided that the eastern portion of the Georgia-Alabama area would consist of the South Carolina Public Service Authority\u2019s and South Carolina Electric and Gas Company\u2019s service areas and only that part of the Duke Power Company\u2019s service area that was within a radius of 150 miles of the Savannah River projects.</p>\n<p id=\"b1385-12\">Plaintiffs challenged the marketing policy on several grounds. Most important upon appeal are plaintiffs\u2019 contentions that SEPA\u2019s decisions to treat existing customers preferentially and to exclude potential customers situated more than 150 miles from the Savannah River project are arbitrary and capricious, constitute an abuse of discretion, and are in violation of the Flood Control Act of 1944.</p>\n<p id=\"b1385-13\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1385-14\">In granting defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment, the district court first ruled that allocation of power among preference customers is a matter \u201ccommitted to agency discretion by law\u201d and therefore not subject to judicial review. 5 U.S.C. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1266\">*1266</page-number>\u00a7 701(a)(2). The district court concluded that the Act\u2019s command to dispose of power \u201cin such a manner as to encourage the most widespread use thereof\u201d was \u201csimply too vague to supply this Court with a standard by which it can judge the propriety of SEPA\u2019s actions.\u201d It agreed with the Ninth Circuit that the Act\u2019s \u201cmost widespread use\u201d language does not provide a standard against which to measure SEPA\u2019s marketing decisions, since the language is susceptible to a wide range of divergent interpretations. <em>Santa Clara v. Andrus, </em>572 F.2d 660, 668 (9 Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>439 U.S. 859, 99 S.Ct. 177, 58 L.Ed.2d 167 (1978); <em>see also Greenwood Utilities Commission v. Hodel, </em>764 F.2d 1459, 1464-65 (11 Cir.1985) (holding that section 5 of the Flood Control Act of 1944 provides no law to apply regarding allocation decisions among preference customers). The district court therefore decided that it had no jurisdiction to review SEPA\u2019s decision regarding the marketing of power to preference customers.</p>\n<p id=\"b1386-4\">We agree with the district court. Agency actions are presumptively subject to judicial review except where Congress manifests its intent to preclude such review. <em>Abbott Laboratories v. Gardner, </em>387 U.S. 136, 140-41, 87 S.Ct. 1507, 1510-11, 18 L.Ed.2d 681 (1967); <em>but see Heckler v. Chaney, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 105 S.Ct. 1649, 84 L.Ed.2d 714 (1985) (agency nonenforcement decisions presumptively nonreviewable). However, the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) provides that agency action is nonreviewable if it is \u201ccommitted to agency discretion by law.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 701(a)(2). The exception is narrow. It applies only \u201cin those rare instances \u2018where statutes are drawn in such broad terms that in a given case there is no law to apply.\u2019 \u201d <em>Citizens to Preserve Overton Park, Inc. v. Volpe, </em>401 U.S. 402, 410, 91 S.Ct. 814, 820, 28 L.Ed.2d 136 (1971) (quoting legislative history of the APA, S.Rep. No. 752, 79th Cong., 1st Sess., 26 (1945)). Despite harsh criticism of the no-law-to-apply doctrine, the Supreme Court has reaffirmed the doctrine in <em>Heckler v. Chaney, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 105 S.Ct. 1649, 84 L.Ed.2d 714 (1985).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1386-11\">We agree with the district court that the phrase \u201cmost widespread use\u201d does not limit SEPA\u2019s discretion to act in the manner which is challenged by plaintiffs and thus, in this case, there is no law to apply. Like the district court and the Ninth and Eleventh Circuits we conclude that taken on its own terms the statutory language is too vague to provide a standard by which a court can review SEPA\u2019s decisions. As the Ninth Circuit has noted, the phrase \u201cmost widespread use\u201d might mean most geographically widespread distribution of power, distribution to the most diversified mix of ultimate consumers, or distribution to preference customers that reach the greatest number of ultimate consumers. <em>Santa Clara, </em>572 F.2d at 668. Nor do the scant references in the legislative history and in contemporaneous administrative materials to the Act\u2019s provision for power marketing help plaintiffs. At most we are able to glean from these materials a congressional purpose to avert monopolization of power<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and to foster the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1267\">*1267</page-number>general goals of rural electrification.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Neither purpose supplies law to apply in this particular case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1387-4\">We are, of course, mindful of the Supreme Court\u2019s warning that instances of agency action that fall within the Section 701(a)(2) exception of the APA thereby escaping judicial review are rare. Nonetheless, we think the conclusion inescapable that SEPA\u2019s marketing decisions among preference customers under Section 5 of the Flood Control Act of 1944 are \u201ccommitted to agency discretion by law.\u201d We therefore conclude that the district court properly held that it had no jurisdiction to review SEPA\u2019s allocation decisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1387-5\">It is, of course, true that \u201cagency action [which] is committed to agency discretion by law\u201d is not completely shielded from judicial review. Most recently, Justice Brennan stated in his concurring opinion in <em>Chaney </em>that courts may review agency actions for certain types of errors that fall within the APA\u2019s Section 701(a)(2) exception to judicial review. For example, an agency decision that violates a statutory or constitutional command or is prompted by a bribe is not immune from judicial review even when a lawful exercise of an agency\u2019s discretion has that immunity. <em>Chaney, </em>\u2014 U.S. at \u2014, 105 S.Ct. at 1659-60 (Brennan, J., concurring). In <em>Garcia v. Neagle, </em>660 F.2d 983, 988 (4 Cir.1981), cert. <em>denied, </em>454 U.S. 1153, 102 S.Ct. 1023, 71 L.Ed.2d 309 (1982), we similarly said that \u201ceven where action is committed to absolute agency discretion by law, courts have assumed the power to review allegations that an agency exceeded its legal authority, acted unconstitutionally, or failed to follow its own regulations,\u201d but they \u201cmay not review agency action where the challenge is only to the decision itself.\u201d <em>See also Ness Investment Corp. v. United States Department of Agriculture, </em>512 F.2d 706, 714 (9 Cir.1975); <em>Scanwell Laboratories, Inc. v. Shaffer, </em>424 F.2d 859, 874 (D.C.Cir.1970); 5 K. Davis, Administrative Law Treatise \u00a7 28.2 (2d ed. 1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b1387-13\">On this basis, plaintiffs also challenge the marketing policy, contending that in developing the policy SEPA improperly considered existing customers\u2019 prior political support for SEPA and for funding of Federal power projects. Even where an agency\u2019s action is committed to the agency\u2019s discretion, a court should hear a claim that an agency rested an action on \u201cconsiderations that Congress could not have intended to make relevant\u201d such as the political considerations alleged by plaintiffs. <em>Littell v. Morton, </em>445 F.2d 1207 (4 Cir.1971) (quoting <em>Wong Wing Hang v. INS, </em>360 F.2d 715, 719 (2 Cir.1966)).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> While the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1268\">*1268</page-number>district court failed to address this part of plaintiffs\u2019 claim, our review of the record persuades us that it is lacking in merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b1388-4\">To show improper political influence, plaintiffs rely on two documents contained in the record and the testimony of the Administrator of SEPA given at the Public Comment Forum held on January 10, 1980. We consider this evidence seriatim.</p>\n<p id=\"b1388-5\">The first reference is to language contained in the document entitled \u201cPower Marketing Policy Considerations\u201d prepared by SEPA and dated October 1977. In pertinent part, the document discussed treatment of existing customers and proceeded from the premise that if all potential customers were on an equal footing the allocation of existing power would normally be in relation to the magnitude of their power loads. However, the report continued, not all potential customers are on equal footing; some were then purchasing power and desired to purchase more; some initially declined to purchase power but desire to purchase now; some are outside of SEPA\u2019s selected marketing area and have not been offered the opportunity to purchase power. Since existing customers now purchase all of the available energy, any allocation to any of the other two groups would take power away from existing customers. Then, with regard to existing customers, the report stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1388-6\">In general these customers are well organized and have supported the Federal power program over a long period of time. In many cases they have actually championed the projects and were instrumental in obtaining congressional authorization and funding of the projects. It is believed that these customers and their political representatives will be extremely vocal and will resist to the utmost the adoption of any power allocation procedure which provides that some power which they now purchase will be taken away and sold to others.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1388-10\">Immediately following this statement, the report said, with respect to the other two classes of potential customers:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1388-11\">On the other hand potential customers in groups 2 and 3 are adamant that they will receive an allocation of power at the earliest possible moment. One possible consideration is the development of an expanded power product made possible by purchasing energy from the private utilities in sufficient quantities so that this energy together with the project capacity now sold to the private utilities would provide an additional Federal power supply available for sale to preference customers.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1388-12\">The second document, dated April 30, 1980, is the written staff response to statements made by customers and potential customers at the public fora and the pertinent portion is the staff comment to the suggestion that all preference entities should receive an allocation of power and \u201cthere should be no different treatment accorded existing preference customers over preference entities not now served [with certain exceptions not pertinent here].\u201d The staff response was that SEPA\u2019s resources, even projected to the completion of new facilities in 1985, could meet only 6% of the capacity requirements <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1269\">*1269</page-number>and less than 5% of the energy requirements of preference entities in the merged marketing area; that \u201c[s]ince its creation in 1950, SEPA has progressively enlarged its marketing areas and increased the number of preference customers served [but] [o]nce a supplier-customer relationship was established, SEPA has never unilaterally terminated such a relationship [nor] has SEPA ever reduced an allocation once established.\u201d The report then stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1389-4\">The advocates of ultimate equal treatment as far as existing power is concerned and exclusive interim rights to new power sources knowingly take a very provocative position. These public bodies are not only located remote from the power sources, old or new, but have shown little or no support or interest in development of these power sources while many of the existing customers have been longtime proponents of the projects giving of themselves and their treasure in bringing the resource development to fruition. It would appear that an appropriate course of action for these remotely located public entities to pursue, if they desire Federal projects to be a source of power supply for them, would be to become active in the location, promotion, authorization and construction of such projects. The National Hy-dropower Study is presently underway for the express purpose of identifying potential new projects. It is the price that others have paid.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1389-5\">Staff Evaluation Committee, Staff Evaluation of Proposed Power Marketing Policy, Georgia-Alabama System of Projects at 6 (April 30, 1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b1389-6\">The testimony was that of Harry F. Wright, Administrator of SEPA, given at the Public Comment Forum held on January 10, 1980. There, in the course of questioning about the proposed policy, the following was elicited:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1389-7\">MR. HORWOOD: I guess my question is, was there past support for the Federal Power Marketing Program and SEPA a factor that was considered or was it a factor that was basically ignored?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1389-9\">MR. WRIGHT: Well, I think we tried to consider all of the factors. I mean, you can\u2019t just say everything is ignored, and it\u2019s hard to say that because of this factor we made this decision. But, of course, that is a claim, and, I guess the fact that some of the preference customers have, in the past, substantially supported the projects and, as a result of that, they think they do have a right to the power, that is one factor that\u2019s considered as well as others.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1389-10\">MR. BELL [General Counsel of SEPA and Forum Chairman]: I\u2019ll add this, Mr. Horwood, though. We have offered power to customers who have offered no support to us at all, including customers in North Carolina.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1389-11\">We cannot read this evidence as supporting a charge of improper political influence. At most, it is a combination of two factors. First, it is a recognition that if the proposal advanced by some potential customers that allocations of power to existing customers be reduced, there would be vigorous opposition and recriminations from existing customers. Second, it is recognition of the validity of a marketing approach employed widely in private business, namely, that an existing customer, as a result of its past custom, is entitled to protection if not preferential treatment with regard to future business. Indeed, the latter had been the policy of SEPA for over thirty years, and .we see nothing wrong in the continuation of that policy, least of all that it constitutes evidence of a tainting, improper political influence. Thus, we hold that the evidence of improper political influence is insufficient as a matter of law to warrant consideration of it by the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1389-12\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b1389-13\">Because the district court properly held that SEPA\u2019s allocation decisions among preference customers was committed to agency discretion by law, and there<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1270\">*1270</page-number>fore not subject to judicial review, it was unnecessary for the district court to measure SEPA\u2019s marketing policy against the standard of review set forth in 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706(2)(a).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> We therefore need not discuss the district court\u2019s alternative holding in detail. We are persuaded by the district court\u2019s reasoning, however, and agree with it that even under this standard of review, SEPA\u2019s policy is neither unlawful nor invalid. Because the \u201cmost widespread use\u201d language is subject to divergent meanings we cannot say that SEPA\u2019s policy fails to accord with the Flood Control Act of 1944. Nor did SEPA abuse its discretion or act in an arbitrary or capricious manner. Review under this standard does not permit a court to substitute its judgment for an agency\u2019s. The district court properly ruled that SEPA had stated a rational basis for its decision to retain the present allocations of pre-ex-isting customers and to impose the 150 mile radius limitation. The former was supported by SEPA\u2019s concern about the \u201cradical impact upon existing customers and SEPA\u2019s marketing program\u201d that Electric-ities\u2019 alternative allocation proposal would have, and the latter by SEPA\u2019s explanation about its concerns regarding its limited resources.</p>\n<p id=\"b1390-4\">For these reasons, we affirm.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1390-5\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1384-9\">. Section 5 states in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1384-10\">Electric power and energy generated at reservoir projects under the control of the Department of the Army and in the opinion of the Secretary of the Army not required in the operation of such projects shall be delivered to the Secretary of Energy, who shall transmit and dispose of such power and energy in such manner as to encourage the most widespread use thereof at the lowest possible rates to consumers consistent with sound business principles, the rate schedules to become effective upon confirmation and approval by the Secretary of Energy.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1384-17\">16 U.S.C. \u00a7 825s.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1386-7\">. Plaintiffs correctly argue that <em>Chaney, </em>unlike this case, involves a nonenforcement decision. Much of the opinion in <em>Chaney </em>focuses on the issue of whether such decisions raise a presumption of judicial review, and none of that discussion is relevant to this case. <em>Chaney </em>does, however, reaffirm the approach to \u00a7 701(a)(2) first described by the Supreme Court in <em>Overton Park </em>and is therefore relevant to this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1386-8\">. The few nuggets to be mined from the legislative history consist mostly of statements by then Secretary of the Interior Harold Ickes. At the Senate Subcommittee\u2019s hearings on the Flood Control Act of 1944 Secretary Ickes stated, for example:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1386-12\">The effect of this amendment is to reaffirm the existing policy of the Congress that this property of the United States shall be disposed of in such manner as to earn a revenue, avoid monopolistic exploitation, and diffuse the benefits to numerous small purchasers.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1386-13\"><em>Flood Control; Hearings before a Subcommittee of the Committee on Commerce, United States Senate, on H.R. 4485, </em>78th Cong., 2d Sess. 461 (statement of Harold Ickes, Secretary of the Interior); <em>See also, id. </em>at 311-12 (letter of Secretary Ickes); Memorandum of Secretary Harold L.

It is clear, however, that Secretary Ickes' statements ascribe no additional meaning to \"most widespread use\u201d besides a possible anti-monopoly purpose.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1387-9\">. During the Senate debates, Senator Ellender commented:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1387-10\">The proposed amendment [which was subsequently rejected] is in conflict with the government's general power policy as embodied in the acts heretofore referred to and in the Rural Electrification Act. That policy is designed to assure the widest possible distribution of electricity at the lowest possible rates in order to build up the economic life of the regions in which power can be made available. The purpose includes the development of industry, the electrification of farms, the improvement of home life, and the general raising of living standards.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1387-15\">90 Cong.Rec. 8,360 (1944). The goals of rural electrification having been, by and large, realized, it is hard to discern any meaning that this statement adds to the phrase \"most widespread use.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1387-16\">. Plaintiffs argue that review is also available under <em>Littell v. Morton, </em>445 F.2d 1207 (4 Cir.1971). We read <em>Littell </em>as permitting where section 701(a)(2) governs, only the sort of review described by Justice Brennan in <em>Chaney, supra, </em>and by us in <em>Garcia v. Neagle, supra. </em>To the extent that <em>Littell </em>suggests a more expansive scope of review, it has been modified by later authority, particularly <em>Garcia.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1387-17\">We are also unpersuaded by plaintiffs' argument that the Department of Energy Organization Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7191 <em>et seq. </em>supplies a standard by which to review SEPA\u2019s marketing policy. That Act requires compliance with the APA\u2019s rulemaking provisions, but it does not provide a substantive standard by which to measure SEPA\u2019s marketing decisions between pref<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1268\">*1268</page-number>erence customers. Those decisions remain committed to agency discretion by law.</p>\n<p id=\"b1388-8\">For the same reason, we do not think that SEPA\u2019s failure to explain its reasons for rejecting plaintiffs\u2019 proposal that all new power be sold to new customers until all customers receive a pro rata share of SEPA power invalidates the marketing policy. Even were we to decide that SEPA had failed to explain adequately the reasons for that portion of its decision and had not abided by the guidelines of <em>State of South Carolina v. Block, </em>717 F.2d 874 (4 Cir.1983), ce<em>rt. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 104 S.Ct. 1444, 79 L.Ed.2d 764 (1984), and <em>Automotive Parts &amp; Accessories Ass'n. v. Boyd, </em>407 F.2d 330 (D.C.Cir.1968), we would not hold that the policy was invalid. In <em>Automotive Parts, </em>the court explained that the reason the APA requires a \"concise general statement of [an agency decision\u2019s] basis and purpose\" is to facilitate judicial review of the decision. 407 F.2d at 338. Where, as here, the decision is committed to agency discretion by law and therefore nonreviewable, it would be a hollow gesture resulting only in delay to remand to the agency for further explanation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b1390-7\"><em>. </em>The standard requires a reviewing court to set aside agency action, findings, or conclusions that are \"arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706(2)(a).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b1390-28\">. Plaintiffs have moved to lodge various supplemental materials with us. We grant plaintiffs' motions, and we have considered these materials, but they do not alter our decision in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
