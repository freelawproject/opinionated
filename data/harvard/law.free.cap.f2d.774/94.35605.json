HALL, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b214-22\">This case is now before us a second time following the response of the Maryland Court of Appeals, 302 Md. 383, 488 A.2d 486, to the certified question we posed to it in our first opinion, <em>Interstate Fire &amp; Casualty Co. v. Pacific Indemnity Co., </em>738 F.2d 638 (4th Cir.1984). The facts of this dispute between Pacific Indemnity Co. (\u201cPacific\u201d), the primary carrier of medical malpractice insurance, and Interstate Fire &amp; Casualty Co. (\u201cInterstate\u201d), the excess carrier, are adequately stated in our first opinion. The case first reached us when Pacific appealed the district court\u2019s order granting summary judgment to Interstate. Judge Harvey, sitting in diversity and applying Maryland law, held that Pacific\u2019s medical malpractice policy contained a separate $200,000 limit for the financial loss sustained by George M. Cross, Sr., as a result of the insured physician\u2019s alleged malpractice in the delivery of Cross\u2019s infant son, George, Jr., 568 F.Supp. 633.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-23\">According to Judge Harvey, the issue to be decided was the correct interpretation under Maryland law of Pacific\u2019s policy and, more particularly, the construction to be given the term \u201cinjury,\u201d as used in that policy. After concluding that the term was not ambiguous, the court declined to admit extrinsic evidence offered by Pacific to narrow the broad meaning of the term urged by Interstate.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b215-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>When considering Pacific\u2019s appeal, we initially determined that the district court had correctly formulated the issue. We further determined that the dispute presented an appropriate opportunity to certify a question of Maryland law to the Maryland Court of Appeals pursuant to that state\u2019s certification statute.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Accordingly the following question was certified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ABt\">Construing Pacific\u2019s policy under Maryland law, is Pacific liable to pay a separate $200,000 policy limit to Interstate for the claim of George M. Cross, Sr. for the financial injury sustained by him as a result of the insured\u2019s alleged malpractice?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b215-4\">In an opinion issued on February 25, 1985, <em>Pacific Indemnity v. Interstate Fire &amp; Casualty, </em>302 Md. 383, 488 A.2d 486 (1985), the Maryland Court of Appeals held that, because it found the term \u201cinjury\u201d as used in Pacific\u2019s policy ambiguous, it could not determine the extent of Pacific\u2019s liability.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Despite its expressed inability to answer the specific question posed to it, we conclude that the response of the Maryland Court of Appeals, if not explicitly, then through clear implication, provides the guidance this Court sought through the certification process. This appeal, therefore, is now ripe for further disposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-5\">Given the opinion of the Maryland Court of Appeals, it is now clear that under Maryland law, Pacific insurance policy is facially ambiguous. The proper resolution of this dispute requires the trial court to admit available extrinsic evidence \u201cto show the parties\u2019 intent and to show whether the term does or does not have a particular trade usage.\u201d <em>St. Paul Fire &amp; Marine Insurance Co. v. Pryseski, </em>292 Md. 187, 198, 438 A.2d 282, 288 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b215-10\">We, therefore, vacate the decision below granting summary judgment to Interstate and remand this case to the district court. We instruct the court to utilize the guidance provided by the Maryland Court of Appeals and to give consideration to such relevant extrinsic evidence that either Pacific or Interstate may offer in order to clarify the language of the policy in dispute.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-11\">VACATED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b214-16\">. At trial below, Pacific had sought to introduce extrinsic evidence to demonstrate that the word \"injury\u201d in medical malpractice policies had consistently been interpreted within the insurance industry of the state of Maryland as being synonomous with \u201cbodily injury.\u201d Judge Har<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>vey declined to admit the evidence, concluding that \u201cinjury\" was not a facially ambiguous term. Furthermore, Judge Harvey stated that no cited case law supported a conclusion that a term \"clearly broader than the more limited words \u201cbodily injury' or \u2018personal injury\u2019\" should be interpreted in the restrictive manner suggested by Pacific.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b215-7\">. Md.Cts. &amp; Jud.Proc.Code Ann. \u00a7\u00a7 12-601 <em>et seq. </em>(1984 Replacement Vol.).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b215-20\">. The Maryland Court of Appeals conducted a new and exhaustive examination of the term \"injury\" as used in the policy. The court concluded that the document was drafted in a circular fashion with no adequate internal definition of its key terms. The court further stated that \u201cusing the standard of a reasonable layperson each party advances a reasonable interpretation\" of the term \"injury,\u201d and that the conflicting definitions offered by both Pacific and Interstate could each be made to conform to the overall policy language.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
