The Merit Systems Protection Board (\u201cMSPB\u201d) affirmed his dismissal in a decision issued on November 16,1981. On December 16, 1981, Lee timely filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Georgia seeking judicial review of the MSPB decision. The complaint was dismissed on August 5, 1982, without prejudice. On May 26, 1983, Lee filed a second complaint in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Georgia, seeking review of the decision of the MSPB pursuant to 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7703(b)(1), (2). Under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7703(b)(1), (2), the plaintiff must file suit within thirty days of the final agency decision. On December 7,1984, the district court requested briefs from the parties regarding the timeliness of the filing of the plaintiffs complaint. After considering the parties\u2019 briefs, on March 1, 1985, the district court ordered that Lee\u2019s action be dismissed since it had been untimely filed. On appeal, the plaintiff contends that the issue of timeliness was not appropriately placed before the district court and that the district court incorrectly found the complaint to be untimely.</p>\n<p id=\"b1188-11\">We need not consider whether the district court could <em>sua sponte </em>address the issue of timeliness; Lee is clearly wrong in contending that the Postal Service did not raise the issue of timeliness. <em>See </em>Record at 7, 8 (Answer of Postal Service), and at 56, 57 (Pretrial Order describing Rule 16 pretrial conference).</p>\n<p id=\"b1188-12\">Assuming, without deciding, that timely filing is not a prerequisite to federal jurisdiction <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and that equitable tolling principles may be applied to the filing of a complaint for judicial review of an MSPB decision,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> we find that in the district court Lee <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1069\">*1069</page-number>did not proffer any facts which might be grounds for equitable tolling.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Therefore, we conclude that Lee\u2019s complaint was untimely, and that the district court committed no error in ordering that Lee\u2019s action be dismissed on that ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b1189-5\">The judgment of the district court is</p>\n<p id=\"AFbI\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1188-8\">. The district court appears to have considered timeliness to be a jurisdictional prerequisite since it dismissed the action pursuant to Rule 12(b)(1) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and since it found that untimeliness \u201cdefeat[ed] the jurisdiction of this court.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1188-9\">. Lee\u2019s case involved charges of discrimination and, as required by 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7703(b)(2), Lee filed his complaint with the district court under the provisions of \u00a7 717(c) of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-16(c). There are no circuit court decisions directly deciding whether the time limit in \u00a7 7703(b)(2) is subject to equitable tolling, and we need not reach that issue in the instant case. However, we note that the law in this circuit is clear that the time limit of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-16(c), under which Lee was required to file his district court complaint (because 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-16(c) is incorporated by \u00a7 7703(b)(2)), is subject to equitable tolling. In <em>Milam v. United States Postal Service, </em>674 F.2d 860, 861 (11th Cir.1982), this court held that timely filing under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-16(c) was not a prerequisite to federal jurisdiction. <em>See Miller v. Marsh, </em>766 F.2d 490, 493 (11th Cir.1985) (\u201cTitle VII's statutory 30-day limitations period [42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-16(c)] is not jurisdictional and is subject to equitable tolling\u201d). <em>See generally Zipes v. Trans World Airlines, Inc., </em>455 U.S. 385, 102 S.Ct. 1127, 71 L.Ed.2d 234 (1982); <em>Coke v. General Adjustment Bureau, Inc., </em>640 F.2d 584, 594 (5th Cir.1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b1188-14\">In the only case our research has discovered which addresses this issue, the district court in the District of Columbia Circuit decided that timely filing under \u00a7 7703(b)(2) was a prerequisite to federal jurisdiction. <em>King v. Dole, </em>595 F.Supp. 1140, 1144 (D.D.C.1984). The court in that case found that, contrary to the law in this circuit, timely filing under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-16 is jurisdictional in the D.C. Circuit. <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Hofer v. Campbell, </em>581 F.2d 975, 977 (D.C.Cir.1978), <em>cert. denied, </em>440 U.S. 909, 99 S.Ct. 1218, 59 L.Ed.2d 457; <em>Richardson v. Wiley, </em>569 F.2d 140, 142 (D.C.Cir.1977)). In addition, that court stated that since the language of \u00a7 7703(b)(2) parallels the language of \u00a7 7703(b)(1), which governs appeals of MSPB decisions not involving allegations of discrimination, and since the 30-day time period set out in \u00a7 7703(b)(1) has been determined to be jurisdictional, <em>Monzo v. Dept. of Transportation, </em>735 F.2d 1335, 1336 (Fed.Cir.1984); <em>Devine v. White, </em>697 F.2d 421, 429 (D.C.Cir.1983); <em>Lewis v. IRS, </em>691 F.2d 858, 859 (8th Cir.1982); <em>Miller v. United States Postal Service, </em>685 F.2d 148, 149 (5th Cir.1982), <em>cert. denied, </em>461 U.S. 916, 103 S.Ct. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1069\">*1069</page-number>1898, 77 L.Ed.2d 286 (1983); <em>Boehm v. Foster, </em>670 F.2d 111, 113 (9th Cir.1982), the time limit of \u00a7 7703(b)(2), like that of \u00a7 7703(b)(1), should not be subject to enlargement by equitable tolling.</p>\n<p id=\"b1189-16\">Since we find that the circumstances do not present grounds for equitable tolling, we need not resolve this issue.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1189-17\">. Arguments not presented to the district court and first made on appeal are generally not considered by an appellate court. <em>See Dean Witter Reynolds, Inc. v. Fernandez, </em>741 F.2d 355, 360-61 (11th Cir.1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b1189-18\">While we need not and do not reach the issue, the only argument that Lee seems to have made for equitable tolling is that the counsel who represented him in his first complaint to the district court and who filed his second complaint in the district court ineffectively represented him. It appears that this would not be grounds for making equitable tolling available. <em>See Chappell v. Emco Machine Works Co., </em>601 F.2d 1295, 1303 (5th Cir.1979) (\"[i]f we were to find that [plaintiffs] reliance on [a member of a state employment commission who promised to file a complaint on plaintiff\u2019s behalf] tolled the time period, there would be no logical reason for denying tolling to a person who has relied on a lawyer or a relative or an acquaintance to file his or her complaint\u201d) (dicta in a Title VII action). <em>See also Smith v. McClammy, </em>740 F.2d 925, 927 (11th Cir.1984) (the \"basic principle ... is that equitable tolling is based upon the actions of someone other than the claimant that are misleading or constituted fraudulent conduct\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
