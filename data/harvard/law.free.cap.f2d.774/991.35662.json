The Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) began deportation proceedings against petitioner charging that he was deportable as a non-immigrant crewman under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1251(a)(2) (1982), and ineligible for suspension of deportation for the same reason under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1254(f). After a deportation hearing the IJ found Guinto deportable and also denied discretionary relief.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The IJ ordered Guinto to voluntarily leave the country within six months. In due course, the BIA affirmed the IJ\u2019s decision. On appeal, Guinto argues that the INS failed to carry its burden to prove his entry as a crewman, and hence deportability, and that the immigration statutes, insofar as they exclude crewman from discretionary relief, violate the Equal Protection Clause.</p>\n<p id=\"AOGu\">Guinto\u2019s contention that he was not a crewman ineligible for suspension of deportation under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1254(f) is merit-less. There is ample evidence to support the BIA's determination that he had entered as a crewman. For example, the evidence includes <em>a </em>crewman\u2019s book detailing the desertion of an Abelardo Guinto whose photograph is a good likeness of petitioner Guinto, indicating that petitioner falls directly into the category of a seaman overstaying his leave, and thus is deportable under section 241(a)(2) and ineligible for suspension of deportation under section 244(f) of the Immigration and Nationality Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b1112-8\">Even if the record supported his claim that he later left the country and reentered without inspection, he would be ineligible for suspension of deportation because by leaving the country and reentering, he would have broken the chain of seven years\u2019 continuous presence required for discretionary relief. <em>See INS v. Phinpathya, </em>464 U.S. 183, 104 S.Ct. 584, 589-90, 78 L.Ed.2d 40 (1984).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1112-9\">Guinto also claims that any statutory exclusion of crewmen from eligibility for discretionary relief violates the Equal Protection Clause. This argument is easily disposed of. Classifications among aliens in immigration statutes are evaluated under the mere rationality test. <em>Pavinthara v. INS, </em>708 F.2d 472, 473 (9th Cir.), <em>modified, </em>721 F.2d 651 (9th Cir.1983); <em>United States v. Barajas-Guillen, </em>632 F.2d 749, 752 (9th Cir.1980). Congress could rationally have determined that seamen pose a special immigration problem because they reach our shores without going through the normal visa process. Thus the rational basis for denying seamen discretionary relief is to deter them from \u201cjumping ship.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1112-10\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1112-6\">. The IJ denied Guinto\u2019s request for suspension of deportation on the alternate grounds that he was statutorily ineligible under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1254(f), and that he had not sufficiently shown that his deportation would result in undue hardship.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1112-7\">. Because Guinto is ineligible for suspension of deportation, it is unnecessary for us to reach petitioner\u2019s claim that the BIA abused its discretion in finding that deportation would not result in undue hardship. Thus we reserve the following question: May the BIA use the fact of an alien's marriage to a citizen as a factor weighing <em>against </em>hardship because such a marriage enables the alien to \"readily obtain an immigrant visa\u201d after deportation? <em>See Mejia-Carillo v. United States, </em>656 F.2d 520, 522 (9th Cir.1981) (\u201cthe Board must consider personal and emotional hardships which result from deporta-tion____ The most important single factor may be the separation of the alien from family living in the United States.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
