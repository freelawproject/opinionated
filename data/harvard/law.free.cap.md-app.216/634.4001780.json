FOP\u2019s claim for attorneys\u2019 fees and costs was filed after appellant scored a court victory over Montgomery County (\u201cappellee\u201d or \u201cthe County\u201d); the Court of Appeals ruled that a grievance filed by FOP was subject to arbitration pursuant to a collective bargaining agreement between the parties. <em>Montgomery County, Maryland v. Fraternal Order of Police, Montgomery </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"636\">*636</page-number><em>County Lodge 35, Inc., </em>427 Md. 561, 567, 50 A.3d 579 (2012) (hereafter referred to as <em>\u201cFOP </em>/\u201d). After the Court of Appeals ruled in <em>FOP I </em>that the grievance was indeed subject to arbitration, FOP filed its petition asking that the Circuit Court for Montgomery County order the County to reimburse FOP for the litigation expenses and costs it had incurred up to that point in its efforts to establish and confirm that the grievance was arbitrable. The circuit court rejected FOP\u2019s argument that \u00a7 3-228(b) of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article of the Maryland Code authorizes such an award of litigation expenses at that preliminary stage in the arbitration proceedings, and the court denied FOP\u2019s fee petition. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-4\">QUESTION PRESENTED</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b658-5\">Appellant presents a single question for our review: Does Section 3-228(b) of the Maryland Uniform Arbitration Act permit a court, following litigation of a petition to stay arbitration, to award the prevailing party reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees and costs?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b658-6\">We will affirm the circuit court\u2019s denial of the appellant\u2019s Petition for Award of Costs and Disbursements.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-7\">FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b658-8\">The proceedings that led to the present dispute were described as follows by the Court of Appeals in <em>FOP I:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b658-9\">The Fraternal Order of Police, Montgomery County Lodge 35, Inc. (\u201cFOP\u201d or \u201cAppellee\u201d) filed a grievance under the \u201cMaintenance of Standards\u201d provision of its collective bargaining agreement (\u201cCBA\u201d or \u201cAgreement\u201d) with Montgomery County (\u201cCounty\u201d or \u201cAppellant\u201d) following the County\u2019s unilateral decision to discontinue a long-standing practice of allowing shop stewards to sit in on disciplinary interrogations for training purposes. The County filed a motion to dismiss the grievance, arguing that arbitration of the issue was preempted by the Law Enforcement Officers\u2019 Bill of Rights ... [LEOBR]. The arbitrator deter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"637\">*637</page-number>mined that the grievance was not preempted and denied the motion to dismiss. The County then filed a petition to vacate the \u201carbitration award\u201d in the Circuit Court for Montgomery County. The Circuit Court affirmed the arbitrator\u2019s decision and granted summary judgment on behalf of the FOP. We affirm the judgment of the Circuit Court that the LEOBR is not implicated by the steward training grievance and, therefore, does not preempt its arbitration under the CBA.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b659-4\">427 Md. at 564, 50 A.3d 579 (emphasis added) (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b659-5\">The Court of Appeals observed in <em>FOP I </em>that the County had been mistaken in labeling its motion as a petition to vacate an arbitration award; there <em>was no award to be vacated. </em>Consequently, the Court of Appeals treated the claim for relief which the County had labeled a \u201cpetition to vacate\u201d as a motion to stay arbitration. The Court explained, <em>id. </em>at 568-69, 50 A.3d 579:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b659-6\">Preliminarily, we take this opportunity to clarify the procedural issue raised by the trial judge when, in confirming the determination of the arbitrator, he noted confusion as to whether a petition to \u201cvacate\u201d was the \u201ccorrect terminology,\u201d under the circumstances. Indeed, by filing a petition to vacate the \u201carbitration award,\u201d the County suggested that an award was, in fact, made by the arbitrator. It used language throughout the petition that referred to the arbitrator\u2019s denial of its dispositive motion as an \u201caward,\u201d despite its preliminary nature and the fact that arbitration on the merits had not taken place.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b659-7\">Appellant apparently relied on <em>Montgomery County v. Fraternal Order of Police Montgomery County Lodge 35, Inc., </em>147 Md.App. 659, 810 A.2d 519 (2002) <em>(\u201cLodge 35 </em>\u201d), as the blueprint for pursuing this procedural error. In that case the FOP requested arbitration, and the County, rather than petitioning the circuit court for a stay of arbitration, filed a motion to dismiss before the arbitrator, arguing that the particular dispute was not arbitrable. After the arbitrator denied the motion to dismiss, the County filed a \u201cpeti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"638\">*638</page-number>tion to vacate arbitration award\u201d in the circuit court. The circuit court affirmed the determination of arbitrability, which was then appealed. On appeal, the intermediate appellate court stated that although the arbitrator issued a preliminary decision rather than a final award, \u201c[n]evertheless, the parties have not argued that an arbitrator has to render a final award before a petition to vacate a preliminary decision can be filed, and we are not aware of any authority compelling that conclusion.\u201d <em>Lodge 35, </em>147 Md. App. at 666, 810 A.2d at 523. The intermediate appellate court then continued to evaluate whether the arbitrator exceeded his powers and whether the \u201caward\u201d should be \u201cvacated\u201d under the Arbitration Act, Maryland Code \u00a7 3-224 of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b660-4\">The reasoning of the intermediate appellate court in <em>Lodge 35 </em>is incorrect because it is clear, pursuant to our case law, that a petition to vacate an arbitration award requires an actual award, <em>i.e., </em>a final decision by an arbitrator on the merits. <em>See Messersmith, Inc. v. Barclay Townhouse, </em>313 Md. 652, 663, 547 A.2d 1048, 1053 (1988) (noting that Md.Code \u00a7 3-208 and \u00a7 3-224 of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article are \u201cmechanisms through which a court (based upon its independent assessment of the evidence thereby concluding that no agreement to arbitrate exists) is authorized to either stay an arbitration proceeding, under \u00a7 3-208, or invalidate it <em>after the fact, </em>under \u00a7 3-224(b)(5).\u201d (emphasis added)); <em>Brewster v. Woodhaven Bldg. &amp; Dev., Inc., </em>360 Md. 602, 620, 759 A.2d 738, 753-54 (2000) (noting that \u00a7 3-224 is one of three sections of the Arbitration Act which \u201cpermit parties who have <em>been through arbitration </em>to file certain <em>post-award </em>petitions in the Circuit Court ...\u201d (Wilner, J., dissenting on other grounds)); <em>Stauffer Constr. Co. v. Bd. of Educ., </em>54 Md.App. 658, 664, 460 A.2d 609, 612 (1983) (\u201cWhen such an [arbitration] agreement exists, or is alleged to exist, the courts are generally enjoined by the statute from interfering with the arbitration process. Indeed, the court\u2019s jurisdiction [before arbitration is completed] may properly be invoked in but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"639\">*639</page-number>two limited contexts\u2014to compel arbitration or to stay it.\u201d); Martin Domke, Domke On Commercial Arbitration, \u00a7 39:6 at 15-16 (3d ed. 2012) (\u201cBefore an [arbitration] award is ripe for review, it must be \u2018definite and final,\u2019 \u201d and resolve the parties\u2019 dispute, (footnote omitted)).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b661-4\">Despite [the fact that the County filed] an incorrect motion, however, we treat the County\u2019s \u201cpetition to vacate arbitration award,\u201d in the present case, as a motion to stay arbitration.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b661-5\">The Court of Appeals ruled in <em>FOP I </em>that the circuit court\u2019s denial of the County\u2019s motion to stay the arbitration was immediately appealable because such an order \u201c \u2018exhausts the court\u2019s jurisdiction.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 570, 50 A.3d 579 (quoting <em>Brewster, supra, </em>360 Md. at 631, 759 A.2d 738). Similarly, the order as to which FOP noted the present appeal exhausted the circuit court\u2019s jurisdiction once again, and was immediately appealable.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-6\">The instant appeal flows from FOP\u2019s decision to file in the circuit court\u2014before proceeding with the arbitration of its grievance\u2014a Petition for Award of Costs and Disbursements. FOP asserts (and the County does not dispute) that the Maryland Uniform Arbitration Act (\u201cMUAA\u201d), codified at Md.Code (1973, 2013 Repl. Vol.), Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article (\u201cCJP\u201d), \u00a7 3-201 <em>et see/., </em>governs these proceedings. FOP argued in its fee petition that CJP \u00a7 3-228(b) authorizes the circuit court to order the County to reimburse FOP for all of the litigation expenses FOP had incurred up to that point, including attorneys\u2019 fees, in the amount of $52,971.84. FOP contends that CJP \u00a7 3-228(b) permits a court to enter an order for such fee shifting with respect to \u201cany petition\u201d that is filed relative to a proceeding under the MUAA.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-7\">The County filed an opposition to FOP\u2019s fee petition, and, following a hearing on April 9, 2013, the circuit court denied FOP\u2019s request. FOP then noted the present appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"640\">*640</page-number>STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b662-4\">Because this case turns upon an issue of statutory construction, our review is <em>de novo. Addison v. Lochearn Nursing Home, LLC, 411 </em>Md. 251, 275-77, 983 A.2d 138 (2009). The Court of Appeals summarized the relevant principles of statutory construction in <em>Victoria Falls v. Prince George\u2019s County, </em>438 Md. 391, 401-03, 92 A.3d 365, 2014 WL 1128391 (2014):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b662-5\">\u201cThe cardinal rule of statutory interpretation is to ascertain and effectuate the real and actual intent of the Legislature. A court\u2019s primary goal in interpreting statutory language is to discern the legislative purpose, the ends to be accomplished, or the evils to be remedied by the statutory provision under scrutiny.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b662-6\">\u201cTo ascertain the intent of the General Assembly, we begin with the normal, plain meaning of the language of the statute. If the language of the statute is unambiguous and clearly consistent -with the statute\u2019s apparent purpose, our inquiry as to legislative intent ends ordinarily and we apply the statute as written, without resort to other rules of construction. We neither add nor delete language so as to reflect an intent not evidenced in the plain and unambiguous language of the statute, and we do not construe a statute with \u2018forced or subtle interpretations\u2019 that limit or extend its application.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b662-7\">\u201cWe, however, do not read statutory language in a vacuum, nor do we confine strictly our interpretation of a statute\u2019s plain language to the isolated section alone. Rather, the plain language must be viewed within the context of the statutory scheme to which it belongs, considering the purpose, aim, or policy of the Legislature in enacting the statute. We presume that the Legislature intends its enactments to operate together as a consistent and harmonious body of law, and, thus, we seek to reconcile and harmonize the parts of a statute, to the extent possible consistent with the statute\u2019s object and scope.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b663-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"641\">*641</page-number>\u201cWhere the words of a statute are ambiguous and subject to more than one reasonable interpretation, or where the words are clear and unambiguous when viewed in isolation, but become ambiguous when read as a part of a larger statutory scheme, a court must resolve the ambiguity by searching for legislative intent in other indicia, including the history of the legislation or other relevant sources intrinsic and extrinsic to the legislative process. In resolving ambiguities, a court considers the structure of the statute, how it relates to other laws, its general purpose, and the relative rationality and legal effect of various competing constructions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b663-4\">\u201cIn every case, the statute must be given a reasonable interpretation, not one that is absurd, illogical, or incompatible with common sense.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b663-5\">(Quoting <em>Mummert v.

The MUAA was adopted by the General Assembly in 1973, and the act \u201c \u2018expresses the legislative policy favoring enforcement of agreements to arbitrate,\u2019 <em>Allstate Ins. Co. v. Stinebaugh, </em>374 Md. 631, 641, 824 A.2d 87, 93 (2003), by giving the courts jurisdiction to enforce arbitration agreements and enter judgments on arbitration awards.\u201d <em>Questar Homes of Avalon, LLC v. Pillar Constr., Inc., </em>388 Md. 675, 684, 882 A.2d 288 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b663-8\">FOP\u2019s petition seeking costs was based expressly upon CJP \u00a7 3-228, which is captioned \u201cJudgment, costs, and disbursements,\u201d and provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b663-9\">(a) <em>Entering of judgment; enforcement of </em>judgment.\u2014(1) If an order confirming, modifying, or correcting an award is granted, a judgment shall be entered in conformity with the order.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b664-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"642\">*642</page-number>(2) The judgment may be enforced as any other judgment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b664-4\">(b) <em>Costs and </em>disbursements.\u2014A court may award costs of the petition, the subsequent proceedings, and disbursements.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b664-5\">In its brief, FOP asserts that \u201c[t]he meaning of Section 3-228(b) ultimately depends on the meaning of the term \u2018petition,\u2019 as used in that provision.\u201d FOP further contends \u201cthat subsection (b)\u2019s reference to \u2018petition\u2019 includes both petitions to vacate arbitration awards under the MUAA ... and petitions to stay arbitration under the MUAA (as in this case), ... provided that the party filing such a petition is unsuccessful in the court proceedings.\u201d The linchpin of FOP\u2019s argument is its insistence that \u201cSection 3-228(b) of the MUAA plainly permits an award of fees and costs to the prevailing party after litigation on any petition filed under the MUAA.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b664-6\">It is immediately apparent that FOP\u2019s argument is largely dependent upon its substitution of the words \u201cany petition\u201d for the phrase that actually appears in CJP \u00a7 3-228(b), which is \u201cthe petition.\u201d The legislature did not use the phrase <em>\u201cany </em>petition,\u201d and we agree with the circuit court\u2019s conclusion that it would be improper to interpret CJP \u00a7 3-228 as if that phraseology had been chosen by the General Assembly.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-7\">In the County\u2019s brief, the appellee responded to the appellant\u2019s argument that CJP \u00a7 3-228(b) permits a court to award fees and costs relative to \u201cany petition filed under the MUAA\u201d by observing, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b664-8\">The trial court correctly rejected this interpretation, which reads subsection (b) in isolation from the rest of \u00a7 3-228. The more reasonable reading of the law is one that reads \u00a7 3-228 as a whole. \u201cThe petition\u201d in subsection (b) is a reference to the immediately preceding language in subsection (a). Thus, \u201cthe petition\u201d in subsection (b) is any petition that results in \u201can order confirming, modifying, or correcting an award,\u201d as described in subsection (a).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b665-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"643\">*643</page-number>As noted above, the Court of Appeals observed in <em>FOP I </em>that, although the County erroneously captioned its motion as a \u201cPetition to Vacate Arbitration Award,\u201d no arbitration on the merits had taken place. The Court of Appeals stated: \u201c[I]t is clear, pursuant to our case law, that a petition to vacate an arbitration award requires an actual award, <em>i.e., </em>a final decision by the arbitrator on the merits.\u201d 427 Md. at 569, 50 A.3d 579. The Court concluded that, despite the label the County placed on its motion, \u201cwe treat the County\u2019s \u2018petition to vacate arbitration award,\u2019 in the present case, as a motion to stay arbitration.\u201d <em>Id. </em>But we cannot rest our decision upon the ruling in <em>FOP I </em>that the County had effectively filed a \u201cmotion to stay\u201d rather than a \u201cpetition to vacate.\u201d FOP correctly points out that the provision of the MUAA which permits a party to file a motion to stay arbitration\u2014CJP \u00a7 3-208\u2014 describes such a request as a \u201cpetition ... to stay commenced or threatened arbitration proceedings.\u201d Consequently, even though the Court of Appeals expressly \u201ctreat[ed] the County\u2019s petition ... as a motion to stay arbitration,\u201d <em>FOP I, supra, </em>427 Md. at 569, 50 A.3d 579 (quotation marks omitted), the MUAA recognizes that such a motion can also be called a petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-4\">Nevertheless, we conclude that the reference in CJP \u00a7 3-228(b) to an award of costs relative to \u201cthe petition\u201d refers to a petition filed in court pursuant to either CJP \u00a7 3-223, \u00a7 3-224, or \u00a7 3-227, subsequent to the delivery of an arbitration award, seeking court action upon the award. We reach this conclusion by applying the principle of statutory construction that requires us to \u201cinterpret a provision \u2018in the context of the entire statutory scheme of which it is a part.\u2019 \u201d <em>Park &amp; Planning v. Anderson, </em>164 Md.App. 540, 570, 884 A.2d 157 (2005) (quoting <em>Gordon Family P\u2019ship v. Gar on Jer, </em>348 Md. 129, 138, 702 A.2d 753 (1997)), <em>aff'd, </em>395 Md. 172, 182, 909 A.2d 694 (2006). Our conclusion is bolstered by a review of the statutory history of CJP \u00a7 3-228(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b665-5\">With respect to the statutory scheme in which CJP \u00a7 3-228(b) must be read, we note that the MUAA contains no statutory definition of the term \u201cpetition.\u201d Consequently, we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"644\">*644</page-number>look to the context in which that word is used in CJP \u00a7 3-228(b). The sequence of the provisions in CJP Subtitle 2 leading up to \u00a7 3-228 includes the following. Sections 3-201 through 3-218 all deal with issues that could arise prior to delivery of the arbitration award to the parties. Section 3-219 provides that the \u201carbitration award shall be in writing,\u201d and provides for delivery of copies of the award to the parties. Section 3-220 addresses transcription of the proceedings. Section 3-221 notes that the award \u201cshall provide for payment of the arbitrators\u2019 expenses, fees, and any other expense incurred in the conduct of the arbitration,\u201d but also specifies that, \u201c[ujnless the arbitration agreement provides otherwise, the award may not include counsel fees.\u201d Section 3-222 provides that a party \u201cmay apply to the arbitrators to modify or correct an award within 20 days after delivery of the award to the applicant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b666-4\">Beginning with CJP \u00a7 3-223, most of the remaining sections in the MUAA address the procedures to be followed if the parties need to seek relief in court after the arbitration award has been issued by the arbitrators. These provisions make several references to post-award petitions that may be filed in court. Section 3-223 provides: \u201cA petition to modify or correct the award shall be filed within 90 days after delivery of a copy of the award to the applicant.\u201d Section 3-224 provides for filing \u201ca petition to vacate the award.\u201d Section 3-225 provides for rehearing in the event a petition to vacate is granted. Section 3-226 is captioned \u201cDenial of petition to vacate,\u201d and provides for the court to \u201cconfirm the award.\u201d Section 3-227(a) states: \u201cA party may petition the court to confirm the award.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b666-5\">The next section in the MUAA is the section at issue in the present appeal, CJP \u00a7 3-228, which, as quoted above, provides in subsection (a) for the entry of a judgment \u201c[i]f an order confirming, modifying, or correcting an award is granted,\u201d and then states in subsection (b) that \u201c[a] court may award costs of the petition, the subsequent proceedings, and disbursements.\u201d In our view, when \u00a7 3-228(b) is read in context in the MUAA, it clearly refers to awarding costs if the court grants a petition <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"645\">*645</page-number>to confirm, or modify, or correct an arbitration award. No such petition was ever filed in the present proceedings. Consequently, CJP \u00a7 3\u2014228(b) does not provide any authority for a court to entertain or grant FOP\u2019s Petition for Award of Costs and Disbursements relative to the expenses FOP incurred in responding to the County\u2019s effort to avoid arbitration of the grievance.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b668-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"646\">*646</page-number>Both parties cited <em>Blitz v. Beth Isaac Adas Israel Congregation, </em>352 Md. 31, 720 A.2d 912 (1998), in support of their respective positions. In <em>Blitz, </em>after a rabbi and a synagogue submitted a dispute to an arbitration panel, the arbitrators ordered the synagogue to pay Blitz $5,000. The synagogue did not pay. Rabbi Blitz then filed, in the Circuit Court for Baltimore County, a Petition to Confirm and Enforce Arbitration Award and Complaint for Damages, asking the court to not only order the synagogue to pay the $5,000 arbitration award, but also that it be required to pay Blitz\u2019s costs and fees, including attorneys\u2019 fees, incurred in filing and pursuing the petition to enforce the award. The court ordered the synagogue to pay Blitz\u2019s costs and disbursements, but not his attorneys\u2019 fees. When Blitz appealed to this Court, we affirmed, but the Court of Appeals then reversed our ruling and held that reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees were recoverable. The question presented, as the Court framed it, was whether \u201cthe prevailing party in a binding arbitration proceeding may recover reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees when the losing party\u2019s unjustified refusal to comply with the award requires the prevailing party to institute and successfully prosecute an action in order to confirm and enforce the arbitration award.\u201d <em>Id. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"647\">*647</page-number>at 33, 720 A.2d 912.

A later opinion was issued in <em>Blitz, </em>clarifying that the Court\u2019s \u201cdecision contemplated the payment of <em>all </em>attorneys\u2019 fees necessary to obtain confirmation of the arbitration award.... \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 47, 720 A.2d 912. The Court then spelled out its holding: \u201c[P]ursuant to 3-228(b), the prevailing party is entitled to recover attorneys\u2019 fees incurred both at trial and on appeal in confirming and enforcing an arbitration award.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b669-5\">One of the out-of-state cases the <em>Blitz </em>Court cited with approval was a Nevada case interpreting a comparable section of the Uniform Arbitration Act. In <em>County of Clark v. Blanchard Construction Co., </em>98 Nev. 488, 653 P.2d 1217, 1220 (1982), the Nevada court held that the provision in its arbitration statute that was comparable to CJP \u00a7 3-228(b) applied only to expenses incurred after issuance of the arbitration award. The <em>Blitz </em>Court stated, 352 Md. at 42, 720 A.2d 912:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b669-6\">The court in <em>County of Clark v. Blanchard Constr. Co. </em>[653 P.2d at 1220] recognized the significant difference between the initial arbitration proceedings and the confirmation proceedings when it interpreted its version of \u00a7 3-228 \u201cto mean that the court is permitted to award attorneys\u2019 fees only for the effort expended in this case in obtaining an order confirming the arbitration award and not for any efforts expended prior to that time.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b669-7\">The holding in <em>Blitz </em>is entirely consistent with our interpretation of CJP \u00a7 3-228(b), and does not provide any support for FOP\u2019s argument that that provision of the MUAA also applies to petitions to stay arbitration.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-8\">We also note that the statutory history of CJP \u00a7 3-228(b) supports our conclusion that the petition referred to in that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"648\">*648</page-number>subsection must be a petition filed subsequent to the delivery of the arbitration award. The County traces the statutory predecessors of CJP \u00a7 3-228 back to 1965, when Maryland first adopted an arbitration statute based upon the Uniform Arbitration Act, <em>viz., </em>1965 Laws of Maryland Chapter 231, which was codified as Maryland Code (1957, 1965 supp.), Article 7. In that version of the Maryland Uniform Arbitration Act, Art. 7, \u00a7 14\u2014which is the provision most comparable to CJP \u00a7 3-228\u2014provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b670-5\">Upon the granting of an order confirming, modifying or correcting an award, judgment or decree shall be entered in conformity therewith and be enforced as any other judgment or decree. Costs of the application and of the proceedings subsequent thereto, and disbursements may be awarded by the court.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b670-6\">The two sentences in Art. 7, \u00a7 14 of the original act were a single paragraph until a major code revision produced the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article in 1973, at which time the two sentences were recodified as CJP \u00a7 3-228. The revisor\u2019s note to CJP \u00a7 3-228 indicated that the change was merely \u201cin style.\u201d <em>See Allen v. State, </em>402 Md. 59, 71, 935 A.2d 421 (2007) (a change in phraseology of statute as part of substantial recodification is generally not indicative of intent to modify the law or change the meaning of a statute). Although the phraseology of the concepts expressed in Art. 7, \u00a7 14 of the original MUAA has evolved slightly as a result of code revisions since 1965, none of the revisions reflect a legislative intent to broaden the scope of the language that is presently codified in CJP \u00a7 3-228(b) to provide for the award of fees and costs related to petitions filed prior to the issuance of the arbitration award. The circuit court correctly rejected FOP\u2019s application for attorneys\u2019 fees and costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-7\">Finally, we observe that FOP would have fared no better if Maryland had adopted the most current iteration of the comparable provision in the Revised Uniform Arbitration Act as published in 2000 by the National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws. <em>See </em>Uniform Laws Annotated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"649\">*649</page-number>(2009), Volume 7, Part 1A. Section 25 of the 2000 edition of the Revised Uniform Arbitration Act is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b671-4\">\u00a7 25. Judgment on Award; Attorney\u2019s Fees and Litigation Expenses.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b671-5\">(a) Upon granting an order confirming, vacating without directing a rehearing, modifying, or correcting an award, the court shall enter a judgment in conformity therewith. The judgment may be recorded, docketed, and enforced as any other judgment in a civil action.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b671-6\">(b) A court may allow reasonable costs of the [motion] and subsequent judicial proceedings.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b671-7\">(c) On [application] of a prevailing party to a contested judicial proceeding under Section 22, 23, or 24, the court may add reasonable attorney\u2019s fees and other reasonable expenses of litigation incurred in a judicial proceeding after the award is made to a judgment confirming, vacating without directing a rehearing, modifying, or correcting an award.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b671-8\">(Emphasis added; brackets in original.) Sections 22, 23, and 24 of the Revised Uniform Arbitration Act all relate to post-award proceedings in which a party asks a court to either confirm, vacate, modify, or correct an award that has been issued. Consequently, if the Maryland General Assembly were to revise CJP \u00a7 3-228 to conform to \u00a7 25 of the Revised Uniform Arbitration Act, the result in this case would be no different.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-9\">JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR MONTGOMERY COUNTY AFFIRMED.

We are confident that that was not what the legislature envisioned when it adopted CJP \u00a7 3-228(b). <em>See Blandon v. State, </em>304 Md. 316, 319, 498 A.2d 1195 (1985) (stating that courts should \u201cavoid construing a statute in a way which would lead to absurd results\u201d).</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
