Darlene received a HCVP termination notice dated April 4, 2012, and subsequently requested an informal hearing, which was held on May 16, 2012. By letter dated May 31, 2012, the HABC Hearing Officer informed Darlene that the HABC\u2019s decision to terminate would be upheld.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-4\">On June 14, 2012, Darlene filed a Petition for Administrative Mandamus in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City, asking the circuit court to review the HABC Hearing Officer\u2019s decision. Following a hearing on December 11, 2012, the court affirmed the HABC\u2019s decision. This timely appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-5\">Questions Presented</p>\n<p id=\"b597-6\">Darlene asks:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b597-7\">1. Did the HABC Hearing Officer err as a matter of law when she concluded that allowing a non-household member to use the subsidized unit\u2019s address to receive mail was a HCVP violation?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b597-8\">2. Does the HABC termination hearing record lack substantial evidence to support a finding that [Gerald] was living in [Darlene\u2019s] unit as an unauthorized occupant?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b597-9\">In its brief, the HABC initially responds by arguing that this Court is \u201cwithout jurisdiction to hear th[is] appeal\u201d pursuant to Md.Code (1973, 2013 Repl. Vol.), \u00a7 12-302(a) of the Courts\u2019 &amp; Judicial Proceedings Article (\u201cCJP\u201d). We disagree as to the jurisdictional issue and, upon review of the merits of the case, reverse the Hearing Officer\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-10\">Facts and Procedural History</p>\n<p id=\"b597-11\">The facts of this case are undisputed.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Darlene and Gerald married in August 2002. A few months later, they separated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number>and Gerald moved out of Darlene\u2019s home at Chapel Apartments, 8221 Esther Place, Baltimore City. In 2004, when Chapel Apartments was sold, Darlene received a Section 8<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> voucher through the HABC\u2019s HCVP. Until late 2011, her participation in the HCVP was without incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-4\">On December 6, 2011, Darlene went to the HABC and requested that her son be removed from her HCVP household. At the same time, she asked that Gerald be added to the voucher because they had reconciled. Gerald \u201csigned some papers, including a Judicial Information System Screening Form, a Personal Declaration Form, an Authorization for the Release of Information/Privacy Act Notice, and a Citizenship Verification form,\u201d allowing the HABC to conduct a criminal background check.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-5\">By letter dated April 4, 2012, the HABC notified Darlene that her participation in the HCVP would be terminated \u201ceffective May 5, 2012.\u201d (Emphasis omitted). The letter went on to state, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b598-6\">The reason for the termination is <em>Tenant Non-ComplianeeViolation of Family Obligations/Unauthorized Occupant </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>... A background check from the Maryland Judiciary Case Search on Gerald Matthews Sr. lists his address as 3221 Esther Place, Baltimore, MD on three different occasions; January 5, 2004, January 3, 2011, and February 1, 2011.[<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>] All of the dates listed are incidents that happened prior to your attempt to add Gerald Matthews Sr. onto your subsidy. You failed to report to our office that Gerald Matthews Sr. reside [sic] in your household. Our records indicate that Gerald Matthews Sr. is not an authorized member of your household.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b599-4\">(Emphasis in original). Thereafter, Darlene exercised her right to request an informal hearing concerning the termination.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-5\">A hearing was held on May 16, 2012. In attendance were: Hearing Officer Tishea Irving; HABC counsel Jon Offley; HCVP representative Patricia Boyd; Darlene; Karen Wabecke, counsel for Darlene; Gerald; and Mr. Coucci, a representative for the landlord who testified as a witness for Darlene. Boyd confirmed that Darlene came to the HCVP office on December 6, 2011, to request that Gerald be added to her household. Boyd also presented Maryland Judiciary Case Search printouts to show that Gerald had used Darlene\u2019s address on three occasions. Offley did not present any testimony or documents on behalf of the HABC.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-6\">In response, Wabecke argued that Darlene\u2019s participation in the HCVP should not be terminated because she had been a model tenant for eight years. Wabecke noted that the HABC offered no evidence to show that Gerald \u201cresided with [Darlene] without authorization\u201d for seven years.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-7\">Darlene testified that Gerald \u201cdid not live with her at Esther Place until she requested that he be added to her voucher.\u201d Darlene explained that, while she and her husband were separated from 2002 until 2011, Gerald \u201cused her subsi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>dized address to receive mail from child support and VA[<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>] because he didn\u2019t have a stable address.\u201d Gerald corroborated Darlene\u2019s testimony and added that he lived with his son, Gerald Matthews Jr., at 306 East 24th Street \u201cfor several periods of time, over the last 10 years\u201d and with his other son, Shaun Matthews, for approximately three years between 2003-2011.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Gerald explained that he used Darlene\u2019s address for child support because \u201chis daughter\u2019s mother did not know where he lived, [but] ... knew where [Darlene] resided.\u201d In addition, Gerald stated that he used Darlene\u2019s address because \u201che knew she would receive his mail.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b600-4\">After hearing all of the testimony,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> the Hearing Officer found that the \u201cHABC has shown by a preponderance of the evidence that Darlene ... is not eligible for the HCVP because [she] failed to report change in family composition____\u201d By letter dated May 31, 2012, the Hearing Officer elaborated on her findings as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b600-6\">[T]he HCVP presented three separate documents where [Gerald] used 3221 Esther Place, Baltimore, MD as his primary residence prior to [Darlene\u2019s] attempt to add him. [Gerald] testified that he used [Darlene\u2019s] address off and on for several years. The Visitor\u2019s Policy in Chapter Six of The Administration Plan states that \u201cuse of the unit address as the visitor\u2019s current residence for any purpose that is not explicitly temporary shall be construed as permanent residence.\u201d The documents presented by the HCVP substantiated that [Gerald] used the address listed above for permanent mailing purposes; therefore, [Gerald] will be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>considered to be living in the unit as an unauthorized household member. I further note that during the hearing, [Gerald] testified that he used [Darlene\u2019s] address for mailing purposes because he knew he would receive his mail there and [Darlene] testified that she allowed her husband to use her address for mailing purposes because he didn\u2019t have a stable address. Both of these testimonies conflict with Exhibit 12, [Gerald\u2019s] award letter issued by the Social Security Administration listing 5002 Anthony Avenue, Baltimore, MD.[<footnotemark>7</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b601-4\">This is a violation of part 15 of the Administrative Plan. The composition of the assisted family residing in the unit must be approved by the HABC.... Therefore, it is the decision of this hearing officer to uphold the HABC\u2019s decision to terminate. This means Darlene [ ] is no longer a participant in the HCVP.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b601-5\">(Emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b601-6\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b601-7\">At the outset, we address the HABC\u2019s contention that CJP \u00a7 12-302(a) divests this Court of jurisdiction to hear Darlene\u2019s appeal. That section states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b601-8\">Unless a right to appeal is expressly granted by law, \u00a7 12-301 of this subtitle does not permit an appeal from a final judgment of a court entered or made in the exercise of appellate jurisdiction in reviewing the decision of the District Court, an administrative agency, or a local legislative body.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b601-9\">CJP \u00a7 12-302(a). According to the HABC, Darlene \u201cattempts] to appeal a final judgment of the circuit court made in the exercise of its statutory appellate jurisdiction under Maryland Rule 7-401 <em>et seq.\u201d </em>and, thus, this case is not properly before this Court. In advancing its argument, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>HABC creates a distinction between common law mandamus actions\u2014which the HABC concedes are reviewable by this Court\u2014and administrative mandamus actions\u2014which the HABC contends is the type of action found here. The HABC avers that, \u201cbecause no further appeal right is granted to [Darlene] ..., her appeal must be dismissed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b602-4\">In response, Darlene argues that mandamus actions are an exercise of original jurisdiction by the circuit courts and, therefore, are not subject to the limitations of CJP \u00a7 12-302(a). Darlene also notes that administrative mandamus remains a common law action that has not been codified in a statute and, accordingly, is reviewable by this Court. We agree with Darlene.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-5\">We have previously stated that \u201creview of [a hearing officer]\u2019s decision is possible through both administrative mandamus under Md. Rule 7-401(a) and the common law writ of mandamus.\u201d <em>Madison Park N. Apartments, L.P. v. Comm\u2019r of Hous. &amp; Cmty. Dev., </em>211 Md.App. 676, 694, 66 A.3d 93 <em>cert. granted, </em>434 Md. 311, 75 A.3d 317 (2013).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> This is distinguishable from circuit court statutory review cases, which are not reviewable by appellate courts. <em>See id. </em>(\u2018Where \u2018the substance of the circuit court action was a common law mandamus action\u2019 and not a statutory action for judicial review, the decision is \u2018appealable to the Court of Special Appeals under \u00a7 12-301 of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article.\u2019 \u201d) (Citations omitted). <em>See also Rogers v. Eastport Yachting Ctr., LLC, </em>408 Md. 722, 734, 971 A.2d 322 (2009) (affirming dismissal for lack of appellate jurisdiction where the circuit court proceeding was \u201ca statutory judicial review action\u201d and Petitioner did not seek \u201c \u2018mandamus\u2019 relief\u2019 from the circuit court); <em>Murrell v. Mayor &amp; City Council of Baltimore, </em>376 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>Md. 170, 185-86, 829 A.2d 548 (2003) (stating that this Court has no jurisdiction over \u201ca statutory judicial review action\u201d but can entertain \u201ca common law mandamus action\u201d); <em>Prince George\u2019s Cnty. v. Beretta U.S.A. Corp., </em>358 Md. 166, 183, 747 A.2d 647 (2000) (concluding that CJP \u00a7 12-302(a) precluded an appeal where the case involved \u201ca typical statutory judicial review action\u201d and not a mandamus proceeding); <em>Bucktail, LLC v. Cnty. Council of Talbot Cnty., </em>352 Md. 530, 542, 723 A.2d 440 (1999) (allowing appeal of circuit court\u2019s judicial review of county council\u2019s decision to deny a zoning amendment ordinance as it substantially sought a common law writ of mandamus); <em>Gisriel v. Ocean City Bd. of Sup\u2019rs of Elections, </em>345 Md. 477, 500, 693 A.2d 757 (1997) (holding that this Court had jurisdiction to entertain an appeal under CJP \u00a7 12-301 where the action was, in substance, a common law mandamus action); and <em>Perry v. Dep\u2019t of Health &amp; Mental Hygiene, </em>201 Md.App. 633, 30 A.3d 262 (2011) (reviewing administrative mandamus case filed pursuant to Md. Rule 7-401). The cases cited by the HABC, <em>Dvorak v. Anne Arundel Cnty. Ethics Comm\u2019n, </em>400 Md. 446, 456, 929 A.2d 185 (2007), and <em>Healthcare Strategies, Inc. v. Howard Cnty. Human Rights Comm\u2019n, </em>117 Md.App. 349, 700 A.2d 278 (1997), both involved statutory judicial review and are, therefore, distinguishable.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-4\">Alternatively, the HABC attempts to support its argument by creating a distinction between \u201ccommon law mandamus,\u201d which it admits is appealable to this Court, and \u201cadministrative mandamus,\u201d which it contends is the type found in this case and which we have no jurisdiction to review. As Darlene points out, however, this attempt by HABC lacks any legal support. The two types of common law mandamus actions\u2014 administrative and traditional\u2014arise when there is no statutorily-granted right to judicial review. Arnold Rochvarg, <em>Principles and Practice of Maryland Administrative Law </em>\u00a7 13.15 (2011). Administrative mandamus, which is set forth in Md. Rule 7-401, <em>et seq., </em>\u201cis the proper mandamus action when the agency decision being challenged is ... from a contested case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal footnote omitted). By contrast, a traditional mandamus action \u201cis used to review an agency action <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>that is not the product of a contested case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Both types, however, have specific rules of procedure which govern in circuit court, and both are subject to review by this Court. <em>See id. </em>at \u00a7 13.15-13.17. Because we see no merit in the HABC\u2019s argument, we conclude that this Court has jurisdiction to entertain this appeal, and we shall proceed to review the HABC\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-4\">When reviewing the decision of an administrative agency, \u201cthis Court reviews the agency\u2019s decision, not the circuit court\u2019s decision.\u201d <em>Long Green Valley Ass\u2019n v. Prigel Family Creamery, </em>206 Md.App. 264, 273, 47 A.3d 1087 (2012) (citation omitted). In so doing, \u201cwe are limited to determining if there is substantial evidence in the record as a whole to support the agency\u2019s finding and conclusions, and to determine if the administrative decision is premised upon an erroneous conclusion of law.\u201d <em>Balt. Police Dep\u2019t v. Ellsworth, </em>211 Md.App. 198, 207, 63 A.3d 1192 (citation omitted), <em>cert. granted, </em>432 Md. 466, 69 A.3d 474 (2013). Stated differently, \u201c[o]ur primary goal is to determine whether the agency\u2019s decision is in accordance with the law or whether it is arbitrary, illegal, and capricious.\u201d <em>Long Green Valley, </em>206 Md.App. at 274, 47 A.3d 1087 (citation omitted). \u201cIn applying the substantial evidence test, we must decide whether a reasoning mind reasonably could have reached the factual conclusion the agency reached.\u201d <em>Rideout v. Dep\u2019t of Pub. Safety &amp; Corr. Seros., </em>149 Md.App. 649, 656, 818 A.2d 250 (2003) (citation omitted). \u201cWhen deciding issues of law, however, our review is expansive, and we may substitute our judgment for that of the agency if there are erroneous conclusions of law.\u201d <em>Maryland Dep\u2019t of the Env\u2019t v. Ives, </em>136 Md.App. 581, 585, 766 A.2d 657 (2001) (citation omitted). As to error of law, this Court\u2019s review is <em>de novo. Taylor v. Harford Cnty. Dep\u2019t of Soc. Servs., </em>384 Md. 213, 223, 862 A.2d 1026 (2004) (applying <em>de novo </em>review to determine whether an Administrative Law Judge \u201capplied the correct legal standard in reaching his conclusion\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b605-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>In this case, the Hearing Officer found that the \u201cHABC has shown by a preponderance of the evidence that Darlene ... is not eligible for the HCVP because [she] failed to report change in family composition.... \u201d Specifically, the Hearing Officer concluded that Gerald \u201cused [Darlene\u2019s] address ... for permanent mailing purposes; [and] therefore ... will be considered to be living in the unit as an unauthorized household member.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b605-4\">Chapter 15 of the HABC\u2019s Administrative Plan (\u201cPlan\u201d)<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> sets forth the grounds for which a HCVP participant\u2019s assistance may be terminated. One enumerated basis for termination, and the one relied on by HABC in the instant case, is violation of family obligations. 24 C.F.R. \u00a7 982.552(c)(l)(i). Here, the HABC alleges that Darlene violated the family obligation which requires participants to obtain approval of changes in household composition from their State public housing agency (\u201cPHA\u201d). 24 C.F.R. \u00a7 982.551(h)(2). Nowhere in the HABC\u2019s Plan, however, does it state that termination from the HCVP is warranted when a non-household member <em>(i.e., </em>someone not physically living or residing in the house) uses the subsidized unit\u2019s address as his or her mailing address.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-6\">The case of <em>Driver v. Hous. Auth. of Racine County, </em>289 Wis.2d 727, 713 N.W.2d 670 (Ct.App.2006), is instructive. There, Andrea Driver and Dorothy Bizzle, both participants in the Housing Authority of Racine County\u2019s (\u201cHARC\u201d) HCVP, brought action against HARC, pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 (2005), after HARC terminated their Section 8 housing assistance benefits due to violations of \u201cfamily obligations.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 673-75. Specifically, HARC alleged that Driver and Bizzle violated family obligations because non-household members had been \u201cusing the[ir] address.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In Driver\u2019s case, the HARC relied solely on a police report listing the address of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>her friend, Shauna Stilo, as that of the subsidized unit. <em>Id. </em>at 674. In Bizzle\u2019s case, the HARC relied on a Department of Corrections document and police reports for two of her sons listing her address as theirs. <em>Id. </em>at 674-75. Additionally, Bizzle testified that her children \u201cuse her address when they go to jail.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 675. The HARC hearing officer issued decisions in both cases upholding the terminations stating that the participants \u201cviolated [their] tenant responsibility.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 674-75.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-4\">On review, the Court of Appeals of Wisconsin reversed the circuit court\u2019s dismissal of the participants\u2019 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 (2005) action against HARC, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b606-5\">[I]t is obvious from the record that HARC considered \u201cusing the address\u201d to mean something other than \u201cliving at the address.\u201d HARC\u2019s counsel referred to Bizzle\u2019s admission at the informal hearing that when her children go to jail, they use her address. Near as we can tell, this violation involves someone other than the tenant listing the tenant\u2019s address as either a mailing address or a place of residence. Of what HARC policy or regulation this conduct constitutes a violation remains a mystery. HARC does not refer to any [Department of Housing and Urban Development (\u201cHUD\u201d) ] regulation. Moreover, although throughout these proceedings HARC has referred to several documents in the record\u2014which Bizzle signed and which enumerate various rules she must follow\u2014as sources of \u201cfamily obligations,\u201d none of these documents indicates the existence of a \u201cusing the address\u201d violation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b606-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 680. Likewise, here, we perceive no violation of any HABC policy or HUD regulation which, when applied to the facts of the case, would warrant termination for violating family obligations.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-7\">Presumably unable to find any other provision for support, the Hearing Officer turned to the HABC\u2019s Visitor Policy to justify her decision. The Visitor Policy is the methodology by which a visitor is to be considered to be living in the unit as an unauthorized household member. Assuming its applicability, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>the Hearing Officer improperly applied the HABC Visitor Policy in reaching her conclusion that Gerald was an unauthorized household member.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-4\">The Visitor Policy states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b607-5\">\n<em>Visitors</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b607-6\">Any adult who has been in the unit more than 14 consecutive days without HABC approval, or a total of 90 days in a 12-month period, will be considered to be living in the unit as an unauthorized household member. Determination of the unauthorized status will include any of the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b607-7\">\u2022 Absence of evidence of any other address will be considered verification that the visitor is a member of the household.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b607-8\">\u2022 Statements from neighbors and/or the landlord will be considered in making the determination.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b607-9\">\u2022 Use of the unit address as the visitor\u2019s current residence for any purpose that is not explicitly temporary shall be construed as permanent residence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b607-10\">To rely on this policy, the Hearing Officer must do so in whole, not in part.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Her error was in failing to make a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>factual finding that Gerald was \u201cin the unit\u201d and, from there, determine if he was an unauthorized household member using the three determining factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-4\">At no time before or during the hearing did the HABC or HCVP establish that Gerald had \u201cbeen in the unit more than 14 consecutive days without HABC approval, or a total of 90 days in a 12-month period.\u201d For this same reason, the HABC\u2019s argument on appeal fails. Specifically, all of the HABC\u2019s contentions rest on the assumption that Gerald physically stayed in Darlene\u2019s home from 2004-2011, when in fact, the only evidence presented was that he used the address for mailing purposes. A finding of the second does not infer or prove the first. Therefore, the Hearing Officer\u2019s conclusion that because Gerald used the address for permanent mailing purposes, he would be considered to be living in the unit as an unauthorized household member was premised upon an erroneous conclusion of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-5\">For the foregoing reasons, we reverse HABC\u2019s decision to terminate Darlene\u2019s participation in the HCVP.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-6\">JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR BALTIMORE CITY REVERSED.

Under the HCVP, the Department of Housing and Urban Development (\"HUD\u201d) enters into contracts with, and provides funding to, state public housing agencies (\"PHAs\u201d), which in turn provide rental subsidies which low-income families use to rent housing in the private rental market. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1437f(o); <em>Walker v.

Our predominant mission is to ascertain and implement the legislative intent, which is to be derived, if possible, from the language of the statute (or Rule) itself. If the language is clear and unambiguous, our search for legislative intent ends and we apply the language as written and in a commonsense manner. <em>We do not add words or ignore those that are there. </em>If there is any ambiguity, we may then seek to fathom the legislative intent by looking at legislative history and applying the most relevant of the various canons that courts have created. <em>See generally State v.
