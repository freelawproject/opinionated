A vehicle driven by Adam Pond, pulled out of a driveway at 3269 Captain Dement Drive, striking Mr. and Mrs. Connors and knocking them to the ground. Mrs. Connors suffered minor physical injuries and significant emotional trauma, while Mr. Connors was injured severely, and he died on January 31, 2011. Mr. and Mrs. Connors were both \u201cinsureds\u201d under a motor vehicle policy issued by GEICO which provided uninsured motorist coverage (\u201cUIM\u201d) with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>policy limits of $300,000 per person/$300,000 per occurrence. The tortfeasor, Adam Pond, maintained automobile liability insurance through Allstate Insurance Company with liability limits of $100,000 per person/$300,000 per occurrence. With GEICO\u2019s consent, Mr. and Mrs. Connors accepted \u201cper person\u201d policy limits from Allstate, receiving $100,000 each, thereby exhausting the limits of the Allstate policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-5\">The Connorses submitted claims to GEICO pursuant to the UIM provisions of GEICO\u2019s Maryland Family Automobile Policy issued to Mr. Connors. GEICO asserted that, after crediting the policy for $200,000, which appellants received from Allstate, only $100,000 of UIM benefits remained. The Connorses disagreed with GEICO\u2019s calculation, contending that the \u201cper person\u201d limit of the policy should apply, leaving $300,000 in UIM benefits remaining.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-6\">The Connorses filed a claim with the Maryland Insurance Administration, pursuant to Maryland Code (1996, 2006 Repl. Vol., 2008 Cum.Supp.), \u00a7 27-1001 of the Insurance Article II (\u201cI.A. II\u201d),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> alleging that GEICO had failed to act in good faith in settling their claim. On July 22, 2010, the Maryland Insurance Administration issued a decision, finding that GEI-CO did not breach its obligation to act in good faith, and agreeing with GEICO that $100,000 of UIM coverage remained. GEICO subsequently tendered the Connorses the $100,000 it asserts is available according to the terms of the UIM policy, under an agreement that allows appellants to pursue their contention that $300,000 in benefits remain (inclusive of the $100,000 paid).</p>\n<p id=\"b444-7\">On December 16, 2010, Mr. and Mrs. Connors filed a lawsuit against GEICO, seeking declaratory relief in the Circuit Court for Montgomery County. After considering cross-motions for summary judgment, the circuit court granted summary judgment in favor of GEICO. The circuit court, in relevant part, stated as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b445-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>2. The GEICO Policy is not ambiguous. GEICO is obligated under GEICO Policy No. 0377-86-55-06 to make $100,000 in UIM benefits available to satisfy the claims of [appellants].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b445-4\">3. GEICO\u2019s remaining UIM obligation is calculated by taking its $300,000 \u201cper accident\u201d limit under the GEICO Policy and subtracting all amounts received by [appellants] that exhausted the tortfeasor\u2019s liability limits, which in this instance was $200,000. GEICO\u2019s remaining UIM obligation to [appellants] is to fill the \u201cgap\u201d between what [appellants] could have recovered from the tortfeasor had the tortfeasor maintained identical liability coverage to the coverage [appellants] purchased under the GEICO Policy. That \u201cgap\u201d is $100,000 which, as noted, has been paid.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b445-5\">Appellants noted this timely appeal.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b445-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b445-7\">When we review the decision of a circuit court granting summary judgment, we review that decision <em>de novo. Powell v. Breslin, </em>195 Md.App. 340, 345, 6 A.3d 360 (2010), <em>aff'd, </em>421 Md. 266, 26 A.3d 878 (2011). A trial court, when deciding a motion for summary judgment, may grant summary judgment if the motion and response show that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and that the party in whose favor the judgment is entered is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. <em>Id. </em>at 345-46, 6 A.3d 360. Where there is no dispute of material fact, our review focuses on whether the trial court\u2019s grant of the motion was legally correct. <em>Id. </em>at 346, 6 A.3d 360.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-8\">Appellants contend that the circuit court erred in interpreting the language of the GEICO insurance policy\u2019s UIM provisions. They argue that the plain language of the insurance contract allows for both Mrs. Connors and the estate of Mr. Connors to collect $300,000 pursuant to the policy\u2019s \u201cper person\u201d limits. Specifically, appellants contend that the policy\u2019s \u201csubject to\u201d language in subsection (2) of the \u201cLimits of Liability\u201d portion of Section IV support the \u201cper accident\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>limit as being subservient to the \u201cper person\u201d limit. Appellants assert that the UIM policy provides $800,000 \u201cper person\u201d worth of coverage irrespective of the limiting language $300,000 \u201cper occurrence.\u201d Because there were claims filed on behalf of two individuals, Mr. Connors and Mrs. Connors, appellants contend the UIM benefits calculation should start with a total of $600,000 in UIM coverage. Appellants agree that GEICO should receive credit for the $200,000 from Allstate\u2019s liability policy, but argue that this amount should be applied to the $600,000 figure, leaving $400,000. Finally, appellants conclude their calculation by using the $300,000 \u201cper accident\u201d limit as a \u201ccap\u201d on the $400,000 aggregate amount, thus entitling them to a total recovery from GEICO of $300,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-5\">GEICO responds that the language of the UIM policy is clear and unambiguous, mandating that $100,000 of UIM benefits remain available to appellants. GEICO asserts that the insurance contract states clearly that the \u201cper occurrence\u201d limit applies to claims of two or more people, and is to be reduced by all amounts paid by the tortfeasor, in aggregate. GEICO also argues that appellants\u2019 interpretation of the \u201csubject to\u201d language is flawed, because, when read properly, it functions to restrict an individual insured from collecting more than the \u201cper occurrence\u201d policy limit. GEICO further contends that, in order to interpret the insurance policy accurately, the contract must be read in context with Maryland\u2019s UIM statutory scheme and relevant case law. According to GEICO, appellants\u2019 conscious decision to purchase $300,000 in UIM coverage, viewed in accord with Maryland\u2019s UIM statute, represents \u201cthe amount that would place [appellants in the same position [as] if the tortfeasor had carried identical liability coverage.\u201d GEICO also contends that Maryland case law supports the \u201cper occurrence\u201d limit as the \u201cappropriate starting point\u201d for a UIM \u201cgap\u201d calculation. GEICO concludes that the circuit court was correct in finding that $100,000 of UIM benefits remain under the provisions of the insurance policy and in granting summary judgment in its favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>I.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-5\">UIM coverage \u201cplays a leading role in Maryland\u2019s comprehensive motor vehicle insurance scheme by assuring compensation for victims of noninsured or inadequately insured motorists.\u201d Andrew Janquitto, <em>Maryland Motor Vehicle Insurance </em>\u00a7 8.1, at 308 (3d ed.2011). Multiple amendments to the Maryland UIM statute evidence the increasing importance of UIM insurance within insurance law. UIM coverage first found its way into Maryland law in 1972. 1972 Md. Laws, Chap. 73, \u00a7 1; <em>see also </em>Janquitto, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 8.1, at 308. In 1975, the UIM statute was amended to require every motor vehicle insurance policy issued in Maryland to contain minimum uninsured motorist coverage. 1975 Md. Laws, Chap. 562, \u00a7 1; <em>see also Waters v. U.S. Fid. &amp; Guar. Co., </em>328 Md. 700, 710, 616 A.2d 884 (1992). In 1981, the UIM scheme was again amended to allow insureds the opportunity to contract for more than a minimum amount of UIM coverage. 1981 Md. Laws, Chap. 510; <em>see also Waters, </em>328 Md. at 711, 616 A.2d 884 (noting that by Chapter 510 of the 1981 Acts, the \u201cGeneral Assembly ... required that insurers shall [make] available to the insured the opportunity to contract for higher amounts\u201d (second alteration in original) (internal quotation marks omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b447-7\">Uninsured, and underinsured,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> motorist insurance is applicable when the limit of the tortfeasor\u2019s liability insurance policy is less than an insured\u2019s UIM coverage. <em>Waters, </em>328 Md. at 711-12, 616 A.2d 884. Maryland Code (1977, 2009 Repl. Vol.), \u00a7 17-103 of the Transportation Article II mandates that in Maryland, each motor vehicle liability policy contain a minimum of $20,000 coverage for injury or death of any one person in an accident, $40,000 in coverage for injury <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>or death of two or more people in an accident,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and a minimum of $15,000 in coverage for property damage resulting from any one accident. <em>See also </em>I.A. II \u00a7 19-509(e) (requiring that UIM coverage equal at least the amount required by Title 17 of the Transportation Article). The underlying purpose of Maryland\u2019s UIM scheme is to \u201cprovide an injured insured with resources equal to those which would have been available had the tortfeasor carried liability coverage equal to the amount of uninsured motorist coverage which the injured insured purchased from his own insurance company.\u201d <em>Waters, </em>328 Md. at 714, 616 A.2d 884. The statute permits insureds to contract for higher amounts than those provided under Title 17 of the Transportation Article provided these amounts do not exceed the amounts of the motor vehicle liability coverage provided by the policy. I.A. II \u00a7 19-509(e); <em>Hoffman v. United Servs. Auto. Ass\u2019n, </em>309 Md. 167, 178, 522 A.2d 1320 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b448-5\">We interpret the language of an insurance policy in accord with the same principles applicable to the construction of other contracts. <em>Mitchell v. AARP Life Ins. Program, N.Y. Life Ins. Co., </em>140 Md.App. 102, 116, 779 A.2d 1061 (2001). Like any other contract, an insurance contract is \u201cmeasured by its terms unless a statute, a regulation, or public policy is violated thereby.\u201d <em>Pac. Indem. Co. v. Interstate Fire &amp; Cas. Co., </em>302 Md. 383, 388, 488 A.2d 486 (1985). The words of an insurance contract are given their customary, ordinary, and accepted meaning. <em>Beale v. Am. Nat\u2019l Lawyers Ins. Reciprocal, </em>379 Md. 643, 660, 843 A.2d 78 (2004). The ordinary meaning of a word is determined by what a reasonably prudent lay person would attach to it. <em>Id. </em>When a court finds that the contractual language is plain and unambiguous, the court will enforce the terms as a matter of law. <em>Pac. Indem. Co., </em>302 Md. at 389, 488 A.2d 486. If the language of an insurance contract is ambiguous, however, the court may turn to extrinsic evidence to determine the intent of the parties. <em>Clendenin Bros. v. U.S. Fire Ins. Co., </em>390 Md. 449, 459, 889 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>A.2d 387 (2006). Maryland does not follow the rule that some of our sister states apply that an insurance policy should, as a matter of course, be construed against the insurer. <em>Megonnell v. U.S. Auto. Ass\u2019n, </em>368 Md. 633, 655, 796 A.2d 758 (2002). If ambiguous, however, an insurance policy \u201c \u201cwill be construed liberally in favor of the insured and against the insurer as drafter of the instrument.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 655-56, 796 A.2d 758 (emphasis omitted) (quoting <em>Dutta v. State Farm Ins. Co., </em>363 Md. 540, 556, 769 A.2d 948 (2001)).</p>\n<p id=\"b449-5\">The pertinent provisions of the GEICO policy are set forth below:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b449-6\">\u201cSECTION IV\u2014UNINSURED MOTORISTS COVERAGE</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b449-7\">LIMITS OF LIABILITY</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b449-8\">Regardless of the number of <em>insureds, </em>autos or trailers to which this policy applies:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b449-10\">1. The limit of liability for Uninsured Motorists coverage stated in the Declarations as applicable to \u201ceach person\u201d is the limit of our liability for all damages, including those for care or loss of services, due to bodily injury sustained by one person as the result of one accident.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b449-11\">2. The limit of liability for Uninsured Motorists coverage stated in the Declarations as applicable to \u201ceach accident\u201d is, subject to the above provision respecting each person, the total limit of our liability for all such damages including damages for care and loss of services, due to <em>bodily injury </em>sustained by two or more persons as the result of one accident.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b449-12\">4.....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b449-13\">The amount payable under this coverage will be reduced by all amounts:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b450-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>(a) Paid by or for all persons or organizations liable for the injury....\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b450-5\">(Emphasis added) (bold italics in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b450-6\">Appellants contend that the appropriate benefits calculation begins with subsection (1), which mandates a $300,000 limit for \u201ceach person\u201d resulting from \u201cone accident.\u201d Appellants argue that the \u201csubject to\u201d language in subsection (2) makes the $300,000 limit governing \u201ceach accident\u201d subservient to the $300,000 limit for \u201ceach person\u201d from subsection (1). Appellants\u2019 reading of the insurance contract would allow an additional recovery of up to $200,000 for Mrs. Connors individually and an additional recovery of up to $200,000 for the estate of Mr. Connors. Appellants further argue that failing to give meaning to the \u201csubject to\u201d language of subsection (2) would allow GEICO to \u201cavoid paying benefits it otherwise agreed to pay.\u201d To provide additional clarity, appellants argue that the UIM benefits should be calculated as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b450-7\">Estate of Mr. Connors:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b450-8\">GEICO UIM Coverage $300,000 per person</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b450-9\">Payment from Tortfeasor ($100,000 per person)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b450-10\">GEICO Coverage Remaining $200,000 per person</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b450-11\">Mrs. Connors:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b450-12\">GEICO UIM Coverage $300,000 per person</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b450-13\">Payment from Tortfeasor ($100,000 per person)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b450-14\">GEICO Coverage Remaining $200,000 per person</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b450-15\">Appellants conclude that by utilizing the per accident limitation of $300,000 as a cap on the above-calculated $400,000 aggregate amount, they are ultimately entitled to $300,000 in remaining UIM benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-16\">GEICO counters that \u201csubsection (2) is the starting point, not subsection (1), because the claims involve injuries \u2018sustained by two or more persons as the result of one accident.\u2019 \u201d GEICO argues that using subsection (2) as a starting point, the per accident limit of $300,000 is reduced by the $200,000 received from the tortfeasor, leaving $100,000 in UIM benefits available to appellants. GEICO contends that the \u201csubject to\u201d language of subsection (2), when read properly, further limits <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>liability pertaining to one accident involving one person. To provide additional clarity, GEICO argues that the UIM benefits should be calculated as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b451-4\">Estate of Mr. Connors and Mrs. Connors Individually:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b451-5\">GEICO UIM Coverage $300,000 per accident</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b451-6\">Payment from Tortfeasor ($200,000 in aggregate)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b451-7\">GEICO Coverage Remaining $100,000 per accident</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AOy\">We agree with GEICO.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-8\">The plain language of subsections (1) and (2) of GEICO\u2019s insurance policy, indicates the correct starting point for calculations of UIM benefits and the corresponding coverage limitation. The decisive factor, in our view, is the number of injured insureds claiming under the policy. Subsection (1) clearly states that it is applicable to \u201cbodily injury sustained by one person as the result of one accident.\u201d It follows logically that, if one insured is injured as the result of one accident, subsection (1) limits the liability of the insurer to the coverage limits pertaining to \u201ceach person.\u201d For example, if Mrs. Connors was the only person injured in the accident, subsection (1) would be the appropriate starting point for the UIM benefits calculation, limiting GEICO\u2019s liability to the policy\u2019s \u201ceach person\u201d limit of $300,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-9\">Conversely, the unambiguous language of subsection (2) makes it applicable to \u201cbodily injury sustained by two or more persons as the result of one accident.\u201d Therefore, if two or more insureds are injured as the result of one accident, subsection (2) will apply to limit the liability of the insurer to the coverage limits relating to \u201ceach accident.\u201d When subsection (2) is the starting point for a claim, the \u201csubject to\u201d qualifying clause functions to further limit the liability of the insurer. Subsection (2) sets the \u201ceach accident\u201d limitation for an injury involving two or more insureds, which is then further restricted by the \u201ceach person\u201d limit of subsection (1). The qualifying clause does not subvert or modify the hierarchy of the subsections, as appellant contends, but rather acts to incorporate the limiting language of subsection (1) into subsection (2), providing a further restriction on liability. The result is two layers of limitation\u2014subsection (2) initially limits liabili<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>ty to the \u201ceach accident\u201d amount, and then liability is further limited by the \u201ceach person\u201d amount. For example, the instant case involves two injured insureds, Mr. and Mrs. Connors, who asserted UIM claims arising from a single accident. Because two insureds were injured, the correct starting point for a UIM calculation is subsection (2), which mandates GEICO\u2019s liability is the \u201ceach accident\u201d limit of $800,000. The \u201csubject to\u201d qualifying clause, as described previously, incorporates the \u201ceach person\u201d limit of subsection (1) into subsection (2), further limiting GEICO\u2019s \u201ceach accident\u201d liability. Because the \u201ceach person\u201d limit in GEICO\u2019s policy is $300,000, subsection (1) does not provide any further limit on GEICO\u2019s liability. Thus the \u201ceach accident\u201d limit of $300,000 applies.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-4\">Appellants\u2019 contention that the \u201cper accident\u201d limitation of subsection (2) is \u201csubject to\u201d the \u201cper person\u201d limitation of subsection (1) arises out of their reading the contract provisions chronologically in the order of subsection (1) followed by subsection (2). Although appropriate with some contracts, this is not the manner in which the GEICO provisions were intended to be navigated. As stated above, the <em>number </em>of injured insureds is the crucial factor when determining in which paragraph the calculation originates, not the numeral preceding the contract provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-5\">We find no controlling precedent narrowly tailored to the facts of the instant matter. The Court of Appeals\u2019 decision in <em>Waters v. U.S. Fidelity &amp; Guaranty Co., </em>however, is instructive when considering issues involving Maryland\u2019s UIM statutory scheme. In <em>Waters, </em>Schreier drove a pickup truck across the center line and collided with a vehicle driven by Dunham. 328 Md. at 705, 616 A.2d 884. Waters was a passenger in the truck, and Waters carried UIM coverage with limits of $100,000 per person/$300,000 per accident. <em>Id. </em>at 706, 616 A.2d 884. Schreier maintained automobile liability insurance with limits of $100,000 per person/$100,000 per accident. <em>Id. </em>When $97,000 of Schreier\u2019s $100,000 liability policy was exhausted to cover injuries to Dunham, Waters filed a UIM claim to recover damages, which was denied by his insurer. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number><em>Id. </em>The trial court found that Schreier was not uninsured and therefore Waters could not collect under his policy for uninsured motorists. <em>Id. </em>at 707, 616 A.2d 884.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-5\">The Court of Appeals discussed the legislative intent underlying Maryland\u2019s UIM statute, while additionally contrasting the gap theory of recovery with the excess theory of recovery.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 710-13 &amp; n. 5, 616 A.2d 884. The Court found that the purpose of Maryland\u2019s current UIM statute is to \u201cprovide an injured insured with resources equal to those which would have been available had the tortfeasor carried liability coverage equal to the amount of uninsured motorist coverage which the injured insured purchased from his own insurance company.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 714, 616 A.2d 884. The Court concluded that Schreier was underinsured compared to Waters, taking into account the $300,000 per accident limit on Waters\u2019 UIM policy, thus allowing Waters to proceed against his insurer pursuant to the $100,000 per person limit. <em>Id. </em>at 714-15, 616 A.2d 884.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-6\">In <em>Hoffman v. United Services Automobile Ass\u2019n, </em>the Court of Appeals considered recovery under supplemental UIM coverage in excess of the statutorily required amount. 309 Md. at 171, 522 A.2d 1320. The Hoffmans had purchased an automobile policy which included the statutorily required UIM coverage, and additionally, a supplemental UIM policy with limits of $300,000 per person/$500,000 per accident. <em>Id. </em>at 169, 522 A.2d 1320. Mrs. Hoffman was killed and Mr. Hoffman was seriously injured during an automobile accident, as passengers, in a vehicle driven by Whelan. <em>Id. </em>After recovering from the tortfeasor\u2019s liability policy and Whelan\u2019s UIM policy, Mr. Hoffman sought additional compensation under his supplemental UIM policy. <em>Id. </em>at 169-70, 522 A.2d 1320. Mr. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>Hoffman\u2019s UIM provider denied the claim, arguing that an insured could not recover on a duplicative basis subsequent to receiving in excess of the statutory m\u00ednimums from other insurance sources. <em>Id. </em>at 170, 522 A.2d 1320. The Court of Appeals found in favor of Mr. Hoffman recovering from his supplemental UIM policy, concluding that the General Assembly intended to make \u201c \u2018available to the insured the opportunity to contract for higher amounts than those provided under Title 17 of the Transportation Article ... if these amounts do not exceed the amounts of the motor vehicle liability coverage provided by the policy.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 178, 522 A.2d 1320 (quoting Md.Code (1972, 1981 Repl. Vol.), Art. 48A \u00a7 541(c)(2)).</p>\n<p id=\"b454-5\">In support of their position, appellants rely on the North Carolina case of <em>Aills v. Nationwide Mut. Ins. Co., </em>88 N.C.App. 595, 363 S.E.2d 880 (1988). Mr. and Mrs. Aills were severely injured in an automobile accident in which the at-fault driver maintained liability insurance of $50,000 per person/$100,000 per accident. <em>Id. </em>at 881-82. The trial court awarded the Aillses over $650,000 in combined damages. <em>Id. </em>at 881. The tortfeasor\u2019s liability insurance was exhausted under the per person limits, paying Mr. and Mrs. Aills $50,000 each. <em>Id. </em>The Aillses each made a claim under Mr. Aills\u2019s UIM policy which provided coverage limits of $100,000 per person/$100,000 per accident. <em>Id. </em>The UIM insurer denied the Aillses\u2019 claims, contending that the tortfeasor\u2019s insurance had paid $100,000 in aggregate, and no further payment was due. <em>Id. </em>at 881-82. The insurance policy contained the following language, limiting the insurer\u2019s liability:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b454-6\">The limit of bodily injury liability shown in the Declarations for \u201ceach person\u201d for Uninsured Motorists Coverage is our maximum limit of liability for all damages for bodily injury sustained by any one person in any one auto accident. Subject to this limit for \u201ceach person\u201d, the limit of bodily injury liability shown in the Declarations for \u201ceach accident\u201d for Uninsured Motorists Coverage is our maximum limit of liability for all damages for bodily injury resulting from any one accident.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b455-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number><em>Id. </em>at 882. The Court of Appeals of North Carolina found the language susceptible to differing interpretations, and therefore construed the provision against the insurance company. <em>Id. </em>The court concluded that the \u201csubject to\u201d language made the \u201ceach accident\u201d limit subordinate to the \u201ceach person\u201d limit, entitling the Allises to an additional recovery of $50,000 each. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b455-4\">In further support of their argument, appellants cite <em>Austin Mut. Ins. Co. v. King, </em>29 F.3d 385 (8th Cir.1994). There, the tortfeasor, Leichtenberg, ran a stop sign and hit a car driven by King. <em>Id. </em>at 386. King and two of her passengers were seriously injured, while three other passengers in her car died as a result of the accident. <em>Id. </em>Leichtenberg\u2019s automobile liability policy, with limits of $50,000 per person/$100,000 per accident, was exhausted by dividing the $100,000 per accident limit between the six occupants of King\u2019s vehicle. <em>Id. </em>King maintained a UIM policy with coverage limits of $50,000 per person/$100,000 per accident. <em>Id. </em>The policy contained the following language:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b455-5\">The limit of liability ... is [insurance company\u2019s] maximum limit of liability for all damages, including damages for care, loss of services or death, arising out of \u201cbodily injury\u201d sustained by any one person in any one accident. Subject to this limit for each person, the limit of liability ... is our maximum limit of liability for all damages for \u201cbodily injury\u201d resulting from any one accident.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b455-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 388 (first and third alterations in original). The Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit held that the policy\u2019s \u201csubject to\u201d language dictated that the per person limit applied, and the per accident limit on the coverage acted only as a cap to the aggregate recovery. <em>Id. </em>at 388-89. King and each of her passengers would recover $50,000 per person from the UIM insurer (less the amount received from the tortfeasor), subject to an aggregate maximum of $100,000 (the per accident limit). <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b455-7\">Appellants\u2019 reliance on <em>Mills </em>and <em>King </em>is misplaced. The limiting provisions in both <em>Aills </em>and <em>King </em>are clearly distin<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>guishable from the limiting provision in GEICO\u2019s policy in the case <em>sub judice. </em>The limiting provisions of the GEICO policy are structured in subsections; subsection (1) applies unequivocally to accidents involving one insured and subsection (2) applies unequivocally to accidents involving two or more insureds. The \u201csubject to\u201d language in the GEICO policy appears as a qualifying clause within subsection (2), located in between two commas. In contrast, the limiting provisions in <em>Aills </em>and <em>King </em>consist of a single paragraph with the \u201csubject to\u201d language at the beginning of a sentence. <em>Aills, </em>363 S.E.2d at 882; <em>King, </em>29 F.3d at 388. The provisions in <em>Aills </em>and <em>King </em>establish liability limits based on one person and limit that amount using the per accident limit. <em>Aills, </em>363 S.E.2d at 882; <em>King, </em>29 F.3d at 388-89. This is materially different from the limiting provision in GEICO\u2019s policy, which establishes the applicable limitation based on the number of injured insureds making UIM claims. The structure of the provisions in <em>Aills </em>and <em>King, </em>the location of the \u201csubject to\u201d language, and the method of determining liability limits is substantially different from that of the GEICO provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-5\">Moreover, as to <em>Aills, </em>the North Carolina UIM statutory framework is distinguishable from Maryland. The North Carolina UIM statute mandated two specific steps evidencing the legislature\u2019s intent as to what coverage limit applies: \u201c(1) the number of claimants seeking coverage under the UIM policy; and (2) whether the negligent driver\u2019s liability policy was exhausted pursuant to a per-person or per-accident cap.\u201d <em>N.C. Farm Bureau Mut. Ins. Co. v. Gurley, </em>139 N.C.App. 178, 532 S.E.2d 846, 848, <em>review denied, </em>352 N.C. 675, 545 S.E.2d 427 (2000). The second prong of the North Carolina statute, as interpreted by the court in <em>North Carolina Farm Bureau Mutual Insurance Co. v. Gurley, </em>required the per accident limit of the UIM policy to govern when the per accident limit of the tortfeasor\u2019s liability policy was used, and required the per person limit of the UIM policy to govern when the per person limit of the tortfeasor\u2019s liability policy was used. <em>Id. </em>at 849. In the case <em>sub judice, </em>I.A. II \u00a7 19-509 fails to provide <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>the level of statutory guidance as does the North Carolina UIM statute when determining what coverage limit applies.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-5\">In sum, there is no available case law which is identical on the facts and law to the instant matter. The Maryland case law sufficiently supports our analysis of the GEICO policy language, while the out-of-state precedent offered by appellants lacks factual and statutory similarities to contradict our decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-7\">Assuming <em>arguendo </em>that the language of the GEICO insurance contract is ambiguous, we conclude that the result would remain unchanged. I.A. II \u00a7 19-509, contains the following provision which limits liability to an insurer:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b457-8\">\u201c(g) <em>Limit of insurer </em>liability.\u2014The limit of liability for an insurer that provides uninsured motorist coverage under this section is the amount of that coverage less the amount paid to the insured, that exhausts any applicable liability insurance policies, bonds, and securities, on behalf of any person that may be held liable for the bodily injuries or death of the insured.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b457-9\">This provision of the uninsured motorist statute explains how to calculate policy benefits. <em>See Aetna Cas. &amp; Sur. Co. v. Souras, </em>78 Md.App. 71, 78, 552 A.2d 908 (1989) (noting that the statutory predecessor to I.A. II \u00a7 19-509(g) \u201cprovides a formula for calculating the amount of uninsured motorist coverage\u201d). The Court of Appeals in <em>Waters </em>eliminated any remaining ambiguity surrounding Maryland\u2019s method of UIM calculation stating as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b457-10\">The two main theories are that underinsured motorist coverage provides \u201cexcess\u201d coverage and that underinsured motorist coverage is \u201cgap\u201d coverage.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b457-11\">Under the \u201cexcess\u201d theory a tortfeasor is underinsured when the injured party\u2019s damages exceed the tortfeasor\u2019s liability coverage.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b458-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>Under the \u201cgap\u201d theory a tortfeasor is underinsured when the injured party\u2019s uninsured motorist coverage exceeds the tortfeasor\u2019s liability coverage.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b458-4\">Maryland is a \u201cgap\u201d theory State....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b458-5\">328 Md. at 712 n. 5, 616 A.2d 884 (citations omitted). Accordingly, in Maryland, a gap theory state, the injured insured may recover the difference between his or her UIM coverage and money received from the tortfeasor. <em>Id. </em>In <em>Colonial Ins. Co. of Cal. v. Batson, </em>85 Md.App. 467, 475 n. 1, 584 A.2d 137 (1991), this Court found that, when calculating UIM benefits under a gap theory, \u201cthe insured is covered to the extent of his policy less the amount of insurance paid by the tortfeasor\u2019s carrier.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b458-6\">Appellants agree that Maryland is a gap theory state, but contend that the court \u201cmisapplied the \u2018gap theory1 in calculating the UIM benefits owed to [them].\u201d Appellants contend that GEICO should not receive credit for \u201call payments made by the tortfeasor\u2019s carrier,\u201d but instead, \u201ccredit is to be based on what each person receives.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b458-7\">GEICO counters that, pursuant to the gap theory of recovery, appellants should receive the difference between the \u201cper occurrence\u201d UIM policy limits ($300,000) and what the tortfeasor\u2019s liability insurance paid ($200,000). GEICO contends that it should receive credit for the full $200,000 paid by the tortfeasor\u2019s liability insurance, because a finding to the contrary would be pursuant to the \u201cexcess theory,\u201d which Maryland does not follow. We agree with GEICO that the gap theory was applied correctly by the trial court, and $100,000 in UIM coverage remains available to appellants.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-8\">Accepting appellants\u2019 rationale of how to calculate UIM benefits using gap theory would result in consequences unintended by the Maryland General Assembly. Appellants\u2019 method of calculation creates two possible outcomes of recovery, which would vary, depending on the tortfeasor\u2019s status as: (1) completely uninsured/equally insured, or (2) underinsured. To illustrate this inconsistency, assume that appellants maintained identical UIM coverage ($300,000 per person/$300,000 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>per accident), but were instead involved in an accident with a completely uninsured tortfeasor. Using appellants\u2019 methodology, they would recover $300,000 for each person injured ($600,000 total), subject to a maximum of $300,000 per accident, leaving them with a total recovery of $300,000. A second scenario exists in which the tortfeasor is equally insured with identical liability limits to appellants\u2019 UIM limits. This outcome would again consist of appellants receiving $300,000 in compensation from the tortfeasor\u2019s insurance company, although not being able to recover from their UIM insurer due to not being underinsured. Contrast the two aforementioned examples with the actual scenario, in which appellants were involved in an accident with a tortfeasor who was underinsured. Appellants assert that, after crediting the UIM policy for the $200,000 paid by the tortfeasor\u2019s insurance company, they are still entitled to $300,000 in UIM coverage. This provides appellants with a total recovery of $500,000 when the tortfeasor is underinsured, but only $300,000 when the tortfeasor is completely uninsured or equally insured. This logic would effectively create two categories of UIM recovery: a premium recovery when the tortfeasor is underinsured and a lesser recovery when the tortfeasor is completely uninsured or equally insured. We find no evidence from the statute, or pragmatic support, to indicate that the legislature intended varying recoveries based on the tortfeasor\u2019s comparative insurance level.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-5\">In <em>Gurley, </em>the North Carolina Court of Appeals faced a similar situation. The defendants in <em>Gurley </em>proposed a similar theory of recovery to that proposed by appellants and the court noted the unintended consequences that would result stating as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b459-6\">For example, if Mr. Fornes\u2019 liability coverage had been 50/100 instead of 25/50, defendants would not have been entitled to any UIM coverage because his automobile would not have been an \u201cunderinsured highway vehicle.\u201d Thus, defendants would have received $100,000 total in liability coverage from his carrier. Likewise, if Mr. Fornes had been uninsured altogether, defendants would have again <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>recovered a total of $100,000, this time in uninsured motorist (\u201cUM\u201d) coverage. But under defendants\u2019 espoused interpretation, they would be entitled to $50,000 in liability coverage and $100,000 in UIM coverage, for a grand total of $150,000 in compensation. This would give defendants a windfall simply because they were involved in an accident with an underinsured motorist, as opposed to an insured or uninsured motorist. We do not believe our legislature intended such a result. After all, the purpose of UM and UIM insurance is the same\u2014\u201cto compensate innocent victims of financially irresponsible motorists.\u201d Since the purpose is the same, no windfall should be created as between the two.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b460-5\">532 S.E.2d at 849 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b460-6\">In sum, we affirm the circuit court\u2019s grant of summary judgment in favor of GEICO, holding that the clear and unambiguous language of the GEICO insurance policy leaves GEICO with a remaining obligation to appellants of $100,000, which has been satisfied.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-7\">JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR MONTGOMERY COUNTY AFFIRMED.
