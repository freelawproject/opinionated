Woodburn\u2019s Licensing History</p>\n<p id=\"b568-5\">Woodburn\u2019s name, ownership, location and licensing classification have not remained static over the years. As far as this controversy is concerned, Woodburn\u2019s Food Market began life in 1945 as the successor to the Lusby Variety Store, a 20 x 80 foot premises, which had a Class B (on sale) beer license that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>was transferred to Woodburn\u2019s. Although the time line is a little unclear over the next few decades, Woodburn\u2019s was granted a change from its Class B license to a Class A (off sale)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> beer license, which was used at Woodburn\u2019s Food Market in Solomons Island.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b569-4\">In 1988, the licensee applied to transfer the Class A license to a new location in Solomons Island, one containing 9,225 square feet in Patuxent Plaza on Route 2 and this transfer was approved by the Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-5\">From 1945 to 1992, Woodburn\u2019s Food Market was operated by Benjamin F. Woodburn or his family. However, in 1992 the business was sold to Thomas F. McKay, Elizabeth Johnson and Susan Jones and the license was transferred to Woodburn\u2019s Beverage, Inc., an entity created by the three new owners. The name of Woodburn\u2019s Food Market was retained.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-6\">In June of 2010, Woodburn\u2019s applied for a Class B beer and wine license (on sale).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The application indicated that the food market had grown to 16,000 square feet. The Board granted the license change, however, with a restriction that did not permit the sale of wine \u201coff sale.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b569-7\">Finally, on June 1, 2011, Woodburn\u2019s applied for a Class A beer and wine license. The premises described in the application was that of the Food Lion in Lusby. Thus, Woodburn\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>sought a transfer of the proposed license to the Food Lion premises. The proposed transfer was the subject of a hearing before the Board on June 23, 2011.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-4\">2. Proceeding Before the Board</p>\n<p id=\"b570-5\">The principal issue before the Board was whether the transfer to the Food Lion premises ran afoul of the chain store/supermarket law. Woodburn\u2019s counsel noted that it only sought to transfer the location of the licensee and that there was no change in ownership in Woodburn\u2019s Beverage, Inc. \u201c[A]ll we\u2019re doing is moving from one supermarket to another supermarket.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b570-6\">At the time of the hearing, Woodburn\u2019s Food Market had been forced to close. Woodburn\u2019s attorney observed that the closing was caused by \u201cincreased competition.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b570-7\">McKay testified that when he acquired the food market in 1992, it was a \u201csupermarket\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b570-8\">Yes, it was a supermarket. Many would describe it as a neighborhood supermarket. The Food Marketing Institute of the United States classifies food stores in, basically, three categories. A grocery store is either a supermarket, which are larger than grocery stores, that range from about 10,000 square feet all the way up to almost an unlimited number, and then the second, another classification, or smaller grocery stores, really are called produce markets. And if you\u2019re not a produce market, then you are considered a small grocery store where you sell snacks, and beverages and sandwiches, you are considered a convenience store. So, as defined by the Food Market Institute and certainly the standards of the industry at the time, Woodburn\u2019s was a supermarket. As a matter of fact, at the time, most supermarkets were ranging in the size of 15,000 square feet in this country. Woodburn\u2019s was just over 10,000 square feet <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>so it was certainly, at that time, considered a supermarket, and still is today.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b571-4\">He went on to note that both Woodburn\u2019s and Food Lion were supermarkets:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b571-5\">We sell basically the same product and that is a breakdown of what Woodburn\u2019s percentage of those products are and that\u2019s a breakdown of what Food Lion\u2019s percentage of those products are. And you can see they are generally the same. Food Lion sells more groceries than we do, dry groceries, but they probably sell more dry groceries than any supermarket because they give a lot of credit on prices for groceries, dry groceries, but not so much credit for price on the other items. And you can see that their percentage of sale for deli and bakery and produce is either better or as good as Food Lion because a lot of customers buy staple groceries at Food Lion and would come to us for produce or meat or deli and bakery products. But both the Food Lion store and the Woodburn\u2019s stores are comparable in size, overall size. Woodburn\u2019s is approximately twenty thousand square feet and Food Lion is thirty nine thousand square feet.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b571-6\">McKay testified that Woodburn\u2019s was leasing space in the Food Lion. His counsel described the arrangement between Food Lion and Woodburn\u2019s as to checkouts.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b571-7\">... Food Lion is going to be handling the transactions, running it through their computer system. They are going to be actually handling the day to day sales, under the oversight of Woodburn\u2019s. So you\u2019ll be checking out through the Food Lion register and it will be tracked through the computer what is alcohol and what is not alcohol.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b571-8\">Woodburn\u2019s counsel argued that there was no legal prohibition to the transfer because the chain store/supermarket law \u201cdoes not apply to or affect ... any business established already holding such a license. That\u2019s where we are.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b571-9\">The transfer request was opposed by some witnesses. One, the daughter of the original owners of Woodburn\u2019s Food <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>Market; a representative of the Calvert County Chamber of Commerce; and Patuxent Wine and Spirits.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-4\">Patuxent\u2019s representative said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b572-5\">[Ljet\u2019s say it was the same license for the entire period, the question is not just is it grandfathered, but is it being transferred to a similar establishment. I\u2019ve listened to everything I\u2019ve heard tonight and I don\u2019t think it could be more dissimilar. You are taking a local license, owned by a local licensee for a long period of time in an independent store and, in effect, you are handing it to the management of a nationwide, at least regional, chain store. 1300 stores according to their website. I don\u2019t think it could be more dissimilar. The operation of the Food Lion is, I mean it\u2019s a shell, you\u2019re moving the shell entity of Woodburn\u2019s into the Food Lion. You\u2019ve got Food Lion running it, Food Lion stocking the shelves, Food Lion checking it out.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b572-6\">The Board did not rule on the transfer until August 25, 2011, after some Board membership had changed. At that hearing, Board member Swoap stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b572-7\">I move that this Board find that according to Section 9-102 of Article 2B there is a general prohibition against having liquor licenses associated with so called supermarkets, discount houses and chain stores. Specifically, Section 9-102(al) prevents a Class A, B, or D license from being transferred or issued to, or for use in conjunction with, or upon the premises of chain stores, discount houses or supermarkets. Further, Section 9-102(al) provides for an exemption from this general prohibition for any such license already in existence at the time of enactment of this statute in 1962. I move that the Board find that the Lusby Food Lion is in fact a supermarket and/or chain store as defined within Article 2B. I move that the Board find that the license subject to this transfer request is a Class B, Beer and Wine on sale license issued by this Board to Thomas F. McKay, Elizabeth Johnson and Susan Jones by way of conversion of class of license on or about July 22, 2010 thereby making it subject to the general prohibitions con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>tained within Section 9-102(a). For the preceding findings I move that the request by Thomas F. McKay, Elizabeth Johnson and Susan Jones to transfer location of its license to the Lusby Food Lion be denied.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b573-4\">After the Board adopted these findings, Woodburn\u2019s sought review of this decision in the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-5\">3. Proceedings in the Circuit Court</p>\n<p id=\"b573-6\">Woodburn\u2019s petitioned for review in the circuit court. The court took additional evidence and subsequently issued a written opinion and order upholding the Board\u2019s action. The opinion authored by Judge James Lombardi noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b573-7\">Overriding this case is the applicability of a statute that provides a grandfather clause contained in Article 2B Section 9-102(a-l). For purposes of this case, this clause provides that a Class A license may not be granted or transferred to any supermarket unless the business establishment seeking the transfer is \u201calready holding such a license or the possibility of such licensee having the license transferred to a similar type of business establishment.\u201d Therefore, two conditions must be met in order to avail the Petitioner of the protection of the grandfather clause.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AJl\">Petitioner contends that the history of the Board\u2019s actions in granting his business a freedom of interchanges between Class A and B licenses places him squarely within the contemplation of the statute and the exemption set forth in the grandfather clause. In short the Petitioner argues that it is immaterial as to whether his current license was Class B or Class A. The Board disagreed and held that holding a Class A license was a prerequisite to its approval; that the only license that the statute grandfathered was, in his case, a Class A license; and that since he held a Class B license he was required to apply for a completely different class of license.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b573-8\">The second condition of the grandfather clause is that the license had to be transferred to a similar type of business establishment. Although the evidence before the Liquor Board showed that the transferor was a small foodmarket <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>and the prospective transferee a large supermarket, the Petitioner contends that the Board never addressed this condition. Similarly, neither the Board nor the other opponent to the transfer addressed this condition. Accordingly, the Petitioner contends that neither should the Court in its judicial review.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b574-4\">The court\u2019s opinion went on to conclude:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b574-5\">The Liquor Board did address the \u201csimilar business type\u201d condition. Perhaps not artfully, but as the Court reads the Board\u2019s (short) motion disapproving the transfer, the Board made two distinct findings of fact: \u201cI move that the Board find that the Lusby Food Lion is in fact a supermarket as defined within Article 2B. I move that [sic] Board find that the license subject to this transfer request is a Class B Beer and Wine on sale license ... thereby making it subject to the general prohibitions contained within section 9-102(a-D.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b574-7\">Accordingly, the Court need not address the Petitioner\u2019s (and apparently, the opposition\u2019s) principal argument as to the differences, <em>vel non, </em>between a Class A and Class B license because the Court finds substantial evidence that the Board denied the license because it found that the transferee was a supermarket and therefore outside of at least one condition of the grandfather clause.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b574-8\">Woodburn\u2019s appealed the June 15, 2012 order of the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-9\">QUESTIONS PRESENTED</p>\n<p id=\"b574-10\">Woodburn\u2019s poses the following questions for our review:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b574-11\">1. Did the Calvert County Board of License Commissioners err in determining that the conversion of the original license owned by Woodburn\u2019s Beverage issued in 1945 to Class B, Beer and Wine in 2010 effectively terminated the original license and created a new license for Woodburn\u2019s Beverage?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b574-12\">2. Did the circuit court err in failing to address the finding that the Calvert County Liquor Board erred in its inter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>pretation of Annotated Code of Maryland Article 2(B) Section 9-102(a)(l)?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b575-4\">The Board and Patuxent have a different formulation of the issues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b575-5\">1. Was the Board of License Commissioners for Calvert County correct in denying the application for a Class A (off-sale) beer and wine license that the appellant Wood-burn\u2019s Beverages proposed to use in conjunction with and on the premises of a Food Lion supermarket, based on a finding that Food Lion is a \u201cchain store\u201d and \u201csupermarket\u201d of the type included within the prohibition set forth in section 9-102(a-l) of Article 2B, when the facts of record showed that the \u201cgrandfathering\u201d exception in section 9-102(a-l) was not applicable?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b575-6\">2. Was the Board of License Commissioners correct in concluding that even if the appellant could otherwise take advantage of the \u201cgrandfathering\u201d exception in section 9-102(a-l), the exception does not apply if there is a change in the classification of the alcoholic beverage license?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b575-7\">3. In affirming the Board\u2019s denial of the appellant\u2019s application, did the Circuit Court correctly conclude that the issue relating to a change in the classification of the alcoholic beverage license did not need to be considered, because, quite apart from that issue, the evidence before the Board showed that the prerequisite for avoiding the prohibitions in section 9-102(a-l) were not met?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b575-8\">For the following reasons, we side with the Board and uphold its decision to reject Woodburn\u2019s application to transfer its license to the Food Lion.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-9\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"Aih\">1. Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b575-10\">In liquor board cases, as in other judicial reviews of administrative agencies, we examine the decision of the board, not the circuit court. <em>Dakrish, LLC v. Raich, </em>209 Md.App. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>119, 141, 58 A.3d 482 (2012). Our role is limited to determining whether there was substantial evidence to support the agency\u2019s findings and to assessing whether the administrative decision was premised upon an erroneous conclusion of law. <em>Id. </em>at 141-42, 58 A.3d 482. We review the board\u2019s decision in the light most favorable to the agency since its actions are <em>prima facie </em>correct and presumptively valid. <em>Id. </em>at 142, 58 A.3d 482. However, questions of law, such as the interpretation of a statute, are reviewed <em>de novo. </em>Finally, the Court will review the Board\u2019s \u201cdecision solely on the grounds relied upon by the agency.\u201d <em>Department of Health &amp; Mental Hygiene v. Campbell, </em>364 Md. 108, 123, 771 A.2d 1051 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b576-4\">2. Basis for the Board\u2019s Decision</p>\n<p id=\"b576-5\">The parties disagree sharply over the grounds for the Board\u2019s decision. Woodburn\u2019s argues it was confined to the purely legal issue of whether the grandfather clause of \u00a7 9-102(a-l) of Article 2B is rendered inapplicable when a license classification has changed. The Board and Patuxent contend\u2014and the circuit court agreed\u2014that the Board also decided the partially factual issue of whether under \u00a7 9-102(a-l), Woodburn\u2019s sought to transfer the license to \u201ca similar type\u201d of business establishment, an issue contested before the Board. <em>See </em>pp. 549-50, 88 A.3d at 837-39, <em>supra. </em>The motion of Board member Swoap is murky on the point. The motion referenced \u00a7 9-102 and both issues are related, if not entwined. The evidence before the Board clearly invited comparison between Woodburn\u2019s and Food Lion. In our view, in light of the presumption of validity accorded the agency action, we believe it is the better course to read the Board\u2019s decision as embracing both of these issues. Thus, we will answer both questions.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-6\">3. The Demise of Woodburn\u2019s Food Market</p>\n<p id=\"b576-7\">Despite all the energy spent by the parties on the issue of whether and when Woodburn\u2019s was a supermarket, the record makes it abundantly clear that the licensee was not even a food market in June 2011 when it applied to transfer to the Food Lion\u2014which was unquestionably a supermarket/chain <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>store\u2014a license it had never previously held.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Woodburn\u2019s had lost its lease and ceased regular hours in April. It remained open only to liquidate its inventory. And at the present time, it is completely closed. It seems odd that \u00a7 9-102(a-l) would authorize such a transfer. Nevertheless it is Woodburn\u2019s contention that none of this matters. It presently holds one of the licenses enumerated in the statute and held one of those licenses when the grandfather provisions were added to the law in 1962 and 1978. Woodburn\u2019s argues that the grandfather clause in these enactments does not \u201crequire a supermarket to supermarket transfer (although that is what exists in this case).\u201d Regardless of the demise of Woodburn\u2019s Food Market, we will consider the legal correctness of these arguments.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b577-4\">4. The Parameters of \u00a7 9-102(a-l)</p>\n<p id=\"b577-5\">At the outset, we reject Woodburn\u2019s contention that the grandfathering authorized by \u00a7 9-102(a-l) applies to transfers from any business operating in 1962 or 1978, not just to those from a chain store/supermarket/discount house. The statute uses the term \u201cbusiness establishment\u201d three times. The first and third times,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> there is no doubt that the reference is to a chain store/supermarket or discount house. Woodburn\u2019s would ascribe a broader meaning to the law\u2019s second use of the same phrase. Textually, this makes no sense.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b578-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number>In our view, the first sentence of \u00a7 9-102(a-l) was \u201cintended to prohibit stores\u2014such as chain stores, supermarkets, or discount houses\u2014from obtaining liquor licenses.\u201d <em>Bd. of License Comm\u2019rs of Carroll Cnty. v. Pizza Hut of Md., Inc., </em>95 Md.App. 291, 802, 620 A.2d 953 (1993). The second sentence grandfathers the very same types of establishments that already held liquor licenses.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> And those licensees must have held their license on the effective date of the 1962/1978 legislation.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> In Part 6, <em>infra, </em>we will look at Woodburn\u2019s status on both dates.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>5. Impact of Changes in Class of License</p>\n<p id=\"b579-4\">Woodburn\u2019s argues that the changes in the class of its licenses over the years have no impact on its right under \u00a7 9-201(a-l) to transfer to the Food Lion the license it now holds. At the outset, there are problems with this proffered interpretation. The Attorney General has long advised that any application for renewal \u201ceither increasing or decreasing the class of beverage the licensee is authorized to sell must be treated as an original application.\u201d 43 <em>Opinions of the Attorney General </em>81, 82 (1958). An on-sale license where beer may be consumed with food is not the same as a beer and wine retailer. In short, categories of licenses are neither equivalent nor fungible.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-5\">In addition, absent from \u00a7 9-201(a-l) is language found in at least two other local chain store/supermarket laws that expressly authorize grandfathered licenses to change the class of their licenses. <em>See e.g., </em>Article 2B, \u00a7 9\u2014213(0(1) (\u201cThose establishments holding an alcoholic beverages license on July 1, 1976 may continue to hold that license, or apply to upgrade to Class A-l or A-2\u201d); \u00a7 9-217(h)(l) (\u201cHowever, those establishments holding an alcoholic beverage license at the time of the enactment of this section may continue to hold such license, and may, at the discretion of the Board of License Commissioners, change the classification of their license.\u201d). In <em>Food Lion, Inc. v. McCall, </em>122 Md.App. 429, 436, 712 A.2d 581 (1998), in contrasting the language in what is now \u00a7 9-201(a-l) with a local chain store/supermarket law, this Court applied the doctrine of negative implication often called <em>inclusio unius est exclusio alterius </em>(The inclusion of one is the exclusion of the other).</p>\n<p id=\"b579-6\">Woodburn\u2019s argues that its position is supported by this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Food Lion, Inc. v. McCall. </em>There, a supermarket holding a Class A (off-sale) beer and wine license and operating at several locations in Prince George\u2019s County <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number>since 1956 sought to transfer it to a Food Lion. 122 Md.App. at 432, 712 A.2d 581. We held that the transfer was governed by a local provision that precluded a transfer, rather than what is now \u00a7 9-102(a-l). <em>Id. </em>at 435-36, 712 A.2d 581. Woodburn\u2019s claims that this decision suggests that the transfer would otherwise have been permitted under the state-wide statute and that it is in an identical position to the licensee in <em>McCall. </em>However, there is no indication in <em>McCall </em>that the supermarket ever changed its license from Class A to another class\u2014an action, in any event, that would have been expressly permitted under the Prince George\u2019s chain store/supermarket law. <em>Id. </em>at 434, 712 A.2d 581.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-4\">Another major contention of Woodburn\u2019s is that if the Board is correct, it violated \u00a7 9-102(a-l) each time it authorized a change in the license for what Woodburn\u2019s asserts was a supermarket. However, there was no showing before the Board that the issue of compliance with the chain store/supermarket law ever arose on these prior occasions or that a post-1962 transfer to a chain store like Food Lion sparked the issue. More importantly, any long-standing administrative interpretation or practice or laxity in enforcement that is contrary to the clear and unambiguous language of a statute cannot be given effect. See <em>Salisbury Beauty Schools v. State Bd. of Cosmetologists, </em>268 Md. 32, 66-67, 300 A.2d 367 (1973); <em>see also Hecht v. Crook, </em>184 Md. 271, 283, 40 A.2d 673 (1945) (A State agency has no \u201cauthority to extend the benefits of [a statute] to persons ineligible thereto.\u201d). For these reasons, we believe the better interpretation of \u00a7 9-102(a-l) is that a change in the class of license by a business grandfathered in 1962/1978 removes the licensee from the exemption and subjects the business to the chain store/supermarket prohibition. Therefore, the Board did not err in denying Woodburn\u2019s transfer request on this basis.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b581-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"559\">*559</page-number>6. Transfer to a Similar Type of Business Establishment</p>\n<p id=\"b581-4\">Even were we wrong about the application of \u00a7 9-102(a-l) to business establishments that change their license classification, we would be obliged to uphold the Board and affirm the circuit court on the alternative ground that the proposed transfer would not have been made to a \u201csimilar type of business establishment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b581-5\">We have already rejected Woodburn\u2019s contention that the focus of the transfer provision is the near-present, when Woodburn\u2019s was operating at its highest and best use and we are not addressing the immediate present, when it is not operating at all. Aiming our sights at 1962, we note that Woodburn\u2019s was a small food store or food market with 6000 square feet and a beer license. Although evidence is lacking as to the precise size in 1978, at the time of its relocation in 1988, its size was still under 10,000 square feet. Thus, it is clear that in 1978, the size of the premises was still 6000-10,000 square feet. It still held only a beer license. Thus, the only evidence in the record is that Woodburn\u2019s was a small but growing food store or food market at the time of any grandfathering. But even if we move back to the future to 2010, when the business\u2014still just one store\u2014had grown to 16,000 square feet, Woodburn\u2019s was not comparable to the Food Lion in Lusby, which was 39,000 square feet and undoubtedly a chain store with 1300 stores. Without focusing on all conceivable points of comparison between the two businesses, or even the troubling facts about the proposed absorption of Wood-burn\u2019s alcoholic beverage business into Food Lion\u2019s operation, we believe the above facts show that there was substantial evidence to support the Board\u2019s implicit finding that the transfer was not consistent with \u00a7 9-102(a-l). In short, the Food Lion was not a similar type of business establishment to Woodburn\u2019s, whether in 1962, 1978 or 2010.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-6\">JUDGMENT AFFIRMED. COSTS TO BE PAID BY APPELLANT.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b567-13\">. Comments of Arthur Koch prepared for Senate Economic Affairs Committee on Senate Bill 970, dated March 16, 1978.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b568-6\"><em>. </em>For the ease of the reader, we will refer to this statute as the \"chain store/supermarket law.\u201d It is codified at Md.Code (1957, 2011 Repl. Vol.), Article 2B, \u00a7 9-102(a-l), which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b568-7\">A Class A, B, or D beer license, beer and wine license, or beer, wine and liquor license, except by way of renewal, may not be granted, transferred, or issued to, or for use in conjunction with, or upon the premises of any business establishment of the type commonly known as chain stores, supermarkets, or discount houses. This subsection does not apply to or affect any business establishment already holding such a license or the possibility of such licensee having the license transferred to a similar type of business establishment. Discount houses do not include licensees who sell at discount prices.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b568-8\">This law was originally enacted in 1962 and at that time, applied only to Class A, B or D beer, wine and liquor licenses. Chapter 99, <em>Laws of 1962. </em>The 1978 legislation applied the prohibition specifically to beer licenses, beer and wine licenses, and beer, wine and liquor licenses of the enumerated classes. There are also local provisions in Article 2B restricting the licensing of chain stores and supermarkets. <em>See, e.g., </em>Article 2B, \u00a7 9-213(f)(l).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b568-9\">. Another party to this appeal is appellee Patuxent Wine &amp; Spirits, Inc. (\"Patuxent\u201d), which opposed the transfer of the license before the Board.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b569-8\">. Generally, under Article 2B, a B license is used by hotels or restaurants for sales of beer on the premises or elsewhere, while a Class A license is for sales of beverages for consumption off the premises only.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b569-9\">. It is not clear whether Woodburn's ever operated in Lusby and if it did, when it moved to Solomons Island. The Board has included in an appendix to its brief, a 1973 application of Woodburn\u2019s for a Class A beer license. The application describes the premises in Solomons Island as 60 X 100 feet. We take judicial notice of this public record that provides necessary background and reject Woodburn\u2019s motion to strike the document.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b569-10\">. In an appendix to the Board\u2019s brief is a 1995 application by Wood-burn\u2019s for a Class A beer and wine license. There is no indication what happened to this application, but obviously it was never granted. This application plays no role in our analysis.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b570-9\">. McKay testified that although Woodburn\u2019s Food Market had ceased regular hours in April and had lost its lease, it remained open on weekends to liquidate its inventory, including alcoholic beverages. At the present time, the premises are closed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b577-6\">. Although Woodburn's was licensed to sell beer off-sale and wine on-sale, it had never obtained the more coveted privilege of selling both beer and wine for consumption off the premises.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b577-7\">. The Board also did not premise its decision on the closing of Wood-burn\u2019s Food Market.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b577-8\">. Woodburn's argues that the third reference to <em>\"a </em>similar type of business establishment\u201d expands the exemption to businesses that are not the three types enumerated in the statute. This seems like a quite implausible reading of the intent of this largely prohibitive legislation. The word \"similar\u201d was probably used rather than \"identical\u201d because the provision covers three types of businesses.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b577-9\">. The title to Chapter 991 of the <em>Laws of 1978 </em>uses the term \"business establishment\u201d just once and only in language tied to the premises of the three enumerated business entities.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b578-4\">. In the First Reader version of SB 970, the phrase, \"business establishment\u201d was modified by the terms \"OF THE TYPE COMMONLY KNOWN AS CHAIN STORES, SUPERMARKETS, OR DISCOUNT HOUSES.\u201d The capitalized language was deleted by amendment. While this omission might theoretically support Woodburn\u2019s position, the title of the bill does not reflect any substantive change as to the type of establishments affected by the legislation. <em>See Barrett v. Clark, </em>189 Md. 116, 127, 54 A.2d 128 (1947) (A statute can be given no more extended operation than that explained in the title). The only part of the title that could encompass this language change is \"clarifying language.\u201d This is a weak reed to support Woodburn\u2019s reading of \u00a7 9-102.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b578-5\">. An intriguing question is which, if any, of these two grandfathering dates applies to Woodburn\u2019s. The 1962 legislation applied to the enumerated establishments with a \"Class A, B or D beer, wine <em>and </em>liquor license.\u201d (Emphasis added). Chapter 99, <em>Laws of 1962. </em>If this provision affected only those establishments entitled to sell all three types of alcoholic beverages, it would not have applied to Woodburn\u2019s, which in 1962 had just a beer license. The 1978 amendments to the chain store/supermarket law essentially changed the \"and\u201d to an \"and/ or\u201d to make it clear that the statutory prohibition applied to each type of alcoholic beverage sold. A Fiscal Note to the legislation (SB 970) dated March 17, 1978 stated that the bill \u201cclarifies\" certain provisions. A note handwritten by an unknown person on the First Reader version of the Senate Bill (contained in the legislation file) said that the pre1978 law was \"[ojriginally thought to include every one.\u201d The remainder of the committee file is not instructive. The Senate Economic Affairs Committee, then-chaired by Senate Harry J. McGuirk, considered the 1978 legislation. It was probably the only legislative committee at the time to take detailed notes about what transpired in committee. Unfortunately, they are written in a shorthand that is virtually indecipherable. <em>See </em>Jack Schwartz and Amanda Stakem Conn, <em>The </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number><em>Court of Appeals at the Cocktail Party: The Use and Misuse of Legislative History, </em>54 Md. L.Rev. 432, 446 n. 59 (1995).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b580-5\">. Because we conclude that the Board was correct in its application of \u00a7 9-101(a-l), we need not address Woodburn's contention that the circuit court erred in not reaching the issue.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
