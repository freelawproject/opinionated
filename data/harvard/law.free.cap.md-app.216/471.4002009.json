Black (collectively, \u201cBlackstone\u201d). The complaint asked the circuit court to declare that the parties\u2019 insurance policy did not cover a lawsuit brought against Blackstone by RMG Direct, Inc. (\u201cRMG\u201d), and that the Insurers had no duty to defend Blackstone in that suit. Blackstone counter-claimed for opposite declarations and asked the court to order the Insurers to pay the costs of litigation in the RMG case and in the present case, as well as to indemnify Blackstone for any damages arising from that case.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-8\">Blackstone moved for partial summary judgment on the duty to defend in the underlying litigation, and the Insurers moved for summary judgment as to both their duty to defend and their duty to indemnify. The circuit court granted the Insurers\u2019 motion and entered summary judgment in their favor, from which Blackstone timely appealed, bringing the case before this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-9\">Question Presented</p>\n<p id=\"b498-10\">Blackstone presents the following question for our review, which we have rephrased to comport with our discussion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b498-11\">I. Did the trial court err when it entered summary judgment in favor of the Insurers on the grounds that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>underlying claims against Blackstone did not constitute \u201cadvertising injuries\u201d under the parties\u2019 insurance agreement?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b499-5\">For the reasons that follow, we answer yes, and we therefore reverse the judgment of the Circuit Court for Baltimore County and remand the case for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-6\">Factual and Procedural History</p>\n<p id=\"b499-7\">Blackstone designs and manufactures lighting products, including those that mimic natural light, which are known as \u201cfull spectrum\u201d lights. In February 2010, Blackstone was sued by RMG, whose complaint claimed, in part, that the two parties had agreed to a \u201cjoint venture to develop plans for the design, marketing and sale of low vision lighting products to retailers.\u201d RMG further alleged that Blackstone had promised to give RMG seven percent of its gross revenues from the sale of these products, and that RMG was to have a \u201cfifty-percent [ ] interest in the newly created brand for the sale of low vision light products.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b499-8\">RMG claimed that its efforts in the joint venture yielded expert evaluations and product testimonials, the \u201cVision Enhance\u201d brand name, the slogan <em>\u201cto help you see better\u201d </em>and the product\u2019s packaging design and \u201ccopy\u201d (the content displayed on the packaging). According to the complaint, Blackstone used and distributed this content in various forms, including its product packaging, a website, a trade publication advertisement, and third-party catalogs, as well as in sales sheets, informational offerings, and marketing presentations to retailers such as Wal-Mart. According to RMG, sales were so successful that Wal-Mart adopted the product into its own private-label line of products.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-9\">RMG asserted several causes of action in its complaint against Blackstone. First, RMG claimed that Blackstone breached an oral contract<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> between the parties by failing to pay RMG either its commission or profits from its one-half interest in the parties\u2019 new venture. Second, RMG claimed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>that its detrimental reliance on Blackstone\u2019s promises es-topped Blackstone from withholding those payments. Third, RMG claimed that Blackstone was unjustly enriched because it \u201ccontinues to retain the benefit conferred upon it by Plaintiff through, in part, its use of concepts, expert evaluations, [the] \u201cVision Enhance\u2019 brand name[,] and packaging, all of which were developed by [RMG] or with [RMG]\u2019s assistance.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Fourth, RMG claimed intentional misrepresentation of the promises supporting the above claims. Finally, RMG demanded an accounting of Blackstone\u2019s profits.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-5\">Blackstone has been insured by the Insurers for commercial general liability since 2001. The parties\u2019 agreement places upon the Insurers the duty to defend Blackstone against any suit seeking damages from an \u201cadvertising injury,\u201d which the policy defines as injuries arising out of the use of another\u2019s advertising idea in Blackstone\u2019s advertisement, or out of infringement upon another\u2019s copyright, trade dress, or slogan.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The policy\u2019s text excluded, however, injuries arising out of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>breach of contract, except an implied contract to use another\u2019s advertising idea in Blackstone\u2019s advertisement.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b501-5\">Blackstone gave the Insurers notice of RMG\u2019s suit in a timely fashion, but the Insurers denied that RMG\u2019s claims fell within the scope of the policy\u2019s \u201cadvertising injury\u201d clause. Blackstone eventually settled with RMG, but only after incurring an alleged $1,056,008.63 in attorney\u2019s fees, which the Insurers refused to pay. The Insurers brought a complaint in the Circuit Court for Baltimore County, seeking a declaratory judgment that they had no duty to defend or indemnify Blackstone. Blackstone counterclaimed for the opposite declaration and attorney\u2019s fees in both the underlying litigation and the instant suit. Blackstone moved for partial summary judgment on the issue of the Insurers\u2019 duty to defend, and the Insurers moved for summary judgment on both their duty to defend and to indemnify Blackstone. The circuit court found for the Insurers and entered summary judgment in their favor.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Blackstone then filed a timely appeal, bringing the case before this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"AR2d\">Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b502-4\">This case comes to us on disposition by summary judgment under Maryland Rule 5\u2014201(f). We therefore review the trial court\u2019s ruling <em>de novo </em>and examine the record independently to determine whether there exists any genuine issue of material fact and whether the moving party was entitled to judgment as a matter of law. <em>Walk v. Hartford Cas. Ins. Co., </em>382 Md. 1, 14, 852 A.2d 98 (2004) (citation omitted). In doing so, we must review the record in the light most favorable to the non-moving party and construe against the moving party any reasonable inferences which may be drawn from the facts. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b502-5\">Because a policy of insurance is a contract, we construe it according to contract principles. <em>Walk, </em>382 Md. at 14-15, 852 A.2d 98 (citation omitted). Unless there is an indication that the parties intended to use words in the policy in a technical sense, the terms of the contract are accorded their customary, ordinary, and accepted meanings. <em>Id. </em>If the terms are unambiguous, a court has no alternative but to enforce them. <em>Dutta v. State Farm Ins. Co., </em>363 Md. 540, 556-57, 769 A.2d 948 (2001) (citing <em>Kendall v. Nationwide Ins. Co., </em>348 Md. 157, 171, 702 A.2d 767 (1997)). Maryland does not follow the rule that insurance policies should, as a matter of course, be construed against the insurer. <em>Dutta, </em>363 Md. at 556, 769 A.2d 948. \u201cNevertheless, under general principles of contract construction, if an insurance policy is ambiguous, it will be construed liberally in favor of the insured and against the insurer <em>as drafter of the instrument.\u201d Id. </em>at 556-57, 769 A.2d 948 (citing <em>Empire Fire &amp; Marine Ins. Co. v. Liberty Mut. Ins. Co., </em>117 Md.App. 72, 97-98, 699 A.2d 482 (1997)) (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b502-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-7\">The Insurers\u2019 duty to defend Blackstone in the underlying litigation depended on the character of RMG\u2019s claims:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b503-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>If the plaintiffs in the [ ] suits allege a claim covered by the policy, the insurer has a duty to defend. Even if a [] plaintiff does not allege facts which clearly bring the claim within or without the policy coverage, the insurer still must defend if there is a <em>potentiality </em>that the claim could be covered by the policy.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b503-5\"><em>Brohawn v. Transamerica Ins. Co., </em>276 Md. 396, 407-08, 347 A.2d 842 (1975) (emphasis added), <em>cited in Aetna Cas. &amp; Sur. Co. v. Cochran, </em>337 Md. 98, 102-03, 651 A.2d 859 (1995). Further, an insurer is obligated to defend <em>all </em>claims, notwithstanding alternative allegations outside the policy\u2019s coverage, until all potentially covered claims are resolved. <em>Utica Mut. Ins. Co. v. Miller, </em>130 Md.App. 373, 383, 746 A.2d 935 (2000) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b503-6\">The parties stipulate that Blackstone had performed all prerequisites to coverage, and that the case resolves to whether RMG\u2019s complaint triggered the Insurers\u2019 contractual duty to defend. In the present case, all claims remained viable until Blackstone and RMG reached a settlement. Therefore, Blackstone is entitled to have the Insurers reimburse all of its defense costs if they had a duty to defend <em>at least one </em>count of RMG\u2019s complaint. The Insurers argue that they had no duty to defend because the RMG complaint alleged neither the use of RMG\u2019s advertising ideas in Blackstone\u2019s advertisement, nor a qualifying \u201cadvertising injury.\u201d We address each contention, in turn.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b503-7\">A. Use of RMG\u2019s Advertising Ideas in Blackstone\u2019s Advertisements</p>\n<p id=\"b503-8\">The Insurers argue that the trial court rightly denied Blackstone\u2019s motion for summary judgment because RMG\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>claims nowhere described use of its advertising ideas in Blackstone\u2019s \u201cadvertisements.\u201d The parties\u2019 agreement defines \u201cadvertisements\u201d as \u201ca notice that is broadcast or published to the general public or specific market segments about [Blackstone\u2019s] goods, products or services for the purpose of attracting customers or supporters ... including] material placed on the Internet or on similar electronic means of communication[.]\u201d According to Blackstone, RMG complained of injuries from several types of advertising: 1) a product website; 2) product packaging and instructions; 3) advertisement in a trade publication and third-party catalogs; and 4) sales sheets, informational offerings, and marketing presentations to large retailers, including Wal-Mart.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-4\">First, the Insurers argue that the evidence of a Blackstone website using RMG\u2019s advertising \u201cis contested,\u201d and that testimony from the RMG suit \u201ccasts doubt on whether this image was ever used to solicit customers.\u201d But \u201can insurer may not use extrinsic evidence to contest coverage under an insurance policy if the tort suit complaint establishes a potentiality of coverage,\u201d <em>Aetna Cas. &amp; Sur. Co. v. Cochran, </em>337 Md. 98, 107, 651 A.2d 859 (1995), and an allegation that is \u201ccontested\u201d or in \u201cdoubt\u201d is nonetheless sufficient to show its <em>potential </em>truth, <em>see 7416 Baltimore Ave. Corp. v. Penn-Am. Ins. Co., </em>83 Md.App. 692, 699-700, 577 A.2d 398 (1990). Therefore, the factual allegations in RMG\u2019s complaint sufficed to show that the website was a <em>potential </em>advertisement that triggered the Insurers\u2019 duty to defend.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-5\">Second, the Insurers cite several cases to argue that Blackstone\u2019s product packaging is not an \u201cadvertisement.\u201d These cases, however, hold that a <em>product itself </em>is not advertising. <em>See, e.g., Krueger Int'l, Inc. v. Fed. Ins. Co., </em>647 F.Supp.2d 1024, 1035 (E.D.Wis.2009) (citing <em>Westport Reinsurance Management, LLC v. St. Paul Fire &amp; Marine Ins. Co., </em>80 Fed.Appx. 277, 279 (3d Cir.2003); <em>Green Mach. Corp. v. Zurich-American Ins. Group, </em>313 F.3d 837, 841 (3d Cir.2002); <em>Accessories Biz, Inc. v. Linda and Jay Keane, Inc., </em>533 F.Supp.2d 381, 388 (S.D.N.Y.2008); <em>Hosel &amp; Anderson, Inc. v. ZV II, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number><em>Inc., </em>2001 WL 392229, *2 (S.D.N.Y.2001)). But these cases are inapposite because RMG\u2019s allegations did not depend on the product <em>itself </em>being advertising, but rather the ideas <em>shown on the packaging </em>in which Blackstone\u2019s products was shipped and displayed.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-5\">The Insurers contend that even if Blackstone\u2019s product packaging <em>was </em>designed to \u201cattract customers or supporters,\u201d it did so on an individual basis as a \u201csolicitation,\u201d rather than as \u201ca notice that is broadcast or published to the general public or specific market segments\u201d (per the insurance agreement\u2019s definition of \u201cadvertisement\u201d). This argument, however, overemphasizes the customer\u2019s immediate perception and ignores the fact that Blackstone <em>distributed </em>advertising ideas on standardized packaging, with the evident intent to reach and attract a wide audience of shoppers at the product\u2019s point of sale. This brings Blackstone\u2019s alleged conduct within at least one of the ordinary meanings ascribed to \u201cpublish,\u201d <em>i.e., </em>\u201cto disseminate to the public\u201d or \u201cto produce or release for distribution.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> \u201cPublish,\u201d <em>Merriam-Webster.com </em>(Merriam-Webster 2014), http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/ publish. Moreover, the Insurers\u2019 definition of \u201cadvertisement\u201d would turn any content viewed by isolated customers into an individual solicitation, which would create the absurd result of turning a wide array of advertisements\u2014on television, in magazines, and on the internet\u2014into \u201cpersonal solicitations.\u201d We therefore conclude that Blackstone\u2019s product packaging could be an \u201cadvertisement\u201d under the present insurance agreement.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b506-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>Third, the Insurers argue that \u201can advertisement procured by RMG\u201d and \u201ccatalog placement by RMG\u201d cannot be \u201cBlackstone\u2019s\u201d advertisements. And fourth, the Insurers argue that the marketing presentations Blackstone made to Wal-Mart and other large retailers were not advertisements and that they were also merely individual solicitations. We need not, however, decide these issues, because the alleged website and packaging constituted advertisements that were\u2014at least potentially\u2014\u201cBlackstone\u2019s.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b506-5\">Finally, the Insurers argue that even if Blackstone used advertising ideas in its \u201cadvertisements,\u201d those <em>ideas </em>were Blackstone\u2019s and not <em>\u201canother\u2019s\u201d </em>under the insurance policy. Specifically, the Insurers argue that Blackstone owned all disputed advertising ideas<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> by virtue of its joint venture with RMG. But this joint venture, along with the agreement purporting to assign Blackstone all property rights,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> was only <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number><em>alleged, </em>in some of the complaint\u2019s counts, and RMG\u2019s claim of unjust enrichment did <em>not </em>rely on a binding joint venture agreement, or on any joint venture at all. Furthermore, a plain reading of the contractual language does not support the Insurers\u2019 argument over \u201cownership\u201d because the possessive case can indicate not only <em>ownership, </em>but also <em>origin. </em>\u201cPossessive,\u201d <em>Dictionary.com Unabridged </em>(Random House, Inc. 2013) (\u201cindicating possession, ownership, <em>origin, </em>etc.\u201d (emphasis added)), http://dictionary.reference.com/ browse/Possessive. Thus, even if Blackstone owned some or all rights to the disputed advertising ideas, those ideas could nevertheless be described as \u201canother\u2019s\u201d because of their origin at RMG.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-4\">For these reasons, we conclude that RMG\u2019s complaint alleged that Blackstone used RMG\u2019s advertising ideas in its advertisements. This leaves us to consider whether Blackstone\u2019s advertisements gave rise to any covered \u201cadvertising injury.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b507-5\">B. \u201cAdvertising Injury\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b507-6\">The Insurers argue that RMG\u2019s claims did not allege any \u201cadvertising injury\u201d to defend against. Specifically, they contend that \u201cthe principle [sic] purpose of a liability policy [is] to protect insureds from their own <em>tortious, negligent conduct </em>\u201d (emphasis added) and not the harms alleged in RMG\u2019s complaint. Continuing, the Insurers contend that \u201cthe gravamen\u201d of RMG\u2019s complaint \u201cis not damages caused by Blackstone\u2019s advertisements but rather damages caused by Blackstone\u2019s failure to abide by an agreement to pay RMG commissions,\u201d and that the complaint is \u201creplete\u201d with references to that agreement for commissions. Thus, the Insurers conclude that \u201cBlackstone would have the Court transform Policy coverage from a protection against tortious, negligent conduct into a protection against failures to comply with contractual agreements for the payment of commissions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b508-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>There are two flaws in the Insurers\u2019 general argument. First, the policy\u2019s duty to defend is not determined by the \u201cgravamen of the complaint;\u201d rather, Maryland Law imposes a duty to defend if there exists even a <em>single claim </em>that could <em>potentially </em>be covered, <em>Utica Mut., </em>130 Md.App. at 383, 746 A.2d 935. And although we may look to the \u201cgravamen\u201d of particular causes of action to determine whether they could be construed in favor of the insured as covered claims, we must nonetheless consider each one individually, according to the insurance policy\u2019s language. <em>Montgomery Cnty. Bd. of Educ. v. Horace Mann Ins. Co., </em>383 Md. 527, 547-48, 860 A.2d 909 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b508-4\">Second, although we have every reason to believe the Insurers\u2019 proffer that they intended their policy to cover only Blackstone\u2019s \u201ctortious, negligent conduct,\u201d the policy does not do so by defining \u201cadvertising injury\u201d that way. The policy contains <em>express exclusions </em>that have that effect,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> but the Insurers <em>deliberately waived them </em>at trial, writing in a proposed statement of undisputed fact that their defense does \u201cnot rel[y] on the breach of contract exclusion,\u201d which they deemed \u201cirrelevant\u201d to the instant case. Later, at the hearing on the parties\u2019 cross-motions for summary judgment, the Insurers addressed the policy\u2019s exclusions in greater detail:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b508-5\">... [I]t\u2019s clear on the face of the second amended complaint that the allegations don\u2019t come within the policy coverages. But even if Blackstone could get over that hurdle, then we do look down to the exceptions, I\u2019m sorry, the exclusions. And there are two relevant exclusions in this case. The first is that the policy does not provide coverage for advertising injury caused at or direction, at or, by or at the direction of the insured with the knowledge that the act would violate the rights of another and would inflict personal or advertising injury. So if we assume here that [RMG] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>didn\u2019t transfer the rights, then what we get to is did [RMG] say regardless of who owned the rights I\u2019m going to use them? And the exclusion would become applicable. Secondly, and although Maryland Casualty didn\u2019t put this in the litigation and, and there\u2019s a very clear reason why Maryland Casualty didn\u2019t put it in the litigation at this point. There\u2019s a contract exclusion. Again, with respect to the shifting of burdens of proof, we think that Your Honor can rule as a matter of law on the insured\u2019s burden and its failure to meet the burden to show that the coverage comes within the insuring agreement. <em>If we go down to the exclusion, it becomes my burden. It makes it harder to deal with on summary judgment but and so we decided not to include it. </em>But there\u2019s a, a, an exclusion that says for advertising injury arising out of breach of contract except an implied contract to use another\u2019s idea in your advertising. So breach of contract, if it\u2019s a breach of contract it\u2019s out the door.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AfWJ\">(Emphases added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b509-4\">If we give the Insurers the benefit of the doubt, their statements that they \u201cdidn\u2019t put <em>this </em>in the litigation\u201d and \u201cdecided not to include <em>it </em>\u201d refer only to the contract exclusion and not to the exclusion for knowing conduct. But regardless of whether their intention reached only one and not the other exclusion, the Insurers omitted <em>both </em>from their memorandum opposing summary judgment, and they have not addressed or otherwise incorporated either one in their appellate arguments. Instead, the Insurers urged the trial court not to \u201cget bogged down\u201d in the contractual language and to construe the agreement in their favor because \u201c[t]he <em>intent of a general liability policy </em>is to provide coverage, and perhaps indemnity in certain cases, for alleged unintentional tortious actions\u201d (emphasis added).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b510-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>The Insurers may have seen the details of their contract\u2019s language as a \u201cbog\u201d impeding their case, but from our vantage point, words are the very foundation of contracts and the law. Language is a tool that can be used\u2014even if only imperfectly\u2014to memorialize an agreement between two parties, helping them plan their future conduct and resolve disputes, should they arise. And although our goal in construing a contract is \u201cto ascertain and effectuate the intent of the parties to the agreement,\u201d <em>Empire Fire &amp; Marine Ins. Co. v. Liberty Mut. Ins. Co., </em>117 Md.App. 72, 96, 699 A.2d 482 (1997), we cannot, in fairness to Blackstone, allow the Insurers to revive an argument that they waived at trial by relying on the policy\u2019s exclusions.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-5\">Having limited the present dispute to the plain meaning of \u201cadvertising injury\u201d in the parties\u2019 agreement, the exclusions belie the Insurers\u2019 contentions. They argue that wherever an insurance agreement defines \u201cadvertising injury\u201d as \u201cany injury arising out of the use of another\u2019s advertising idea in your advertisement,\u201d this definition excludes\u2014by default\u2014all injuries arising from intentional conduct or breach of contract. But the Insurers carved exactly those kinds of injuries out of \u201cadvertising injury\u201d by drafting express exclusions to that term\u2019s definition. This implies that, had intentional conduct and breaches of contract <em>not </em>been excluded, they would fall <em>within </em>the agreement\u2019s broad and unambiguous definition of \u201cadvertising injury.\u201d <footnotemark>14</footnotemark> And this broad and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>unambiguous definition is all that is left for the Insurers to use in their defense, having expressly stated to the trial court that they would not rely on those exclusions to argue against their duty to defend Blackstone. Thus, as presented to us, the Insurers\u2019 duty to defend Blackstone depends only on whether RMG\u2019s claims \u201carose out of\u2019 the use of RMG\u2019s advertising ideas in Blackstone\u2019s advertisements, without regard to whether the acts were intentional or rooted in breach of contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-4\">In Maryland, the phrase \u201carising out of\u2019 in an insurance contract triggers a causation analysis requiring a \u201cdirect or substantial\u201d relationship between cause and effect. <em>See State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. v. DeHaan, </em>393 Md. 163, 178-79, 900 A.2d 208 (2006); <em>Nat\u2019l Indem. Co. v. Ewing, </em>235 Md. 145, 149, 200 A.2d 680 (1964) (\u201c[W]hile the words [\u201carising out of\u201d] import and require a showing of causal relationship, recovery is not limited by the strict rales developed in relation to direct and proximate cause.\u201d). Turning to RMG\u2019s complaint, we see that its claims for breach of contract, promissory estoppel, and intentional misrepresentation do not meet this definition because they all allege that Blackstone was indebted to RMG by virtue of the <em>work </em>that RMG performed to <em>develop </em>advertising content. As such, the claims remained viable even if Blackstone had never used the disputed advertising ideas to sell its products. These claims did not, therefore, depend on Blackstone\u2019s alleged \u201cuse\u201d of RMG\u2019s advertising ideas, and so they did not \u201carise out of\u2019 the same.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-5\">RMG\u2019s remaining unjust enrichment claim <em>did, </em>however, depend on Blackstone\u2019s use of RMG\u2019s advertising ideas. In that count, RMG alleged that Blackstone was unjustly enriched by retaining the benefit flowing from its use of RMG\u2019s ideas in advertisements for Blackstone\u2019s products. The com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>plaint\u2019s count for unjust enrichment therefore bore a \u201cdirect and substantial\u201d relationship to the use of RMG\u2019s advertising ideas in Blackstone\u2019s advertisements, <em>see DeHaan, </em>393 Md. at 178-79, 900 A.2d 208, making that claim an \u201cadvertising injury\u201d under the parties\u2019 insurance agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-5\">Having waived at trial the policy\u2019s exclusions, the general definition of \u201cadvertising injury\u201d bound the Insurers to defend Blackstone against RMG\u2019s unjust enrichment claim, even if their intent was to exclude that cause of action as an \u201cintentional\u201d act or breach of contract.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> And because that covered claim survived throughout the proceedings in RMG\u2019s suit against Blackstone, Maryland law obligated the Insurers to defend Blackstone against all of RMG\u2019s concurrent claims.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> <em>See Utica Mut., </em>130 Md.App. at 383, 746 A.2d 935. The trial court therefore erred when it denied Blackstone\u2019s motion for summary judgment declaring that the Insurers had a duty to defend in the underlying litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-6\">C. Damages</p>\n<p id=\"b512-7\">With the Insurers\u2019 duty to defend decided in its favor, Blackstone argues that we should instruct the trial court, upon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>remand, to award the total amount of damages demanded in its counterclaim. According to Blackstone, these damages flow automatically from liability because \u201cthe Insurers cannot point to a single piece of evidence creating a factual dispute ... as to the reasonableness of Blackstone\u2019s defense costs.\u201d In response, the Insurers argue that the fee invoices Blackstone submitted at trial \u201cpresent a myriad of issues including, but not limited to: duplication of effort, billing inefficiencies, overstaffing of assignments, unreasonable hourly rates, extraneous work efforts, etc.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b513-4\">Blackstone is correct that the Insurers have neither identified any specific charges that they considered unreasonable, nor explained why those charges are unreasonable. <em>See Appiah v. Hall, </em>416 Md. 533, 546-47, 7 A.3d 536 (2010) (to avoid summary judgment, the nonmoving party must present detailed and precise facts showing a material dispute). The Insurers did, however, argue that they were only obligated to reimburse Blackstone for \u201creasonable\u201d fees, and that Blackstone had presented no evidence or testimony, expert or otherwise, showing that the fees were \u201creasonable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b513-5\">When faced with an award of attorney\u2019s fees in a case such as this, the insurer is \u201centitled to have the amount of fees and expenses proven with the certainty and under the standards ordinarily applicable for proof of contractual damages.\u201d <em>Commercial Union Ins. Co. v. Porter Hayden Co., </em>116 Md. App. 605, 703, 698 A.2d 1167 (1997) (citations omitted). The Insurers\u2019 opposition to summary judgment for Blackstone raised a dispute of material fact that Blackstone did not extinguish at trial, <em>i.e., </em>the reasonableness of Blackstone\u2019s fees spent defending itself in the underlying litigation with RMG.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-6\">Upon remand, Blackstone must prove its reasonable fees from the underlying RMG litigation and the instant suit,<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>well as its entitlement to indemnification.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> <em>See Constitution Associates v. New Hampshire Ins. Co., </em>930 P.2d 556, 563 (Colo.1996) (\u201cWhere there is no duty to defend, it follows that there can be no duty to indemnify. However, where there is a duty to defend, there is not necessarily a duty to indemnify.\u201d). Additionally, \u201cthe court must enter a declaratory judgment and that judgment, defining the rights and obligations of the parties or the status of the thing in controversy, <em>must be in uniting.\u201d Allstate Ins.

The Insurers divide their argument into three elements drawn from <em>Walk, </em>382 Md. at 17, 852 A.2d 98, namely: \"(1) an advertisement\u2019; (2) an 'advertising injury,\u2019 which entails the copying of an advertising idea or style into an advertisement; and (3) a causal relationship between the advertising injury and the alleged damages.\u201d That delineation, however, is not suited to the present discussion. As our opinion makes clear, below, \"causation\u201d in this case is subsumed within the contractual definition of \u201cadvertising injury,\u201d leaving only the first two issues.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b505-6\">. Blackstone's actions also fall within the gambit of \"broadcast,\u201d as something \"made widely known.\u201d \"Broadcast,\u201d <em>Merriam-Webster.com </em>(Merriam-Webster 2014), http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/ broadcast.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b505-7\">. The same could not be said of the product instructions. Instructions have been considered advertisements where they contain information about technical specifications, product advantages, compatibility, and installation and warranty information. <em>Teletronics Int\u2019l, Inc. v. CNA Ins. Co./Transp. Ins. Co., </em>120 Fed.Appx. 440, 445 (4th Cir.2005). But in the <em>Teletronics </em>case, that information was disseminated over the inter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>net to <em>potential </em>customers, <em>id., </em>whereas there is no indication in RMG\u2019s complaint that consumers could have seen any instructions until <em>after </em>purchasing Blackstone\u2019s product. Thus, the instructions could not have \"attracted\u201d customers, per the policy\u2019s definition of \"advertisement.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b506-7\">. If we were to consider Blackstone\u2019s argument about the advertisements procured by RMG, our decision would not fall in the Insurers\u2019 favor. They fail to explain why those advertisements should not be attributed to Blackstone in this case. The complaint plainly implies that RMG was acting as Blackstone\u2019s agent\u2014or at least in reliance on Blackstone\u2019s promises\u2014when it placed the advertisements, whether or not there was a formal joint venture between them. As such, there was at least a potentiality that the phrase \"your advertisements\u201d in the insurance policy described those that RMG allegedly placed on behalf of Blackstone.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-8\">That would leave the Insurers\u2019 argument that marketing presentations to large retailers are not advertisements but are individual solicitations. We would not reject this argument out of hand, but neither would we foreclose the opposite conclusion, which is that Blackstone presented standardized materials to a large enough number of retailers to constitute a \"specific market segment.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b506-9\">. Other than its attack on the product packaging, the Insurers do not appear to dispute that the content displayed and otherwise incorporated in these advertisements\u2014the brand name, slogan, testimonials, design, and copy\u2014constituted \"advertising ideas.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b506-10\">. According to the complaint, RMG and Blackstone agreed to terms reflected in a written contract that was never signed, but which provid<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>ed that \"Blackstone will be the owner of all assets and property rights related to the Vision Enhance Division including, but not limited to, domain names, intellectual property rights, and goodwill....\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b508-6\">. These exclusions described injuries \"[cjaused by or at the direction of the insured with the knowledge that the act would violate the rights of another and would inflict \u2018personal and advertising injury,' \" and injuries \"[a]rising out of a breach of contract, except an implied contract to use another\u2019s advertising idea in your \u2018advertisement.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b509-5\">. The Insurers explained in the above passage that they decided not to argue the policy exclusions because of the burden it would place on them. But we are not sure of what burden they meant. Ordinarily, an insurer denying coverage based on a policy exclusion bears the burden of proof. <em>See Mut. Fire Ins. Co. of Calvert Cnty. v. Ackerman, </em>162 Md.App. 1, 7-8, 872 A.2d 110 (2005). The present dispute, however, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>reached only the Insurers\u2019 <em>duty to defend </em>and did not require proof of a <em>factual </em>circumstance tantamount to an affirmative defense. <em>See id. </em>(circuit court correctly placed factual burden on insurer because proving that an exclusion applied \"was in the nature of an affirmative defense\u201d) (citing 14, 17 Lee R. Russ <em>et al., Couch on Ins. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 81.81, 94.108, 254:86 (3d ed. 2012)). While Blackstone\u2019s arguments on the duty to defend did in some sense burden the Insurers, they did so only as a matter of legal argument, not proof by a preponderance of the evidence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b510-7\">. The Insurers correctly argue that coverage for claims does not arise automatically from the fact that they are an exception to an exclusion, and that claims falling under such an exception must be covered by the insurance agreement, in general. <em>See Maryland Auto. Ins. Fund v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number><em>Baxter, </em>186 Md.App. 147, 163-64, 973 A.2d 243 (2009). Our opinion obviates this rule by subjecting each of RMG's claims to analysis under the entire agreement, regardless of whether it constituted an exception to an exclusion. But more importantly, our opinion does not implicate this rule in the first place; we are concerned <em>not </em>with an <em>exception </em>to an exclusion, but rather with the <em>complete absence </em>of <em>potential exclusion, </em>and what that implies about the meaning of the term that now has, <em>de jure, </em>no exclusions.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b512-8\">. We note that even if the Insurers had not waived the policy's contract exclusion, it would appear not to work in their favor. RMG claimed unjust enrichment and promissory estoppel as equitable <em>alternatives </em>to breach of contract. Therefore, these claims did <em>not </em>\"arise out of\u201d Blackstone\u2019s alleged breach of contract, or out of any other purported \"agreement.\u201d (These claims would, however, appear to be excluded as intentional or knowing acts.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b512-9\">. We reach all of these conclusions on the face of the complaint, so there is no need to rely on the extrinsic evidence that the Insurers argue should be excluded from consideration. <em>Montgomery Cnty. Bd. of Educ. v. Horace Mann Ins. Co., </em>383 Md. 527, 538, 860 A.2d 909 (2004) (citing <em>Aetna Cas. &amp; Sur. Co. v.

And because Blackstone\u2019s arguments are sufficient under its \"advertising idea\u201d policy coverage, we need not address the Insurers' argument that RMG did not allege the only other category of \u201cadvertising injury,\u201d infringement upon another\u2019s copyright, trade dress, or slogan.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b513-7\">.
