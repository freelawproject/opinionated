Leopold, appeals his conviction in the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County for two counts of misconduct in office. On March 2, 2012, Leopold was charged by indictment with four counts of misconduct in office (Counts 1-4) and fraudulent misappropriation by a fiduciary (Count 5). A bench trial began on January 18, 2013, and continued until January 29, 2013, at which time the circuit court found Leopold guilty of Counts 1 and 3. He was acquitted of the remaining charges.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b612-7\">On March 14, 2013, Leopold was sentenced to two years\u2019 imprisonment with all but 60 days suspended on Count 1. An identical and concurrent sentence was imposed as to Count 3. In addition, Leopold was placed on 5 years of supervised probation, ordered to pay a fine of $100,000.00, and ordered to complete 400 hours of community service by December 31, 2013. As a special condition of probation, the circuit court prohibited Leopold from \u201cbe[ing] a candidate for any local, state, or federal elected office.\u201d On March 15, 2013, Leopold filed this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-8\">Questions Presented</p>\n<p id=\"b612-9\">Leopold asks:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b612-10\">1. Whether the charge of Misconduct in Office, as applied to the facts of this case, denied Leopold due process of law as being unconstitutionally vague and overbroad?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b613-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>2. Whether the sentence imposed was illegal?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b613-4\">Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b613-5\">Leopold was twice elected to the office of the County Executive of Anne Arundel County. He was first sworn into office on December 4, 2006, and was reelected on November 2, 2010. Leopold succeeded Janet Owens who, during her time as County Executive, formed the Executive Protection Detail (\u201cEPD\u201d) for the purpose of \u201cproviding] security and protection to the County Executive while she was conducting County business.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b613-6\">The EPD consisted of sworn officers of the Anne Arundel County Police Department, known as Executive Protection Officers (\u201cEPO\u201d), each of whom was requested to have at least ten years of police experience prior to being selected for the unit. According to Patrick Shanahan, the Chief of Police at the time of the EPD\u2019s formation, the EPD was formed \u201crather quickly, ... by the seat of our pants, and we used as a basis for how that unit operated how other departments did theirs and followed State Law.\u201d Shanahan testified that, although a standard operating procedure (\u201cSOP\u201d) was \u201clater\u201d created for the EPD, one did not exist at the time of the EPD\u2019s formation. According to Lieutenant Katherine Goodwin, an EPO who served during Owens\u2019s tenure, no \u201cwritten protocol governing the do\u2019s and don\u2019ts for the [EPD]\u201d existed at the time of Leopold\u2019s trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-7\">Corporal Joseph Pazulski, an EPO who served under both Owens and Leopold, testified that his initial duties in the EPD were:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b613-8\">to pick Ms. Owens up at her residence, take her to her office which was at the Arundel Center in Annapolis. I would take her from event to event throughout the day and then I would also drop her off at the end of our tour of duty at her home. And our responsibilities were to be a driver as well as her security.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b614-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>Cpl. Pazulski also testified to running personal errands for Owens, such as getting a pack of cigarettes or buying her lunch.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Cpl. Pazulski explained that he did so:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b614-5\">[d]uring our workday if Ms. Owens was in the office and had a block of hours where she was having meetings at the office, we were stationed right there on the fourth floor, on the same wing as Ms. Owens\u2019s office and if I would go to lunch if I knew that she was going to be tied up during that day I would let her know that I was going to lunch, leaving the building and occasionally she asked me to bring her a sandwich back or grab her cigarettes on the way back.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b614-6\">Cpl. Pazulski stated that he \u201cdidn\u2019t do any campaigning\u201d for Owens, but admitted that he had some \u201cinvolvement with campaign signs.\u201d When asked to elaborate, he answered:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AIn\">If someone requested a campaign sign, there were campaign signs in our County vehicle that we drove. And if someone would request it I would just come out and hit the remote control on the trunk, the trunk would open, and the interested person would take the signs that they wanted and I would close the trunk.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b614-7\">Cpl. Pazulski stated that he did not place Owens\u2019s campaign signs in the trunk nor did he know who did. Cpl. Pazulski recalled that when signs were distributed, \u201csometimes [Owens] would be [present], sometimes she would not.\u201d Cpl. Pazulski testified that he sometimes took Owens to her campaign events, \u201cif [he] was working as her security.\u201d He stated that he never volunteered to assist in Owens\u2019s campaign and never touted her candidacy while he was present at her events. Cpl. Pazulski added that, during the Owens administration, EPOs kept records of mileage used for activities that were unrelated to Owens\u2019s role as County Executive, including mileage spent on campaign work. The EPOs, however, did not record the amount of time that the EPD spent in protect<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>ing Owens. The EPD continued to protect Leopold when he succeeded Owens as County Executive.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-5\">On January 15, 2010, Leopold contacted Dr. Roy Bands, Jr., an orthopedic surgeon, \u201ccomplaining of lower back pain and discomfort into his legs and his feet primarily while standing and walking.\u201d After evaluating Leopold and discussing the treatment options, Dr. Bands gave Leopold a Cortisone injection on January 28, 2010. Thereafter, Leopold became more symptomatic and was writhing in pain during his next visit to Dr. Bands\u2019s office.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-6\">On February 23, 2010, Dr. Bands performed a six-hour spinal surgery on Leopold, which included a laminectomy<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and stabilization of the bones.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> After the surgery, Leopold \u201cwasn\u2019t urinating on his own\u201d and therefore, Dr. Bands reinserted a Foley catheter that remained with Leopold following his discharge from the hospital. The catheter drained in a tube to a collection bag strapped to Leopold\u2019s ankle. Upon Leopold\u2019s release from the hospital, Dr. Bands stated that Leopold would not be able to \u201cbend over to put his socks on, ... change a dressing, ... empty his own foley bag ..., [or] drive a car.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b615-7\">Despite the surgery, Leopold continued to have low back pain. On July 2, 2010, Leopold consulted Dr. Timothy Burke, a neurological surgeon, who \u201ccame up with a surgical plan on how to deal with th[e] problem.\u201d On July 16, 2010, Leopold underwent another operation, this time to revise the fusion and to repair the fluid cyst that resulted from \u201ca tear of the covering of the spinal canal.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b615-8\">Cpl. Pazulski testified that after the surgeries, Leopold\u2019s level of independence changed. Two other EPOs, Corporal Howard Brown and Corporal Mark Walker, stated that they often drained urine from Leopold\u2019s collection bag into an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>empty coffee can for disposal. Cpl. Brown recalled that Leopold directed him to purchase the coffee container, which Cpl. Brown cleaned out and stored in the center console of the County Executive\u2019s vehicle. Cpl. Brown stated that he changed the catheter bag because he \u201cwas told to do it\u201d and \u201cdidn\u2019t think [he] had much recourse.\u201d Cpl. Walker, who testified to draining Leopold\u2019s urine at least 40 times, stated that he did not consider draining the catheter a part of his duties as an EPO but continued to do so because \u201cMr. Leopold told me to.\u201d At no time did Cpl. Walker tell Leopold that he did not want to drain the collection bag.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-5\">Cpl. Brown and Cpl. Walker reported their assignments to their supervisors on a regular basis. At no time did those supervisors instruct the EPOs not to undertake or participate in any of the activities assigned by Leopold. At trial, Cpl. Brown and Cpl. Walker admitted that they did not believe their actions\u2014in conjunction with Leopold\u2019s urine collection bag\u2014to be criminal.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-6\">Patricia Medlin, an assistant to Leopold, was, at the time of trial, 63 years old and a 16-year government employee of Anne Arundel County. Her entire career with the County was, in some capacity, within the County Executive\u2019s Office. In 2006, Leopold asked Medlin to become his scheduler. Medlin, who was asked to decide then and there, gave up her position as a \u201cmerit employee\u201d to become an \u201cat will employee.\u201d She believed that, by taking the position being offered by Leopold, she would serve at the pleasure of her employer, would have no job protection, and would have no job at the end of Leopold\u2019s administration.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-7\">Medlin recalled that following Leopold\u2019s first surgery, he called her into his office and told her that he had a catheter bag that he would not be able to empty and that he would \u201crequire\u201d her assistance. When Leopold asked if she had a problem with it, Medlin said no because she \u201cwas afraid\u201d to say otherwise. When asked to elaborate, Medlin explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AG8\">Because it was my experience that, oh how do I say this, that you don\u2019t tell him no because then he thinks your [sic], <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>he would consider you unloyal [sic] and I mean people lost their jobs, I\u2019ve seen it. And I need my job. So I\u2014I just didn\u2019t say no because I was scared of losing my job.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Aip\">Thereafter, she drained the collection bag about two or three times a day for approximately nine to ten months.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-5\">According to Medlin, whenever Leopold stood in the doorway of his office and said, \u201cPatty, I need you now,\u201d she knew that she needed to help empty the collection bag. Medlin would go to the bathroom, put gloves on, obtain the coffee can from under the sink, get down on her hands and knees, empty the urine out of the catheter bag into the can, empty the can into the toilet, and rinse out the can. Medlin continued to perform the task until she walked into Leopold\u2019s office one day and found him with his \u201cfoot bent and propped way up on [a heating register] and was bent over tying his shoe.\u201d At that point, Medlin \u201crealized that he could have been emptying his own catheter.\u201d She did not say anything to Leopold but instead returned to her desk. Medlin recounted that minutes later, Leopold came out of his office, walked over to a window near Medlin\u2019s desk, and \u201cputs his foot up on the heat register, standing beside [Medlin], and then was just looking out the window.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b617-6\">At trial, evidence was presented that on April 22, 2010\u2014two months after Leopold\u2019s first surgery\u2014a physician from Anne Arundel Urology gave Leopold a catheter plug to replace the urine collection bag. The medical report stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b617-7\">[Leopold] was given a \u201ctru-flo\u201d catheter plug and traditional catheter plug and instructions regarding use were reviewed. [Leopold] was advised that he may use catheter plug during the day with the understanding that he must drain his bladder [every] 2 hours. [Leopold was] advised that he must connect catheter to drainage bag at night. [Leopold] verbalize[d] understanding.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b617-8\">Leopold, however, continued to ask Medlin for assistance several months after he received the catheter plug.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-9\">As Leopold was recuperating from his surgeries, he enlisted the help of EPOs for his reelection campaign. Cpl. Brown <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>and Cpl. Walker were instructed to pick up campaign contributions from donors and to deposit them into the campaign bank account. Cpl. Brown also testified to creating dossiers on persons whom Leopold perceived to be political opponents, including Joanna Conti, his opponent in 2010. According to Cpl. Brown, those files included results from researching \u201cjudicial case search, their residence, anything on Google[,] ... MVA ... or ... NCIC.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b618-5\">On one occasion, both Cpl. Brown and Cpl. Walker were asked to unload approximately 1,000 campaign signs from the vehicle of Erik Robey, the assistant to Leopold\u2019s Chief Administrative Officer, and to place them in the basement of Leopold\u2019s home. In the days that followed, Leopold directed the EPOs to distribute those signs to people who came to Leopold\u2019s house and requested them. In addition, Cpl. Walker was instructed to place signs on people\u2019s properties around the county. Thereafter, the EPOs checked to make sure that the signs remained in place on a daily basis. For the most part, Leopold was not present when the EPOs performed these activities. Following the election, Leopold \u201crequired\u201d that the EPOs collect the signs they placed around the county and return them to his home.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-6\">Cpl. Brown testified that when he first began to put signs up, he told Leopold that he \u201cdidn\u2019t think it was a good idea,\u201d but Leopold directed him to continue. Cpl. Brown complied because he was \u201cfearful what the retribution would be if I told him I wasn\u2019t going to do something.\u201d According to Cpl. Brown, \u201c[y]ou don\u2019t tell Mr. Leopold no.\u201d On cross-examination, Cpl. Brown admitted that on one occasion, he refused Leopold\u2019s order to remove a Conti campaign sign and \u201cnothing happened\u201d to him as a consequence. He added, however, that Leopold \u201cwasn\u2019t real happy about it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b618-7\">Robey, Leopold\u2019s top aide during the campaign, did not think that what the EPOs were doing was \u201cillegal.\u201d Medlin, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>on the other hand, told Leopold around August 2010 that \u201che shouldn\u2019t have the officers putting up signs because that was not legal.\u201d Sergeant Timothy Phelan, a part-time EPO during Leopold\u2019s administration who testified at trial, recalled an incident where Leopold declined Sgt. Phelan\u2019s offer to \u201cfix a [campaign] sign out on the road\u201d and stated that \u201che [Leopold] had to do it because [Sgt. Phelan] wasn\u2019t supposed to be doing this.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b619-5\">In a ten-page indictment on March 2, 2012, Leopold was charged with four counts of misconduct in office and one count of fraudulent misappropriation by a fiduciary. Counts I and III, of which he would later be found guilty, stated in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b619-6\">\n<em>COUNT ONE\u2014MISCONDUCT IN OFFICE</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b619-7\">\n<em>Misfeasance\u2014Misuse of Executive Protection Officers for Political and Campaign Activities</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b619-8\">65. Between on or about June 25, 2010 and continuing to on or about November 16, 2010, at Anne Arundel County, Maryland, JOHN R. LEOPOLD, did, corruptly and in violation and perversion of his duties as the duly sworn County Executive of Anne Arundel County, to uphold, enforce and obey the laws of Anne Arundel County and the State of Maryland, commit misfeasance in office by knowingly, willfully and intentionally requiring, under the color of office, that Anne Arundel County employees, specifically, executive protection detail officers assigned to protect him, perform political and campaign activities and tasks while on duty and being paid by county monies, in violation of the common law and against the peace, government and dignity of the State.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b619-9\">\n<em>Common Law</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b619-10\">\n<em>COUNT THREE\u2014MISCONDUCT IN OFFICE</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b620-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>\n<em>Misfeasance\u2014Misuse of County Employees for Personal Purposes</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b620-4\">70. Between on or about February 17, 2010 and continuing to on or about May 15, 2011, at Anne Arundel County, Maryland, JOHN R. LEOPOLD, did, corruptly and in violation and perversion of his duties as the duly sworn County Executive of Anne Arundel County, to uphold, enforce and obey the laws of Anne Arundel County and the State of Maryland, commit misfeasance in office by knowingly, willfully and intentionally requiring, under the color of office and for his personal purposes, [that] Anne Arundel County employees, perform tasks and activities for his personal purposes and not for County purposes during the course of their regular work day and while being paid by county monies, in violation of the common law and against the peace, government and dignity of the State.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b620-5\">\n<em>Common Law</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b620-6\">A bench trial took place from January 18-29, 2013. At the conclusion, as to the above two counts, the circuit court, in finding Leopold guilty, ruled in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b620-7\">In Maryland, misconduct in office is a Common Law misdemeanor. It is corrupt behavior by a public officer in the exercise of the duties of his office or while acting under the color\u2014the color of his office.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b620-8\">The Maryland cases have recognized that the corrupt behavior can be characterized in various ways such as the doing of an act which is wrongful in and of itself, malfeasance, the doing of an act otherwise lawful in a wrongful manner, misfeasance, or the omitting to doing an act which is required by the duties of the office, nonfeasance.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b620-9\">Within each of the misconduct counts the State acknowledges that it must show that the Defendant acted corruptly and in violation and perversion of his duties as County <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>Executive. And it also acknowledges that it must show that the Defendant committed each count knowingly, willfully, and intentionally.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b621-4\">What corruptly means in this context has not been well defined. Some guidance is supplied by the commentary to the Maryland Pattern Jury Instructions in support of its instruction on misconduct in office....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b621-5\">This Court ... concludes that the Common Law, Maryland crime of misconduct in office is not unconstitutionally vague as a violation of due process.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b621-6\">Misconduct in office is defined as corrupt behavior by a public officer in the exercise of the duties of his office or while acting under color of his office. An act or conduct unrelated to the public official\u2019s duty, even if it is a violation of the Criminal Law will not amount to misconduct in office.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b621-7\">The first count is Count 1 of misconduct in office, which concerns the misuse of Executive Protection officers allegedly for political and campaign activities....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b621-8\">The first area is unloading of campaign signs....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b621-9\">The second area concerns sign placement and retrieval....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b621-10\">The third area is collection of campaign checks....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b621-11\">The fourth area is the creation of what is called dossiers....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b621-12\">The Defendant\u2019s efforts to involve his Executive Protection Officers in political and campaign activities as described <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>above in the discussion of each of these incidents\u2014his efforts were extensive and pervasive to the extent that at times the officers were working primarily on Leopold\u2019s campaign activities while on duty. Defendant was not only aware of this work, he directed that it be done, giving detailed and specific commands to the officers on such matters as addresses to place lawn signs and areas to be patrolled to ensure that signs continue to be in place.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b622-5\">Defendant was his own campaign manager. And Defendant was alerted on several occasions by his staff and by the officers themselves, that having the officers conduct such activities, while on duty, was questionable, not wise or potentially illegal.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b622-6\">At one point around August 2010, Ms. Medlin told him that he should not have officers putting up the signs quote, \u201cBecause it is not legal,\u201d end quote. According to Ms. Medlin he did not dispute this assertion or respond to it at all. Mr. Robey also told the Defendant he did not think having the officers put in signs was appropriate and suggested that the campaign hire college student [sic] to do it instead of having the officers do it. The Defendant rejected this suggestion.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b622-7\">After such warnings the Defendant not only ignored the warning from those close to him but continued the wrongful activity and accelerated it. The record indicates that at least on one occasion the Defendant acknowledged that he understood that having an on duty officer place signs along the highway was not allowed. Despite this awareness the Defendant proceeded to demand more campaign activity of the officers on behalf of his candidacy as the election neared.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b622-8\">It should have come to no surprise to Defendant that employing on duty sworn police officers to work on his election campaign was wrongful and illegal. Section 13-303 of Article XXIV of the Maryland Code provides that an employee of a local entity may not be required to provide <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>any political service. Section 13-105 further provides that an employee of a local entity, which Anne Arundel County is a local entity, may not engage in political activity while on the job during working hours.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b623-5\">Defendant, as an individual with decades of Governmental and election experience, was beyond a doubt aware that requiring [ ] on duty police officers to perform substantial services for his reelection campaign was wrongful and illegal.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b623-6\">By wrongfully taking substantial advantage of free public employee help for his campaign, an asset unavailable to his opponent, Defendant was placing his thumb on the scales of our political system to heavily tilt it in his favor. These actions robbed Anne Arundel County citizens of the fair political electoral process they were entitled to receive.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b623-7\">Defendant\u2019s actions were done systematically during the election season of 2010. Defendant committed these acts knowingly, willfully and intentionally and under the color of his office as County Executive. He did so corruptly and is guilty of this offense.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b623-8\">As to Count 3, Count 3 charges the misuse of County employees for personal purposes....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b623-9\">In theory!,] one could abstractly divide the actions of a County Executive into three categories, governmental, political and personal....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b623-10\">... There is no evidence that the officers were to make any distinction about whether an event was governmental, political or personal. There was virtually no guidance given in the SOP about activities that were not to be performed by the officers.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b623-11\">Similarly, the personal staff of the County Executive, such as Ms. Medlin, who were not merit system employees, were aid[e]s to the County Executive and the record does not demonstrate any particular constraints that apply to them except that it appears that the restrictions on political <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>activity during the work day, contained in Article XXIV of the Maryland Code, would apply.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b624-5\">There are five major categories described in the Indictment relating to this Count....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b624-6\">The final area[<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>] under this Count is,\u2014the urinary catheter collection bag duties----</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b624-7\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b624-8\">Defendant\u2019s demands on the officers and Ms. Medlin to care for his catheter bag are simply outrageous, egregious and wildly beyond any authority he possessed or could reasonably have thought he had obtained by virtue of his office. The task is one that with anyone\u2014anyone would have extreme difficulty asking someone else, even with a spouse or close relative, to do. The Defendant expected the police officers and Ms. Medlin to perform this task for him without comment, or complaint, demonstrates an overbearing arrogance and sense of entitlement and is unworthy of someone who is supposed to be a public servant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b624-9\">Defendant\u2019s conduct in regards to Ms. Medlin is particularly egregious. She had told the Defendant when she took the job in 2006 that she was very concerned about doing so since she was moving from a merit system job to one that was, quote, At-Will, end quote. He was aware of her age and the potential difficulties that she might have if she lost her job including the effect on her retirement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b624-10\">Given this knowledge and the power\u2014and the power imbalance between the Defendant and Ms. Medlin, his conduct appears predatory and cruel.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b625-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>This continuing abusive and outrageous conduct exceeded any right that any employer, either private or public, would have to demand of employees who were hired to perform office or security work. The fact that Ms. Medlin was labeled quote, a confidential assistant, end quote, did not provide license to Defendant to misuse Ms. Medlin as he did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b625-4\">In this Court\u2019s view the State has shown by proof beyond a reasonable doubt from this incident that the Defendant\u2019s conduct constituted criminal misconduct in office. Defendant committed these acts knowingly, willfully and intentionally and under the color of his office as County Executive.

In so doing, \u201c[w]e must consider the evidence in the light most favorable to the prevailing party and decide not whether the trial judge\u2019s conclusions of fact were correct, but only whether they were supported by a preponderance of the evidence.\u201d <em>Sifrit v.

Due Process</p>\n<p id=\"b626-5\">Leopold first argues that he was \u201cdeprived of due process, fair notice, and nondiscriminatory application of the law.\u201d He contends that because the term \u201cmisconduct in office\u201d is vague and amorphous and \u201cdoes not delineate standards of conduct nor the basis for duties alleged to be violated,\u201d the term has been \u201csusceptible to arbitrary application.\u201d Leopold broadly asserts that common law misconduct in Maryland does not afford him notice because the conduct alleged in the indictment is not clearly and unequivocally prohibited. Leopold notes that misconduct in office has been held by Maryland courts to include bribery, falsification of information or obstruction of justice, facilitation of the commission of an offense, and misappropriation of or failure to safeguard money or property. Because he was not alleged to have committed any of those acts, however, Leopold avers that the case law does not offer any notice to him or to others that his actions could or would be construed to be violations of the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-6\">In response, the State argues that \u201cthe common law crime of misconduct in office is not unconstitutionally vague and overbroad, nor is it unconstitutional as applied.\u201d The State also disagrees with Leopold\u2019s assertion that misconduct in office should be bridled to include a list of only six specific acts simply because those \u201ccriminal actions make up the majority of misconduct in office cases.\u201d The State suggests that, like the appellant in <em>Chester v. State, </em>32 Md.App. 593, 363 A.2d 605 (1976), Leopold demanded certain acts from his employees and coupled that demand with the threat of discharge from office and, therefore, the court correctly found him guilty of misconduct in office.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-7\">\u201cIn Maryland, misconduct in office is a common law misdemeanor.\u201d <em>Duncan v. State, </em>282 Md. 385, 387, 384 A.2d 456 (1978) (footnote omitted). It has been defined as \u201ccorrupt behavior by a public officer in the exercise of the duties of his office or while acting under color of his office.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing Perkins on Criminal Law 485 (2d ed.1969); <em>Hitzelberger v. State, </em>174 Md. 152, 197 A. 605 (1938)). The corrupt behavior <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>may be: (1) the doing of an act which is 'wrongful in itself, or \u201cmalfeasance;\u201d (2) the doing of an act otherwise lawful in a wrongful manner, or \u201cmisfeasance;\u201d or (3) the omitting to do an act which is required by the duties of the office, or \u201cnonfeasance.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citations omitted). Acts that qualify as misconduct in office include:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-5\">neglect or non-performance of any positive duty imposed by law; <em>oppressive and wilful abuse of authority </em>(to be distinguished from mere error of judgment); extortion; fraud or breach of trust affecting the public, such as rendering, passing or procuring false accounts, or wilfully neglecting to account for money received, or corruptly retaining money found upon a prisoner; grossly indecorous conduct, such as sitting as a justice while drunk, or getting drunk during time of service as a grand juror.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b627-6\"><em>Chester, </em>32 Md.App. at 606, 363 A.2d 605 (citation omitted and emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b627-7\">In this case, the circuit court found that Leopold was guilty of misconduct in office because he \u201cwrongfully [took] substantial advantage of free public employee help for his campaign\u201d and demanded, in a \u201cpredatory and cruel\u201d manner, that his assistant empty his urine collection bag. We agree with the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-8\">In <em>Chester, </em>this Court upheld the appellant\u2019s conviction for misconduct in office where the appellant was said to have demanded political contributions from his employees \u201cand coupl[ed] that demand with the threat of discharge from office.\u201d Likewise, here, we uphold Leopold\u2019s conviction on Count 1 because there was evidence to support the circuit court\u2019s finding that Leopold directed EPOs to wrongfully engage in \u201ccampaign activity\u201d on his behalf, as well as testimony that the EPOs complied only because \u201c[y]ou don\u2019t tell Mr. Leopold no.\u201d Although Leopold did not explicitly threaten his employees, he placed them in a position where they could not refuse his directions. In addition, the circuit court relied on the fact that Leopold was repeatedly advised and, on one occasion, acknowledged understanding, \u201cthat having an on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>duty officer place signs along the highway was not allowed.\u201d <em>See </em>Md.Code (2013 Repl. Vol.), \u00a7 1-304 of the Local Government Article<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> (\u201cAn employee of a governmental entity may not: (1) engage in political activity while on the job during working hours____\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b628-5\">We also uphold Leopold\u2019s conviction with regard to Count 3. As we stated in <em>Chester, </em>32 Md.App. at 606, 363 A.2d 605, a public officer is guilty of misconduct in office when he or she oppressively and wilfully abuses his or her authority. Here, there was evidence to support the trial court\u2019s finding that Leopold \u201cexpected\u201d the EPOs and Medlin to empty his urine collection bag, a task that \u201canyone would have extreme difficulty asking someone else ... to do.\u201d Medlin was very concerned when she accepted Leopold\u2019s offer for employment \u201csince she was moving from a merit system job to one that was ... At-Will[,]\u201d and Leopold was aware of Medlin\u2019s \u201cage and the potential difficulties that she might have if she lost her job.\u201d Leopold\u2019s continuing demands for Medlin to attend to his catheter bag, despite having been provided with a catheter plug months prior, was abusive and outrageous, and given the power imbalance between the two, Leopold\u2019s conduct was predatory, cruel, prompted by ill motive, and would constitute oppressive and wilful abuse of authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-6\">Making a similar argument to that made above, Leopold cites <em>Giaccio v. Pennsylvania, </em>382 U.S. 399, 402-03, 86 S.Ct. 518, 15 L.Ed.2d 447 (1966), and avers that the charge of misconduct in office \u201cfails to meet the requirements of the Due Process Clause [because] it is so vague and standardless that it leaves the public uncertain as to the conduct it prohibits or leaves judges and jurors free to decide, without any legally fixed standards, what is prohibited and what is not in each particular case.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Leopold avers that misconduct in office <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>was never codified in Maryland, and that convictions for that crime have been upheld \u201cwhere there have been acts of bribery, falsifying information or obstructing justice, facilitating the commission of an offense, or misappropriating of or failing to safeguard money or property.\u201d (Footnotes omitted). Because Leopold asserts that he did not commit these acts, he contends that he should not have been found guilty of Counts 1 and 3. According to Leopold, \u201c\u00a1tjhere are no cases with holdings that offer any notice\u201d to him that his actions \u201cwould be construed to be violations of the law\u201d and \u201c \u2018[rjeading the statute to proscribe a wider range of offensive conduct ... would raise due process concerns underlying the vagueness doctrine.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> <em>(Quoting Skilling v. United States, </em>561 U.S. 358, 130 S.Ct. 2896, 2931, 177 L.Ed.2d 619 (2010)).</p>\n<p id=\"b629-5\">This Court has previously reiterated the standards for evaluating vagueness as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b629-6\">Vague laws offend several important values. First, because we assume that man is free to steer between lawful and unlawful conduct, we insist that laws give the person of ordinary intelligence a reasonable opportunity to know what is prohibited, so that he may act accordingly. Vague laws <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number>may trap the innocent by not providing fair warning. Second, if arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement is to be prevented, laws must provide explicit standards for those who apply them. A vague law impermissibly delegates basic policy matters to policemen, judges, and juries for resolution on an ad hoc and subjective basis, with the attendant dangers of arbitrary and discriminatory applications. (Footnotes omitted).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b630-5\"><em>In re William G., </em>52 Md.App. 131, 133-34, 447 A.2d 493 (1982) (quoting <em>Grayned v. City of Rockford, </em>408 U.S. 104, 109, 92 S.Ct. 2294, 33 L.Ed.2d 222 (1972)). \u201cA law is not vague simply because it requires conformity to an imprecise normative standard.\u201d <em>Eanes v. State, </em>318 Md. 436, 459, 569 A.2d 604 (1990). \u201cThe touchstone is whether persons of common intelligence need reasonably guess at its meaning.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b630-6\">As the State notes in its brief, \u201c[t]here are areas of human conduct where, by the nature of the problems presented, legislatures simply cannot establish standards with great precision.\u201d <em>Smith v. Goguen, </em>415 U.S. 566, 581, 94 S.Ct. 1242, 39 L.Ed.2d 605 (1974). \u201cIt is self-evident that there is a whole range of conduct that anyone with at least a semblance of common sense would know is contemptuous conduct and ... [i]n these instances, there would be ample notice to the actor.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 584, 94 S.Ct. 1242 (White, J., concurring). Such is the case here. As the circuit court found, Leopold\u2019s actions were \u201coutrageous, egregious and wildly beyond any authority he possessed or could reasonably have thought he had obtained by virtue of his office.\u201d The person of ordinary intelligence would know that it is a violation of the law to direct your subordinates to engage in illegal activity, or to oppressively and wilfully abuse his or her authority to require an employee to perform offensive and unnecessary tasks wholly beyond their job descriptions.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> For these reasons, we reject Leo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"609\">*609</page-number>pold\u2019s contention that his constitutional rights were violated when the court convicted him of misconduct in office.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-5\">II. Illegal Sentence</p>\n<p id=\"b631-6\">Next, Leopold argues that \u201cthe court imposed an illegal sentence when as a condition of probation it prohibited [him] from running for office.\u201d Specifically, Leopold avers that \u201cthe separation of powers precludes trial courts from interfering in areas where the Legislature left the question of eligibility on who may seek elected office to the County Council and General Assembly.\u201d We agree with Leopold and hereby strike this condition of his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-7\">\u201c[A]n illegal condition of probation can be challenged as an illegal sentence.\u201d <em>Carter v. State, </em>193 Md.App. 193, 209, 996 A.2d 948 (2010) (citation omitted). Pursuant to Md. Rule 4-345(a), \u201c[t]he court may correct an illegal sentence at any time.\u201d Thus, \u201c[w]e may correct an illegal sentence on appeal even if no objection was made in the trial court.\u201d <em>Addison v. State, </em>191 Md.App. 159, 183, 990 A.2d 614 (2010) (citing <em>Ridgeway v. State, </em>369 Md. 165, 171, 797 A.2d 1287 (2002)).</p>\n<p id=\"b631-8\">Indeed, \u201c[a] judge has very broad discretion when imposing conditions of probation \u2018and may make such orders and impose such terms as to ... conduct ... as may be deemed proper....\u2019 \u201d <em>Sheppard v. State, </em>344 Md. 143, 145, 685 A.2d 1176 (1996) (quoting Md.Code (1957, 1996 Repl. Yol.), Art. 27, \u00a7 639(a)). That discretion, however, is not unlimited. <em>Id. </em>For example, appellate courts have held certain conditions of probation to be improper where the conditions violated the separation of powers. <em>See id. </em>at 145, 154, 685 A.2d 1176 (holding that \u201cthe trial judge abused his discretion in ordering, as a condition of probation, that Sheppard not operate a motor vehicle even if the MVA returns her driver\u2019s license\u201d because \u201c[t]he Transportation Article ... statutory scheme of regula<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"610\">*610</page-number>tion delegated to the executive branch controls over the general statute authorizing a court to impose conditions of probation\u201d); <em>Towers v. State, </em>92 Md.App. 183, 194, 607 A.2d 105 (1992) (holding that the trial court could not impose a probation condition that defendant not work in pharmacy without the court\u2019s permission even if defendant obtained license, because \u201cthe Legislature has left [the licensing and regulation of pharmacists] to the State Pharmacy Board, not the Circuit Court for Caroline County\u201d); <em>Smith v. State, </em>80 Md.App. 371, 374, 563 A.2d 1129 (1989) (holding that the trial court was without jurisdiction to impose a condition of probation prohibiting defendant from seeking to regain custody of her children without prior approval, following conviction of defendant for child abuse pursuant to guilty plea, because \u201cjurisdiction over the children rests with the Juvenile Court of Baltimore City\u201d); <em>see also In Re David K., </em>48 Md.App. 714, 725, 429 A.2d 313 (1981) (concluding that \u201ca juvenile court has no present authority directly to suspend a child\u2019s driving privileges upon a finding of delinquency\u201d because \u201c[t]hat is a power committed by statute exclusively to MVA\u201d); <em>accord Sheppard v. State, </em>344 Md. 143, 154, 685 A.2d 1176 (1996) (\u201cThis specific statutory scheme of regulation delegated to the executive branch controls over the general statute authorizing a court to impose conditions of probation.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b632-5\">The case of <em>U.S. v. Richmond, </em>550 F.Supp. 605 (E.D.N.Y. 1982), is instructive here. In that case, the defendant, \u201ca Member of Congress, agreed to plead guilty to income tax evasion (26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7201), supplementing the salary of a federal employee (18 U.S.C. \u00a7 209) and possession of marijuana (21 U.S.C. \u00a7 844).\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 606. \u201cHe also undertook to immediately resign from Congress and withdraw as a candidate for re-election\u201d and, in turn, the government \u201cconsented not to prosecute him for a variety of other crimes.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York held that \u201cthose portions of the plea agreement pertaining to resignation from Congress and withdrawal as a candidate for re-election are void\u201d because \u201c[t]hey represent an unconstitutional interference by the executive with the legisla<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"611\">*611</page-number>tive branch of government and with the rights of the defendant\u2019s constituents.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b633-4\">Similarly, here, the condition of probation imposed by the circuit court on Leopold must be stricken because, as asserted by Leopold, \u201cthe separation of powers precludes trial courts from interfering in areas where the Legislature left the question of eligibility on who may seek elected office to the County Council and the General Assembly.\u201d In Maryland, the Election Law Article establishes the requirements for candidacy for public office. <em>See </em>Md.Code (2003, 2010 Repl. Yol.), \u00a7 5-202, <em>et seq., </em>of the Election Law Article (\u201cEL\u201d) (listing, among others, minimum qualifications and residency requirement). In addition, \u201c[u]nder the constitution of Maryland, Art. 1, Section 4 and Section 12, one must be a qualified and registered voter in order to vote and to serve in an elective office.\u201d <em>U.S. v. Slatkin, </em>984 F.Supp. 916, 921 (D.Md.1995). In turn, an individual is disqualified from being a registered voter if he or she:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b633-5\">(1) has been convicted of a felony and is actually serving a court-ordered sentence of imprisonment, including any term of parole or probation, for the conviction;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b633-6\">(2) is under guardianship for mental disability and a court of competent jurisdiction has specifically found by clear and convincing evidence that the individual cannot communicate, with or without accommodations, a desire to participate in the voting process; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b633-7\">(3) has been convicted of buying or selling votes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b633-8\">EL \u00a7 3-102(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b633-9\">Leopold has not been convicted of a felony or of buying or selling votes, nor is he under guardianship for mental disability, thus qualifying him to be a registered voter. As a registered voter and a Maryland resident, and without evidence to the contrary, he is qualified and eligible to run for office pursuant to the Election Law Article and the Maryland Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-10\">Based upon the statutory scheme currently in place, Leopold may be removed from office \u201cby operation of law\u201d if <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"612\">*612</page-number>\u201cfound guilty of any crime ... which is a misdemeanor related to the elected official\u2019s public duties and responsibilities and involves moral turpitude for which the penalty may be incarceration in any penal institution.\u201d Md. Const. art. XV, \u00a7 2; <em>see Hall v. Prince George\u2019s Cnty. Democratic Cent. Comm., </em>431 Md. 108, 111, 64 A.3d 210 (2013) (Speaker of the House of Delegates, acting on the advice of Assistant Attorney General, declared a delegate removed from her House seat by operation of law \u201cafter she had been convicted and sentenced for the common law offense of misconduct in office\u201d). This is consistent with the provisions of the Anne Arundel County Charter, which states that \u201c[t]he office of the County Executive may be declared vacant by ordinance of the County Council with an affirmative vote of not less than five (5) members if, during his elected term, the County Executive ... is found guilty of ... a crime involving moral turpitude or misfeasance or malfeasance in office[.]\u201d Anne Arundel County Charter, art. IV, \u00a7 404. Because the Maryland Constitution and County Charter provide a method by which to remove the County Executive, we agree with Leopold that the circuit court, by prohibiting Leopold from being a candidate for elected office as a special condition of probation, improperly interfered with the process that has been put in place by the Legislature.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-5\">Relying on our recent decision in <em>Henson v. State, </em>212 Md.App. 314, 69 A.3d 26 <em>cert. denied, </em>434 Md. 314, 75 A.3d 319 (2013), the State contends that Leopold\u2019s probation condition is a \u201cnarrowly tailored punishment which relates directly to the offenses at the core of his conviction\u201d and, therefore, should be upheld. <em>Henson, </em>however, is distinguishable because, in that case, the challenged condition was \u201cworking in any capacity in election campaigns[,] whether it\u2019s in a voluntary status or paid.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 327, 69 A.3d 26. In upholding Henson\u2019s probation condition, Judge Matricciani, speaking for this Court, stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b634-6\"><em>And importantly, appellant\u2019s profession\u2014campaign consultant\u2014is not one subject to State licensing requirements.
