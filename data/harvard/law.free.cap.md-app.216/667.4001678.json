The court sentenced appellant to one year incarceration for the conviction of criminally negligent manslaughter.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b692-7\">On appeal, appellant presents two questions for our review, which we have rephrased slightly:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b692-8\">1. Did the circuit court err in denying appellant\u2019s motion to dismiss the indictment on the ground that Md.Code (2011 Supp.) \u00a7 2-210 of the Criminal Law Article (\u201cCL\u201d), governing criminally negligent manslaughter, is unconstitutionally vague?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b692-9\">2. Was the evidence sufficient to support appellant\u2019s conviction for criminally negligent manslaughter?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b692-10\">For the reasons set forth below, we shall affirm the judgments of the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-11\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b692-12\">In the early morning hours of October 22, 2011, appellant, a commercial tractor trailer driver, was driving eastbound on I-70, when he realized he was lost. He called Charles Cobb, a driver with the same company, for help with directions. Appellant called Mr. Cobb using a hands-free headset in his truck, and they spoke for approximately twenty minutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-13\">Appellant told Mr. Cobb that he was on 1-70 east. Mr. Cobb advised that 1-70 \u201cdead ends into a park and ride,\u201d and appellant needed to be driving on 1-70 west. Appellant pulled over and attempted to locate a map, but he could not find one. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"671\">*671</page-number>He then looked around and saw a \u201ccenter pull through\u201d area in the median, leading to 1-70 westbound.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-5\">Appellant was aware that he was not allowed to use the pull through area, which was a break in the grassy median for emergency vehicles.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> He was wary, however, to get off the highway at an exit that might not take him in the direction he needed to go. Observing that there was \u201chardly any traffic on the road,\u201d appellant looked around the bend in the road and saw that \u201ceverything was clear\u201d for about a quarter of a mile. He was unable to see anything beyond that point due to the curve in the road behind him. Appellant decided to pull out from the shoulder of the road and cross the three lanes of 1-70 east to turn around using the emergency access in the median. Before pulling out from the shoulder into the travel lanes, appellant looked for oncoming traffic, but after he pulled out, he was looking across the roadway toward the median.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-6\">As he pulled onto the highway to attempt to reach the median, appellant told Mr. Cobb that \u201ctwo vehicles were bearing down on him at a high rate of speed.\u201d He stated that one vehicle appeared to pass him, and then stated: \u201cI think someone ran into me.\u201d He felt the impact when his vehicle was halfway between the shoulder and the median. While still on the line with Mr. Cobb, appellant got out of the truck to inspect the damage, and upon returning stated: \u201cI believe this person has passed. I gotta go. I have, I have to call 911.\u201d The driver of the vehicle that collided with appellant\u2019s truck was Michael Neimus.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-7\">Mr. Neimus\u2019 friend, Raymond Bradshaw, testified that he met Mr. Neimus at 10:00 p.m. the evening of October 21, 2011, at Union Jack\u2019s, a restaurant and bar in Columbia. The two men stayed at the bar for several hours, talking and drinking, and they left \u201ca little bit before closing,\u201d just prior to 2:00 a.m. on October 22, 2011. Mr. Bradshaw and Mr. Neimus lived <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"672\">*672</page-number>close to each other in Baltimore County, and after leaving the bar, they planned to go to one of their houses. They drove in their respective cars toward their homes. Mr. Neimus was driving in front of Mr. Bradshaw in the middle lane of 1-70.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-5\">As they crossed over an overpass, Mr. Bradshaw saw a truck on the shoulder of the road. Immediately after he saw the truck, the truck \u201cswung out\u201d from the shoulder onto the roadway, leading him to believe the truck was taking a wide turn to get back onto the road. The truck, however, did not get into one of the eastbound lanes, but rather, it \u201ckept on coming,\u201d blocking \u201cthe whole highway.\u201d Mr. Bradshaw and Mr. Neimus both swerved into the left lane to try to avoid the truck, and then swerved back to the right as the truck blocked the roadway. Because Mr. Bradshaw was several car lengths behind Mr. Neimus, he had more time to move to the right. Mr. Neimus could not get to the right of the truck fast enough, and he hit the back right side of the truck before driving off the road. Crash reconstruction experts at the scene determined that Mr. Neimus was less than a foot away from avoiding the truck completely.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-6\">Both Mr. Neimus and Mr. Bradshaw were driving approximately 65 miles per hour at the time they went over the overpass and saw the truck; the speed limit on that portion of 1-70 was 65 miles per hour. After Mr. Bradshaw successfully swerved around the truck, he pulled over and stopped his car. He approached Mr. Neimus\u2019 vehicle and saw that Mr. Neimus\u2019 truck had fire underneath it, and Mr. Neimus\u2019 body had been pushed into the backseat. Mr. Bradshaw tried to get Mr. Neimus to respond, but he realized \u201cit was done.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b694-7\">Mr. Bradshaw stayed at the scene of the accident and waited for the police and paramedics to arrive. He gave oral and signed written statements to police describing what he observed. Investigators at the crash scene recovered one gram of marijuana from Mr. Neimus; Mr. Bradshaw was unaware that Mr. Neimus had marijuana on him. Mr. Nei<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"673\">*673</page-number>mus\u2019 blood alcohol level later was determined to be .14.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b695-4\">Trooper Boyce, a member of the Maryland State Police, received a call at 2:57 a.m. regarding a collision on 1-70 eastbound. When he arrived at the scene, he saw a Silver Chevy Tahoe on the right shoulder with \u201cheavy front end damage\u201d and a white tractor trailer in the emergency vehicle crossover. The fire department had all lanes on 1-70 blocked due to the collision.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-5\">Trooper Boyce approached the Chevy Tahoe and saw that the driver, Mr. Neimus, was deceased. Thereafter, he spoke to appellant. Appellant initially told Trooper Boyce that he had pulled his truck onto the right shoulder in order to look at a map, and he was struck from the rear by another vehicle. Trooper Boyce asked appellant to memorialize his account on a Driver Witness Statement form, and appellant recounted the same version of events that he told Trooper Boyce.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-6\">Trooper Bedell, the Collision Investigator for the Maryland State Police Crash Team and an expert in the field of accident reconstruction, responded to the scene at approximately 4:30 a.m. He read the witness statements provided by appellant and Mr. Bradshaw. He then approached appellant, who was still at the scene, and they walked the area of the collision together. Appellant gave Trooper Bedell an account of the accident that matched his written statement, asserting that he had been on the right shoulder looking at a map with his hazard lights on, and as he began to pull out into traffic, a vehicle struck the rear of his trailer. After the impact, appellant pulled into the emergency vehicle crossover area. Trooper Bedell asked appellant why he had pulled into the crossover after the accident, rather than stopping in the right <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"674\">*674</page-number>lane where he was struck, or pulling back onto the shoulder. Upon this line of questioning, appellant became nervous.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-5\">Trooper Bedell and appellant continued to walk the collision site, and when the area was cleared of emergency vehicles, Trooper Bedell was able to see various scrapes and other markings on the roadway. Based on the markings and other indications of where the impact had occurred, Trooper Bedell asked appellant whether he was intending to use the emergency vehicle crossover by driving from the right shoulder across the highway, requiring the two vehicles driven by Mr. Neimus and Mr. Bradshaw to swerve left and then right to avoid him. At that point, appellant stated that he wanted to revise his written statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-6\">Appellant\u2019s revised witness statement provided that, after he determined he was going east rather than west on 1-70, he pulled onto the shoulder. He then pulled onto the roadway and began to make a U-turn. Prior to pulling out onto the road, appellant looked both ways and did not see any oncoming traffic. As he was turning, he did not see a car approach, but he felt an impact when the vehicle collided with the back of his truck. In response to a question on the form asking if the accident could have been avoided, appellant answered in the affirmative, stating that he \u201cshouldn\u2019t have made the U-turn.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b696-7\">At the accident scene, Trooper Bedell asked appellant whether he was on a cell phone at the time of the collision, and appellant replied that he was not. Trooper Bedell also asked appellant whether he was in possession of any hands-free devices, and appellant stated that he did not have a hands-free device inside his vehicle. Trooper Bedell subsequently searched appellant\u2019s truck pursuant to a warrant, and he did not locate a hands-free device.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Later in his investigation of the collision, Trooper Bedell obtained appellant\u2019s cell phone records. He learned that appellant had made a cell phone call <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"675\">*675</page-number>to Mr. Cobb prior to the collision that lasted approximately 20 minutes, continuing past the time of the collision.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-4\">At appellant\u2019s trial, Trooper Bedell described the accident scene. The portion of 1-70 where the collision occurred was three lanes wide, with two shoulders. Each lane was 12 feet wide, and the shoulders were 9 to 10 feet wide; the roadway was 56 feet from edge to edge. Appellant\u2019s tractor trailer was approximately 70 feet long. Appellant\u2019s attempt to make a U-turn on the emergency vehicle crossover, which was a break in the grassy median between 1-70 east and west, left tire marks on the roadway, which Trooper Bedell used to verify the path of the vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-5\">As part of his investigation, Trooper Bedell obtained the \u201cblack boxes\u201d from both the tractor trailer and the Chevy Tahoe, which contained computer information from both vehicles. From the black box, as well as from vehicle marks at the scene and other data, Trooper Bedell determined that Mr. Neimus was traveling 62 miles per hour at the time he first swerved to attempt to avoid appellant\u2019s vehicle, which occurred 112 feet from impact. Using the black box from appellant\u2019s vehicle, he determined that appellant pulled onto the highway from the shoulder and accelerated to 10.5 miles per hour within 7 seconds before impact, when he slowed to a stop. Trooper Bedell calculated that, based on the speed of the vehicles and when appellant\u2019s truck began to pull out, Mr. Neimus had a little more than a second and a half to perceive and respond to the hazard. In his professional opinion, the cause of the accident was as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b697-6\">[T]he cause of the collision was that the commercial vehicle had made [its] ... turning maneuver, it had positioned [its] vehicle directly in front of the Chevrolet Tahoe in such a way that the, the available time and the available distance for a driver to respond was not enough to be able to ... safely avoid the collision.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b697-7\">Prior to announcing its verdict, the court commented on the criminal negligence statute, CL \u00a7 2-210, as follows: \u201cIt\u2019s a new Statute, but it\u2019s not an overly cumbersome Statute. I don\u2019t believe that this is a difficult Statute to apply under the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"676\">*676</page-number>circumstances of this case. Maybe under another, maybe one of those other cases hypothetically referred to it may be. [B]ut not ... in this one.\u201d The court then stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b698-5\">This is a situation where a driver of a seventy foot tractor trailer was approximately a quarter of a mile from a curve in the road, where the speed limit is sixty-five miles per hour, in the dark, with and I note exhibit[s] show, no street lights in that area of 1-70, moves from the ... right shoulder to the far left median in one move. By his own testimony, he looked in his rear view mirror before he moved from the shoulder into the lane of travel, but didn\u2019t do so again as he crossed ... from the middle lane to the far left lane. And that maneuver was completely unexpected for good reason. Doing so while he was on the phone hands free or not, frankly only elevates the level of negligence, but in my view the maneuver itself meets the definition of a gross deviation from the standard of care. I want to address the, the issue that was raised with regard to the victim in this case and his blood alcohol level. While it is true that level of alcohol can certainly impair one\u2019s ability to react quickly to unanticipated circumstances[,] I think the evidence is clear that, in this case at least, there was no negligence on the part of the victim in the way that he handled his vehicle.... And I do find that the conduct on the part of this Defendant, while not intentional, does meet the requirements of criminal negligence was is defined in [CL \u00a7 2-210]. So, I find him guilty of count one [criminally negligent manslaughter].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b698-6\">The court found appellant guilty of all other charges. After merging the lesser convictions with the conviction for criminally negligent manslaughter, the court sentenced appellant to one year imprisonment. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b698-8\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-9\">Void for Vagueness</p>\n<p id=\"b698-10\">Appellant\u2019s first contention is a challenge to the constitutionality of CL \u00a7 2-210, entitled \u201cCausing death of another <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"677\">*677</page-number>by operation of vehicle or vessel in criminally negligent manner.\u201d He asserts that the statute is unconstitutionally vague, and therefore, the circuit court erred in denying his motion to dismiss the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-4\">CL \u00a7 2-210, which became effective on October 1, 2011, provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b699-5\">(a) In this section, \u201cvehicle\u201d includes a motor vehicle, streetcar, locomotive, engine, and train.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b699-6\">(b) A person may not cause the death of another as the result of the person\u2019s driving, operating, or controlling a vehicle or vessel in a criminally negligent manner.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b699-7\">(c) For purposes of this section, a person acts in a criminally negligent manner with respect to a result or a circumstance when:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b699-8\">(1) the person should be aware, but fails to perceive, that the person\u2019s conduct creates a substantial and unjustifiable risk that such a result will occur; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b699-9\">(2) the failure to perceive constitutes a gross deviation from the standard of care that would be exercised by a reasonable person.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b699-10\">(d) It is not a violation of this section for a person to cause the death of another as the result of the person\u2019s driving, operating, or controlling a vehicle or vessel in a negligent manner.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b699-11\">(e) A violation of this section is criminally negligent manslaughter by vehicle or vessel.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b699-12\">(f) A person who violates this section is guilty of a misdemeanor and on conviction is subject to imprisonment not exceeding 3 years or a fine not exceeding $5,000 or both.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b699-13\">Appellant contends that the elements of criminally negligent manslaughter are \u201cvague and ambiguous\u201d because they \u201cfail to provide [a defendant] with adequate notice of the conduct prohibited.\u201d He further argues that, as written, the statute is so broad that it could be subject to irrational or selective enforcement.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"678\">*678</page-number>The State argues that CL \u00a7 2-210 is not unconstitutionally vague. It contends that \u201c[t]he meaning of the term \u2018criminal negligence\u2019 as expressly defined\u201d in the statute \u201cis clear on its face,\u201d and the meaning of this term \u201cbecomes no less clear when placed in the larger context of Maryland jurisprudence governing\u201d the concept of gross negligence. The State asserts that, \u201c[bjecause no person of ordinary intelligence would necessarily have to guess at the statute\u2019s meaning, and because the statute provides enforcement standards narrow enough to forfend irrational and selective patterns of enforcement, the circuit court was correct to rule that [CL] 2-210 is not unconstitutionally vague.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b700-4\">In addressing a claim involving the constitutionality of a statute, we begin \u201cwith a presumption that the statute is constitutional.\u201d <em>Walker v. State, </em>432 Md. 587, 626, 69 A.3d 1066 (2013) (citing <em>Galloway v. State, </em>365 Md. 599, 610, 781 A.2d 851 (2001)). The appellant bears the burden of overcoming this presumption and establishing the statute\u2019s unconstitutionality. <em>Id. Accord Livingston v. State, </em>192 Md.App. 553, 568, 995 A.2d 812 (2010) (\u201cWhen the challenge to a statute is based on vagueness, the burden of establishing unconstitutionality is on the party attacking the statute.\u201d). We will not find a statute unconstitutional if, \u201c \u2018by any construction, it can be sustained.\u2019 \u201d <em>Galloway, </em>365 Md. at 611, 781 A.2d 851 (quoting <em>Beauchamp v. Somerset County, </em>256 Md. 541, 547, 261 A.2d 461 (1970)).</p>\n<p id=\"b700-5\">\u201cWhen considering whether a law is void for vagueness, courts consider two criteria.\u201d <em>State v. Phillips, </em>210 Md.App. 239, 265, 63 A.3d 51 (2013). The first is whether the statute is \u201c \u2018sufficiently explicit to inform those who are subject to it what conduct on their part will render them liable to its penalties.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 266, 63 A.3d 51 (quoting <em>Livingston, </em>192 Md.App. at 568, 995 A.2d 812). \u201cThe standard for determining whether a statute provides fair notice is \u2018whether persons of \u201ccommon intelligence must necessarily guess at [the statute\u2019s] meaning.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Galloway, </em>365 Md. at 615, 781 A.2d 851). \u201c \u2018A statute is not vague under the fair notice <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"679\">*679</page-number>principle if the meaning of the words in controversy can be fairly ascertained by reference to judicial determinations, the common law, dictionaries, treatises or even the words themselves if they possess a common and generally accepted meaning.\u2019 \u201d <em>Walker, </em>432 Md. at 626, 69 A.3d 1066 (quoting <em>McFarlin v. State, </em>409 Md. 391, 411, 975 A.2d 862 (2009)).</p>\n<p id=\"b701-5\">The second factor for consideration under the vagueness doctrine addresses the enforcement of the statute. As this Court recently explained criminal statutes must</p>\n<p id=\"AB8s\">\u201cprovide legally fixed standards and adequate guidelines for police, judicial officers, triers of fact and others whose obligation it is to enforce, apply and administer the penal laws.\u201d <em>[Livingston, </em>192 Md.App. at 569, 995 A.2d 812.] \u201c[A] statute is not unconstitutionally vague merely because it allows for the exercise of some discretion on the part of law enforcement and judicial officials.\u201d <em>Galloway, </em>365 Md. at 616 [781 A.2d 851]. \u201cRather, \u2018[i]t is only where a statute is so broad as to be susceptible to irrational and selective patterns of enforcement that it will be held unconstitutional under this second arm of the vagueness principle.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"AVZ\"><em>Phillips, </em>210 Md.App. at 266, 63 A.3d 51.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-6\">Here, appellant\u2019s vagueness challenge is to the term \u201ccriminal negligence\u201d in CL \u00a7 2-210. Acknowledging that the statute creates a new legal standard,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> he asserts that it does not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"680\">*680</page-number>clearly dictate where this standard falls between the existing concepts of \u201csimple negligence\u201d and \u201cgross negligence.\u201d Therefore, he contends, \u201cthe Legislature has made it impossible\u201d for a trier of fact to \u201cdetermine the precise standard to apply.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b702-4\">Appellant notes that, in several cases decided prior to the enactment of CL \u00a7 2-210, Maryland courts used the term criminal negligence interchangeably with the term gross negligence. He argues that \u201c[t]he absence of a definition of \u2018criminal negligence\u2019 separate from its consistent and interchangeable use of the terms \u2018gross negligence\u2019 creates inherent ambiguity with its use in C[L] \u00a7 2-210.\u201d Accordingly, he asserts, a person of ordinary intelligence \u201cwould have to guess at the meaning of \u2018criminal negligence\u2019 as distinguished from other forms of negligence under Maryland Law,\u201d and a trier of fact would have no guidance as to \u201cwhere on the spectrum this hybrid [form of negligence] would fall.\u201d We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-5\">To be sure, Maryland courts previously have used the terms criminal negligence and gross negligence interchangeably in the context of interpreting other statutory provisions. <em>See State v. Albrecht, </em>336 Md. 475, 499, 649 A.2d 336 (1994) (\u201c \u2018It is well settled in this State that where a charge of involuntary manslaughter is predicated on negligently doing some act lawful in itself, the negligence necessary to support a conviction must be gross or criminal, <em>viz., </em>such as manifests a wanton or reckless disregard of human life.\u2019 \u201d) (quoting <em>Mills v. State, </em>13 Md.App. 196, 200, 282 A.2d 147 (1971)); <em>State v. Gibson, </em>4 Md.App. 236, 242, 242 A.2d 575 (1968) (same), <em>aff'd, </em>254 Md. 399, 254 A.2d 691 (1969); <em>Craig v. State, </em>220 Md. 590, 597, 155 A.2d 684 (1959) (in case involving involuntary manslaughter, \u201cif the basis of the charge be felonious negligence ... it must have been gross or criminal negligence ... which has been interpreted by this Court to mean []a \u201cwanton or reckless disregard for human life\u2019 \u201d) (quoting <em>Hughes v. State, </em>198 Md. 424, 432, 84 A.2d 419 (1951)). At the time those cases <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"681\">*681</page-number>were decided, however, the only form of criminal, as opposed to civil, negligence was gross negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-5\">With the enactment of CL \u00a7 2-210, however, criminal negligence is defined as a standard distinct from gross negligence. The General Assembly made clear this intent by stating that the term \u201c \u2018gross deviation from the standard of care\u2019 in \u00a7 2-210(c)(2) of the Criminal Law Article, as enacted by Section 1 of this Act ... is a separate and distinct standard from the \u2018gross negligence\u2019 standard that is used by and interpreted under \u00a7 2-209 of the Criminal Law Article.\u201d 2011 Md. Laws Ch. 334, sec. 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-6\">Indeed, the elements of the offense clearly are different. CL \u00a7 2-209, manslaughter by vessel or vehicle, provides that a person may not cause the death of another by driving or operating a vehicle in a \u201cgrossly negligent manner.\u201d Gross negligence results when the defendant is \u201cconscious of the risk to human life [posed by] his or her conduct,\u201d <em>Dishman v. State, </em>352 Md. 279, 299, 721 A.2d 699 (1998), but he or she nevertheless proceeds, demonstrating \u201ca wanton or reckless disregard for human life.\u201d <em>DeHogue v. State, </em>190 Md.App. 532, 547, 989 A.2d 759 (2010). CL \u00a7 2-210, criminally negligent manslaughter, however, criminalizes the defendant\u2019s failure to perceive a substantial and unjustified risk that death would occur. Thus, the two offenses differ in the defendant\u2019s mental state, i.e., his or her consciousness of the risk of his or her conduct. <em>See </em>96 Op. Md. Att\u2019y Gen. 128.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-7\">Thus, there now exists a clear distinction between criminally negligent manslaughter and manslaughter by operating a vehicle in a grossly negligent manner. The question here is whether CL \u00a7 2-210 provides constitutionally sufficient guidance regarding the proscribed conduct. We answer that question in the affirmative.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-8\">As indicated, CL \u00a7 2-210 provides that \u201ca person acts in a criminally negligent manner\u201d when \u201c(1) the person should be aware, but fails to perceive, that the person\u2019s conduct creates a substantial and unjustifiable risk that such a result will occur;\u201d and \u201c(2) the failure to perceive constitutes a gross <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"682\">*682</page-number>deviation from the standard of care that would be exercised by a reasonable person.\u201d We agree with the State that this language \u201cis sufficiently clear that there is no need to look beyond its language to understand its meaning.\u201d <em>Parker v. State, </em>189 Md.App. 474, 484, 985 A.2d 72 (2009). The statute explains the scope of criminal negligence in clear, readily understandable terms.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b704-5\">Indeed, other courts have upheld criminally negligent homicide statutes against vagueness challenges, where the statute criminalizes the failure to perceive a \u201csubstantial and unjustifiable risk,\u201d and where the failure to perceive constitutes \u201cgross deviation from the standard of care\u201d that an ordinary person would exercise. <em>See Panther v. Hames, </em>991 F.2d 576, 580 (9th Cir.1993); <em>State v. Butler, </em>880 S.W.2d 395, 397 (Tenn.Crim.App.1994); <em>Thompson v. State, </em>676 S.W.2d 173, 175 (Tex.App.1984). In <em>Butler, </em>880 S.W.2d at 397, the court stated that the statutory definition of criminal negligence related to \u201c(1) the defendant\u2019s conduct, (2) a substantial and justifiable risk existing at the time of the conduct or resulting from the conduct, (3) the defendant\u2019s failure ... to perceive the risk, and (4) that failure being a gross deviation from the standard of care.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"683\">*683</page-number>Under those circumstances, the court held that \u201cthe statutory definition provides adequate notice of what conduct is covered.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b705-4\">In <em>State v. Randol, </em>226 Kan. 347, 597 P.2d 672, 673 (1979), the Kansas Supreme Court addressed a vagueness challenge to the state\u2019s vehicular homicide statute, which addressed conduct that \u201ccreates an unreasonable risk of injury to the person or property of another and which constitutes a material deviation from the standard of care which a reasonable person would observe under the same circumstances.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 675. The court stated that a \u201cmaterial deviation\u201d from the standard of care required \u201csomething more than ordinary or simple negligence yet something less than gross and wanton negligence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 676. Noting that the latter two terms \u201chave been ingrained in our law for years and are now generally accepted and understood,\u201d it found that the statute creating a new, intermediate standard based on a \u201cmaterial deviation,\u201d which was the same as a \u201csubstantial deviation,\u201d was not unconstitutionally vague. <em>Id. </em>at 676-77.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-5\">These cases support our holding that CL \u00a7 2-210 is not unconstitutionally vague. The statute, which criminalizes a failure to perceive a substantial risk, when the failure constitutes a gross deviation from the standard of care exercised by a reasonable person, informs persons of ordinary intelligence of the prohibited conduct, and it provides a legally enforceable standard. The circuit court properly denied appellant\u2019s motion to dismiss the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-7\">Sufficiency of the Evidence</p>\n<p id=\"b705-8\">Appellant next contends that the evidence was insufficient to support his conviction for criminally negligent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"684\">*684</page-number>manslaughter. His assertion in this regard mirrors his constitutional vagueness argument. He argues that \u201c[t]he interchangeability of \u2018criminal negligence\u2019 and \u2018gross negligence\u2019 ... create an irreconcilable ambiguity within that element of the statute,\u201d and the circuit court\u2019s failure to recognize the ambiguity in the statute\u2019s definition or to clarify that ambiguity \u201crequires reversal of [his] convictions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b706-5\">This Court recently explained the test for appellate review of evidentiary sufficiency:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b706-6\">[W]hether, \u201c \u2018after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Coleman, </em>423 Md. 666, 672 [33 A.3d 468] (2011) (quoting <em>Facon v. State, </em>375 Md. 435, 454 [825 A.2d 1096] (2003)). The Court\u2019s concern is not whether the verdict is in accord with what appears to be the weight of the evidence, \u201cbut rather is only with whether the verdicts were supported with sufficient evidence\u2014that is, evidence that either showed directly, or circumstantially, or supported a rational inference of facts which could fairly convince a trier of fact of the defendant\u2019s guilt of the offense charged beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>State v. Albrecht, </em>336 Md. 475, 479 [649 A.2d 336] (1994). \u201cWe \u2018must give deference to all reasonable inferences [that] the fact-finder draws, regardless of whether [the appellate court] would have chosen a different reasonable inference.\u2019 \u201d <em>Cox v. State, </em>421 Md. 630, 657 [28 A.3d 687] (2011) (quoting <em>Bible v. State, </em>411 Md. 138, 156 [982 A.2d 348] (2009)).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b706-7\"><em>Donati v. State, </em>215 Md.App. 686, 718, 84 A.3d 156 (2014).</p>\n<p id=\"b706-8\">Here, the circuit court made extensive factual findings in support of its verdict, which appellant does not contest. Specifically, the court found that appellant drove his 70-foot tractor trailer, in the dark, across three lanes of traffic on a highway where the speed limit was 65 miles per hour. Due to his location near the curve of the road, he could see only a distance of a quarter mile.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"685\">*685</page-number>This evidence supports the court\u2019s finding that appellant\u2019s conduct created a substantial and unjustifiable risk of death, and his failure to perceive this risk was a gross deviation from the standard of care that would be exercised by a reasonable person.
