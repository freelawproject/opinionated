Mr. Prince was charged with attempted murder and other charges, tried before a jury in the Circuit Court for Montgomery County, and convicted. On appeal, he challenges the circuit court\u2019s decision to allow the State to introduce the testimony about the rifle\u2019s firing pattern and the bullet\u2019s trajectory through the roof and interior of her car. He also contends that the trial court improperly denied his counsel\u2019s request for a continuance to allow him to develop expert testimony regarding his mental state. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-10\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b204-11\">Mr. Prince moved into the Bethesda apartment complex of his then-girlfriend, Allanna Garbe on August 28, 2010. Ms. Garbe had discouraged the move; she felt their relationship should move more slowly, but he apparently saw things differently and took an apartment one floor up from hers in the same building. The transition went badly and, as we shall see, spiraled quickly from there: Mr. Prince felt \u201cdisappointed and upset\u201d when Ms. Garbe did not help him move in, and Ms. Garbe expressed discomfort at how quickly he viewed the relationship as progressing. On the evening of September 1, 2010, she went to his apartment and, in a conversation that lasted thirty to forty minutes and that she later characterized <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>as \u201cpeaceful,\u201d she told him that she no longer wanted to be in a relationship.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-4\">A few nights later, on September 3, 2010, Mr. Prince saw Ms. Garbe leave her apartment with a male friend. He sent her a series of text messages beginning around 10:00 p.m. asking what she was doing and telling her that he loved her. His behavior escalated from there: he showed up at Ms. Garbe\u2019s apartment within moments after she and her friend returned to her apartment (around midnight), and when she came out to speak with him, he seemed not to understand that she had broken up with him, then remained in the hallway twenty minutes after their conversation ended. Ms. Garbe felt uncomfortable and afraid, so her friend remained in her apartment with her through the night. Mr. Prince continued to send text messages that night and through the morning, finally culminating in a 4:46 a.m. text in which he stated, \u201cYou told me you loved me and hoped we could get married one day. You brought another man in your bed tonight. How could you live with yourself?\u201d Mr. Prince also had a conversation in the parking garage in the early morning hours with two other residents of the complex (whom he had never met), telling them in depth about the relationship and his dismay that Ms. Garbe chose to end it.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-5\">The next morning, Ms. Garbe discovered that someone had vandalized her car during the night. The doors, trunk, roof, and hood of the car were dented and both the side mirrors had been ripped off. On the recommendation of police officers who responded to her call, she obtained a no-contact order against Mr. Prince that same day. When Mr. Prince learned about the order, he asked Ms. Garbe by text to withdraw it. He said he did not believe that she had no other romantic interest, and he continued texting her throughout the evening.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> For the remainder of Labor Day weekend, September 5 and 6, though, the two did not communicate.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>Sometime between 7:00 and 7:30 a.m. Tuesday morning, September 7, Ms. Garbe went to her car, which was parked on the third floor of the parking garage. She climbed in the driver\u2019s side, but before closing the door she sensed movement, looked up, and saw Mr. Prince on a ramp between the third and fourth floors of the garage, where he \u201chad just stooped down and had a rifle pointed at me.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> When asked to describe the rifle, she explained it was \u201c[j]ust a very large gun that he had over one shoulder <em>directly pointed at me.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) Ms. Garbe scrambled out of the car and hid behind the rear bumper. The two or three times she looked up, she \u201csaw [Mr. Prince] with the gun just pointed directly at [her], taking full aim at [her].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b206-5\">After she heard a gunshot, Ms. Garbe looked again and saw that Mr. Prince was no longer aiming at her, so she ran into the apartment building and called 911. Minutes later, she received a new series of texts from Mr. Prince:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b206-6\">\u2022 \u201cI never would have hurt you honestly\u201d;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b206-7\">\u2022 \u201cI pictured my life without you and you with another man and I snapped\u201d;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b206-8\">\u2022 \u201cI know I can\u2019t take this back\u201d; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b206-9\">\u2022 \u201cI know I just threw away my life.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b206-10\">Ms. Garbe responded (having been told by the police to do so), and encouraged Mr. Prince to turn himself in, which he did. An investigation of the fourth-floor ramp in the garage uncovered a garment bag, a live round of ammunition, and a cartridge casing. Police also searched Mr. Prince\u2019s apartment and found an open rifle case by his bedside. Moreover, after hearing a recorded conversation between Mr. Prince (incarcerated at the time) and a friend, police interviewed the friend, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>who produced a box of ammunition that Mr. Prince had asked him to hide and from which three rounds were missing.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-5\">The State charged Mr. Prince with attempted first-degree murder, first-degree assault, carrying a dangerous weapon with intent to injure, and failing to comply with a peace order. He underwent a mental health evaluation at Clifton T. Perkins Hospital Center by psychologist Inna Toller. In January 2011, Dr. Toller rendered a report in which she found him competent to stand trial and criminally responsible. Although she acknowledged that Mr. Prince suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder (\u201cPTSD\u201d) from his military experience in Iraq as a medic, Dr. Toller concluded that it played no role in his conduct: \u201c[Tjhere is no evidence that [his PTSD] symptoms caused him to have significant impairment in every day function.\u201d She opined, based on how Mr. Prince acted on the morning of the incident, that \u201cthe PTSD and the adjustment disorder did not cause him to lack substantial capacity either to appreciate the criminality of his conduct or to conform his conduct to the requirements of the law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b207-6\">Trial was scheduled to begin on Monday, March 26, 2012. On the afternoon of Friday, March 23, 2012, Mr. Prince moved for a continuance. He argued that he had obtained a preliminary report from a psychologist, Rona Fields, Ph.D. (the \u201cFields Report\u201d), in which, he said, she opined that Mr. Prince <em>\u201cmost likely </em>suffered\u201d from PTSD at the time of the incident (emphasis added).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> According to the motion, Mr. Prince had only recently been able to gather funds for Dr. Fields\u2019s preliminary evaluation and she needed more time to complete testing and determine whether he might suffer organic brain damage or whether his PTSD contributed to the incident. The State opposed the motion, citing the facts that the incident had taken place over a year and a half earlier, that there had already been an aborted plea deal, that the case had been continued twice already, and that Ms. Garbe objected strongly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>(even at the time of trial, Mr. Prince apparently still was attempting to contact her).</p>\n<p id=\"b208-5\">The trial court denied the motion on the morning of trial, explaining (over five pages of transcript) that Dr. Toller had reviewed all the relevant history and documents, and had concluded Mr. Prince\u2019s mental health issue had nothing to do with the events in question:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b208-6\">the PTSD and the adjustment order did not cause him to lack substantial capacity either to appreciate the criminality of his conduct or to conform his conduct t'o the requirements of the law. Therefore, to a reasonable degree of medical certainty, Prince was found [by Dr. Toller] to be criminally responsible.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b208-7\">The court noted that Dr. Toller believed Mr. Prince \u201chad a clear secondary gain to avoid incarceration and be found not criminally responsible,\u201d and, as a result, had diagnosed him with malingering. For these reasons, the court found no good cause to continue the trial and it went forward as scheduled.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-8\">The State presented seven witnesses in its case-in-ehief, beginning with Ms. Garbe and including two police officers whose testimony Mr. Prince challenges here. Detective Brian Stafford, who responded to the 911 call, interviewed Ms. Garbe, videotaped the scene, and documented the area where Mr. Prince stood at the time of the shooting. Officer Ryan Costello examined Ms. Garbe\u2019s car after it was brought in to police for processing and, as part of his examination, placed \u201ctrajectory rods\u201d through the bullet holes in the car and photographed the rods in place.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b208-9\">Neither Officer Costello nor Detective Stafford was offered or qualified as an expert witness. The State had notified counsel for Mr. Prince two weeks before trial that it planned to call expert witnesses \u201cin crime scene and trajectory\u201d (Offi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>cer Costello) and \u201cin weapons and ballistics\u201d (Detective Stafford), but counsel for Mr. Prince moved <em>in limine </em>to preclude the testimony based on the State\u2019s lack of formal or timely notice of the experts. At a hearing on the morning of trial, the State informed the court that it had intended to call Officer Costello as an expert, but had changed its mind: \u201c[i]n reality, his testimony is really factual, so we have no problem ... we don\u2019t need to qualify him as an expert, so we won\u2019t.\u201d In response, counsel for Mr. Prince acknowledged voluntarily that his motion was moot. The parties did not discuss Detective Stafford\u2019s testimony at that point (the whole colloquy occupies less than a page of transcript), either by naming him or by talking generically about any ballistics testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-5\">When the time came for Detective Stafford to testify, he offered a detailed account\u2014without objection from Mr. Prince\u2019s counsel\u2014about the live round found on the scene:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b209-6\">Q. And could you please describe what type of ammunition that is?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b209-7\">A. It\u2019s a 7.62 NATO full metal jacket round, standard military loading.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b209-8\">Q. <em>You say that like we should all know. </em>Give us the numbers that you first said?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b209-9\">A. 7.62 NATO.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b209-10\">Q. <em>What does that mean? </em>What is the 7.62?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b209-11\">A. The 7.62 refers to the diameter of the bullet.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b209-12\">Q. Okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b209-13\">A. It\u2019s basically a 30 caliber bullet. NATO, it refers to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. In the 1950s, NATO wanted to come up with a common round for all the member countries to use. This is the ammunition they standardized, largely because the United States insisted on a 30 caliber cartridge.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b209-14\">Q Okay. <em>And what is the significance of the markings on here?</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b209-15\">A. These are what are called head stamp markings. They\u2019re on the head of the case. This one says NATO <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>on it. There is a letter on there, F, and then there\u2019s a number, which is 81.81 would be for the year of manufacture, the year that this ammunition was manufactured.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b210-4\">Q. So in 1981?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b210-5\">A. Yes. And the F would identify the armory or the factory where it was made.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b210-6\">Q. Okay, anything ... that you note of significance on [Exhibit] 32?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b210-7\">A. Well, this doesn\u2019t have a firing pin.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b210-8\">Q. Oh, I\u2019m sorry.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b210-9\">A. This has a primer, which is struck by the firing pin when you fire the round.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b210-10\">Q. Okay, and <em>is there anything of significance </em>that would indicate how this bullet came to be ejected from a rifle?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b210-11\">A. There is. There\u2019s a small dimple or marking in the middle of the primer. It\u2019s consistent with where the firing pin would have struck the primer in order to fire the round. It\u2019s not very deep. It\u2019s really just a superficial mark, but <em>it indicates to me that it was most likely a misfire.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b210-12\">Q. Okay. What\u2019s this green stuff[<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>] that we\u2019re seeing?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b210-13\">A. On there? Sometimes the\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b210-14\">[Counsel for Mr. Prince]: I would object, Your Honor. Can we approach?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b210-16\">THE COURT: Sure.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b210-17\">(Bench conference follows:)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b210-18\">[Counsel for Mr. Prince]: Your Honor, <em>I would note an objection. It </em>seems apparent that [the State] is qualifying <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>Mr. Stafford as an expert in this case. She\u2019s asking for him to draw conclusions. I don\u2019t know what his testimony is to proffer or what evidence was recovered from the scene. But <em>at this point, </em>she\u2019s asking questions outside of what I believe are expert boundaries in regards to ammunition and markings as such on the bullets.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b211-5\">[Counsel for the State]: Your Honor, it\u2019s all contained within the police report. The types of ammunition, how the ammunition is observed to be\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b211-6\">[Counsel for the State]: We\u2019ll move on, but we feel it\u2019s relevant.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b211-7\">(Emphases added.) Later in his testimony, Detective Stafford revisited the live round:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b211-8\">[Counsel for the State]: Okay. Detective Stafford, very briefly, <em>what does a misfire mean?</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b211-9\">A. <em>It means you pull the trigger and a round doesn\u2019t go off. </em>It could be attributable to a number of things, either the primer that\u2019s in the base of the cartridge might be bad and just doesn\u2019t go off. It can also be [attributed] to a malfunction of the firearm. Sometimes if you\u2019ve got like a dirty firing pin channel, the firing pin will come forward far enough to actually strike\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b211-10\">[Counsel for Mr. Prince]: Objection, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b211-11\">THE COURT: Same basis?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b211-12\">[Counsel for Mr. Prince]: Same basis, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b211-13\">THE COURT: Overruled.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b211-14\">(Emphasis added.) Detective Stafford went on to provide further detail regarding the officers\u2019 investigation of the scene.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-15\">Before Officer Costello testified, counsel for Mr. Prince objected to admission of the photographs of Ms. Garbe\u2019s car that showed the trajectory rods the officer had placed in the bullet holes. According to his counsel, \u201cthe trajectory is all speculation in terms of the path of the bullet and whatnot.\u201d Counsel for the State responded that the testimony was <em>not </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>expert testimony, and specifically that Officer Costello would testify only to fact information about the rods\u2019 placement:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A9m\">what these yellow rods are and what they\u2019re used for. And that they placed them to follow the path that the bullet took through the car. And that it ended, went through the bumper here and ended on that metal place.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b212-4\">And again, he\u2019s not testifying as an expert.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-5\">The Court ultimately determined that the placement of the rods was not a subject of expert testimony, and clarified the universe of appropriate testimony from Officer Costello:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b212-6\">THE COURT: But this doesn\u2019t require expert testimony. The testimony will be that they looked at the car. That there was a hole in the roof. That they put these rods through the hole. That it came out inside the car. There was a hole in the back seat. They put the rod through that. It went all the way through.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b212-7\">The testimony will be that they didn\u2019t make these holes. They didn\u2019t drill them in there.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b212-8\">THE COURT: But you have to stay away from ... any sort of technical language as regards to ... trajectory and that sort of thing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b212-9\">THE COURT: Now, counsel [for Mr. Prince], for the record <em>you obviously need to make your objection at the point that they are offered.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b212-10\">[Counsel for Mr. Prince]: Yes, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b212-11\">THE COURT: But I will overrule the objection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b212-12\">[Counsel for Mr. Prince]: Yes, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b212-13\">THE COURT: <em>But you need to make a good record.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"ANo\">(Emphasis added; omitting interjections from State\u2019s counsel.)</p>\n<p id=\"b212-14\">Officer Costello testified that he examined Ms. Garbe\u2019s car at the vehicle processing facility and performed a \u201creconstruction\u201d analysis, explaining\u2014again without objection from Mr. Prince\u2019s counsel\u2014what that meant:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b213-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>A. Meaning basically I wanted to or attempted to show trajectory or the path that was taken by a suspected bullet through the vehicle.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b213-5\">Q. And do you use any tools to do that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b213-6\">A. Yes, trajectory rods.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b213-7\">Q. What is that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b213-8\">A. So they\u2019re basically just standard rods that you kind of place through holes or in this case suspected bullet holes to show the directionality of travel, the path of travel.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b213-9\">Q. I\u2019m going to show you what\u2019s been marked as State\u2019s [Exhibits, the photographs]. Can you identify those?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b213-10\">A. Yes, I can.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b213-11\">Q. And what are they?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b213-12\">A. Those are photographs that I took on that day.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b213-13\">Q Generally, what are they of?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b213-14\">A. Of the trajectory rods that I spoke of, just now.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b213-15\">Q. And the trajectory rods that are in those photographs, did you place them where they are in those pictures?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b213-16\">A. I did. Yes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b213-17\">After the State moved the photographs into evidence, counsel for Mr. Prince objected <em>for the first time. </em>The court overruled his objection and Officer Costello proceeded to explain how he placed each trajectory rod through a suspected bullet hole\u2014first through the roof of the car, next through the driver\u2019s headrest, next through the rear seat on the driver\u2019s side, and finally through the rear of the trunk and the interior bumper of the vehicle. Again, this testimony came in without objection from counsel for Mr. Prince <em>until </em>the State sought to move the <em>photographs </em>into evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-18\">After the close of the State\u2019s case, Mr. Prince moved for a judgment of acquittal that the court denied. He then rested without testifying or putting on any evidence. The jury convicted Mr. Prince of all charges, and after a sentence review hearing, the court imposed a sentence of life with all <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>but 25 years suspended on the conviction for attempted first-degree murder, and concurrent sentences on the remaining counts. He was committed to Patuxent Institute, ordered to serve five years of supervised probation on release, and was to have no contact with Ms. Garbe. He filed a timely appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-5\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b214-6\">Mr. Prince argues on appeal that the trial court should not have permitted Detective Stafford and Officer Costello to testify as lay witnesses regarding information that was properly the subject of expert testimony.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> We take each officer\u2019s testimony in turn, but before reaching that question, we address as to each the State\u2019s argument (with which we agree) that Mr. Prince\u2019s counsel failed to lodge timely objections to the testimony. As to Mr. Prince\u2019s <em>second </em>claim, that he was entitled to a continuance, we conclude that because one expert had already determined he was competent to stand trial, and in light of the timing of his request, the trial court properly exercised its discretion not to allow him another opportunity, literally on the eve of trial, to try to rebut that finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-7\">A. The Trial Court Properly Admitted The Testimony Of Detective Stafford And Officer Costello.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-8\">We start by clarifying the issues the two law enforcement witnesses have in common and how they differ. Mr. Prince claims that both officers inappropriately testified as experts, and that the \u201ccumulative prejudicial effect\u201d of their testimony <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>requires reversal. A close reading of the transcript and the parties\u2019 briefs reveals, though, that the State <em>really </em>isn\u2019t contesting the characterization of Detective Stafford\u2019s testimony as expert testimony and that Officer Costello didn\u2019t offer expert testimony at all. And in any event, we agree with the State that these objections were not preserved as to <em>either </em>witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-5\">1. Detective Stafford</p>\n<p id=\"b215-6\">Mr. Prince argues that Detective Stafford\u2019s testimony about the alleged misfire was expert testimony and \u201cshould not have been admitted over [djefense [cjounsel\u2019s objections.\u201d According to Mr. Prince, these objections were \u201crepeated\u201d throughout the State\u2019s direct and redirect examinations of Detective Stafford. The State views the transcript differently, arguing that Mr. Prince did not preserve the question of its admission for review given the timing of his objections and, to the extent he did, its admission was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-7\">We assume without deciding that the testimony constituted expert testimony, but we agree with the State that Mr. Prince failed to object to the testimony in a timely manner at trial, and therefore failed to preserve these arguments. Moreover, the evidence showed not just the misfire but that Mr. Prince affirmatively fired a second bullet which, combined with Ms. Garbe\u2019s testimony that Mr. Prince took aim directly at her and the remaining evidence the State introduced at trial, rendered harmless the admission of any testimony relating to the misfire.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-8\"><em>First, </em>Mr. Prince\u2019s characterization of his counsel\u2019s objections does not square with the trial transcript. Although counsel did object on occasion, the objections were sufficiently delayed that they did not preserve his objections regarding the expert (or not) character of Detective Stafford\u2019s testimony. Maryland Rule 4-323(a) states that \u201c[a]n objection to the admission of evidence shall be made <em>at the time the evidence is offered </em>or as soon thereafter as the grounds for objection become apparent.\u201d (Emphasis added.) We agree with Mr. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>Prince that there is no bright-line rule to determine when an objection should be made. <em>See Holmes v. State, </em>63 Md.App. 159, 164, 492 A.2d 351 (1985). But the objection must come quickly enough to allow the trial court to prevent mistakes or cure them in real time:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b216-5\">The requirement of a <em>contemporaneous objection </em>is a necessary and salutary one, designed to assure both fairness and efficiency in the conduct of trials. A party cannot be permitted to sit back and allow the opposing party to establish its case, or any part of its case, through unchallenged evidence and then, when it may be too late for the opposing party to recover, to seek to strike the evidence. The \u201csporting theory\u201d of trial does not go that far.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b216-6\"><em>Perry v. State, </em>357 Md. 37, 77, 741 A.2d 1162 (1999) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b216-7\">Here, counsel did \u201csit back\u201d until it was too late. When Detective Stafford was called to testify, counsel let things go on for quite some time before he lodged any objections relating to the expert character of the testimony. He did not object when the State first called the detective to the stand, throughout the entirety of his qualifications (including his familiarity with firearms), or during his testimony about the investigation of this incident until after the State\u2019s question about the \u201cgreen stuff.\u201d By then, Detective Stafford was well into and then <em>well past </em>his testimony relating to the misfire, and the objection came too late to preserve the issue for appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-8\">Indeed, counsel for the State even signaled, wittingly or not, that the detective\u2019s testimony could require greater than a layperson\u2019s knowledge. After he described the ammunition as a \u201c7.62 NATO full metal jacket round, standard military loading,\u201d counsel stated <em>\u201cYou say that like we all know.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) Detective Stafford responded with further detail about the markings and explained that the \u201cdimple\u201d in the middle of the primer indicated a misfire. Mr. Prince\u2019s counsel objected only <em>after </em>the State had moved on to ask about the green discoloration on the live round, and even then <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>objected only to the pending question about the \u201cgreen stuff.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> At that time the court neither sustained nor overruled the objection, and the State simply \u201cmoved on.\u201d Counsel for Mr. Prince did not ask for any curative instruction or a ruling on the admission of Detective Stafford\u2019s testimony. And when counsel objected several pages later to Detective Stafford\u2019s testimony about the misfire (and then in the course of his answer, not when the State asked the question, \u201cwhat does a misfire mean\u201d), that area had already been covered and admitted on direct. By then, the claimed \u201cdamage\u201d had already been done\u2014that is, the State\u2019s question about the misfire simply repeated a question that had already been asked and answered without objection, rendering the testimony cumulative in either event. <em>Dove v. State, </em>415 Md. 727, 743-44, 4 A.3d 976 (2010) (\u201c[Cumulative evidence tends to prove the same point as other evidence presented during the trial\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b217-5\">Counsel did not follow the requirements of Rule 4-323 or the rationale behind <em>Perry </em>by waiting until the misfire was out of the bag, so to speak. The timing of his objections also undercuts Mr. Prince\u2019s argument that the State thwarted one purpose of discovery\u2014\u201cto avoid surprise at trial and to give the defendant sufficient time to prepare a defense.\u201d <em>Hutchinson v. State, </em>406 Md. 219, 227, 958 A.2d 284 (2008). Although counsel argued in passing in his written Motion <em>in Limine </em>that he had been deprived of the opportunity to get experts in opposition to the State\u2019s (\u201cCounsel for [Mr. Prince] has looked into obtaining an expert in ballistics ... but has not been able to do so due to the late notice.\u201d), his counsel made <em>no </em>such argument at the hearing. Instead, he withdrew his categorical objection to Officer Costello\u2019s testimony as moot and failed to press the court for a ruling as to Detective Stafford.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number><em>Second, </em>even if we were to conclude that the court erred in overruling the belated objection, the error was harmless. This case stands in stark contrast to <em>Ragland v. State, </em>385 Md. 706, 870 A.2d 609 (2005), in which the trial court allowed police officers to testify as lay witnesses about their conclusions that the defendant was engaged in a drug deal.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The Court of Appeals concluded that the trial court\u2019s error was not harmless because the State had relied heavily on the officers\u2019 testimony and the remainder of the case was correspondingly weak:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b218-5\">The primary witness against Ragland was ... an impeached witness, a participant in the alleged crime, and a witness testifying pursuant to a plea agreement with a promised benefit from the State. The remaining evidence was circumstantial, and depended upon an inference that [that witness] had obtained his piece of crack cocaine from [Rag-land]. To support this inference, the State relied in large part on the police officers\u2019 opinion testimony that the events [in question] had constituted a drug transaction. Under these circumstances, we cannot say beyond a reasonable doubt that this testimony did not contribute to the verdict.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A5e\"><em>Id. </em>at 726-27, 870 A.2d 609.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-6\">Here, we find beyond a reasonable doubt that this testimony could not have influenced the jury\u2019s verdict. <em>See Dionas v. State, </em>436 Md. 97, 108, 80 A.3d 1058 (2013) (noting that \u201c[b]ecause a criminal conviction must be based upon proof beyond a reasonable doubt in order to satisfy the constitutional requirements of due process, \u2018an appellate court should not arrive at a conclusion about the impact of an error upon a jury verdict with any less degree of certainty\u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>Dorsey v. State, </em>276 Md. 638, 659, 350 A.2d 665 (1976))). The State introduced abundant evidence that Mr. Prince acted with the intent to kill Ms. Garbe. He sent numerous texts to Ms. Garbe in the time preceding the incident that showed his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>escalating emotional state. He vandalized her car, showing a propensity to violence. Physical evidence in his room reflected that he planned the attack ahead of time. And\u2014most damning of all\u2014the misfire was not the shot that counted or that established Mr. Prince\u2019s intent. Ms. Garbe specifically testified that she saw Mr. Prince <em>aiming right at her </em>as the next bullet went into and through her car, intentional conduct that by itself qualified as behavior that could support a conviction for attempted first-degree murder. <em>Compare People v. Lamprey, </em>79 Ill.App.3d 1065, 35 Ill.Dec. 126, 398 N.E.2d 1076, 1079-80 (1979) (permitting a conviction for attempted murder to stand in the face of evidence of two misfires alone, without the firing of an actual shot). In this case, Mr. Prince did not shoot blindly in the air or even fire a warning shot. With or without any misfire, the undisputed evidence at trial established that he crouched <em>seven to eight feet from his victim, </em>aimed the rifle directly at her, and fired a shot directly into her car. We are comfortable that, in light of the totality of the evidence presented (and not presented) at trial, the testimony about the misfire could not have affected the jury\u2019s decision to convict.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-5\">2. Officer Costello</p>\n<p id=\"b219-6\">Mr. Prince challenges the admission of Officer Costello\u2019s testimony about the trajectory rods, again, he says, \u201c[ojver [djefense [cjounsel\u2019s repeated objections.\u201d He claims that Officer Costello gave expert testimony that was self-contradictory and confused the jury, rather than assisting it, and that the error was not harmless.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> As above, we begin by address<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>ing the State\u2019s argument that Mr. Prince failed to preserve his objections, and again we find that he did not preserve them, even after the court specifically reminded him to make any objections when the testimony was offered. We also hold that the court properly admitted Officer Costello\u2019s testimony as that of a lay witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-4\"><em>First, </em>as to the timing of Mr. Prince\u2019s objections, counsel engaged in a lengthy colloquy with the trial court in which the court ultimately held that Officer Costello could testify as a lay witness\u2014this after counsel for Mr. Prince <em>withdrew </em>the Motion <em>in Limine </em>as moot at the hearing the morning of trial. The court made clear to the State that it could not get into \u201ctechnical language\u201d or opinions regarding the bullet\u2019s trajectory. The court then warned counsel for Mr. Prince, \u201cyou need to make a good record.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b220-5\">Officer Costello then testified at length about his reconstruction with <em>no </em>objection from Mr. Prince\u2019s counsel. He explained his process for placing the trajectory rods and where each rod appeared in the car, drawing objections from counsel only later, when the State attempted to move the photographs into evidence. This objection, seemingly only to the photographs in any event, failed to heed the court\u2019s prior admonition that counsel make the appropriate objection when the testimony was offered.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-6\"><em>Second, </em>even though it wasn\u2019t preserved, we feel compelled to address the question Mr. Prince presses on appeal, <em>i.e., </em>whether the trial court improperly permitted Officer Costello to testify as a lay witness. We review that decision for an abuse of discretion: the decision as to whether to require a witness to testify as an expert \u201c \u2018is a matter largely within the discretion of the trial court, and its action in admitting or excluding such testimony will seldom constitute a ground for reversal.\u2019 \u201d <em>Oken v. State, </em>327 Md. 628, 659, 612 A.2d 258 (1992) (quoting <em>Stebbing v. State, </em>299 Md. 331, 350, 473 A.2d 903 (1984)); <em>Whittington v. State, </em>147 Md.App. 496, 539, 809 A.2d 721 (2002). Maryland Rule 5-701 governs admissibility of lay witness testimony:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b221-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>If the witness is not testifying as an expert, the witness\u2019s testimony in the form of opinions or inferences is limited to those opinions or inferences which are (1) rationally based on the perception of the witness and (2) helpful to a clear understanding of the witness\u2019s testimony or the determination of a fact in issue.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b221-5\">Md. Rule 5-701. Expert testimony, on the other hand, is governed by Rule 5-702, which lists specific factors that the trial court must examine in order to determine its admissibility:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b221-6\">Expert testimony may be admitted, in the form of an opinion or otherwise, if the court determines that the testimony will assist the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue. In making that determination, the court shall determine (1) whether the witness is qualified as an expert by knowledge, skill, experience, training, or education, (2) the appropriateness of the expert testimony on the particular subject, and (3) whether a sufficient factual basis exists to support the expert testimony.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b221-7\">Md. Rule 5-702.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-8\">In <em>Ragland, </em>the Court of Appeals reviewed both these rules under the then-existing standard and concluded it was appropriate to prohibit admission as \u201clay opinion\u201d testimony that is based on \u201cspecialized knowledge, skill, experience, training or education.\u201d 385 Md. at 725, 870 A.2d 609. The officers had testified at trial that they observed the defendant engaging in what they believed to be a drug transaction. <em>Id. </em>at 709-10, 870 A.2d 609. One of the officers testified that \u201cin his opinion\u201d he saw a drug transaction taking place; the State, while claiming he was not testifying as an expert, explained that the officer brought \u201cspecial knowledge about drug deals\u201d to the table. <em>Id. </em>at 726, 870 A.2d 609. The officer himself stated that his opinion was \u201cbased\u201d in part on his prior experience in a narcotics unit and his involvement in over 200 drug arrests. <em>Id. </em>The Court recognized that \u201c[t]he connection between the officers\u2019 training and experience on the one hand, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>and their opinions on the other, was made explicit by the prosecutor\u2019s questioning,\u201d and the reliance on the officer\u2019s expertise meant that his testimony was improperly admitted as lay testimony. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b222-4\">The witness in <em>Ragland </em>presented testimony that indisputably was grounded in his expert knowledge and experience\u2014 he relied specifically on his training to determine the drug transaction was taking place and interpreted the incident <em>subjectively </em>as he saw it unfold. As the Court described the facts, it was dark, none of the officers could see the face of the defendant or the items the parties exchanged, <em>id. </em>at 709-10, 870 A.2d 609, and the officers were required to base their conclusions on their training and experience in light of the \u201cnumerous possible explanations for the events\u201d of that evening. <em>Id. </em>at 726, 870 A.2d 609; <em>see also People v. Stewart, </em>55 P.3d 107 (Colo.2002) <em>(en banc). </em>So too in <em>Stewart, </em>in which the Supreme Court of Colorado held that an officer\u2019s testimony constituted expert testimony when he testified to an accident reconstruction that he performed based on witness testimony, and in which he interpreted skid marks at the scene. 55 P.3d at 122. Although the officer\u2019s testimony about his <em>observations </em>of the crime scene and his investigation of the incident were <em>proper </em>areas of lay testimony, the Court held that \u201cit was <em>inappropriate </em>for the court to permit him to testify as a lay person about his <em>reconstruction </em>of the crime scene and his <em>deductions </em>about such matters as the vehicle\u2019s direction, position, and speed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 124 (emphasis added). This case is different\u2014as we discuss below, the process of sliding trajectory rods through existing bullet holes, taking photos of the result, and reporting his actions does not require expertise or analysis grounded on an officer\u2019s particular training or experience.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-5\">We also are not persuaded by <em>State v. Walters, </em>551 A.2d 15 (R.I.1988), or by the other cases Mr. Prince cites for the proposition that trajectory analysis can <em>only </em>be the subject of expert testimony. In Wafers, the Supreme Court of Rhode Island held that a police officer could not properly testify about the \u201ctrajectory check\u201d he performed on the victim\u2019s car <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>that, according to the prosecution, went to show that the defendant had assumed a \u201ccombat position\u201d directly in front of the vehicle as he shot at the victim. <em>Id. </em>at 17. The officer had testified that he <em>reconstructed </em>the path of the bullet by passing a piece of string starting at <em>approximately </em>the point where the bullet would have entered the victim\u2019s chest, passing it \u201cthrough the bullet hole near the inspection sticker on the passenger\u2019s side of the windshield,\u201d and then taking it out the right fender of the car. Based on that testimony, the officer <em>inferred </em>that further extension of the rope would \u201creach the approximate shoulder height of a man five-foot-eleven-inches <em>tall\u201d\u2014i.e., </em>the defendant. <em>Id. </em>The Court did <em>not </em>hold that the police officer was improperly permitted to testify, but that the trajectory check was unreliable:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b223-4\">Because this trajectory check lacked any scientific basis and because a jury might be inclined to give weight to the apparent opinion testimony of a seasoned and experienced police officer describing his investigative methods, we hold that its admission constituted reversible error.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b223-5\"><em>Id. </em>And although the court clarified that the testimony would have been confusing to the jury if it had been permitted under the guise of lay witness testimony (simply placing \u201cunnecessary and irrelevant evidence\u201d before the jury, <em>id. </em>at 18), the <em>Walters </em>Court premised its holding on the <em>unreliable nature </em>of the police officer\u2019s testimony, which rested on his subjective opinion about where the bullet hit the victim and his approximation of where further extension of the rope would lead. We have no such unreliable testimony here, just the factual and objective placement of trajectory rods in holes.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-6\">The mere fact that a witness is a law enforcement officer does not automatically transform his testimony into expert testimony. In <em>In re: Ondrel M., </em>173 Md.App. 223, 918 A.2d 543 (2007), we considered whether a police officer could testify that he knew the smell emanating from the car of a juvenile (ultimately adjudged a delinquent) was marijuana, even though the officer had not been qualified or admitted as an expert. <em>Id. </em>at 243, 918 A.2d 543. This presented a question of first impression, and we looked to a Texas case in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>which the court reasoned that although the smell gave rise to the conclusion that a crime was being committed, that alone did not make the officer\u2019s testimony that of an \u201cexpert\u201d: \u201cIt does not take an expert to identify the smell of marihuana smoke. Testimony as to the identity of an odor is admissible in some instances even though the person testifying is not an expert.\u201d <em>Osbourn v. State, </em>92 S.W.3d 531, 537 (Tex.Crim.App. 2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b224-5\">We agreed in <em>Ondrel M. </em>that \u201c[n]o specialized knowledge or experience is required in order to be familiar with the smell of marijuana.\u201d 173 Md.App. at 243, 918 A.2d 543. We also noted that \u201c[i]n determining whether an opinion offered by a witness is lay opinion or expert testimony, it is not the status of the witness that is determinative. Rather, it is the nature of the testimony.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 244, 918 A.2d 543. We endorsed the Texas court\u2019s holding that \u201ctraining and experience\u201d do not automatically render an opinion an expert opinion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b224-6\">\u201cWhile [the police officer] may have had the potential to be qualified as an expert because she possessed knowledge, skill, experience and education, she was not testifying as an expert when she identified the marihuana. Rather, she was testifying based on her firsthand sensory experiences.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b224-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 244-45, 918 A.2d 543 (quoting <em>Osbourn, </em>92 S.W.3d at 538).</p>\n<p id=\"b224-8\">This distinction drives our conclusion that Officer Costello\u2019s testimony was appropriate testimony for a layman. A police officer who does nothing more than <em>observe </em>the path of the bullet and place trajectory rods (in the same manner as any layman could) need not qualify as an expert to describe that process. Officer Costello relied on his own observations and placed the rods into the holes made by the bullet fired by Mr. Prince. He conducted no experiments, made no attempts at reconstruction, and \u201cwas not conveying information that required a specialized or scientific knowledge to understand.\u201d <em>People v. Caldwell, </em>43 P.3d 663, 668 (Colo.App.2001). In <em>Caldwell, </em>police recovered two bullets from the vehicle, and an investigating officer testified regarding \u201cthe appearance and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>location of the two bullet holes on the outside of the car, the hole inside the car, and the dimpling of the metal inside the car. From his own observations and the use of a dowel and string, the technician testified that he tracked the paths of the two bullets.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 667. The Colorado Court of Appeals (affirming the conviction) held that although the officer had not been qualified as an expert, none of the information that he testified to required that he rely on his expertise\u2014and \u201che testified about the location of the bullet holes and the paths of the bullets that were evident from the photographs without any additional explanation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 668.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-4\">The same is true here. Even if Mr. Prince\u2019s counsel had objected in a timely manner, Officer Costello\u2019s opinion fell well within the universe of lay testimony, and the trial court properly admitted it.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-5\">B. The Trial Court Properly Denied Mr. Prince\u2019s Request for A Continuance.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-6\">Mr. Prince seems to suggest that the circuit court incorrectly interpreted the law as to whether he could offer the fact that he suffered from PTSD to negate the element of mental state. But the circuit court never got to that question\u2014the court denied him a continuance for the purpose of developing expert testimony about his mental state, and he appeals from <em>that </em>decision, not a decision on the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-7\">We review the decision to deny a motion for a continuance for an abuse of discretion: \u201c[t]o grant or deny a ... motion for continuance is \u2018in the sound discretion of the trial court.\u2019 \u201d <em>Serio v. Baystate Props., LLC, </em>209 Md.App. 545, 554, 60 A.3d 475 (2013) (quoting <em>Das v. Das, </em>133 Md.App. 1, 31, 754 A.2d 441 (2000)); <em>see also </em>Md. Rule 2-508. Unless we conclude that the trial court acted arbitrarily, we will not review its decision on appeal, <em>Das, </em>133 Md.App. at 16, 754 A.2d 441, and will reverse only in \u201cexceptional instances where there was prejudicial error.\u201d <em>Thanos v. Mitchell, </em>220 Md. 389, 392, 152 A.2d 833 (1959). We have described such an abuse of discretion as occurring only \u201c \u2018where no reasonable person <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>would take the view adopted by the [trial] court,\u2019 \u201d <em>North v. North, </em>102 Md.App. 1, 13, <em>648 </em>A.2d 1025 (1994) (quoting <em>In re: Marriage of Morse, </em>240 Ill.App.3d 296, 180 Ill.Dec. 563, 607 N.E.2d 632, 640 (1993)), or where the court acts \u201c \u2018without reference to any guiding rules or principles,\u2019 \u201d <em>id. </em>(quoting <em>Long John Silver\u2019s, Inc. v. Martinez, </em>850 S.W.2d 773, 775 (Tex.App.1993)). To establish an abuse of discretion by the trial court in denying a continuance, the requesting party must show:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-4\">(1) that he had a reasonable expectation of securing the evidence of the absent witness or witnesses within some reasonable time; (2) that the evidence was competent and material, and he believed that the ease could not be fairly tried without it; and (3) that he had made diligent and proper efforts to secure the evidence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b226-5\"><em>Smith v. State, </em>103 Md.App. 310, 323, 653 A.2d 526 (1995) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b226-6\">We find no abuse of discretion here. <em>First, </em>Mr. Prince offered no information on which the circuit court could have based a \u201creasonable expectation\u201d that admissible or relevant evidence would be secured; at most, he offered a hope. As Dr. Fields herself put it, \u201cthere are <em>reasons to believe </em>that [Mr. Prince] suffers from Dissociative episodes, particularly when stressed in interpersonal relationships.\u201d (Emphasis added.) But with nothing more to connect that possibility to the incident in question, her general assertion did not compel the circuit court to find that she would reach a meaningful opinion at all, much less \u201cwithin some reasonable time.\u201d <em>Second, </em>Dr. Fields offered no \u201ccompetent and material\u201d evidence\u2014again, only a prospect that she might be able to tie Mr. Prince\u2019s previously diagnosed PTSD to the crime at issue. <em>Finally, </em>the circuit court did not err in finding that Mr. Prince\u2019s efforts did not constitute \u201cdiligent and proper efforts to secure the evidence\u201d within the meaning of that phrase under <em>Smith. </em>Mr. Prince was diagnosed at Perkins in January 2011. Dr. Fields did not complete her preliminary diagnosis until fourteen months later, on March 11, 2012, and then it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>took another twelve days before that preliminary opinion was provided to the State, on the Friday afternoon before the Monday of trial. The court would have been within its discretion either way, but we see no basis on this record to second-guess the court\u2019s thorough and well-thought-out explanation.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-5\">JUDGMENTS OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR MONTGOMERY COUNTY AFFIRMED.
