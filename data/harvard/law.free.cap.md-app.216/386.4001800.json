Azizolah Abrishamian appeals a jury\u2019s verdict in the Circuit Court for Montgomery County finding that he breached his contract with appellee Washington Medical Group, P.C. (\u201cWMG\u201d) to pay bills for medical treatment WMG provided to him after the accident. Mr. Abrishamian opposed WMG\u2019s claims by arguing that his treating physician at WMG, Pedro Macedo, M.D., refused to honor an agreement to testify as an expert on his behalf in the post-accident personal injury lawsuit. Mr. Abrishamian interpreted this refusal as relieving him of his obligation to pay WMG\u2019s bills, but WMG disagreed and sued to recover the unpaid balance. Mr. Abrishamian counterclaimed for fraud and breach of contract, and after some fairly complicated (but not really complex) pre-trial wrangling, a jury returned a verdict in favor of WMG. Mr. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>Abrishamian challenges a number of the circuit court\u2019s procedural and evidentiary decisions, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-4\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b416-5\">Mr. Abrishamian suffered a head injury in his auto accident, and his physician referred him to WMG for treatment. At his first visit to WMG, Mr. Abrishamian signed an Authorization and Assignment Agreement (the \u201cA <em>&amp; </em>A\u201d), in which he agreed to pay WMG\u2019s medical bills out of the proceeds of any settlement or judgment he might recover from the lawsuit. Mr. Abrishamian recovered $30,000 in that suit, but never paid any of those proceeds to WMG. Instead, according to WMG, Mr. Abrishamian \u201cfiled an interpleader action in the Circuit Court to dispute the amounts owed to his medical providers.\u201d (The record does not contain any of the pleadings or other documents from that litigation.)</p>\n<p id=\"b416-6\">On January 11, 2010, WMG filed suit in the District Court for Montgomery County to enforce the A &amp; A, seeking to recover unpaid medical bills totaling $11,510.00, plus interest and attorneys\u2019 fees. On November 21, 2011, after discovering that it had received payments shortly after the accident from Mr. Abrishamian\u2019s Personal Insurance Protection policy (\u201cPIP\u201d) that it mistakenly had failed to apply to Mr. Abrishamian\u2019s account, WMG refiled its complaint and reduced the amount in dispute to $4,810.00. For his part, Mr. Abrishamian contends that WMG harbored an ulterior fraudulent motive for filing its initial complaint, and characterizes the trial court\u2019s (pretty routine) decision to allow WMG to refile the complaint in dramatic terms:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b416-7\">[WMG] knowingly and deliberately made the false representation that I owed [WMG] $11,510.00, which I did not. Not only had [WMG] sued me for this crafted amount they had also sued Mr. Edward J. Brown, a fellow bar member, whose only misfortune was that he was my attorney in a different case. After transferring the above-mentioned case to the Circuit Court ... [WMG] quickly changed course, confessed to the Circuit Court Judge ... that the $11,510.00 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>was indeed a false amount and pled for their complaint to be dismissed, which it was. [The trial court] penalized [WMG] by directing [it] to pay all court costs.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b417-4\">After WMG refiled the case in district court, it attempted repeatedly, without success, to serve Mr. Abrishamian and his counsel, Edward Brown. On May 16, 2011, the court entered an order allowing alternative service, and on June 13, 2011, denied Mr. Brown\u2019s motion to reconsider that order. The court entered an Affidavit Judgment against Mr. Abrishamian on August 4, 2011, and mailed a Notice of Judgment on August 18, 2011. He claims not to have received either (although he does not argue that the court mailed any documents to the incorrect address). Nevertheless, on September 2, 2011, in a classic failure to communicate,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Mr. Abrishamian filed <em>pro se </em>a Motion to Vacate the Affidavit Judgment <em>on the same day </em>that Mr. Brown\u2019s office filed a Motion to Vacate the Affidavit Judgment on his behalf (the latter also included a \u201crequest for sanctions\u201d). Both Mr. Abrishamian\u2019s Motion and counsel\u2019s Motion accused WMG of fraud; Mr. Abrishamian\u2019s Motion professed indignation at the notion that anyone might think that Mr. Brown\u2019s office represented him.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b418-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>The court vacated the Affidavit Judgment on November 14, 2011, and on December 12, 2011, Mr. Abrishamian filed a Counterclaim, also in district court. The Counterclaim alleged that WMG, through Dr. Macedo, had received payments from him to testify in the underlying personal injury litigation, but refused to do so. According to the Counterclaim, Dr. Mace-do\u2019s refusal to testify rendered Mr. Abrishamian \u201cunable to present $10,510.00 in medical bills and proof of injury\u201d at trial (impliedly because the refusal came too late for Mr. Abrishamian to find or subpoena another witness to authenticate the bills). Mr. Abrishamian also alleged that Dr. Macedo had offered to tamper with a diagnostic study to make it show results more likely to yield a verdict in his favor at trial. Perhaps more importantly for our purposes, the Counterclaim also included a demand for a jury trial, which caused the case to be transferred to the Circuit Court for Montgomery County-</p>\n<p id=\"b418-4\">On January 25, 2012, Mr. Abrishamian filed a Motion for Order of Default (the \u201cDefault Motion\u201d) in the circuit court on the ground that WMG had not filed an Answer to the Counterclaim. On January 30, 2012, the court denied what it called <em>\u201cPlaintiffs </em>Motion for Default\u201d (emphasis added), reasoning that <em>Mr. Abrishamian </em>had already filed an Answer (in the \u201cOrder Denying Default\u201d). The circuit court apparently mistook the Motion for Default as filed by <em>WMG, </em>and, we suspect, denied the motion based on Mr. Abrishamian\u2019s answer to the <em>original </em>Complaint. We discuss this order in greater detail below.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b419-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>On January 31, 2012, WMG filed an Opposition to the Motion for Default (the \u201cOpposition to Default Motion\u201d) (it presumably had not seen the court\u2019s order <em>denying </em>the Default Motion), along with an Answer to the Counterclaim. A brief respite of filings followed (and no request from Mr. Abrishamian for a clarification of the Order Denying Default). Then, on February 28, 2012, WMG moved to disqualify Mr. Brown pursuant to Maryland Rule 2-504 and Maryland Lawyer\u2019s Rule of Professional Conduct Rule 3.7 (the \u201cMotion to Disqualify\u201d). WMG argued that the core dispute in the case\u2014 whether Dr. Macedo agreed to serve as an expert witness\u2014 centered around a conversation between Dr. Macedo and Mr. Brown about whether Dr. Macedo had agreed unequivocally to testify. The court granted the Motion to Disqualify in an Order, dated March 29, 2012 (the \u201cDisqualification Order\u201d), that stated \u201cthat Edward J. Brown, Esquire, is DISQUALIFIED as counsel/attorney of record for [Mr. Abrishamian] in the above-captioned case.\u201d Mr. Brown viewed the Order as less than a total bar, however; a month later, on April 30, 2012, WMG moved to strike a notice of deposition (the \u201cMotion to Strike Macedo Deposition\u201d), that Mr. Brown had signed as counsel for Mr. Abrishamian and that purported to note Dr. Macedo\u2019s deposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-4\">After receiving the Motion to Strike Macedo Deposition, and at the request of WMG\u2019s counsel, the circuit court judge (not the one who ultimately presided at trial) called the parties in and held a hearing. The judge did not see the ambiguity that Mr. Brown had seen in his Disqualification Order:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b419-5\">THE COURT: What about my order is not clear?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b419-6\">MR. BROWN: Your honor\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b419-7\">THE COURT: You don\u2019t have to agree with it, but\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b419-8\">MR. BROWN: Right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b419-9\">THE COURT:\u2014it says you\u2019re out of the case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b419-10\">MR. BROWN: Well, I don\u2019t think it does say that, your honor, and I heard\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b419-11\">THE COURT: Great.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b419-12\">MR. BROWN: Okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b420-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>THE COURT: You\u2019re out of the case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b420-4\">MR. BROWN: Well\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b420-5\">THE COURT: Do not do anything else as a lawyer in the case. My order said you are disqualified\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b420-6\">MR. BROWN: Okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b420-7\">THE COURT:\u2014from acting as counsel in the case. You act as counsel at your peril. I don\u2019t want to pick up the phone. MR. BROWN: May I just\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b420-8\">THE COURT: Please.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b420-9\">MR. BROWN: Can\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b420-10\">THE COURT: No, you\u2019re out. You don\u2019t like it, take an appeal\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b420-11\">MR. BROWN: I\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b420-12\">THE COURT: When it\u2019s appealable.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b420-13\">MR. BROWN: Okay, but can I just make a quick record, your honor, because\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b420-14\">THE COURT: No. I\u2019m going to actually deny you that. I signed the order. It says what it says. It is not vague. It is not ambiguous. Close the record. You can\u2014the record will reflect, I\u2019m denying the right to argue <em>ad nauseam </em>and going over the same thing. If you act as a lawyer in the case again, I will seek guidance from the administrative judge. I don\u2019t want to do that. Thank you. You\u2019re done. MR. BROWN: May I cite one case?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b420-15\">THE COURT: No.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b420-16\">The docket entry characterizes the court\u2019s ruling as a \u201cpartial\u201d grant of the Motion to Strike Macedo Deposition, and the record contains no other reference to the remaining requests in that motion. On May 7, 2012, Mr. Abrishamian moved to reconsider what he referred to as the \u201cMay 3, 2012 Order\u201d (the \u201cMotion for Reconsideration\u201d). But that \u201corder,\u201d which issued from the bench, simply clarified the scope of the Disqualification Order that the court issued on March 29, 2012. Mr. Abrishamian argued in the Motion for Reconsideration that the scope of the Court\u2019s ruling improperly barred Mr. Brown from serving as counsel in the <em>entire </em>case in the circuit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>court, when he believed it should have only barred him from serving as counsel at trial. The court denied the Motion for Reconsideration on June 5, 2012.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-4\">Over the next several months, the parties filed various motions to quash, motions for postponement, and motions for attorneys\u2019 fees. And perhaps not surprisingly, efforts at alternative dispute resolution met with no success.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-5\">Prior to trial, WMG moved <em>in limine </em>to exclude any testimony by Mr. Abrishamian regarding his allegation in the Counterclaim that Dr. Macedo offered to \u201cenhance\u201d a brain imaging study. The court granted the motion \u201cwithout prejudice,\u201d leaving open the possibility that Mr. Abrishamian could seek to introduce the testimony if the issue came up again once trial was underway. The court reasoned that even if it were true, the claim alleged a \u201cprior bad act\u201d that Maryland Rule 5-404 would exclude. The court also found that the substance of the conversation was not relevant:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b421-6\">It strikes me that it is a prior bad act, wrongful conduct that did not actually induce your client to act. And it strikes me\u2014again, it\u2019s been in a vacuum, <em>because we\u2019re not in the midst of the trial. This is partly why I\u2019m saying you can raise it at an appropriate time outside the jury, with notice to us at the bench. </em>That strikes me that the prejudicial impact of that would be significant and heavily outweigh any probative value, since <em>I don\u2019t find that it has probative value.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b421-7\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b421-8\">Mr. Abrishamian filed several other pre-trial motions as well, including a motion asking the court to take judicial notice, under Maryland Rule 5-201, of a number of \u201cfacts\u201d that we list here, as he phrased them:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b421-9\">1) Dr. Wells\u2019 bills were admitted in the tort trial after Dr. Wells appeared, and laid the required foundation via his testimony;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b421-10\">2) Dr. Ammerman\u2019s bills were admitted in the tort trial after Dr. Ammerman appeared via video, and laid the required foundation via his testimony.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b422-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>3) Dr. Dombrowski\u2019s bills were admitted in the tort trial after Dr. Dombrowski laid the required foundation via his testimony;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b422-4\">4) Defendants WMG and [Dr.] Macedo [actually Plaintiff/Counter-Defendants] maintained their first lawsuit against [Mr. Abrishamian] for more than four months after receipt of actual notice that the allege [sic] amount sought was false. See Exhibit A. [Exhibit A is the 15-page Answers to Interrogatories that WMG filed in discovery.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b422-5\">5) That, at the time of the institution of the first lawsuit, had the amount which [WMG and Dr. Macedo] ultimately admitted was at issue been the amount sought, the case would have been a small claims action, could' not have been moved to the Circuit Court for Montgomery County, and no discovery could have occurred.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b422-6\">6) The Law Office of Edward J. Brown did not institute the tort lawsuit, as sworn in Defendant\u2019s Affidavit.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b422-7\">7) In WMG\u2019s s[sic] Answer to Interrogatory No. 3 in District Court, its representative, A. Bocian, admits that it was only possible that she, WMG\u2019s secretary, spoke to Defendant Brown (\u201cI spoke to Brown\u2019s office and possibly Brown himself.\u201d). <em>See </em>Plaintiffs Answer to Interrogatory No. 3, Ex.A. Bocian in her Motion for Summary Judgment Affidavit (Circuit Court 1), testifies under penalties of perjury that she spoke to Defendant Brown\u2014not a \u201conly possible\u201d [sic] anymore, but now an unconditional, unequivocal, unqualified assertion that she herself spoke to attorney Brown.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b422-8\">8) a) Defendant [actually Plaintiff] WMG, in Answer to Interrogatories, swore under penalties of perjury that it was only AFTER Brown signed the A &amp; A that the 11/10/2009 conversation with Dr. Macedo could, and did, go forward. <em>See </em>WMG\u2019s Answer to Interrogatory No.3, Ex.A.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b422-9\">b) It is undisputed that the date of the call was November 10, 2009.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b422-10\">c) Ms. Bocian in WMG\u2019s Affidavit in support of its Motion for Summary Judgment swore that Brown signed the A &amp; A on November 11, 2009. See Exhibit B.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b423-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>9) In the same Affidavit, Ms. Boeian swore that Brown was the person under whose \u201cadvisement (sic) that Abrishamian decided to pursue legal action against the third party tortfeasor\u201d. <em>See </em>Affidavit of Plaintiffs representative Boeian at paragraph 7, Ex. B. The Court docket discloses that the actions was instituted [sic] by completely unrelated counsel on May 29, 2008 (long before Brown\u2019s involvement over a year later\u2014the Md. Judiciary Website identifies the date of Brown\u2019s appearance as June 26, 2009).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b423-4\">10) The applicable confidentiality provisions of Federal law (HIPPA) [sic].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b423-5\">In denying the motion, the court noted that Mr. Abrishamian had not offered the documents from other cases themselves, but had asked the court to endorse his descriptions, and the court \u201cdeclin[ed] to take judicial notice of something that\u2019s no longer in the court record.\u201d At the same time, WMG told the court that it would seek attorneys\u2019 fees and prejudgment interest from the court if it prevailed, not from the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-6\">The case was tried to a jury on February 11-12, 2013. The jury returned a verdict in favor of WMG for $2,900.00. On April 18, 2013, the court granted WMG\u2019s petition for attorneys\u2019 fees in the amount of $965.70, and interest in the amount of $2,262.00.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-7\">Mr. Abrishamian filed a timely notice of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-8\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b423-9\">Mr. Abrishamian\u2019s list of appellate issues includes nearly every pre-trial decision the circuit court made.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> At the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>threshold, he argues that the Clerk of the Circuit Court erred in failing to enter a default and that that error alone entitles him to victory. From there, he challenges the circuit court\u2019s decision to disqualify his counsel (who, with our permission, briefed and argued the appeal), a variety of evidentiary rulings, and the court\u2019s decisions regarding interest and attorneys\u2019 fees. After sifting through the rhetoric and overstated allegations of fraud, we find no errors.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-4\">A. The Circuit Court Did Not \u201cErr in Failing To Enter An Order Of Default Against WMG.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b424-5\">Maryland Rule 2-613 provides that \u201c[i]f the time for pleading has expired and as provided by these rules, the court, on written request of the plaintiff, shall enter an order of default.\u201d Md. Rule 2\u2014613(b). The Rule then requires the Clerk to issue a notice of default to the defendant, who may file a motion within thirty days asking the court to vacate the order. Md. Rule 2-613(c). The motion to vacate must \u201cstate the reasons for the failure to plead and the legal and factual basis for the defense to the claim.\u201d Md. Rule 2-613(d). Importantly, and in light of the overarching preference that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>judgments reflect the merits of a dispute rather than procedural \u201cgotcha\u201d victories, the court <em>must </em>vacate the default if it \u201cfinds that there is a substantial and sufficient basis for an actual controversy as to the merits of the action and that it is equitable to excuse the failure to plead.\u201d Md. Rule 2-613(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b425-4\">Mr. Abrishamian contends that the circuit court was <em>required </em>to enter an order of default against WMG on his Counterclaim (there is no issue of default regarding WMG\u2019s claims against him, so nothing in this section relates at all to the jury verdict or ensuing judgment) thirty days after he filed the Default Motion. He is right on that discrete point. From there, though, he contends that judgment in his favor would have followed inexorably from an order of default. That leap in logic encounters insurmountable hurdles.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-5\">Had the Clerk entered an order of default, the next step would not have been a judgment on the Counterclaim, but notice to WMG and a thirty-day opportunity to file a motion to vacate the entry of default. And it seems to follow, based on the actual progression of events, that WMG would have filed such a motion, made the arguments it raised (successfully) in the Opposition to Default Motion, and that Mr. Abrishamian would have opposed such a motion with the arguments it made in the Default Motion. Put another way, it is clear that WMG would not have conceded the merits of the Counterclaim (because it fought them), and the circuit court in fact considered and decided the same issues and arguments an order of default would have placed before it, even if somewhat later in the life of the case. Faced with the same questions, albeit on an inverted posture, we are comfortable that the circuit court would have vacated an order of default under Rule 2-613(c), just as it declined to impose a default later, and that the Clerk\u2019s ministerial error did not prejudice Mr. Abrishamian.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-6\">Although Mr. Abrishamian argues that we must review the Order Denying Default <em>de novo, </em>we are persuaded that the more appropriate standard is the one we apply when default has been entered and the circuit court is asked to vacate it. Under those circumstances, the court has broad discretion, which \u201c \u2018must be exercised liberally, lest technicali<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>ty triumph over justice.\u2019 \u201d <em>Holly Hall Publ\u2019ns, Inc. v. Cnty. Banking &amp; Trust Co., </em>147 Md.App. 251, 262, 807 A.2d 1201 (2002) (quoting <em>Royal Ins. Co. of America v. Miles &amp; Stockbridge, P.C., </em>133 F.Supp.2d 747, 768 (D.Md.2001)). We reviewed the standard in detail in <em>Holly Hall, </em>where the trial court refused to vacate an entry of default. Although the trial court in that case entered default against a defendant in an original claim and not a counterclaim, the circumstances otherwise were similar\u2014the complaint related to previously filed actions, counsel for the parties had a tense working relationship, and the parties already were litigating a separate but related action. <em>Id. </em>at 254, 807 A.2d 1201. Counsel had an answer prepared, but, as he explained in a motion to strike the order of default, he held the answer while the parties discussed the possibility of settlement, then mistakenly failed to file it when the parties broke off those discussions. <em>Id. </em>at 255-56, 807 A.2d 1201. The court declined to grant the defendant\u2019s motion to strike the entry of default, a decision the defendant appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-4\">We discussed both facets of Rule 2-613(e) in <em>Holly Hall. First, </em>we addressed the requirement that a party show a \u201csubstantial and sufficient basis for a controversy as to the merits,\u201d and explained that \u201c[a] conelusory statement that merely tracks the language of the rule is insufficient.\u201d <em>Holly Hall, </em>147 Md.App. at 260, 807 A.2d 1201. <em>Second, </em>we examined in depth the Rule\u2019s requirement that the court consider whether \u201cit is equitable to excuse the failure to plead,\u201d noting at the outset the \u201cbroad general discretion\u201d of the trial court and the purpose of the rule in Maryland, which is \u201cnot punitive in nature.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 261-62, 807 A.2d 1201. We emphasized that the goal of the rule is \u201cto ensure that justice is done[, which] requires consideration of all relevant circumstances in any given case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 265, 807 A.2d 1201. We noted further that \u201c[technicality, while important, should not be elevated to an exalted status.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 266, 807 A.2d 1201. And we ultimately held that the trial court abused its discretion when it denied the motion to vacate, because the defendant had demonstrated the \u201cbasis for an actual controversy,\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number><em>id. </em>at 260, 807 A.2d 1201, and counsel\u2019s failure to file the answer came not from any ill-will or contumacious behavior, but from inadvertence. <em>Id. </em>at 267, 807 A.2d 1201. We added too that the motion to vacate came right after entry of the Order, so \u201cthere was no continuing pattern of neglect,\u201d nor any suggestion of harm to the appellee. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b427-4\">In this case, we recognize that the Opposition to Default Motion didn\u2019t address whether WMG had a meritorious defense. But technically it didn\u2019t have to, because it wasn\u2019t styled as a Rule 2-613 motion in the first place\u2014WMG wasn\u2019t aware that the court had issued the Order Denying Default, so it opposed the Default Motion generally rather than addressing the specific requirements under Rule 2-613(c). But as we look back at the circuit court record, the answer to the question of whether WMG had a meritorious defense is obvious\u2014WMG prevailed at trial when the court granted its motion to dismiss.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b427-5\">As to the <em>second </em>prong of the <em>Holly Hall </em>analysis, WMG\u2019s explanation for failing to answer tracks the argument that succeeded in <em>Holly Hall. </em>WMG\u2019s original attorney had left his law firm in August 2011, when Mr. Abrishamian filed the Counterclaim, and through inadvertence (or at worst, benign neglect), the answer to the Counterclaim slipped through the cracks. But WMG opposed the Default Motion within six days of filing (even though it had already been denied), within two months after Mr. Abrishamian filed the Counterclaim, and filed its Answer the same day.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-6\"><em>Finally, </em>we disagree that Mr. Abrishamian suffered any harm from the court\u2019s denial of the Default Motion. We see no connection between the Clerk\u2019s error in not entering an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>order of default on the counterclaim and the disqualification of his counsel, which arose (as we discuss in greater detail below) because counsel testified as part of Mr. Abrishamian\u2019s defenses to <em>WMG\u2019s claims </em>(and thus beyond the scope of the potential default). Rather than pressing for an order of default well before trial, Mr. Abrishamian proceeded with discovery and the remainder of the litigation, effectively acting as if the court had denied the Default Motion. We decline to reward Mr. Abrishamian\u2019s decision to wait until the morning of trial to demand a default, a litigation tactic that would subvert the recognized goal of \u201c \u2018conforming] to principles of justice and right\u2019 \u201d that we espoused in <em>Holly Hall, </em>147 Md.App. at 265, 807 A.2d 1201 (quoting <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>558 (7th ed. 1999)).</p>\n<p id=\"b428-4\">B. The Circuit Court Properly Disqualified Counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-5\">Mr. Abrishamian next challenges the trial court\u2019s decision to disqualify Mr. Brown as his counsel. He argues <em>first </em>that the court erred in failing to convene a hearing on the question, and contends that if it had, the court surely would have agreed with his position that Mr. Brown should continue as his counsel. <em>Second, </em>he claims that the scope of disqualification was too broad and that the court should have permitted Mr. Brown to continue representing him in non-trial matters. WMG counters that the circuit court properly disqualified Mr. Brown because his role as fact witness mandated his absence from the trial table\u2014and from all other aspects of the case, including discovery\u2014under Maryland Rules of Professional Conduct, Rule 3.7(a). Under these circumstances, we agree with WMG.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-6\">The governing ethical rule precludes lawyers from serving both as counsel and a witness in a case, save for three narrow circumstances:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b428-7\">(a) A lawyer shall not act as advocate at a trial in which the lawyer is likely to be a necessary witness unless:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b428-9\">(1) the testimony relates to an uncontested issue;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b428-10\">(2) the testimony relates to the nature and value of legal services rendered in the case; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b429-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>(3) disqualification of the lawyer would work substantial hardship on the client.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b429-4\">Md. Rule 16-812, Rules of Prof. Conduct, Rule 3.7(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b429-5\">Mr. Brown argues that <em>State v. Goldsberry, </em>419 Md. 100, 18 A.3d 836 (2011), required the circuit court to hold \u201can evidentiary hearing ... if the Court was even contemplating granting the Motion [to Disqualify].\u201d We disagree. <em>First, Goldsberry </em>is a criminal case that turns on a Sixth Amendment deprivation that obviously is not at issue here. <em>See id. </em>at 132, 18 A.3d 836 (the trial court\u2019s \u201cfailure to develop a factual record ... denied Goldsberry his Sixth Amendment right to counsel of his choice.\u201d). Mr. Abrishamian enjoys no such constitutional right to counsel, and he suffered no Constitutional prejudice when the circuit court disqualified his counsel without a hearing.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b429-6\"><em>Second, </em>we do not see how Mr. Brown could have avoided disqualification in any event. His credibility has always been a core issue in this case: Mr. Abrishamian claimed out of the gate that Dr. Macedo lied <em>to Mr. Brown </em>about whether he planned to testify in Mr. Abrishamian\u2019s personal injury trial. Mr. Brown testified at trial about conversations he had not only with Mr. Abrishamian and Dr. Macedo, but also with Alex Bocian, who worked at Dr. Mace-do\u2019s office. Mr. Brown\u2019s substantive centrality to the issues in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>the case should have compelled him to back out at the beginning, and the timing of the Motion to Disqualify doesn\u2019t really matter. <em>See Klupt v. Krongard, </em>126 Md.App. 179, 207, 728 A.2d 727 (1999) (\u201cWhen the attorney in question is so clearly aware before the fact of the potential conflict between his roles as advocate and witness, then the scrutiny usually applied to an opposing party\u2019s motion for disqualification is unnecessary, and the burden shifts to the attorney in question.\u201d). Moreover, Mr. Abrishamian had more than enough time before trial to secure other counsel, and he did so.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-4\"><em>Last, </em>we disagree with Mr. Abrishamian\u2019s assertion that Mr. Brown should have been permitted to participate in all stages of the litigation other than the trial. He over-reads a passing footnote in <em>Klupt, </em>in which we affirmed the trial court\u2019s disqualification of the appellant\u2019s counsel even as the appellant offered to waive the conflict that formed the basis of the court\u2019s decision. The appellant in <em>Klupt </em>raised the question of whether the attorney who had been disqualified should have participated in that pending <em>appeal. </em>We explained that \u201c[t]he [trial] court\u2019s order of disqualification is not explicit on the question of whether [counsel] was disqualified from representing the appellants at trial or from any <em>further participation </em>in this case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 211 n. 6, 728 A.2d 727 (emphasis added). That\u2019s all we said: the footnote did not suggest that any sort of piecemeal disqualification at the trial level would have been appropriate, but simply compared involvement at the <em>trial </em>level with involvement at the <em>appellate </em>level. Disqualification of counsel at the trial level can extend to any aspect of the litigation the circuit court deems appropriate under the circumstances, and the circuit court properly prohibited Mr. Brown\u2019s involvement in discovery as well as at trial in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-5\">C. The Circuit Court Properly Excluded Mr. Abrishamian\u2019s Testimony About The \u201cEnhanced\u201d EMG Study.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-6\">Mr. Abrishamian <em>next </em>argues that the trial court should have permitted him to testify that Dr. Macedo offered to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>\u201cenhance\u201d a diagnostic imaging test, ostensibly to increase his potential damages in the auto tort trial. WMG responds that the testimony would have admitted inadmissible information about alleged prior bad acts, and the trial court also barred it (properly) as unduly prejudicial. The trial court granted WMG\u2019s Motion <em>in Limine, </em>but did so <em>without prejudice </em>and on several different grounds:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b431-4\">It strikes me that it is a prior bad act, wrongful conduct that did not actually induce your client to act. And it strikes me\u2014again, it\u2019s been in a vacuum, because we\u2019re not in the midst of the trial. This is partly why I\u2019m saying <em>you can raise it at an appropriate time outside the jury, </em>with notice to us at the bench. That strikes me that the prejudicial impact of that would be significant and heavily outweigh any probative value, since <em>I don\u2019t find that it has probative value. </em>Now, in the context of the trial, maybe it will have a different appearance. But right now, I think it\u2019s just a prior bad act. It\u2019s generally not admissible and doesn\u2019t fit within [an] exception to that rule. <em>So, I guess you could say the motion\u2019s granted without prejudice.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b431-5\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b431-6\">We review a trial court\u2019s decision to admit or exclude evidence based on relevance for an abuse of discretion. <em>Fenner v. State, </em>381 Md. 1, 25, 846 A.2d 1020 (2004). We disagree with WMG in one regard: Dr. Macedo\u2019s offer (assuming its truth for present purposes only, and making no judgment as to its veracity) could not have been precluded as a prior bad act, because Rule 5-404(b) relates only to criminal proceedings. <em>See Ruffin Hotel Corp. of Md. v. Gasper, </em>418 Md. 594, 625, 17 A.3d 676 (2011). But the trial court acted within its discretion in deeming the testimony both irrelevant and prejudicial, and we affirm its decision on that ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-7\">Maryland Rule 5-401 defines relevant evidence as evidence \u201chaving any tendency to make the existence of any fact that is of consequence to the determination of the action more probable or less probable than it would be without the evidence.\u201d Md. Rule 5-401. Rule 5-403 permits exclusion of some rele<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>vant evidence nonetheless: \u201cAlthough relevant, evidence may be excluded if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, or misleading the jury, or by considerations of undue delay, waste of time, or needless presentation of cumulative evidence.\u201d Md. Rule 5^03.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-4\"><em>First, </em>we agree with the trial court\u2019s assessment that this evidence was not relevant. It had nothing to do with the contract claim or the disputes of fact between Mr. Abrishamian and Dr. Macedo. Even though Mr. Abrishamian perceived a \u201cpattern\u201d of fraud on Dr. Macedo\u2019s part, absolutely no evidence supported that claim. <em>Second, </em>even if relevant, evidence about this conversation would have caused prejudice that outweighed any probative value. <em>See Alban v. Fiels, </em>210 Md.App. 1, 23, 61 A.3d 867 (2013) (where plaintiff offered testimony in hit-and-run trial that defendant drove off smirking after causing the accident, trial court \u201ccould have reasonably concluded that the introduction of the disputed testimony would have been unduly prejudicial\u201d). We also note that Mr. Abrishamian cited no cases relating to the relevance/probative value argument, which consumes all of two paragraphs in his brief. <em>Van Meter v. State, </em>30 Md.App. 406, 408, 352 A.2d 850 (1976) (\u201c[Ijissues can be waived for failure to comply with the procedural requirements to preserve the right of appellate review.\u201d)</p>\n<p id=\"b432-5\"><em>Finally, </em>although WMG didn\u2019t raise this argument, we note that Mr. Abrishamian waived his right to press this issue on appeal. When he first argued this point in the course of WMG\u2019s Motion <em>in Limine, </em>the court ruled <em>in favor of WMG, without prejudice, </em>and told counsel for Mr. Abrishamian that he could raise the matter during trial \u201cat an appropriate time outside the jury.\u201d But through the course of Mr. Abrishamian\u2019s testimony, when counsel had the chance to elicit testimony from him about the alleged conversation, counsel <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>never did so, leaving us with no decision of the circuit court to review.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-4\">D. The Circuit Court Properly Awarded Pre-Judgment Interest And Attorneys\u2019 Fees After Entry Of The Verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-5\">Mr. Abrishamian appears to make the same argument with respect to both pre-judgment interest and attorneys\u2019 fees, <em>ie., </em>that the court should not have permitted WMG to submit them after the jury reached its verdict. The issues are separate, but the outcome is the same for both: Mr. Abrishamian failed to preserve the issue for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-6\">Prior to trial, counsel for WMG told the court that he wanted to petition the court for attorneys\u2019 fees and prejudgment interest <em>after </em>the jury returned a verdict. He explained his rationale about the pre-judgment interest:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Apq\">[COUNSEL FOR WMG]: There\u2019s\u2014the contract between Mr. Abrishamian and [WMG] provides for interest on the unpaid bill. We have a calculation. I\u2019d rather just let you rule on that, assuming that we prevail, afterwards, rather than give it to the jury to try to figure out\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b433-7\">THE COURT: Isn\u2019t pre-judgment interest a discretionary matter with the court?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b433-8\">[COUNSEL FOR MR. ABRISHAMIAN]: Yes. I mean, I was\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b433-9\">THE COURT: Opposed to a jury?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b433-10\">[COUNSEL FOR MR. ABRISHAMIAN]:\u2014it\u2014I wasn\u2019t raising that, but I believe it\u2019s 2 percent in the contract.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AbR\">[COUNSEL FOR WMG]: Yeah. So I think I should present that to you as well, after the trial\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b433-11\">THE COURT: All right. I\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b433-12\">[COUNSEL FOR WMG]:\u2014assuming\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b433-13\">THE COURT: <em>I would think so, too, unless you want to argue that point.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b433-14\">[COUNSEL FOR MR. ABRISHAMIAN]: <em>No.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b433-15\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b433-16\">In the course of the court\u2019s review of proposed jury instructions and the verdict sheet, both the court and counsel for WMG referred to the fact that attorneys\u2019 fees would not be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>addressed in the verdict sheet. (From the trial court: \u201cAttorneys\u2019 fees, damages is out.\u201d Then, from counsel for WMG: \u201c[W]e\u2019ve agreed already that we\u2019re going to submit the attorneys\u2019 fees to the court after trial anyway.\u201d) Counsel for Mr. Abrishamian said nothing at the time, and impliedly acceded in the court\u2019s treatment as to fees as well. <em>See Van Meter, </em>30 Md.App. at 408, 352 A.2d 850 (\u201c[Ijissues can be waived for failure to comply with the procedural requirements to preserve the right of appellate review.\u201d); <em>see also </em>Md. Rule 8-131(a) (\u201cOrdinarily, the appellate court will not decide any ... issue unless it plainly appears by the record to have been raised in or decided by the trial court.\u201d); <em>Halloran v. Montgomery Cnty. Dep\u2019t of Pub. Works, </em>185 Md.App. 171, 201, 968 A.2d 1104 (2009) (noting that Rule 8-131(a) \u201carises from the principle that \u2018[w]hen a party has the option either to object or not to object, his failure to exercise the option while it is still within the power of the trial court to correct the error is regarded as a waiver of it estopping him from obtaining a review of the point or question on appeal\u2019 \u201d) (quoting <em>Basoff v. State, </em>208 Md. 643, 650, 119 A.2d 917 (1956)).</p>\n<p id=\"b434-4\">E. The Trial Court Properly Declined To Take Judicial Notice Of The Information Mr. Abrishamian Submitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-5\">Mr. Abrishamian argues <em>last </em>that the circuit court should have taken judicial notice of certain information under Rule 5-201, which provides that upon a party\u2019s request, the court <em>must </em>take judicial notice of \u201cadjudicative facts.\u201d WMG argues that the court properly declined to take judicial notice because the \u201cfacts\u201d Mr. Abrishamian referred to were not contained in any court record and did not constitute \u201cadjudicative facts.\u201d We agree with WMG\u2014the trial court properly exercised its discretion not to take judicial notice of these non-adjudicative and highly disputed \u201cfacts.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b434-6\">Rule 5-201 describes the kinds of facts that properly are subject to judicial notice:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b435-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>A judicially noticed fact must be one not subject to reasonable dispute in that it is either (1) generally known within the territorial jurisdiction of the trial court or (2) capable of accurate and ready determination by resort to sources whose accuracy cannot reasonably be questioned.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b435-4\">Md. Rule 5-201. We review the trial court\u2019s decision under the \u201cclearly erroneous\u201d standard, keeping in mind \u201c[t]he principle that there is a legitimate range within which notice may be taken or declined and that there is efficacy in taking it, when appropriate.\u201d <em>Smith v. Hearst Corp., </em>48 Md.App. 135, 141, 426 A.2d 1 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b435-5\">Trial courts can take judicial notice of \u201cmatters of common knowledge or [those] capable of certain verification.\u201d <em>Faya v. Almaraz, </em>329 Md. 435, 444, 620 A.2d 327 (1993); <em>see also Dashiell v. Meeks, </em>396 Md. 149, 174-76, 913 A.2d 10 (2006) (holding that appellate court may take judicial notice of adjudicative facts at its discretion). We have distinguished \u201cadjudicative facts\u201d from \u201clegislative facts\u201d by defining the former as facts \u201c \u2018about the parties and their activities, businesses and properties. They usually answer the questions of who did what, where, when, how, why, with what motive or intent.\u2019 \u201d <em>Dashiell, </em>396 Md. at 175 n. 6, 913 A.2d 10 (quoting <em>Montgomery County v. Woodward &amp; Lothrop, Inc., </em>280 Md. 686, 376 A.2d 483 (1977)); <em>Irby v. State, </em>66 Md.App. 580, 586, 505 A.2d 552 (1986) (\u201cThe doctrine of judicial notice substitutes for formal proof of a fact \u2018when formal proof is clearly unnecessary to enhance [the accuracy of] the fact finding process.\u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>Hearst Corp., </em>48 Md.App. at 136, 426 A.2d 1)). Many different types of information can fall under the umbrella of judicial notice, most commonly public records such as court documents, <em>see Marks v. Criminal Injuries Comp. Bd., </em>196 Md.App. 37, 78, 7 A.3d 665 (2010), or facts that are widely known (often within the particular geographic area where a case is pending). <em>See, e.g., Dean v. State, </em>205 Md. 274, 280-81, 107 A.2d 88 (1954) (taking judicial notice that certain streets were within a particular city\u2019s borders, thus allowing a trial judge to determine that crimes were committed within the jurisdiction); <em>see also Hearst Corp., </em>48 Md.App. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>at 140-41, 426 A.2d 1 (permitting trial court to take judicial notice of the fact that a local newspaper was owned by a particular corporation). And the categories of adjudicative facts susceptible to judicial notice run the gamut, from public records, <em>see Marks, </em>196 Md.App. at 79 n. 7, 7 A.3d 665 (judicially noticing that the Administrative Office of the Courts makes Maryland Judiciary records available on the Judiciary\u2019s website), to medical, <em>see Schultz v. State, </em>106 Md.App. 145, 173, 664 A.2d 60 (1995) (taking judicial notice of reliability of ophthalmological test, if properly administered), to forensic, <em>see Eley v. State, </em>288 Md. 548, 553-54, 419 A.2d 384 (1980) (\u201cThis Court has taken judicial notice of the high degree of reliability accorded to [fingerprint] identification.\u201d), to geographic, <em>see Iozzi v. State, </em>224 Md. 42, 44, 166 A.2d 257 (1960) (\u201c[Geographical facts of a local nature may be judicially noticed by a trial court to establish venue. This is particularly true as to the location of towns within a particular county where the court sits.\u201d (citations omitted)), to behavioral. <em>See Pettit v. Erie Ins. Exch., </em>117 Md.App. 212, 228, 699 A.2d 550 (1997), <em>aff'd, </em>349 Md. 777, 709 A.2d 1287 (1998) (taking \u201cjudicial notice of the definition of pedophile provided in Diagnostic Statistical Manual IV (DSM-IV), a publication of the American Psychiatric Association\u201d (citations omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b436-4\">What unites these various classes of information is not so much their nature as public or widely-known, but more their nature as undisputed\u2014as one commentator has described it, falling into either the \u201ceverybody around here knows that\u201d category, or the \u201clook it up\u201d category. <em>See </em>Lynn McLain, Maryland Evidence, State &amp; Federal \u00a7 201:4(b)-(c), at 221, 237 (3rd ed. 2013). Put another way, \u201c[i]f there is no reason to waste time proving a fact, it can be \u2018judicially noted.\u2019 \u201d Joseph Murphy, Maryland Evidence Handbook \u00a7 1000, at 489 (4th ed. 2010). But the doctrine does not typically extend to facts relating <em>specifically </em>to the parties involved. <em>See, e.g., Walker v. D\u2019Alesandro, </em>212 Md. 163, 169, 129 A.2d 148 (1957) (finding error where trial court took judicial notice that defendant had taken certain actions in his official capacity as mayor of the City of Baltimore).</p>\n<p id=\"b437-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>Mr. Abrishamian\u2019s requests for judicial notice (which we reproduced above in Part I as he recounted them in his motion) all relate to facts still in dispute in this case:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b437-4\">\u2022 Mr. Abrishamian\u2019s medical bills (Dr. Wells, Dr. Ammerman, and Dr. Dombrowski);</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b437-5\">\u2022 The <em>nature of </em>pleadings and discovery responses in this case, both in the circuit court and in the district court below (for example, that WMG maintained its original lawsuit for more than four months after it realized that the $11,000 damages claim was \u201cfalse,\u201d and that if the proper amount had been pled the case would have remained in district court);</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b437-6\">\u2022 The truth <em>vel non </em>of certain facts in the litigation (for example, that WMG\u2019s employee Alex Bocian would have to have been the person there to speak with Mr. Brown about the litigation); and last,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b437-7\">\u2022 \u201cThe applicable confidentiality provisions of Federal law (HIPPA [sic]).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b437-8\">None of these categories describes information that a court could notice judicially. The parties conceivably could have stipulated to the authenticity of the documents in the <em>first </em>category (medical bills), although we don\u2019t mean to suggest WMG necessarily had to. The documents at issue, however, don\u2019t contain medical <em>facts </em>susceptible to judicial notice\u2014they are the medical bills that form the basis of WMG\u2019s claims in this case. <em>Compare Kassama v. Magat, </em>368 Md. 113, 119 n. 5, 792 A.2d 1102 (2002) (holding that the fact that the normal term of human pregnancy is 38 weeks was properly the subject of judicial notice).</p>\n<p id=\"b437-9\">As to the <em>second </em>category, we agree with the trial court that it could not take judicial notice of pleadings not in the record. <em>See In re Nathaniel A., </em>160 Md.App. 581, 598, 864 A.2d 1066 (2005) (holding that trial court properly took judicial notice of pleadings in prior CINA determination where the pleadings were entered into evidence at the later proceeding). <em>But see Cochran v. Griffith Energy Servs., Inc., </em>426 Md. 134, 145 n. 4, 43 A.3d 999 (2012) (taking judicial notice on appellate review <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>of the contents of filings in a prior lawsuit, based on the fact that both parties agreed at oral argument that they had relevance to the appeal, and the court concluded that a \u201cjust result\u201d would be reached by considering them). Moreover, Mr. Abrishamian wasn\u2019t simply asking the court to notice judicially the <em>existence </em>of the pleadings\u2014he wanted the court to assume the truth of the assertions within those pleadings. Noticing pleadings does <em>not </em>mean accepting what they say as true, only that they exist as public records. <em>See Lerner v. Lerner Corp., </em>132 Md.App. 32, 41, 750 A.2d 709 (2000) (taking judicial notice of an order and notice of judgment entered in the circuit court, but not, for example, of a party\u2019s offer to sell stock). The truth or falsity of the arguments remained for the court to decide.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-4\">In the <em>third </em>category, Mr. Abrishamian asked the court to notice facts that not only were in dispute, but that lay at the center of his claim. And for good measure, these disputed facts (like those in the first two categories) related specifically to this litigation and would not have been judicially noticed in the first instance. <em>See Walker, </em>212 Md. at 169, 129 A.2d 148 (permitting trial court to take judicial notice that the defendant <em>was </em>the Mayor of Baltimore City, but finding error in its taking judicial notice that he <em>was acting in his official capacity </em>with respect to the underlying claims).</p>\n<p id=\"b438-5\">Mr. Abrishamian\u2019s <em>last </em>request, that the trial court judicially notice \u201cHIPPA [sic] regulations,\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> could conceivably fall under Md.Code (2006, 2013 Repl. Vol.), \u00a7 10-501 of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article, which mandates that the courts \u201cshall take judicial notice of the ... statutes of every state, territory, and other jurisdiction of the United States.\u201d But he never invoked this statute as a basis to introduce the applicable regulations in the first place\u2014he asked the court generically to take notice of \u201c[t]he applicable confidentiality provisions of Federal law (HIPPA),\u201d with no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>useful citation to a particular provision or group of provisions. Moreover, he does not raise this provision again on appeal or argue that the court erred by declining to take judicial notice of it, and thus has waived the right to raise it on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-4\">JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR MONTGOMERY COUNTY AFFIRMED.

The pleading signed by Mr. Brown\u2019s associate claimed that WMG misrepresented that Mr. Brown and/or Mr. Abrishamian evaded service, argued that WMG\u2019s assertion \"must be viewed as knowingly false,\u201d alleged that the Motion contained \u201cincomplete and misleading representations\u201d that, combined with WMG\u2019s \"history of fraud,\u201d compelled the imposition of sanctions, and concluded that WMG had committed \"acts of breach and fraud.\u201d In his <em>pro se </em>motion, Mr. Abrishamian asserted that it was \"crystal clear\u201d that Mr. Brown was not representing him, and referred to WMG and its counsel's collective \u201cdeliberate and knowledgeable dissemination of falsehood\u201d to that effect, in spite of the fact that Mr. Brown filed the same motion on his behalf that very day. His motion also claims WMG and its counsel \"propagatfed] falsehoods\u201d about his evasion of service, and engaged in a \"deliberate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>campaign to dissemination [sic] false information\u201d about this evasion, citing also their collective attempts \"to again craftily exact money from me which I do not owe.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b418-6\">. The circuit court\u2019s confusion was understandable\u2014at this point, the parties were filing motions and proposed orders quickly and furiously. The Counterclaim itself seems to have caused confusion\u2014-within that document, Mr. Abrishamian refers to himself as the \"Plaintiff,\u201d the \"Counter Plaintiff,\u201d and the \"Defendant\u201d (and also refers to WMG as the \"Defendant,\u201d to add to the confusion).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b423-10\">. He presented to us the following questions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b423-11\">A. Did the circuit court err in failing to enter an order of default against [WMG], due to WMG\u2019s Failure to file a timely answer, which would have avoided the need for [Mr. Abrishamian's] counsel of choice to have been exposed to a motion to disqualify?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b423-12\">B. Did the circuit court err in ruling that [Mr. Abrishamian\u2019s] counsel of choice could not serve as counsel in non-trial matters, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>including hearings and discovery, and in preventing [Mr. Abrishamian] from performing discovery due to this erroneous? [sic]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AOR\">C. Did the circuit court err in disqualifying [Mr. Abrishamian\u2019s] counsel of choice <em>without a hearing, </em>and thus never evaluating the applicable factors, including waiver and the substantial hardship that recusal, particularly at the late stage the challenge was raised, would inflict upon [Mr. Abrishamian]?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ae5\">D. Did the circuit court err in applying a prior bad acts rationale in a civil case, and incorrectly excluded [sic] evidence that [Dr. Macedo] tampered with an imaging study taken of [Mr. Abrishamian]?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A5q\">E. Did the circuit court err in granting attorney\u2019s fees, as [WMG\u2019s] failure to petition for contract-based fees before judgment was entered terminated the claim?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AAr\">F. Did the circuit court err in assessing interest, as [WMG\u2019s] failure to petition for contract-based interest before judgment was entered terminated the claim, and given that the jury\u2019s award may have already included the interest?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AJTh\">G. Did the trial court err in not taking judicial notice of key facts from the first lawsuit, which prejudiced [Mr. Abrishamian] as this was the only way these facts could be presented!?]</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b427-7\">. Although Mr. Abrishamian attacks the lack of defenses WMG raised <em>at that time </em>and claims we can\u2019t rely on the fact that WMG ultimately prevailed on the Counterclaim, we decline to ignore reality. And in any event, Mr. Abrishamian conducted himself throughout the pre-trial phase of the case as if default had been denied\u2014he moved forward with discovery and trial and only raised the issue again on the morning of trial, when the court properly denied his motion for default based on WMG\u2019s filing of an answer and the fact that \u201cthe parties are aware that [WMG] is not admitting fraud.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b429-7\">. WMG filed the Motion to Disqualify on February 28, 2012, and Mr. Abrishamian opposed it on March 19, 2012. Even allowing for fifteen days to respond under Rule 2-311, and allowing for three days mailing under Rule l-203(c), it appears the Opposition was filed one day late. We don't rely on the untimeliness of Mr. Abrishamian\u2019s filing as a basis for our holding, however, because the trial court was correct on the merits. And although Mr. Abrishamian refers to the Motion for Reconsideration of the \"May 3 Order,\u201d he actually misunderstands that the March 29, 2012 Disqualification Order is what's at issue here; the court made abundantly clear from the bench on May 3 the scope of its <em>initial </em>March 29, 2012 Disqualification Order, but his Motion to Reconsider what he characterizes as a May 3 Order did not entitle him to a hearing or any further explanation from the trial judge. <em>Lowman v.
