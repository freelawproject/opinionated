Vol.) \u00a7 3-812 of the Courts <em>&amp; </em>Judicial Proceedings Article (\u201cCJP\u201d), is the court required to grant the motion when it finds that the parent has had his or her parental rights to other children involuntarily terminated?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b83-10\">For the reasons set forth below, we shall affirm the judgment of the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-11\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b83-12\">Ms. D. has a long history with BCDSS and the court system, involving each of her five children: Joshua, born June 19, 1991; India, born July 7, 1996; Linda, born July 21, 1999; Malachi, born June 11, 2007; and, Joy, born September 21, 2002. We previously set forth the background of Ms. D.\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>involvement with BCDSS in <em>In re Malachi D. and Joy D., </em>No. 3006, Sept. Term, 2010 (filed Sept. 20, 2011), an appeal involving the dismissal of children in need of assistance petitions (\u201cCINA\u201d)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> pertaining to Malachi and Joy.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-4\">On June 18, 1998, Ms. D. brought Joshua to Johns Hopkins Hospital and requested that he be evaluated and hospitalized. When the hospital staff informed her that Joshua did not require hospitalization, Ms. D. became so upset that the police were called, and she subsequently was hospitalized for psychiatric treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-5\">On August 6, 1998, with Ms. D.\u2019s consent, the Circuit Court for Baltimore City found Joshua and India to be CINA and removed them from Ms. D.\u2019s custody. The children were placed with their maternal grandparents. Ms. D. previously had expressed a desire to place the children for adoption, and she had only \u201csporadic\u201d contact with Joshua after the placement. Joshua, who has since turned 21 years old, was never reunified with Ms. D.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-6\">Ms. D.\u2019s parental rights with respect to India and Linda, who was found to be CINA on October 1,1999, were terminated on November 6, 2003, after a contested hearing.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Prior to the termination of Ms. D.\u2019s parental rights to India and Linda, Dr. Dale L. Peterson diagnosed Ms. D. with borderline personality disorder, a \u201cchronic and severe\u201d condition that results in \u201c Very, very fractured\u2019 \u201d interpersonal relationships and \u201c \u2018inappropriate displays of anger and affective instability,\u2019 including \u2018sudden fits of rage.\u2019 \u201d Dr. Peterson opined that Ms. D.\u2019s disorder made it \u201c \u2018highly unlikely that she could provide <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>an environment of adequate safety and emotional stability for her children.\u2019 \u201d Her \u201c \u2018unpredictability also affected her willingness to parent, and ... at times, she wanted to waive her parental rights.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b85-5\">In 2000, Ms. D. met Elliott D. He was abusive and forced her into sexual activity. Despite the abuse, Ms. D. married Elliott D. in 2002 when she was pregnant with Joy. Ms. D. believed that, by being married to Elliott D., it would be less likely that BCDSS would remove Joy from her care, as it had with her other children. Ms. D. and Elliott D. never lived together, and he contributed very little to Joy\u2019s care.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b85-6\">In June 2006, when Joy was three years old, Ms. D. took her to the emergency room at Johns Hopkins Hospital after Joy had fallen and injured her lip. While Ms. D. was registering Joy, she became hysterical and verbally abusive to Joy and the registration coordinator. A social worker who witnessed the incident took Ms. D. to a separate room. Once Ms. D. calmed down, she reported that she was a victim of domestic violence, and the incident with the registration process had triggered feelings \u201cof everyone treating her like she was nothing.\u201d Joy appeared to have \u201csome fear of her mother.\u201d Hospital staff provided Ms. D. with a number of referrals for support services, including the House of Ruth, BCDSS Adult and Family Support Unit, and Turnaround, a program that assists families and children who have witnessed violent acts. Ms. D., however, never enrolled Joy in mental health services.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-7\">Joy\u2019s first contact with BCDSS was in 2007. On May 29, 2007, BCDSS filed a Petition with Request for Shelter Care with regard to Joy. Shortly after Malachi\u2019s birth, on July 17, 2007, BCDSS initiated shelter care proceedings for him, as well. The juvenile court authorized Joy\u2019s placement in shelter care, but it denied the initial request for shelter care for Malachi, ordering instead that Ms. D. ensure that Malachi receive \u201c \u2018all necessary medical care\u2019 \u201d and cooperate with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>BCDSS and hospital staff. On October 5, 2007, the petitions were dismissed without prejudice at the request of BCDSS, following Ms. D.\u2019s compliance with the court\u2019s orders.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-5\">On March 13, 2009, while at a local hospital, Ms. D. was observed hitting twenty-one-month-old Malachi on his back. Someone contacted the police, and a child protective services report was filed. BCDSS concluded that there was no neglect, but based on Ms. D\u2019s statement to a social worker at the hospital that she was overwhelmed with the care of her children, BCDSS placed both Joy and Malachi in shelter care. At the shelter care hearing on March 16, 2009, the court ordered that Joy be kept in shelter care. The court denied shelter care for Malachi, but it issued an order controlling conduct, which specified that Ms. D. not use physical discipline against Malachi and permit announced and unannounced visits by BCDSS and the child\u2019s counsel. Joy subsequently was returned to Ms. D.\u2019s custody, but the order controlling conduct was continued.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-6\">On July 13, 2009, a BCDSS social worker made a visit to Ms. D.\u2019s home. While the social worker interviewed Joy, Ms. D. became very upset and stated, in front of Joy, that Joy was \u201c \u2018an evil devil.\u2019 \u201d Based on Ms. D.\u2019s statement and conduct, the children\u2019s counsel filed a motion for immediate review of the children\u2019s CINA petitions. Prior to that hearing, on August 31, 2009, BCDSS placed Joy and Malachi in the home of Charlene and Herbert K., after Ms. D. requested psychiatric hospitalization of Joy. On September 1, 2009, the juvenile court ordered that Joy and Malachi be placed in shelter care. Joy adjusted well to Mr. and Ms. K.\u2019s home, bonded with the family, and improved in all areas of development.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-7\">During a supervised visit in April 2010, after Joy referred to her foster mother as her mother, Ms. D. became verbally aggressive and threatened to kill the BCDSS family preservation worker, Chante Hoke-King. Joy was frightened and cried uncontrollably. The police had to be called to escort Joy, Malachi, and the foster parent away from the building.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>In May 2010, BCDSS developed a service agreement for Ms. D., offering mental health services and parenting classes, to try to work toward reunification. Ms. D. denied having mental health issues and declined both individual therapy and family counseling. She also missed many scheduled visits with the children. Ms. D.\u2019s desire to have Joy return home was \u201cinconsistent and when positive conditioned on evil spirits being out of Joy.\u201d Ms. D. referred to Joy as a \u201cdemon of hell,\u201d whom she did not \u201creally like,\u201d and she stated that Joy needs to be \u201cout [of] my house\u201d and \u201cshould be with her bipolar and abusive father instead and drive him crazy.\u201d She also sent approximately 2,000 e-mails to Ms. Hoke-King, protesting BCDSS\u2019 involvement in her life.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-5\">In July 2010, an adjudicatory hearing was held. The Master recommended dismissal of Malachi\u2019s petition and sustained certain allegations in Joy\u2019s petition. The Master recommended finding that Ms. D. had acted in ways that had caused Joy emotional harm, and she had been aggressive toward BCDSS workers, threatening to kill one of them in front of Joy. On October 20, 2010, the Master recommended that Joy be found a CI\u00d1A and committed to BCDSS. Ms. D. filed exceptions in Joy\u2019s case. On January 21, 2011, after a <em>de novo </em>hearing, the court dismissed the CINA petitions, and Joy and Malachi were returned to the care and custody of Ms. D.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b87-6\">On June 25, 2011, while the appeal was pending in this Court, Joy called 911 and reported that she was being abused; she requested BCDSS involvement. Joy told the responding police officers that her mother had hit her on her bottom.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b88-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>After the police left, Ms. D. took Joy to the emergency room at Johns Hopkins Hospital. She reported that Joy\u2019s alleged behavior was unmanageable, and she did not want Joy home with her. She stated that Joy needed to be returned to foster care because Ms. D. could not manage Joy\u2019s behavioral problems. Joy also reported to social worker Kathleen Orr that she wanted to return to her previous foster family. Even when she was informed that she might not be able to return to her previous foster family, she persisted in her desire to return to foster care.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-5\">After extensive discussion with hospital staff, Ms. D. determined that she would be able to safely manage Joy until Monday with the help of her fianc\u00e9, Henry E., who agreed to stay in the home and help her until Monday morning. Ms. D. did not report to hospital staff Joy\u2019s concerns about potential sexual abuse by Mr. E.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-6\">On June 28, 2011, Ms. D. again took Joy to the emergency room at Johns Hopkins Hospital and requested an emergency psychiatric evaluation. The hospital did not admit Joy. On June 29, 2011, Ms. D. took Joy to University of Maryland and reported that Joy required an emergency psychiatric evaluation for her \u201cbad behavior.\u201d When Ms. D. was informed that Joy would not be admitted, she became violent and verbally abusive. In an effort to calm Ms. D., the treatment team agreed to have Joy transferred to a pediatric clinic for evaluation. Ms. D.\u2019s aggressive behavior continued, however, and she threatened a social worker.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-7\">During the interview with a social worker, Ms. D. repeatedly called Joy a \u201cliar\u201d and a \u201chorrible child\u201d and loudly denigrated Joy in Joy\u2019s presence. Ms. D. became increasingly agitated and began making delusional statements. Joy and Malachi sat very close to one another on one chair, and Joy appeared to make herself as small as possible, getting closer and closer to Malachi, indicating in a soft voice, \u201cI don\u2019t like when mommy gets angry like this.\u201d The social worker concluded that Ms. D. needed a psychiatric evaluation in light of her \u201cobserved paranoid and irrational behavior,\u201d and that Joy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>\u201cwas not safe with her mother exhibiting these behaviors.\u201d BCDSS removed Joy, and on June 30, 2011, the juvenile court ordered the continuation of Joy\u2019s placement in shelter care. BCDSS was able to place Joy back into the K.\u2019s home. Joy has never returned to Ms. D.\u2019s home.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-5\">On June 25, 2011, Diana Wade<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> was assigned to work with the D. family. Initially, Ms. D. acknowledged Ms. Wade\u2019s efforts and reported that she had a good rapport with her. Ms. D. still insisted that Joy was a liar and the \u201cmajor problem [in] the case.\u201d She persisted in her belief that Joy was the \u201cdevil\u2019s child,\u201d and that the devil uses Joy. She thought that Joy needed an exorcism, stating that she wanted Joy returned to her only if Joy was \u201cassessed for possible possession.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b89-6\">On July 26, 2011, Ms. D. contacted BCDSS. She was extremely anxious and overwhelmed. A family preservation worker, Ravital Shalev, met with Ms. D. for a home safety assessment. Ms. D. reported that she was overwhelmed by Malachi and his emotional needs. She stated that she was extremely frustrated, and she asked that Malachi be removed from her care. Ms. D. was offered family preservation services, as well as mental health, parenting, counseling and financial assistance services, but she \u201cwanted none of it.\u201d The following day, BCDSS filed a petition for shelter care, and Malachi was removed from the home. Malachi was placed in the same home as Joy, first with the K.\u2019s, and then later with Ms. W.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b89-7\">In May 2012, a forensic psychiatrist, Ronald Means, completed psychiatric evaluations of Ms. D., Joy, and Malachi. Dr. Means concluded that Ms. D. has \u201csigns of mania with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>severe irritability and seemingly erratic behavior.\u201d She also has problems with anxiety and appeared \u201cseverely paranoid\u201d at times. Dr. Means diagnosed Ms. D. with Borderline Personality Disorder, which is a \u201cpervasive pattern of instability of interpersonal relationships, self-image, and emotions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b90-4\">Dr. Means found Joy to be well-adjusted despite her disrupted childhood. Joy advised Dr. Means that her foster home was a \u201cbetter, safer, nicer environment.\u201d With respect to visitation, Joy stated that she \u201csometimes\u201d enjoyed seeing her mother, but she did not want to live with her and would rather be adopted and communicate with Ms. D. through letters or e-mail. In describing Ms. D.\u2019s emotional responses, Joy stated: \u201cOne time she\u2019ll love you, and another time, she\u2019ll hate you. She yells and screams.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b90-5\">LaShaunna Lipscomb, a therapist at Neighbor to Family, told Dr. Means that Joy had done very well since being in foster care. She indicated that Joy \u201cwalks on eggshells\u201d during supervised visitation with Ms. D., and that Ms. D. is \u201cvery volatile\u201d and \u201cno one knows what sets her off.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b90-6\">Dr. Means concluded that Ms. D.\u2019s personality disorder had \u201cseverely affected her functioning throughout the years,\u201d and it had impacted her ability to parent her children. He stated that it was \u201cparticularly problematic that she remains ambivalent about whether she wants Joy to return to her care and only wants to accept her back under conditions that are unrealistic,\u201d such as having an exorcism and assessment for possession. Dr. Means opined that Ms. D. needed prolonged individual therapy and medications in order to \u201cbegin to demonstrate stability,\u201d but he noted that Ms. D. was \u201cnot invested in mental health treatment and does not believe in mental illness.\u201d Ms. D. also had \u201cno insight into her level of dysfunction and does not intend to participate in ongoing treatment.\u201d He concluded that Ms. D.\u2019s \u201cability to provide nurturance, supervision and adequate care for her children will continue to be significantly impacted by her severe personality disorder.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b91-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>In July 2012, the juvenile court held adjudicatory and disposition hearings for Joy and Malachi. The court conducted an <em>in camera </em>interview of Joy and Malachi, and found that, although they loved Ms. D., they both were \u201cvisibly afraid of Mother\u2019s anger and mood shifts and both wish to remain in the care of Ms. K.\u201d The court found Joy to be a CI\u00d1A and committed her to the custody of BCDSS. It found that BCDSS had made reasonable efforts to reunify Joy with Ms. D. by facilitating weekly visitations, making referrals, offering service agreements, maintaining contact with Ms. D., placing the children together, and ensuring the children\u2019s needs were met. Ms. D., however, had been uncooperative at times, and she had failed to appear for scheduled meetings, refused to allow BCDSS caseworkers to enter her home, failed to regularly visit with Joy, and failed to follow through with aftercare services for Joy. The court noted that Ms. D. had demonstrated \u201cfits of rage,\u201d and had not been amenable to treatment for her mental health disorders because she did not believe that there was \u201csuch thing as mental illness.\u201d The permanency plan was reunification.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-5\">On April 18, 2013, the court held a permanency planning review hearing. There was testimony regarding attempts to get counseling for Ms. D. She had been referred to Hebron House, a psychological therapeutic house providing counseling services, but Hebron House indicated that they could not help Ms. D. Ms. D. next sought mental health counseling at APEX, an outpatient mental health center, but it withdrew from services because of the \u201cdistraction of Mother\u2019s constant emails.\u201d Ms. D. indicated that she would not participate with BCDSS family involvement meetings.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-6\">Ms. D. had completed anger management classes and parenting classes. She had maintained contact with BCDSS through letter and by e-mail, as well as during her weekly visits with the children. Ms. D.\u2019s supervised visits were \u201cgenerally going well.\u201d Ms. Wade described one visitation, however, on February 26, 2013, when Ms. D. tried to give Malachi a time out for not wanting to look at a video. Malachi responded: \u201cDon\u2019t kill me.\u201d On another visit, Malachi was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>kicking and screaming because there was no computer mouse. Ms. D. became agitated and threatened to call the police. When Malachi continued to kick and cry, Ms. D. became increasingly agitated and displayed rage in front of the children. Ms. D. accused Ms. Wade of abusing her. Following the visit, Malachi had to be placed in respite care for two days. The court found that, although Ms. D. had completed anger management classes, these events showed that she had not overcome her severe mood swings and mental health disorder.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-5\">At the conclusion of the hearing, the court found, in pertinent part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b92-6\">Mother has previously indicated that she was overwhelmed by parenting [the children] when they were last removed\u2014 and Mother\u2019s testimony today indicates that she was similarly overwhelmed on 4/9/2013. The continued cycle of Mother\u2019s erratic and sometimes cycling rage behavior (leveled at various points at everyone involved in these proceedings\u2014and even to [the children]) is imminently dangerous to the emotional safety of the [children]\u2014[Malachi\u2019s] two days of respite care and previously regressive behaviors after visiting with Mother are strong and persuasive of this continuing risk to [the children\u2019s] safety raised by this record and recent events.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b92-7\">Mother has continued to devote considerable efforts to challenge her mental health diagnosis and indeed the existence of any mental health illness. Regardless of differences of opinion on the underlying issues, the [c]ourt continues in its finding that the emotional injury of Mother\u2019s cycling rage behavior, while perhaps improved in some small measure, remains at a level which is a real and serious threat to the emotional health and mental health of [the children]. Joy and Malachi deserve and need the stability of parenting that meets their emotional and developmental needs.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b92-8\">While Mother loves [the children] and has made significant efforts to comply with the court\u2019s orders and BCDSS service agreements; unfortunately, those efforts, both reasonable by BCDSS and those by Mother, have not made <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>Mother closer to the ability to parent [the children] than Mother was when [the children] were last removed upon Mother\u2019s admission that she was overwhelmed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b93-5\">It would be contrary to [the children\u2019s] welfare to return to the care of their Mother today: Mother\u2019s [erratic] and sometimes explosive rage is emotionally injurious to [the children] and the most recent occurrence of that behavior on 4/9/2013 establishes that Mother\u2019s mental health issues have not resolved to a point where [the children] can or should be in their best interest and [safety] be placed in Mother\u2019s care. The [c]ourt is also persuaded that [Joy] does not [presently] wish to return to Mother\u2019s care.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b93-6\">After finding that BCDSS had made reasonable efforts to achieve the permanency plan of reunification, the court changed the permanency plan to a concurrent plan of reunification and relative placement for custody and guardianship. It set the next hearing for July 9, 2013.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-7\">In May 2013, Ms. D. became unwilling to continue to work with Ms. Wade. She sent a series of e-mails to Ms. Wade stating that she was \u201celiminating\u201d her from the case and from supervising visits. She accused Ms. Wade of lying and \u201cfalse reporting,\u201d and she advised Ms. Wade not to contact her unless it was an emergency. She also accused Ms. Wade of making her physically ill, and she stated that she would file a police report against Ms. Wade if she received any certified mail from her. Ms. D. also threatened to \u201cpress criminal charges for harassment and assault.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b93-8\">On May 9, 2013, BCDSS filed a motion to waive the requirement that it continue to make reasonable efforts to reunify Joy and Malachi with Ms. D. The motion noted that Joy had been out of Ms. D\u2019s care continuously since June 30, 2011, Ms. D. had a long history of not being able to provide for her children, and on November 6, 2003, the court had involuntarily terminated her parental rights to Linda and India.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>BCDSS asserted that it had not sought a waiver previously because it was attempting to give Ms. D. another opportunity to address the reasons for the children\u2019s placement in BCDSS\u2019s care, and in deference to the court\u2019s decision to continue a plan of reunification. Ms. D., however, had demonstrated repeatedly that she had no understanding of her untreatable condition, which was \u201cimmune to intervention.\u201d BCDSS asserted that, in addition to the authority provided by statute, it was in the children\u2019s best interest that efforts for reunification cease, noting that Ms. D.\u2019s condition had not improved since 1998. Accordingly, BCDSS requested that the court waive the requirement that it make reasonable efforts at reunification, and it requested a permanency planning hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-5\">Ms. D. did not file a written response. Joy, through counsel, joined in BCDSS\u2019s request. She attached as exhibits Ms. D.\u2019s e-mails indicating that she no longer would work with Ms. Wade, which Joy noted would make it \u201cvirtually impossible\u201d and \u201cfutile\u201d \u201cfor BCDSS to continue to engage her in efforts toward reunification.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b94-6\">On May 30, 2013, the court heard argument on the motion. BCDSS presented evidence that Ms. D.\u2019s parental rights to two of her children had been terminated, and this was the third CINA petition involving Joy and Malaehi. Indeed, it asserted, this was the 40th hearing for Joy, who had been in the care of BCDSS for two years, and \u201c[a]t this point there is nothing else that we can do for this parent and we\u2019re asking you to waive reasonable efforts based on the statute.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b94-7\">Counsel for Joy noted that the court\u2019s April 18 order stated that Ms. D. still had \u201cerratic and explosive rage,\u201d which was a danger to the children, and Ms. D. was \u201cno closer to the ability to care for the children than she had been when the children were last removed.\u201d She also referred to the e-mails from Ms. D., indicating that Ms. D. was \u201cno longer allowing the [BCDSS] to work with her\u201d and was \u201cgoing to do her bonding with the children in some way that didn\u2019t include the workers or supervised visitation.\u201d On that basis, counsel stated that she did not believe that BCDSS could continue to make <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>reasonable efforts to reunify Ms. D. with Joy, and Joy\u2019s progression toward permanency should not be further delayed.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-5\">Ms. D.\u2019s counsel did not refute any of these arguments.

He argued that Ms. D.\u2019s social workers had \u201cbent over backwards\u201d for her, but she was no closer to reunification than she was when the children initially were sheltered.

That statute provides that a department of social services \u201cmay ask the court to find that reasonable efforts to reunify a child with the child\u2019s parent or guardian are not required\u201d if the department concludes that the parent has:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b97-6\">(1) Subjected the child to:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b97-7\">(i) Chronic abuse;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b97-8\">(ii) Chronic and life-threatening neglect;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b97-9\">(iii) Sexual abuse; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b97-10\">(iv) Torture;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b97-11\">(2) Been convicted, in any state or any court of the United States, of:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b97-13\">(i) A crime of violence against:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b97-14\">1.

It provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b98-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>If the court finds by clear and convincing evidence that any of the circumstances specified in subsection (b) of this section exists, the court <em>shall </em>waive the requirement that reasonable efforts be made to reunify the child with the child\u2019s parent or guardian.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b98-4\">(Emphasis added).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b98-5\">Ms. D. contends that the court erred in granting the motion by BCDSS to waive the requirement that it provide reunification services to her. She asserts that, pursuant to CJP \u00a7 3-812, the court must exercise discretion in waiving the right to reunification services, but the court here believed that it was required to grant the motion and did not exercise this discretion. Although she acknowledges that the statute uses the word \u201cshall,\u201d she asserts that interpreting the statute as mandating a waiver of reasonable efforts where a parent has had a prior involuntary termination of parental rights would \u201cnullify the court\u2019s obligation to consider what is in the child\u2019s best interests,\u201d and it would violate the parent\u2019s fundamental constitutional right to raise his or her children free from undue and unwarranted interference on the part of the State.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-6\">She further argues that, even if the record could be construed to suggest that the court did exercise discretion, it abused its discretion. This is so, she asserts, based on its finding at the previous review hearing that Ms. D. was in \u201csubstantial, if not total, compliance with her court-ordered services,\u201d noting that the existence of remaining \u201cproblems was not a sufficient basis to waive reasonable efforts.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b99-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>BCDSS contends that, pursuant to the plain language of CJP \u00a7 3-812(d), the court is <em>required </em>to grant a local department\u2019s motion to waive the obligation to make reasonable efforts to reunify a parent and a child when the court finds the existence of one of the circumstances in \u00a7 3-812(d), such as the involuntary loss of parental rights of a sibling child. It asserts that the legislative history, and the statutory purpose, i.e., to prevent children from languishing in foster care for years while local departments continue to make efforts to achieve reunification with hopelessly dysfunctional families, confirms this construction of CJP \u00a7 3-812. Alternatively, BCDSS asserts that, even if the court was required to exercise discretion, it properly did so, because there was overwhelming evidence to support the ruling, particularly Ms. D.\u2019s repeated failures to address the root causes of Joy\u2019s placement in foster care, her history of uncontrollable rages, and her refusal to cooperate with services.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-5\">With respect to Ms. D.\u2019s constitutional challenge, BCDSS argues that Ms. D. has waived this argument because she did not raise it below. In any event, it argues, a mandatory grant of a motion to waive the obligation to make reasonable efforts to reunify a parent with his or her child does not violate Ms. D.\u2019s fundamental constitutional rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-6\">Joy also contends that the court properly waived the obligation of BCDSS to continue to provide reunification services to Ms. D. She asserts that the court had ample evidence before it to support a waiver of reasonable efforts. Joy argues that where, as here, reunification services would be futile and the child\u2019s best interests require a realistic permanency plan, the local department is not required to continue to offer services.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-7\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-8\">Application of CJP \u00a7 3\u2014812(d)</p>\n<p id=\"b99-9\">The first question we must address is the meaning of the language in \u00a7 3-812(d), which requires that, upon a finding of the existence of a statutory waiver condition, the court \u201cshall <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>waive the requirement\u201d of reasonable efforts toward reunification. Specifically, we must determine whether \u00a7 3\u2014812(d) creates a mandatory obligation on the court to grant a local department\u2019s request to waive the obligation to make reasonable efforts to reunify a parent and a child when the court finds that one of the statutory waiver conditions exist.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-4\">In making that determination, we apply well-settled principles of statutory interpretation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b100-5\">In statutory interpretation, our primary goal is always to discern the legislative purpose, the ends to be accomplished, or the evils to be remedied by a particular provision, be it statutory, constitutional or part of the Rules. We begin our analysis by first looking to the normal, plain meaning of the language of the statute, reading the statute as a whole to ensure that no word, clause, sentence or phrase is rendered surplusage, superfluous, meaningless or nugatory. If the language of the statute is clear and unambiguous, we need not look beyond the statute\u2019s provisions and our analysis ends. If, however, the language is subject to more than one interpretation, it is ambiguous, and we endeavor to resolve that ambiguity by looking to the statute\u2019s legislative history, case law, statutory purpose, as well as the structure of the statute. When the statute is part of a larger statutory scheme, it is axiomatic that the language of a provision is not interpreted in isolation; rather, we analyze the statutory scheme as a whole considering the purpose, aim, or policy of the enacting body, and attempt to harmonize provisions dealing with the same subject so that each may be given effect.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b100-6\"><em>State v. Phillips, </em>210 Md.App. 239, 259-60, 63 A.3d 51 (2013) (quoting <em>Lowery v. State, </em>430 Md. 477, 490, 61 A.3d 794 (2013)).</p>\n<p id=\"b100-7\">In light of these principles, we start by looking to the language of the Act itself, which provides that, upon certain conditions, the court \u201cshall waive\u201d the obligation to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>provide reunification efforts.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The use of the word \u201cshall\u201d is significant; it \u201cordinarily indicates a mandatory intent, unless the context of the statute indicates otherwise.\u201d <em>Burch v.

Thus, pursuant to the plain language of the statute, upon a finding, by clear and convincing evidence, that the parent has involuntarily lost his or her rights to a sibling of the child, a court has a mandatory obligation to grant a motion filed by the local department to waive the obligation to continue to make reasonable efforts for reunification.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b101-5\">The legislative history of CJP \u00a7 3-812(d) supports the interpretation that the statute imposes a mandatory obligation on the court. In <em>In re James G., </em>178 Md.App. 543, 943 A.2d 53 (2008), we reviewed in depth the background regarding the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>\u201creasonable efforts\u201d requirement, and the significant changes made to federal law in 1997 based on concerns that children were lingering in foster homes for too long because agencies were \u201c \u2018engaged in excessive efforts to \u2018repair\u2019 hopelessly dysfunctional families\u2019 \u201d and were \u201c \u2018being reunited with parents when it was not safe to do so in the name of reasonable efforts.\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 575-76, 943 A.2d 53 (quoting Kathleen S. Bean, <em>Reasonable Efforts: What State Courts Think, </em>36 U. Tol. L.Rev. 321, 326 (2005)). The 1997 changes to federal law included a requirement that states, in order to receive federal subsidies, must provide for the waiver of the requirement that local departments make reasonable efforts to reunify the child with the parent under specified circumstances. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 671(a)(15)(D), Adoption and Safe Families Act of 1997 (\u201cAFSA\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b102-5\">In 1998, in response to the AFSA waiver requirements, the General Assembly passed House Bill 1093, which initially was codified at CJP \u00a7 3-812.1. <em>See </em>1998 Md. Laws, ch. 539. With respect to the court\u2019s obligation to waive the reasonable efforts requirement upon request, the initial bill contained the language \u201cshall,\u201d which was amended by the House Judiciary Committee to \u201cmay,\u201d but was changed again by the Conference Committee. The explanation for the change was to strike \u201cthe language in the [amended House] Bill that would have made it discretionary for a court to grant a waiver of the local department\u2019s obligation to provide reunification services if aggravated circumstances exist, and substitute[] language making it <em>mandatory </em>for a court to grant a waiver of these obligations under those circumstances.\u201d Conference Committee Report to HB 1093 at 1-2. In 2001, CJP \u00a7 3-812.1 was re-enacted as CJP \u00a7 3-812(d), with no change regarding the mandatory language. 2001 Md. Laws, ch. 415. The legislature\u2019s intent in this regard is clear.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-6\">Accordingly, we hold, pursuant to the plain language of the statute, as well as the legislative history, that the language of CJP \u00a7 3-812(d) is mandatory. When a local department requests the court to waive its obligation to continue reunifica<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>tion efforts, and the court finds, by clear and convincing evidence, that one of the statutory waiver conditions exists, including that the parent involuntarily lost parental rights to a sibling child, the court is <em>required </em>to grant the motion. The circuit court did not err in granting the motion to waive the obligation of BCDSS in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-6\">Constitutional Challenge</p>\n<p id=\"b103-7\">As indicated, Ms. D. contends that, if \u00a7 3-812 is construed, as we have held, to be a mandatory requirement that the court waive the obligation for reasonable efforts for reunification, then the statute is unconstitutional. As BCDSS and Joy point out, however, Ms. D. did not raise a constitutional argument before the circuit court. Accordingly, we decline to address such a challenge now. <em>See </em>Md. Rule 8-131(a). In <em>Hall v. State, </em>22 Md.App. 240, 245-46, 323 A.2d 435 (1974), we explained the significance of the lack of preservation regarding a constitutional claim:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b103-8\">On matters of such import and significance as constitutional questions, we cannot overstress the necessity of preserving the issue below.... \u201c[N]othing is better settled than the rule that the question as to the constitutionality of a statute will not be considered on appeal when not properly raised and decided by the lower court.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b103-9\">(Quoting <em>Vuitch v.
