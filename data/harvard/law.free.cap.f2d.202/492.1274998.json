The question is whether workmen\u2019s compensation was Olivieri\u2019s exclusive remedy under pertinent Louisiana statutes set out in the margin.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b549-18\">Appellant contracted with Lehon\u2019s Protection Police Service, Inc. to furnish watchmen or guards as requested by appellant for the protection of outgoing and incoming cargo at its wharves. The guards were paid by and under the supervision and orders of Lehon\u2019s, and that company was responsible to appellant for any pilfering that took place. While Olivieri was on duty as such a guard at appellant\u2019s Galvez Street Wharf, one of appellant\u2019s employees permitted some cartons or crates to fall on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>his leg causing the injuries for which the judgment was rendered. Appellant contends that the work of watching and guarding the cargo was a part of appellant\u2019s trade, business or occupation' and hence that Olivieri should be restricted to the recovery of compensation.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-4\">The jury answered a specific interrogatory as follows: <em>\u201c2. </em>Were the duties performed by the plaintiff normally part of the trade, business or occupation of the Isthmian Steamship Company? <em>no\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b550-5\">The district judge was of the opinion: \"There is substantial evidence in the record to support the jury\u2019s finding. Certainly it is a question on which reasonable men might differ.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b550-6\">After a careful review of the record, we are constrained to disagree. The court, in submitting the question to the jury, failed to give any instructions as to the tests to be applied in determining what duties would be \u201cnormally part of the trade, business or occupation\u201d of the appellant. Without knowing the standards by which the jury considered and decided that question, its verdict carries little weight. The question involves a decision upon issues of both' law and fact or, as often said, upon a mixed question of law and fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-7\"> On the law, the Louisiana cases are of course controlling. Those cases have settled that the compensation statute is to be liberally construed so as to include all services that can reasonably be said to be within the statute not only when the injured person seeks its protection, but when he attempts to have himself excluded from \u25a0the coverage of the act. The decisive factors are the nature of the employee\u2019s work and of the principal\u2019s trade, business, or occupation. Unless the work is of such a special or separate character as would not ordinarily or appropriately be performed by the principal employer\u2019s own employees in the prosecution of its business or as an essential part thereof, it is a part of the principal\u2019s trade, business or occupation. Dandridge v. Fidelity &amp; Casualty Co., La.App., 192 So. 887, 891; Thibodaux v. Sun Oil Company, La.App., 40 So.2d 761, 764, 765, affirmed 218 La. 453, 49 So.2d 852; Benoit v. Hunt Tool Co., 219 La. 380, 53 So.2d 137, 144.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-9\">While there was evidence that some steamship lines guarded their own cargo while others contracted for watchman service, all of the evidence established what is probably a matter of common knowledge, namely, that every carrier must take precautions to guard its cargo. That is an indispensable and usual part of the trade, business or occupation of every steamship line. Appropriately the service may be performed by the principal\u2019s own employees, and in many instances that is the practice. We conclude that und\u00e9r the Louisiana law as construed by its courts, and under the undisputed evidence, workmen\u2019s compensation was Olivieri\u2019s exclusive remedy. The court erred in denying the defendant\u2019s motion for a directed verdict, and the judgment is therefore</p>\n<p id=\"b550-10\">Reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b549-9\">.
