Adams, President of Richard Dye Works, Inc., and the plaintiff Cassell, knew each other for some eleven years. They called each other by their first names. Both had been in the textile business for many years. In March 1950, Cas-sell learned from a mutual friend that Adams was going into the textile business on his own. Cassell \u201ccontacted\u201d Adams to purchase \u201cremnants.\u201d Adams told Cassell that he was going to start in business soon and Cassell replied, \u201cYou will be starting soon and I will come up to see you.\u201d In February or March, 1950, Adams consulted an attorney and paid him $125. to organize a corporation for him to be known as Richard Dye Works, Inc. Adams received from his lawyer a. stock certificate and the corporate seal of the \u201ccorporation,\u201d bearing the imprint \u201cRichard Dye Works, Inc.\u201d Adams, as sole \u201cstockholder,\u201d invested $25,-000 in his business and, believing he was the \u201cpresident,\u201d acted as such.</p>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b644-17\">During the Spring of 1950 Adams organized a textile plant in Jermyn, Pennsylvania, which he operated as \u2018\u2018Richard Dye Works, Inc.\u201d The business was in operation for approximately five months, from June, 1950, to October or November, 1950. It had a plant building and office building known as \u201cRichard Dye Works, Inc.\u201d Adams, and his business enterprise leased property in the name, of \u201cRichard Dye Works, Inc.\u201d In that name he hired and paid as many as sixteen employees and took out workmen\u2019s, compensation insurance. \u201cRichard Dye Works, Inc.\u201d opened a.n account in the First National Bank of Jermyn, Pennsylvania, and made many deposits and withdrawals in the account. Adams was the .sole person authorized to sign checks. That these business operations were all conducted under the name of \u201cRichard Dye Works, Inc.,\u201d, was known to the plaintiff Cassell who had visited the plant on two occasions. .</p>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b644-18\">On 'September 15, 1950, he made one of these visits to learn if Adams \u201chad job lots to buy.\u201d Cassell saw the plant, machinery and workers. Adams informed the plaintiff that he needed \u201csome cash\u201d because he had \u201cjust started\u201d and was a \u201clittle bit exhausted.\u201d Cassell agreed to help him out. As a result of the negotia<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>tions, a contract was entered into whereby plaintiffs agreed to loan $1500. for the exclusive rights to \u201cremnants.\u201d At the conference there was a conversation between Adams and Cassell as to the payee of the check and Adams told Cassell to make it payable to the company. Cassell then gave Adams a check for $1500. made payable to \u201cRichard Dye Works, Inc.\u201d At the same time a promissory note payable to plaintiffs was executed. Cassell asked Adams to sign and endorse the note in his personal capacity; this Adams agreed to do and did. Adams told plaintiff Cassell that the money was going to be used for the business.</p>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b645-5\">The check was deposited and credited in the account of \u201cRichard Dye Works, Inc.\u201d in the First National Bank of Jermyn, Pennsylvania, which guaranteed prior endorsements. The check was forwarded to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and then to the defendant National City Bank for collection. That bank charged the amount of the check to plaintiff\u2019s account. The proceeds were used exclusively for the purposes of the business.</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b645-6\">Unknown to Adams, and unknown to the plaintiffs, the Jermyn Bank, and the other parties, \u201cRichard Dye Works, Inc.,\u201d was not a corporation since, as a result of an \u25a0oversight by Adams\u2019 lawyer, it had not been incorporated.</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b645-7\">About six weeks after the loan, the business enterprise failed. Adams lost his $25,000 investment, and the plaintiffs sustained a $1500 loss on the loan. When, later, plaintiffs learned that \u201cRichard Dye Works, Inc.,\u201d had not been incorporated, they instituted suit on March 28, 1951, against the defendant drawee bank. Defendant impleaded the Federal Reserve Bank of New York on its guarantee. Plaintiffs did not sue Adams to recoup their loss. It was not until after the institution \u2022of the instant suit that Adams learned that there was no corporation.</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b645-8\">The district court entered summary judgment for plaintiffs.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b645-9\">Kurach &amp; Cassell, New York City (Irwin Cassell, New York City, of counsel), for plaintiffs-appellees.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b645-10\">Shearman &amp; Sterling &amp; Wright, New York City (Charles C.

Adams had asked Cassell if \u201che could advance me\u201d [Adams] some money to be used for the business conducted under the corporate name, Adams being the sole owner of the business. Adams told Cassell to make his check payable to \u201cRichard Dye Works, Inc.\u201d The promissory note received by plaintiffs for this loan was signed \u201cRichard Dye Works, Inc.,\u201d and, at Cassell\u2019s request, was endorsed by Adams. The proceeds of the check were used exclusively for the purposes of the business conducted by Adams under the corporate name. Adams, in good faith, thought the corporation existed. Not until after plaintiffs began the present suit, did Adams learn that, by an oversight, his attorney had failed to complete the incorporation. In no conceivable Way did plaintiff suffer any harm because of the absence of a corporation or the honoring of the check. The fact that Adams, not the supposed corporation,, received the money was of no importance to plaintiffs. The corporate name was but a way of designating the business enterprise conducted by Adams; and it was to that enterprise that plaintiffs desired the money paid. The facts here are unlike those in the cases, cited by plaintiffs, which, in one way or another, involved some fraud or .the like.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-15\">All parties agree that Pennsylvania \u201claw\u201d governs.

But remarks in cases decided by the highest court of the state, dealing with the general, subject, convince us that it would hold, that, in cir<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>cumstances like those before us here, plaintiff could not recover.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b646-4\">Reversed and remanded to the district court with directions to enter judgment dismissing the plaintiff\u2019s complaint against the National City Bank and dismissing the complaint of the National City Bank against the third-party defendant, the Federal Reserve Bank.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b646-15\">.
