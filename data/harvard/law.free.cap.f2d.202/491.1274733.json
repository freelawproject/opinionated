M. Henderson was adjudged a bankrupt. The purpose of the bank, if allowed to intervene, was to file a motion to vacate the adjudication of said Henderson as a bankrupt,' which had previously taken place. At the outset in this court, the appellee moved to dismiss the bank\u2019s appeal, which motion will be denied and the bank\u2019s request to intervene considered on its merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-6\">.The bank\u2019s petition shows on its face that it is not a party in interest to said proceeding. If interested at all, it is only by virtue of being a preference creditor or transferee of the bankrupt, whose debt was paid or satisfied prior to the filing of the involuntary petition in bankruptcy. We think the court below committed no error in not allowing the bank to intervene.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-7\">To be an interested party, the appellant must be affected or aggrieved .by the order of adjudication. On the face of the record before us, such order does not affect it unless it m'ay be construed as adjudicating the bank to be a preference creditor 'or transferee, and it is not susceptible of any such construction.
