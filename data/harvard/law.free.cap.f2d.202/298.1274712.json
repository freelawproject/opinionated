Operating as authorized on a frequency of 740 kilocycles, the new station would interfere with station KSEO which broadcasts from nearby Durant, Oklahoma, on a 750 kilocycle frequency. In fact, the stronger Texas Star signal threatens KSEO with daytime<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> displacement of its signal in an area including as much \u00e1s 41 per cent of the population previously served by that station.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Because of this threat the Democrat Printing Company, licensee of KSEO, intervened in the proceeding before the Commission. Its intervention proved insufficient to prevent issuance of a permit t\u00f3 Texas Star and so it appealed to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-16\">\n<em>I. Comparative Hearing</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b356-17\">There is no question but that Texas Star\u2019s substantial electrical .interference with KSEO is in fact and in legal effect a modification of KSEO\u2019s existing license.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Such modification can be authorized if</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A8E\">\u201cin the judgment of the Commission [it] will promote the public interest, convenience, and necessity <em>* * </em>*.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"AON\">The Commission\u2019s Rule 3.24 further spells out this statutory requirement in modification cases:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b356-18\">\u201cAn authorization for a new standard broadcast station or increase in facilities of an existing, station will be issued only after a satisfactory showing has been made in regard to the following, among others: * * *.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b356-19\">\u201c(b) That objectionable interference wilt not be caused to existing stations or that <em>if interference will be caused the need for the proposed service outweighs the need for the service which </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number><em>will be lost by reason of such interference.\u201d </em><footnotemark>5</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b357-5\">If the requirements of the public interest are to be satisfied, the Commission must consider not only the public benefit from the operation of the new station, but also any public loss which it might occasion. Only by such a balancing can the Commission reach a legally valid conclusion on the ultimate question of the public interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-6\">Here the record establishes only one side of the equation \u2014 that the Dallas area needs the type of service proposed by Texas Star and that Texas Star is fit, willing and able to provide that service.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> But there is nothing whatsoever which goes to the question of \u201cthe service which will be lost\u201d as a result of KSEO\u2019s displacement by Texas Star. In fact, the Commission specifically said that it</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b357-7\">\u201cdid not rest its decision upon any comparative consideration of KSEO and the Dallas proposal, but upon the conclusion that although the interference to KSEO be as serious as portrayed by that station, a grant of Texas Star\u2019s application would be in the public interest and consonant with the requirement of a fair, efficient and equitable distribution of radio service between communities.\u201d <footnotemark>7</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b357-8\">By refusing to base its decision upon a \u201ccomparative consideration of KSEO and the Dallas proposal,\u201d the Commission effectively discarded its Rule 3.24 and overlooked one factor which is inherent in the complex of the public interest. Suppose, for example, that KSEO devoted a large portion of its broadcasting efforts to meeting the particular needs of the people in the interference area, that many of its programs originated there, and that it was the only station which was especially solicitous of that particular area. Obviously in such a case, the listeners affected might well need the station threatened with displacement more than they would if it did not program especially for them and if other stations, including the proposed one, did. We do not say that the Commission would have to refuse the license in the first case and grant it in the second. We say only that where 164,300 people are threatened with loss of a broadcast service, as here, the Commission could not regard as irrelevant what Rule 3.24 and the public interest command \u2014 a determination as to the comparative merits of the two stations in the area of interference.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-17\">Nor does it suffice to say that since Texas Star\u2019s signal will replace KSEO\u2019s for the interference area, there is no \u201closs of service\u201d within the meaning of Rule 3.24. We do not see how the Commission can adopt qualitative criteria of need to justify Texas Star\u2019s entry upon the Dallas scene and then use purely quantitative criteria of coverage to determine \u201cneed for the services * * * lost by reason of such interference.\u201d This last is as much a composite of program content, facilities and ties to the area served as is the former.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b357-18\">The Commission argues that even if the record is defective in this regard, it was incumbent upon KSEO, the station being ousted, to offer evidence on comparative need in the interference area. We are unable to accept this contention. For both the hearing examiner and the Commission viewed as irrelevant any evidence on the effect which the ouster of KSEO would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>have on the audience now receiving its signal. Texas Star, upon whom Rule 3.24 appears to place the burden of proof in this regard,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> attempted to show that \u201cKSEO does not now, nor has it in the past, programmed for the area which might be subjected to interference * * But the hearing officer rejected this evidence and foreclosed proof along these lines.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Likewise the Commission apparently agreed with its hearing examiner on' this point since, as quoted above, it did not consider \u201ccomparative consideration * * * relevant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b358-6\">\n<em>II. Financial Effect on KSEO</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b358-7\">KSEO also urges that there was no substantial evidence to support the Commission\u2019s finding that \u201cthe grant to Texas Star will not impair the ability of KSEO to continue to serve the local Durant area.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> We agree with KSEO on this point too. It does not suffice as a basis for that finding for the Commission to say that \u201cKSEO will still continue to serve 45 miles to the south of Durant in the direction of Dallas.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> KSEO may or may not be able to survive financially if its signal is blocked out by the proposed interference. The evidence furnishes no basis for an answer.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Adequate evidence on this question might include, for example, the amount of advertising revenue KSEO would lose as a result of the interference, the way in which its expenses would be affected, as well as evidence on its general financial health.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b358-18\">In this court, the Commission advances in support of this phase of its order a reason not relied upon in its decision, namely, the failure of KSEO to present evidence showing that it would suffer adverse financial effects from the proposed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>operation of Texas Star. Since this data was more peculiarly within the knowledge of KSEO than of Texas Star, the Commission might have been justified in concluding that \u201cthe public is not likely to suffer if the evidence is not sufficiently strong to prevent the appellant from forgetting it at the proper time in [its] own behalf.\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> But we cannot decide now whether this reason suffices to support the order. Our review is limited to the reasons which the Commission relied upon for its action.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AsB\">\n<em>III. Violations of Federal Communications Commission\u2019s Standards</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"Azo\">KSEO bases two further arguments on several alleged deviations from the Commission\u2019s Standards of Good Engineering Practice Concerning Standard Broadcasting Stations. First, these deviations are said to be so far-reaching as to amount to a change in Commission policy. Changes in policy, according to \u00a7 409(a) of the Federal Communications Act,<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> cannot be made in proceedings where, as in this one, an examiner presides. Second, KSEO argues that since there is nothing in the record to justify the Commission\u2019s departures from its Standards, the departures are arbitrary and capricious.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-10\">With one exception, which we shall discuss in a moment, all of these alleged errors are raised for the first time in this court. Therefore, even if they are meritorious, a question we do not reach, they are raised too late. The alleged violations could have been asserted in the exceptions to the proposed decision and in the motion for rehearing which was filed after the final decision.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Since appellant has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>denied the Commission the first opportunity to state its views on the errors now being asserted, appellant cannot seek here the relief which it should have sought initially before the Commission.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b360-4\">As mentioned above, KSEO did preserve its right to a decision here on the merits of one alleged violation of Commission Standards. As applied here, \u00a7 4 of the Standards provides as a general guide that the broadcasting transmitter shall be located so that not more than one per cent of the metropolitan population sought to be served by the station will be living within the \u201cblanket area\u201d <footnotemark>20</footnotemark> of the transmitter. The Standards further state that \u201cthe Commission will give consideration to approving locations\u201d which constitute a deviation from the normal blanket area requirements where \u201cit is impossible or impractical to locate a station in accordance with the [normal] specifications\u201d upon the following three conditions: (1) \u201cnot more than 1 percent of the population * * * is included within the 500 millivolt per meter contour\u201d; (2) \u201cthe applicant submits an affidavit setting forth the reasons why the normal specifications cannot be complied with\u201d; (3) \u201cthe applicant will assume full responsibility for adjustment of any reasonable complaints arising from the excessively strong signals.\u201d <footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b360-12\">We agree with KSEO that this Standard has been violated. On the record before us, it is somewhat difficult to determine precisely what showing was made to the Commission and what the Commission found. But it is clear that the grant to Texas Star violated even the \u201cexception\u201d to the normal requirements. The Commission found that 1.3 per cent of the population would be residing within the 500 mv/ meter contour instead of the specified one per cent. In other words, Texas Star was proposing an exception to the exception. More important, however, is the fact that Texas Star did not submit the required affidavit nor any other document purporting to show that, it was \u201cimpossible or impractical to locate [the] station in accordance with the normal specifications.\u201d We think the Commission admitted this when it stated that Texas Star \u201coffered no evidence to show that consideration was given to any [transmitter] sites other than the ones specified herein.\u201d <footnotemark>22</footnotemark> Nor does the Commission suggest any reason why, in the public interest, the showing of no alternative site should not be required in this case. The Standard just quoted seems to authorize deviations from even the normal transmitter site requirements only where the public interest so requires and then only where compliance with the normal specifications is not practical.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> <em>A fortiori, </em>then, a court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>cannot reach the question of validity of a departure from the exception to the normal rule where the showing of impracticality has neither been made nor its absence explained.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b361-5\">\n<em>IV. Administrative Procedure Act</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b361-6\">The final argument which we consider in detail is appellant\u2019s contention that the Commission order violates those provisions of \u00a7 5(c) of the Administrative Procedure Act<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> which require generally that decision-making and investigative or prosecuting functions of an agency be separated.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> Before the hearings were held, the Commission announced that \u00a7 5(c) did not apply to these proceedings.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> We need not decide whether the Commission was correct in this view, for KSEO has waived its right to have that issue decided in this court. The Commission\u2019s rules required KSEO to make a timely objection in advance of the hearings to Commission\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7 5(c).<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> This KSEO failed to do.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-7\">KSEO now says that the requirements of \u00a7 5(c) are mandatory and that waiver is impossible. We think this position untenable. The legislative history clearly indicates the possibility of specific waiver:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b361-9\">\u201cNo agency action taken or refused would be lawful except as done in full compliance with all applicable provisions of the bill and subject to the judicial review provided. No agreed waiver of its provisions would suffice unless entirely voluntary and without any manner or form of coercion.\u201d <footnotemark>29</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b361-10\">And waiver by non-action would reasonably follow where, as here, timely objection would have given the agency an opportunity to correct errors at the threshold of the proceedings which might otherwise require the subsequent invalidation of the entire proceeding.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b361-11\">We think additional reasons for reversal advanced by appellant are without sufficient merit to warrant discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-12\">Remanded for further proceedings in accordance with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-13\">WILBUR K.

Acting according to this view, KSEO presented no evidence at the hearing other than engineering evidence on the extent of the interference.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-8\">We think that KSEO\u2019s interpretation of the hearing issues is unduly restrictive.

Ibid.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"22\">\n<p id=\"b360-11\">. J.A., p. 225. The Joint Appendix prepared for the use of this court contains no affidavit or other documentary evidence of the sort required by the blanket area rule. An independent study of the original record likewise fails to disclose such .documents.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"23\">\n<p id=\"b360-14\">. The Commission has not consistently interpreted the requirements of the blanket area standards. On the one hand, it has laid considerable stress on the availability or non-availability of alternative transmitter sites in disapproving or approving proposed deviations from the Standards, News-Press Publishing Co., 6 Pike &amp; Fisher Radio Reg. 1290, 1294-1295 (1951); cf. Miami Broadcasting Co., 10 F.C.C. 137 (1943). On the other hand, the Commission has permitted deviations from the Standards without considering, ' apparently, the availability of other transmitter sites. See Del Paso Broadcasting Co., 4 Pike &amp; Fisher Radio Reg. 679 (1948); The Corbin Time-Tribune, Inc., 6 Pike &amp; Fisher Radio Reg. 396 (1950).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"24\">\n<p id=\"b361-14\">. Texas Star argues that the order approving the proposed location of its transmitter should be affirmed since Texas Star offered \u201cto accept responsibility for adjusting all reasonable complaints which may arise from blanket interference.\u201d J.A., p. 225. It was certainly proper for Texas Star to make such an offer. But that is already required by the Standard, and Texas Star\u2019s willingness to comply with this part of the Standard does not excuse its noncompliance with the remainder.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"25\">\n<p id=\"b361-15\">. 60 Stat. 237, 240, 5 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1004 (c).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"26\">\n<p id=\"b361-16\">.
