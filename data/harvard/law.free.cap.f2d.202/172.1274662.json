The case did not go to trial, the parties agreeing to a consent judgment, which was entered by the district court on April 28, 1950. In August of 1951, plaintiff filed the present petition, alleging that defendant had violated the decree by its sale of a slavish imitation of plaintiff\u2019s can opener, thus deceiving prospective purchasers into regarding defendant\u2019s opener as plaintiff\u2019s.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-10\">Plaintiff makes and sells a can opener called the \u201cSafety Roll Jr.\u201d Since the entry of the consent decree, defendant has made and sold, and threatens to continue to do so, a can opener which the district court found to be \u201csubstantially identical in design and dimensions to the \u2018Safety Roll Jr.\u2019 with the exception that the handle has hook-shaped openings at each end such as used in bottle openers whereas the \u2018Safety Roll Jr.\u2019 has closed ends with a circular hole near each end of the handle.\u201d D.C., W.D. Pa. 1952, 105 F.Supp. 595, 596. Defendant\u2019s opener has stamped on the handle \u201cG. G. Greene, Warren, Pa.,\u201d while plaintiff\u2019s opener has the following directions on its handle: \u201cIf Blade Sticks Wash in Hot</p>\n<p id=\"b229-15\">Water\u201d and has on its frame \u201cVaughan Safety Roll Jr. Trade Mark Can Opener.\u201d The district court held that all parts of plaintiff\u2019s opener were functional and, therefore, concluded that only Section 9 of the consent decree was relevant.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> It held also that the phrase \u201cspecial significance\u201d as used in the decree was equivalent to \u201csecondary meaning\u201d as that phrase is used in unfair competition cases. The court found that plaintiff\u2019s evidence had established only that there was a considerable public demand for a can opener like plaintiff\u2019s and that there was no showing that the public purchased it because of its source. Consequently, the court concluded that plaintiff\u2019s opener had not acquired a special significance and, thus, that defendant had not violated the decree. Alternatively, it held that, even were it convinced that plaintiff\u2019s opener had acquired a special significance, plaintiff could not prevail because the steps taken by defendant to distinguish its opener from plaintiff\u2019s were reasonable and, therefore, legally sufficient. We think the district court\u2019s result was correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>In the consent decree, the parties wrote their own private code of unfair competition. Our first task is to discover the meaning o'f Sections 8 and 9 of that private code,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> which sections are the only ones relevant to this proceeding. On this question, we agree with the finding of the district court that the terms used in the decree were intended to be given a meaning consonant with that given them in unfair competition cases. Indeed, a reading of Section 741 of the Restatement of the Law of Torts indicates that, in drafting the decree the parties may have used that section as a formbook.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In short, we think that Sections 8 and 9 of the decree are no more than a concise statement of that phase of the law of unfair competition relating to.confusion of source by the imitation of the physical appearance of another\u2019s <em>goods.</em><footnotemark><em>4</em></footnotemark><em> </em>By Sections 8 and 9 of the decree, plaintiff got no more than defendant\u2019s agreement to do what it was already bound to do under the law. Plaintiff tells us that this construction rewrites the decree which, of course, we may not do. Plaintiff says that the phrase \u201csecondary meaning\u201d was deliberately rejected and \u201cspecial significance\u201d was chosen because the parties sell, not to the general public, but to jobbers, distributors, and chain organizations. We fail to see why the principle of secondary meaning would not apply equally well to sales to both of those groups. In any event, we think that special significance has the same content as does secondary meaning.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Plaintiff has not pointed out, nor have we found, any judicial assertion to the contrary. Consequently, this is an ordinary unfair competition case.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b231-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>After applying the customary test,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> the district court concluded that plaintiff had failed to establish that its opener had acquired a special significance identifying it as plaintiff\u2019s product. Naturally, plaintiff attacks that conclusion, and we concede that it is a close question. In our view of the case, however, we need not take a stand on the mattter. We will assume that the shape and size of plaintiff\u2019s opener had acquired a special significance.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-5\">The district court found that the two openers were substantially identical, and a mere glance confirms that conclusion. But no express finding was made as to whether the degree of similarity was such as would be, in the words of the decree, \u201clikely to cause prospective purchasers to regard defendant\u2019s products as plaintiff\u2019s products * * We think, however, that a finding of substantial identity sufficiently indicates the district court\u2019s view that there was confusing similarity. Had the court felt that there was not such similarity, the matter would have ended there. Its subsequent conclusions that the imitated features were functional and that defendant had taken reasonable steps to avoid confusion are meaningful only upon the assumption that the products were confusingly similar.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-17\">The district court further concluded that all parts of plaintiff\u2019s opener were functional. It must be borne in mind that the word \u201cfunctional\u201d in these imitation cases does not mean merely utilitarian. It is <em>much </em>broader.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> However that <em>may be, </em>plaintiff does not question the conclusion that all parts of its opener are functional.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Indeed, the arguments in both its main and reply brief are based on the assumption that the copied features of its opener are functional. Consequently, we shall so treat them here.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b232-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>The defendant\u2019s Chinese copy is a result of its imitation of all the functional features of plaintiff\u2019s opener. This is not enough, however, to require defendant to stop making and selling its imitation. The consuming public .has an interest in making use of the functional features of plaintiff\u2019s opener, superior to plaintiff\u2019s interest in being their sole vendor. Since the items copied are functional, defendant has as much right to use them as does plaintiff, even though plaintiff may have been their originator. All that plaintiff may justly demand is that defendant take reasonable steps to prevent buyers of defendant\u2019s opener from thinking they have bought plaintiff\u2019s.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b232-4\">Defendant has inscribed on the handle of its opener \u201cG. G. Greene, Warren, Pa.\u201d The size of the lettering is at least as large as the inscription on plaintiff\u2019s opener. \u201cIn the light of plaintiff\u2019s indication by its own practice that the manner in which its name is printed upon the Blony wrapper is sufficient to inform the public of the origin of its product, we cannot hold that the substantially similar way in which the defendant prints its name upon the wrappers of its product is insufficient for the same purpose.\u201d Gum v. Gumakers of America, 3 Cir., 1943, 136 F.2d 957, 960. Labeling is often the only reasonable step to take to avoid confusion.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> To require more is to say in the same breath that defendant may copy because the feature is functional, yet, in order to avoid confusing the source, he may not copy. In design and size the two openers are very much alike but as to the inscriptions .thereon they are very different. They are similar where similarity is allowed and different where difference is required. That is enough.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-8\">Defendant\u2019s only witness, one Hutley, a tool and die designer for defendant, testified that after the entry of the consent decree he made three new handles, but that these proposed changes were rejected because they used too much stock, were two expensive, did not have eye appeal, or had a tendency to catch on the finger as it was turned in opening a can. We think that these proposed changes, and the reasons for their rejection,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> substantiate our conclusion that labeling is the only reasonable way to indicate source here.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-9\">But, says plaintiff, the labeling had been done before the decree, and, thus, defendant took no steps whatsoever to indicate source after the decree. The argument is that by the decree defendant was bound to take additional steps, thereafter, to prevent confusion, but that defendant has done nothing that was not part of its former practice. We are told that to allow this makes the decree worthless. If our conclusion is correct, however, that the decree <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>is merely a restatement of the common law rules covering imitation of another\u2019s goods, the result is that defendant\u2019s opener, as it was before the decree, did not constitute an actionable imitation of plaintiff\u2019s opener, and, thus, was not such an imitation after the decree.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-4\">For the reasons slated, the judgment of tile district court will be affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b229-11\">. The pertinent sections of the decree are as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b229-12\">\u201c8. Defendant shall not manufacture, offer for sale, or sell products copying or imitating such of the nonfunctional features of products manufactured by plaintiff as have acquired generally a special significance identifying plaintiff\u2019s products, where the copy or imitation is likely to cause prospective purchasers to regard defendant\u2019s products as those of plaintiff.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b229-13\">\u201c9. Defendant has the right to manufacture, offer for sale, and sell products which copy and imitate the functional features of products manufactured by plaintiff, provided that such functional features are not protected by currently effective Letters Patent, and provided further that, where the copied or imitated functional features of plaintiff\u2019s products have acquired generally a special significance identifying plaintiff\u2019s products, and the copying or imitating of such functional features by defendant is likely to cause prospective purchasers to regard defendant\u2019s products as plaintiff\u2019s products, defendant must take reasonable steps to prevent confusion.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b229-17\">The decree shows that, while the bottle-cap remover was the only item specifically mentioned, the parties did intend to establish rules for all of their competing products.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b230-4\">.

All of them presuppose that the appearance of the article, like its descriptive title in true eases of \u2018secondary\u2019 meaning, has become associated in the public mind with the first comer as manufacturer or source, and, if a second comer imitates the article exactly, that the public will believe his goods have come from the first, and will buy, in part, at least, because of that deception.\u201d Crescent Tool Co. v.
