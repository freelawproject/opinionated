Before discussing the errors complained of a brief statement of the factual background is in order.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-5\">The defendant, Leo Link, was tried on a four-count indictment charging him with filing false and fraudulent income tax returns for 1946, 1947, 1948 and 1949. He was found guilty on all four counts and sentenced to jail for four years and fined $10,000 and costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-6\">The evidence adduced at the trial established that the defendant engaged in \u201cbookmaking\u201d activities under the name of J. W. Donaldson using the facilities of the Western Union Telegraph Company. The methods pursued were as follows: Bettors wired money orders to the defendant with instructions to bet on their choices at various race tracks; when the bettors won they were paid via Western Union money orders; when horses were \u201cscratched\u201d (failed to start) refunds were made by money orders- or by check on a Hudson County bank. It is perhaps needless to add that the defendant did not actually place the bets at the various race tracks but \u201cbooked\u201d them himself.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-7\">The government offered in evidence books and records of the defendant and the Western Union which clearly proved the scope and nature of the defendant\u2019s operations. Moreover currency in the amount of $127,000 was found in a safe in the home of defendant\u2019s mother-in-law with whom he lived. He claimed that $102,000 of the money belonged to the mother-in-law and that only $25,000 belonged to a mysterious principal for whom he worked on a fee -basis \u2014 25 cents on each bet placed.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-8\">Government witnesses submitted calculations, based on testimony of Western Union employees and available records, fixing defendant\u2019s gross receipts for the four taxable years involved at approximately $1,-063,000 and his net income at approximately $257,000. In its calculations the government allowed deductions in the amount of some $800,000 \u2014 amounts paid to winners and refunds on \u201cscratches\u201d. It also 'allowed an additional $6,000 comprised largely of defendant\u2019s standard deductions allowable by law.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-11\">The -crux -of defendant\u2019s contention at the trial was that he was merely the \u201cfront\u201d through whom the \u201cbookmaking\u201d operations were carried on; that he merely retained a commission of 25 cents on each bet and that he had reported his entire income in -his tax returns and paid the tax due thereon.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b649-12\">Three questions are raised by the defendant on this appeal. We will dispose of them in the order presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-13\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b649-14\"> The defendant first urges the trial court erred in its instructions on burden of proof. The trial judge in his instructions to the jury charged that: \u201c* * * the burden is upon the defendant to prove that he had other deductions and lawful expenses not shown in his return.\u201d This instruction, the defendant urges, was erroneous. We do not agree. The government by its testimony established unreported income and allowed deductions claimed by defendant and other deductions that it could calculate without his assistance. It is well-settled that \u201cEvidence of unexplained funds or property in the hands of a taxpayer establishes a prima facie case of understatement of income\u201d and that \u201cIt is then incumbent on the defendant to overcome the logical inferences to be drawn from the facts proved.\u201d United States v. Hornstein, 7 Cir., 1949, 176 F.2d 217, 220. In Gariepy v. United States, 6 Cir., 1951, 189 F.2d 459, 463, it was held that \u201c * * * the government is not required to prove a negative * * * Here too, the government is not required to prove the negative, i. e. that the defendant did not have any other deductions. Other deductions, if there were any, could have easily been established by the defendant. By its proof the government established its prima facie case, and the burden of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>going ahead with the evidence of additional expenses which equalled or exceeded gross income was on the defendant. Cf. United States v. Venuto, 3 Cir., 1950, 182 F.2d 519.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b650-5\">The defendant also complains that the trial judge erred iix his instructions as to the rule of reasonable doubt.' There is merit to this complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-6\">Although the trial judge correctly defined the rule at the beginning of his charge, and referred to it again repeatedly, he unfortunately, added the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AGN\">\u201cYou are further instructed that if you find the evidence as to this defendant equally balanced, that is, that it is as consistent with' innocence as it is with guilt, you must acquit the defendant and find him not guilty. . In other words, if after you consider all of the evidence and you put it in the scales and you weigh it in your minds you honestly and conscientiously find and believe that the evidence- as it has been produced here is as equally consistent with the innocence of this man as it is with his guilt, you must acquit him and find him not guilty, because as I said, he must be proven guilty beyond, a reasonable doubt.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b650-8\">And again, near the conclusion of his charge, the trial judge said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b650-9\">\u201cAnd so * * * if you find the' evidence respecting the defendant is as consistent with his innocence as with his guilt, you must acquit him.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b650-11\">In our' 'opinion the added instructions quoted might well have served to confuse the jury.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> As was recently said by Judge Goodrich, speaking for this Court in United States v. Martell, 3 Cir., 1952, 199 F.2d 670, 672:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b650-17\">\u201cNo one can know for certain what a given portion of a charge does to the collective minds of the jury but this particular point complained of was in a charge made after the jury had been recalled and constituted the last thing they were told when they retired to consider their verdict. We think the probability of confusion was such as to create reversible error.\u201d <footnotemark>4</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b650-18\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b650-19\">A further and final complaint of the defendant is directed at the following statement of the trial judge in the very last portion of his chrage:<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b650-20\"><em>\u201c </em>* * * But if on the other hand you find that the law has been violated as charged in this indictment, then you should not hesitate, because of sympathy, prejudice or any extraneous consideration of any kind, to fender a verdict of guilty as a clear warning to all that crime cannot be committed with impunity in the United States and go unpunished. <em>The people of this State and of the United States are entitled to be assured of this conviction.\u201d </em>(Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b650-21\">In our opinion the statement that \u201cThe people of this State and of the United States are entitled to be assured of this conviction\u201d was prejudicial to the defendant and was clearly erroneous for it may well have been construed by the jury as an instruction to render a verdict of guilty. At the very least it could well have been construed by the jury as an emphatic expression by the trial judge of the defend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>ant\u2019s guilt and it is needless to say that such a construction would perforce weigh heavily in the jury\u2019s deliberations.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-5\">While it is true that in exceptional cases a trial judge may express his opinion that the evidence established the defendant\u2019s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, it is well-settled that in doing so he must in unequivocal terms caution the jury that it is not bound by his opinion and that it is the jury\u2019s exclusive function to determine the question of the accused\u2019s innocence or guilt.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b651-6\">Trial judges must always keep in mind the possible, if not probable, effect of any statement which they may make in the course of a trial or in their instructions to the jury. As was said in Starr v. United States, 1894, 153 U.S. 614, 626, 14 S.Ct. 919, 923, 38 L.Ed. 841:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b651-7\">\u201cIt is obvious that under any system of jury trials the influence of the trial judge on the jury is necessarily and properly of great weight, and that his lightest word or intimation is received with deference, and may prove controlling.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b651-8\">In Bollenbach v. United' States, 1946, 326 U.S. 607, 612, 66 S.Ct. 402, 405, 90 L.Ed. 350, the Supreme Court quoted with approval this statement in Starr v. United States and in doing so noted that \u201c * * * <em>jurors are ever watchful of the words that fall from him </em>(the trial judge). <em>Particularly in a criminal trial, the judge\u2019s last word is apt to he the decisive word.\u201d </em>(Emphasis supplied.)</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b651-11\">\u201cIn the circumstances we think the trial judge erred in stating the opinion that the respondent was guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. A federal judge may analyze the evidence, comment upon it, and express his views with regard to the testimony of witnesses. He may advise the jury in respect of the facts, but the decision of issues of fact must be fairly left to the jury. Patton v. United States, 281 U.S. 276, 288, 50 S.Ct. 253, 74 L.Ed. 854; Quercia v. United State, 289 U. S. 466, 53 S.Ct. 698, 77 L.Ed. 321. <em>Although the power of the judge to express an opinion as to the guilt of the defendant exists, it should he exercised cautiously and only in exceptional oases.\u201d </em>(Emphasis supplied.) Exceptional cases have-been held to be ones in which the facts are virtually undisputed. United States v. Meltzer, 7 Cir., 1938, 100 F.2d 739, 747; Hartzell v. United States, 8 Cir., 1934, 72 F.2d 569, 586; United States v. Raub, 7 Cir., 1949, 177 F.2d 312; Billeci v. United States, 1950, 87 U.S.App.D.C. 274, 184 F.2d 394, 402, 403, 24 A.L.R.2d 881.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b651-14\">In the instant case there was a dispute, albeit a fragile one, as to basic facts. Defendant contended, he was merely a \u201cfront\u201d man in a \u201cbookmaking\u201d operation headed by others he could not or would not name; that his only profit was a 25 cent service charge on each bet; and that the $127,000 found by the New Jersey authorities belonged partly to those who owned the illegal business and partly to his mother-in-law. It is conceivable, however unlikely, that the jury might have believed the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-15\">For the reasons stated we are constrained to reverse and to direct a new trial. It is regrettable that we are compelled to do so because the record clearly discloses that there was ample evidence to support the jury\u2019s verdict of guilty and on this appeal no question was raised with respect to the correctness of the trial judge\u2019s rulings on the admission of evidence and the conduct of the trial except with respect to his charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-16\">For the reasons stated the judgment of the District Court will be reversed and the case remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b648-15\">. This section provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b648-16\">\u201cAny person required under this chapter to collect, account for, and pay over any tax imposed by this chapter, who willfully fails to collect or truthfully account for and pay over such tax, and any person who willfully attempts in any manner to evade or defeat any tax imposed by this chapter or the payment thereof, shall, in addition to other penalties provided by law, be guilty of a felony and, upon conviction thereof, be fined not more than $10,000, or imprisoned for not more than five years, or both, together with the costs of prosecution.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b649-9\">. The aggregate net income reported by the defendant for the taxable years involved was $9,553.77 on which he paid a tax of $748.00. According to the government\u2019s testimony ho should have paid a tax of $136,291.20 on a net income of $257,000.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b650-12\">. Indeed, in United States v. Matsinger, 3 Cir., 1951, 191 F.2d 1014, 1016, we pointed out that \u201c * * * a case may not be submitted to a jury when the actions of the accused are as consistent with innocence as with guilt * *</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b650-13\">. In Boatright v. United States, 8 Cir., 1939, 105 F.2d 737, at page 740, the trial judge charged: \u201cIf * * * there should arise in this case a reasonable doubt as to the\u2019 guilt of the defendants * * * it would be your duty to * * * acquit * * * them <em>as the doubt might justify or warrant you in doing.\u201d </em>In reversing a judgment for the United States, the Court said, 105 E\\2d at page 740: \u201cJust what is meant by the limitation \u2018as the doubt might justify or warrant you in doing\u2019, is not deal-, and we think the defendants were entitled to an instruction on reasonable doubt -without such limitation.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b650-23\">. The statement was made in the trial judge\u2019s additional charge to the jury in the course of ruling on the defendant\u2019s exceptions to the court\u2019s charge in chief.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b651-9\">. The rule on this subject was clearly stated in United States v. Murdock, 1933, 290 U.S. 389, 394, 54 S.Ct. 223, 225, <em>78 </em>L.Ed. 381:</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
