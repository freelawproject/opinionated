S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2421 and 2423. On March 31, 1952, defendant entered a plea of not guilty and on the same day appeared before a United States Commissioner, who ordered that an appearance bond in the sum of $10,000 be given. A bond in that sum in the usual form was executed by the defendant as principal and by Etta Mae Ferguson as surety. The negotiations for the bond were carried on by the husband of the surety, John Ferguson, a professional bondsman licensed under the laws of the State of Illinois, and who received a fee of $500. Both defendant and surety were notified that the trial of the case was set for June 30, 1952. The jury and a number of witnesses subpoenaed were present at the appointed time, but the defendant did not put in an appearance. The district judge ordered the bond forfeited and issued a bench warrant for defendant\u2019s arrest. The following day the United States Attorney asked the court to enter a judgment of default on the bond. The matter was continued for hearing until July 29, 1952.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-5\">Defendant was arrested in El Paso, Texas, on July 8, 1952, by agents of the F. B.I. and was returned to Springfield, Illinois. On July 27th and 28th, John Ferguson visited defendant at the jail, and urged him to enter a plea of guilty and suggested that it would be to defendant\u2019s advantage to save the government the expense of a trial; further, that defendant would not then need the services of a lawyer. He also suggested that based upon his experience in other cases, defendant might expect a sentence of two to five years on each count, same to run concurrently.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-6\">On July 29, 1952, the defendant appeared before the district judge and informed him that he did not desire the services of an attorney, withdrew his plea of not guilty, and entered a plea of guilty, as charged. The court thereupon sentenced defendant to six consecutive terms, totaling twenty years. During a colloquy that followed defendant said to the court, \u201cYou can thank Mr. Ferguson that I pleaded guilty.\u201d At another point in the hearing defendant said that he was guilty, but not to the extent charged.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-8\">After the sentence was imposed and when the court was considering the government\u2019s motion for judgment on the appearance bond, the surety requested that there be remitted to her the amount of the bond over and above such sum as would fairly compensate the government for the expenses incurred by it by reason of defendant\u2019s failure to appear on June 30. However, the court ordered that judgment be entered for the full amount of the bond, saying, \u201cThis defendant undoubtedly has caused the government an expense probably in excess of the face of this bond. I only know in a small way about the expenses incurred by the government at the time the case was set for trial. I know a jury was summoned, especially for this case, the only case. Various witnesses from remote parts of the country were here, and the expense of all of that has been borne by the government. I don\u2019t know just what the expenses of the F.B.I. have been in the apprehending of this man who failed to appear here on June 30. He was arrested down in Texas and brought here to trial. The expense has been very large; not only the F.B.I. in Springfield, but the F.B.I. all over the country was alerted to find this man.\u201d Testimony was not received as to the amount of the expenses which had been incurred by the government.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-9\">The surety contends that there was an abuse of the district court\u2019s discretion in failing to remit some part of the amount of the bond, and draws our attention to the following facts with reference to which there is little, if any, dispute. Although John Ferguson was not acquainted with the defendant, he was requested by friends of the defendant to execute the bond. The Sheriff of Clinton \u2019County said that he thought defendant was all right, and rec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"624\">*624</page-number>ommended that Ferguson go on his bond. Several days prior to June 30 Ferguson contacted defendant who assured him that he would be present at the trial. After the default, Ferguson made three or four trips to Quincy, Illinois, and one late at night to East St. Louis, endeavoring to locate the defendant. In the attempt to ascertain defendant\u2019s whereabouts Ferguson also placed several long-distance telephone calls, talking among others to defendant\u2019s mother. Ferguson testified he knew the F.B.I. was looking for defendant and did not wish his efforts to conflict with their plans or activities. Surety also points out that after defendant was arrested, Mr. Ferguson was instrumental in having defendant plead guilty, which saved the government the expense of a trial. The surety argues that as to the expense of the jury and witnesses mentioned by the district judge, had defendant appeared on June 30 and stood trial the surety would not have been liable for any part of these expenses and that by defendant\u2019s plea of guilty on July <em>29, </em>it became unnecessary for the government to incur such expenses again.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-4\">\u25a0Surety admits that the default of the defendant was willful. Prior to March 21, 1946, under the applicable statute, 18 U.S. C. \u00a7 601, the courts had consistently held that a district court had no power to remit any part of the forfeiture where the default on the part of a defendant was willful. Continental Casualty Co. v. United States, 314 U.S. 527, 62 S.Ct. 393, 86 L.Ed. 426; United States v. Legg, 4 Cir., 157 F.2d <em>990.</em></p>\n<p id=\"A5B\">The Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure became effective March 21, 1946, and Rule 46(f)(2), 18 U.S.C., provides, \u201cThe court may direct that a forfeiture be set aside, upon such conditions as the court may impose, if if appears that justice does not require the enforcement of the forfeiture.\u201d It is evident that under this rule a district court has a discretion to give relief to bondsmen in criminal cases upon default, even though such default be willful. It is stated in Barron and Holt-zoff, Federal Practice and Procedure, Vol. 4, Sec. 2507, p. 419, \u201cThus the court may now remit the forfeiture even though the defendant willfully defaulted and may base a partial remission upon considerations of expense and inconvenience to the government.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b680-9\">The surety insists that the above-narrated facts show that the language of Rule 46(f)(2), \u201c* * * justice does not require the enforcement of the forfeiture,\u201d is applicable, and points to the language of Chief Justice Marshall in United States v. Feely, Fed.Cas.No.15,082, 1 Brock 255, \u201cThe object of a recognizance is, not to-enrich the treasury, * * She points-out that when, under the old statute, the-courts had no discretion, Congress frequently passed private acts remitting the forfeiture in part after deducting an amount sufficient to recompense the government for any expenses incurred by it as-the result of the default.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Surety also urges that the record does not contain any evidence as to the expenditures incurred' by the government and that it became incumbent upon the government to prove to-a reasonable degree the monies expended in connection with the default.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-11\">The government points out that Congressional private acts remitting a portion of the forfeiture were usually enacted where bondsmen produced the defendant, and that such was not the case here. The government argues that at best remission of a. forfeiture is granted as an act of grace, United States v. Mack, 295 U.S. 480, 489, 55 S.Ct. 813, 79 L.Ed. 1559, and that in the case at bar the district court did not abuse its discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-12\">Although we believe that this is a case where the district court might well have remitted a. portion of the amount forfeited, we cannot say that there was an. abuse of discretion. We must keep in mind that the discretion is to be exercised by the district court and not by a court of review. This court should not substitute its discretion for that of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-13\">\u201cThe term \u2018discretion\u2019 denotes the absence of a hard and fast rule. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"625\">*625</page-number>Styria v. Morgan, 186 U.S. 1, 9, 22 S.Ct. 731, 46 L.Ed. 1027. When invoked as a g'uide to judicial action, it means a sound discretion, that is to say, a discretion exercised not arbitrarily or willfully, but with regard to what is right and equitable under the circumstances and the law, and directed by the reason and conscience of the judge to a just result.\u201d Langnes v. Green, 282 U.S. 531, 541, 51 S.Ct. 243, 247, 75 L. Ed. 520.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-5\">This court may feel that the ruling of the district court in failing to remit was severe or even harsh, but unless we conclude that such action was arbitrary and capricious, we are not at liberty to grant any relief \u2014 \u2022 any more than we could change the sentence here imposed on the defendant, which falls within the statutory limit, even though we might feel it excessive.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-6\">Nor do we think the government was under any obligation to produce evidence to show even approximately the total amount of expenses caused by defendant\u2019s default. The court might well have directed an inquiry on this subject, but was under no obligation to do so. The terms of the bond were definite: \u201c * * * but if the defendant fails to perform this condition payment of the amount of the bond shall be due forthwith.\u201d The bond is a contract between the surety and the government that if the latter will release the principal from custody the surety will undertake that the principal will appear personally at any specified time and place to answer. Upon the failure of the principal to so appear, the surety becomes the absolute debtor of the United States for the amount of the penalty. United States v. Hickman, 7 Cir., 155 F.2d 897. Appellant\u2019s husband must accept the hazards of his occupation. When he writes a bond he assumes the great risk involved if his faith is misplaced in the person who executes the bond as principal. Under the facts of this case the surety must be considered in the same category as her husband, who carried on the negotiations for the bond and who received the $500 premium. Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b680-6\">. Statement by Hon.
