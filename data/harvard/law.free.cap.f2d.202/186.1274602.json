It reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b243-7\">\u201cIs Charlotte A Second-Class City?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b243-8\">\u201cYou might think so from the kind of Television programs being presented by the Jefferson Standard Broadcasting Co. over WBTV. Have you seen one of their television programs lately? Did you know that all the programs presented over WBTV are on film and may be from one day to five years old? There are no local programs presented by WBTV. You cannot receive the local baseball games, football games, or other local events because WBTV does not have the proper equipment to make these pickups. Cities like New York, Boston, Philadelphia, Washington receive such programs nightly. Why doesn\u2019t the Jefferson Standard Broadcasting Company purchase the needed equipment to bring you the same type of programs enjoyed by other leading American cities? Could it be that they consider Charlotte a second-class community and only entitled to the pictures now being presented to them?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b243-10\">\u201cWBTV Technicians\u201d <footnotemark>1</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"AzV\">In a complaint filed with the Board, the Local Union, representing the technicians, contended that publication and distribution of the handbill was a concerted activity protected by \u00a7 7 of the National Labor Relations Act, as amended,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and that the discharges were an unfair labor practice. The Board\u2019s Trial Examiner agreed. The Board, however, one member dissenting, reversed his decision. It excluded from protection the \u201csecond-class\u201d handbill phase of the \u201cotherwise concededly lawful and protected\u201d peaceful picketing sponsored by the Union. The Union now seeks modification of that part of the Board\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-11\">Despite the broad language of \u00a7 7, which assures employees the \u201cright to * * * engage in * * * concerted activities for the purpose of collective bargaining or other mutual aid or protection,\u201d certain activities are excluded from the Act\u2019s protective ambit. For example, the Act expressly prohibits jurisdictional strikes, secondary boycotts and strikes for recognition in defiance of a certified union.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> And the courts have denied protection to employees resorting to \u201cunlawful\u201d <em>means, e. g., </em>a strike in contravention of the purpose of the Act,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> in violation of a federal statute forbidding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>mutiny,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> or of local laws prohibiting acts of violence or seizure of property; <footnotemark>6</footnotemark> or seeking \u201cunlawful\u201d <em>objectives, e. g., </em>concerted action to force an employer to violate a federal statute.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The Board, with the approval of the House Committee of Conference handling the bill which became.the Labor Management Relations Act, \u201chas been consistently applying the principles established by the courts.\u201d <footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b244-4\">Protection under \u00a7 7 of the Act, then, is withdrawn only from those concerted activities which contravene either (a) specific provisions or basic policies of the Act or of' related federal statutes, or (b) specific rules of other federal or local law that is not incompatible with the Board\u2019s governing statute. The Supreme Court has indicated that \u201c[t]he conduct thus protected is lawful conduct.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> And Judge Learned Hand, in a case involving a union publication which severely criticized the employer\u2019s business dealings, said: \u201c[S]o long as the \u2018activity\u2019 is not unlawful, we can see no justification for making it the occasion for a discharge * * <footnotemark>10</footnotemark> More recently the Board in the Ploover Co. case reiterated the correct rule when it declared that it is \u201cnot free * * .* to measure concerted activity in terms of whether the conduct is-wise or fair, or satisfies standards which we think desirable.\u201d <footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b244-17\">The Board properly applied this-rule to the extent that it found that the <em>objective </em>of the \u201csecond-class\u201d handbill \u201c \u2014 to-extract a concession from the employer with respect to the terms of their employment \u2014 was lawful.\u201d <footnotemark><em>12</em></footnotemark><em> </em>But the Board did not apply this rule to the handbill as a <em>means </em>for achieving that objective.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Instead of determining the legality or illegality of the use of the handbill, it only found that, unlike other handbills used in the dispute which were signed by the Union and made reference to the pending negotiations, this one was \u201chardly less <em>\u2018indefensible </em>than acts of physical sabotage\u201d <footnotemark>14</footnotemark> \u2014 apparently primarily because its purpose was undisclosed on its face.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> It denied protection under \u00a7 7, saying that \u201cthe gist of their appeal to the public was that the employer ought to be boycotted because he offered a shoddy product to the consuming public\u2014 not because he was \u2018unfair\u2019 to the employees who worked on that product.\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> By giving \u201cindefensible\u201d a vague content different from \u201cunlawful,\"<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> the Board <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>misconceived the scope of the established rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-4\">We think the Board failed to make the finding essential to its conclusion that the concerted activity was unprotected. Sound practice in judicial review of administrative orders precludes this court from determining \u201cunlawfulness\u201d without a pri- or consideration and finding hy the Board.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Since the initial judgment is within the province of the Board, the petition for</p>\n<p id=\"Ajt\">modification and enforcement of that part of the order before the court is denied, and the case is remanded<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> to the Board for further proceedings not inconsistent with 0pini0n_</p>\n<p id=\"AHk\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b243-12\">.

Wisconsin Employment Relations Board, 1949, 336 U.S. 245, 69 S.Ct. 516, 522, 93 L.Ed. 651; Harnischfeger Corp., 9 N.L.R.B. 676 (1938); and Elk Lumber Co., 91 N.L.R.B. 333 (1950), only those cases mentioned in notes 4-7, supra. In the U.A.W. case, the Supreme Court, merely by way of 'illustrating that not all concerted activities are protected by \u00a7 7 of the Act, quoted the following dictum from an early Board decision: \u201cThe question before us is, we think, whether [the] particular activity was so <em>in defensible, </em>under the circumstances, as to warrant the temployer] under the Act, in discharging the [employees] for this tyne of union activity.\u201d Harnischfeger Corp., 9 N.L.R.B. 676, 086 (1938) (emphasis supplied). The Board\u2019s argument in the instant case suggests that the Supreme Court thereby gave approval to withdrawing the protection of the Act where a concerted activity was lawful as to means and objectives. But as we read the U.A.W. case, so far as pertinent here, the Supreme Court held that the Wisconsin statute prohibiting certain concerted activity which was neither forbidden nor legalized by the Labor Management Relations Act was not in conflict with that Act. Applied to the instant case, it would mean that a concerted activity violating valid state law will not be protected by \u00a7 7 of the Act. Id. at 255 et seq. Thus the Supreme Court gave no broader meaning to \u201cindefensible\u201d then \u201cunlawful.\u201d That the Court was thinking in terms of \u201clawful\u201d and \u201cunlawful\u201d as the underlying criteria for the application of protection under the Act is clearly demonstrated. It said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b245-8\">\u201c * * # No longer can any state, as to relations within reach of the Act, treat otherwise lawful activities to aid unionization as an illegal conspiracy merely because they are undertaken by many persons acting in concert. But because legal conduct may not be made illegal by concert, it does not mean that otherwise illegal action is made legal by concert.\" 336 U.S. at page 258, 09 S.Ct. at page 523.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b245-10\">Nor can we accept the Board\u2019s decision in the Elk Lumber case to support its view in the instant case. For in Elk, as here, the Board found a concerted activity for a \u201clawful\u201d objective unprotected without finding the means \u201cunlawful.\u201d For a discussion raising other doubts on the reasoning in the Elk case,, see Note, 60 Yale L.J. 529 (1951).</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b245-12\">.
