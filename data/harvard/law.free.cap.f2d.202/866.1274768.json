Probably because the trial judge ruled against plaintiff\u2019s legal contentions, some of the facts were not too clearly found.</p>\n<p id=\"b923-14\">1. So far as we can now tell, there were instances of the following kind:</p>\n<p id=\"b923-15\">(a). The plaintiff, engaged in selling chewing-gum, made a contract with a ballplayer providing that plaintiff for a stated term should have the exclusive right to use the ball-player\u2019s photograph in connection with the sales of plaintiff\u2019s gum; the ball-player agreed not to grant any other gum manufacturer a similar right during such term; the contract gave plaintiff an option to extend the term for a designated period.</p>\n<p id=\"b923-20\">(b). Defendant, a rival chewing-gum manufacturer, knowing of plaintiff\u2019s contract, deliberately induced the ball-player to authorize defendant, by a contract with defendant, to use the player\u2019s photograph in connection with the sales of defendant\u2019s gum either during the original or extended term of plaintiff\u2019s contract, and defendant did so use the photograph.</p>\n<p id=\"b923-21\">Defendant argues that, even if such facts are proved, they show no actionable wrong, for this reason: The contract with plaintiff was no more than a release by the ballplayer to plaintiff of the liability which, absent the release, plaintiff would have incurred in using the ball-player\u2019s photograph, because such a use, without his consent, would be an invasion of his right of privacy under Section SO and Section SI of the New York Civil Rights Law; this statutory right of privacy is personal, not assignable; therefore, plaintiff\u2019s contract vested in plaintiff no \u201cproperty\u201d right or other legal interest which defendant\u2019s conduct invaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b923-22\">Both parties agree, and so do we, that, on the facts here, New York \u201claw\u201d governs. And we shall assume, for the moment, that, under the New York decisions, defendant correctly asserts that any such contract between plaintiff and a ballplayer, in so far as it merely authorized plaintiff to use the player\u2019s photograph, created nothing but a release of liability. On that basis, were there no more to the contract, plaintiff would have no actionable claim against defendant. But defendant\u2019s argument neglects the fact that, in the contract, the ball-player also promised not to give similar releases to others. If defend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"868\">*868</page-number>ant, knowing of the contract, deliberately induced the ball-play\u00e9r to break that promise, _ defendant behaved tortiously.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> See, e. g., Hornstein v. Podwitz, 254 N.Y. 443, 173 N.E. 674, 84 A.L.R. 1; 6 Corbin, Contracts (1951) Sec. 1470.</p>\n<p id=\"b924-4\">Some of defendant\u2019s contracts were obtained by it through its agent, Players Enterprise, Inc; others were obtained by Russell Publishing Co., acting independently, and were then assigned by Russ'ell to defendant. Since Players acted as defendant\u2019s agent, defendant is liable for any breach of plaintiff\u2019s contracts thus induced by Players. However, as Russell did not act as defendant\u2019s agent when Russell, having knowledge of plaintiff\u2019s contract with a player, by subsequently contracting with that player, induced a breach of plaintiff\u2019s contract, defendant is not liable for any breach so induced; nor did there arise such a liability against defendant for such an induced breach when defendant became the assignee of one of those Russell contracts.</p>\n<p id=\"b924-5\">2. The foregoing covers the situations where defendant, by itself or through its agent, induced breaches. But in those instances where Russell induced the breach, we have a different problem; and that problem also confronts us in instances\u2014 alleged in one paragraph of the complaint and to which the trial judge in his opinion also (although not altogether clearly) refers \u2014 where defendant, \u201cwith knowledge of plaintiff\u2019s exclusive rights,\u201d used a photograph of a ball-player without his consent\u00bb during the term of his contract with plaintiff.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> \u25a0 '</p>\n<p id=\"b924-6\">With regard to such situations, we must consider defendant\u2019s contention that none of plaintiff\u2019s contracts created more than a release of liability, because a man has no legal interest in the publication of his picture other than his right of privacy, <em>i. e., </em>a personal and non-assignable right not to have his feelings hurt by such a publication.</p>\n<p id=\"b924-9\">A majority of this court rejects this contention. We think, that, in addition to and independent of that right of privacy (which in New York derives from statute), a man has a -right in the publicity value of his photograph, <em>i. e., </em>the right to grant the exclusive privilege of publishing his picture, and that such a grant may validly be made \u201cin gross,\u201d <em>i. e., </em>without an accompanying transfer of a business or of anything else. Whether it be labelled a \"property\u201d right is immaterial; for here, as often elsewhere, the tag \u201cproperty\u201d simply symbolizes the fact that courts enforce a claim which has pecuniary worth.</p>\n<p id=\"b924-10\">This right might be called a \u201cright of publicity.\u201d For it is common knowledge that many prominent persons (especially actors and ball-players), far from having their feelings bruised through public exposure of their likenesses, would feel sorely deprived if they no longer received money for authorizing advertisements, popularizing their countenances, displayed in newspapers, magazines, busses, trains and subways. This right of publicity would usually yield them no money unless it could be made the subject of an exclusive grant which barred any other advertiser from using their pictures.</p>\n<p id=\"b924-11\">We think the New York decisions recognize such a right. See, e. g., Wood v. Lucy, Lady Duff Gordon, 222 N.Y. 88, 118 N.E. 214; Madison Square Garden Corp. v. Universal Pictures Co., 255 App.Div. 459, 465, 7 N.Y.S.2d 845; Cf. Liebig\u2019s Extract of Meat Co. v. Liebig Extract Co., 2 Cir., 180 F. 688.</p>\n<p id=\"b924-12\">We think Pekas Co., Inc. v. Leslie, 52 N.Y.L.J.1864, decided in 1915 by Justice Greenbaum sitting in the Supreme Court Term, is not controlling since \u2014 apart from a doubt as to whether an opinion of that court must be taken by us as an authoritative exposition of New York law \u2014 the opinion shows that the judge had his attention directed by plaintiff exclusively to Sections <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"869\">*869</page-number>50 and 51 of the New York statute, and, accordingly, held that the right of privacy was \u201cpurely personal and not assignable\u201d because \u201crights for outraged feelings are no more assignable than would be a claim arising from a libelous utterance.\u201d We do not agree with Hanna Mfg. Co. v. Hillerich &amp; Bradsby Co., 5 Cir., 78 F.2d 763, 101 A.L.R. 484; see adverse comments on that decision in 36 Col.Law Rev. (1936) 502, 49 Harv.Law Rev. (1936) 496, and 45 Yale L.J. (1936) 520. <footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b925-5\">We said above that defendant was not liable for a breach of any of plaintiff\u2019s contracts induced by Russell, and did not become thus liable (for an induced breach) when there was assigned to defendant a contract between Russell and a ball-player, although Russell, in making that contract, knowingly induced a breach of a contract with plaintiff. But plaintiff, in its capacity as exclusive grantee of a player\u2019s \u201cright of publicity,\u201d has a valid claim against defendant if defendant used that player\u2019s photograph during the term of plaintiff\u2019s grant and with knowledge of it. It is no defense to such a claim that defendant is the assignee of a subsequent contract between that player and Russell, purporting to make a grant to Russell or its assignees. For the prior grant to plaintiff renders that subsequent grant invalid during the period of the grant (including an exercised option) to plaintiff, but not thereafter.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b925-6\">3. We must remand to the trial court for a determination (on the basis of the present record and of further evidence introduced by either party) of these facts: (1) the date and contents of each of plaintiff\u2019s contracts, and whether plaintiff exercised its option to renew; (2) defendant\u2019s or Players\u2019 conduct with respect to each such contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-7\">Of course, if defendant made a contract with a ball-player which was not executed \u2014 \u25a0 or which did not authorize defendant to use the player\u2019s photograph \u2014 until the expiration of the original or extended term of plaintiff\u2019s contract with that player, or which did not induce a breach of the agreement to renew, then defendant did. no legal wrong to plaintiff. The same is true of instances where neither defendant nor Players induced a breach of plaintiff\u2019s contract, and defendant did not use the player\u2019s photograph until after the expiration of such original or extended or option term.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-11\">If, upon further exploration of the facts, the trial court, in the light of our opinion, concludes that defendant is liable, it will, of course, ascertain damages and decide what equitable relief is justified.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-12\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b923-16\">. Plaintiff abandoned its appeal from the dismissal of that part of the complaint asserting unfair competition and trademark infringement. Defendant has abandoned its cross-appeal from the dismissal of its counterclaim.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b924-7\">. Defendant is also liable if be thus induced any player to breach his contract to renew.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b924-13\">. Oil the remand, the judge should make tradings on this subject, on the bsais of the evidence now in the record and such additional evidence as the parties may introduce.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b925-8\">. It should ho noted that the Hanna ease was a pre-Erie-Tompkins decision, which, although it discussed the New York decisions, did not purport to decide authoritatively the New York \u201claw\u201d on the subject.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b925-9\">. Since plaintiff asserts that, in all instances, defendant acted with knowledge of plaintiff\u2019s contracts, we need not consider whether and how far defendant would be liable to plaintiff, absent such knowledge, when, during the term of plaintiff\u2019s contract, defendant used a player\u2019s photograph without inducing a breach of that contract.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b925-13\">SWAN, Chief Judge</author>\n<p id=\"arf-dedup-0\">(concurring in part).</p>\n<p id=\"b925-14\">I agree that the cause should he reversed and remanded, and I concur in so much of the opinion as deals with the defendant\u2019s liability for intentionally inducing a ball-player to breach a contract which gave plaintiff the exclusive privilege of using his picture.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"rehearing\">\n<p id=\"b925-15\">On Defendant\u2019s Petition for Rehearing</p>\n<author id=\"afd-dedup-0\">PER CURIAM.</author>\n<p id=\"b925-16\">1. In our original opinion, footnote 1, we said that defendant had \u201cabandoned its cross-appeal from dismissal of its counterclaim.\u201d But we are now satisfied that defendant had preserved its cross-appeal on the issue of impairment of its own contract rights. Therefore, if plaintiff induced breaches of exclusive agreements which defendant had made with ball-players, defendant is entitled to relief against plaintiff. Accordingly, we add the following to our mandate as additional items for determination by the trial court: (3) The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"870\">*870</page-number>date and contents of each of defendant\u2019s contracts under which defendant claims,. and whether defendant exercised \u2019its option to renew, and (4) plaintiffs conduct with respect to each such contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b926-4\">2. The last sentence under point 2 of our opinion might suggest that, as long as one of the parties had a contract with a ball-player giving it exclusive rights, any subsequent contract made between that player and the other party before expiration of the prior rights is necessarily invalid. This point appears to require' further clarificaton. Certainly, if the terms of one party\u2019s contract provide that its rights shall go into effect only upon expiration of a prior grantee\u2019s exclusive rights, the later grant would become fully effective at the time of such expiration. Indeed, in this situation no tort has been committed. However, the problem becomes more complex where the subsequent contract, by its terms, purports to go <em>into effect </em>before termination of any prior exclusive rights. Where the party soliciting such a subsequent contract knows of the prior rights and actually proceeds to use the grant given in violation thereof, its contract is tainted with illegality and is utterly invalid. See Reiner v. North American Newspaper Alliance, 259 N.Y. 250, 181 N.E. 561, 83 A.L.R. 23. Hence such a contract would convey no rights even if it ran beyond the duration of the other party\u2019s prior rights. But where the subsequent solicitor treated its contract as if it \u00a1became effective only upon expiration of any prior rights and made no effort to use the grant before then, that grant would bloom into full force as soon as the earlier rights expired. The same is true , if the subsequent grantee did not know at the time he entered into his contract that the ball-player had already given exclusive rights to another party. The validity of one party\u2019s contracts beyond the expiration date of prior exclusive rights given the other will thus depend on the district court\u2019s findings of fact as to the considerations we have pointed out.</p>\n<p id=\"b926-6\">On Plaintiff\u2019s Motion for a Stay</p>\n<p id=\"b926-7\">We deny plaintiff\u2019s motion for a temporary stay. But we have directed that our mandate shall issue forthwith in order that the trial court may immediately entertain a motion by either party for a temporary injunction.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Because of the seasonal character of the business here involved, the taking of evidence on such a motion should be conducted, and the decision should be made, with the utmost dispatch. Without intimating what the decision should be, it may be suggested that the trial judge in his discretion (1) may think it advisable at once to require that a party desiring to avoid being enjoined shall give a bond in a substantial amount, and (2) may deem it wise to issue a series of temporary injunctions, <em>i.e., </em>to enjoin th\u00e9 use by one party of a particular player\u2019s picture as and when the exclusive right of the other party to the use of such picture is established by the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b926-8\">On Defendant\u2019s Motion to Stay Mandate and Plaintiff\u2019s Motion to Award It Appellate Costs</p>\n<p id=\"b926-9\">PER CURIAM:</p>\n<p id=\"b926-10\">The motion for stay of mandate is denied and the Clerk of the Court is directed to issue the mandate forthwith.</p>\n<p id=\"b926-11\">Costs of appeal are awarded to the plaintiff-appellant, with the exception of the item for printing the Transcript of Record. As to this item only one-half the cost of printing is awarded inasmuch as it contains a great deal of matter unnecessary for adequate presentation of the questions raised by the appeal.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b926-12\">. We have denied defendant\u2019s motion for a stay pending action by the Supreme Court on a petition for certiorari.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
