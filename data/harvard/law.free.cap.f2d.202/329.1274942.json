MILLER, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b385-28\">A jury in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia found Albert Allen and Frank Proctor guilty of killing another while perpetrating a robbery, which is murder in the first degree.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We are concerned only with Albert Allen, who appeals from the death sentence imposed upon him.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-29\">The murdered man was George Schotn-ber, known to his fellow employees at the Uline Ice Company as \u201cOatmeal.\u201d At 5:30 p. m. on Saturday, December 30, 1950, the superintendent sent Schombcr on his last trip of the day as the driver of a special delivery truck. Less than an hour later he was found in the Uline garage, slumped behind the steering wheel of his truck. He was bleeding profusely from a wound between the eyes, and from his nose, ears and mouth. Blood was on his clothes, his face and hands. He died in a hospital at 1:20 a. m. the following morning, Sunday, December 31,- 1950. Although Schomber had cashed his pay check for $53.61, which he had received at noon, and had collected <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>more than $70.00 from customers, the police found on his person only an empty pay envelope, a delivery book and a few cents in change.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-4\">The appel\u2019ant, Albert Allen, was employed by the Uline Ice Company as a truck driver and ice cube cutter. He finished work at noon on Saturday, December 30, 1950, and at about 5:30 p. m. was at the corner of 9th and 0 Streets, N. W., with Trank Proctor, his friend and later his co-defendant. 'They went in a cab to a delicatessen across the street from the Uline garage and then -fell in company with \u25a0George Boddie, another Uline employee. At a nearby liquor store Boddie bought whiskey, which the three consumed in an alley.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-5\">Soon after, Allen and Proctor entered the garage and awaited the return of Oatmeal, who, as a C.O.D. driver, would be apt to have money \u2022 on his person. They prepared for him by breaking the handle of a push broom, thus obtaining an adequate weapon. When Oatmeal came in, probably about 6:00 p. m., the club was used with fatal effect. Taking the victim\u2019s wallet, they left the scene, divided the money, and threw the wallet in a sewer at 3rd and M Streets, N. E., from which it was later recovered by the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-20\">Sunday morning, December 31, 1950, Allen went to work at the usual time and soon learned that Oatmeal was dead. He saw two police officers in conversation with his foreman, and was later told by the latter the management had been instructed to notify the police of any employees who were absent from work.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-21\">On Monday, January 1, 1951, Al\u2019en again went to work as usual'. About 11:00 a. m. he drove his truck to 9th and O Streets, where he had a talk with Proctor and told him of Oatmeal\u2019s death. They had a second conversation at the same corner that same evening after Allen had finished work.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>Alarmed because Proctor, who struck the fatal blows, was not disposed to suffer the consequences alone, Allen decided to protect himself by talking to the police and throwing all the blame on his friend. To that end he deliberately stayed away from work the next morning \u2014 Tuesday, January 2 \u2014 in the hope the police woul'd come to his house to interrogate him, as his foreman had told him they would do. He waited until 9:30 a. m., but the officers did not come. Then he went to 9th and O Streets, had another talk with Proctor,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and proceeded to the Uline plant, where he arrived' <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>a few minutes affer 10:00 a. m. Several police officers were there systematically interviewing the Uline employees, a task they had begun on Monday afternoon.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-4\">Although he had not been called, Allen awaited his turn and was admitted about noon. He told- several untruths as to his whereabouts Saturday night, and, as he put it, \u201cI told him some things I had done that I hadn\u2019t done, and I didn\u2019t have enough time to do them.\u201d Apparently he was not quite ready to accuse Proctor. Later, probably about 3:00 p. m., Allen went to headquarters with two officers, making two stops on the way to pick up the shoes and clothing he had worn the previous Saturday. In a test made in his presence, a police chemist found bloodstains on his coat. Allen explained by saying his girl friend struck him and caused his nose to -bleed. At 4:00 p. m. Allen told Sergeant Furr he was in the Uline garage Saturday evening, saw the assault on Oatmeal, and could lead him to the guilty man. They drove to 9th and O Streets where he pointed out Proctor, who was immediately taken to headquarters.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-5\">Beginning at about 7:30 p. m. Allen made a full and detailed confession. When it had been reduced to writing and -read back to him, he indicated one correction, which was made by the typist and initialed by him, after which he signed the document. Later he repeated his confession to certain Uline employees who had been called. We reproduce here a small portion of the written confession, which is enough to show in broad outline how he said the crime was committed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b388-6\">\u201cI have been knowing Frank Proctor for about a year by seeing him on the corner' of 9th &amp; O Streets, N. W. and drinking together. On the Saturday before last, that was on December 23rd, I met Frank at 9th &amp; O Sts., N. W., and he asked me did I know where he could get some money and I told him yes and I gave him the address of the Uline Ice Company. I told him to come over about 5:30 P.M. and I would be there, but he didn\u2019t come over. I saw him several times after that but he didn\u2019t say anything about it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b388-10\">\u201cThen on Saturday, December 30th, I saw him again on the corner of 9th &amp; O Sts., N. W. about 5:00 P.M. and he wanted to know if the job was still good. I told him yes. We walked on down 9th Street to 9th &amp; N. We went in the whiskey store and bought a half pint. We came out and caught a -cab. We goes over to 3rd &amp; L, N. E. We gets out of the cab and walks up to 3rd &amp; M and then we came back to 3rd &amp; L. On the way back we saw George Schomber, who we call \u2018Oatmeal\u2019 loading a truck. I told Frank there was Oatmeal loading a truck now.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b388-12\">\u201cWe walks on in front of the garage and Dorsey and Holmes was going in the garage .in their trucks. George Boddie he jumped off of Holmes\u2019 truck and yelled for me to wait. I waited for Boddie and he -comes on down the street. We goes to the whiskey store at 3rd &amp; K. George Boddie buys a half pint and we goes in the alley and drink it. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b388-13\">\u201cThen we saw Ben, who is the janitor at Ulines, pull into the garage with the Coupe. Then Ben left out of the garage and went into the office, and then me and Frank went into the garage through the small door. We went back there in the back on the left hand side, where the trash barrels are kept, and Frank picks up a broom that was sitting beside the trash cans. It was a push broom with wooden handle. Frank picks up the broom and takes the handle out of it and tells me to stand up on the handle and break it in two. He held the handle and I stepped on it and broke it. Then he lays the handle down and says \u2018It\u2019s too light.\u2019 Then he picks up the broom and holds it until Oatmeal comes in.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b389-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>\u201cOatmeal pulls up to the gate and raised the gate on the garage and he came in with his truck. He parks his truck and gets out with a newspaper and a lunch box in his hand. Frank walks around behind him and hit him over the head twice. Then he drug him around the right hand side of his truck, looks in his pocket and gets his billfold and kicks him in the face twice. Then I let the door down and we went out.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b389-5\">Proctor also confessed soon after arriving at headquarters. Both were then taken to the Uline garage where they re-enacted the' crime in the presence of police and other witnesses. There was some dispute between them as to whether Allen had struck Oatmeal. On Wednesday, January 3. after a hearing, the coroner held Allen to await grand jury action. This was equivalent to a hearing before a committing magistrate.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The next day, Allen confessed again, according to the Superintendent of Classification at the District Jail, who testified that in a conversation on Thursday, January 4, Albert Allen told him Frank Proctor had asked him about a week before the murder where he could get some money and that he told Proctor that Oatmeal was the only C.O.D. driver at Uline\u2019s; that on Saturday, December 30, he and Proctor went to the garage and, when Oatmeal came in, Proctor hit him twice with a push broom handle, took his money, and kicked him twice on the head.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-16\">Testifying in his own behalf, Allen did not categorically deny that he had planned the crime, that he was present in the garage aiding in the assault and robbery, and that he and Proctor divided the money. He was content to say what he had told the police was untrue. He did not deny making the admission to the jail official on Wednesday January 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-17\">This is an unusual confession case in that the appellant did not testify that his confession was elicited by physical or psychological torture or by any sort of pressure. Nor did he testify that he was caused to admit his guilt by the fact that he was in the presence of the police or was being detained by them. To the contrary, he said from the witness stand the officers treated him \u201cfine\u201d and \u201cwith great respect.\u201d He insisted many times that he was not mistreated in any way during the interviews with the police.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> that he voluntarily went to them in the first place, and then went with them to headquarters and voluntarily gave them information. He \u201cdecided\u201d to point out Proctor as the murderer.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-18\">Allen asks us to reverse his conviction on the theory that his confession was inadmissible because it came after he had been illegally detained by the police from noon until 7:30 p. m. without being taken before a committing magistrate. Pie did not state from the witness stand, nor does he now assert, that his admissions were induced by the fact he was in custody. Pie simply says that under the McNabb ruling <footnotemark>6</footnotemark> a con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>fession is inadmissible if made during unnecessary delay in taking the -prisoner before a committing official, and that this is true regardless of whether the prisoner\u2019s detention had the psychological effect of causing him to confess.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-4\">For the reasons stated in Pierce v. States, <em>91 </em>U.S.App.D.C. 19, 197 F.2d 189, we think the McNabb rule, as amplified in Upshaw v. United States, 1948, 335 U.S. 410, 69 S.Ct. 170, 93 L.Ed. 100, and other decisions, is that illegal detention before presentment to a. committing magistrate, standing alone and without more, does not invalidate a confession made during its continuance, unless the detention produced the disclosure. So we cannot accept Allen\u2019s contention that his illegal detention \u2014 if it was illegal \u2014 invalidated his confession regardless of whether it produced it. The question then becomes (assuming for the discussion, without deciding, that he was unlawfully detained) whether his illegal detention must be presumed to have been coercion which caused him to confess, even though he did not attribute to it that coercive effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-7\">There may be circumstances in which the court should, without proof, conclude a prisoner\u2019s confession was the fruit of unlawful detention and therefore should not be received in evidence. But the presumption that the prisoner\u2019s detention elicited the confession. should not be indulged when, as in this case, the defendant\u2019s testimony describes a quite different motive which caused him to tell his story to the police. Allen\u2019s account of his three conversations with Proctor on Monday and Tuesday shows his reason for -confessing: he was attempting to forestall an accusation by Proctor that he had committed murder. That such was his purpose, formed after the first two conversations with Proctor on Monday, is demonstrated, not only by the substance of those conversations, but also by his behavior on Tuesday morning when he absented himself from work to invite questioning by the police; and when, after a third and final conversation with Proctor, he went immediately and uninvited to the Uline office to talk about the -crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-8\">It is therefore our view, not only that Allen disclaimed unlawful detention or any other sort of pressure as the motivation of his confession, but also that he stated the real motive which prompted it, \u2014 a motive unrelated to the fact that he was in custody. Consequently, we think the confession, which was not otherwise attacked, was admissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-9\">Another ground for reversal relied on by the appellant is the denial of his motion for a severance. On the second day of the trial, although before any evidence had been introduced, both defendants asked a severance on the ground that their defenses were inconsistent, without pointing out to the court where the inconsistency lay. \u201cIt is the general rule that persons jointly indic.ted should be tried together, and granting separate trials is a matter of discretion.\u201d Hall v. United States, 83 U.S.App.D.C. 166, 168, 168 F.2d 161, 163, 4 A.L.R.2d 1193, certiorari denied, 1948, 334 U.S. 853, 68 S.Ct. 1509, 92 L.Ed. 1775. In Dauer v. United States, 10 Cir., 1951, 189 F.2d 343, 344, certiorari denied, 342 U.S. 898, 72 S.Ct. 232, it was said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"af-dedup-0\">\u201c * * * The mere fact that there is hostility between defendants or that one may try to save himself at the expense of another is in itself alone not sufficient grounds to require separate trials. It is only when the situation is such that the exercise of common sense and sound judicial judgment should lead one to conclude that one defendant cannot have a fair trial, as that term is understood in law, that a severance should be granted.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b390-10\">The District Court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to grant a severance. Nor was discretion abused in denying Allen\u2019s motion for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-11\">The appellant also says the court erred in permitting the District Jail official to testify concerning Allen\u2019s admission of guilt made to him on January 4. This was plainly competent.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-12\">We have considered carefully each point advanced by the appellant and in addition we have studied the entire record to see if prejudicial error occurred which was not pointed out by the appellant. We found <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>none. The district judge conducted the trial in a mJi s painstaking way and exhibited throiW-'iout a meticulous concern for the right^of appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b385-31\">.
