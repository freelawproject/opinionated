Pursuant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>to \u00a7 11, the Commission issued the regulations under attack here.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> These provide for (1) the \u201cseparation\u201d of hearing examiners by the Commission\u2019s standard reduction in force procedures; <footnotemark>5</footnotemark> (2) the classification by the Commission of hearing examiner positions within an agency according to the level of difficulty of cases which examiners filling these positions will handle; (3) the assignment of cases by the agencies to hearing examiners on these various levels, according to the difficulty of the case; and (4) the promotion by the Commission of hearing examiners within an agency from one grade to another. Each of these regulations is held by the trial court<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and this court to be invalid because it falls outside the scope of the governing statute. I disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-5\">The basis for the contention that hearing examiners are insulated from reductions in force is the provision in \u00a7 11 of the Administrative Procedure Act that \u201cExaminers shall be removable by the agency in which they are employed <em>only for good cause </em>established and determined by the Civil Service Commission * * (Emphasis supplied.) It is said that this language evidences a congressional intent to shelter hearing examiners from agency action designed to meet such ordinary exigencies as lack of funds, personnel ceilings and decreases in the amount of work an agency has to handle.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> \u201cGood cause,\u201d under this view, means no more than \u201ca <em>personal </em>shortcoming \u2014 mal feasance, incompetence, or some kindred disqualification * * <footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and hearing examiners can be removed \u201conly\u201d for such a reason.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-14\">The \u201c[sjtrong reason [which] would be essential to support so strange a conclusion\u201d <footnotemark>9</footnotemark> does not exist. Congress put \u201cthe entire tradition of the Civil Service Commission * * * to use\u201d <footnotemark>10</footnotemark> when it prescribed a new system of tenure for hearing examiners in \u00a7 11. An integral part of that \u201ctradition\u201d is that federal employees are subject to reductions in force.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Commission criteria for determining how a reduction in force should be accomplished are now a firmly embedded implementation of that \u201ctradition.\u201d <footnotemark><em>12</em></footnotemark><em> </em>It surpasses the bounds of reasonable inference to suppose that Congress, without explicitly saying so, intended to abandon this \u201ctradition\u201d in order to immunize hearing examiners from reductions in force.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Where Congress did mean to change certain \u201ctraditions\u201d and practices existing at the time the Administrative Procedure Act was passed, it did not flounder in a sea of indirection.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b369-16\">The classification, rotation and promotion regulations are so closely tied that, as a practical matter, they require joint consideration. The classification regulations set up a system of grade classifications for hearing examiners which describe the qualifications of the examiners for each grade and specify the kind of proceedings in which examiners of a given grade shall <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>preside.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Hearing examiner positions \u00a1lave been allocated by the Commission to the various agencies according to this general plan. For some agencies, the Commission has determined that all the positions allocated shall be at the same grade; in other agencies, it has determined that there shall be as many as five grades.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> The allocation of several grades to a given agency is based upon the Commission\u2019s determination that the cases at which hearing examiners preside in that agency vary considerably in difficulty and importance. The rotation regulations provide that \u201cInsofar as practicable, examiners shall be assigned in rotation to cases <em>of the level of difficulty and importance that are normally assigned to positions of the salary grade they </em>hold.\"<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> This contemplates that the agency will classify cases before hearing, assigning the more difficult and important ones, for example, to examiners with higher grades. Finally, the promotion regulations authorize and establish a procedure for the .promotion of individual hearing examiners by the Commission from one grade to another within the agency. The agency may elect to fill a vacancy by promotion, either from the ranks of its own examiners or from the ranks of other agency personnel. If the agency elects the former group, the Commission alone selects the individual therefrom and the agency is bound by the Commission\u2019s choice. If, on the other hand, the agency elects the latter group, it can select the individual therefrom but the Commission may exercise a veto power over such choice.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-4\">Briefly stated, the substance of the broadside attack on the regulations is this: \u00a7 11 of the Administrative Procedure Act requires that hearing examiners \u201cshall be assigned to cases in rotation so far as practicable * * Appellees read this to mean that cases assigned for hearing within an agency shall, in effect', be docketed regardless of their complexity; that a hearing examiner, as he finishes one task, will simply be given whatever case happens to be next in line;<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> that since all the examiners within a given agency will be doing the same work, any difference in grade classification and pay would be not only unfair, but illegal;<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> and that since all the examiners within a given agency will be of the same rank, there will be no occasion for individual promotions within the agency.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Underlying this construction of the Act is the notion that classification, rotation according to case difficulty and individual intra-agency promotions will give the agencies control over hearing examiners\u2019 ccgnpensation and thus destroy that independence from agency control which Congress intended the Administrative Procedure Act to assure hearing examiners.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-11\">Appellees\u2019 view, which is adopted by the court, goes much farther along the road toward complete examiner independence than Congress itself was willing to travel. In enacting \u00a7 11, Congress sought to strike a balance between the need for administrative efficiency and expertise and the need for freeing hearing examiners from dictation or intimidation by the agencies. Accordingly, Congress did not adopt any of the extreme proposals to isolate hearing examiners from the agencies or insulate them completely from expressions of the agencies\u2019 views. For example, it rejected the idea of a completely separate Government-wide \u201cpool\u201d of hearing examiners which some experts had favored.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> And <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>it turned down another proposal for greater autonomy than \u00a7 11 provides \u201cchiefly on the ground that it will remove the examiners from real responsibility to the agency charged with the administration of law.\u201d <footnotemark>22</footnotemark> Instead, Congress adopted the less extreme proposal of removing from the agencies and giving to the Commission wide powers over the selection, compensation and removal of hearing examiners. This was the means adopted to end \u201cthe present situation, in which examiners are mere employees of an agency.\u201d <footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b371-4\">1 cannot find in the simple congressional directive of assignment \u201cto cases in rotation so far as practicable * * * \u201d an intent to enact appellees\u2019 far-reaching proposals. Freezing all examiners within an agency into one grade and mechanical assignment of cases would go a long way toward dissipating the administrative expertise upon which courts now rely in giving deference to administrative judgments.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> For usually it is through long experience in a particular field that expertness is acquired. Yet under the appellees\u2019 view, specialization by hearing examiners would depend, in large part, upon chance in the assignment of cases. Anomalous results would follow. In the Civil Aeronautics Board, for example, an ex-pilot who has heard nothing but airman certificate cases might suddenly find himself at sea in an intricate corporate control relationship case under \u00a7 408 of the Civil Aeronautics Act.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> And a freshman Interstate Commerce Commission hearing examiner who has dealt only with simple route extensions might be saddled with the great responsibility of a rate-making case with nation-wide implications.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-6\">The House Report on the Administrative Procedure Act, in referring to the rotation provision \u2014 the focal point of appellees\u2019 case \u2014 says that \u201cexaminers may be permitted to specialize and foe assigned mainly to cases for which they have so qualified.\u201d <footnotemark>26</footnotemark> And the Senate Report says that \u201cThe Commission <em>would exercise its powers by classifying examiners\u2019 positions and, </em>upon customary examination through its agents, <em>shift examiners to superior classifications or higher grades as their experience and duties may </em>require.\u201d<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> Taken together, these reports clearly recognize that individual ability and specialization were not to be abandoned as a part of the pattern of expertise so vital to the administrative process.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-11\">Moreover, the Attorney General\u2019s Committee on Administrative Procedure informed Congress before it passed the Administrative Procedure Act that many agencies employed hearing examiners in different grades and salaries. This was the situation in the Federal Communications Commission, United States Maritime Commission, National Labor Relations Board, Civil Aeronautics Authority and Interstate Commerce Commission, among others. Had Congress meant to change this well-established practice, I do not think it would have left it to conjecture. Such a basic change would only have required a simple direction that \u201call hearing examiners within an agency shall be of the same grade.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b371-12\">The validity of the promotion regulations necessarily follows from the power to classify hearing examiners and assign cases according to the level of difficulty. Ap-pellees contend that individual promotion of examiners within an agency is forbidden; that the Commission must authorize simultaneous promotion for all agency examiners. Under this view, individual promotion of examiners would be possible only <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>by obtaining a transfer to another agency having a higher grade classification. Thus, it would create an incentive for examiners to hop-skip from agency to agency in search of promotions. This would threaten administrative expertise in the same way as the uniform classification of hearing examiners within an agency and the mechanical assignment of cases. Testimony before Congress prior to the passage of the 'Administrative Procedure Act indicated the importance of expertise and that one way of developing a corps of expert hearing examiners in the Interstate Commerce Commission, for example, was to recruit examiners in lower grades and, as they grew in experience and competence, to advance them to higher hearing examiner grades within the agency. Although Congress meant to place restrictions upon the authority of the agencies themselves to effect these promotions, it did not prohibit the Civil Service Commission from making intra-agency promotions.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-4\">In sum, I do not think- that the regulations contravene \u00a7 11 of the Administrative Procedure Act. Whether these regulations are wise or could have been written differently is not a matter for our concern.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-5\">Much of the attack upon these regulations is leveled at the possibility they offer for frustrating the purpose of the Administrative Procedure Act to free hearing examiners from agency domination and coercion. That the possibility exists cannot be denied. But it is not so gross as to make the regulations invalid. I think we must assume, moreover, that Congress was amply aware of this possibility but that, in the light of the other considerations discussed above, it was unwilling to write the statute in such manner as to guarantee elimination of this possibility. Congress had a right to rely upon the administrators to keep faith with the spirit of the statute. The record in this case does not reveal that that confidence was misplaced. If individual instances of abuses should arise in the future which threaten to thwart the spirit of the statute, the means are available to put the matter right.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-6\">I would reverse the judgment of the District Court</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b368-15\">. 60 Stat. 237, 244, 5 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1010.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b368-16\">.
