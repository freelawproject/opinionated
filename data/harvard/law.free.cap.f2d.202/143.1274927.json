While the results in each of the cases have varied with the evidence offered in each and the effect given to that evidence by the trial judge, the governing principles applied in each have not varied. As laid down by us in Mitchell v. U. S., 5 Cir., 165 F.2d at page 760, these are:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b199-25\">\u201cThe cases are unanimous that in war-risk insurance cases involving change of beneficiary the courts will brush aside all legal technicalities in order to effectuate the manifest intent of the insured; and that if he manifests an intent to make a change and has done everything reasonably within his power to accomplish his purpose, leaving only ministerial acts to be performed by the insurer, the courts will treat that as done which ought to' have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>b\u00e9en done and give effect to the insured\u2019s intent. The cases are also unanimous that a mere intent to change a beneficiary is not enough. Such an intent must be followed by some affirmative act on the part of the insured evidencing an exercise of the right to change the beneficiary. Where the courts differ is as to the degree of affirmative action necessary to effect a change. Literal compliance with the provisions of a policy is never necessary.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b200-4\">The district judge, after a full trial, denied plaintiff\u2019s claim, and in a well thought out and carefully worded opinion,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> fully and accurately setting down and giving effect to the substantial facts of this case, gave his reasons for doing so.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-5\">W\u00e9 agree with his summary of the facts, his careful analysis of the decisions, and his conclusion that,- under the statute and regulations, the plaintiff\u2019s proof was insufficient to establish a change of beneficiary under any of our cases, including the Gann case on which appellant so strongly relies. So agreeing, we affirm his decision for the reasons that he gave.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b199-16\">.
