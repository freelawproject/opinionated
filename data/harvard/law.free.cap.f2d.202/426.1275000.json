The Republican Precinct Convention in that precinct was held on May 3, 1952 and all questions presented by this action are now clearly moot, except possibly the claim for damages. The claim for damages, certainly as of the date of the filing of the complaint before the convention was held, is not substantial, and does not merit the attention of the court. The appeal is, therefore, dismissed because the matter is moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-13\">Dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
