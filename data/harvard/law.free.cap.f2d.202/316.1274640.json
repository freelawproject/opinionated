When they registered for the draft in 1942 and again when they applied for passports to visit China in 1947 and 1948, respectively, both Chong and King falsely swore that they were United Slates citizens. Upon their return from China at the completion of their visits, they were detained at the port of entry pending investigation. The investigations revealed their perjury, for which they were subsequently indicted and convicted.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Thereafter, in 1949, they were found by boards of special inquiry<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> to be excludable and were \u201cordered deported to China.\u201d <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> These determinations were affirmed in administrative appeals. In each case, more than two years elapsed between detention at the port of entry and the date finally set for deportation.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-18\">The present disputes turn on the Attorney General\u2019s authority to order deportation to China. Appellants seek refuge in \u00a7, 23 of the Internal Security Act of 1950.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> That section amended \u00a7 20 of the Immigration Act of 1917<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> without widening the scope of its applicability except in a manner not pertinent here. It did authorize greater flexibility in the deportation of aliens and the places to which they could be returned. It also added this proviso:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b373-19\">\u201cThe deportation of aliens * * * shall be directed by the Attorney General to the country specified by the alien, if it is willing to accept him into its territory * * *. No alien shall be deported under any provisions of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>this chapter to any country in which th\u00e9 Attorney General shall find that such alien would be subjected to physical persecution.\u201d <footnotemark><em>7</em></footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b374-4\">Despite appellants\u2019 contentions that they would be subjected to physical persecution and. possibly even loss of life if they were to return to China, neither the Attorney General nor the District Court thought they were protected by amended \u00a7 20. Instead they thought these cases were goveraed by \u00a7 18 of the Act of 1917.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> That section, unlike amended \u00a7 20 or its predecessor, affords no alternative concerning the country to which the alien about to be deported should be sent. Nor does it contain the \u201cphysical persecution\u201d proviso whose protection these appellants seek.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-5\">As we interpret the position of the Attorney General adopted by the court below, it is this: Amended \u00a7 20 applies to the deportation of those aliens who have <em>entered </em>the United States whether legally of illegally. All such aliens \u201cshall, upon the warrant of the Attorney General, be taken into custody and deported.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Section 18, on the other hand, applies to the deportation of aliens who, upon seeking admission to our shores, are not allowed to <em>land </em>or <em>enter </em>the country. Such aliens \u201cshall be detained on board the vessel bringing them, or in a United States immigration station * * *.'\u2019 <footnotemark>10</footnotemark> warrant for their arrest need be issued by the Attorney General for their \u201ctemporary removal shall not be considered a landing * * <footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Since the removal of appellants and their subsequent release into the country on parole and under bond was not a landing or entry, they were found to be subject to the provisions of \u00a7 18.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-15\">We cannot agree with this view of the statutory scheme although we do agree that appellants never landed or entered the country within the meaning of our immigration laws.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Section 18 reads.in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Anc\">\u201cAll aliens brought to this country in violation of law shall be immediately sent back, in accommodations of the same class in which they arrived, to the country whence they respectively came, on the vessels bringing them, unless in the opinion of the Attorney General immediate deportation is not practicable or proper.\u201d <footnotemark>13</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"AHz\">By its terms, this section applies to those who are \u201cbrought\u201d to our shores illegally. Such persons \u201cshall be immediately sent back\u201d on the vessels bringing them. This language contemplates an arrival which culminates in an <em>immediate </em>rejection of the alien. These provisions were \u201cnot aimed at the aliens of the excluded class, but at the owners of vessels unlawfully bringing them into this country.\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> One of its chief objectives was \u201cto protect the alien\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> from exploitation 'by the transportation companies. But whatever its historical origin, \u00a7 18 clearly distinguishes between immediate rejection of the alien and allowing him to stay when \u201cin the opinion of the Attorney General immediate deportation is \u25a0 not practicable or proper.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b374-16\">These are not cases where appellants were- \u201cimmediately sent back\u201d. Certainly, their first entries many years ago, albeit illegal, cannot be brought within the \u00a7 18 category. Nor, in our opinion, do their more recent arrivals which resulted in their detention, prosecution, parole, etc., qualify as a \u00a7 18 situation. Since appellants were not \u201cimmediately sent back * * * on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>the vessels bringing them,\u201d we must assume that \u201cin the opinion of the Attorney General immediate deportation [was] not practicable or proper.\u201d It is immaterial that his opinion rested upon a judgment that appellants should be prosecuted for a violation of our laws. And since \u00a7 18 provides no alternative authority for executing the orders of deportation in the event that deportation is not \u201cimmediate,\u201d the Attorney General must look elsewhere for authority to carry out the deportations in question here.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-5\">The only other source, of authority for executing orders of deportation is amended \u00a7 20 of the Immigration Act of 1917. That section not only applies to \u201c[t]he deportation of aliens provided for in * * * chapter [six] * * <footnotemark>16</footnotemark> but, in addition, to \u201call other immigration laws of the United States * * <footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Although the records in the present cases do not reveal the statutory provision or provisions under which appellants were found excludable and hence deportable, we may assume from the stipulation of facts filed below in one of the cases<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> that it was either \u00a7 3 of the 1917 Act<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> or \u00a7 13(a) of the Immigration Act of 1924,<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> or both. Both of these sections are found in chapter 6. We agree with appellants that amended \u00a7 20 is applicable under the circumstances of their cases <footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b375-8\">This view of the relationship between \u00a7\u00a7 18 and amended 20 accords with past administrative interpretation. As we have already stated, there were no changes in amending \u00a7 20 which affect its applicability in these cases. Yet in cases decided before \u00a7 20 was amended and which involved circumstances similar to those of the present cases, the immigration authorities apparently held the view that deportation should be effected in the manner prescribed by \u00a7 20. In United States ex rel. Pantano v. Corsi,<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> the alien, an Italian citizen, left Italy and went to Canada in 1924. He remained there one month and then entered the United States illegally. Pie stayed until 1931 when he made a visit to Italy. Upon his return, he sought admission on the basis of a fraudulently obtained re-entry permit, but was excluded by a board of special inquiry and ordered deported to- Italy. His testimony before the board of special inquiry resulted, however, in his being indicted and convicted for violating the immigration laws. After sentence therefor, he was taken into custody without warrant of arrest for deportation under \u00a7 20. In a habeas corpus proceeding, the court held that the alien could be proceeded against without the warrant of arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-18\">The strength of the administrative conviction that \u00a7 20 rather than \u00a7 18 was'applicable in the Corsi situation is indicated by the choice of the country to which Corsi was ordered deported. Exercising his discretion under \u00a7 20, the Secretary of Labor<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> ordered Corsi deported to Italy rather than to Canada. This choice of countries was apparently important to the Secretary, since he defended it in the habeas corpus action. Yet had the Secretary considered \u00a7 18 applicable, he could have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>avoided any question with respect to the country since that section makes it clear that if it were applied, Italy could be the only destination under the Corsi facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-4\">The more recent case of United States ex rel. Ling Yee Suey v. Spar<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> furnishes additional evidence of the administrative view on the problem now before us. There the aliens, natives of China, arrived in New York on November 25, 1941, from Singapore, as crew members of a British merchant vessel. They remained on board until April 11, 1942, under detention of immigration authorities, when they were arrested by New York police for engaging in a riot on board ship. While they were held for these charges, the vessel sailed from New York without them. After criminal charges against them were dismissed, they were taken into custody by the immigration authorities pursuant to warrants of arrest, and after hearings were ordered deported to India \u201c \u2018because of enemy occupation of China\u2019 \u201d, pursuant to \u00a7 20. We note the case because the immigration authorities did not even attempt to act under \u00a7 18, though we see no reason why, by the terms of appellee\u2019s argument in this court, such action would not have been clearly called for.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b376-5\">We conclude that whenever the Attorney General chooses to delay deportation as long as he did in these cases for the purpose of prosecuting an alien who is subject to \u201cimmediate deportation,\u201d he cannot thereafter proceed to deport that alien under \u00a7 18 since the immediacy required for its application no longer exists. In that event, the procedures outlined in amended \u00a7 20 must be used.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-6\">Reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-7\">PROCTOR, Circuit Judge, dissents.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b373-10\">.
