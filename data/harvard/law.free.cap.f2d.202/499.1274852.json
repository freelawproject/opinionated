In 1949 it purchased materials in excess of $250,000. Of this .amount .more -than $90,000 was expended for materials shipped from points in the United States outside of the state of California.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-9\">During 1949 Zall sold in California poultry feed valued at more than $75,000 to a firm which used the feed in production of poultry and eggs. This firm shipped to points outside the state .of California eggs and poultry valued at more than $60,000. Feed purchased from Zall is fed to breeding stock, not to baby chicks. The breeding stock is not shipped out of the state but hatching eggs are. ' The Board found on this state of facts that Zall \u201cwas engaged in the manufacture of a product closely connected with, and necessary to; the production of goods for commerce and that unfair labor practices on the part of respondent [Zall] might very well lead to labor disputes which would burden and obstruct commerce.\u201d We agree. Cf. McComb v. Super-A Fertilizer Works, Inc., 1 Cir., 1948, 165 F.2d 824.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-12\">The Board further found: One, that Zall had violated \u00a7 8(a)(1) and (5) of the Act, 29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 158(a) (1) and (5), in that it had refused to honor the Union's request to bargain. Two, that it had dealt directly with its employees and unilaterally changed the terms of employment in face of the fact that the employees had selected the Union to represent them which Zall then well knew. ' ' ' \u25a0</p>\n<p id=\"b556-13\">Zall challenges the finding we have designated as One, on the ground that the evidence failed to show a clear-cut request to negotiate. The evidence relied on by the Board to support this challenged finding impresses us as being unsubstantial. By September 26, 1950 organizers for the Union \"had succeeded in getting one employee of Zall to sign an application for membership in the Union. With this one application in their possession (obviously insufficient to constitute the Union a bargaining agent) the organizers called upon Sam Zall and informed him that they intended to \u25a0 organize his shop. Sam Zall said in response: \u201cI don\u2019t want a union here a.nd my people do not need a union.\u201d One of the organizers told Sam Zall that he would change his views after they were better acquainted. Gamble, one of the- union organizers, gave Sam Zall a copy of the Union\u2019s master agreement which the Union regularly used as basis' of negotiation and asked Sam Zall to study it so they could discuss it a week or so later. We fail to find a refusal to bargain violative of the Act in the foregoing conversation and circumstances, for the simple reason that at that time the organizers were not authorized to represent the employees and an unauthorized organizer cannot validly request an employer to bargain.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-14\">On October 3, 1950, a majority of the employees having signed cards, the organizers returned to the plant and held a further conversation with Sam Zall. Mr. Gamble testified to a conversation had with Sam Zall.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> There is nothing in Mr. Gamble\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>version of the conversation to indicate that the parties were talking about anything other than an election. The Board seized upon a statement made by Sam Zall during this conversation in an effort to supply substance to their finding that he refused to negotiate.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b557-5\">It seems clear that the organizers had in mind, when this conversation occurred, one subject only, viz.: to secure consent for authority to represent the employees without the necessity, of holding an election. That was what Sam Zall was talking about when he stated in his testimony that they asked him, to negotiate. While it seems apparent that the Union at the time, by reason of the signed cards, had authority to represent the employees in negotiation, it is equally apparent that the organizers were not aware of that fact else why would they be talking about an election to give the Union that status. This is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>important because it is highly improbable that the Union representatives laboring under the impression that they lacked authority of representation would make \u201ca clear and unequivocal demand for recognition\u201d (The Solomon Company, 84 N.L.R.B. 26) to bargain \u201cin respect to rates of pay, wages, hours of employment, or other conditions of employment.\u201d A refusal so to do, after proper demand, is necessary to constitute a violation of \u00a7 8(a) (1, 5) of the Act, 29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 158(a) (1, 5).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Nowhere does it appear that the Union made any such proper, demand. Its representatives talked to. Sam Zall about consenting to representation without an election. Sam Zall refused. Such a conclusion is all the evidence supports.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-4\">We think the Board\u2019s finding, which we designate number Two, that Zall violated \u00a7 8(a)(1) of the Act, 29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 158(a)(1),<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> is supported by substantial evidence. Zall had been put on notice subsequent to the meeting of October 3, 1950, of the. Union\u2019s bargaining status as a result of its consultation with employees. Efforts were then made by Zall to induce its employees to abandon the Union and to deal directly with it in the negotiation of a contract providing for increased wages and for overtime work. Zall succeeded in negotiating a contract. No contract in this field had theretofore existed between Zall and its employees. The fact that the Union had not requested bargaining did not constitute a defense for Zall\u2019s failure, (it then having knowledge of the Union\u2019s bargaining status) to consult with the Union before entering into bargaining negotiations with its employees with a view of changing the terms of employment. Its action constituted a .violation of the Act. Medo Photo Supply Corp. v. N. L. R. B., 1944, 321 U.S. 678, 64 S.Ct. 830, 88 L.Ed. 1007.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-13\">The order of the Board is modified so as to eliminate therefrom all reference to a violation of \u00a7 8(a)(5) of the Act, 29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 158(a)(5), and all requirements and directions to Zall based upon the Board\u2019s finding that Zall had violated said \u00a7 8(a)(5), and as so modified let the order be enforced.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b556-10\">. \u201cA. I asked Mr. Zall if he had read and studied the contract. He said \u2018Yes,\u2019 he had. I asked him .what he thought of it, and he said he thought it was a very good <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>contract, but that was one man\u2019s opinion. I asked him if he would consent to a joint election which was customary between unions and employers for the purpose of recognition of the union as his employees\u2019 representative. He stated that he had already previously stated his position that he did not want a union in the plant. I asked him if he would consent to an election if we had over thirty per cent.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b557-8\">\u201cQ. Thirty per cent what? A. Thirty per cent of the membership signed up. Signed up means the authorization cards. He says, \u2018Have yon got them?\u201d I said \u2018Yes.\u2019 He said, \u2018Let me see them.\u2019 I said, \u2018Oh, no.\u2019 I said, \u2018That is for the Board, and if the Board decides to let you see the authorization cards, that will be another matter.\u2019 He stated again that he had previously made himself known on this matter and at that time we should have, and he went into the plant and we loft the premises.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b557-10\">\u201cQ. You say he stated that he had previously made himself known on this matter. Are you attempting to repeat his words? A. I was attempting to repeat his words as nearly as I possibly could, yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b557-11\">\u201cQ. Is that all you remember about your conversation with him? A. That is all at this time that I can remember.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b557-12\">\u201cQ. Did you discuss petitioning for an election? A. Well, I did discuss petitioning for an election.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b557-13\">\u201cQ. Wliat did you say in that connection? A. I said to him, I says \u2014 but that was after I had made the statement that if we had over thirty per cent of the signatures and he asked me if \u2014 we have already gone through that \u2014 he says, \u2018Go ahead and have your election.\u2019 And he says, \u2018That is when our good relations will cease, when you have an election.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b557-14\">. \u201cA. I don\u2019t recall word for word wliat wae said. Mr. Gamble or Mr. Hanifin stated that they would like to negotiate, and I told them that I wasn\u2019t interested in negotiating, and then they said, I believe, that in that case we would have to have an election, and I said \u2014 which was all new to me; I didn\u2019t know what they particularly meant by that, and he explained to me that if they had authorization cards from 30% of the men, that they could file with the NLRB for an election, that if they won 51% of the votes, that they would then be the bargaining agent for the men. They were just getting ready to' leave, almost in their car, when he explained that to me, and I said, \u2018Well, go ahead and file for your election.\u2019</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b557-17\">\u201cQ. Did you ask him\u2014 A. I asked him when he told me \u2014 he then told me\u2014 I then asked him, Well, do you have 30% of the votes, authorization votes in this establishment?\u2019 and he said, \u2018Yes.\u2019 And I said, Well, may I see the cards, or will you tell me the names of those who authorized you to say that?\u2019 And he said, uo, he wouldn\u2019t. I don\u2019t know the exact words he used, but he said no, he wouldn\u2019t. That was it. He wouldn\u2019t tell me or show mo who they were.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b557-19\">\u201cQ. Well, on that day, when earlier in the conversation you said to him you didn\u2019t need a union or words to that effect, at that time you didn\u2019t even ask his verification that he had 30% authorizations, did you? A. I didn\u2019t have the slightest inkling that he was prepared to negotiate.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b557-20\">\u201cQ. Well, were you aware, or had you been informed by any of your men that either Mr. Gamble or Hanifin bad been in there talking about them? A. Yes, Cotton had told me once or twice that the union men were active at the plant and I told Cotton that if he saw them again not to give them permission to talk to the men on my time, and I guess he never saw them again to tell them that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b557-21\">\u201cQ. In any event, on October 3rd, or whatever day it may have been, when you made the statement that you didn\u2019t need a union, you had no knowledge that they had signed anybody up? A. Not the slightest.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b558-5\">. \u201cSec. 8.
