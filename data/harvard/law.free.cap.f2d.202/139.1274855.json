The road was about twenty-three and one-half feet wide, very mountainous and full of curves. According to the findings of fact by the district court, \u201cThis was about 6:00 o\u2019clock a. m. and the rising sun was in such a position that it struck plaintiff full in the face as his car headed east, so that plaintiff was somewhat blinded, and the righthand wheels of his car angled off the edge of the road, and thus continued to move forward for several feet, when gravity overtook the vehicle and it tumbled sideways down the precipice into the rocky canyon below.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b196-4\">The court found that \u201cthe road in question did not cave-in, crumble or collapse at the place where the automobile left - the highway\u201d and further \u201cthat the defendant was not negligent in. failing to erect and maintain guard rails or other suitable barriers along the outer edge of said road at the place of accident sufficient to repel the momentum of a moving automobile.\u201d Liability was based on the court\u2019s finding that the Government was negligent \"in failing to erect and maintain along the outer edge of said road suitable posts or other warning devices\u201d and that such negligence was the proximate cause of the accident and of plaintiff\u2019s injuries and damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-13\">Assuming without deciding that the negligence found by the court is within the .terms of the Federal Tort Claims Act, we are of the opinion that under the evidence the finding of negligence proximately causing the plaintiff\u2019s injuries was clearly erroneous. The plaintiff admitted that he had used the road dozens of times, was thoroughly familiar with it, that he knew there were no guard rails on it, and that he knew where the edge of the road was.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Failure to warn the plaintiff could not have been negligence proximately causing his injuries when he was already so familiar with the road as to appreciate the peril, 2 Am.Law Institute, Restatement of Torts, \u00a7 340; 38 Am Jur., Negligence, \u00a7 91.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-14\">The judgment is, therefore, reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"Aq5\">Reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b195-23\">. 60 Stat. 842, now appearing as 28 U.S.C.A. 1346(b), 2401(b) and 2671 et seq.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b196-5\">. \u201cQ.
