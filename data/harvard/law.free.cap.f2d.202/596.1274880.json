Thereupon, on October 22, 1951, a judgment was entered sentencing appellant to be imprisoned for three years on each count of the indictment, the prison sentence on count 2 to run concurrently with that on count 1, the prison sentence on count 3 to run consecutively with that on count 1, and the prison sentence on count 4 to run concurrently with that on count 3; suspending the execution of the prison sentences on counts 1 and 2 and admitting appellant to probation for five years with respect to those counts, on condition that he pay a fine of $10,000 on count 1 at the rate of $175 per month, commencing on November 1, 1951; suspending the execution of the prison sentences on counts 3 and 4 and admitting appellant to probation with respect to those counts, on condition that he pay a fine of $10,000 on count 3 (in addition to the fine on count 1) at the rate of $175 per month, commencing on November 1, 1951, such monthly payments to be made concurrently with, and in addition to, those previously mentioned. This appeal is from that judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-14\">Appellant\u2019s brief contains a specification of errors <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> improperly entitled \u201cPoints and errors on appeal.\u201d The specification contains nine paragraphs. Paragraph 1 does not set out any error.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> It merely states: \u201cThe evidence is not sufficient to sustain <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>the. verdict or judgment of guilty as to any count in the indictment.\u201d The statement is incorrect. The evidence is sufficient to sustain the verdict and judgment as to each- count of the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-4\">Paragraph 2 of the specification states: \u201cThe court erroneously admitted in evidence the amended returns for 1945 and 1946. \u201d- Paragraph 3 of the specification states: \u201cThe court erroneously admitted into evidence on behalf of ;the prosecution summaries ' of evidence without\u2019 proper foundation and without evidentiary support in the record.\u201d Paragraph 5 of the specification states: \u201cThe court erred -in not permitting appellant full latitude to develop and introduce oral and written evidence relating to competent, relevant and material activities in 1942, 1943, 1944 and 1947. \u201d Paragraph 6 of the specification states: \u201cThe court erroneously admitted on behalf of the prosecution oral and written evidence pertaining to purported prior similar offenses and acts.\u201d Paragraph 8 of the specification states: \u201cThe court erred in refusing to admit in evidence various exhibits offered by appellant, and in overruling appellant\u2019s objections and motions as to c\u00e9rtain of the prosecution\u2019s evi-. dence, and in admitting such evidence.\u201d Thus paragraphs 2, 3' and 6 relate to the admission of evidence, paragraph 5 relates to the rejection of evidence, and' paragraph 8 relates to the admission and rejection of evidence. These paragraphs do not quote the grounds, if any, urged at the trial for the objections, if any, or the full substance of the evidence admitted or* rejected, or refer to the pages of 'the record where the same may be found.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Hence these paragraphs need not be considered.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b654-20\">Paragraph 4 of the specification states: \u201cThe court erred in overruling appellant\u2019s motions to strike certain counts in the indictment on grounds of double jeopardy.\u201d There was, in fact, no motion to strike any count of the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-21\">Paragraph 7 of the specification states: \u201cThe trial judge erred in denying appellant\u2019s motions at the trial.\u201d Many motions of appellant were denied at the trial. Paragraph 7 does not designate or specify the motions said to have been erroneously denied or refer to the pages of the record where the same may be found. Thus paragraph 7 fails to set out separately and particularly the alleged errors therein referred to.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Hence it need not be considered.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-22\">Paragraph 9 of the specification states: \u201cThe court failed to give the jury full and correct instructions as to the law applicable in this case, and specifically, refused and failed to give to the jury certain instructions offered by appellant.\u201d This paragraph relates to the charge of the court. In effect, it states that the court erred in-refusing and failing to include in the charge certain instructions requested by appellant. It does not set out the requested instructions totidem verbis, or at all,, or the grounds, if any, of the objections, if any, urged at the trial.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Hence it need not. be considered.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b654-23\">However,' we have considered all paragraphs' of the specification, have examined the entire record and have found no reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-24\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b652-17\">. Section 145(b) provides that \u201cany person who willfully attempts in any manner to evade or defeat any tax imposed by this chapter [26 U.S.C.A.Int.Rev.
