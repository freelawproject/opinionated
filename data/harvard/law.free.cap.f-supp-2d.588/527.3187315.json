(Doc.8.)</p>\n<p id=\"b566-17\">I. <em>Background</em></p>\n<p id=\"b566-18\">Plaintiffs Brian Fielman, Carmen Colla-do, Michael Jones, Regina P. Kelly, and Amanda Litschke, as individuals and on behalf of a class consisting of all individuals in the United States who purchased <em>Aquafina </em>bottled water from the date of its introduction through the present, filed a Consolidated and Amended Class Action Complaint<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> on May 8, 2008 (the \u201cCom<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>plaint\u201d) (Doc. 4), alleging that Defendants PepsiCo, Inc., The Pepsi Bottling Group, Inc., and Pepsi Bottling Ventures LLC (collectively, \u201cPepsi\u201d or \u201cDefendants\u201d), fraudulently misrepresented the source of <em>Aquafina </em>water by using a label designed to create the impression that the water came from a mountain source and failing to inform consumers that the true source of <em>Aquafina </em>water was public drinking supplies commonly known as \u201ctap water.\u201d (Compl. \u00b6 1.) Plaintiffs assert three causes of action: (1) unfair and deceptive trade practices in violation of state consumer protection statutes;<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> (2) unjust enrichment; and (3) violation of the Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act, Cal. Civ.Code \u00a7 1790, <em>et seq.</em><footnotemark><em>3</em></footnotemark><em> </em>The allegations in the Complaint can be summarized as follows.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-4\"><em>Aquafina </em>was first introduced in 1994 and gained national distribution with Pepsi in 1997. The label on <em>Aquafina </em>bottled water contains certain graphics, including a cartoon-like blue squiggle that evokes a mountain range, overlaid on a red-orange circle that evokes a rising or setting sun. The front of the label contains the slogan \u201cPure Water \u2014 Perfect Taste\u201d and the product description \u201cPurified Drinking Water.\u201d The back of the label contains the ambiguous statement \u201cBOTTLED AT THE SOURCE P.W.S.\u201d The label does not indicate the source or state the meaning of \u201cP.W.S.,\u201d but Plaintiffs contend it is an abbreviation for \u201cPublic Water Supply.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b567-7\">On or about July 27, 2007, Pepsi disclosed that, since its introduction to the market, the water used in <em>Aquafina </em>has been sourced from public drinking supplies. At this time, Pepsi allegedly agreed to re-label <em>Aquafina </em>to include information clarifying the source of the water, releasing a statement saying: \u201cIf this helps to clarify the fact that the water originates from public sources, then it\u2019s a reasonable thing to do.\u201d (Compl. \u00b6 40.) Nevertheless, Plaintiffs contend that since July 27, 2007, Pepsi has continued to sell or permitted the continued selling of <em>Aquafina </em>with the labeling unchanged.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-8\">Plaintiffs allege that they were frequent purchasers of <em>Aquafina </em>water in the years prior to the public disclosure, and that they were \u201cshocked and surprised to learn ... that the true source of the water in <em>Aquafina </em>[was] tap water and that they had paid a premium price for tap water.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6 8.) Prior to the disclosure, Plaintiffs claim that they believed that \u201cthe true source for <em>Aquafina </em>was mountain spring water.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6\u00b6 3-8.) Plaintiffs allege that Defendants intentionally created this \u201cfalse impression\u201d through its misleading marketing and labeling scheme in order to benefit from the higher prices they could obtain by misrepresenting <em>Aquafina </em>as mountain spring water. In support of this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>allegation, Plaintiffs note that prior to July-2007, <em>Aquafina </em>was the best-selling brand of bottled water in the United States based on sales volume, and Defendants received revenues of approximately $2.17 billion on sales of <em>Aquafina </em>in 2006 alone.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-4\">On June 16, 2008, Defendants filed the present Motion to Dismiss, and a Memorandum of Law in Support of their Motion to Dismiss. (Doc. 9.) Defendants argue that Plaintiffs\u2019 claims should be dismissed on the grounds that: (1) Plaintiffs\u2019 claims are expressly preempted by Section 403A of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (\u201cFDCA\u201d), 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 343-l(a)(l); (2) Plaintiffs\u2019 claims are preempted under the doctrine of implied conflict preemption; and (3) Plaintiffs\u2019 claims fail to satisfy the pleading requirements of the various state law or common law claims alleged.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-5\">Plaintiffs filed a Memorandum of Law in Opposition to Defendants\u2019 Motion to Dismiss on August 8, 2008 (\u201cPis.\u2019 Opp\u2019n\u201d). (Doc. 14.) Defendants filed their Reply Memorandum of Law in Support of their Motion to Dismiss on September 26, 2008. (Doc. 18.) Oral argument was held on November 7, 2008.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-6\">II. <em>Discussion</em></p>\n<p id=\"b568-7\">A. Preemption</p>\n<p id=\"b568-8\">Defendants move to dismiss on the grounds that Plaintiffs\u2019 state law claims are preempted by federal law, both explicitly, by the FDCA\u2019s express preemption provision, and impliedly, because they conflict with the statutory scheme related to the labeling of purified water. Express preemption is \u201cpresent when Congress\u2019s intent to preempt state law is \u2018explicitly stated in the statute\u2019s language.\u2019 \u201d <em>Mills v. Giant of Md., LLC, </em>441 F.Supp.2d 104, 106 (D.D.C.2006) (quoting <em>Jones v. Rath Packing Co., </em>430 U.S. 519, 525, 97 S.Ct. 1305, 51 L.Ed.2d 604 (1977)). Implied preemption is \u201capplicable \u2018where compliance with both federal and state regulations is a physical impossibility, or where state law stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of Congress.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Gade v. Nat\u2019l Solid Wastes Mgmt. Ass\u2019n, </em>505 U.S. 88, 98, 112 S.Ct. 2374, 120 L.Ed.2d 73 (1992)).</p>\n<p id=\"b568-10\">\u201cPreemption is always a matter of congressional intent.\u201d <em>Wachovia Bank, N.A. v. Burke, </em>414 F.3d 305, 314 (2d Cir. 2005) (citing <em>Fid. Fed. Sav. &amp; Loan Ass\u2019n v. de la Cuesta, </em>458 U.S. 141, 152, 102 S.Ct. 3014, 73 L.Ed.2d 664 (1982)). \u201cSince the existence of preemption turns on Congress\u2019s intent, we are to \u2018begin as we do in any exercise of statutory construction^] with the text of the provision in question, and move on, as need be, to the structure and purpose of the Act in which it occurs.\u2019 \u201d <em>McNally v. The Port Auth. of N.Y. &amp; N.J., </em>414 F.3d 352, 371 (2d Cir. 2005) (alteration in original) (quoting <em>N.Y. State Conference of Blue Cross &amp; Blue Shield Plans v. Travelers Ins. Co., </em>514 U.S. 645, 655, 115 S.Ct. 1671, 131 L.Ed.2d 695 (1995)). Accordingly, courts apply the following analytical framework in determining Congressional intent to preempt state law:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b568-11\">If the statute contains an express preemption clause, the task of statutory construction must in the first instance focus on the plain wording of the clause, which necessarily contains the best evidence of Congress\u2019 pre-emptive intent. Where the language of the statute plainly indicates that Congress intended preemption, we must give effect to the plain language unless there is good reason to believe Congress intended the language to have some more restrictive meaning. If the text of the statute is ambiguous, either as to Congress\u2019s intent to preempt at all or as to the extent of an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>intended preemption, the meaning of the statute may be gleaned from its context and from the statutory scheme as a whole, or by resort to the normal canons of construction and legislative history.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AjE\"><em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks and citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b569-4\">1. Express Preemption</p>\n<p id=\"b569-5\">In the interest of promoting honesty and fair dealing, Congress has provided the Food and Drug Administration (\u201cFDA\u201d) with the power to \u201cpromulgate regulations fixing and establishing for any food, under its common or usual name so far as practicable, a reasonable definition and standard of identity.\u201d 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 341. Here, Defendants\u2019 Motion to Dismiss hinges on the \u201cstandard of identity\u201d for \u201cpurified drinking water\u201d and the express preemption provision of Section 403A of the FDCA, passed as part of the Nutrition Labeling and Education Act of 1990 (\u201cNLEA\u201d), Pub.L. No. 101-535, 104 Stat. 2353. The standard of identity for bottled water establishes definitions for several different types of bottled water, including \u201cpurified water,\u201d \u201cartesian water,\u201d \u201cground water,\u201d \u201cmineral water,\u201d and \u201cspring water.\u201d 21 C.F.R. \u00a7 165.110(a). Purified water is defined as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b569-6\">The name of water that has been produced by distillation, deionization, reverse osmosis, or other suitable processes and that meets the definition of \u201cpurified water\u201d in the United States Pharmacopeia, 23d Revision, January 1, 1995 ... may be \u201cpurified water\u201d or \u201cdemineralized water.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b569-7\"><em>Id. </em>\u00a7 165.110(a)(2)(iv). Section 403A of the FDCA provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b569-8\">(a) [N]o State or political subdivision of a State may directly or indirectly establish under any authority or continue in effect as to any food in interstate commerce\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b569-9\">(1) any <em>requirement </em>for food which is the subject of a standard of identity established under section 401 [21 U.S.C. \u00a7 341] that is <em>not identical to </em>such standard of identity or that is not identical to the requirement of section 403(g) [21 U.S.C. \u00a7 343(g) ].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b569-10\">21 U.S.C. \u00a7 343-l(a)(l) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b569-11\">Under the FDCA\u2019s misbranding provision, a food (including bottled water) purporting to be a food for which a definition and standard of identity has been prescribed is deemed \u201cmislabeled\u201d if: (1) it does not conform with the applicable standard of identity; or (2) its label does not bear the name of the food specified in the definition and standard. 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 343(g). The FDCA \u201cdoes not provide a private right of action.\u201d <em>Savalle v. Nestle Waters N. Am,., Inc., </em>289 F.Supp.2d 31, 33 (D.Conn.2003) (citing <em>Merrell Dow Pharrn. Inc. v. Thompson, </em>478 U.S. 804, 812, 106 S.Ct. 3229, 92 L.Ed.2d 650 (1986)). Accordingly, Plaintiffs do not claim misbranding under \u00a7 343(g), but instead claim that Defendants are liable under various state consumer protections laws for misleadingly and deceptively suggesting that <em>Aquafina </em>has a mountain source. Plaintiffs argue that their state law claims are not preempted either because: (1) Defendants\u2019 alleged labeling misrepresentations \u201cwent beyond the FDCA\u2019s prescription\u201d (in other words, notwithstanding compliance with the FDCA, Defendants may be held liable under state law for misrepresentations regarding the source of purified water because federal law is silent on the subject) (Pis.\u2019 Opp\u2019n 5); or (2) Defendants\u2019 alleged labeling misrepresentations did not comply with the FDCA\u2019s labeling requirements (in other words, Defendants can be held liable for state law claims that create a private right of action for noncompliance with the FDCA). <em>(Id. </em>8.)</p>\n<p id=\"b570-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>2. Relevant Law</p>\n<p id=\"b570-4\">Section 403A preempts state law \u201crequirements].\u201d 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 343-l(a)(l). In the context of express preemption provisions, \u201cthe term \u2018requirements\u2019 ... reaches beyond positive enactments, such as statutes and regulations, to embrace common-law duties.\u201d <em>Bates v. Dow Agrosciences L.L.C., </em>544 U.S. 431, 443, 125 S.Ct. 1788, 161 L.Ed.2d 687 (2005); <em>accord Riegel v. Medtronic, Inc., </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 999, 1008, 169 L.Ed.2d 892 (reaffirming that common-law causes of action for negligence and strict liability impose \u201crequirements\u201d). In contrast, an \u201coccurrence that merely motivates an optional decision\u201d \u2014 such as the threat of a state law damages remedy for violation of an existing federal requirement \u2014 does not itself qualify as a requirement. <em>Bates, </em>544 U.S. at 443, 448, 125 S.Ct. 1788; <em>see Medtronic, Inc. v. Lohr, </em>518 U.S. 470, 513, 116 S.Ct. 2240, 135 L.Ed.2d 700 (1996) (O\u2019Connor, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part) (\u201c[T]he threat of a [state law] damages remedy\u201d does not impose a \u201crequirement\u201d where \u201cthe requirements imposed on [defendants] under state and federal law do not differ.\u201d). In other words, state law causes of action are not preempted where they merely provide a damages remedy for claims premised on a violation of federal law that does not itself provide a private right of action, but are preempted where they impose obligations not imposed by federal law. <em>Riegel, </em>128 S.Ct. at 1011 (affirming dismissal of claims that medical device violated state law notwithstanding compliance with relevant federal requirements).</p>\n<p id=\"b570-7\">Accordingly, the mere fact that Plaintiffs\u2019 state law claims threaten private liability that does not exist under the FDCA is not sufficient to bring those claims within the preemptive scope of Section 403A. Rather, preemption under Section 403A requires that state liability be based on a requirement that is \u201cnot identical to\u201d the federal requirements. 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 343-1(a)(1). Thus I must look to whether the duties imposed by Plaintiffs\u2019 state law claims are \u201cidentical\u201d to those imposed by the standard of identity for purified drinking water.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-9\">In establishing a standard of identity for bottled water, the FDA intended that \u201cthe only State requirements that are subject to preemption are those that are affirmatively different from the Federal requirements on matters that are covered by the Section 403A(a) of the [NLEA].\u201d Beverages: Bottled Water, 60 Fed.Reg. 57,076, 57,120 (Nov. 13, 1995). The federal regulation concerning the requirements for State petitions for exemption from Section 403A provides further clarification on the intended scope of express preemption under the FDCA:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b570-10\">\u201cNot identical to\u201d does not refer to the specific words in the requirement but instead means that the State requirement <em>directly or indirectly imposes obligations </em>or contains provisions concerning the composition or labeling of food, or concerning a food container, that:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b570-11\">(i) <em>Are not imposed by </em>or contained in the applicable provision (including any implementing regulation) of section 401 or 403 of the act; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b570-12\">(ii) <em>Differ from those specifically imposed by </em>or contained in the applicable provision (including any implementing regulation) of section 401 or 403 of the act.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b570-13\">21 C.F.R. \u00a7 100.1(c)(4)(i) \u2014 (ii) (emphasis added). Thus, state law cannot impose obligations beyond, or different from, what federal law requires.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-14\">This interpretation is not disturbed by the NLEA\u2019s rule of construction concerning the scope of preemption, which provides in relevant part that, \u201c[t]he [NLEA] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>shall not be construed to preempt any provision of State law, unless such provision is expressly preempted under section 403A of the [FDCA].\u201d NLEA, Pub.L. No. 101-535, \u00a7 6(c)(1), 104 Stat. 2353, 2364. That rule of construction applies only where preemption is sought under provisions other than Section 403A of the FDCA.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b571-4\">The principle that state law cannot impose obligations other than what federal law requires is supported by <em>Bates, </em>544 U.S. at 452, 125 S.Ct. 1788, in which the Supreme Court, in addressing the narrower express preemption provision of the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Roden-ticide Act (\u201cFIFRA\u201d), 7 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 136 <em>et seq., </em>held that \u201ccompeting state labeling standards\u201d creating potential liability under state law are preempted where the manufacturer would not also be held liable under federal law.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Finding that the plaintiffs\u2019 state law fraud and negligent-failure-to-warn claims were premised on common law rules that qualify as \u201crequirements\u201d within the scope of the preemption provision, the Court held that state-law labeling requirements were not preempted to the extent they were \u201cequivalent to, and fully consistent with, FIFRA\u2019s misbrand-ing provisions.\u201d <em>Bates, </em>544 U.S. at 447, 125 S.Ct. 1788. Thus, the critical determination (for which the Court remanded the case) was whether the state law claims \u201cimposed a broader obligation than [federal law].\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 453, 125 S.Ct. 1788. In language strikingly similar to the regulation explaining the meaning of the phrase \u201cnot identical to\u201d in the FDCA\u2019s express preemption provision, 21 C.F.R. \u00a7 100.1(c)(4)(i)-(ii) (\u201c \u2018Not identical to\u2019 does not refer to the specific words in the [federal] requirement but instead means that the State requirement directly or indirectly imposes obligations ... that: [a]re not imposed by or ... [d]iffer from those specifically imposed by [the federal requirement] ... \u201d), the Supreme Court instructed that courts undertaking a \u201cparallel requirements\u201d preemption analysis at the pleadings stage of a case \u201cshould bear in mind the concept of equivalence\u201d rather than requiring that the state law requirements \u201cbe phrased in the <em>identical </em>language as its corresponding [federal] requirement\u201d in order to survive preemption. <em>Bates, </em>544 U.S. at 453, 125 S.Ct. 1788 (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b571-8\">Following <em>Bates, </em>the court in <em>Vermont Pure Holdings, Ltd. v. Nestle Waters North America, Inc., </em>followed a similar approach, holding that the plaintiffs claims that the defendant misleadingly marketed Poland Spring water as \u201cspring water\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>were \u201cnot preempted to the extent that they [were] based solely on state laws that provide private rights of action and have adopted the FDA definition of \u2018spring water.\u2019 \u201d No. 03-11465, 2006 WL 839486, at *7, 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 13683, at *22 (D.Mass. Mar. 28, 2006). The court reasoned that the \u201cspring water\u201d claims were \u201cdistinct from a situation in which a state enacts a statute that substantively adds to federal labeling requirements,\u201d because Vermont Pure did \u201cnot seek either to challenge or add to the FDA\u2019s definition of \u2018spring water.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at *7, 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 13683 at *20. In other words, the claim was not preempted because the plaintiff did not seek to impose a requirement beyond or different from federal law. Regarding Vermont Pure\u2019s claims that Nestle misleadingly marketed Poland Spring as \u201cpure\u201d when it was allegedly aware of contamination, the court held that such claims were not preempted because \u201c[n]o federal standards of identity for bottled water purity exist.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at *9, 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 13683 at *30. Thus, state law claims based on issues addressed by federal regulation were permitted only to the extent they were based on or parallel to federal regulations, but if federal law did not address the issue at all, the claims were permitted to go forward. The <em>Vermont Pure </em>court thus construed the regulation that prohibits state requirements that \u201c[a]re not imposed by\u201d the act, 21 C.F.R. \u00a7 100.1(c)(4)(i), as permitting the states to impose requirements where the FDA has been silent.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b572-4\">More recently, in <em>Mills, </em>441 F.Supp.2d at 106, the court, noting that the \u201cscope of the FDCA\u2019s preemption clause is much broader than FIFRA\u2019s,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 108, which was at issue in <em>Bates, </em>held that the plaintiffs\u2019 claims that milk should have a warning label for lactose intolerance were preempted because their proposed warning label \u201cwould far exceed\u201d the \u201ccarefully delineated list of information\u201d required under the standard of identity for milk labels. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b572-7\">3. Application</p>\n<p id=\"b572-8\">In order to resolve this dispute, the Court must first analyze the FDCA\u2019s labeling requirements for bottled water meeting the standard of identify for \u201cpurified water,\u201d and then determine whether Plaintiffs\u2019 state law causes of action impose any \u201crequirement ... that is not identical to\u201d those of the FDCA. 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 343-1(a)(1). If it is determined that Plaintiffs\u2019 state law causes of action \u201cimpose[] a broader obligation than [federal law],\u201d then they are preempted. <em>Bates, </em>544 U.S. at 453,125 S.Ct. 1788.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-9\">What is commonly referred to as \u201ctap water\u201d is known in FDCA terminology as a \u201ccommunity water system\u201d and defined as \u201ca public water system which serves at least 15 service connections used by year-round residents or regularly serves at least 25 year-round residents.\u201d 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 141.2. The parties agree that although bottled water originating from a community water system generally must be labeled \u201cfrom a community water system\u201d or \u201cfrom a municipal source,\u201d the applicable standard of identity explicitly exempts from this source disclosure requirement water meeting the definition of purified drinking water. 21 C.F.R. \u00a7 165.110(a)(3)(h). Nevertheless, Plaintiffs contend that Defendants may be held liable under state law for failing to disclose the source of <em>Aquafina </em>water because: (1) the FDCA is silent on whether the exemp<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>tion of purified water from the source disclosure requirement is applicable where misrepresentations as to source are made on the label; and (2) notwithstanding the exemption provision, the FDCA prohibits misrepresentations as to the source of all bottled water, including water meeting the definition of purified water. (Pis.\u2019 Opp\u2019n 8.) These arguments cannot prevail in light of the FDCA\u2019s statutory framework and regulatory history, which reveal that the FDA specifically addressed the disclosure of source information and determined, in its expert opinion, that representations of source are immaterial in the context of purified water.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-4\">Prior to the enactment of the current standard of identity for the various types of bottled water products, all such products, with the exception of \u201cmineral water\u201d and \u201csoda water,\u201d were known as \u201cbottled water,\u201d and were subject to the same quality standards as set forth by the Environmental Protection Agency in its general requirements for drinking water. Beverages: Bottled Water, 58 Fed.Reg. 393, 393 (Jan. 5, 1993). On January 20, 1988, the International Bottled Water Association submitted a petition requesting that the FDA revise the standards of quality for bottled water to include mineral water and more closely regulate the labeling, production, and distribution of bottled water by providing definitions for \u201cartesian water,\u201d \u201cdistilled water,\u201d \u201cmineral water,\u201d \u201cpurified water,\u201d \u201cspring water,\u201d and \u201cwell water.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 394. On January 6, 1989, the FDA published a final rule in which it commented that it \u201cd[id] not believe it necessary to include definitions for bottled waters from various water sources and produced by different treatments in the standard of quality for bottled water\u201d because the existing statutory authority was deemed \u201csufficient to provide for regulatory action in instances where false and misleading statements concerning the source or treatment of bottled water [were] made....\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting Nonalcoholic Beverages: Repeal of Soda Water Standard of Identity; Amendment of Bottled Water Quality Standard, 54 Fed.Reg. 398 (Jan. 6, 1989)).</p>\n<p id=\"b573-6\">The FDA reversed its position on January 5, 1993, announcing its intent to move the definition for bottled water from the existing quality standard to a standard of identity including definitions for the various types of bottled water in order to address, among other concerns, the bottled water industry\u2019s stated \u201cneed for uniform labeling standards to prevent or eliminate inconsistent State labeling requirements.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 395. In discussing the justifications for the proposed rule, the FDA noted the potential for misleading source representations made or implied by bottled water product labeling:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b573-7\">Often marketing and advertising associated with bottled water suggest that the \u201cwater comes from a tranquil, distant, utopian source\u201d [ ]. For example, a picture of a blue-green mountain spring on a label of a bottled water product may indicate to consumers that the water comes from a mountain spring. Such a label is misleading to consumers if the water actually comes from the municipal water supply of an urban area located far from any mountains</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b573-8\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b573-9\">Later in the same proposed rule, however, the FDA described, in consecutive paragraphs, the justification for the proposed \u201cmunicipal water supply\u201d source disclosure requirement and the reasoning behind the proposed exemption to that requirement for purified water:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b573-10\">FDA is proposing to require in \u00a7 165.110(a)(3)(ii) that the phrase \u201cfrom a municipal source\u201d appear on the principal display panel or panels as a part of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>the name of the food if the water is obtained from a municipal water supply, <em>except if the water has been treated to meet the de\u00f1nitions of distilled water or purified water and is labeled as such. </em>Information about the actual source of a bottled water product is a material fact in light of the either explicit (e.g., use of terms such as \u201cspring\u201d or \u201cwell\u201d) or implied (the presentation of the product in a bottle) representation made by a bottled water product that it is not tap water. Information about the source of the water is necessary to ensure that consumers do not incorrectly assume that because water is sold in a bottle, it does not come from a municipal water supply.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b574-4\">FDA is exempting municipal water that has been treated to meet the definition of \u201cpurified\u201d or \u201cdistilled water\u201d and is labeled as such because <em>consumers purchase this water because of its treatment and subsequent purity rather than because of its source. </em>In addition, there are no significant compositional differences among purified and distilled waters, regardless of the source of the water.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b574-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 399 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b574-6\">After soliciting feedback on its proposed rule and receiving approximately 430 responses over the course of a six-month comment period from various trade and retail associations, government organizations, manufacturers, consumers, health care professionals, retailers, consumer groups, State groups, private organizations, the U.S. Congress, professional societies, and universities, the FDA published its final rule on bottled water on November 13, 1995. Beverages: Bottled Water, 60 Fed.Reg. 57,076 (Nov. 13, 1995). Responding to a comment stating that \u201cit would be misleading if a country setting is shown on the label, including lakes or ponds, and the product is drinking water processed from municipal supplies via reverse osmosis systems [i.e., purified water],\u201d the FDA responded:<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"AlN\">FDA agrees that the use of certain graphics on a label of bottled water may be misleading to consumers if the source of the water is different than the source depicted or implied. For example, a country setting on a label may mislead consumers into believing that the product is spring water when it is not. Section 403(a) of the act specifically states that a food shall be deemed to be mis-branded if its labeling is false or misleading in any particular. <em>If a product is from a community water system, the label must clearly disclose this fact except as provided in \u00a7 165.110(a)(3)(H).</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b574-10\"><em>Id. </em>at 57,104 (emphasis added).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Section 165.110(a)(3)(ii) is the section that explicitly exempts purified water from the source disclosure requirement. Thus, while it is clear that the FDA contemplated that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>marketing techniques could potentially mislead consumers into believing that bottled water sourced from municipal supplies was actually \u201cspring water,\u201d it is also evident that the FDA determined that such concerns are irrelevant in the context of purified water. Indeed, the final rule is replete with evidence that, in contrast to spring water, the FDA concluded that because purified water, from whatever source, has been treated to meet purity standards, its source is immaterial to reasonable consumers. <em>See, e.g., </em>60 Fed.Reg. at 57088 (\u201c[W]ater that is labeled as \u2018purified water\u2019 should meet stricter standards than other types of bottled water because the term \u2018purified\u2019 asserts that the product has been processed to be of a purer quality than other types of water.\u201d); <em>id. </em>at 57089 (\u201c[P]urified water ... is chemically pure.\u201d); <em>id. </em>at 57103 (\u201cSource information for purified waters is not a material fact because the water may be significantly different in composition than other water from that particular source.\u201d); <em>id. </em>at 57104 (\u201c[T]here are no significant compositional differences between purified and distilled waters, regardless of the source of the water.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b575-4\">In sum, the FDA never intended or required that purified water include the \u201cmunicipal water supply\u201d disclosure required for certain other types of water, including spring water, and was not concerned with any misleading potential of graphics on bottles of purified water, based on its conclusion that with respect to purified water, the purification, and not the source, is the reason consumers buy it.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Consequently, Plaintiffs\u2019 claims are expressly preempted under both of their theories because: (1) federal law is not silent on the subject of implied labeling misrepresentations regarding the municipal source of bottled water; and (2) given that the <em>Aquafina </em>label fits within the exception for purified water and thus complies with the FDCA\u2019s requirements, Plaintiffs state law claims by necessity are premised on requirements that are not parallel to those imposed by federal law. Thus, because the state causes of action Plaintiffs wish to pursue would impose requirements in addition, and not identical, to federal requirements, they are preempted under Section 403A of the FDCA. <em>See Riegel, </em>128 S.Ct. at 1011 (state damages remedy permitted only to extent state duties parallel federal requirements).</p>\n<p id=\"b575-7\">Plaintiffs\u2019 rely heavily on <em>Vermont Pure </em>in their attempt to persuade the Court that their state law claims are not preempted. This reliance on that case, which is not binding in any event, is misplaced for multiple reasons:</p>\n<p id=\"b575-8\"><em>First, </em>unlike the source location claims at issue in <em>Vermont Pure, </em>Plaintiffs\u2019 state law claims alleging that Defendants\u2019 misrepresented the source of <em>Aquafina </em>water impose requirements that are not identical to the applicable standard of identity. In <em>Vermont Pure, </em>the court correctly held that Vermont Pure\u2019s state law claims regarding Nestle\u2019s alleged misrepresentations of the source of the \u201cspring water\u201d at issue could only survive preemption to the extent that they adopted the FDA definition of spring water. 2006 WL 839486, at *7, 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 13683, at *22. Indeed, the FDA standard of identity imposes detailed requirements on the use of the \u201cspring water\u201d nomenclature, including \u201cthe location of the spring.\u201d 21 C.F.R. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>\u00a7 165.110(a)(2)(vi). In contrast, the standard of identity for purified water is based solely on the \u201cdistillation, deionization, reverse osmosis or other suitable processes\u201d applied to the water, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 165.110(a)(2)(iv), and purified water is explicitly exempted from the \u201ccommunity water system\u201d disclosure requirement. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 165.110(a)(3)(ii). Thus, all the <em>Vermont Pure </em>court did was apply the \u201cparallel requirements\u201d test set forth in Bates: the federal regime for spring water had requirements for source disclosure, and the plaintiffs were permitted to proceed with a state cause of action to enforce those requirements. Here the standard of identity for purified water does not require the disclosure of source information, and therefore Plaintiffs\u2019 state law claims seeking to impose liability on these grounds are expressly preempted.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-5\"><em>Second, </em>unlike the \u201cpurity\u201d claims regarding the \u201cspring water\u201d at issue in <em>Vermont Pure, </em>which the court concluded were unaddressed by federal law, the federal standard of identity for \u201cpurified water\u201d explicitly regulates purity requirements. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 165.110(a)(2)(iv). Thus, the \u201cpurity\u201d field is not open as to purified water, as the <em>Vermont Pure </em>court held it was as to spring water. Here, Plaintiffs claim that Defendants\u2019 use of the term \u201cpure\u201d in the <em>Aquafina </em>labeling slogan \u201cPure Water \u2014 Perfect Taste\u201d is misleading to consumers because, when viewed in connection with the graphics on the label, it \u201cresults in misleading consumers into believing the source of the water is springs from snow-capped mountains, as opposed to public tap water.\u201d (Pis.\u2019 Opp\u2019n 10.) This argument fails to appreciate that although the FDA has \u201cdiscouraged\u201d the use of the term \u201cpure,\u201d it did so out of concern that consumers may be misled into believing that bottled water labeled as \u201cpure\u201d meets the processing standards required by the standard of identity for purified water. Beverages: Bottled Water, 60 Fed.Reg. 57,076, 57,099. Consumers cannot be misled in that fashion here, because <em>Aquafina is </em>purified water. In any event, Plaintiffs do not quarrel with the purity of <em>Aquafina. </em>(Pis.\u2019 Opp\u2019n 6.) Their focus on purity here is merely an attempt to re-cast their source argument, but the attempt is unavailing because: (1) the term \u201cpure\u201d has no source-specific meaning; and (2) source claims are, as discussed above, expressly preempted.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-8\"><em>Finally, </em>I reject Plaintiffs\u2019 reading of <em>Vermont Pure </em>to stand for the principle that state requirements are permitted as long as the federal standard does not specifically address the terms or images at issue. Where federal requirements address the subject matter that is being challenged through state law claims, such state law claims are preempted to the extent they do not impose identical requirements. Thus, although the standard of identity does not define the term \u201cpure\u201d or specify when it is permissible to place a cartoon-like image of a mountain range on a purified water label, the FDA considered misrepresentations regarding source and chose to regulate the labeling requirements for the disclosure of source information, and in so doing it determined that purified water should be exempted. Accordingly, any state law claims premised on a misrepresentation about the source of purified water are preempted.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b576-9\">In essence, Plaintiffs would have me construe the term \u201cnot identical to\u201d in Section 403A as permitting state requirements that go beyond federal law as long <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>as federal law does not expressly prohibit or permit the specific labeling at issue. I construe the term according to its plain meaning (a construction supported by the relevant regulations): where the product is the subject of a federal standard of identity, state requirements are not permitted unless they are identical to federal standards. <em>Aquafina </em>meets the federal standards regarding source disclosure for purified water, and thus this action is preempted. One might find it hard to believe, as Plaintiffs do, that Congress intended to preempt state law claims and prevent recourse for potentially misleading implications about the source of purified drinking water <em>(see </em>Pis.\u2019 Opp\u2019n 7), but as the Supreme Court explained in <em>Riegel, </em>\u201cthis is exactly what a pre-emption clause ... does by its terms.\u201d 128 S.Ct. at 1009. Because Plaintiffs\u2019 claims are expressly preempted, Defendants\u2019 Motion to Dismiss must be granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-5\">In light of the above, I need not address Defendants\u2019 arguments that Plaintiffs\u2019 claims are impliedly preempted or that the Complaint fails to meet the pleading requirements of various state laws under which they assert causes of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-6\">III. <em>Conclusion</em></p>\n<p id=\"b577-7\">It is hereby ORDERED that Defendants\u2019 Motion to Dismiss Plaintiffs\u2019 Consolidated Class Action Complaint is GRANTED.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-8\">The Clerk of Court is respectfully directed to determine the pending motion (Doc. 8), and close the classes.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-9\">SO ORDERED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b566-10\">.
