She contends that the book invades her \u201cright of privacy.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b299-14\">A judge of the Superior Court \u201creceived for . . . detailed study a copy of the book, [and] continued . . . [a] restraining order.\u201d He later determined that \u201cthe existence ... of the so-called . . . right of privacy in . . . Massachusetts underlay the . . . maintenance of the . . . [bill] and had not as yet been determined.\u201d He reported the case to this court for determination of three questions of law, viz. (1) whether a common law right of privacy exists in Massachusetts; (2) if such a right does exist, a statement of \u201cthe elements of and defenses to [such] a cause of action\u201d; and (3) whether the facts alleged show invasion of such a right.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>The bill alleges certain facts which Mrs. Boyd admits. Miss Frick, prior to World War I, founded in Beverly a vacation retreat for working girls (the home) \u201cand privately , . . supported it as a personal charity until . . . [it] was turned over to The Girls\u2019 Clubs of America, Inc. in 1954.\u201d Mrs. Boyd \u201cwas for many years an employee of the . . . [home] and in that capacity came to know\u201d Miss Frick. In 1964, Mrs. Boyd \u201cprivately had [the book] printed . . . for public sale and distribution in an initial edition of\u201d about 1,000 copies. The book, published without Miss Frick\u2019s consent, includes a \u201crecounting of . . . [Mrs. Boyd\u2019s] years\u201d at the home. Mrs. Boyd paid most of the printing expense \u201cbut still owes some money for\u201d that work. Miss Frick had no knowledge that Mrs. Boyd was writing the book (but Mrs. Boyd asserts in her answer that she tried without success to inform Miss Frick about it). Upon receiving a copy Miss Frick notified Mrs. Boyd \u201cthat she strenuously objected to the book . . . and demanded that all further sale and distribution of the book be . . . stopped.\u201d Mrs. Boyd disregarded Miss Frick\u2019s objections and has sold copies of the book to the general public for $4.95 a copy for \u201cgain and profit.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b300-5\">Miss Frick further alleges facts, which (doubtless because of the form of, and the conclusions in, the allegations) Mrs. Boyd\u2019s counsel felt it appropriate for her to deny. These allegations include the following. Miss Frick \u201cendeavored to insure that her support ... of the . . . [home] be a private and personal activity.\u201d She asserts that the \u201cfacts . . . relating to this activity were the concern only of those . . . involved directly with the operation . . . and that . . . [her] connection with the home . . . [was] a private matter in which the public had no legitimate concern.\u201d Miss Frick has \u201cinsofar as possible [lived] a quiet and private life, avoiding the prying curiosity of the public.\u201d All this \u201cwas and is . . . fully understood by\u201d Mrs. Boyd. Miss Frick further avers that the book, the reproduction therein of photographs of Miss Frick and letters from her, and the sale of the book con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>stitute \u201can . . . unwarranted appropriation of . . . [her] personality\u201d and an \u201cinvasion\u201d of her \u201cright of privacy\u201d which has caused her \u201cmental suffering, anguish, shame, humiliation, demeanment, not only in her own mind . . . but also in her . . . standing among others and all persons of ordinary sensibility,\u201d who may read the book.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-5\">The book itself has been incorporated by the trial judge in his report. The dust jacket says that the author, a former social worker, in 1964 was in her eighty-seventh year. In 1909, she met Miss Frick. Thereafter Mrs. Boyd participated as an employee for some thirty years in the work of Miss Frick\u2019s commendable vacation home for girls. The home started out by assisting a small number of deserving young women, but it grew rapidly.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b301-6\">The book starts out with a reminiscent account of Mrs. Boyd\u2019s childhood in Medfield, of incidents of her youth, of her church interests, and of her social service work. The account, although obviously not the work of an experienced author, is written with dignity and apparent sincerity. People mentioned are spoken of in terms of gentle kindliness.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-7\">Members of the Frick family first appear significantly in this 181 page volume at page 101. The account thereafter refers frequently, and always with enthusiasm and gratitude, to Miss Frick\u2019s generosity, her sense of social duty, and her unselfishness, and to the significance of her charitable enterprise.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Except by discussing Miss Frick\u2019s and her father\u2019s generosity to the home and to the author, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>telling of Miss Frick\u2019s active part in the home\u2019s affairs, there is slight comment on the Frick family. We perceive nothing- which could reasonably tend to lower Miss Frick in the esteem of her friends or the general public. \u25a0 On the contrary, we think, the book would lead its readers to recognize the importance and usefulness of Miss Frick\u2019s charitable efforts and to share Mrs. Boyd\u2019s gratitude for Miss Frick\u2019s benefactions and good works. We recognize, of course, that Miss Frick modestly would have preferred to have no such published recognition of her charitable activity; It is not probable that those examining the book will think that Miss Frick had any share in its preparation.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b302-5\">' We conclude that the book is a proper, albeit somewhat rambling, autobiographical volume. In a limited way it is of historical interest. Naturally the author speaks of her thirty years of work with Miss Frick, by far her most important experience. In that fine work, as Miss Frick herself recognized (fn. 1), Mrs. Boyd made a significant contribution. Mrs. Boyd could properly describe fairly her contacts with the Fricks and others in the course of that work.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-6\">The venture was the type of charity usually treated as sufficiently important to the public welfare to justify tax exemption of its properties and income tax deductions for gifts made to it. See G. L. c. 59, \u00a7 5, Third, as amended through St. 1957, c. 500, \u00a7 1; Int. Bev. Code of 1954, \u00a7 170. Accounts of such a venture may be of legitimate interest to persons among the general public, including those who concern themselves with such institutions or are potential or past donors to them or beneficiaries of their activities. Nothing in'Mrs. Boyd\u2019s account of Miss Frick seems to us <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>to go unreasonably outside appropriate discussion of her participation in a quasi public charitable enterprise.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-5\">The book cannot be regarded as a usual commercial venture or as having been undertaken with any reasonable purpose or expectation of profit. Its contents are not likely to have any wide public appeal beyond Mrs. Boyd\u2019s family and friends and persons legitimately interested in the home. If, as is alleged, copies have been offered for sale, we properly may infer that it was with the hope of modest receipts to help in defraying publication costs. Miss Frick \u201cacknowledges that the book . . . does not contain anything . . . defamatory.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b303-6\">The Massachusetts cases have not involved situations maldng it necessary to decide whether and to what extent any nonstatutory right of privacy exists within the Commonwealth. <em>Thayer </em>v. <em>Worcester Post Co. </em>284 Mass. 160, 163. <em>Marek </em>v. <em>Zanol Prod. Co. </em>298 Mass. 1. <em>Themo </em>v. <em>New England Newspaper Publishing Co. </em>306 Mass. 54, 55 (where it was said, \u201cGreat difficulty exists in defining a right of privacy that will protect individuals against abuse and yet will not infringe the right of the public and the press to discuss personalities\u201d). <em>Kelley </em>v. <em>Post Publishing Co. </em>327 Mass. 275, 277-278. See, however, <em>Wright </em>v. <em>R. K. O. Radio Pictures, Inc. </em>55 F. Supp. 639, 641 (D. Mass.). See also <em>Sperry Rand Corp. </em>v. <em>Hill, </em>356 F. 2d 181 (1st Cir.).</p>\n<p id=\"b303-7\">In the <em>Thayer </em>case, 284 Mass. 160, 164, a distasteful and potentially defamatory publication was spoken of as not relating \u201cto violations of privacy which would involve acts in the nature of nuisance.\u201d In the <em>Kelley </em>case, 327 Mass. 275, 278, it was said, \u201cThe law does not provide a remedy for every annoyance that occurs in everyday life. Many things which are distressing or may be lacking in propriety or good taste are not actionable.\u201d In that case, concerning a publication likely to have greater circulation, and to cause more poignant distress, than the book now before us, we said concerning privacy, \u201c [I]f there is such a right in this Commonwealth we would not be prepared to extend it to a case like the present.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b304-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>Despite the exhaustive collection and discussion of pertinent authorities in the briefs of the parties,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> we need not consider them. It will be time enough to appraise these authorities and to deal with difficult questions<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> presented by the assertion of such a right, when and if we are confronted with some substantial, serious, or indecent intrusion upon the private life of another. This inoffensive book presents no such situation.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-5\">We need not answer the first two questions raised by the report. We hold, in answer to the third question, that the book and the facts alleged or disclosed by the report show no basis for equitable relief based upon the invasion of an assumed right of privacy. Mrs. Boyd is to be allowed costs in respect of the report to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b301-8\"> By 1940 the institution (in Miss Frick's own words in her letter to its members upon Mrs. Boyd's retirement in that year) had \u201cbecome for many the only place on earth that can be called \u2018 [h]ome,\u2019 and because of Mrs. Boyd's genius, this [h]ome has been the inspirational source for greater ambition and greater effort along many lines. It would be impossible to estimate how many lives have been changed because of her [Mrs. Boyd\u2019s] unselfish interest, devotion, and untiring energy.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b301-9\"> There are photographs of activities of the home, and three wholly dignified pictures of Miss Frick in earlier years. One is a snapshot owned by the author, one a pleasant and somewhat formal photograph of Miss Frick and another young lady apparently given by Miss Frick to the author, and one a newspaper photographer\u2019s picture taken during World War I when Miss'Frick undertook volunteer service in France.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b302-7\"> a There is only slight quotation of Miss Frick\u2019s letters. One, already mentioned (fn. 1), was plainly generally circulated in 1940 to a number of members of the corporation which conducted the home. One was a short note written to Mrs. Boyd in 1940, making or referring to a thoughtful, kind gift to her upon her retirement. It was the type of letter which the writer might reasonably expect the recipient in gratitude to show to many friends and relatives. It reveals nothing of Miss Frick\u2019s own affairs or her character beyond her generosity.' Its publication, even if without permission, is plainly of insufficient significance to warrant equitable relief or damages.'</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b304-7\"> See, for general discussion of possible protection of privacy, Bestatement: Torts, \u00a7 867; Prosser, Torts (3d ed.) \u00a7 112; Harper and James, Torts, \u00a7\u00a7 9.6-9,7; Winfield, Torts (6th ed.) \u00a7 7, p. 16; \u00a7 183; Hofstadter and Horowitz, The Bight of Privacy; Prosser, Privacy, 48 Cal.
