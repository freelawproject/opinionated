The facts are stated in accordance with a stipulation upon the basis of which the board made findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-11\">The trustee, an inhabitant of Massachusetts, pursuant to the 1955 trust agreement, created by an inhabitant of Massachusetts, is to expend for the benefit of Anne Bick-ford, a minor residing in California in 1958 and now, so much of the net income and principal of the trust property as the trustee may determine. Any unexpended income may be accumulated and reinvested. When Anne attains the age of twenty-one years, the trustee is to pay the re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>maining \"balance of the trust property, if any, together with any unpaid, accrued income, to Anne free of any trust. If she shall die prior to attaining the age of twenty-one years, the trustee is to distribute the remaining trust property and unpaid, accrued income in all respects as Anne may by will appoint. In default of such appointment, such trust property and accrued income are to he paid to Anne\u2019s estate. The trustee is given usual trust powers. The trust is to be construed in accordance with the laws of Massachusetts.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-5\">The trustee in 1958 received dividends and interest amounting to $178.81. He did not pay out this income hut accumulated it. The trustee in his income tax return (form 2 for 1958, filed in 1959) reported this income as not being subject to tax because accumulated for an ascertained beneficiary who was not a resident of Massachusetts. The commission assessed to the trustee a tax upon the income so accumulated. The tax has been paid.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-6\">The commission denied the trustee\u2019s application for abatement of this tax. The trustee then appealed to the board. The applicable provisions of the income tax statute are set out in the margin.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b610-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>We have recently had occasion to discuss the income taxation of trustees in Massachusetts and to review its history. <em>Dexter </em>v. <em>State Tax Commn. ante, </em>380, 383-385, esp. fn. 6. We there pointed out that, since the beginning of the Massachusetts income tax in 1916, the legislative policy has been to impose taxes upon the income received by Massachusetts trustees only when the beneficiary to whom such income is payable, or for whom it is accumulated, has a domicil in Massachusetts. Our income tax (G. L. c. 62, \u00a7 10; see fn. 1, <em>supra) </em>\u201cdoes not impose a tax upon income from a trust that is payable to inhabitants of other States.\u201d See 1916 House Doc. No. 1700, pp. 51-52.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-5\">In <em>Second Bank-State St. Trust Co. </em>v. <em>State Tax Commn. </em>337 Mass 203, 209, we recognized that, by \u00a7 10 (see the language italicized in \u00a7 10 as quieted in fn. 1), certain persons or interests have been treated as \u201cequivalent to an inhabitant\u201d in respect of the income tax upon certain Massachusetts trustees. Such persons are \u201cunascertained persons, or persons with uncertain interests,\u201d but these do not include persons in being in whom \u201ca remainder [interest is] presently vested\u201d which is \u201cnot subject to be divested by the happening of any contingency expressly mentioned in the instrument creating the trust. \u2019 \u2019 For the history of this provision, see Nichols, Taxation in Massachusetts (3d ed.) 513-518; Barrett and Bailey, Taxation, \u00a7\u00a7 607, 614. See also \u00a7 620.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-6\">The purpose of the 1955 trust is obviously to provide the vehicle for one or more annual gifts by the donor for the benefit of Anne in a manner which will avoid a Federal gift tax upon such gifts, by bringing them within Int. Rev. Code of 1954 (26 U. S. C. [1964]) \u00a7 2503 (c).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> That section <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>states the terms upon which a gift in trust or otherwise to, or for the benefit of, a minor may comply with the section\u2019s annual $3,000 exclusion from gift tax. Since \u00a7 2503 requires that, to qualify for the exclusion, there in effect must be in the donee a present beneficial interest in the subject of the gift, we think that the donor intended to give to Anne as complete a vested beneficial interest in the trust property as would be consistent with the existence of a trust continuing until Anne reaches the age of twenty-one or dies under that age. See Stiott, Trusts (2d ed.) \u00a7 128.2. The accomplishment of identifiable tax objectives of this character frequently may be an aid to the interpretation of trust instruments (see e.g. <em>New England Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Faxon, </em>343 Mass. 273, 276, n. 3), and, so far as may be reasonably consistent with the language of the instrument and applicable legal principles, we should give effect to the intention, thus disclosed, of the party or parties to the instrument.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-4\">Anne has been given the complete beneficial interest in the trust property while she is under the age of twenty-one and an outright legal interest at that age. If she dies under that age, (a) she may dispose of the property by will, if she has the capacity to make one (see G. L. c. 191, \u00a7 1, by which a Massachusetts testator must be \u201cof full age\u201d as well as of \u201csound mind\u201d.; Newhall, Settlement of Estates [4th ed.] \u00a7 336; cf. Deering\u2019s California Codes, Probate, \u00a7 20 [1959], which permits a person over the age of eighteen years to make a will), and (b) in default of such an appointment, the property will go to Anne\u2019s estate. There is no trust provision which operates to divest Anne of the beneficial interest in the trust. If Anne loses the beneficial interest because of her death while a minor, Anne\u2019s estate will take the trust property outright, unless Anne has effectively disposed of the property by the exercise of her general testamentary power of appointment. That power she alone can exercise. Her possession of that power does not make her interest \u201cuncertain\u201d but tends to augment it and to make it more complete by removing any doubt concerning her power to dispose of it by will, if the exercise of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>testamentary power of appointment by a nonresident minor \u2019s will can be recognized in Massachusetts, a point which we need not now decide or discuss. See Restatement 2d: Conflict of Laws (Tent, draft No. 13, 1965) \u00a7 1007 (b) and comment c. See reporter\u2019s note, p. 82. See also Newhall, Settlement of Estates (4th ed.) \u00a7 365.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-5\">The commission rests its contention that Anne\u2019s interest is contingent or \u201cuncertain\u201d primarily upon the existence of Anne\u2019s testamentary power of appointment. In <em>Commissioner of Corps. &amp; Taxn. </em>v. <em>Baker, </em>303 Mass. 606, 612-613, the gift in default of the exercise of a testamentary power of appointment was not to the nonresident donee\u2019s heirs determined at her death in accordance with the laws of her domicil, but was to the persons who would have taken the donee\u2019s personal property by intestacy under the laws 'of Massachusetts at the death, not of the donee, but of another person, a life beneficiary.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> An accumulation of factors led this court in the <em>Baker </em>case to treat the donee\u2019s interest as one depending upon the donee\u2019s surviving a prior life beneficiary, and as taxable under c. 62, \u00a7 10. In the present case, however, nothing about the existence of Anne\u2019s power of appointment has any tendency to detract from Anne\u2019s vested interest or to suggest that the interest is in any sense contingent. Instead the power of appointment supports recognition of Anne\u2019s Complete beneficial and vested interest in the 1955 trust res. See <em>Commissioner of Corps. &amp; Taxn. </em>v. <em>Second Natl. Bank, </em>308 Mass. 1, 5-6.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We find nothing inconsistent with our view of the present trust in other cases relied upon by the commission. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>See <em>Warren </em>v. <em>Bears, </em>303 Mass. 578, 583; <em>Loring </em>v. <em>Clapp, </em>337 Mass. 53, 60.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-5\">The Appellate Tax Board correctly concluded (a) that Anne\u2019s interest in the trust property (and the interests of certain other nonresident minors<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> in the trust res under similar trusts for their benefit, respectively) was \u201cvested,\u201d and \u201cnot subject to divestment on a contingency mentioned in the trusts,\u201d and (b) that the income tax on the 1958 income of Anne\u2019s trust (and of the other similar trusts) must be abated.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-6\">In respect of the case concerning Anne\u2019s trust, and in each of the other cases governed by the outstanding stipulation (fn. 5), the following entry will be made,</p>\n<p id=\"b613-7\">\n<em>Decision affirmed with costs to the trustee.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b609-7\"> General Laws c. 62, \u00a7 10 (as amended through St. 1957, e. 644, \u00a7 3), reads: <em>\u2018 \u2018 </em>The income received by trustees . . . shall be taxed in the following manner: (a) The income received by trustees . . . described in subsection (c) of this section shall be subject to the taxes imposed by this chapter to the extent that the persons to whom the same is payable, or for whose benefit it is accumulated, are inhabitants of the commonwealth ....
