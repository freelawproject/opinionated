The Commissioner seeks an injunction to restrain the defendants from \u201cdumping or disposing of refuse\u201d in the town dump in violation of an order of the Department of Public Health of the Commonwealth (department), and seeks to have Boceo \u201cordered to cover . . . [the] dumping area with at least two feet of clean earth.\u201d The board and the selectmen appealed from a final decree which stated in pertinent part that \u201cthe Town of Tewksbury and the defendants are to operate the dump in accordance with the sanitary land fill method within thirty days of its [sic] next regularly scheduled town meeting. In the event the dump is not so operated, or thereafter shall cease to be so operated, the order of the Department of Public Health closing the dump shall forthwith become operative and thereupon the defendants and the said Town shall be and hereby are restrained and enjoined from using the . . . dump and from allowing or causing it to be operated.\u201d The trial judge made \u201cFindings of Facts Bul-ings and Order for Decree\u201d and the evidence is reported.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-5\">The judge found that \u201c [c] omplaints concerning the operation and effect of the dump on some people in the area of the dump were made to the State Department of Public Health. . . . [E]xamination by the sanitary engineer from the Department of Public Health disclosed rodent infestation (rats) flies and smoke.\u201d After a public hearing, the department found \u201cThat the operation of the dump results in a nuisance and a danger to public health\u201d and \u201crequired that the dump be operated strictly in accordance with Sanitary Landfilled method.\u201d The town refused to operate the dump in the required manner, and the department ordered the dump closed.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-6\">The Commissionfer contends that \u201cthe only issue before the Superior Court . . . was whether the administrative decision concerning the dump was within the agency\u2019s jurisdiction.\u201d We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-7\">G-eneral Laws c. Ill, \u00a7 150A, inserted by St. 1955, c. 310, \u00a7 1, provides in part that \u201cThe assignment of any place as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>a dumping ground . . . may be modified through the imposition or amendment of conditions, at any time after due notice and public hearing, ... by the department upon determination that the dumping ground . . . results in a nuisance and a danger to the public health. \u2019 \u2019 The department fulfilled all these requirements and, therefore, the decision was within its authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-5\">General Laws c. Ill, \u00a7 150A, also provides that \u201cThe superior court shall have jurisdiction in equity to enforce the provisions of this section upon petition of the department or any person aggrieved.\u201d As we stated in <em>Sisters of the Holy Cross of Mass. </em>v. <em>Brookline, </em>347 Mass. 486, 491, \u201c \u2018The ordinary meaning of \u201cenforce\u201d is \u201cto compel obedience to,\u201d \u201cto cause tobe executed.\u201d \u2019 . . . [A] grant of specific equity jurisdiction . . . must be strictly construed.\u201d Jurisdiction in equity to enforce the provisions of \u00a7 150A does not expand the jurisdiction of the courts under this section to review the basis for the administrative decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-7\">\u201cThe record suggests no reason why the . . . [defendants] should not either have complied promptly with . . . [the department\u2019s] decision or have sought review under G. L. c. 30A.\u201d <em>Department of Pub. Welfare </em>v. <em>Billerica, ante, </em>56, 57. The decree enforcing the decision of the department was proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-8\">\n<em>Decree affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
