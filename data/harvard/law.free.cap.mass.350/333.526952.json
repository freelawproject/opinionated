Decrees were entered on the libel and on the petitions. John has appealed three of the four decrees all of which were entered on July 6, 1964. There is no appeal by Laura from any of these decrees. On November 22, 1963, John filed a libel for divorce against Laura for cruel and abusive treatment. On December 13, 1963, Laura sought an order to restrain John from dealing with bank accounts and securities held in their names jointly and to have him account for and deliver to her fifty per cent of all such holdings. On January 16, 1964, John brought a petition in equity to determine title to personal property, including household furnishings and the jointly held securities and bank accounts. Finally, on April 16, 1964, Laura petitioned for separate support, alleging that she was living apart from John for justifiable cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-9\">The judge dismissed John\u2019s libel for divorce. John appealed. The evidence is reported. It was oral and conflicting. The judge made a report of material facts. He apparently believed one spouse rather than the other. We cannot say that he was plainly wrong. <em>Hiller </em>v. <em>Hiller, </em>305 Mass. 163, 165. <em>Hamilton </em>v. <em>Hamilton, </em>325 Mass. 278, 279, and cases cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-12\">On Laura\u2019s petition for separate support, the evidence is reported. The judge made findings of fact. He allowed Laura $100 a week for herself and her minor daughter, along with all medical, dental, hospital, fuel, mortgage and real property tax expenses. This determination rests in the judge\u2019s discretion as exercised in light of all the circumstances attending the husband\u2019s worth and the wife\u2019s legitimate\u2022 needs. <em>Wilson </em>v. <em>Wilson, </em>329 Mass. 208, 211. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>We cannot say that he was plainly wrong in the exercise of his discretion. <em>Klar </em>v. <em>Klar, </em>322 Mass. 59, 60. Compare <em>Hillery </em>v. <em>Hillery, </em>342 Mass. 371.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-5\">John has appealed from the decree dismissing his petition for a determination of his ownership of bank accounts, securities and household furnishings. This decree, on its face, is inconsistent with the unappealed dismissal of Laura\u2019s equity petition against John in so far as both petitions affected jointly held bank accounts and securities. Our examination of the original papers shows that John\u2019s petition was dismissed through inadvertence, that a so called \u201ccorrected\u201d decree, determining that John had title to the bank accounts and securities, was entered subsequent to the filing of papers on appeal in this court, and that Laura claimed an appeal from this \u201ccorrected\u201d decree.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-6\">The orderly administration of justice requires that the following action be taken. The 1 *corrected\u201d decree entered by the judge on John\u2019s petition is to be expunged. <em>Enterprises, Inc. </em>v. <em>Cardinale, </em>331 Mass. 244, 246. Laura\u2019s claim of appeal from the \u201ccorrected\u201d decree should therefore also be expunged. The decree dismissing John\u2019s petition in equity is to be vacated. The judge is to enter a new final decree based on the facts found by him and not inconsistent with the decree on Laura\u2019s petition in equity.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-7\">The decrees dismissing the libel for divorce and allowing separate support are affirmed. The case is remanded to the Probate Court for further action by the judge on John\u2019s petition in equity as indicated by this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-8\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
