At issue is the right of the defendants to use a private way on the plaintiffs\u2019 land, adjacent to the southerly side line of the defendants\u2019 property. In the defendants\u2019 chain of title is a deed dated March 27, 1893, that describes the premises in part <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>as follows: \u201cBeginning at the northeasterly corner . . . thence southerly by and along said road ... to a private way separating other land of the grantors; thence by and with said private way 89 feet more or less . . .. \u201d The deed also provides that \u201c [i]t is a condition of this deed that the grantors and their assigns shall forever keep open said private way for the use of teams or otherwise for the benefit of grantee.\u201d The habendum reads: \u201cTo have and to hold the granted premises, with all the privileges and appurtenances thereto belonging, to the said . . . [grantee] and his heirs and assigns, to their own use and behoof forever.\u201d This deed created an easement that ran with the land. The judge\u2019s ruling that it was limited to the immediate grantee was error. The absence of the words \u201cand his heirs and assigns\u201d after the words \u201cfor the benefit of the grantee\u201d in the description of the easement is inconsequential. \u201cIt is the function of the habendum to declare the extent of the estate conveyed.\u201d <em>Brooks </em>v. <em>West Boston Gas Co. </em>260 Mass. 407, 409.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-5\">The deed does not, as the judge ruled, show an intent to create only a limited personal right. The use of the word \u201cforever\u201d in stating the obligation of \u201cthe grantors and their assigns\u201d to keep open the private way negatives any such implication, even if it could otherwise be thought present in the light of the habendum. \u2022</p>\n<p id=\"b575-6\">Additionally, the description of the parcel as bounded on the private way confirmed the creation of an easement of passage. <em>Murphy </em>v. <em>Mart Realty of Brockton, Inc. </em>348 Mass. 675, 677-678.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-7\">The absence of a reference to the right of way in intervening deeds did not release it. The well settled rule that appurtenant easements pass by grant without specific mention <em>(Brown </em>v. <em>Thissell, </em>6 Cush. 254, 257) was made statutory by St. 1912, e. 502, \u00a7 21, now in substance Gr. L. c. 183, \u00a7 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-8\">The final decree is reversed. A decree is to enter declaring that the right of way is appurtenant to the defendants\u2019 land. The defendants are to have costs of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-9\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
