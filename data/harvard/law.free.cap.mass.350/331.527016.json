The defendant, having waived his right to a trial by jury, was tried by a judge of the Superior Court who found him guilty on eight counts. The case is here on the defendant\u2019s exception to the denial of his request for a ruling \u201cthat the evidence was insufficient to warrant a conviction.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b371-15\">There was evidence that the defendant was \u201cemployed by the Department of Public Works (Waterways Division) of the Commonwealth during 1959 and early 1960, as a temporary inspectai of certain improvements in Wellfleet Harbor, then in process.\u201d He signed weekly pay vouchers, \u201ceach showing a total of forty hours for five days of eight hours per day, for the weeks of October 10, 17, 24, 31, November 7,14, 21, 1959, and the week of January 9, 1960, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>and he was paid $59.41 for each such week.\u201d During this period the defendant was also employed as a \u201cspecial sheriff and Court Officer\u201d in the county of Barnstable. In this latter position the defendant \u201chad to attend Court each Court day at 10 a.m. and . . . the customary Court hours were from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m.\u201d The court house is forty miles from Wellfleet where the defendant resided and where he was employed as a temporary inspector. His immediate supervisor, Thomas Sheehan, and Francis Graham, a construction engineer for the Waterways Division testified that the working hours of the inspectors were the working hours of the contractors for the several jobs comprising the Well-fleet operation. Graham stated that the working hours \u201cvary from 7 a.m. to 3:30 p.m., and from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m., and unless there was overtime, a temporary inspector would not have evening duties. In 1959, the latest work he knew about occurred between 6 and 7 p.m.\u201d The construction supervisor on one of the jobs at Wellfleet said that he \u201csaw defendant on the wharf at various times, sometimes at night, but never for eight hours on his contract, which operated from 7:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m.\u201d Another inspector on the Wellfleet job testified that \u201cno Inspector was assigned at night to his knowledge.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b372-4\">We are of opinion that this evidence was sufficient for the judge to conclude that the defendant failed to work the forty hours each week which he claimed on his voucher.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-5\">The defendant argues that he \u201cfully disclosed his commitments to each employer, and neither was deceived . . ..\u201d His \u201ctime vouchers and the propriety of his conduct have not been questioned by his superiors at the Well-fleet jobs [and] Sheehan, who \u2018knew what was going on,\u2019 according to Graham, stated that defendant\u2019s services were satisfactory.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b372-6\">This argument ignores the fact that Sheehan testified that the defendant was required to work eight hours a day as an inspector for his services to be considered satisfactory. Sheehan said that he \u201chimself was . . . [on the job] only an hour each day. \u201d It is clear, therefore, that Shee-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>han did not know whether the defendant worked eight hours a day on the job as an inspector. Further, it is certainly obvious that the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, in paying the defendant for his alleged employment as an inspector, relied on the signed vouchers of the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-5\">There was no error in the denial of the defendant\u2019s request.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-6\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
