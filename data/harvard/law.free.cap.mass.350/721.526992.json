L. c. 269, \u00a7 10. The case comes to us on report (Gr. L. c. 278, \u00a7 30) of two questions: (1) Whether knowledge, actual or constructive, is a necessary element of the crime. (2) If it is, whether the fact that the firearms were in a vehicle owned and being operated by the defendant creates a case for the tribunal of fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-14\">The case was tried on stipulated facts. The defendant \u201cwas lawfully arrested\u201d about 11:15 p.m. on July 30,1965, in Somerville. Two firearms were found on the floor behind the driver\u2019s seat. She had no knowledge of their presence. The statute does not contain the word \u201cknowingly\u201d or its equivalent, and provides for a possible sen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"722\">*722</page-number>tence of two and one-half to five years \u201cin the state prison\u201d or for a shorter term in the house of correction.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-5\">\"Where conducive to justice, a court may set aside a stipulation made by the parties. <em>Loring </em>v. <em>Mercier, </em>318 Mass. 599, 601, and cases cited. This is the present situation. We feel strongly that the stipulated facts make a presentation not best suited for deciding the reported questions. The paramount issue of the defendant\u2019s knowledge is withdrawn from the field of practical affairs, where it appropriately belongs, and in substitution there is a question resembling one from a law examination. This blind record precludes the drawing of inferences from the circumstances of the arrest, including such important facts as the ground therefor, the exact place where it was made, where the defendant was coming from, where she was going, the identity of any passengers in the car, their relationship to the defendant, and the reason for their presence. The testimony of the officer or officers making the arrest and of perhaps others could furnish much significant information now lacking.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-6\">Accordingly, we set aside the stipulation, discharge the report, and remand the case to the Superior Court for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
