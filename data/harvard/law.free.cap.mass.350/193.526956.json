See G. L. c. 23A, \u00a7 3 (inserted by St. 1953, c. 409, \u00a7 1; see later amendment by St. 1964, c. 636, \u00a7 1). As of June 1, 1964, Reynolds had held this position for more than three years. On that day, he was suspended pursuant to G. L. c. 30, \u00a7 59 (as amended through St. 1963, e. 829, \u00a7\u00a7 1-2, later amended by St. 1964, c. 528), because of his indictment for violations of law (larceny), alleged by the commissioner to be \u201c of a nature ... to constitute misconduct in office.\u201d Reynolds was later found guilty and ordered to make restitution of $251.40. This he has done. He contends that he should not have been suspended except in accordance with G. L. c. 31, \u00a7\u00a7 43 and 45, because of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>protection given to veterans by G-. L. c. 30, \u00a7 9A, as amended through St. 1947, c. 242.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> He has appealed from an order sustaining a demurrer to the petition and from a so called \u201cfinal decree\u201d which we treat as an order for judgment dismissing the petition. See Gr. L. c. 213, \u00a7 ID, as amended through St. 1957, c. 155.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-5\"><em>Bessette </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Pub. Works, </em>348 Mass. 605, 608, established that \u00a7 59 (which affords the suspended employee reasonable protection if vindicated) permits suspension of persons subject to civil service without compliance with Gr. L. c. 31, \u00a7 43 (a), as amended, and related statutes. Reynolds, however, contends that application of \u00a7 59 to him impairs the obligation of the \u201ccontract\u201d governing his employment (see art. 1, \u00a7 10, of the Constitution of the United States), because he had served (see c. 30, \u00a7 9A) for more than three years. Whether he is regarded as a public officer <em>(Williams </em>v. <em>New Bedford, </em>303 Mass. 213, 214; <em>Nichols </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Pub. Welfare, </em>311 Mass. 125, 130-131), or as having essentially civil service rights (see <em>Matter of Eagan </em>v. <em>Livoti, </em>287 N. Y. 464, 468-469), we conclude that Reynolds possessed no such contractual right to his office as would prevent at least reasonable, nondiscriminatory legislative amendment, in the public interest and for a proper governmental purpose, of the incidents of the office and of the procedure for suspension from that office. The obvious public purpose of \u00a7 59, as we indicated in the <em>Bessette </em>case (pp. 608-609), was \u201cto protect the public interest,\u201d in the light of the \u201cindisputable fact of the indictment,\u201d from the inappropriate situation of having an official under indictment engaged in the duties of his office. Section 59 properly provides (p. 609) that \u201can official indicted for malfeasance in office . . . [shall] be separated from the office pending trial and, if convicted . . . [shall] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>have no right of reinstatement.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In effect, with respect to indicted officials like Reynolds, \u00a7 59 merely substitutes for the procedures of c. 31, \u00a7 43 (a), other procedures affording due process of law to the suspended official. The enactment of \u00a7 59 was clearly within the retained legislative power of regulation, even of existing contract arrangements, in the public interest. See Schwartz, Rights of Property, A Commentary on the Constitution, 283-287.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-4\"><em>Indiana ex rel. Anderson </em>v. <em>Brand, </em>303 U. S. 95, upon which Reynolds relies, recognizes (pp. 108-109) that \u201cevery contract is made subject to the implied condition that . . . [it] may be frustrated by a proper exercise of the police power . . . for an end which is in fact public . . . [by] means . . . reasonably adapted to that end.\u201d See <em>El Paso </em>v. <em>Simmons, </em>379 U. S. 497, 508-509. We think that \u00a7 59 fully complies with the standard thus stated in the <em>Anderson </em>case. In <em>Huntoon </em>v. <em>Quincy, </em>349 Mass. 9, on which Reynolds also relies to some extent, no question of legislative amendment of suspension procedures was presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-5\">\n<em>Order sustaining demurrer affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AUA\">\n<em>Order for judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b234-6\"> Section 9A reads, in part, \u201cA veteran . . . who holds an office or position in the service of the commonwealth not classified\u201d under c. 31 (with certain exceptions not here relevant) \u2018\u2018and has held such office or position for not less than three years, shall not he involuntarily separated from such office or position except ... in accordance with\u201d c. 31, \u00a7\u00a7 43 and 45, \u2018\u2018to the same extent as if said office or position were classified . . .. \u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b235-11\"> It is to be noted that, in the event of termination of the criminal proceedings Without a finding or verdict of guilty, the final paragraph of \u00a7 59 contains suitable provision for the suspended employee\u2019s protection. Since Reynolds was found guilty this paragraph is not here relevant.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
