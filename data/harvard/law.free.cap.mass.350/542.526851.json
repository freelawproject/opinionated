She sustained personal injuries in an accident while a guest in an automobile owned and operated by one Philip Clegg, whose only insurance was a compulsory motor vehicle liability policy required by Q-. L. c. 90, \u00a7\u00a7 34A-34J. There was a statement of agreed facts. \u201cCoverage U\u201d in the policy issued by the defendant to the plaintiff\u2019s father obligated the defendant to pay all sums which tfhe plaintiff would be legally entitled to recover as damages from the owner or operator \u201cof an uninsured automobile because of bodily injury, sickness or disease, including death resulting therefrom . . . sustained by the insured, caused by accident and arising out of the ownership, maintenance or use of such uninsured automobile . . .. \u201d The policy defined an uninsured automobile as \u201can automobile with respect to the ownership, maintenance or use of which there is no bodily injury liability bond or insurance policy <em>applicable </em>at the time of the accident with respect to any person or organization legally responsible for the use of such automobile ...\u201d (emphasis supplied). The issue before us is whether, since Clegg carried a compulsory policy on his automobile but made no provision against injuries to guests by means of either a bond or by insurance, it can be held that there was no \u201cbodily injury liability bond or insurance policy applicable at the time of the accident.\u201d Dictionary definitions of the word \u201capplicable\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>include the words \u201cfit,\u201d \u201csuitable,\u201d \u201cpertinent,\u201d \u201cappropriate,\u201d or \u201ccapable of being applied.\u201d In view of these definitions, it could be said that at the time of the accident Clegg\u2019s automobile was uninsured within the definition of the policy in that there was no bond or insurance with respect to him \u201ccapable of being applied\u201d to the bodily injuries of this plaintiff. There was at least ambiguity present in the definition of the \u201cuninsured automobile\u201d and \u201cany ambiguity must be resolved against the defendant. The contract was drawn by the defendant and it would have been an easy matter to state the provisions of the section in dispute in form and words which would leave no doubt as to its intent.\u201d <em>MacArthur </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Hosp.
