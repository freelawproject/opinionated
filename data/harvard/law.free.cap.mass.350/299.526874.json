L. e. 152, \u00a7 27) and thus barred from compensation.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-14\">We consider the appeal in the light of the established standard of review stated in <em>Hartman\u2019s Case, </em>336 Mass. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>508, 511. The single member found the following facts. On March 8,1963, Mercier reported at his place of employment, the Hayward-Schuster Woolen Mills, Inc. He was assigned to operate a \u201csemi-decatur,\u201d \u00e1 cloth-processing machine. Proper use of the machine required two flat, four-wheeled trucks, one to hold the cloth for feeding into the machine, the other to carry the cloth after processing. Employees could get these trucks somewhere in the department by looking for them.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-5\">Shortly after beginning work, Mercier looked for a truck to use with the one he already had so that he could operate his machine. He found one near a machine operated by a fellow-worker, Macuga, and took it to his own machine. Almost immediately, Macuga approached Mercier, spoke to him about the truck, jostled him slightly, and then returned to his own place. (It appears that Macuga was not aware that Mercier had taken the particular truck which had been near his machine.) At this point, Mercier noticed a nearby worker and close friend, one Biron, smiling. Thinking that Biron might tell Macuga about the truck, Mercier approached Biron, who was bending over a pile of cloth that had passed through his machine, placed his left arm around Biron\u2019s shoulder and over his chest, and his right hand over his mouth, saying, \u201cDon\u2019t talk! Don\u2019t talk!\u201d Surprised, Biron tumbled over, causing Mercier to fall and fracture his left femur. The single member concluded that the injury arose out of and in the course of Mercier\u2019s employment (G-. L. c. 152, \u00a7 26) and that compensation was not barred by any serious and wilful misconduct on his part (G-. L. c. 152, \u00a7 27).</p>\n<p id=\"b340-6\">We have read the evidence. It amply supports the facts found. The facts found provide, in turn, an adequate foundation for the conclusion reached. These facts show: the need for trucks in the operation for which Mercier was employed, the availability of trucks in the department where he worked, his taking of a truck to do his work, his steps to retain possession of it, and the consequent injury. It seems to us irrelevant that there was no evidence of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>custom which permitted one employee to take the truck of another. There was, in any event, evidence from Macuga that he usually used \u201cextra trucks.\u201d The factual conclusion that Mercier\u2019s acts were in the pursuit of his work was clearly supportable.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-5\">The insurer cannot prevail in its contention that the finding that Mercier\u2019s injury arose out of and in the course of his employment is erroneous in law because the injury was suffered while he was playing a joke on a fellow employee. That there was the element of a prank or joke involving Biron and Macuga in connection with Mercier\u2019s efforts to get and retain possession of a truck does not require the conclusion that his injury resulted \u201cfrom his own voluntary act which in no way pertains to his employment. \u2019 \u2019 <em>Mail-loux\u2019s Case, </em>328 Mass. 592, 594. Mercier\u2019s injury could be said to have flowed from an act which, although voluntary, was subordinate and incidental to and consistent with his main purpose which was the retention of the truck to do his work. \u201cAll that is required is that his activity be incidental to and not inconsistent with his employment.\u201d <em>Bator\u2019s Case, </em>338 Mass. 104, 106. Although the specific act which resulted in the injury was not an act which the employee was hired to do, we have held that it \u201cis enough if he is upon his employer\u2019s premises occupying himself consistently with his contract of hire in some manner pertaining to or incidental to his employment. \u2019 \u2019 <em>Souza's Case, </em>316 Mass. 332, 335, and cases cited. In the circumstances, Mercier\u2019s act arose out of and was in the course of his employment so that the injury sustained thereby is compen-sable under Gr. L. e. 152, \u00a7 26.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-6\">Finally, the insurer contends that the claim is barred because of Mercier\u2019s serious and wilful misconduct. Gr. L. c. 152, \u00a7 27. \u201cThe word serious refers to the conduct itself and not to its consequences.\u201d <em>Dillon\u2019s Case, </em>324 Mass. 102, 110. In view of the kinds of activity found not to be \u201cserious and wilful,\u201d as, for example, in <em>Blanchard\u2019s Case, </em>335 Mass. 175, it cannot be said that placing an arm over the shoulder and a hand over the mouth of a friendly fellow-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>worker is quasi-criminal conduct of the sort implied by the statutory words \u201cserious and wilful.\u201d See <em>Durgin\u2019s Case, </em>251 Mass. 427, 430.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-5\">The findings and decision of the single member, as approved by the reviewing board, were warranted by the evidence, were not erroneous in law, and are not affected by any serious and wilful misconduct by Mercier. The decree is affirmed. The single justice may allow costs of the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
