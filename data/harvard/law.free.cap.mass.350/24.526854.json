H. Rhodes, Incorporated (Rhodes). The petitioner, W. J. Manning, Inc. (Manning), appeals from the order of the Superior Court denying its petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-16\">The commission invited sealed bids for furnishing and installing meters in the city of Boston. Rhodes bid $465,930 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>and Manning bid $477,000. A third company made a higher bid for a type of meter not called for in the specifications. In a letter attached to its bid Rhodes said, \u201cReferring to Article 12, \u2018 Specifications, \u2019 the last sentence reads: \u2018If the Contractor is delayed by fire or other casualty for which the Contractor is not responsible or by general strikes or lock-outs caused by acts of employees, the contractor shall be allowed such extension of time as the Traffic and Parking Commission shall determine to be just.\u2019 We assume that the word \u2018casualty,\u2019 used in this sense, means any cause beyond the control of the contractor.\u201d At a meter demonstration held before the commission, Manning contended that this letter caused the bid submitted by Rhodes to vary from the published specifications so that the bid could not be considered by the commission. Rhodes\u2019 representatives at the demonstration said, \u201cYou don\u2019t have to make out a contract with the definition. We didn\u2019t take exception\u201d and Rhodes \u201cwill definitely install the meters as complied with in the specifications.\u201d The commission awarded the contract to Rhodes. We are of opinion that Rhodes\u2019 assumption as to the meaning of a \u201ccasualty\u201d did not make its bid unacceptable, since it is clear that Rhodes intended to conform to the specifications whatever the meaning of casualty. See <em>Nelson </em>v. <em>Hamlin, </em>258 Mass. 331, 340. This is supported by the statements of Rhodes\u2019 representatives to the effect that the definition of \u201ccasualty\u201d was not an essential element of Rhodes\u2019 bid.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-4\">Further, Rhodes\u2019 definition of \u201ccasualty\u201d is, at most, a minor variation from the published specifications. A contractor is responsible for the acts of his employees and subcontractors. Consequently it is difficult to imagine a cause of delay beyond the control of the contractor \u201cfor which the contractor is not responsible\u201d which is not a \u201ccasualty.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b65-5\">Even if there were significant differences in the definitions of \u201ccasualty,\u201d the effect, if any, on the obligations of Rhodes would be minimal. A \u201ccasualty\u201d is grounds for requesting an extension of time for performance, but such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>an extension is entirely within the discretion of the commission under art. 12 of the invitation to bid.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-5\">A writ of certiorari will not issue for errors \u201cwhich have not resulted in manifest injustice to the petitioner or which have not adversely affected the real interests of the general public.\u201d <em>Whitney </em>v. <em>Judge of the Dist. Court of No. Berkshire, </em>271 Mass. 448, 459. <em>Chick\u2019s Constr. Co. Inc. </em>v. <em>Wachusett Regional High Sch. Dist. School Comm. </em>343 Mass. 38, 41. \"While it is true that the commission could have rejected all the bids (St. 1909, c. 486, \u00a7 30, as amended) it was not required to do so just because the Rhodes\u2019 bid included a minor variation from the published specifications. We do not believe that the acceptance of the Rhodes\u2019 bid resulted in a manifest injustice to Manning, nor do we believe that it adversely affected the interests of the public. See <em>John D. Ahern Co. Inc. </em>v. <em>Acton-Boxborough Regional Sch. Dist. </em>340 Mass. 355, 358; <em>DiMinico &amp; Cincotta, Inc. </em>v. <em>Fire Commr. of Boston, </em>346 Mass. 766.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-6\">\n<em>Order affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
