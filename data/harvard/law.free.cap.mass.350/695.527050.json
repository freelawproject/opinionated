L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14, for review of two decisions of the State Racing Commission (commission). One dismissed the application of Berkshire Downs, Inc. (Berkshire) for a twenty-four day running horse racing meeting for the year 1966, and the other granted the applications of Eastern Racing Association, Inc. (Eastern) for two such meetings, for a total of ninety racing days. Eastern filed a notice of intervention. A judge of the Superior Court reported the case without decision under Gr. L. c. 214, \u00a7 31, \u201cupon the Petition for Review, the Notice of Intervention, the return of the Respondent and the Stipulation as to agreed facts.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b736-4\">On January 20, 1953, the selectmen of the town of Hancock approved the location of a race track in that town. This approval was \u201cratified and confirmed\u201d by a majority of the voters of the town voting at the next annual election held on February 2,1953. A record of these votes was attached to the application for a license \u201cfiled by Hancock Raceway, Inc. [Hancock] in the year of 1959 which application was dismissed by the Commission.\u201d The selectmen again approved the location of the race track on January 23, 1959, and this approval was \u201cratified and confirmed\u201d by the voters at the annual town election held on February 2, 1959. A record of these votes was attached to the application for a license filed by Hancock in 1960. The commission issued licenses for racing meetings to be held at this location for the years 1960 through 1965.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-5\">On January 4,1966, Eastern filed applications for licenses to conduct two running horse racing meetings totaling ninety days at its track in Revere and East Boston known as Suffolk Downs. That same day Berkshire filed an application for a license to conduct a twenty-four day running horse racing meeting at the track in Hancock.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On January 17,1966, the selectmen of Hancock again approved the location of the track. At the hearing on Eastern\u2019s appli<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"697\">*697</page-number>cation Berkshire was allowed to intervene and at the hearing on Berkshire\u2019s application Eastern was allowed to intervene. After the hearings the commission reached the following \u201cconclusions.\u201d \u201c1. The physical facilities offered by Eastern to the public are far superior to the facilities available at Berkshire .... 2. Eastern offers a better quality of racing .... 3. Eastern is more conveniently located and available to a larger number of people .... 4. The past history of the operation of Berkshire and Eastern indicates that Eastern will draw a much larger daily attendance resulting in increased pari-mutuel handle with a resultant increase in revenue to the Commonwealth. 5. The losses as shown on the Financial Statement of Berkshire for the years of 1964 and 1965 indicate that the Berkshire track lacks public acceptance. 6. The application of Berkshire Downs, Inc. is not in proper form in that it does not comply with the provisions of Section 13-A of Chapter 128A of the General Laws.\u201d On January 27 the commission dismissed Berkshire\u2019s application in its entirety, and the following day the commission granted Eastern\u2019s applications in their entirety.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-5\">The approval of the track location by the selectmen of Hancock was ratified by a vote of the majority of the registered voters of the town voting at the annual election held on February 7, 1966.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-6\">Under G. L. c. 128A, \u00a7 2, \u201cAny person desiring to hold or conduct a horse or dog racing meeting within the commonwealth shall make an application to the state racing commission . . . for a license so to do. . . . Such application . . . shall be filed with the commission on or before the fifth day of January of the calendar year for which such application requests a license to he issued under this chapter; and the commission shall grant or dismiss such application not later than the thirtieth day of January thereafter.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b737-7\">There are two issues presented in this case. The first is whether the application of Berkshire failed to comply with G. L. c. 128A, \u00a7 13A, because the approval by the selectmen of the location of the track was not ratified by the town un<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"698\">*698</page-number>til after the date for granting or dismissing the application had passed. The second issue is whether the remaining findings and conclusions of the commission supported its decisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-4\">Regarding the first issue, G. L. c. 128A, \u00a7 13A, reads in pertinent part: \u201c [N] o license shall he granted by the commission for a racing meeting in any city or town . . . unless the location of the race track where such meeting is to be held or conducted has been once approved by the mayor and aldermen or the selectmen .... Provided, nevertheless, that in the case of towns said approval by the selectmen . . . shall not become effective unless and until it shall be ratified and confirmed by vote, taken by Australian ballot, of a majority of the registered voters of said town voting at the next annual election. . . . Said approval by the selectmen of the location of a race track . . . shall be effective for a period of six years at the expiration of which time the location shall again be so approved before the commission shall grant a license for a racing meeting in said town.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b738-5\">Berkshire contends that \u201cc. 128A, \u00a7 13A does not require ratification of the selectmen\u2019s approval prior to the commission\u2019s granting a license. Section 13A provides that \u2018said <em>approval ~by the selectmen . </em>. . shall be effective for a period of six years at the expiration of which time the location shall again be <em>so approved, </em>before the commission shall grant a license . . ..\u2019 It does not say that the location shall again be \u2018so approved and ratified\u2019 prior to the grant.\u201d Berkshire also argues that ratification relates back to the act ratified.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-6\">The words \u201cso approved\u201d refer to an approval by the selectmen which is effective for six years, but the statute provides that \u201csaid approval by the selectmen . . . shall not become effective <em>unless and until </em>it shall be ratified and confirmed ...\u201d (emphasis supplied). To give effect to the selectmen\u2019s approval prior to its ratification at the next annual election would be contrary to the express language of the statute. As we said in <em>Selectmen of Topsfield </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"699\">*699</page-number><em>State Racing Commn. </em>324 Mass. 309, 313, \u201cThe dominant purpose of the statute was to give the registered voters in towns the right to say whether the approval of the selectmen should be ratified or rejected.\u201d We do not think the statute contemplates the granting of a license before the registered voters of a town have had the opportunity to exercise that right.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-4\">Berkshire also contends that c. 128A, \u00a7 13A, \u201cdoes not require that such ratification occur prior to the granting or dismissal of the application.\u201d It points to the application form prescribed by the commission which states on its first page: \u201cNotice to Applicant: The allotment of racing dates does not constitute the issuance of a license. The Commission may impose such conditions in the allotment of dates as it may see fit, to be fulfilled before the license certificate will be issued.\u201d Berkshire argues that a license is \u201cgranted\u201d when it is issued and not when the application for a license is granted, and therefore \u00a7 13A does not apply to the allotment of racing dates. Berkshire claims that under the provisions of \u00a7 2 the commission has authority to allot dates subject to the condition that the applicant obtain the approval of the selectmen and the ratification and confirmation by the voters of such approval prior to the actual issuance of the license.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-5\">We are unable to agree with this contention. Approval and ratification are not conditions which \u201c [t]he Commission may impose.\u201d These are statutory requirements under \u00a7 13A, and \u201cno license shall be granted\u201d unless and until these requirements are met. \u201cGrant\u201d is defined in part as \u201cto agree or assent to; to allow to be fulfilled; to accord\u201d (Webster\u2019s New International Dictionary [2d ed.]); \u201cto consent to carry out for a person: allow, accord\u201d (Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary).</p>\n<p id=\"b739-6\">We believe that, even by this definition, a license is \u201cgranted\u201d when the commission votes favorably on the application. In that event, the remaining action of the commission is the formal issuance of the license. We are of opinion that approval and ratification are required be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"700\">*700</page-number>fore the commission has authority to act on the application.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-5\">It appears to us that the construction of the statute for which Berkshire contends would result in giving the word \u201cgrant\u201d different meanings in different sections of the same statute. It contends that the \u201cgrant of application\u201d under \u00a7 2 is not to be equated with a \u201cgrant of license\u201d under \u00a7 13A. Berkshire appears to argue that with reference to the granting of the license, the word \u201cgrant\u201d means the formal issuance of a license, yet Berkshire does not argue that the word \u201cgrant\u201d in \u00a7 2 has anything to do with the issuance of a license. \u201cIt is a general rule of statutory construction that ordinarily a term appearing in different portions of a statute is to be given the same meaning.\u201d <em>Arnold </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Corps. &amp; Taxn. </em>327 Mass. 694, 700.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-6\">Furthermore, if we followed Berkshire\u2019s interpretation, the commission would be required to pass on applications which were filed even prior to the approval by the selectmen. We assume that in such an event Berkshire would argue that the commission could pass on the application subject to the condition that the selectmen would subsequently approve the site of the track meeting, and, of course, also subject to the subsequent ratification by the voters of the town.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-7\">The explicit provision in \u00a7 2 fixing a time within which the commission must act on the application reveals to us the intention of the Legislature that there should be a final decision by that date. It is true that \u00a7 9 gives the commission authority to make rules, regulations and conditions, and \u00a7 11 gives the commission authority to \u201csuspend or revoke\u201d a license. There is, however, nothing unusual in such statutory provisions. Quite obviously, such provisions are often necessary to maintain orderly procedure and to adjust to unusual conditions which are not ordinarily foreseeable when legislation is enacted. We are satisfied that the \u201cconditions\u201d referred to in \u00a7 9 are \u201cconditions\u201d \u201cunder which . . . horse . . . racing meetings shall be conducted\u201d and are not to be confused with statutory con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"701\">*701</page-number>ditions which must he complied with precedent to the commission\u2019s authority to act. We believe that to reach the result suggested by Berkshire\u2019s interpretation would frustrate the very purpose of \u00a7 <em>2. </em>It would, we think, militate against providing for a final decision on the awarding or withholding of dates by January 30.\"</p>\n<p id=\"b741-4\">We notej\" too, our decision in <em>Selectmen of Topsfield </em>v. <em>State Racing Commn. </em>324 Mass. 309. In that case, the selectmen of Topsfield had approved the location of a track in 1947. In May of 1948, St. 1948, c. 437, was passed amending G. L. c. 128A, \u00a7 13A, to require ratification of the approval of the selectmen at the next annual election. In January of 1949 an application for a license was filed. On January 25, 1949, a petition for a writ of mandamus was brought to restrain the commission from taking action on the application. The question of ratification did not appear on the ballot at the first annual election following the enactment of the amendment to the statute. The issue presented was whether St. 1948, c. 437, applied so as to require ratification of an approval which was obtained prior to its enactment. We said (p. 312) that <em>if St. 1948, </em>c. 437, <em>\u201cis applicable </em>to the . . . application for a license now pending before the commission . . . <em>the commission is without authority to pass upon the application\u201d </em>(emphasis supplied). Although that case is distinguishable on its facts, it at least suggests that ratification is required before the commission can take any action.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-5\">Additional support for our view that the statute requires approval and ratification prior to the grant of a license by the commission is found in the very practice of Berkshire\u2019s predecessor, Hancock. In submitting its application for a license in 1959 it included records of the approval and ratification of 1953; and in submitting its application for 1960, it included records of the approval and ratification of 1959.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-6\">Although, as shown above, it is clear to us that approval of the selectmen and ratification by the voters are statutory conditions precedent to any action that may be taken by the commission on the application, there is no doubt that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"702\">*702</page-number>provisions of the statute are somewhat confusing. This is primarily because ratification of the selectmen\u2019s approval must take place \u201cat the next annual election,\u201d which, under Gr. L. c. 39, \u00a7 9, \u201cshall be held in February, March or April.\u201d The racing season is from April 1 to November 30. Gr. L. c. 128A, \u00a7 3 (d). Thus, a racing season would elapse between the date a track location is approved and ratified and the date the application for a license may be granted. This makes it difficult to interpret the last sentence of \u00a7 13A, which provides that an approval which is effective (i.e. ratified) \u2018 \u2018 shall be effective for a period of six years at the expiration of which time the location shall again be so approved before the commission shall grant a license.\u201d If a new approval and ratification cannot be obtained until the old one expires and a racing meeting may not be held unless there is an approval which is effective on the date of the meeting, an applicant would be forced to forego racing every sixth year. It is inconceivable that the Legislature intended an intermission of one year every six years. Certainly, such a result is not \u201cclearly required\u201d by the language. See <em>Curran, petitioner, </em>314 Mass. 91, 95. If a new approval and ratification may be obtained prior to the expiration of the old one, and an effective approval on the date of the racing meeting is required', an applicant would be forced to obtain approval and ratification every five years. It is evident to us that the intent of the Legislature was to require a new approval to be obtained every six years, since an approval was to \u201cbe effective for a period of six years.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b742-5\">On the other hand, it may be argued that if an approval and a ratification are required at the expiration of every six years from the date of ratification, then it is possible that a racing meeting would be held in the very year in which the voters of the town refused to ratify the approval of the selectmen. However, we see nothing in the statute to bar such a result, nor do we think it unreasonable or even unusual. Six years earlier the voters agreed to permit racing for a period of six years. The refusal to ratify the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"703\">*703</page-number>subsequent approval simply means that the voters do not want to approve racing for the following six years and does not affect the previous ratification. In this connection, it may be of significance that in the case of <em>North Shore Corp. </em>v. <em>Selectmen of Topsfield, </em>322 Mass. 413, we held that an approval could not be rescinded.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-5\">If the commission acts favorably on an application for the sixth year covered by the approval and ratification, there is no statutory provision preventing the commission from performing the formal act of issuing the license certificate for that year subsequent to the date of the expiration of the ratification. This interpretation, it seems to us, was adopted by Hancock when it obtained a new approval and ratification in 1959, six years after the previous approval in 1953 expired. It was also adopted by the commission in granting a license to Berkshire to conduct races in 1965 although the approval and ratification were in 1959. We are satisfied that this construction affords a workable and practicable means of making the statute \u201can effectual piece of legislation.\u201d See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Slome, </em>321 Mass. 713, 716; <em>Sun Oil Co. </em>v. <em>Director of the Div. on the Necessaries of Life, </em>340 Mass. 235, 238.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-6\">In view of our determination that ratification by the voters of the town was required before the commission could act on Berkshire\u2019s application, the second issue has become moot. A decree is to be entered affirming the decisions of the State Racing Commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b736-6\"> General Laws e. 128A, \u00a7 3 (f), provides: \u201cNo licenses shall he issued for more than an aggregate of ninety racing days in any one year at all running horse race meetings combined. <em>\u2019 \u2019</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b743-8\">Cutter, J.</author>\n<p id=\"aip-dedup-0\">(concurring) I concur in the result on the authority of what was said in <em>Selectmen of Topsfield </em>v. <em>State Racing Commn. </em>324 Mass. 309, 312.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
