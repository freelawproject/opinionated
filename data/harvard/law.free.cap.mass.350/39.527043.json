L. c. 231A that the provisions of G. L. c. 151, \u00a7 1A, prior to its amendment by St. 1965, c. 416, do not apply to the plaintiffs\u2019 parking lot employees. The case was heard upon a statement of agreed facts. The judge entered a decree declaring: \u201c1. That Section 1A of Chapter 151 of the General Laws applies to the . . . [plaintiffs\u2019] parking lot employees. 2. That said employees are required to be paid compensation at a rate not less than one and one-half times the regular rate for all hours worked in excess of forty in a work week.\u201d The plaintiffs appealed from this decree.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-14\">The plaintiffs operate indoor, underground, deck and outdoor parking facilities in the Greater Boston area. Their employees\u2019 duties consist of \u201cthe sale to drivers of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>automobiles of tickets permitting the parking of said automobiles in the lots, and directing the drivers to the spaces allotted. In certain lots these employees are required to drive the cars and to park them. . . . Some of the lots are open twenty-four . . . hours a day, seven days a week; other lots are open for shorter periods of time, ranging from ten hours to twenty-four hours per day. . . . There are occasions when the need arises to assign attendants from open air parking facilities to inclosed parking facilities, and vice versa. The same problems of selling tickets, driving and parking vehicles and scheduling help and keeping of records apply to the indoor parking as to the outdoor parking of cars.\u201d The employees do not do any mechanical work \u201cwith the exception of infrequent occasions when it is necessary to change a flat tire or make a minor motor adjustment or provide supplementary battery power to a stalled car in order that the vehicle can be moved out of the parking area.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b80-4\">The provisions of G. L. c. 151, \u00a7 1A, prior to its amendment by St. 1965, c. 416, pertinent to this controversy read: \u201cExcept as otherwise provided in this section, no employer in the commonwealth shall employ any of his employees in an occupation, as defined in section two, for a work week longer than forty hours, unless such employee receives compensation for his employment in excess of forty hours at a rate not less than one and one half times the regular rate at which he is employed. . . . This section shall not be applicable to any employee who is employed: \u2014. . . (15) as a garageman.\u201d Statute 1965, c. 416, changed cl. (15) to read, \u201c(15) as a garageman, which term shall not include a parking lot attendant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b80-5\">The word \u201cgarageman\u201d has not been defined by this court and no statute defining it has been called to our attention. It is defined as, \u201cA worker in a garage,\u201d by Webster\u2019s New International Dictionary (2d ed. 1956). The term \u201cgarage\u201d is defined differently for different purposes under our statutes. \u201cGarage\u201d includes parking lots for purposes of statutes giving liens on stored cars. G. L. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>c. 255, \u00a7\u00a7 25, 39A, and for requirements of record keeping. Gr. L. c. 90, \u00a7\u00a7 1, 32.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-4\">On the other hand, under the statute covering health regulations we find the phrase \u201cfactory, workshop or <em>garage\u201d </em>(see G-. L. c. 149, \u00a7 117) and the phrase <em>\u201cpublic garages\u201d </em>(see Gr. L. c. 149, \u00a7 133), obviously in each instance referring to an enclosed building (emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b81-5\">Because we are aware of the conflict in the use of the term \u201cgarage\u201d in our statutes we give thought to the meaning of the word as it is commonly understood.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-6\">Webster\u2019s New International Dictionary (2d ed. 1956) defines \u201cgarage\u201d as \u201ca <em>building </em>for housing automotive vehicles; also, a repair shop for such vehicles\u201d (emphasis supplied). The one certain meaning of the word garage \u2019 \u2019 in the aforementioned definition is that it must be a \u201cbuilding.\u201d Common usage, however, enables us to readily distinguish a \u201cparking lot attendant\u201d from a \u201cgarageman.\u201d If the issue in this case solely involved outdoor parking lot attendants and not those employed in a building there would be no difficulty in reaching a determination that such attendants are not \u201cgaragemen\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 1A. In the instant case, there does not appear to be any reason for differentiating between \u201cattendants\u201d at outdoor parking lots and attendants in a building whose \u201croutine of work is the same.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b81-7\">The plaintiffs contend that the exceptions<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> enumerated in \u00a7 1A reveal \u201cthe intention of the legislature to exclude employees in businesses which . . . could not operate on an overtime pay basis because . . . [they] must be open during a large number of hours each day or each week but cannot charge . . . [their] customers a higher price for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>services rendered during the extra, long hours beyond the usual 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. day,\u201d and a parking lot is such a business. However, there are other reasons which might equally well explain the intention of the Legislature. The difficulty of keeping regular employment records of time worked might account for certain exceptions, such as those for seamen, fishermen, child actors, and \u201coutside salesman or outside buyer.\u201d Other exceptions, such as workers in hotels, restaurants, gasoline stations and hospitals, are for jobs that may require continuous service by a particular person beyond the confines of an eight hour schedule. The legislative intent does not appear to us to be related to the price charged the customers for the services rendered.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-5\">Each of the parties refers to the 1965 amendment which specifically states that \u201cgarageman\u201d does not include a parking lot attendant. The plaintiffs contend that the amendment indicates a change from the previous meaning. However, the amendment was enacted soon after the present controversy arose, so it is just as logical to regard it as a clarification of an ambiguity and a legislative interpretation of the original act. See <em>Scaccia </em>v. <em>Boston Elev. Ry. </em>317 Mass. 245, 251. See also <em>Rural Independent Sch. Dist. </em>v. <em>New Independent Sch. Dist. </em>120 Iowa, 119, 125; <em>People ex rel. Westchester Fire Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Davenport, </em>91 N. Y. 574, 591-592. We agree with the judge below that \u201cgarage-man\u201d does not include a parking lot attendant, and therefore G. L. c. 151, \u00a7 1A, applies to the plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-6\">\n<em>Decree affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b81-8\"> Included among the exceptions to \u00a7 1A are employees who are employed \u201c(1) as a janitor or caretaker of residential property ....
