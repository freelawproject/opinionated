The plaintiffs appeal from an interlocutory decree sustaining the defendants\u2019 demurrers to their amended substitute bill \u201cwithout leave to move to amend\u201d and from a final decree dismissing the bill.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-12\">The material allegations of the bill are as follows. Lloyd \u201cis, and during the dates and times referred to herein, was, mentally weak and physically incapacitated\u201d and \u201cfor many years has been hard of hearing.\u201d In June, 1963, she sought \u201clegal advice and assistance in the drawing and execution of a will\u201d from the defendant Mr. Bradley P. Howes, an attorney. Mr. Howes \u201cdid advise and direct\u201d her to execute an inter vivas trust, a copy of which was annexed to the bill. Mr. Howes should have known that she was \u201cmentally weak and physically ill,\u201d yet he \u201cimposed his will upon hers and influenced her unduly to execute a document that she did not comprehend, and that was not in conformity with her wishes and desires.\u201d Under the terms of the trust a life estate is reserved in Lloyd with a remainder for life given to the defendant Clara Fay Davies. On the death of Davies, all accumulated income <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>and the principal with the exception of $2,000 is to he distributed to such charities \u201cas the trustee may in his absolute discretion determine.\u201d Mr. Howes was to become the trustee under the provisions of the trust if a conservator was appointed for Lloyd. The trustee has the power to determine how much of the principal shall be paid to Lloyd or for her support in the event of her incapacity.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-5\">The defendants each demurred to the bill on the grounds \u201cThat the plaintiff has not stated . . . such a cause as entitles her to any relief in equity against this defendant,\u201d and \u201cThat the Bill does not set forth facts sufficient to warrant relief to the plaintiff.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b61-6\">We think that allegations that Lloyd was \u201cmentally weak,\u201d that Mr. Howes \u201cimposed his will upon hers,\u201d \u201cinfluenced her unduly to execute a document that she did not comprehend,\u201d \u201cnot in conformity with her wishes and desires\u201d are but generalizations and conclusions which do not sufficiently inform the defendants of the facts so that they might know what they would be called upon to meet. <em>Boyajian </em>v. <em>Hart, </em>292 Mass. 447, 451. <em>Weinstein </em>v. <em>Chief of Police of Fall River, </em>344 Mass. 314, 317. <em>Mahoney </em>v. <em>Houghton &amp; Richards, Inc. </em>347 Mass. 764. <em>Vogelaar </em>v. <em>H. L. Robbins &amp; Co. Inc. </em>348 Mass. 787.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-7\">The allegation that the attorney advised her to execute a revocable trust in which he might become the trustee in the event of her incapacity does not show undue influence. See <em>Barnum </em>v. <em>Fay, </em>320 Mass. 177. The demurrers were properly sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-8\">The refusal to grant leave to move to amend was within the discretion of the trial judge. <em>Fryefield </em>v. <em>Boston Diaper Serv. Inc. </em>338 Mass. 401, 404. <em>Wilson </em>v. <em>Jennings, </em>344 Mass. 608, 614.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-9\">\n<em>Interlocutory decree affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b61-10\">\n<em>Fmal decree affirmed with costs of appeal to the defendants.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
