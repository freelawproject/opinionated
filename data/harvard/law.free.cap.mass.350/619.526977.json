L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14, by T. J. Hartnett Beverage Company, Inc. (Hartnett), a package store licensee in Cambridge, against the Alcoholic Beverages Control Commission (ABC). Hartnett was charged by the Cambridge licensing commission with having sold bottles of liquor on December 22,1964, at prices below those stated on its current posted price list in violation of G. L. c. 138, \u00a7 15. After a hearing, the Cambridge commission found that Hartnett had violated the statute and suspended its license for six days.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-8\">Hartnett appealed to the ABC under \u00a7 67 and the decision of the Cambridge commission was affirmed. Thereafter Hartnett brought this petition for review in the Superior Court. The ABC\u2019s finding that Hartnett had sold liquor below the prices stated in its price list was not challenged. Hartnett\u2019s sole contention both in the Superior Court and here is that the provisions of \u00a7 15 which relate to the price list requirement were repealed by implication by c. 138, \u00a7 25C, inserted by St. 1952, c. 385, and c. 567, \u00a7 1. See c. 30A, \u00a7 14 (8) (e). The judge below ruled in accordance with this contention and a decree was entered annulling the decisions of both the Cambridge commission and the ABC. The ABC appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-9\">The pertinent provisions of \u00a7 15 are: \u201cEvery licensee hereunder shall keep conspicuously posted in each room where any alcoholic beverages are sold a price list of such beverages .... Sales by such licensees shall be made only ... at the prices stated on the current posted price list.\u201d Section 15 contained the posting provision when <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"621\">*621</page-number>originally enacted. St. 1933, c. 376, \u00a7 2. The requirement that sales must be made at the prices stated in the posted list was added by St. 1935, c. 440, \u00a7 12. Section 25C, which was added in 1952, sets up a procedure for the establishment by the ABO of minimum resale consumer prices for branded alcoholic beverages. (For a summary of \u00a7 250, see <em>Kneeland </em>Liquor, <em>Inc. </em>v. <em>Alcoholic Beverages Control Commn. </em>345 Mass. 228, 230-231.) Subparagraph (f) reads in part: \u201cNo licensee authorized to sell alcoholic beverages at retail for off-premises consumption shall sell, . . . solicit an order for, or advertise, any alcoholic beverages at a price less than the minimum consumer resale price then in effect.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b661-5\">In support of its contention that the above quoted portions of <em>% </em>15 were impliedly repealed by \u00a7 25C, Hartnett relies heavily on the case of <em>Bond Liquor Store, Inc. </em>v. <em>Alcoholic Beverages Control Commn. </em>336 Mass. 70. It is apparent that the judge below considered this decision as controlling. In the <em>Bond </em>case we held that \u00a7 250 impliedly repealed \u00a7 23A. Section 23A required the ABO to suspend a license or permit for stated periods whenever it found a violation of any of the provisions of either the Fair Trade Law or the Unfair Sales Act. Both of these acts are found in Gi. L. c. 93, \u00a7\u00a7 14A-14K. The reasoning in the <em>Bond </em>case was that both statutes were designed to eliminate price cutting and \u201closs-leader selling,\u201d and that if both statutes were operative there would be inconsistencies which would have unreasonable and capricious consequences. Thus it was held that \u00a7 25C, which was enacted after \u00a7 23A, was intended to cover the whole subject of price cutting and repealed \u00a7 23A by necessary implication.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-6\">Section 15, unlike \u00a7\u00a7 23A and 250, is not a price fixing statute. Prior to the enactment of \u00a7\u00a7 23A and 250, a package store licensee could sell alcoholic beverages at such prices as he saw fit. Ail that \u00a7 15 required him to do was to post his price list conspicuously and to sell only at the posted prices. See H. <em>Hollander Co. Inc. </em>v. <em>Alcoholic Beverages Control Commn. </em>327 Mass. 390. The object of the price requirement in \u00a7 15 is to ensure that in a given store <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"622\">*622</page-number>there will be no discrimination between customers with respect to prices. Section 25C sets up a procedure for establishing <em>minimum </em>consumer resale prices. Once those prices have been established the licensee is forbidden by \u00a7 25C (f) to sell below them. Neither \u00a7 25C nor \u00a7 15 undertakes to forbid sales in excess of the established minimum prices. Thus, unlike the situation in the <em>Bond </em>case, we do not have here two statutes which are attempting to cover the same subject matter. The repugnancy which existed between the statutes involved in that case does not exist here.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-5\">We hold, therefore, that the provisions of \u00a7 15 under consideration were not impliedly repealed by <em>% </em>25 C. Repeals by implication have never been favored by our law. \u201cUnless the prior statute is so repugnant to and inconsistent with the later enactment that both cannot stand, then the former is not deemed to have been repealed.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bloomberg, </em>302 Mass. 349, 352, and cases cited. Compare <em>Homer </em>v. <em>Fall River, </em>326 Mass. 673.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-6\">The final decree is reversed and a new decree is to be entered affirming the decision of the ABC with costs of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
