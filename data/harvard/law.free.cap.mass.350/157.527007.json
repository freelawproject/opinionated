Their cancellation presents the question of the validity of a provision that \u201cIn the event of cancellation of this agreement . . . the owner agrees to pay 33%% of the contract price, as liquidated damages.\u201d The trial judge held that the provision was unreasonable and void as a penalty. He found for the plaintiff in the amount of $1, and reported the correctness of his finding to the Appellate Division, which dismissed the report. The plaintiff appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-15\">The case was submitted on agreed facts. The contract was signed the evening of March 25,1964. The defendants <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>made a deposit of $1 and agreed to pay the balance in \u201ccash Sept. 15th.\u201d About nine o\u2019clock on the morning following the signing of the contract the defendants can-celled \u201cbefore the plaintiff did anything in respect to the work it was to perform.\u201d <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> \u201cNo evidence was agreed upon or offered as to the actual damage suffered by the plaintiff.\u201d There was no error. The case is governed in all respects by <em>A-Z Servicenter, Inc. </em>v. <em>Segall, </em>334 Mass. 672. For aught that appears, the damages in event of breach were not going to be difficult of ascertainment. See Restatement: Contracts, \u00a7 339; Williston, Contracts (3d ed.) \u00a7 776; Corbin, Contracts, \u00a7 1060, p. 350; 25 C. J. S., Damages, \u00a7 107, pp. 1048-1050. Time was lacking for an opportunity for the plaintiff to incur much expense of performance. The stipulated sum is unreasonably and grossly disproportionate to the real damages from the breach. In these circumstances, the aggrieved party will be awarded no more than his actual damage. <em>Makletzova </em>v. <em>Diaghileff, </em>227 Mass. 100, 108. <em>A-Z Servicenter, Inc. </em>v. <em>Segall, supra, </em>675.
