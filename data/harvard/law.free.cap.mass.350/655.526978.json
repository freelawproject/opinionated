L. c. 185, \u00a7 1 (ji/2), and c. 240, \u00a7 14A (inserted, respectively, by St. 1934, c. 263, \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 2), to obtain a declaration that Hamilton\u2019s zoning by-law was unconstitutionally vague as it applied to Beechwood\u2019s land (the locus) east of Main Street (apparently sometimes called Bay Road) near its junction with Rock Maple Avenue. The by-law incorporated by reference a zoning map, but neither the by-law nor the map set out the zone boundaries by courses or distances except as these could be determined from the map.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"656\">*656</page-number>The boundary between a residence A district (with a minimum lot area of 20,000 square feet) and a residence B district (with a minimum lot area of 40,000 square feet), as shown on the map, runs east a few hundred feet from Main Street, then south a short distance, then east again to Miles River. Beechwood filed with the town planning board a preliminary subdivision plan of the locus upon the assumption that the locus is in the A district. After investigation, the town engineer reported to the planning board that the locus, except for a small triangular piece of the southwest corner, is in the B district.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-5\">The zone \u201cboundary lines in great part run through open areas or wooded land.\u201d The locus is a wooded area of approximately seventeen acres. The surrounding area is wooded and swampy. The town is a \u201cgeneral rural community with few real estate developments,\u201d although one of these, established in 1952 before the zoning by-law was passed (1954), adjoins the locus at or near the zone boundary east of Main Street. Indeed, one exhibit strongly suggests that the zone boundary may have been set in 1954 so as to include the 1952 development (but not most of the locus) in the A zone, for the zone boundary line near Main Street is shown on the exhibit as following the northerly boundary and the north part of the easterly boundary of the 1952 development. Because of the town engineer\u2019s report, the planning board rejected Beechwood\u2019s definitive subdivision plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-6\">The Land Court judge found that \u201cthe division line between\u201d the A district and the B district \u201con the zoning map . . . was shown with sufficient definiteness ... to enable . . . [Beechwood] to determine its location as to . . . [its] land. \u2019 \u2019 He ruled that the zoning by-law and map were valid and \u201cin full effect as to\u201d the locus. He ordered the entry of a decree in accordance with his decision dated June 16, 1965. A \u201cfinal decree\u201d accordingly was entered (on Beechwood\u2019s motion) on July 26, 1965. Beechwood claimed an appeal on August 11, 1965, sixteen days after the date of the so called \u201cfinal decree,\u201d but fifty-six days after the decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"657\">*657</page-number>1. The town contends that Beechwood\u2019s appeal was too late because not claimed within twenty days of the judge\u2019s decision. See G. L. c. 185, \u00a7 15, which provides, in part, \u201cQuestions of law arising in the land court on any decision or decree may be taken by any party aggrieved directly to the supreme judicial court for revision in the same manner in which questions of law are taken to that court from the superior court.\u201d General Laws (Ter. Ed.) c. 231, \u00a7 96, provides for appeals from certain orders in the Superior Court.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> General Laws c. 185, \u00a7 1, lists in par. (j%) petitions under G. L. c. 240, \u00a7 14A, \u201cto determine the validity and extent of municipal zoning . . . by-laws\u201d in the same group with other matters, such as par. (a) land registration, par. (b) proceedings in respect of tax titles, and par. (e) petitions to determine the validity of encumbrances under G. L. c. 240, \u00a7\u00a7 11-14. The two types of litigation last mentioned (although they may seem in some aspects like equitable proceedings) have hitherto been treated as proceedings at law. See <em>Crocker </em>v. <em>Cotting, </em>173 Mass. 68, 69, and <em>American Unitarian Assn. </em>v. <em>Minot, </em>185 Mass. 589, 590 (dealing with R. L. c. 182, \u00a7 11, prior to the transfer by St. 1904, c. 448, \u00a7 1, of jurisdiction under the section to the Land Court). See also <em>Norwood </em>v. <em>Norwood Civic Assn. </em>340 Mass. 518, 522 (tax title foreclosure). It is to be noted that pars, (a) to (j%), inclusive, of c. 185, \u00a7 1, are separately grouped in the statute from proceedings under the Land Court\u2019s equity jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-4\">The present petition is entitled \u201c [b]ill of [c]omplaint\u201d and is phrased in the form of a bill in equity. It expressly states, however, that Beechwood \u201cinvokes the provisions of\u201d G. L. c. 185, \u00a7 1 <em>(jVz), </em>and c. 240, \u00a7 14A, both enacted by St. 1934, c. 263, \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 2 (see 1934 House Bills Nos. 855, 1492), some years prior to St. 1945, c. 582, \u00a7 1, by which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"658\">*658</page-number>G. L. c. 231A came into existence. Although the facts alleged and found, may sufficiently show the existence of a controversy, the petitioner makes no explicit reference to declaratory relief under G. L. c. 231A, and gives no clear or adequate indication that it seeks any relief in equity (as opposed to relief under \u00a7 1 [j%]), declaratory or other-, wise. Beechwood does state that it has no adequate remedy at law.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-4\">We hold that proceedings based solely on c. 185, \u00a7 1 (j%), are on the law side of the Land Court and review of them is to be governed by c. 185, \u00a7 15, and related statutes. In Land Court proceedings, if declaratory or other relief in equity is being Sought (see e.g. <em>Kershaw </em>v. <em>Zecchini, </em>342 Mass. 318), that should be made plain by appropriate pleadings. We take Beechwood at its word in determining the nature of the petition filed by it. In the hope, however, that we may assist in avoiding possible further litigation, we discuss briefly the merits of this case, which has been fully argued. See <em>Wellesley College </em>v. <em>Attorney Gen. </em>313 Mass. 722, 731.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-5\">2. Because the case would be before us on appeal and not by bill of exceptions, our review would be confined to the pleadings and the judge\u2019s decision even if the appeal had been seasonably claimed. See e.g. <em>Cerel </em>v. <em>Framingham, </em>342 Mass. 17, 18; <em>Comeau </em>v. <em>Manzelli, </em>344 Mass. 375, 376. The decision incorporates the exhibits by reference. We need consider only whether the decision is correct in law upon the facts found by the judge. See <em>Harrington </em>v. <em>Anderson, </em>316 Mass. 187,192; <em>Ide </em>v. <em>Bowden, </em>342 Mass. 22, 24. Cf. cases before us upon bills of exceptions, <em>Pitman </em>v. <em>Medford, </em>312 Mass. 618, 619; <em>Aronson </em>v. <em>Sharon, </em>346 Mass. 598.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-6\">A definition of the zone boundary by metes and bounds would have been more satisfactory than merely showing it upon the zoning maps included among the exhibits. See <em>Maki </em>v. <em>Yarmouth, </em>340 Mass. 207, 211. Use of small scale maps, without very precise definition of zone boundaries in the by-law itself, obviously is likely to lead to misunderr <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"659\">*659</page-number>standing and controversy. Examination of the judge\u2019s findings and the exhibits, however, convinces us that the judge was warranted in concluding in effect that the zoning map was sufficiently specific and that, from the map, the location of the zone boundary in relation to fixed points shown on the map (such as the intersection of Main Street and Rock Maple Avenue) could be determined with reasonable accuracy.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-5\">\n<em>Appeal dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b697-5\"> Section 96 reads, in part, \u201cA party aggrieved by any order of the superior court sustaining or overruling a demurrer ... or a party aggrieved by an order for judgment upon a case stated, or by any order decisive of the case founded upon matter of law apparent on the record in any proceeding, may appeal therefrom to the supreme judicial court ....
