The wire rack \u201cin the form of latticework\u201d extended from the window behind the right hand stool and half way to the next stool in a line parallel to the stools. The space between the rack and the right hand stool measured three to four inches. When the plaintiff entered the store all the stools were occupied except the one nearest the window. She observed that the rack came up \u201cin . . . back of the stool\u201d in the same position that she had observed when previously in the store. She \u201csqueezed in between the woman on the second seat from the window <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>and the wire rack. ... In leaving . . . [she] turned to her left . . . [and] put her left foot back in order to get up . . . [and] caught her foot in the . . . rack and fell.\u201d The evidence should have been submitted to the jury. They could have found negligence in the placing of the rack. The plaintiff was invited into a space from which she could not get out except at the risk of engagement with the latticework of the rack. It was not contributory negligence as a matter of law to use this customer space in response to the invitation and to leave it in the way described, regardless of whether the plaintiff had the position of the visible rack in mind, or should have. See <em>Robicheau </em>v. <em>Supreme Mkts. Inc. </em>333 Mass. 608, 609-610. To the extent that <em>O\u2019Neil </em>v. <em>W. T. Grant Co. </em>335 Mass. 234, 235, states a different rule we decline to follow it.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-4\">\n<em>Exceptions sustained.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
