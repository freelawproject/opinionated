L. c. 63, \u00a7 67 (as amended through St. 1956, c. 550, \u00a7 12).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The excise was required <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"649\">*649</page-number>to be measured by the appellant\u2019s \u201cinterest\u201d in the M.Y. \u201cShinnecock\u201d (the vessel). The board based its findings and opinion on the pleadings, the stipulation of certain facts, and some documentary evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-5\">The appellant is a Massachusetts corporation subject to the business corporation excise (Gr. L. c. 63, \u00a7 30, as amended through St. 1956, c. 550, \u00a7\u00a7 1-3, and \u00a7 32, as amended through St. 1957, c. 577, \u00a7 1) and to the vessel excise (c. 63, \u00a767). On January 8,1959, the appellant filed its business corporation excise return and its vessel excise return for the taxable year ended October 31, 1958, and paid a vessel excise of $189.73. The appellant included in its vessel-excise return its interest in the vessel at $56,776.13, which was the value of the appellant\u2019s equity in the vessel, viz. the original cost ($366,332.44) less the sum of (a) accumulated depreciation ($187,396.31), and (b) the balance payable upon the mortgage of the vessel ($122,160).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The commissioner, on November 22,1961, assessed the appellant\u2019s 1958 vessel excise at $596.45, which (after deducting $189.73, theretofore paid) left a balance of $406.72. This balance was caused by the commissioner\u2019s determination that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"650\">*650</page-number>value of the appellant\u2019s interest- in the vessel was $178,936, its full depreciated cost as of October 31, 1958. The commissioner thus wholly disregarded the $122,160 mortgage balance. The vessel \u201cwas engaged in interstate or foreign carrying trade or engaged exclusively in fishing and documented . . . under the laws of the United States during the period of its business in the year preceding October 31, 1958.\u201d The fair cash value of the vessel on. that day was $178,936 and the vessel mortgage ($122,160) was then a valid obligation.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-5\">The appellant filed two requests for rulings, each in substance that, for the purpose of the excise imposed by c. 63, \u00a7 67, the balance of any valid mortgage encumbrance upon the vessel as of October 31,1958, must be deducted from the vessel\u2019s fair market value in determining the measure of the excise. The board denied these requests.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-6\">What is now \u00a7 67 has had a long history. See Nichols, Taxation in Massachusetts (3d ed.) 263-264, 642-644, and Pike and Cohen Supp. p. 28. See also <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>195 Mass. 607, 611; <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>324 Mass. 724, 731-732. Statute 1881, c. 284, \u00a7 1, provided that certain vessels would not be taxed as personal estate of the owner, but that \u201cthe net,yearly income of such . . . vessels shall be taxed to the . . . owners ... in their places of residence proportionally to their <em>interests </em>therein\u201d (emphasis supplied). By \u00a7 3, the statute was not to apply to a vessel unless its owner \u201cshall . . . make a return ... to the assessors of every town ... of which the owner of any share or <em>interest </em>in such . . . vessel may be a resident . . . which shall set forth the name of such owner, and the name, class, and tonnage of such . . . vessel . . . the share or interest of such owner therein, and the dividends paid him upon his . . . share or interest . . . and such dividends shall constitute the <em>net yearly income </em>to be taxed to such owner as provided in this act\u201d (emphasis supplied). General Statutes c. 11, \u00a7 4 (1860), had theretofore provided that personal estate \u201cshall, for the purposes of taxation, include . . . vessels.\u201d By the 1881 statute, vessels en<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"651\">*651</page-number>gaged in the foreign carrying trade were instead taxed under that part of .Gren. Sts. c. 11, \u00a7 4, which included in personal estate for the purposes of taxation \u201cso much of the income from a profession, trade, or employment, as exceeds the sum of . . . [$600] a year; but no income shall be taxed which is derived from property subject to taxation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b691-4\">In St. 1881, c. 284, the word \u201cinterest\u201d may refer to a portion of the ownership of the vessel (as for example the property of the owner of a fractional part of the vessel) without regard to the effect of any mortgage encumbrance. The whole statutory arrangement, however, strongly suggests that, as to a mortgaged vessel, the measure of the tax or excise would in effect be an equity measure. It will be observed that the tax was on, or measured by, the <em>net </em>income in the form of \u201cdividends.\u201d These normally would be paid from income remaining after provision for the payment of interest (and perhaps also partial payments of principal) upon the mortgage. Thus, to some degree at least, the measure of the 1881, tax or excise took into account any mortgage and necessarily reflected the equity in the vessel rather than its total market value.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-5\">The provisions of St. 1881, c. 284, were continued without change now significant in Pub. Sts. c. 11, \u2022\u00a7\u00a7 8-10 (1882), and in R L. c. 12, \u00a7\u00a7 7-9 (1902). By St. 1902, c. 374, a new system of taxing vessels in the foreign carrying trade was instituted and St. 1902, c. 375, repealed R. L. c. 12, \u00a7\u00a7 7-9, apparently because the repealed sections had been largely, if not entirely, supplanted by the provisions of c. 374. Chapter 374, \u00a7 1, provided for an excise \u201cupon the interest of every [Massachusetts] corporation\u201d with a place of business in this State, \u201cin any . . . vessel . . . engaged in the foreign carrying trade\u201d of one third of one per cent \u201cupon the value of such interest.\u201d Section 2 required certain returns to be filed and directed the tax commissioner to \u201cdeduct . . '. [the] value\u201d of the corporation\u2019s interest in the vessel \u201cfrom the fair cash value of the [corporation\u2019s] shares . . . as estimated . . . for the purpose of determin<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"652\">*652</page-number>ing the true value of its corporate franchise under\u201d R. L. c. 14. See \u00a7\u00a7 37-42 for the franchise tax on business corporations. Section 3 of St. 1902, c. 374, imposed the excise upon <em>\u201c </em>[p] ersons or partnerships owning an interest in any such . . . vessel,\u201d and \u00a7 4 repealed so much of R. L. c. 12, \u00a7 4, Fourth, as related to a tax on the income of such vessels.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-5\">The net effect of the 1902 statute, so far as now pertinent, was to extend the vessel excise to corporations.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The history of the 1902 statute shows that the excise was to be imposed as a substitute for the inclusion of the value of the vessels in the value of the corporate shares. That value, of course, however determined, would reflect in major degree the burden of any mortgage encumbrance.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b692-6\">Later revisions of the relevant statutes do not appear to have made substantial changes in the statutory pattern, in respects here material, except as the form of corporate excise taxation has changed over the years. See e.g. St. 1909, c. 490, Part III, \u00a7\u00a7 10, 40-43; Report of the Joint Special Committee on Consolidating and Arranging the General Laws (1920), p. 557, note on c. 63, \u00a7 67.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b692-7\">The term \u201cinterest ... in any . . . vessel,\u201d as used in G. L. c. 63, \u00a7 67 (fn. 2), is not free from ambiguity. As suggested earlier, it would be possible to interpret the term restrictively as referring only to the proportionate share of one of several owners of a vessel. The term, however, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"653\">*653</page-number>may fairly be interpreted broadly enough to include also a reference (where a vessel is encumbered by a mortgage) at least to the beneficial equity interest of the mortgagor. The broader interpretation appears to us to be the more reasonable one. The word \u201cinterest\u201d may refer to a variety of forms of ownership. If it had been intended that the measure of the excise with respect to a mortgaged vessel include (as a unit) both the interest of the mortgagor and that of the mortgagee, it would have been more natural to refer in \u00a7 67 to the value of the vessel itself, and to shares in its ownership, rather than to the \u201cvalue of such interest.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"Ay3b\">Some indications of legislative intention are given by the history, already summarized, of the pertinent statutory provisions applicable during 1958, and predecessor statutes. These indications point, we think, to a legislative purpose to measure the excise upon a taxed mortgagor corporation by the value of its equity interest in each vessel subject to the excise. The excise, in its different forms over the years, certainly at all times has been designed to reduce and limit the direct and indirect tax burden upon vessels used in foreign and interstate trade and fishing. It has also been designed to exclude from the \u201ccorporate excess\u201d measure of the excise imposed by c. 63, \u00a7 32, and from the share value measure of its franchise tax predecessors, the value of the .same interest which was to be used as the measure of the excise under \u00a7 67. Under the 1958 form of the statutes, because the mortgage on the vessel would be taken into account as a liability (see fn. 3) in determining the appellant\u2019s \u201ccorporate excess,\u201d only the value, if any, of the equity in the vessel would become a part of the \u201ccorporate excess\u201d measure of the excise imposed by \u00a7 32, prior to the deduction of the value of the interest in the vessel, as then permitted by \u00a7 67. We are of opinion that only this equity value should be deducted from the value of the corporate excess by virtue of the deduction provision of \u00a7 67. See fn. 2, sentence containing the material following point [A]. The word \u201cinterest,\u201d where it is used in \u00a7 67 to describe the measure of the vessel excise, must have the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"654\">*654</page-number>same meaning as when used to define the deduction. This \u201cinterest\u201d we hold to be the value of the equity in the vessel after taking into account valid mortgages.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-5\">The result we reach is consistent with the use of the word \u201cinterest\u201d in other somewhat comparable provisions of the tax statutes. See e.g. Gr. L. c. 59, \u00a7\u00a7 12, 14 (assessment of mortgaged land); c. 65, \u00a7 1, as amended (including certain property \u201cand any interest therein\u201d within the measure of the inheritance tax). See also <em>McCurdy </em>v. <em>McCurdy, </em>197 Mass. 248, 252; <em>Assessors of Boston </em>v. <em>Jakes, </em>341 Mass. 136,138. Cf. G. L. c. 59, \u00a7 19, which expressly provides for local taxation of mortgaged personal property as a unit unless a mortgagee is in possession. Also, any doubt whether more than the appellant\u2019s equity should be included within the measure of the excise must be resolved in favor of the appellant under the usual principle requiring strict construction of taxing statutes. <em>Cabot </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Corps. &amp; Taxn. </em>267 Mass. 338, 340. <em>Squantum Gardens, Inc. </em>v. <em>Assessors of Quincy, </em>335 Mass. 440, 447-448. <em>State Tax Commn. </em>v. <em>Gray, </em>340 Mass. 535, 540.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-6\">The appellant\u2019s requests for rulings should have been given. The sum of $406.72 of the 1958 excise assessment, made in 1961 (i.e. the balance above $189.73 paid in 1959), was not warranted by \u00a7 67. The additional excise must be refunded with interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-7\">The decision of the Appellate Tax Board is reversed. This case and the other cases which by stipulation are to be governed by this case are to be remanded to the board for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. The several appellants are to have costs of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-8\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b688-13\"> Section 67, as amended, reads in part, \u2018 \u2018 The commissioner shall annually assess as of the last day of the taxable year ... an excise tax upon the <em>interest </em>of every [Massachusetts] corporation . . . having a place of business therein, <em>in any . . . vessel </em>which has, during the period of its business in the year preceding such day, been engaged in interstate or foreign carrying trade or engaged exclusively in fishing and documented and carrying \u2018papers\u2019 under the laws of the United States, which tax shall be one third of one per cent upon the <em>value of such interest </em>as determined by him. Such tax shall become due and shall be collected at the same time and in the same manner as other taxes assessed to such corporations. The president and treasurer of every such corporation owning <em>an interest </em>in any such . . . vessel shall, on or before the fifteenth day of the third month following the close of each taxable year, make a return to the commissioner . . . setting forth . . . the name of the . . . vessel, <em>the interest of the Corporation therein, and the value of such interest. </em>If the commissioner is satisfied of the truth of the return he shall deduct said value [A] <em>from the value of its corporate excess as determined by him, if it is taxable under sections thirty to thirty-eight 0, inclusive, or </em>from the value of its corporate franchise, if it is taxable under section fifty-eight ...\u201d (emphasis supplied).
