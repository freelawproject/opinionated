The case was heard in the Appellate Tax Board on an \u201cAgreed Statement of Facts.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b669-12\">On January 1, 1960, and at the time of her death on September 9, 1960, one Ruby Boyer Miller, mother of the appellant William, was the owner of a parcel of real estate in Wenham. As of January 1, 1960, the property was assessed at $331,700. It is conceded that \u201c [t]he fair Cash value . . . was Two Hundred Sixty Thousand Dollars ($260,000).\u201d At the time of her death Mrs. Miller was domiciled in Michigan. Her sole heir and next of Mn was the appellant. Mrs. Miller\u2019s will, in which the appellant was named as executor, was filed for probate in Michigan on September 15,1960. The appellant \u201cwas not a resident of Michigan and under the laws of that State, could not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"630\">*630</page-number>qualify as a fiduciary for a Michigan decedent.\u201d A resident of that State, one Rockwell T. Gust, a Michigan attorney, was appointed special administrator. While in Massachusetts during the month of September, the appellant \u201cbeing named executor as aforesaid, took possession of the real estate\u201d here and \u201ctook such other steps as he deemed advisable to preserve Massachusetts assets and provide for payment of the debts and obligations of the estate.\u201d On September 30, 1960, \u201cpursuant to instructions\u201d from the appellant, \u201ca check was drawn on the estate funds\u201d for real estate taxes due on the property in question, and William <em>\u2018 </em>caused the above-mentioned check to be delivered to the Collector of Taxes for the Town of Wenham.\u201d The check* was deposited for collection by the town and paid. On September 30,1960, William \u201ccaused an application for Abatement of Real Estate Tax ... to be filed with the Board of Assessors.\u201d On October 24, 1960, Mrs. Miller\u2019s will was admitted to probate in Michigan and Mr. Gust was appointed administrator, c.t.a. On November 10, 1960, the appellant \u201cfiled in the Probate Court for Essex County, Massachusetts, a petition for the allowance of a foreign will and his appointment as executor thereunder.\u201d On December 27,1960, the will was admitted to probate in Massachusetts, and the appellant was appointed and qualified as ancillary executor on that date, and still serves as such.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-4\">The Fiduciary Trust Company of Boston was the trustee of a revocable trust established by Mrs. Miller. Under the provisions of that trust, \u201cFrom and after the death of the Settlor, and so long as the Settlor\u2019s son . . . shall live, the Trustee shall pay and distribute the net annual income of the trust estate . . . one-half to . . . [the appellant]; and one-half to and among a class of beneficiaries consisting of . . . [the appellant], his wife and his issue living . . . in such proportions as the Trustee in its discretion shall each year determine.\u201d In addition, Article Sixth of the trust provides in pertinent part as follows: \u201cThe Trustee shall pay to the Settlor\u2019s estate, upon the written request of the Settlor\u2019s executor or administrator: (a) such amount as said executor or administrator may certify to be neces<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"631\">*631</page-number>sary to pay the just debts of the Settlor .... The obligation and discretion of the Trustee to pay to the Settlor\u2019s estate any amount as provided in this paragraph shall not be affected by the fact that the Settlor\u2019s estate shall have the funds with which to pay in whole or in part the said amount.\u201d Upon final settlement of the estate in 1964, the trust reimbursed the estate in full for the property tax which had been paid from the funds of the estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-5\">The assessors maintain that the appellant was without standing to bring an application for abatement. The appellant asserts that he had standing under Gr. L. c. 59, \u00a7 59, which reads in pertinent part as follows: \u201cA person upon whom a tax has been assessed or the administrator of the estate of such a person or the <em>executor or trustee under the will of such a person, </em>if aggrieved by such tax, may . . . on or before October first of the year to which the tax relates . . . apply in writing to the assessors, on a form approved by the commissioner, for an abatement thereof, and . . . upon an assessment of any of his property in excess of its fair cash value, they shall make a reasonable abatement. ... If a person other than the person to whom a tax on real estate is assessed is the <em>owner </em>thereof, or has an <em>interest </em>therein, or is in <em>possession </em>thereof, <em>and pays the tax, </em>he may thereafter prosecute in his own name any application, appeal or action provided by law for the abatement or recovery of such tax, which after the payment thereof shall be deemed for the purposes of such application, appeal or action, to have been assessed to the person so paying the same\u201d (emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b671-6\">It is the appellant\u2019s contention that his later appointment as ancillary executor validated his act in applying for an abatement as an executor designate. The assessors contend that the executor must be appointed prior to the application for abatement. They argue that there is \u201cno method . . . whereby on October 1st of any given year the assessors can distinguish a person who may later become an executor from one who may not,\u201d and \u201c [i]f haste is required to prevent a loss to the estate, temporary administration may be taken out under Gr. L. c. 193.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b672-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"632\">*632</page-number>The statutory provision enabling \u201cthe executor or trustee under the will\u201d to apply for an abatement of the tax was enacted after the Appellate Tax Board had recommended \u201cthat the words \u2018testamentary trustee, administrator or executor\u2019 be inserted so that a testamentary trustee or an administrator or an executor of an estate may make application for abatement in certain eases without first paying the tax.\u201d 1945 House Doc. No. 8, p. 6. The Legislature, however, chose the words \u201c [a] person upon whom a tax has been assessed or the administrator of the estate of such a person or the executor or trustee under the will of such a person.\u201d Grammatically, \u201cunder the will\u201d modifies both \u2018 \u2018 the executor \u2019 \u2019 and the \u2018 \u2018 trustee. \u2019 \u2019 By definition, the \u201cexecutor\u201d of an estate is \u201cunder the will\u201d of the decedent, since he is \u201ca person named in a will to execute its provisions. \u2019 \u2019 Bouvier\u2019s Law Dictionary, Rawle\u2019s Third Rev. It seems to us that it would be redundant to use the phrase \u201cunder the will\u201d in the statute with reference to the word \u201cexecutor,\u201d unless the Legislature intended to include persons named as executors but not yet appointed by the court. The appellant was named executor under the will of his mother, and, therefore, we are of opinion that he had standing to apply for the abatement.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-5\">Although an executor \u201cunder the will\u201d may obtain an abatement of the tax in behalf of the estate, he cannot be reimbursed in the amount of the abatement until he is appointed by the court. General Laws c. 59, \u00a7 69, provides for reimbursement solely to \u201c[a] person whose tax has been abated,\u201d and an executor designate has no rights to money due the estate. In the instant case, however, the appellant was appointed an ancillary executor, and thus was entitled to receive the amount abated.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-6\">In view of our holding, we need not discuss the appellant\u2019s requests for rulings. The decision of the Appellate Tax Board is reversed, and an abatement of the 1960 tax is to be granted in the amount of $3,800.10 with interest and costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
