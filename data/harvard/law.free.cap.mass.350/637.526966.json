The petitioner appealed from a denial of the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-17\">The Boston State Hospital is under the control of the Department of Mental Health. G. L. c. 19, \u00a7 5. Its records are subject to G. L. c. Ill, \u00a7 70. The petitioner relies upon \u00a7 70, as amended by St. 1945, c. 291. That statute in its present form, however, is as amended through St. 1964, c. 653, which contains an exception expressly excluding from inspection by a patient or his attorney the records of \u201ca <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"638\">*638</page-number>hospital or clinic under the control of the department of mental health.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b678-5\">The petitioner contends that St. 1964, c. 653, was enacted in violation of Senate Bule 50,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> but the violation is not conceded. In any event, the statute cannot be thus impugned in a court of law. <em>Field </em>v. <em>Clark, </em>143 U. S. 649, 672. <em>Sears </em>v. <em>Treasurer &amp; Recr.
