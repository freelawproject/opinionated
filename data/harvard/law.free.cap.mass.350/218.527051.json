Before papers were passed the city took the land by eminent domain. This bill in equity seeks to preserve the plaintiff\u2019s rights under the agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-12\">The bill of complaint was entitled \u201cplaintiff\u2019s bill for specific performance. \u2019 \u2019 Among the prayers was one for an injunction against the defendant\u2019s \u201cinterfering with the plaintiff\u2019s interest in said real estate as a party in interest\u201d under Gr. L. c. 79, and another for \u201can assessment of damage suffered by the plaintiff by reason of the failure of the defendant to perform his said agreement and for the value of his interest in the property taken by the city.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b260-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>The parties first entered into a written contract dated May 25,1962, which was mutually rescinded when the plaintiff learned from the title examination that the defendant held a tax title, which would not be acceptable for a mortgage. Under this contract the purchase price was to have been $10,000, payable $5,000 on delivery of the deed and $5,000 in one year.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-4\">Subsequently, the defendant told the plaintiff he would convey to him a Land Court title, and the plaintiff paid him $500 to enable him to begin registration proceedings. The defendant signed a receipt reading, \u201cJuly 30 1962. Received of Joseph Spadea Five Hundred &amp; no/100 Dollars Acc. Sale Land rec. Ply. Co. Deeds Book 1837 Page 192-3. Papers to pass when title registered. Bal. 9500 when deed delivered in cash 4500 \u2014 mtge. 5000 1 year.\u201d The judge rightly ruled that this was a compliance with the Statute of Frauds. The contrary is not now contended.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-5\">On August 23, 1962, a petition was filed in the Land Court. On October 13, 1962, the city council commenced the necessary steps in furtherance of taking the property by eminent domain under Gr. L. c. 79. On October 26,1962, the defendant wrote the plaintiff, \u201c [T]he city has seized my land for a school. ... I am therefore returning you a check in the amount of $500.00 which is the binder you gave me.\u201d On November 2, 1962, the plaintiff sent back the check and refused to release the defendant. On November 13, 1962, the city council voted to take the land. The present bill was filed on November 15, 1962. The actual recording of the taking in the Registry of Deeds was on November 28, 1962. The title had not then been registered.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> A petition by the defendant for damages for the taking is now pending in the Superior Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-6\">The defendant filed a plea in bar setting up that the city council had voted to take the land by eminent domain, that the taking was duly recorded in the Registry of Deeds, and that \u201csuch taking renders specific performance impossible and relieves the respondent from liability for damages.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>The plea in bar was overruled, and the defendant excepted.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b261-5\">The trial judge rightly ruled that in equity compensation for the taking represents the land, citing <em>Cornell-Andrews Smelting Co. </em>v. <em>Boston &amp; Providence R.R. </em>209 Mass. 298, <em>Salvatore </em>v. <em>Fuscellaro, </em>53 R. I. 271, and Restatement: Restitution, \u00a7 125. He also ruled that upon receipt of the damages the defendant will be liable to the plaintiff to the extent of the plaintiff\u2019s equitable interest and, therefore, that the plaintiff will be entitled to the sum to be paid by the city subject to the defendant\u2019s right to receive up to $9,500. This should be modified. See below.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-6\">A final decree was entered that the plaintiff is a party in interest and entitled to join in the petition for the assessment of damages. The defendant appealed. The judge made a report of the material facts found by him herein-before summarized. The evidence is reported.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-7\">The defendant contends that the contract has become impossible of performance because the land cannot be registered (the ground of his plea in bar), and because payment in part by mortgage can no longer be given. Acceptance of this contention would be a triumph of form over substance, and would also ignore G-. L. c. 79, \u00a7\u00a7 27<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and 29. Section 27 provides that where several parties have estates in the same property and one party petitions the Superior Court for damages, the others may become parties to the petition. Section 29 provides for the apportionment of the damages among those entitled. The New York statute<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>cited by the defendant differs substantially and cannot, of course, be given even persuasive effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-5\">The plea in bar was properly overruled. We do not accept the contention as to impossibility of performance. That the bill was originally described as for specific performance is not decisive. \u201c [T]he character of a pleading or other paper filed in a cause is to be determined from its essential substance and not from its descriptive title or name.\u201d <em>Universal Adjustment Corp. </em>v. <em>Midland Bank, Ltd. </em>281 Mass. 303, 328, and cases cited. <em>Beaman-Marvell Co. </em>v. <em>Marvell, </em>305 Mass. 246, 247. <em>Commissioner of Ins. </em>v. <em>Broad St. Mut. Cas. Ins. Co. </em>306 Mass. 362, 364-365.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-6\">The defendant\u2019s brief quotes <em>from Cornell-Andrews Smelting Co. </em>v. <em>Boston &amp; Providence R.R., supra, </em>209 Mass. 298, 307: \u201cWhere land of B on which A has an optioh of buying the fee is taken by the exercise of the paramount power of eminent domain, A can no longer at his election buy the land but he can at his election buy the fund into which in equity the land has been converted by the- exercise of the power of eminent domain.\u201d From this the defendant argues that the plaintiff must elect, but refuses to elect, has never tendered, nor agreed to tender, the balance of the purchase price, and hence is'without remedy under the bill.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-7\">The final decree declares that the plaintiff is a party in interest and is entitled to share the defendant\u2019s right to damages without further payment to the defendant. , Here should be applied the equitable principle that he who seeks equity must do equity. <em>Snow </em>v. <em>Blount, </em>182 Mass. 489, 491. <em>Davis &amp; O\u2019Connor Co. </em>v. <em>Shell Oil Co. Inc. </em>311 Mass. 401, 405. <em>Tehan </em>v. <em>Security Natl. Bank, </em>340 Mass. 176, 183. It is no answer for the plaintiff to argue that the defendant has refused a tender and, therefore, no further tender need be made. A plaintiff\u2019s equitable relief may be granted conditionally. <em>Jurewicz </em>v. <em>Jurewicz, </em>317 Mass. 512, 517. <em>Kressler </em>v. <em>Flynn, </em>323 Mass. 610, 612-613. <em>Nissenberg </em>v. <em>Felleman, </em>339 Mass. 717, 724. <em>Tehan </em>v. <em>Security Natl. Bank, supra, </em>183-184.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>The final decree must be modified by requiring that the plaintiff either pay $9,500 to the defendant or give security for the payment of that sum as a condition of becoming a party. Except to the extent of the payments which will have been made by the plaintiff, the defendant will be entitled up to $9,500 of the damages awarded and the plaintiff to any excess. The defendant is to have costs under G-. L. c. 261, \u00a7 25A (as amended through St. 1965, c. 410).</p>\n<p id=\"b263-5\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b260-7\"> Wo precise date of registration appears in the record.
