This hole gave access to a vertical ladder to the sidewalk. The case is before us upon exceptions to the trial judge\u2019s refusal to direct a verdict for the defendant (Ellis) and to enter a verdict for Ellis under leave reserved. The evidence is stated in its aspect most favorable to Harris.</p>\n<p id=\"AWK\">Harris rented an apartment above a street floor store from Ellis in 1949 through Ellis\u2019s agent. A window in the apartment opened toward a fire escape platform running across the building from apartment to apartment. At the time of the letting, \u201cthere was someone sitting on the fire escape of the apartment across from the one . . . subsequently rented.\u201d In reply to a question, the agent told Mrs. Harris that \u201cit was permissible to use the fire escape.\u201d While the Harris family lived at the premises, use was made of the fire escape by tenants of the apartments to sit there together and to walk across the platform. The agent never objected to this use. The agent on request would remove debris from the platform.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-9\">After the 1949 letting, \u201ca sign had been added to the front of the building.\u201d In \u201csecuring it ... a wire had been strung across part of\u201d the platform.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-10\">On June 23, 1956, Harris returned to the apartment at 3:30 or 4 a.m. A \u201ctenant who lived at the other end of the fire escape came in and said that he had lost his key.\u201d Harris \u201cwent out on the fire escape for the purpose of going through the tenant\u2019s window, into his apartment and opening his door.\u201d He \u201cgrabbed the rail with his left hand and started walking to the further window.\u201d He then \u201cslipped on something,\u201d hit the wire, \u201cbounced back <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>. . . lost [Ms] balance and . . . went down through the hole.\u201d He knew that the hole and the wire were there. After the accident, witnesses saw a piece of canvas or linoleum, flower pots, and some pieces of wood or sticks on the platform near the hole. Mrs. Harris testified that she had asked the agent to clear up tMs material about a week before the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-5\">We hold that a verdict should have been directed for Ellis. We think that any invitation to use the fire escape, wMch certainly was not a common passageway for general use (cf. <em>Sullivan </em>v. <em>Hamacher, </em>339 Mass. 190, 193-195; <em>Mikaloros </em>v. <em>Stamatouras, </em>348 Mass. 700, 701), did not extend to its use at Mght as an entrance to another apartment by a tenant feeling Ms way in the dark (see <em>Palmer </em>v. <em>Boston Penny Sav. Bank, </em>301 Mass. 540, 544) to reach it. TMs was not a normal use of the fire escape, not shown by the evidence to have been lighted at night, nor was it a use reasonably comparable to any use which the agent had permitted or in wMch he had acqMesced. See <em>Wozniak\u2019s Case, </em>299 Mass. 471, 474. The landlord was not bound to keep the fire escape safe for uses to which it was not meant to be put and for wMch, as a photograph in evidence indicates, it was ill smted. See <em>Cohen </em>v. <em>Davies, </em>305 Mass. 152, 154. See also <em>Lally </em>v. <em>A. W. Perry, Inc. </em>277 Mass. 463, 467. Cf. <em>Rice </em>v. <em>Rosenberg, </em>266 Mass. 520, 523, where the circumstances permitted the inference that the landlord intended that the tenants should use a fire escape, not only in the event of fire, but generally in passing to and from their respective apartments. We are of opimon that no inference of such an intended use in the dark is here permissible. On tMs occasion, and in respect of this nocturnal use of the fire escape, Harris was at most a licensee. Ellis was under no duty to him to keep the fire escape safe for such uninvited use. See <em>Doran </em>v. <em>Electrical Installation Co. </em>326 Mass. 523, 524. Cf. <em>Dunn </em>v. <em>Sammet, </em>335 Mass. 162, 163; <em>Hubbard </em>v. <em>Palmer Russell Co. </em>343 Mass. 414, 416.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-6\">The cause of Harris\u2019s fall and the nature of any article upon wMch he may have stumbled are matters of conjee-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>turc. In the circumstances, causal connection between any debris not removed by the agent and the accident has not been established.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-5\">We need not consider whether Harris\u2019s conduct, in undertaking to travel in the dark on the fire escape, constituted contributory negligence as matter of law. See <em>Gambardello </em>v. <em>H. J. Seiler Co. 335 </em>Mass. 49, 52; <em>Hultberg </em>v. <em>Truex, </em>344 Mass. 414, 419; <em>Gidge </em>v. <em>Security Realty Co. </em>347 Mass. 779.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-6\">\n<em>Exceptions sustained.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"Ahs\">\n<em>Judgment for the defendant.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
