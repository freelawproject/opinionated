(Pioneer) operates a licensed retail liquor package goods store in Mattapan. It was charged by the commission with violation of G. L. c. 138, \u00a7 25C (see St. 1952, c. 385, and e. 567, \u00a7 l<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>), in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"3\">*3</page-number>selling an alcoholic beverage<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> at a price less than the minimum consumer resale price therefor. Upon an order to show cause why Pioneer\u2019s license should not he suspended or revoked, a hearing was held before the commission on April 30,1963.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-5\">On August 1, 1963, the commission by letter notified Pioneer of its findings (see fn. 3) and that its license would be suspended for six days. On August 29, 1963, Pioneer filed in the Superior Court a petition under G-. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14, for review of the board\u2019s decision. The following facts, alleged in the petition, were stipulated: Distillers Products Sales Corporation (Distillers), the filer of the schedules for minimum consumer resale prices including the price for the alcoholic beverage allegedly improperly sold,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> notwithstanding that it was fully authorized under its wholesaler\u2019s license to do so, did not have in Massachusetts (as of the time of the hearing and during 1963) either <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>any warehouse or any inventory of alcoholic beverages. Distillers made no sales in Massachusetts.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-5\">It appears that the commission did not hold a public hearing preceded by any notice prior to its purported approval of the minimum consumer resale prices for March and April, 1963. On February 7, 1963, the commission adopted two votes, (1) to approve certain price schedules for the months of March and April as not being excessive, inadequate, or unfairly discriminatory, and (2) that the foregoing vote and regulation be declared an \u201cemergency\u201d regulation so that it would \u201cbecome effective without conformance with the notice and public hearing requirements of\u201d G. L. c. 30A, \u201cthere being insufficient time in this instance for the [c] ommission to comply and it being contrary to the public interest to allow the months of March and April to pass without the establishment of legal and proper [m]inimum [c] onsumer [rjesale [p]rices as authorized by\u201d \u00a7 25C.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> On February 14,1963, the Governor and Council \u201cvoted to approve the [s]ehedule of [m]inimum [c] onsumer [r]esale [p] rice [s] \u201d which had been submitted to them by the commission on February 7, 1963. On February 25, 1963, the commission wrote to the filers of price schedules advising them of the commission\u2019s action \u201c (1) in the absence of any information to the effect that the . . . prices are . . . \u2018excessive, inadequate, or unfairly discriminatory\u2019 . . . [see \u00a7 250 (d)] and (2) upon your continuing assurance that this is the fact.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b44-6\">By motion to dismiss and requests for rulings filed with the commission, Pioneer attempted in connection with the hearing on the alleged violation to raise two principal issues : (1) whether the regulation as it applied to the particular branded beverage was invalid because the minimum price schedule was filed by Distillers, which was not a \u201c whole<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>saler selling such brand,\u201d under c. 138, \u00a7 250 (c) (2), see fn. 2; and (2) whether the whole March-April price schedule was valid at all, in view of its approval by the commission, purporting to act under the \u201cemergency\u201d provisions of G-. L. c. 30 A, \u00a72 (3) or \u00a7 3 (3),<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> without prior notice and public hearing. The commission denied the motion to dismiss and the requests for rulings. A judge of the Superior Court ruled that no constitutional provisions were violated, that the commission did not commit error of law, that its procedures were not unlawful, and that its decision was not \u201cunsupported by substantial evidence.\u201d By final decree, the commission\u2019s decision was affirmed. Pioneer appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-5\">1. The price schedule for the particular branded beverage was filed by a person (see <em>Kneeland Liquor, Inc. </em>v. <em>Alcoholic Beverages Control Commn. </em>345 Mass. 228, 232) who could properly make such a filing under Gr. L. c. 138, \u00a7 250 (c), see fn. 2. The stipulations established that Distillers did not come within either clause (1) or clause (2) of par. (c). Distillers, however, was within clause (3) permitting a filing by \u201cany wholesaler, with the approval of the commission, in the event that the owner of such brand does not file.\u201d The owner of the brand did not file. The commission\u2019s acceptance of the filing made by Distillers, a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>licensed wholesaler, and the commission\u2019s subsequent approval of the filed price constituted sufficient \u201capproval of the commission\u201d in respect of the filing itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-5\">2. In <em>Kneeland Liquor, Inc. </em>v. <em>Alcoholic Beverages Control Commn. </em>345 Mass. 228, among other things this court (1) held (p. 233) that the commission\u2019s approval of minimum price schedules under \u00a7 25C constitutes a \u201cregulation\u201d under G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 1 (5); and (2) rejected (p. 234) the commission\u2019s contention that package store dealers, when charged with a violation of an \u201capproved\u201d minimum price schedule, are \u201cestopped from raising the issue of the denial of hearing\u201d on the schedule by \u201cnot insisting upon the right to be heard.\u201d Without deciding whether commission action to avoid a hearing could have been taken under either c. 30 A, \u00a72 (3) or \u00a73 (3), see fn. 6, the <em>Kneeland </em>case (p. 235) determined that, since there had been neither a hearing nor \u201cemergency\u201d action under \u00a72 (3) or \u00a73 (3), \u201cthe regulations [of which a violation was there alleged] were invalidly enacted and there was no legally established minimum sale price.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b46-6\">Although \u201cemergency\u201d action to avoid a hearing was attempted by the commission in the present cases, we still need not deal with the question left undecided in the <em>Kneeland </em>case, viz. whether the approved schedule now before us was a regulation of the type described in \u00a7 2 or one within the ambit of \u00a7 3. The commission took emergency action which, if it was valid, would be adequate whether the price schedule was a regulation of the type described in \u00a7 2, or one of the type described in \u00a7 3. We thus need not determine (1) whether this is the type of regulation a violation of which may be punished under G. L. c. 138, \u00a7 62 (as amended through St. 1935, c. 440, \u00a7 39) by a fine or imprisonment (see c. 30A, \u00a7 2), or (2) whether the schedule was a regulation as to which a hearing was \u201crequired by any law,\u201d or by constitutional requirement for a hearing. See discussion in <em>Milligan </em>v. <em>Board of Registration in Pharmacy, </em>348 Mass. 491, 495-499, and Davis, Administrative Law Treatise, \u00a7\u00a7 7.01, 7.06, 7.07 (and 1965 pocket parts).</p>\n<p id=\"b47-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>The question whether, under c. 30A, \u00a7 2 (3), a hearing can be avoided by the commission or whether, under c. 30A, \u00a73 (3), an opportunity to present views may be avoided must be considered in the light of c. 138, \u00a7 250 (d), making it necessary for the commission to determine that the prices approved by it are \u201cnot . . . excessive, inadequate, or unfairly discriminatory.\u201d This provision is a statutory standard similar to standards which are applicable to the administrative fixing of rates for various services affected with a public interest; e.g. motor vehicle liability insurance, <em>Massachusetts Bonding &amp; Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Ins. </em>329 Mass. 265, 270 (\u201cadequate, just, reasonable and non-discriminatory . . . charges,\u201d G. L. c. 175, \u00a7 113B, as amended); medical insurance, <em>Massachusetts Medical Serv. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Ins. </em>344 Mass. 335, 338-340 (rates may not be \u201cexcessive, inadequate or unfairly discriminatory,\u201d G. L. c. 176B, \u00a7 4, as amended); <em>S. C. </em>346 Mass. 346. See also, as to certain public utility rates and practices; G. L. c. 164, \u00a7\u00a7 93, 94; <em>Boston Consol. Gas Co. </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Util. </em>321 Mass. 259, 267-268;<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>Boston Real Estate Bd. </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Util. </em>334 Mass. 477, 495 (implicit standard of \u201cpublic interest\u201d). Even apart from c. 30A, the standard of approval prescribed by \u00a7 25C (d) seems to presuppose the existence of substantial evidence<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> upon the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>basis of which approval may be justified. Such evidence would be obtained most readily by the commission through a hearing at which the evidence may be placed in the record, if, indeed, such a hearing is not essential. See <em>American Employers\u2019 Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Ins. </em>298 Mass. 161, 166-170 (which, however, may rest, in part at least, upon the specific statutory procedural provisions there considered). The commission, of course, is not intended by \u00a7 25G (d) blindly to endorse any schedule of prices submitted to it. On the contrary, the commission must decide upon some form of substantial information or evidence whether such prices comply with the statutory standard. See <em>Bond Liquor Store, Inc. </em>v. <em>Alcoholic Beverages Control Commn. </em>336 Mass. 70, 73.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-4\">This is the background against which we must determine whether the commission, under e. 30A, \u00a7 2 (3) or \u00a7 3 (3), has properly given \u201cemergency\u201d approval of price schedules for March and April, 1963, without notice and hearing or opportunity to present views. The commission\u2019s vote of February 7, 1963 (see fn. 5, and related text), does not describe the \u201cemergency\u201d in detail, other than to say (a) that there was not time to comply with the notice and public hearing requirements of c. 30A, and (b) that it was contrary to the public interest to have no minimum prices in effect in March and April, 1963.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-5\">The vote strongly suggests that the occasion for the exercise of the \u201cemergency\u201d provision of \u00a7 2 (3) or \u00a7 3 (3) was that the commission encountered difficulties in arranging to comply with \u00a7 25G as interpreted in the <em>Kneeland </em>case, 345 Mass. 228, decided December 12, 1962. This was about thirty days prior to the last day (January 10, 1963) for price filings for March and April, 1963. The record does not disclose what these difficulties were, but it is probable that the commission\u2019s prior practices had to be materially changed in the light of the <em>Kneeland </em>decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-6\">These \u201cemergency\u201d provisions, see fn. 6, permit deviation from the prescribed procedures where speed in the adoption or amendment of regulations is essential. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>statutory finding that the action is necessary and a statement of the reasons for such action must be included in the regulation. The provision is somewhat more explicit than the comparable provision of \u00a7 4 (a) of the Federal Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U. S. C. \u00a7 1003 (a) (1964). See Curran and Sacks, op. cit. (see fn. 7), pp. 81-82; Davis, Administrative Law Treatise, \u00a7\u00a7 6.04, 6.05.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b49-4\">Massachusetts case authority is inconclusive as to the extent of an agency\u2019s powers to declare an \u201cemergency\u201d regulation. In <em>Dacey </em>v. <em>Milk Control Commn. </em>340 Mass. 681, 684-685, we upheld an \u201cemergency\u201d order or regulation under \u00a7 2 (3) requiring milk dealers to produce, on an industry-wide basis, information needed for further regulatory activity. This order, however, was more limited in substantive effect than the order now before us. In other instances, as in the <em>Kneeland </em>case (345 Mass. 228, 235), the agency did not purport to act under emergency provisions. See <em>Massachusetts Gen. Hosp. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Pub. Welfare, </em>346 Mass. 739, 740, fn. 2. See also <em>Commissioner of Labor &amp; Indus. </em>v. <em>Boston Housing Authy. </em>345 Mass. 406, 415, fn. 10. We recognize that \u201cemergency\u201d findings under c. 30A must be carefully scrutinized because, if unwarrantably made, they may lead to improper denial of public hearings or comment on regulations, to evasion of the salutary purposes of c. 30A and possibly to other serious abuse. See Heady, Administrative Procedure Legislation in the States, 40-49.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-5\">Despite the meager character of the commission\u2019s statement of the \u201cemergency\u201d in respect of its approval of the price schedules, we cannot say that it was insufficient. The commission\u2019s statement must be viewed in the light of the commission\u2019s apparent difficulty in adjusting itself to compliance with \u00a7 250 as interpreted in the <em>Kneeland </em>decision. The record does not justify us in concluding that the com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>mission had no substantial basis for the finding that the public interest required promulgation of some price schedule for March and April, 1963.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b50-5\">3. We have dealt with these cases upon the assumption that St. 1963, c. 258, amending c. 138, \u00a7 25C (d), has no application. See fn. 2, sentence following point [A]. The commission\u2019s decision approving the March-April, 1963, price schedules took place on February 7,1963. The schedule took effect on March 1, 1963. Pioneer\u2019s alleged violation took place on March 23, 1963, although the alleged violations in the Grandolfo and the Orlandella cases (see fn. 1), took place on April 20, 1963. Chapter 258 did not become effective until April 11, 1963. We see no basis for supposing that c. 258 was intended to have retroactive effect with respect to earlier commission determinations and to regulations then already in effect. See <em>Building Inspector of Acton </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Acton, </em>348 Mass. 453, 456-457, and cases cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-6\">4. It is not necessary to recite in detail the facts in the companion cases (see fn. 1). We have reviewed them. The same principles of law are applicable as in the Pioneer ease. We see no special circumstances of either companion case which would lead to any different result. In each of these three cases, the final decree is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b42-11\"> Section 250, as it existed prior to St. 1963, c. 258, and St. 1965, c. 428 (rewriting par. [e]), is set forth below. Chapter 258 amended par. (d) by striking out the italicized words and adding the bracketed words shown below in the sentence immediately following the bracketed letter [A] (inserted for convenient reference). \u201cSection 250. (a) No brand of alcoholic beverages shall be sold within the commonwealth to a wholesaler or retailer, and no manufacturer or wholesaler shall sell . . . any alcoholic beverages, the container of which bears a label stating the brand or the name of the owner or producer, unless a schedule of minimum consumer prices for each such brand of . . . beverages shall first have been filed with the commission and is then in effect, (b) Each of the schedules . . . shall contain, with respect to each item . . . the minimum consumer resale price of a bottle and of a case . . . which prices shall be uniform throughout the commonwealth, (c) Such schedule shall be filed by (1) the manufacturer or wholesaler who owns such brand, if licensed by the commission; or (2) a wholesaler selling such brand who is appointed in writing by the brand owner as exclusive agent for the purpose of filing such schedule, if the brand owner is not licensed by the commission; or (3) any wholesaler, with the approval of the commission, in the event that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"3\">*3</page-number>the owner of such brand does not file or is unable to file a schedule or designate an agent for such purpose, (d) . . .

(3) If the agency finds that immediate adoption ... of a regulation is necessary for the preservation of the public health, safety or general welfare, and that observance of the requirements of notice and public hearing would be contrary to the public interest, the agency may dispense with such requirements and adopt the regulation ... as an emergency regulation ....

Section 3 deals with regulations other than those subject to \u00a7 2, and par. (3) permits dispensing, in certain cases, with any prior opportunity to present views about such a proposed regulation.

See G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 1 (1); <em>Salisbury Water Supply Co. </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Util. </em>344 Mass. 716, 718 (rate hearings for this single company \u201cadjudicatory\u201d under C.

The language of the commission\u2019s letter (to the filers of the price schedules) of February 25, 1963, quoted <em>supra, </em>strongly suggests undue reliance by the commission on the judgment of the filers and upon the \u201cabsence of any information\u201d that the prices filed did not meet the standards found in \u00a7 25C (d). The price schedule, however, was to be in effect only for two months and thus was within the time limitations for an \u201cemergency\u201d regulation, even under \u00a7 2 (3,). That section and \u00a7 3 (3) imply that an \u201cemergency\u201d regulation may be necessary upon occasion where opportunity for adequate hearing ,and detailed study does not exist.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
