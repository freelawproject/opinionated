(d). Each of the three cases (discussed in this opinion) is a petition for review of a decision of the commission that, upon a specified day in June or July, 1963, a licensed retail package store licensee sold a beverage at less than the purported minimum consumer resale price. One companion case was brought by Blanchard\u2019s West Boxbury, Inc. and the other by Orlandella Grocery Company, Inc. There is no occasion for stating the facts in the companion cases. They are similar to those in the case brought by White\u2019s and are governed by the same principles of law.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b51-16\">Cutter, J,</author>\n<p id=\"ACQ\">These cases arise under G. L. c. 138, \u00a7 250, as it stood after the effective date of St. 1963, c. 258,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>amending par. (d) of \u00a7 25C. White\u2019s Liquor Mart, Inc. (White\u2019s) was charged hy the commission with selling on July 2, 1963, a bottle of vodka for $4.75, which was less than the minimum consumer resale price of $5.49 approved on June 4, 1963, by the commission to be in effect for the months of July and August, 1963. The commission, because this was a <em>\u2018</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>second offense during the [then] current license year,\u201d suspended White\u2019s package store license for fifteen days.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-4\">White\u2019s then filed, under G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14, a petition for review of the commission\u2019s decision. The trial judge found that \u201c [n]o filing of the material [m]inimum [c]onsumer [r]esale [p]rices had been made with the Secretary of the Commonwealth in accordance with\u201d G. L. c. 30, \u00a7 37 (as amended through St. 1951, c. 556, \u00a7 1), which reads, so far as relevant, \u201cNotwithstanding any special or general law, every . . . commission, . . . vested by law with the power to make and issue rules or regulations general in scope, shall file an attested copy thereof, together with a citation of the law by authority of which the same purport to have been issued, with the state secretary, and such rules or regulations, whether or not they require the approval of the governor and council . . . before taking effect, shall not take effect until so filed.\u201d The judge ruled that c. 30, \u00a7 37, was applicable to these minimum prices, and ordered that the commission\u2019s decision (suspending White\u2019s license) be quashed. The commission appealed from a final decree in accordance with the judge\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-5\">The judge\u2019s ruling was correct. No minimum price schedule ever became effective for July and August, 1963, because of the commission\u2019s failure to file the schedule <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>with the Secretary of the Commonwealth. Nothing in the 1963 amendment (St. 1963, c. 258, see fn. 2) of c. 138, \u00a7 25C (d), purported to relieve the bimonthly price schedules, which inherently were regulations, from the provisions of c. 30, \u00a7 37, as amended. Section 37 operated, by its own terms, and of its own force, to prevent the price schedules from taking effect. See <em>Massachusetts Gen. Hosp. </em>v. <em>Cambridge, </em>347 Mass. 519, 522-523. The provision of St. 1963, c. 258, to the effect that G. L. c. 30A is no longer to govern approval of a price schedule under c. 138, \u00a7 25C (d), did not make c. 30, \u00a7 37, inapplicable, notwithstanding the reference to c. 30, \u00a7 37, found in c. 30A, \u00a7 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-4\">The purchases, alleged to be in violation of \u00a7 25C, in the case brought by Blanchard\u2019s West Boxbury, Inc. and in the case brought by Orlandella Grocery Company, Inc. (fn. 1) were made, respectively, on June 6 and 11, 1963. The trial judge found in each of these companion cases that the material minimum consumer resale prices (those for May and June, 1963) had not been filed with the Secretary of the Commonwealth as required by c. 30, \u00a7 37. Accordingly, on the dates of these purchases, no valid minimum price schedule had ever become effective for the months of May and June, 1963.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-5\">In each of these three cases (see fn. 1) the final decree is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b51-22\"> Statute 1963, c. 258, which contains an emergency preamble, was approved on April 11, 1963.' It amended \u00a7 25C, by striking out the second subpara-graph of par. (d) and inserting the following: \u201cNo such filing, however, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>shall take effect unless within thirty days thereafter the commission shall approve such prices as not being excessive, inadequate, or unfairly discriminatory; provided, however, <em>that such approval shall not he Seemed a rule or regulation within the meaning of section twenty-four or section seventy-one, nor shall such approval he subject to the provisions of chapter thirty A\u201d </em>(emphasis supplied). General Laws c. 138, \u00a7 24 (as amended through St. 1952, c. 426), provided generally for the making of regulations by the commission. Section 71 (as amended through St. 1953, c. 654, \u00a7 97) provided that the commission\u2019s rules and regulations \u201cshall not take effect until approved by the governor and council.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
