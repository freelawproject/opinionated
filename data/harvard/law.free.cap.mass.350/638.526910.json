L. c. 231A as to whether the plaintiff or the defendant Leo L. Laughlin is entitled to the office of Commissioner of Public Safety. Injunctive relief is incidentally sought against the defendant Secretary of the Commonwealth. From a final decree in favor of the defendant Laughlin the plaintiff appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-7\">1. The defendants demurred to the bill on the ground that \u201cthere is no jurisdiction in equity\u201d to make a determination as to \u201cthe right to hold a given public office.\u201d There are appeals by the defendants from the interlocutory decree overruling the demurrer and from the final decree \u201cfor the purpose of saving the procedural question.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The demurrer was properly overruled. Since the enactment of G. L. c. 231A the right to try title to office is not exclusively by petition for writ of mandamus. There is an actual controversy between the plaintiff and the defendant Laughlin. No reason is apparent why this type of controversy should be excepted from the remedial objective of c. 231A expressed in \u00a7 9: \u201cIts purpose is to remove, and to afford relief from, uncertainty and insecurity with respect to rights, duties, status and other legal relations, and it is to be liberally construed and administered.\u201d See <em>Commissioner of Admn. </em>v. <em>Kelley, ante, </em>501, 504-505.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-8\">2. On July 20,1961, Frank S. Giles was appointed Commissioner of Public Safety. By St. 1962, c. 390, enacted April 27,1962, his term of office was extended to \u201cfive years from the date on which he was appointed.\u201d On March 30, 1964, he was suspended from his office pursuant to G. L. c. 30, \u00a7 59 (as amended through St. 1963, c. 829, \u00a7\u00a7 1, 2). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"640\">*640</page-number><em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Giles, ante, </em>102. On December 23, 1964, following an intervening appointment and resignation of another individual, the plaintiff was appointed \u201cto be the temporary Commissioner of the Department of Public Safety\u201d pursuant to and subject to the provisions of \u00a7 59. On September 27,1965, Giles resigned as commissioner, and on the following day his resignation was accepted by the Governor. On September 29 the defendant Laughlin was appointed and qualified as Commissioner of Public Safety.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-4\">After finding the foregoing facts, the Superior Court judge ruled that the defendant Laughlin is \u201cthe legally and duly qualified Commissioner of Public Safety .... The fact that Mr. Giles\u2019s term had been extended<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> . . . did not and does not entitle the \u201e . . [plaintiff], who was appointed as the \u2018. . . . temporary officer . . . who shall have all the powers and duties of the . . . officer suspended . . .\u2019 as provided by Section 59, to continue to serve as the \u2018temporary officer\u2019 upon and after the appointment and qualification of . . . Laughlin, who has been designated by the governor to fill the vacancy created by the Giles resignation, so-called.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b680-5\">The material portions of G. L. c. 30, \u00a7 59, are the following: \u201cAn officer ... of any department . . . created by the general court, may, during any period such officer . . . is under indictment for misconduct in such office . . ., if he was appointed by the governor, be suspended .... During the period of any such suspension, the appointing authority may fill the position of the suspended officer . . . on a temporary basis, and the temporary officer . . . shall have all the powers and duties of the officer . . . suspended. ... If the criminal proceedings against the person suspended are terminated without a finding or verdict of guilty on any of the charges on which he was indicted, his suspension shall be forthwith removed . . ..\u201d See, generally, <em>Bessette </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Pub. Works, </em>348 Mass. 605, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"641\">*641</page-number>608-609; <em>Reynolds </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Commerce &amp; Dev. ante, </em>193,194.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-5\">The above rulings were correct. The plain meaning of $ 59 is that a temporary appointment should be for the duration of the suspension. In this case the suspension was terminated by the resignation of the suspended officer. Thereafter the temporary appointee continued to have none of the suspended officer\u2019s powers and duties. We reject the construction urged by the plaintiff that the only effective basis for ending the temporary status of the officer must be by the termination of the proceedings against the suspended officer without a verdict or finding of guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-6\">\"What we have said also disposes of the plaintiff\u2019s contention under G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 30, \u00a7 8, that he had not been <em>\u2018</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>removed. \u2019 \u2019<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b681-7\">No weight can be given to any argument based upon the wording of the plaintiff\u2019s commission as temporary commissioner which stated that he is \u201cto hold said trust until criminal proceedings against the suspended commissioner are terminated\u201d and which authorizes him \u201cto execute and perform all the duties,\u201d and which invests him \u201cwith all the powers and responsibilities, which by our Constitution and laws, do or may pertain to the said office, so long as he shall hold the same by virtue of these presents.\u201d If the commission purports to give a longer tenure than authorized by the statute, which we do not decide, it is to that extent null and void.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-8\">The trial judge correctly ruled that the letter sent to the Governor by Giles could not affect or control the effect of $59.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-9\">\n<em>Decree affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b679-9\"> The defendants\u2019 petition for late appeal from the final decree was allowed by the county court. G. L. c. 214, \u00a7 28.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b680-6\"><em> </em>A finding or ruling that the term of Giles was extended five years from April 27, 1962, instead of five years from the date of his appointment, is erroneous, but immaterial.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b681-10\"> \u201cA public officer appointed for any term by the governor . . . shall hold his office during the term for which he is appointed . . .\u25a0 unless he is sooner removed in accordance with law.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
