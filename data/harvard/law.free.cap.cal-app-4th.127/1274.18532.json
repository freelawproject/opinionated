It also sustained the allegation that the offenses involved more than one victim. Based on these findings, the trial court sentenced the defendant to state prison for two consecutive indeterminate life terms for at least 30 years, with concurrent terms for all the remaining convictions.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1058-8\">On appeal, the defendant contends the prosecutor committed misconduct, and the trial court erred when it failed to instruct the jury to consider the past criminal conduct of a witness, allowed his trial to proceed in his absence after he failed to appear on the final day of trial, and violated his constitutional right to have a jury determine every necessary fact. In the published portion of our opinion we reject this last contention by holding that the proviso in Penal Code section 667.61, subdivision (c)(7) (that a defendant is unqualified for probation), is not an element of the enhancement to be negated upon proof to a jury. We shall affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1058-9\">The defendant\u2019s arguments do not require us to summarize the entirety of the testimony at trial. To the extent necessary for context, we will incorporate facts in the Discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1058-10\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b1058-11\">\n<em>I, II</em>\n<footnotemark>\n<em>*</em>\n</footnotemark>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1059-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1277\">*1277</page-number>\n<em>III</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1059-5\">As noted above, after returning 30 verdicts that found the defendant guilty of committing nondescript lewd and lascivious acts upon two victims under the age of 14 (Pen. Code, \u00a7 288, subd. (a); subsequent undesignated section references are to this code), the jury returned the self-evident finding that these violations involved two or more victims \u201cwithin the meaning of . . . Section 667.61(e)(5).\u201d Under section 667.61 (the internal cross-references in which render it a veritable hall of mirrors), a defendant convicted of any offense in subdivision (c) under one circumstance contained in subdivision (e) is subject to an indeterminate life term of at least 15 years. (\u00a7 667.61, subd. (b).) Among the qualifying offenses <em>(id., </em>subd. (c)(7)) is section 288, subdivision (a), unless the defendant is eligible for probation (\u00a7 1203.066, subd. (c)). Among the circumstances that qualify the offense for an enhanced sentence under section 667.61 is committing a \u201csubdivision (c)\u201d offense against more than one victim. (\u00a7 667.61, subd. (e)(5).)</p>\n<p id=\"b1059-6\">Under <em>Blakely </em>v. <em>Washington </em>(2004) 542 U.S. 296 [159 L.Ed.2d 403, 124 S.Ct. 2531], any fact other than \u201crecidivism\u201d that increases the punishment for an offense beyond the \u201cstatutory maximum\u201d (the maximum a trial court may impose on facts necessarily reflected in the jury verdict for the offense) must be the subject of a jury finding. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 303 [159 L.Ed.2d at pp. 413-414].) Here, pursuant to the pleading and proof provision of section 667.61, subdivision (i), the jury expressly found the defendant guilty of an offense within the meaning of subdivision (e)(5), which in turn incorporates any offense in subdivision (c) committed against multiple victims.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The jury, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1278\">*1278</page-number>of course, had already found the defendant guilty of section 288, subdivision (a). What the defendant faults is the lack of an explicit jury finding that he was ineligible for probation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1060-4\">Contrary to defendant\u2019s contention, we find that the proviso in Penal Code section 667.61, subdivision (c)(7) (that a defendant is unqualified for probation) is not an element of the enhancement to be negated upon proof to a jury. Rather, it is a legislative grant of authority to the trial court to entertain a request for probation (should a defendant satisfy the criteria in section 1203.066, subd. (c)) despite eligibility otherwise for sentencing under section 667.61. Unlike the defendant, we do not find that this interpretation would render the proviso redundant. Subdivision (h) of section 667.61 concerns the <em>prohibition </em>of a grant of probation to persons committing the offenses in the <em>other six paragraphs </em>of subdivision (c) (\u00a7 667.61, subd. (c)(1)\u2014(6), which is an apparent effort to dispel any ambiguity resulting from the lack of any express reference to the subject of probation in those paragraphs. Thus, section 667.61, subdivision (c)(7)\u2019s proviso and subdivision (h) do not address the same issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b1060-6\">Finding a defendant ineligible for probation is not a form of punishment, because probation itself is an act of clemency on the part of the trial court. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Superior Court (Kirby) </em>(2003) 114 Cal.App.4th 102, 105-106 [7 Cal.Rptr.3d 440].) Because a defendant\u2019s eligibility for probation results in a <em>reduction </em>rather than an increase in the sentence prescribed for his offenses, it is not subject to the rule of <em>Blakely. </em>(Cf. <em>People v. Barasa </em>(2002) 103 Cal.App.4th 287, 293, 294-295 [126 Cal.Rptr.2d 628] [eligibility for diversion]; <em>People v. Cleveland </em>(2001) 87 Cal.App.4th 263, 270-271 [104 Cal.Rptr.2d 641] [section 654].) As a result, the enhancement of his molestation convictions did not offend his constitutional rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b1061-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1279\">*1279</page-number>\n<em>IV</em>\n<footnotemark>\n<em>*</em>\n</footnotemark>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1061-5\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b1061-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1061-7\">Blease, Acting P. J., and Hull, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b1061-8\">A petition for rehearing was denied April 15, 2005, and appellant\u2019s petition for review by the Supreme Court was denied July 20, 2005. George, C. J., and Baxter, J., did not participate therein.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1058-12\"> Both parties assert that the court also imposed a consecutive six-year determinate term. This is not correct. The reporter\u2019s transcript clearly quotes the court stating that, \u201cFor Counts Two through Ten, the Court will impose the mid term ... to run concurrent with each other and with the first count, [f] For Counts 12 through 30, the defendant will be sentenced to the mid term . . . concurrent with each other and concurrent with Count 11 .... [&lt;\u00a1[1 So that the aggregate state prison sentence is 30 years to life.\u201d The misapprehension may stem from unclear notations on the first pages of the two abstracts of judgment for the determinate sentence, which do not describe the term on count two as concurrent. However, the final pages indicate that the determinate sentence is \u201cto run c/c with indeterminate.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b1058-13\">See footnote, <em>ante, </em>page 1274.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1059-7\"> Section 667.61 provides, in relevant part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1059-8\">\u201c(b) Except as provided in subdivision (a) [circumstances not applicable here], a person who is convicted of an offense specified in subdivision (c) under one of the circumstances specified in subdivision (e) shall be punished by imprisonment in the state prison for life and shall not be eligible for release on parole for 15 years except as provided in subdivision (j).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1059-9\">\u201c(c) This section shall apply to any of the following offenses:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1059-10\">\u201c(1) A violation of paragraph (2) of subdivision (a) of Section 261.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1059-11\">\u201c(2) A violation of paragraph (1) of subdivision (a) of Section 262.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1059-12\">\u201c(3) A violation of Section 264.1.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1059-13\">\u201c(4) A violation of subdivision (b) of Section 288.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1059-14\">\u201c(5) A violation of subdivision (a) of Section 289.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1059-15\">\u201c(6) Sodomy or oral copulation in violation of Section 286 or 288a by force, violence, duress, menace, or fear of immediate and unlawful bodily injury on the victim or another person.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1059-16\">\u201c(7) A violation of subdivision (a) of Section 288 [of which the defendant was convicted, as noted <em>ante] </em>unless the defendant qualifies for probation under subdivision (c) of Section 1203.066. ffl] ... ffl]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1059-17\">\u201c(e) The following circumstances shall apply to the offenses specified in subdivision (c): ffl] . . . ffl] (5) The defendant has been convicted in the present case or cases of committing an offense specified in subdivision (c) against more than one victim [also present here], ffl] ... ffl]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1060-7\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1278\">*1278</page-number>\u201c(h) Probation shall not be granted to, nor shall the execution or imposition of sentence be suspended for, any person who is subject to punishment under this section for any offense specified in paragraphs (1) to (6), inclusive ....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1060-8\">\u201c(i) For the penalties provided in this section to apply, the existence of any fact required under subdivision (d) [not applicable here] or (e) shall be alleged in the accusatory pleading and either admitted by the defendant in open court or found to be true by the trier of fact.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1060-9\">Section 1203.066 provides, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1060-10\">\u201c(a) Notwithstanding Section 1203 or any other law, probation shall not be granted to, nor shall the execution or imposition of sentence be suspended for, nor shall a finding bringing the defendant within the provisions of this section be stricken pursuant to Section 1385 for, any of the following persons: [ID ...
