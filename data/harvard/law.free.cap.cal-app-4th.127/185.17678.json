Although no Penal Code section 186.22, subdivision (b)(1)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> gang enhancement was alleged, and although there was no evidence the charged crimes were related to any gang activity, the trial court admitted, over Avitia\u2019s objection, evidence that gang graffiti was found in Avitia\u2019s bedroom. In the published portion of the opinion, we conclude that admission of this evidence, which was unrelated to any issue at trial, requires reversal of Avitia\u2019s conviction for grossly negligent discharge of a firearm. In the unpublished portion of the opinion, we conclude the trial court further erred by allowing Avitia to be impeached with evidence he had failed to abide by the conditions of his probation, and that the evidence was sufficient to support the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-10\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"AeR\">1. <em>Facts.</em></p>\n<p id=\"A_0\">a. <em>People\u2019s case.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b197-11\">On February 22, 2003, at approximately 3:30 p.m., Angelica Gaeta called 911 reporting that Avitia had fired two shots from a handgun five minutes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>earlier. As Gaeta spoke with the 911 operator, she stated, \u201cYou know when they\u2019re shooting the guns and there\u2019s not bullets in it? [][]... [f] They\u2019re doing that right now.\u201d The operator asked, \u201cThey\u2019re dry firing it?\u201d and Gaeta replied affirmatively. She stated, \u201cAnd this is happening . . . just. . . way too much .... It\u2019s like the third time.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b198-5\">Deputy Sheriff Martin Rios and his partner responded to the call. Gaeta told Rios she had \u201cheard . . . two to three gunshots that were fired by her neighbor\u201d in his backyard. In a field showup, Gaeta identified Avitia as the shooter. Gaeta stated that the firearm was a handgun about the size of Avitia\u2019s hand, but could not say what type or color. Avitia had held the gun in one hand while shooting. Based upon Gaeta\u2019s description, Rios concluded the firearm in question was a handgun. Gaeta appeared nervous about being identified as the complainant and stated she did not wish to walk outside and be seen by Avitia.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-6\">Deputies were given permission to search the Avitia residence by Avitia\u2019s father. While seated in the police car, and before the house was searched, Avitia became agitated, kicked at the windows of the police car, and yelled to his father, \u201cNo, don\u2019t let them in.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b198-7\">The search revealed numerous firearms and ammunition located in various areas of Avitia\u2019s bedroom. Deputies discovered a .177-caliber, carbon dioxide powered pellet pistol; a Taurus .38-caliber revolver, fully loaded with five live .38-caliber rounds; a Baretta 92 FS .9-millimeter, loaded with 15 live rounds; an unloaded, inoperable .357 magnum revolver; a 12-gauge shotgun; and a Romak Model 991 AK-74, a Romanian version of the AK-47 assault rifle. The Taurus revolver had an approximate two-inch barrel, and was one of the smallest ,38\u2019s available. Deputy Brandt House, who participated in the search, did not examine the pellet gun closely.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-8\">An extra magazine containing 15 rounds was found with the Baretta. Next to the bed was a large, military-style ammunition box containing two 30-round magazines, fully loaded with 7.62 by 39-millimeter rounds consistent with the assault rifle. Several loose rounds were also in the ammunition container. An empty \u201cspeedy loader,\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> four expended ,38-caliber casings, and one live .38-caliber round, were sitting on the bed. The casings were not tested to determine from which firearm they had been shot. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>However, the casings were .38-caliber and could have been fired from the .38-millimeter Taurus revolver, but not from any of the other firearms found in Avitia\u2019s bedroom. The Taurus .38-caliber revolver smelled as if it had been recently fired. \u201cChivo\u201d was tattooed on Avitia\u2019s left hand and written on the ammunition box, as well as on other items in the room. According to the prosecutor, \u201cChivo\u201d was also scratched on the butt of the assault rifle. Gang graffiti was present on several of the posters in Avitia\u2019s room.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-5\">According to Deputy House, it is legal to possess and fire a pellet gun.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-6\">At trial, Gaeta claimed to have little or no memory of the incident.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> After her testimony, a tape recording of her 911 call was played for the jury. Deputy Phillip Solano testified that he had spoken to Gaeta and she had expressed her fear of testifying several times. On May 29, 2003, the Thursday before trial began, Gaeta telephoned Solano and told him she did not wish to testify. Approximately one week prior to her call, Avitia\u2019s father had gone to Gaeta\u2019s home, told her not to come to court and not to testify, and stated that he did not know what his son would do when he was released from jail. Gaeta was \u201cvery afraid.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b199-7\">After the 911 tape was played in her presence, Gaeta admitted regaining some of her memory of the incident. She testified that she was not familiar with handguns and did not know whether a pellet gun sounded different than other firearms. When presented with both the pellet gun and the .38-caliber Taurus revolver, Gaeta stated she did not know which gun she had seen being fired. She testified she had not been wearing her contact lenses at the time, and would not have been able to tell the difference between the firearms.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-8\">A licensed gun dealer, testifying as an expert, stated that the AK-74 was an assault weapon. Prior to January 1, 2000, sales of the AK-74 were legal.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>b. <em>Defense case.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b200-5\">Avitia testified in his own defense. He claimed that he had been shooting at a can in the backyard with the pellet pistol. He admitted that with the exception of the .9-millimeter Baretta, all the weapons found in the bedroom were his, as was the ammunition box. He and his father occasionally went to target practice together, and the spent casings found on the bed had come from such target practice. He did not know why he saved the casings. During cross-examination, he demonstrated holding the pellet pistol, and described it as being approximately twice as big as his hand. The pellet gun made a sound when fired, but did not sound like a tire exploding. The .38-caliber revolver made a louder sound when fired than did the pellet pistol.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-6\">Avitia admitted owning the AK-74 rifle. He further admitted he had not registered it. He had purchased it in Los Angeles County in 1999, and believed it had been registered when he purchased it.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-7\">Avitia also admitted that on May 28, 2002, he had pleaded guilty to carrying a concealed firearm (\u00a7 12025) and carrying a loaded firearm (\u00a7 12031). The jury was instructed that the prior convictions were admitted only for consideration on count 4, the misdemeanant in possession of a firearm charge.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b200-8\">Avitia testified that he had been a small arms repairman in the United States Marine Corps. He had served in the Marine Corps for four years, achieved the rank of lance corporal, and was honorably discharged. He had passed the Marine Corps\u2019s background check, as well as the background check run by the gun dealer when he purchased the rifle. He testified that based on his Marine Corps training, he would never fire firearms at a private residence with people living in the area.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-9\">c. <em>People\u2019s rebuttal.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b200-10\">Deputy House testified that, according to the automated California Law Enforcement Tracking System (C.L.E.T.S.), the .38-caliber Taurus and another weapon, unconnected with the instant case, had been properly registered to Avitia. The C.L.E.T.S. database did not indicate any other weapon belonging to Avitia had been registered.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>2. <em>Procedure.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b201-5\">Avitia was charged with discharging a firearm in a grossly negligent manner (\u00a7 246.3), possession of an assault weapon (\u00a7 12280, subd. (b)), the manufacture, sale, import, or loan of a large-capacity magazine (\u00a7 12020, subd. (a)(2)), and possession of a firearm by a misdemeanant (\u00a7 12021, subd. (c)(1)). At the close of the People\u2019s case, the trial court dismissed the section 12020, subdivision (a)(2) charge for insufficiency of the evidence, pursuant to section 1118.1. The jury convicted Avitia of the remaining three counts. It found true the allegation that during commission of the section 246.3 violation, Avitia personally used a firearm within the meaning of sections 1203.06, subdivision (a)(1) and 12022.5, subdivision (a). After the jury\u2019s verdict, the trial court dismissed the possession of a firearm by a misdemeanant charge because the prior convictions proved by the People were not qualifying prior convictions for purposes of section 12021, subdivision (c)(1). The trial court sentenced Avitia to a term of two years in prison, imposed a restitution fine, and assessed a suspended parole revocation fine. Avitia appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b201-7\">1. <em>The trial court\u2019s improper admission of evidence requires reversal of count 1.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b201-8\">a. <em>Admission of gang evidence.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b201-9\">Prior to trial, defense counsel moved to exclude any reference to gang graffiti found in Avitia\u2019s room on grounds the evidence was irrelevant. The prosecutor made an offer of proof that the evidence was relevant to connect Avitia to the guns. He explained that a witness would testify gang graffiti and gang names were found in the bedroom where the firearms and \u201caccessories\u201d were found; that similar gang graffiti and writing was found on ammunition boxes containing the large capacity magazines; that \u201cChivo\u201d was written on the butt of the AK-74 and on the ammunition box; and that \u201cChivo\u201d was tattooed on Avitia\u2019s hand. Defense counsel offered to stipulate to Avitia\u2019s ownership of the AK-74 rifle. The prosecutor declined to accept the stipulation. The trial court did not make a ruling on Avitia\u2019s request at that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-10\">As noted, at trial Deputy House testified that he had observed gang graffiti on posters in Avitia\u2019s room. The trial court overruled defense counsel\u2019s nonspecific objection to the testimony, on the condition the prosecutor lay a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>foundation for the evidence. The prosecutor then queried whether House had worked on the \u201cgang enforcement team.\u201d Avitia\u2019s further objection that the evidence was inadmissible under Evidence Code section 352 was overruled without discussion. House then testified that he had worked on the sheriff\u2019s department\u2019s gang enforcement team for four years; during his three-year assignment at the men\u2019s central jail and during his tenure at the Lynwood/Firestone station, he had spoken with hundreds of gang members about all aspects of gang life; he had had contact with Hispanic gangs and gang members; and had seen gang graffiti in the jails \u201c[a]ll the time.\u201d He was therefore familiar with gang graffiti. No further details were elicited regarding the nature of the graffiti observed on the posters.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-5\">b. <em>Admission of the gang evidence was error.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b202-6\">Gang evidence is admissible if it is logically relevant to some material issue in the case other than character evidence, is not more prejudicial than probative, and is not cumulative. (Evid. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 210, 352; <em>People </em>v. <em>Carter </em>(2003) 30 Cal.4th 1166, 1194 [135 Cal.Rptr.2d 553, 70 P.3d 981]; <em>People v. Ruiz </em>(1998) 62 Cal.App.4th 234, 239-240 [72 Cal.Rptr.2d 572]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Sanchez </em>(1997) 58 Cal.App.4th 1435, 1449 [69 Cal.Rptr.2d 16].) A properly qualified gang expert may, where appropriate, testify to a wide variety of matters, including gang graffiti. <em>(People v. Ochoa </em>(2001) 26 Cal.4th 398, 438-439 [110 Cal.Rptr.2d 324, 28 P.3d 78]; see also <em>People v. Killebrew </em>(2002) 103 Cal.App.4th 644, 656-657 [126 Cal.Rptr.2d 876], and authorities cited therein.)</p>\n<p id=\"b202-7\">However, gang evidence is inadmissible if introduced only to \u201cshow a defendant\u2019s criminal disposition or bad character as a means of creating an inference the defendant committed the charged offense. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(People v. Sanchez, supra, </em>58 Cal.App.4th at p. 1449; <em>People v. Ruiz, supra, </em>62 Cal.App.4th at p. 240.) In cases not involving a section 186.22 gang enhancement, it has been recognized that \u201cevidence of gang membership is potentially prejudicial and should not be admitted if its probative value is minimal. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Hernandez </em>(2004) 33 Cal.4th 1040, 1049 [16 Cal.Rptr.3d 880, 94 P.3d 1080]; see also <em>People v. Bojorquez </em>(2002) 104 Cal.App.4th 335, 345 [128 Cal.Rptr.2d 411].) Even if gang evidence is relevant, it may have a highly inflammatory impact on the jury. Thus, \u201ctrial courts should carefully scrutinize such evidence before admitting it. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(People v. Williams </em>(1997) 16 Cal.4th 153, 193 [66 Cal.Rptr.2d 123, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>940 P.2d 710]; <em>People v. Carter, supra, </em>30 Cal.4th at p. 1194 [evidence of a defendant\u2019s gang membership creates a risk the jury will improperly infer the defendant has a criminal disposition and is therefore guilty of the offense charged, and must be carefully scrutinized]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Gurule </em>(2002) 28 Cal.4th 557, 653 [123 Cal.Rptr.2d 345, 51 P.3d 224].)</p>\n<p id=\"b203-5\">A trial court\u2019s admission of evidence, including gang testimony, is reviewed for abuse of discretion. <em>(People v. Brown </em>(2003) 31 Cal.4th 518, 547 [3 Cal.Rptr.3d 145, 73 P.3d 1137]; <em>People v. Carter, supra, </em>30 Cal.4th at p. 1194; <em>People </em>v. <em>Waidla </em>(2000) 22 Cal.4th 690, 723 [94 Cal.Rptr.2d 396, 996 P.2d 46].) The trial court\u2019s ruling will not be disturbed in the absence of a showing it exercised its discretion in an arbitrary, capricious, or patently absurd manner that resulted in a miscarriage of justice. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Rodriguez </em>(1999) 20 Cal.4th 1, 9 [82 Cal.Rptr.2d 413, 971 P.2d 618].)</p>\n<p id=\"b203-6\">We agree with Avitia that the trial court abused its discretion by admitting the testimony that gang graffiti was observed on the posters. The crimes were not alleged to be gang related. No section 186.22 gang enhancement was alleged. The only theory upon which the evidence appears to have been admitted was that it tended to link the firearms with Avitia. But no such link was apparent from Deputy House\u2019s testimony. House did not testify about the nature or content of the gang graffiti on the posters. There was no showing that Avitia was named in the graffiti, either by his real name or a nickname of \u201cChivo.\u201d There was no showing any of the guns were referenced in the graffiti. There was, therefore, no evidentiary link between the gang graffiti and the ownership of the guns. The gang evidence was completely irrelevant to any issue at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-7\">Moreover, even if the evidence had somehow proved the guns belonged to Avitia, such evidence was unnecessary because it was offered on an undisputed issue. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Cardenas </em>(1982) 31 Cal.3d 897, 904-905 [184 Cal.Rptr. 165, 647 P.2d 569] [plur. opn.]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Maestas </em>(1993) 20 Cal.App.4th 1482, 1494-1495 [25 Cal.Rptr.2d 644].) The deputy testified that \u201cChivo\u201d was found on several of the seized items. According to the prosecutor, \u201cChivo\u201d was scratched on the butt of the AK-74; it would therefore have been observed by jurors. There was also testimony that \u201cChivo\u201d was tattooed on Avitia\u2019s hand, and he displayed his hand for the jury. The indisputable tattoo evidence could hardly have failed to link Avitia to the items found in his room bearing the same name. Further, Avitia offered to stipulate that the AK-74 was his. Given the strength of the tattoo evidence and the absence of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>dispute the weapons were Avitia\u2019s, admission of the graffiti evidence lacked any probative value. (See, e.g., <em>People </em>v. <em>Cardenas, supra, </em>at pp. 903-905 [admission of evidence that witnesses and defendant were members of the same gang was an abuse of discretion where other evidence had amply established the witnesses and defendant were friends and lived in the same neighborhood]; <em>People v. Maestas, supra, </em>at p. 1495.) \u201c \u2018[T]he prosecution has no right to present cumulative evidence which creates a substantial danger of undue prejudice to the defendant.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(People v. Cardenas, supra, </em>at p. 905.) Here, the only possible function of the gang evidence was to show Avitia\u2019s criminal disposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-5\">c. <em>Prejudice.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b204-6\">Thus, we turn to the question of prejudice. The erroneous admission of gang or other evidence requires reversal only if it is reasonably probable that appellant would have obtained a more favorable result had the evidence been excluded. (Evid. Code, \u00a7 353, subd. (b); <em>People v. Earp </em>(1999) 20 Cal.4th 826, 878 [85 Cal.Rptr.2d 857, 978 P.2d 15]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Jordan </em>(2003) 108 Cal.App.4th 349, 366 [133 Cal.Rptr.2d 434]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Bojorquez, supra, </em>104 Cal.App.4th at p. 345; <em>People v. Escobar </em>(1996) 48 Cal.App.4th 999, 1025 [55 Cal.Rptr.2d 883].) Here, the gang evidence was quite limited. Deputy House did not testify that Avitia was a gang member or associate, nor did he describe gang activities, culture, or crimes. Nonetheless, on the facts of this case, we conclude admission of the evidence was prejudicial in regard to count 1, grossly negligent discharge of a firearm.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The testimony that gang graffiti was found in Avitia\u2019s room clearly insinuated that Avitia was a gang member. House\u2019s recitation of his experience dealing with criminal street gangs, coming immediately after the testimony about the posters, cannot but have strengthened this impression. As Avitia argues, gangs are generally held in low regard among law-abiding citizens. It is common knowledge that gang members commit crimes, often with firearms. House\u2019s testimony that he had spoken with hundreds of gang members at the men\u2019s central jail emphasized that gang members frequently engage in criminal behavior. As we have noted, it is well-settled that evidence a defendant is a gang member may be highly inflammatory. (E.g., <em>People </em>v. <em>Gurule, supra, </em>28 Cal.4th at p. 653.)</p>\n<p id=\"b204-7\">Such was the case here. Evidence that Avitia was a gang member would have seriously undercut his defense. Avitia\u2019s account of events was not implausible. He claimed he was firing the pellet gun\u2014which was not alleged <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>to be a crime\u2014rather than the revolver. There was no dispute a pellet gun was found in his room. At least according to defense counsel\u2019s argument to the jury, the pellet gun resembled a revolver: \u201c[I]t looks very real.\u201d On the other hand, the People\u2019s case was not overwhelming. Even setting aside her transparently disingenuous trial testimony, Gaeta did not originally provide a great deal of detail to deputies, except to say the firearm was a handgun about as big as Avitia\u2019s hand. She testified, after her memory had purportedly been refreshed, that she was not familiar with handguns or pellet guns. This testimony was neither implausible nor inconsistent with her original statements to deputies, and tended to support Avitia\u2019s theory that she mistook the pellet gun for a handgun. The People presented no evidence that bullet holes, impact marks, or casings had been found in the backyard. Further, although the sound of gunfire had prompted Gaeta\u2019s 911 call, at the time she spoke with the operator Avitia was firing <em>without </em>bullets. No evidence was adduced to show that the reported \u201cdry firing\u201d was more consistent with use of a revolver than a pellet gun.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b205-5\">In sum, Avitia\u2019s credibility was key to the success of his defense. If his testimony was believed, he was a former small arms repairman in the United States Marine Corps and a gun hobbyist, who was simply conducting target practice with a pellet gun, an activity the People did not contend was unlawful.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Evidence Avitia was a gang member, on the other hand, suggested to the jury that he had a criminal disposition and was therefore guilty as charged <em>(People v. Carter, supra, </em>30 Cal.4th at p. 1194), that his story was probably false, and that his arsenal of guns, in the hands of a gang member, presented a special danger to the community. On the facts of this case, the erroneous admission of the evidence was prejudicial error on the grossly negligent discharge of a firearm count.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-6\">2., 3.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b206-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>DISPOSITION</p>\n<p id=\"b206-5\">The judgment is reversed as to count 1, grossly negligent discharge of a firearm, and affirmed on count 2, possession of an assault weapon.
