Miles, and Manette Wesley, who were classified employees assigned to the staff of the Personnel Commission of the Compton Community College District (Personnel Commission), sued the Compton Community College District (District) for constructive discharge and other employment-related claims. The District obtained summary judgment on the erroneous theory that the Personnel Commission, and not the District, was the plaintiffs\u2019 employer. The plaintiffs then sued the Personnel Commission, which obtained summary judgment on the theories that: (1) plaintiffs had failed to file a tort claim with the Personnel Commission pursuant to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"958\">*958</page-number>Government Code (Gov. Code, \u00a7 900 et seq.); and (2) plaintiffs had failed to exhaust their administrative remedies with regard to their claims against the Personnel Commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-4\">In the published portions of the opinion (all but parts II and III), we reverse the summary judgment for the District because under Education Code section 88084,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the District is the employer of the Personnel Commission\u2019s staff, who are classified employees of the <em>District. Given </em>our determination that plaintiffs are classified employees of the District, we dismiss plaintiffs\u2019 appeal from the summary judgment for the Personnel Commission as moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b830-6\">PLAINTIFFS\u2019 APPEAL FROM THE SUMMARY JUDGMENT FOR THE DISTRICT</p>\n<p id=\"b830-7\">A. <em>Background</em></p>\n<p id=\"b830-8\">The second amended complaint (the operative pleading with regard to the District\u2019s motion for summary judgment or, alternatively, summary adjudication) was directed solely against the District as plaintiffs\u2019 employer. The second amended complaint alleged causes of action against the District for: (1) constructive discharge in violation of public policy (first cause of action); (2) constructive discharge in retaliation for reporting a violation of public policy (second cause of action); (3) sex discrimination and harassment (fourth cause of action); and (4) intentional infliction of emotional distress (fifth cause of action).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b830-11\">The trial court granted the District\u2019s motion for summary judgment in its entirety and entered judgment for the District. On the first two causes of action for constructive discharge, the trial court held that the District was not plaintiffs\u2019 employer as a matter of l\u00e1w. The trial court concluded the District was not liable, as a matter of law, for constructive discharge because the Personnel Commission was plaintiffs\u2019 employer.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"959\">*959</page-number>On the fourth cause of action for sex discrimination/harassment, the trial court concluded that plaintiffs had failed to meet their burden under the burden-shifting procedure of Code of Civil Procedure section 437c, subdivision (p)(2).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In the District\u2019s words, the trial court granted summary adjudication on the sex discrimination/harassment claim because plaintiffs \u201cadmitted to not being sexually harassed and there was no evidence of disparate treatment by the DISTRICT.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b831-5\">Similarly, the trial court granted summary adjudication on the fifth cause of action for emotional distress after finding that plaintiffs had failed to meet their burden under the burden-shifting procedure of Code of Civil Procedure section 437c, subdivision (p)(2). According to the District, summary adjudication was granted on the emotional distress claim because plaintiffs \u201cdid not address that cause of action in their opposition and failed to raise a triable issue of material fact . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b831-6\">B. <em>Plaintiffs\u2019 Claims Against the District for Constructive Discharge</em></p>\n<p id=\"b831-7\">All three plaintiffs served on the Personnel Commission\u2019s staff; plaintiff Miles as director of classified personnel and secretary to the Personnel Commission; plaintiff Hood as the Personnel Commission\u2019s personnel analyst; and plaintiff Wesley as the Personnel Commission\u2019s senior secretary (confidential).</p>\n<p id=\"b831-8\">The trial court concluded that the District could not be held liable, as a matter of law, for constructive discharge because plaintiffs, as members of the Personnel Commission\u2019s staff, were employed by the Personnel Commission and not by the District. Section 88084, however, expressly provides that a personnel commission\u2019s staff shall \u201cbe <em>classified employees of the community college district </em>and shall be accorded all the rights, benefits, and burdens of any other classified employee serving in the regular service of the district, including representation by the appropriate exclusive representative, if any.\u201d (\u00a7 88084, italics added.) As we will discuss below, although a personnel commission has supervisory powers over its staff\u2019s commission-related activities (\u00a7 88084), its staff members are nonetheless \u201cclassified employees of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"960\">*960</page-number>community college district.\u201d (\u00a7 88084, italics added.) We conclude that under section 88084, the district is the employer of the Personnel Commission\u2019s staff.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-5\">1. <em>The Creation and Appointment of a Personnel Commission</em></p>\n<p id=\"b832-6\">When a community college district elects to adopt the merit system (see \u00a7 88050 et seq.), which is a form of civil service applicable to classified (noncertified) employees (\u00a7 88076),<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> the district must appoint a personnel commission of either three (as in this case) or five members (\u00a7\u00a7 88063-88066).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In the case of a three-member personnel commission, \u201c[o]ne member . . . shall be appointed by the governing board of the district and one member, nominated by the classified employees of the district, shall be appointed by the governing board of the district. Those two members shall, in turn, appoint the third member. . . .\u201d (\u00a7 88065.)</p>\n<p id=\"b832-7\">In this case, the Personnel Commission was comprised of three appointed members\u2014Kalem Aquil, F.C. Herbert, and May Thomas. One of the appointed commission members, Aquil, was named as an individual defendant in the original complaint but is no longer a party to the action.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-8\">Unlike the personnel commission\u2019s staff, who by law are designated as classified employees of the district (\u00a7 88084), the law provides that during their terms of service, members of the personnel commission (in this case, Aquil, Herbert, and Thomas) shall <em>not </em>be employees of the district, members <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"961\">*961</page-number>of the governing board,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> or members of the county board of education. (\u00a7 88064, subd. (b).) Members of the personnel commission receive compensation which is limited in smaller districts to $50 per meeting and $250 per month (\u00a7 88070), and in larger districts to $100 per meeting and $500 per month (\u00a7 88071).</p>\n<p id=\"b833-5\">2. <em>The Governing Board\u2019s Role Regarding the Personnel Commission and Classified Employees</em></p>\n<p id=\"b833-6\">By state law, the district\u2019s governing board must provide the personnel commission with office space (\u00a7 88072), and must include the personnel commission\u2019s budget (once it is approved by the county superintendent of schools) within the district\u2019s own budget (\u00a7 88073).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b833-7\">Pursuant to statute, the district\u2019s governing board sets and pays the compensation of classified employees, which by definition includes the staff of the personnel commission. (\u00a7\u00a7 88084, 88087, 88160.)<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> In determining the amount of compensation to be paid to classified employees, the governing board considers the personnel commission\u2019s salary recommendations, which the governing board may approve, amend, or reject. (\u00a7 88087.) The governing board also controls the leaves of absence, vacations, and sick leave taken by classified employees. (\u00a7\u00a7 88190, 88191.)</p>\n<p id=\"b833-8\">3. <em>Jurisdictional Roles of the District and the Commission in Disciplinary Matters Involving Classified Employees</em></p>\n<p id=\"b833-9\">The personnel commission writes procedural rules for the governing board to follow in matters including hiring, promotion, demotion, transfer, and dismissal of classified employees. (\u00a7\u00a7 88080, 88081.) Although disciplinary charges against classified employees are initiated by the commission\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"962\">*962</page-number>personnel director (\u00a7 88123), it is the governing board that decides those charges in the first instance. When the governing board suspends, demotes, or dismisses a permanent classified employee, the employee may appeal the governing board\u2019s decision to the personnel commission. (\u00a7 88124.) On appeal, the commission may sustain the employee and order reinstatement with backpay, or may modify (but not increase) the governing board\u2019s disciplinary action. (\u00a7 88126.) The governing board may not review the personnel commission\u2019s decision on appeal (\u00a7 88125), which is binding on the board (\u00a7 88126).</p>\n<p id=\"b834-4\">The different disciplinary roles assigned to the governing board and the personnel commission are jurisdictional in nature. A personnel commission that presumes to decide disciplinary charges against a classified employee <em>before </em>the governing board has ruled on the matter in the first instance will have acted in excess of its limited jurisdiction to review the governing board\u2019s disciplinary rulings. In <em>California Sch. Employees Assn. v. Personnel Commission </em>(1970) 3 Cal.3d 139 [89 Cal.Rptr. 620, 474 P.2d 436], which involved an analogous statutory scheme applicable to elementary and secondary education school districts and personnel commissions, the court stated, \u201cWe must conclude that District\u2019s board of trustees had exclusive jurisdiction to dismiss Mrs. Keidel, and that Commission\u2019s jurisdiction was appellate in nature and limited to reviewing prior board action. In the instant case, District\u2019s board resolved to dismiss Mrs. Keidel <em>after </em>Commission had announced its decision adjudging her dismissed from service. However, in the absence of a prior board dismissal, Commission lacked jurisdiction to act.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 144, fn. omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b834-5\">4. <em>The Limited Delegation to the Personnel Commission of Supervisory Powers Over Its Staff Employees</em></p>\n<p id=\"b834-6\">In general, the governing board has supervisory powers over all classified employees. Section 88009 states that \u201cGoverning boards shall fix and prescribe the duties to be performed by all persons in the classified service and other nonacademic positions of the community college district, except those persons employed as a part of a personnel commission staff . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b834-7\">Members of the personnel commission staff are to be supervised by the personnel commission when they are performing functions related to the functions of the commission. By law, the personnel commission appoints its own personnel director and other members of its own staff. (\u00a7 88084.) The personnel commission, and not the governing board, \u201cshall supervise the activities of those employees that are performed as a part of the functions of the commission.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>In this manner, the Legislature has carved a limited exception to the general rule that the governing board \u201cshall fix and prescribe the duties to be performed by all\u201d classified employees. (\u00a7 88009.)</p>\n<p id=\"b835-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"963\">*963</page-number>5. <em>Summary Judgment Should Not Have Been Granted on the Basis That Plaintiffs Were Not District Employees</em></p>\n<p id=\"b835-5\">The trial court granted the District\u2019s motion for summary adjudication on the constructive discharge cause of action based on its determination that plaintiffs were employed by the Personnel Commission and not by the District. This was erroneous as a matter of law. As stated above, section 88084 expressly provides that commission staff members are <em>\u201cclassified employees of the community college </em>district....\u201d (\u00a7 88084, italics added.) We conclude that plaintiffs, who all worked on the Personnel Commission staff, were classified employees of the District as a matter of law under section 88084, notwithstanding the Personnel Commission\u2019s limited supervisory powers over its staff.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-6\">Although the parties have cited no cases exactly on point, plaintiffs rely upon <em>United Public Employees v. Public Employment Relations Bd. </em>(1989) 213 Cal.App.3d 1119 [262 Cal.Rptr. 158] <em>(United Public Employees), </em>which they claim is analogous to this case, for the proposition that they were jointly employed by the District and the Personnel Commission. <em>United Public Employees </em>is distinguishable, however, because it involved a community college district whose boundaries were \u201cconterminous with the boundaries of a city and county[.]\u201d (\u00a7 88137; see <em>United Public Employees, supra, </em>213 Cal.App.3d at p. 1125.)<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Under section 88137, classified employees of such districts are governed by the city charter\u2019s provisions for a merit system of employment, \u201cprovided, however, that the governing board of the district shall have the right to fix the duties of all of its employees.\u201d (\u00a7 88137.) Construing the relevant statutes together, the court concluded in <em>United Public Employees </em>that the plaintiffs were jointly employed by the city and the district: \u201cThe general language of . . . sections 88000 and 88137 seems to mandate that San Francisco is the employer of these employees, while the proviso adds that the District can also be their employer.\u201d <em>(United Public Employees, supra, </em>213 Cal.App.3d at p. 1128.)</p>\n<p id=\"b835-7\">In this case, the District does not have boundaries coterminous with the boundaries of a city and county that provides in its charter a merit system for its classified employees. Moreover, the Personnel Commission in this case is not a municipal civil service commission, but is a three-member panel of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"964\">*964</page-number>appointees who receive limited compensation per meeting and per month. Accordingly, section 88137 does not apply to this case and we do not rely upon <em>United Public Employees </em>as authority for the proposition that plaintiffs are jointly employed by the District and the Personnel Commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-4\">While <em>United Public Employees </em>is, therefore, distinguishable, it is nevertheless helpful to our analysis on the topic of statutory construction. As explained in <em>United Public Employees, </em>in reading statutes \u201can overriding principle ... is that the individual portions of a statute should be harmonized with each other and the entire statute should be harmonized with the body of law of which it forms a part. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(United Public Employees, supra, </em>213 Cal.App.3d at p. 1127.) In this case, the individual portions of section 88084 should be harmonized with each other and with the body of law to which the statute belongs.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-5\">In one part, section 88084 states that the personnel commission \u201cshall supervise the activities of those employees that are performed as a part of the functions of the commission.\u201d (\u00a7 88084.) In another part, section 88084, in referring to the employees on the personnel commission\u2019s staff, states that \u201c[t]hese employees shall be ... classified employees of the community college district and shall be accorded all the rights, benefits, and burdens of any other classified employee serving in the regular service of the district. . . .\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b836-6\">In this case, the trial court\u2019s legal determination\u2014that the District does not employ the Personnel Commission\u2019s staff\u2014is erroneous because it effectively negates and renders superfluous section 88084\u2019s pronouncement that the personnel commission\u2019s staff are classified employees of the community college district, and are entitled to all the rights, benefits, and burdens of any other classified employee. By negating those portions of section 88084, the trial court violated the statutory rule of construction \u201c \u2018that effect be given, if possible to every word, clause and sentence. [Citation.] [The trial court also violated the] corollary, [that] a statute should be construed so that effect is given to all its provisions, leaving no part superfluous or inoperative, void or insignificant and so that one section will not destroy another.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(United Public Employees, supra, </em>213 Cal.App.3d at p. 1127.)</p>\n<p id=\"b836-7\">\u201c \u2018 \u201c \u2018It is a settled rule of statutory construction that where a statute, with reference to one subject contains a given provision, the omission of such provision from a similar statute concerning a related subject is significant to show that a different legislative intent existed with reference to the different statutes.\u2019 \u201d \u2019 <em>(In re Marriage of Corman </em>(1997) 59 Cal.App.4th 1492, 1499 [69 Cal.Rptr.2d 880], quoting <em>In re Jose A. </em>(1992) 5 Cal.App.4th 697, 701-702 [7 Cal.Rptr.2d 44].)\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Franz </em>(2001) 88 Cal.App.4th 1426, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"965\">*965</page-number>1440 [106 Cal.Rptr.2d 773].) Had the Legislature intended to preclude employees on the personnel commission\u2019s staff from being classified employees of the district, it knew how to do so. In section 88064, subdivision (b), for example, the Legislature expressly said that members of the personnel commission shall not be employees of the district. In section 88084, on the other hand, the Legislature expressly said that employees on the personnel commission\u2019s staff shall be classified employees of the district.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-5\">The District\u2019s reliance upon <em>Personnel Com. </em>v. <em>Board of Education </em>(1990) 223 Cal.App.3d 1463 [273 Cal.Rptr. 288] <em>(Lynwood), </em>is misplaced. In <em>Lynwood, </em>a school district\u2019s personnel commission petitioned for a writ of mandate to overturn the governing board\u2019s decision to reduce the position of the personnel commission\u2019s personnel director from full-time to half-time. Citing section 45109, which, like section 88009, delegates limited supervisory powers to the personnel commission over its staff members, the <em>Lynwood </em>court concluded \u201cthat the Board lacks authority to alter the workweek of the personnel director . . . .\u201d <em>(Lynwood, supra, </em>223 Cal.App.3d at p. 1468.)</p>\n<p id=\"b837-6\">We distinguish <em>Lynwood, </em>however, because it did not address the issue which is before us, namely, whether a personnel commission\u2019s staff members are classified employees of the district. Having failed to address that issue, <em>Lynwood </em>is not relevant to our decision in this case. \u201c \u2018Fundamentally, a decision is not authority for a proposition it does not consider and resolve.\u2019 <em>(Ellis </em>v. <em>McKinnon Broadcasting Co. </em>(1993) 18 Cal.App.4th 1796, 1806 [23 Cal.Rptr.2d 80].)\u201d <em>(Personnel Com. </em>v. <em>Barstow Unified School Dist. </em>(1996) 43 Cal.App.4th 871, 881 [50 Cal.Rptr.2d 797] <em>(Barstow).)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b837-7\">In addition, the overall validity of the <em>Lynwood </em>decision was called into question in <em>Barstow, </em>which held that personnel commissions lack standing to sue, which was another point not addressed in <em>Lynwood. </em>(See <em>Barstow, supra, </em>43 Cal.App.4th at p. 879 [\u201cThe merit system statutes contain no general provision authorizing a personnel commission to sue, nor do they include any specific provision authorizing a commission to take legal action to challenge decisions of the district concerning the employment of classified employees or the contracting out of work.\u201d].) Under <em>Barstow\u2019s </em>analysis of standing, the personnel commission\u2019s writ of mandate petition against the district in <em>Lynwood </em>should have been dismissed for lack of standing. While section 72000, subdivision (a) provides that \u201c[t]he district and its governing board may sue and be sued,\u201d there is no similar provision authorizing the personnel commission to sue and be sued. The statutory omission was, we believe, intentional. (See <em>People v. Franz, supra, </em>88 Cal.App.4th at p. 1440.)</p>\n<p id=\"b837-8\">Had <em>Barstow </em>limited its discussion of <em>Lynwood </em>to the issue of a personnel commission\u2019s lack of standing to sue the district, we would have no quarrel <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"966\">*966</page-number>with its analysis. <em>Barstow </em>went on, however, to remark that <em>Lynwood </em>involved a personnel commission\u2019s staff member who was employed by the personnel commission, whereas <em>Barstow </em>involved transportation employees who were employed by <em>the </em>district. Elaborating on this supposed distinction between employers, <em>Barstow </em>stated, in dicta, that <em>Lynwood </em>\u201cstands at most for the proposition that a personnel commission properly may litigate matters relating to the employment of its own employees. Because the personnel director in that case was an employee of the commission, the board\u2019s action in reducing his level of service directly affected the commission\u2019s interests. In the present case, the transportation employees who were laid off were employees of the District, not the Commission.\u201d <em>(Barstow, supra, </em>43 Cal.App.4th at p. 881.)</p>\n<p id=\"b838-4\">We believe <em>Barstow </em>went too far in assuming, without benefit of any analysis, that personnel commission staff members are employees of the personnel commission and not of the district. <em>Barstow </em>ignored the fact that section 45264 (which applies to elementary and secondary school districts and is similar to section 88084) states that members of a personnel commission\u2019s staff shall be classified employees of the school <em>district. Barstow </em>also ignored the fact that <em>Lynwood </em>neither considered nor decided whether personnel commission staff members are employed by the commission or by the district. <em>Lynwood </em>said nothing on <em>that point </em>and, in our view, <em>Barstow </em>erroneously distinguished <em>Lynwood </em>on the basis of an issue neither considered nor resolved in <em>Lynwood.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b838-5\">Other than <em>United Public Employees, </em>which we distinguished earlier, we are aware of no published decision that has considered whether the staff members of a community college district\u2019s personnel commission are employees of the district or of the personnel commission. The lack of cases on point is less significant, however, given that section 88084 conclusively establishes that members of a personnel commission\u2019s staff are classified employees of the district. Nothing in the cases cited by the District compels us to reach any other conclusion. While the District relies heavily upon plaintiffs\u2019 deposition testimony regarding their states of mind as to whether they were employed by the District or by the Personnel Commission, such testimony is irrelevant (as well as inconclusive) due to the legal pronouncement in section 88084 that employees of the personnel commission\u2019s staff are, by definition, classified employees of the district.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"967\">*967</page-number>Based on our legal determination that plaintiffs were classified employees of the District under section 88084, we conclude the District was not entitled to summary adjudication on the constructive discharge causes of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-5\">C. <em>Plaintiffs\u2019 Sex Discrimination/Harassment Claim Against the District</em></p>\n<p id=\"b839-6\">According to the District, the trial court granted summary adjudication on the sex discrimination/harassment claim because plaintiffs \u201cadmitted to not being sexually harassed and there was no evidence of disparate treatment by the DISTRICT.\u201d While the record contains no written explanation for the trial court\u2019s ruling, the reporter\u2019s transcript contains the following oral explanation: \u201cAs to the fourth cause of action for sexual harassment, the facts are that the [District] is not the employer of the plaintiff. When plaintiff admits to not being sexually harassed, but being treated disparately, the statement is not supported by the facts or the evidence and, as such, Compton Community College District has met its initial burden, [f] Plaintiff has failed to raise a triable issue of material fact, and the motion for summary adjudication [of] issues is granted as to Compton Community College District.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b839-7\">As we have discussed above, the trial court erred as a matter of law in concluding the District was not plaintiffs\u2019 employer. The remainder of the trial court\u2019s oral ruling, in our view, falls short of Code of Civil Procedure section 437c, subdivision (g)\u2019s requirement that \u201c. . . [u]pon the grant of a motion for summary judgment, on the ground that there is no triable issue of material fact, the court shall, by written or oral order, specify the reasons for its determination. The order shall specifically refer to the evidence proffered in support of, and if applicable in opposition to, the motion which indicates that no triable issue exists. The court shall also state its reasons for any other determination. The court shall record its determination by court reporter or written order.\u201d (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 437c, subd. (g).)</p>\n<p id=\"b839-8\">In their opening brief, plaintiffs recount numerous incidents (with citations to declarations submitted in opposition to the motion below) of alleged sexual harassment and discrimination. Accordingly, the record is at odds with the trial court\u2019s statement that plaintiffs admitted to not being sexually harassed. In addition, the District in its respondent\u2019s brief fails to defend the trial court\u2019s summary adjudication of the sex discrimination/harassment claim on any basis other than the erroneous determination that the District was not the plaintiffs\u2019 employer.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-9\">Given the conflict between the record and the trial court\u2019s explanation for its ruling, the trial court\u2019s erroneous determination that the District was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"968\">*968</page-number>not plaintiffs\u2019 employer, and the lack of any evidentiary support for the trial court\u2019s ruling, we are compelled to conclude the trial court erred as a matter of law in granting summary adjudication on the sex discrimination/harassment claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-4\">D. <em>Plaintiffs\u2019 Emotional Distress Claim Against the District</em></p>\n<p id=\"b840-5\">For reasons similar to those stated above, we conclude the trial court erred as a matter of law in granting summary adjudication on the intentional infliction of emotional distress claim. Again, the record contains no written explanation of the trial court\u2019s ruling. In its oral statement, the trial court stated: \u201cAs to the fifth cause of action for intentional infliction of emotional distress, the plaintiffs did not address that cause of action in their paper and, with a lack of employment relationship, that cause of action\u2014the defense, Compton Community College District, has met its initial burden and plaintiffs have failed to raise a triable issue of material fact. Summary adjudication is granted as to the fifth cause of action.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b840-6\">Again, the record is at odds with the trial court\u2019s explanation. In their opposition to the District\u2019s separate statement of undisputed facts, plaintiffs contended they \u201cwere subjected] to extreme and outrageous conduct which caused them severe emotional distress\u201d and cited to exhibits and declarations that support their contention. In addition, the District\u2019s respondent\u2019s brief fails to defend the trial court\u2019s summary adjudication of the emotional distress claim on any basis other than the erroneous determination that the District was not the plaintiffs\u2019 employer.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-7\">Given the conflict between the record and the trial court\u2019s explanation for its ruling, the trial court\u2019s erroneous determination that the District was not plaintiffs\u2019 employer, and the lack of any evidentiary support for the trial court\u2019s ruling, we are compelled to conclude the trial court erred as a matter of law in granting summary adjudication on the emotional distress claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-8\">II, III<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b841-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"969\">*969</page-number>IV</p>\n<p id=\"b841-5\">DISPOSITION</p>\n<p id=\"b841-6\">On plaintiffs\u2019 appeal from the summary judgment in favor of the District, we reverse the summary judgment and award plaintiffs their costs.
