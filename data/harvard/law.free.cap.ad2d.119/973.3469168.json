We find no error with respect to the trial court\u2019s instructions to the jury. We conclude, however, that the defendant may have been improperly adjudicated a second felony offender.</p>\n<p id=\"b1003-7\">Prior to defendant\u2019s sentencing, the District Attorney filed a second felony offender statement pursuant to CPL 400.21 alleging that defendant had previously been convicted of a felony. Defendant controverted the validity of his prior felony conviction by alleging that he was denied the effective assistance of counsel based upon his attorney\u2019s failure to advise him as to all the elements of the crime to which he was pleading. The sentencing court denied defendant\u2019s challenge to the prior conviction without conducting a hearing. \"A challenge to a plea based on an insufficient factual recitation is to be distinguished from a challenge based on constitutional grounds, which may be sustained even if raised for the first time at a second felony offender hearing\u201d <em>(People v Perkins, </em>89 AD2d 956; CPL 400.21 [7] [b]; <em>cf. People v Grimes, </em>94 AD2d 957). Here, defendant\u2019s moving papers clearly raise a claim that his prior felony conviction was unconstitutionally ob<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"974\">*974</page-number>tained because he was denied the effective assistance of counsel. Thus, the sentencing court\u2019s refusal to conduct a hearing on defendant\u2019s claim before sentencing him as a second felony offender was improper <em>(People v James, </em>109 AD2d 1095) as it prevented exploration of the circumstances of defendant\u2019s prior representation <em>(see, People v Baldi, </em>54 NY2d 137, 146; <em>People v James, supra). </em>Therefore, a hearing is required prior to imposition of sentence. Present. \u2014 Callahan, J. P., Doerr, Denman, Boomer and O\u2019Donnell, JJ.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
