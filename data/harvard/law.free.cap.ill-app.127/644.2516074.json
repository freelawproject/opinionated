'</p> <p id=\"b667-11\" pgmap=\"667\">To Exhibits 11, 12 and 13 the court appears to have sustained the objection of defendant upon the ground that they did not show a judgment of the Court of Appeals in favor of appellant and against appellee in that court for appellant\u2019s costs in that court, nor the amount of such costs.</p> <p id=\"b667-12\" pgmap=\"667\">We think the judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals that \u201cthe decree of the Circuit Court in this cause be reversed with costs and the cause remanded to the Circuit Court with directions to dismiss the bill,\u201d was a judgment in favor of appellant and against appellee for appellant\u2019s costs in said cause in said Court of Appeals. State ex rel. Boye, 18 La. Ann. 102.</p> <p id=\"b667-13\" pgmap=\"667\">The plaintiff put in evidence a certified copy of Rule 31 of said Circuit Court of Appeals, which provides that: \u201cIn case of the reversal of any judgment or decree by this court, costs shall be allowed the plaintiff in error or appellant, including the costs of the transcript from the court below, unless otherwise ordered by the court.\u201d The same rule provides that, \u201cWhere costs are allowed in this court, it shall be the duty of the clerk to insert the amount thereof in the body of the mandate, or other proper process sent to the court below, and annex to the same bill of items taxed in detail.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b667-14\" pgmap=\"667(9) 668(120)\">An execution does not issue from the United States Circuit Court of Appeals to collect a judgment for costs of that court, but issues from the Circuit Court/ upon the filing of the mandate with a statement of such costs and a bill of items of such costs. The plaintiff put in evidence a certified copy of the entries in the Judgment Debtor Docket of the Circuit Court, showing that February 21, 1901, there was issued, \u201cExecution against.DeWitt Clinton Prescott for the sum of $1,306.10, costs taxed in mandate of U. S. Circuit Court of Appeals filed and entered herein July 5, 1901, together with the sum of $145.45 costs taxed in decree of dismissal entered July 5, 1900, and $2.80 accruing costs,\u201d which execution was returned unsatisfied.</p> <p id=\"b668-5\" pgmap=\"668\">The law made it the duty of the clerk of the Circuit Court of Appeals to tax the costs of appellant in that court. In Parisher v. Waldo, 72 Ill. 72, it was said: \u201cWhen the fee bill is made up by the proper officer, it must be regarded as prima facie correct. * * * The judgment debtor must challenge the illegal costs * * * in some direct proceeding instituted for that purpose. It will be found impracticable to do it in an action on an appeal bond\u2014it presents a collateral issue.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b668-9\" pgmap=\"668\">We think the transcripts offered and excluded showed not only a judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals against appellee (defendant here) for appellant\u2019s costs in that court, but also the amount of such costs, and that the court erred in excluding such transcripts.</p> <p id=\"b668-11\" pgmap=\"668\">As to the decree of the Circuit Court, there is no question but that the decree for costs was against the complainant\u2014defendant here\u2014for a definite sum, for that decree was that the bill be dismissed \u201cand that respondent recover from complainant its costs in this behalf expended, taxed to $145.45,\u201d and the court erred in excluding the exemplified copy of that decree. The action was upon two judgments for costs only, one of the United States Circuit Court of Appeals, the other of the Circuit Court of the United States, and we do not think that in such an action it was necessary to produce the entire record of either-court.</p> <p id=\"A4J\" pgmap=\"669\">\u201cThere has been some conflict of opinion as to whether it was or was not necessary to produce the entire record of a sister state judgment. But the true distinction seems to be well stated in a recent North Carolina case in which the court considered that if a judgment of a sister state is relied upon to establish any particular state of facts upon which the judgment was based or as a matter of estoppel, then a duly authenticated copy of the proceedings in which the judgment was rendered ought to be introduced, but in cases where it is only sought to prove the contents and existence of a judgment, it is only necessary to produce a duly authenticated copy of the judgment itself.\u201d 13 En. &amp; Am. Ency. of Law, 2nd Ed., 1346; Rainey v. Hines, 121 N. C. 318; Little Rock Cooperage Co. v. Hodge, 112 Ga. 521; Gibson v. Robinson, 90 id. 756.</p> <p id=\"b669-8\" pgmap=\"669\">Here there was much more than the copy of the judgment and decree. There were copies of the subpoena, bill, answer of the appellant here, decree of Circuit Court for complainant, petition for appeal, order allowing the appeal, appeal bond, citation, assignment of errors, judgment of reversal of the Circuit Court of Appeals, bill of the costs of appellant in that court and taxation of same, mandate and decree of the Circuit Court dismissing bill and for defendant\u2019s costs in that court against complainant.</p> <p id=\"b669-9\" pgmap=\"669(138) 670(69)\">A complete transcript of the record of the proceedings in the Circuit Court would have included also a copy of the proofs taken in that court, and a complete transcript of the record of the proceedings of the Circuit Court of Appeals would have included also the copy of the proofs taken in the Circuit Court contained in the transcript filed in the Circuit Court of Appeals. When, as in this case, the judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals was offered only to prove the.existence of a judgment of that court for costs in favor of the plaintiff and against the defendant in this suit and the amount of such costs, no reason is perceived for incorporating into the transcript of the record of such judgment a copy of the copy of the proofs contai ned in the transcript filed in that court, nor for incorporating into the transcript of the record of the decree of the Circuit Court for the defendant\u2019s costs in that court against complainant a copy of the proofs taken in that court, where such transcript was offered only to prove the existence of such decree against complainant for defendant\u2019s costs and the amount of such costs.</p> <p id=\"b670-4\" pgmap=\"670\">The record of papers, entries and records of the courts of the United States offered in evidence were all certified in the manner provided by the statute of this state and were admissible, although not certified in accordance with the Act of Congress. Garden City Sand Co. v. Miller, 157 Ill. 225.</p> <p id=\"b670-5\" pgmap=\"670\">The judgment of the Superior Court will be reversed and the cause remanded.</p> <p id=\"b670-6\" pgmap=\"670\">Reversed and remanded.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
