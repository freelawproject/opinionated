McAuliffe regarding his alleged efforts to reserve the name \u201cThe Fairfield Leader\u201d with the Secretary of State. The motion is granted. Also before us is a joint motion for a protective order filed by David L. Landefeld and Paul D. More-hart. Landefeld\u2019s motion is granted. Morehart\u2019s motion is denied insofar as it relates to his knowledge of the allegations about McAuliffe. It is granted in all other respects.</p>\n<judges id=\"b239-17\">Moyer, C.J., Holmes, Wright, H.

More-hart, I would deny the joint motion for a protective order as to both movants. There is something amiss in this case and the tool we use in our profession to ferret out such problems is called discovery. I would allow relator\u2019s discovery attempts to proceed in all respects.</p>\n<judges id=\"b239-21\">Sweeney, J., concurs in the foregoing opinion.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
