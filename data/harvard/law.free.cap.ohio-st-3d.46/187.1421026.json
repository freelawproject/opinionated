Since the issue was considered on a motion to dismiss under Civ. R. 12(B)(6), we necessarily construe the facts in appellant\u2019s complaint as true. <em>Mitchell </em>v. <em>Lawson Milk Co. </em>(1988), 40 Ohio St. 3d 190, 192, 532 N.E. 2d 753, 756. Therefore, appellee concedes using the guidelines to review appellant\u2019s case, but does not concede that the guidelines are unconstitutional or an abuse of discretion, since legal conclusions are not admitted by a motion to dismiss. <em>Id. </em>at 193, 532 N.E. 2d at 756.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-10\">In <em>State, ex rel. Blake, </em>v. <em>Shoemaker </em>(1983), 4 Ohio St. 3d 42, 4 OBR 86, 446 N.E. 2d 169, we held that R.C. 2967.03, the parole statute, provides no expectancy of parole. Therefore, at most, appellant could have proved that the guidelines were unconstitutional or unconstitutionally applied, but such a showing would not have entitled him to a rehearing at any specific time or under any specific guidelines. Moreover, we hold that declaratory judgment is an adequate remedy at law in this case, as it would have afforded a complete remedy in determining the constitutionality or constitutional application of the guidelines. See <em>State, ex rel. Fenske, </em>v. <em>McGovern </em>(1984), 11 Ohio St. 3d 129, 11 OBR 426, 464 N.E. 2d 525, paragraph two of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-11\">Accordingly, the judgment of the court of appeals is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-12\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b226-13\">Moyer, C.J., Sweeney, Holmes, Douglas, Wright, H.
