We disagree and hold that, under R.C. 5717.01, an appellant must timely file notices of appeal with the BTA and with the board of revision. If they are not so filed, the BTA does not obtain jurisdiction to hear the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-13\"><em>In Bd,. of Edn. of Mentor Exempted Village School Dist. </em>v. <em>Bd. of Revision of Lake Cty. </em>(1980), 61 Ohio St. 2d 332, 15 O.O. 3d 398, 401 N.E. 2d 435, we held that timely filing of the notice with the Commissioner of Tax Equalization (no longer statutorily required) was jurisdictional. We disregarded the commissioner\u2019s virtual waiver of notice. We compared R.C. 5717.01 with R.C. 5717.02 (providing for appeals from the Tax Commissioner) and ruled that both statutes contained specific requirements \u201c* * * couched in terms that are mandatory.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 334, 15 O.O. 3d at 399, 401 N.E. 2d at 436.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-14\">In <em>Consolidated Freightways, Inc. </em>v. <em>Summit Cty. Bd. of Revision </em>(1986), 21 Ohio St. 3d 17, 21 OBR 279, 487 N.E. 2d 298, while reversing a BTA dismissal of a notice of appeal on evidentiary grounds, we concluded our opinion by emphasizing that we would continue to hold litigants to the mandatory notice-of-appeal requirements of R.C. 5717.01. We reaffirm those holdings today.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-15\">As for appellants\u2019 argument that they have substantially complied with the filing requirements, <em>Akron Standard Div. </em>v. <em>Lindley </em>(1984), 11 Ohio St. 3d 10, 11 OBR 9, 462 N.E. 2d 419, held that the verification requirement for a sales and use tax reassessment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>petition was non-jurisdictional. We distinguished the verification requirement from the timely filing requirement. We regarded the latter requirement to be essential because it ran to the core of procedural efficiency. \u201cThe thirty-day requirement is an appellate statute of limitations * * *. Failure to comply fully with * * * [it] properly leads to dismissal of the appeal, since substantial compliance has not occurred.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 12, 11 OBR at 10, 462 N.E. 2d at 420. The verification requirement, on the other hand, had no such essential purpose and was, therefore, not jurisdictional.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-5\">In the instant case, timely filing a copy of the notice of appeal with the board provides that agency with statutory notice of the appeal. According to R.C. 5717.01, after receipt of this notice the board must notify all parties of the appeal and transmit to the BTA a transcript of the board\u2019s proceedings, including all evidence received by the board. Thus, under <em>Akron Standard Div., </em>the filing requirement runs to the core of procedural efficiency and is essential to the proceeding. Appellants, thus, have not substantially complied with the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-6\">Furthermore, the cases decided since <em>Akron Standard Div. </em>cited by appellants considered the contents of a notice of appeal and not its timely filing. <em>Mullins </em>v. <em>Whiteway Mfg. Co. </em>(1984), 15 Ohio St. 3d 18, 15 OBR 15, 471 N.E. 2d 1383 (failure to include the date of decision appealed from in the notice of appeal under R.C. 4123.519 was not a jurisdictional defect), <em>Wells </em>v. <em>Chrysler </em>(1984), 15 Ohio St. 3d 21, 15 OBR 18, 472 N.E. 2d 331 (including the name of the employer only in the caption of the notice of appeal and not designating the employer as appellee were not jurisdictional defects), and <em>Fisher </em>v. <em>Mayfield </em>(1987), 30 Ohio St. 3d 8, 30 OBR 16, 505 N.E. 2d 975 (misstating the agency from which the appeal was taken and the date of its decision was not a jurisdictional defect) do not support appellants\u2019 position. Moreover, R.C. 4123.519, the statute reviewed in these cases, must be construed liberally in favor of employees and dependents of deceased employees under R.C. 4123.95. See <em>Mullins, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b232-8\">Further, the BTA\u2019s docketing letters do not replace appellants\u2019 duty to file their notices of appeal with the board. In <em>Clippard Instrument Laboratory, Inc. </em>v. <em>Lindley </em>(1977), 50 Ohio St. 2d 121, 4 O.O. 3d 279, 363 N.E. 2d 592, we held that filing a copy of the notice of appeal with the commissioner under R.C. 5717.02 was required despite the BTA\u2019s notifying the commissioner of the appeal by a letter. We apply that holding to this case. The BTA, evidently pursuing procedural efficiency, undertook to notify the board here. However, the BTA has no statutory duty to inform a board of revision that an appeal has been filed. The statute burdens appellants with this duty. Appellants may not substitute the BTA\u2019s voluntary deeds for their required acts.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-9\">A notice of appeal, furthermore, gives more information than does the BTA\u2019s docketing letter. The notice describes the property under appeal and lists its taxing district, which could be different from information contained in the complaint initially filed with the board. For example, an appellant could appeal as to only a portion of the property first included in the complaint. The notice also reveals an appellant\u2019s current claim of fair market value, which could be different from the value stated in the initial complaint or that supported by the evidence before the board. The difference <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>could lead to settlement of the appeal prior to the BTA hearing. Thus, good reasons exist for the statutory design requiring an appellant to file a timely notice of appeal with the board of revision.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-4\">Accordingly, we find the BTA\u2019s decision in each case to be reasonable and lawful and affirm them.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-6\">\n<em>Decisions affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b233-7\">Moyer, C.J., Sweeney, Holmes, Douglas, Wright, H.
