We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-18\">A political subdivision of a state is embraced within the meaning of the word \u201cperson\u201d by a statute such as R.C. 119.01(F) defining \u201cperson\u201d as including a corporation, association or partnership. See <em>Ohio </em>v. <em>Helvering </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>(1934), 292 U.S. 360, 370. A body corporate and politic is a governmental body or public corporation having powers and duties of government. <em>Uricich </em>v. <em>Kolesar </em>(1936), 132 Ohio St. 115, 118, 7 O.O. 222, 223, 5 N.E. 2d 335, 337; <em>Utah State Bldg. Comm. </em>v. <em>Great American Indemn. Co. </em>(1943), 105 Utah 11, 140 P. 2d 763. Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (5 Ed. 1979) 307, defines \u201cpublic corporation\u201d as \u201c* * * one created by the state for political purposes and to act as an agency in the administration of civil government, generally within a particular territory or subdivision of the state, and usually invested, for that purpose, with subordinate and local powers of legislation; such as a county, city, town, or school district.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b188-4\">As we indicated in <em>Uricich, supra, </em>at 118-119, 7 O.O. at 223, 5 N.E. 2d at 337, the word \u201cperson\u201d has been applied to counties which are bodies corporate and politic. Thus, an entity qualifying as a body corporate and politic is a \u201cperson\u201d as defined in R.C. 119.01(F).</p>\n<p id=\"b188-5\">MRDD, as a governmental unit of Hamilton County, is a body corporate and politic and comes within the R.C. 119.01(F) definition of \u201cperson.\u201d Thus, it is a party within the meaning of R.C. 119.12. <em>Staples </em>v. <em>Ohio Civ. Serv. Emp. Assn./American Fed. of State, Cty. &amp; Mun. Emp., Local 11, AFL-CIO </em>(1986), 32 Ohio App. 3d 9, 513 N.E. 2d 821.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-6\">This court has previously entertained appeals from various state board decisions by local county boards such as MRDD. We have recognized that such appeals may be brought under R.C. 119.12 if the proceedings of the state administrative agency are quasi-judicial in nature. <em>State, ex rel. Bd. of Edn., </em>v. <em>State Bd. of Edn. </em>(1978), 53 Ohio St. 2d 173, 176-177, 7 O.O. 3d 357, 358, 373 N.E. 2d 1238, 1241. In <em>State, ex rel. Bell, </em>v. <em>Cambridge Bd. of Edn. </em>(1976), 45 Ohio St. 2d 316, 318, 74 O.O. 2d 475, 476, 345 N.E. 2d 57, 58, we indicated that the failure of a local school board to avail itself of \u201cits right to appeal the state board\u2019s decision, pursuant to R.C. 119.12 * * *\u201d was grounds for denial of the local school board\u2019s petition for a writ of mandamus.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-10\">We thus have recognized, albeit <em>sub silentio, </em>that local county boards such as MRDD are \u201cpersons\u201d within the meaning of the R.C. 119.12 appeal provision. This view is reinforced by the recently enacted R.C. 4117.01(A),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> wherein the General Assembly clearly defined \u201cperson\u201d to include a political subdivision.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-11\">SERB and the union contend that our decisions in <em>State, ex rel. Osborn, </em>v. <em>Jackson </em>(1976), 46 Ohio St. 2d 41, 75 O.O. 2d 132, 346 N.E. 2d 141, and <em>Thaxton </em>v. <em>Medina City Bd. of Edn. </em>(1986), 21 Ohio St. 3d 56, 21 OBR 357, 488 N.E. 2d 136, require that we hold that MRDD is not a \u201cperson\u201d within the meaning of R.C. Chapter 119.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-12\">In <em>Osborn, supra, </em>we held that \u201c[t]he director of a state department does not have a right of appeal to the Court of Common Pleas of Franklin County from an order of the State Personnel Board of Review disaffirming the director\u2019s layoff order of an employee for alleged lack of work. (R.C. 119.01 and 119.12.) <em>(Corn </em>v. <em>Bd. of Liquor Control </em>[1953], 160 Ohio St. <em>9 * * </em>*.)\u201d <em>Id. </em>at paragraph three of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>syllabus. Our decision in <em>Osborn, supra, </em>addresses the right of the director of a state agency to bring an appeal under R.C. Chapter 119 and does not apply here.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-4\">Nor is our decision in <em>Thaxton, supra, </em>inconsistent with our determination that MRDD is a \u201cperson.\u201d We held in <em>Thaxton </em>that \u201c[a] public board of education is not a \u2018person,\u2019 as defined in R.C. 1331.01(A), when the board operates within its clear legal authority.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at syllabus. R.C. 1331.01(A)\u2019s definition of \u201cperson\u201d applies specifically to the Valentine Act, dealing with monopolies, and is inapplicable here.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-5\">For the foregoing reasons, we hold that a county board of mental retardation and developmental disabilities is a \u201cperson\u201d entitled to appeal an order of the State Employment Relations Board pursuant to R.C. 119.12.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b189-7\">The second issue requires us to determine whether SERB\u2019S access, solicitation, and distribution rules for the rerun election were improperly promulgated because they were adopted in an adjudication process rather than pursuant to SERB\u2019S R.C. 119.03 rule-making authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-8\">R.C. 119.01(D) defines \u201cadjudication\u201d as \u201cthe determination by the highest or ultimate authority of an agency of the rights, duties, privileges, benefits, or legal relationships of a specified person, but does not include * * * acts of a ministerial nature.\u201d The parties do not dispute that SERB\u2019S access, solicitation and distribution rules for the rerun election were issued pursuant to an adjudication. (See, also, our analysis in Part III.)</p>\n<p id=\"b189-9\">We have consistently held that the decision whether to proceed by rule making or adjudication to resolve a dispute lies primarily in the informed discretion of the administrative agency. <em>Duff Truck Line, Inc. </em>v. <em>Pub. Util. Comm. </em>(1976), 46 Ohio St. 2d 186, 193, 75 O.O. 2d 229, 233, 348 N.E. 2d 127, 131; <em>Cleveland Freight Lines, Inc. </em>v. <em>Pub. Util. Comm. </em>(1980), 62 Ohio St. 2d 50, 53, 16 O.O. 3d 38, 40, 402 N.E. 2d 1192, 1195; <em>Blue Cross of Northeast Ohio </em>v. <em>Ratchford </em>(1980), 64 Ohio St. 2d 256, 262, 18 O.O. 3d 450, 454, 416 N.E. 2d 614, 619; see, also, <em>Columbia Broadcasting System, Inc. </em>v. <em>United States </em>(1942), 316 U.S. 407, 421; <em>Natl. Labor Relations Bd. </em>v. <em>Beech-Nut Life Savers, Ine. </em>(C.A. 2, 1968), 406 F. 2d 253.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-11\">An administrative board has the authority to use either quasi-legislative promulgation of general rules designed to address a general issue or to use a quasi-judicial proceeding when a specific dispute arises as a case before the board. <em>Id. </em>at 257. \u201cTo insist upon one form of action to the exclusion of the other is to exalt form over necessity.\u201d <em>Securities &amp; Exchange Comm. </em>v. <em>Chenery Corp. </em>(1947), 332 U.S. 194, 202.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-12\">Here, it was within SERB\u2019S discretion to promulgate the rerun election access, solicitation and distribution rules in an adjudication process.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-13\">SERB\u2019S decision to resolve, by adjudication, the issues presented by the parties in this case is an administrative judgment entitled to deference by appellate courts. The decision is the product of administrative experience, appreciation of the complexities of the problem, realization of the statutory policies and responsible treatment of the facts. It is the type of judgment which administrative agencies are best equipped to make and for which the administrative process is most appropriate. See <em>Republic Aviation Corp. </em>v. <em>Natl. Labor Relations Bd. </em>(1945), 324 U.S. 793, 800. It is a judgment we should not disturb.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b190-4\">We next consider whether SERB\u2019S order setting aside the election results and ordering a rerun election is a final appealable order.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-5\">MRDD contends that the adjudication language of R.C. 119.12 embraces the \u201cconcept of finality\u201d and that the \u201cfinal order\u201d provision of R.C. 2505.02 is inapplicable to R.C. Chapter 119 proceedings. The implication is that all SERB adjudication orders, whether final or not, are subject to judicial review pursuant to R.C. 119.12. We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-6\">A litigant has only a statutory, not an inherent, right to appeal a SERB adjudication. See R.C. 119.12. Cf. <em>Avon Lake City School Dist. </em>v. <em>Limbach </em>(1988), 35 Ohio St. 3d 118, 518 N.E. 2d 1190.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-7\">We have recognized the general appealability of SERB adjudications pursuant to R.C. 119.12. In <em>South Community, Inc. </em>v. <em>State Emp. Relations Bd. </em>(1988), 38 Ohio St. 3d 224, 226, 527 N.E. 2d 864, 866, we were urged \u201cto limit R.C. Chapter 119\u2019s application solely to rulemaking provisions, and thereby exempt SERB\u2019S adjudications from that chapter\u2019s appeal procedures. * * *\u201d In response, we held that SERB\u2019S adjudications are subject to judicial review pursuant to R.C. 119.12, specifically by R.C. 4117.02(M). Having previously determined that SERB\u2019S adjudications may be appealable under R.C. 119.12, we are now required to determine when the right to appeal arises.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-8\">R.C. 119.06 provides that \u201c[n]o adjudication order shall be valid unless an opportunity for a hearing is afforded in accordance with sections 119.01 to 119.13 of the Revised Code. * * *\u201d In <em>State, ex rel. Bd. of Edn. of Bratenahl Local School Dist., </em>v. <em>Bd. of Edn. </em>(1978), 53 Ohio St. 2d 173, 176, 7 O.O. 3d 357, 358, 373 N.E. 2d 1238, 1241, citing Section 4(B), Article IV of the Ohio Constitution, we held that \u201c[bjefore an appeal can successfully be brought to the Court of Common Pleas</p>\n<p id=\"b190-10\">* * * under the provisions of R.C. Chapter 119, the proceedings * * * must have been quasi-judicial in nature. * * *\u201d An adjudication order is issued in a quasi-judicial proceeding where, as herein, the parties were given an opportunity for a hearing. <em>State, ex rel. Harris, </em>v. <em>Williams </em>(1985), 18 Ohio St. 3d 198, 201-202, 18 OBR 263, 266, 480 N.E. 2d 471, 473-474; R.C. 119.06.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-11\">Having concluded that SERB\u2019S rerun election order is a valid adjudicatory order, the next question is whether the order must be final to be appealable.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-12\">R.C. 2505.03(A) provides that \u201c[e]very final order, judgment, or decree of a court and, <em>when provided by law, the final order of any administrative officer, agency, board, </em>department, tribunal, commission, or other instrumentality may be reviewed on appeal by a court of common pleas * * (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b190-14\">We have previously held that the finality requirement of R.C. 2505.03 (A) applies to various statutory schemes permitting appeal of orders to the court of common pleas. In <em>Stewart </em>v. <em>Midwestern Indemn. Co. </em>(1989), 45 Ohio St. 3d 124, 543 N.E. 2d 1200, we indicated that R.C. 2711.15, providing for appeal of arbitration proceedings, should be read <em>in pari materia </em>with R.C. 2505.02. See, also, <em>Bellaire City Schools Bd. of Edn. </em>v. <em>Paxton </em>(1979), 59 Ohio St. 2d 65, 13 O.O. 3d 58, 391 N.E. 2d 1021. In <em>Harris, supra, </em>we were faced with the question of whether a letter issued by the Department of Industrial Relations pursuant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>to R.C. Chapter 4115<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> advising employees of a company of their right to sue for recovery of unpaid wages is an adjudication vesting the court of appeals with the right of review. We stated there that the letter was not issued pursuant to an adjudication and also was not a final appealable order. <em>Id. </em>at 201, 18 OBR at 266, 480 N.E. 2d at 473. In <em>Ohio Academy of Trial Lawyers </em>v. <em>Dept. of Ins. </em>(1983), 4 Ohio St. 3d 201, 4 OBR 519, 448 N.E. 2d 141, we held that a letter from an attorney-examiner indicating that a hearing was unnecessary did not constitute a final order of an agency issued pursuant to an adjudication as required by R.C. 119.12.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-4\">In view of the foregoing, we conclude that SERB orders must comply with R.C. 2505.02 to be appealable.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-5\">R.C. 2505.02 defines a \u201cfinal order\u201d as \u201c[a]n order affecting [1] a substantial right in an action which in effect [2] determines the action and [3] prevents a judgment * * *.\u201d In <em>Bellaire City Schools Bd. of Edn., supra, </em>we indicated that if an order lacks any of these three factors, it cannot be a final order.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-6\">The term \u201csubstantial right\u201d has been construed to mean a \u201clegal right,\u201d one protected and supported by law. <em>Armstrong </em>v. <em>Herancourt Brewing Co. </em>(1895), 53 Ohio St. 467, 42 N.E. 425. For an order to determine the action and prevent a judgment for the party appealing, it must dispose of the whole merits of the cause or some separate and distinct branch thereof and leave nothing for the determination of the court. <em>Jolley </em>v. <em>Martin Brothers Box Co. </em>(1952), 158 Ohio St. 416, 49 O.O. 29, 109 N.E. 2d 652; <em>Bellaire City Schools Bd. of Edn., supra; </em>see <em>Rossford Exempted Village School Dist. </em>v. <em>State Bd. of Edn. </em>(1989), 45 Ohio St. 3d 356, 544 N.E. 2d 651; <em>Stewart, supra; </em>see, also, Note, What is a Final Order in Ohio (1950), 19 Cin. L. Rev. 507, 509.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-9\">Because SERB\u2019S order not only vacated the election result but also provided for a rerun election, it cannot be considered one which \u201cdetermines the action and prevents a judgment\u201d within the meaning of R.C. 2505.02. <em>Stewart, supra, </em>at 126, 543 N.E. 2d at 1202. We therefore hold that a SERB order mandating a rerun certification election is an interlocutory order and is therefore not appealable pursuant to R.C. 119.12. See <em>Snell </em>v. <em>Cincinnati Street Ry. Co. </em>(1899), 60 Ohio St. 256, 54 N.E. 270; <em>Kennedy </em>v. <em>Chalfin </em>(1974), 38 Ohio St. 2d 85, 67 O.O. 2d 90, 310 N.E. 2d 233; <em>Hermiston </em>v. <em>Emp. Relations Bd. </em>(1977), 280 Ore. 291, 295, 570 P. 2d 663, 665.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-10\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b191-11\">Finally, we are required to decide whether SERB may be a party in an appeal of its adjudication order to the court of common pleas.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-12\">In <em>DiCillo &amp; Sons, Inc. </em>v. <em>Chester Zoning Bd. of Appeals </em>(1952), 158 Ohio St. 302, 303, 49 O.O. 135, 136, 109 N.E. 2d 8, 9, we were faced with the question of \u201c* * * whether a township board of zoning appeals or any of its members as such have any right to appeal from the judgment of a court, rendered on appeal from a decision of such board * * *.\u201d We held that a statutory grant of a right of appeal to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>\u201c[a]ny person adversely affected by a decision of a township board of zoning appeals\u201d did not extend to the board or any of its members. <em>Id. </em>at 304-305, 49 O.O. at 136,109 N.E. 2d at 10. Recognizing that the board represents the public\u2019s interest in having appeals correctly heard and decided, we indicated that the availability of sufficient partisan representation of the public interest should be considered in deciding whether to allow the board to participate in the appeal of its decision. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b192-4\">In <em>Gold Coast Realty, Inc. </em>v. <em>Cleveland Bd. of Zoning Appeals </em>(1971), 26 Ohio St. 2d 37, 55 O.O. 2d 20, 268 N.E. 2d 280, it was urged that the city of Cleveland and its commissioner of building could not be parties to the appeal of a board of zoning appeals\u2019 decision because they occupied a governmental position similar to the position of the board. We rejected the contention and held that the city and its commissioner of building could properly appeal from the decision of the common pleas court.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-5\">Unlike the township board of zoning appeals in <em>DiCillo </em>which was established for the purpose of hearing appeals,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> SERB, in addition to its quasi-judicial function, is given enforcement powers by R.C. Chapter 4117.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-6\">R.C. 4117.13 provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b192-7\">\u201c(A) The state employment relations board or the complaining party may petition the court of common pleas for any county wherein an unfair labor practice occurs, or wherein any person charged with the commission of any unfair labor practice resides or transacts business, for the enforcement of the order and for appropriate temporary relief or restraining order. * * * When the board petitions the court, the complaining party may intervene in the case as a matter of right. Upon the filing, the court shall cause notice thereof to be served upon the person charged with committing the unfair labor practice and thereupon has jurisdiction of the proceeding and the question determined therein. * * \u2021\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b192-13\">Since any complaint filed under R.C. 119.12 for review of a SERB final adjudication may have to be consolidated with any pending board-initiated enforcement action under R.C. 4117.13, it is reasonable to conclude that the General Assembly viewed SERB as an appropriate parly to the review action. See <em>Maine </em>v. <em>Maine Labor Relations Bd. </em>(Me. 1980), 413 A. 2d 510, 512-513; <em>Public Emp. Relations Comm. </em>v. <em>Orlando </em>(Fla. 1984), 452 So. 2d 517. It is preferable to confer direct party status on SERB on appeal rather than requiring SERB to bring an enforcement action whenever it believes the public interest warrants its participation. <em>Id. </em>at 519.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-14\">Sound policy reasons support the recognition of SERB as a party in review proceedings. The union and the employer can be depended upon to advance their own interests, but SERB\u2019S participation ensures that the broad public interest will be adequately represented when necessary. Furthermore, participation in review proceedings complements SERB\u2019S public responsibilities under R.C. Chapter 4117. SERB\u2019S statutory powers and functions make it appropriate to permit it to participate in appeals from its decisions. This is not to say that SERB is a necessary or indispensable party or that it should participate in every review proceeding.

As indicated by the majority, there are four major issues for us to resolve in this case. I write separately because our determination of these issues could very well have an effect on administrative law and labor relations in our state for an extended period of time.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-10\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b193-11\">In proposition of law number four, appellee, \u201cMRDD,\u201d argues that the State Employment Relations Board, \u201cSERB,\u201d is not a proper party to common pleas court proceedings brought pursuant to R.C. 119.12. The court of appeals agreed with MRDD on the basis that SERB is not a \u201cperson\u201d or \u201cparty\u201d within the meaning of R.C. 119.01 and, therefore, could not bring an appeal pursuant to R.C. 119.12. Thus, according to the court of appeals, SERB has no right to participate in any capacity in an appeal brought pursuant to R.C. 119.12.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-12\">MRDD\u2019s contention and the holding of the court of appeals are clearly in error. In addition to those parts of R.C. 119.12 cited by MRDD and the court of appeals, the section also provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b193-13\">\u201cThe judgment of the court shall be final and conclusive unless reversed, vacated, or modified on appeal. Such appeals may be taken either by the party <em>or the agency </em>* * * and shall be pursuant to the Rules of Appellate Procedure * * *. Such appeal <em>by the agency </em>shall be taken on questions of law relating to the constitutionality, construction, or interpretation of statutes and rules of the agency, and in such appeal the court may also review and determine the correctness of the judgment of the court of common pleas * * *.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b193-14\">It is obvious, and elementary, that if an agency can appeal from the judgment of a court of common pleas, that agency must also be able to participate in the proceedings which occur in the court of common pleas. Accordingly, without addressing the adjudication-enforcement argument, it is enough to say that the statute permits SERB to be a party in appellate review and, in addition, that sound public policy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>reasons support SERB\u2019S right to participate in cases involving appellate review of its decisions. See, further, <em>Blue Cross of Northeast Ohio </em>v. <em>Ratchford </em>(1980), 64 Ohio St. 2d 256, 18 O.O. 3d 450, 416 N.E. 2d 614, where we recognized that there is a difference between courts and administrative agencies with regard to adjudication and enforcement.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-4\">I concur in the first sentence of paragraph five of the syllabus of the majority opinion. Since we are not called upon to decide the question decided in the second sentence of paragraph five, I make no judgment thereon.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b194-6\">I concur in paragraph two of the syllabus and the discussion of the majority supporting the holding.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-7\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b194-8\">I concur with paragraph four of the syllabus, as it is a correct proposition of law. I do not agree, however, with the majority\u2019s assertions and discussion supporting the proposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-9\">The appeal herein of the SERB directive was filed pursuant to R.C. 119.12. Such right of appeal, when it exists, arises from orders of state administrative agencies whereby \u201c[a]ny party adversely affected by any order of an agency issued pursuant to any other <em>adjudication </em>may appeal to the court of common pleas * * (Emphasis added.) \u201cAdjudication\u201d is defined in R.C. 119.01(D) as \u201c* * * the determination by the highest or ultimate authority of an agency of the rights, duties, privileges, benefits, or legal relationships of a <em>specified person </em>* * *.\u201d (Emphasis added.) \u201cPerson\u201d is defined in R.C. 119.01(F) as \u201c* * * a person, firm, corporation, association, or partnership.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b194-12\">MRDD argues that it is a \u201cperson\u201d because it is a \u201cpublic employer,\u201d and R.C. 4117.01(A) provides that the term \u201cperson\u201d includes \u201cpublic employers.\u201d However, MRDD, in order to reach its desired conclusion, mixes apples with oranges \u2014 R.C. Chapter 4117 with R.C. Chapter 119. MRDD states that R.C. 4117.02(M) makes SERB\u2019S orders subject to an R.C. Chapter 119 appeal. I disagree with this proposition but accept it for purposes of argument. If MRDD is correct, then the <em>descriptive </em>terms set forth in <em>R.C. Chapter 119 </em>must be used to determine the requirements for appeal \u2014 not the definitional terms of R.C. Chapter 4117.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-13\">MRDD uses this ploy with the hope that the resulting confusion will carry the day. Recognizing the weakness of this argument, MRDD then essentially argues that it is, as a derivative of the board of county commissioners, a \u201cbody corporate and politic\u201d in an attempt to fit itself into R.C. 119.01(F).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The difficulty encountered by MRDD in this regard is that Ohio law is to the contrary!</p>\n<p id=\"b194-14\">As far back as the year 1910, this court, in <em>Board of Cty. Commrs. </em>v. <em>Gates </em>(1910), 83 Ohio St. 19, 30, 93 N.E. 255, 259, said that \u201c* * * a county is <em>not </em>a body <em>corporate </em>but rather a subordinate political division * * <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>(Emphasis added.) In <em>Schaffer </em>v. <em>Board of Trustees </em>(1960), 171 Ohio St. 228, 230, 12 O.O. 2d 343, 344, 168 N.E. 2d 547, 549, the court said that \u201c* * * a county is a subdivision of the state, organized for judicial and political purposes. It is <em>not </em>a legal person or a separate political entity. * * *\u201d (Emphasis added.) The <em>Schaffer </em>court then explained the difference between a county as an organization and a true corporation such as a \u201cmunicipal corporation.\u201d See, also, <em>Western Pa. Natl. Bank </em>v. <em>Ross </em>(C.A. 6, 1965), 345 F. 2d 525.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-3\">Thus, it is clear that neither MRDD nor the board of county commissioners is a <em>\u201cspecified </em>person\u201d as required by R.C. 119.01(D). Further, it is clear that neither entity is a \u201cperson\u201d as defined in R.C. 119.01(F). Accordingly, even though I agree with paragraph four of the syllabus (and paragraph three of the syllabus as an abstract proposition of law<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>), there has been no \u201cadjudication\u201d which these entities may appeal.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Thus, the SERB order is interlocutory and hence not appealable, and R.C. 2505.02 is inapplicable since the requirements of R.C. Chapter 119 have not first been met.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-4\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b195-5\">Further, SERB\u2019S order was not an \u201cadjudication\u201d as required by R.C. 119.12 and defined in R.C. 119.01(D). The rerun election order of SERB did not determine the rights, duties, privileges, benefits, or legal relationships of a specified person. All the order did was establish the right of the union and a group of unnamed employees to have a new election. In fact, it is conceivable that in a <em>fairly </em>held rerun election, MRDD could win. Then, of course, there would be nothing to appeal. Accordingly, SERB\u2019S rerun election order was not an \u201cadjudication\u201d and, therefore, is not appealable.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-9\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b195-10\">Our problems with today\u2019s case are directly attributable to our decision in <em>South Community, Inc. </em>v. <em>State Emp. Relations Bd. </em>(1988), 38 Ohio St. 3d 224, 527 N.E. 2d 864. In that case, I warned, in my dissent, that \u201c* * * [p]iecemeal appeals such as that allowed today will cripple the bargaining process beyond rehabilitation. * * *\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 231, 527 N.E. 2d at 870. Further, \u201c* * * [i]f collective bargaining is permitted to be repeatedly disrupted by scattershot appeals such as the one allowed today, the entire process will disintegrate and the noble purposes of the Act will be frustrated.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 232, 527 N.E. 2d at 871.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-11\">While I am pleased that today\u2019s majority now seems to see the error of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number><em>South Community </em>and limits, to some degree, its effectiveness, it is my judgment that we should meet the entire problem head-on and overrule <em>South Community. </em>By adding as accepted authority <em>Staples </em>v. <em>Ohio Civ. Serv. Emp. Assn./American Fed. of State, Cty. &amp; Mun. Emp., Local 11, AFL-CIO </em>(1986), 32 Ohio App. 3d 9, 513 N.E. 2d 821, the majority just compounds the problem.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-4\">The procedural history of <em>Staples </em>should be recalled. This court had originally <em>unanimously </em>decided to review <em>Staples. </em>Subsequent to our vote certifying the case for review, the parties entered into a joint motion to dismiss the appeal on the basis that they had settled their differences and the appeal was moot. Acting on that motion, this court, in <em>Staples </em>v. <em>Ohio Civ. Serv. Emp. Assn./American Fed. of State, Cty. &amp; Mun. Emp., Local 11, AFL-CIO </em>(1987), 31 Ohio St. 3d 602, 31 OBR 490, 510 N.E. 2d 805, dismissed the appeal. I dissented as to the dismissal because I believed then and still believe that the issue in <em>Staples </em>of the final appealability of a rerun election order under R.C. Chapter 119 was a \u201c * * question of great public or general interest * * \u201d <em>id. </em>at 603, 31 OBR at 490, 510 N.E. 2d at 805, which this court should have decided at that time. Our failure to do so now leaves the holding of the <em>Staples </em>case untested by Supreme Court appellate review and directly leads us to today\u2019s decision which seems, in my opinion, to go against the holding in <em>Staples, </em>all the while citing it as authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-7\">VI</p>\n<p id=\"b196-8\">This leads, then, to a discussion of the last issue in this case and to paragraph one of the syllabus in the majority opinion. I respectfully dissent from the holding pronounced in paragraph one and the discussion supporting the proposition set forth. MRDD is not a \u201cperson\u201d entitled to appeal an order of SERB pursuant to R.C. 119.12.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-10\">R.C. 119.12 provides that a \u201cparty\u201d may appeal any order of an agency issued pursuant to an \u201cadjudication.\u201d To be a \u201cparty,\u201d one must also be a \u201cperson\u201d pursuant to R.C. 119.01(G). To be a \u201cperson,\u201d one must meet the definition found in R.C. 119.01(F). I have already set forth that MRDD does not meet the \u201cadjudication\u201d requirements or the \u201cperson\u201d requirements of the statute. Accordingly, MRDD is not entitled to appeal the order of SERB now under review. See, further, <em>State, ex rel. Osborn, </em>v. <em>Jackson </em>(1976), 46 Ohio St. 2d 41, 75 O.O. 2d 132, 346 N.E. 2d 141, and <em>Thaxton </em>v. <em>Medina City Bd. of Edn. </em>(1986), 21 Ohio St. 3d 56, 21 OBR 357, 488 N.E. 2d 136.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-11\">VII</p>\n<p id=\"b196-12\">In conclusion, the real tragedy of this case is the disenfranchising, for a substantial period of time, of certain public employees who were meant, by the General Assembly in enacting R.C. Chapter 4117, to be protected by the representation and collective bargaining process. We have fostered and perpetuated this unfairness by our decision in <em>South Community </em>where I predicted that allowing a public employer to appeal election proceedings would result in repeated delays which very well could cripple the bargaining process.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-13\">The case at bar perfectly illustrates my point. Employees, through their chosen union, Professionals Guild of Ohio, filed a petition for a representation election with SERB on <em>July 15, 1985. </em>The election was held on October 15, 1985 but, upon appeal to SERB, the election was found not to have been fairly conducted because of certain ac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>tions of MRDD.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> SERB ordered a rerun election but, instead of complying, MRDD appealed SERB\u2019S order. The case has been tied up in the courts ever since \u2014 and it is now the fall of <em>1989, </em>four years later.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-4\">Thus, the employees of MRDD have had no opportunity to vote in a <em>fair </em>election in order to decide whether to be represented by Professionals Guild. Such an unwarranted delay infringes on the employees\u2019 rights granted them in R.C. 4117.03(A)(1). Courts should not be unwitting participants in such a travesty and, hopefully, today\u2019s decision will put such activities to rest.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-8\">Accordingly, this court should dismiss the entire appeal for lack of jurisdiction. Because the majority decision does not do so, I concur in part and dissent in part.</p>\n<judges id=\"b197-9\">Sweeney and Resnick, JJ., concur in the foregoing opinion.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b194-10\"> I question whether the board of county commissioners (or, for that matter, the commissioners as individuals) are proper parties to this appeal. SERB has not ordered the board or the commissioners, as individuals, to take any action. Only MRDD was the subject of SERB\u2019S order. The board and commissioners only became parties by having their names added to an appeal of an order that did not directly affect them.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-16\">Likewise, MRDD argues that it is an \u201cassociation\u201d and, therefore, fits in R.C. 119.01(F). This argument does not merit further discussion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b195-6\"> The discussion of R.C. 2505.02 in the majority opinion is not complete. There is more than just the first prong of the section. An order, such as we have here under review, might very well be argued to be one affecting a substantial right in a special proceeding. See <em>Lorain Edn. Assn. </em>v. <em>Lorain City School Dist. Bd. of Edn. </em>(1989), 45 Ohio St. 3d 12, 16-17, 544 N.E. 2d 687, 691 (Douglas, J., concurring); <em>Stewart </em>v. <em>Midwestern Indemn. Co. </em>(1989), 45 Ohio St. 3d 124, 127, 543 N.E. 2d 1200, 1203 (Douglas, J., dissenting). See, also, <em>Chef Italiano Corp. </em>v. <em>Kent State Univ. </em>(1989), 44 Ohio St. 3d 86, 541 N.E. 2d 64.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b195-13\"> The argument is made by appellee(s) that such a holding would permit labor organizations (\u201cassociations\u201d) to appeal SERB\u2019S rulings but prevent non-corporate public employers from appealing. This, of course, is incorrect. Public employers (political subdivisions) may obtain judicial review of SERB orders in representation cases by using the unfair-labor-practice process. R.C. 4117.13.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b197-5\"> MRDD was ordered to provide the Guild with a list of eligible voters. At various times, MRDD provided at least four different lists. One of the lists was provided just forty-five minutes before the election was to take place.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-6\">In addition, MRDD distributed anti-union literature to the employees, both during working hours on MRDD property and through the mails. Part of this information and literature is included in the record and conveys the impression that public employees in Ohio could be jailed for participating in a strike authorized pursuant to R.C. Chapter 4117. This is, of course, incorrect.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-11\">Staff meetings concerning the issue were held by the employers during work time and on the work premises. At such meetings, anti-union literature was distributed and commentary unfavorable to the union was presented. The union was never given equal access to the employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-12\">It was for these and other reasons that SERB ordered a rerun election and this part of SERB\u2019S order has been affirmed by both the trial court and the court of appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-13\">Of course, the rerun election has not yet been held!</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
