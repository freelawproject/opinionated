J. Pavert, her surviving husband, was appointed administrator of her estate by the superior court of Alameda County. Upon his petition, the court made an order directing a sale of the real <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>estate of said decedent, dent, and one of her heirs. F. D. Love, the father of the deceappeals from this order.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-7\">The petition asked for ; sale of the real estate was debts of the decedent, ar of administration, and, se benefit, and best intereste therein that said real estap the existence of both gro sale upon the grounds, first, that a necessary to pay the outstanding d the debts, expenses, and charges ond, that it was for the advantage, of the estate and those interested e be sold.

The debts of mortgage obligations, amounted dred dollars, and the expenses, ac-administration came to $977. The idministrator testified, that he had that there was no other personal estate.

The this claim had been settled. The the eleven thousand dollars indebt- and unsatisfactory. We may eon-re one requiring determination in below might well, and perhaps at the administrator, in fact, was iceount of the note. But the fact tl <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>remains that the liability was disputed. Not only this, but there was no showing that the demand against the administrator, granting its validity, could be collected. The claim was, therefore, at best a doubtful one.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-5\">The mere fact that there is personal property belonging to the estate does not preclude a sale of realty. Section 1358 of the Civil Code provides that all of the property of a person dying intestate, real and personal, \u201cwithout any distinction between them,\u201d is chargeable with the payment of his debts. Similarly, section 1516 of the Code of Civil Procedure declares that all of the property of a decedent shall be chargeable with the payment of his debts, of expenses of administration and family allowance, and that the property, real and personal, may be sold under the direction of the court, as prescribed by the code. \u201cThere shall be,\u201d the section adds, \u201cno priority as between personal and real property for the above purposes.\u201d In harmony with the rule thus enacted, section 1536 of the Code of Civil Procedure, as it now reads, does not make a deficiency of personal estate one of the prerequisites to an order for a sale of realty. Property, real or personal, may be sold \u201cwhen a sale of property of the estate is necessary\u201d to pay family allowance, debts, or expenses of administration. Under the probate act, which was followed in the original enactment of the codes, resort for payment of debts and expenses was first had to personalty, and a sale of real estate could be ordered only when the personal estate in the hands of the executor was exhausted or insufficient. But the contrary rule, now in force, was enacted in 1874. (Code amdts. 1873-74, pp. 234, 367, 369; see <em>Richardson </em>v. <em>Butler, </em>82 Cal. 174, 176, [16 Am. St. Rep. 101, 23 Pac. 9].)</p>\n<p id=\"b417-6\">In the present state of the law, then, the court is authorized to order a sale of real or of personal property whenever such sale is necessary for any of the purposes enumerated in section 1536 of the Code of Civil Procedure. Whether it shall order a sale of the one or the other is a' question committed to its sound discretion. So long, at least, as the cash on hand or readily collectible is not sufficient to pay debts or expenses, the court has authority to order a sale of real property. There may be circumstances under which it would be an abuse of discretion to direct such a sale, instead of resorting to the personal estate. But certainly this could not be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>said in a case where, as here, the personal property consists of a disputed claim of doubtful value.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-5\">It must, therefore, be held that the court below was justified in finding that the sale was necessary to pay debts and expenses of administration. We need not inquire whether the showing was sufficient to support the sale upon the further ground that it would be for the advantage, benefit, and best interests of the estate and those interested therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-6\">The order is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-7\">Shaw, J., and Richards, J., <em>pro tern,., </em>concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
