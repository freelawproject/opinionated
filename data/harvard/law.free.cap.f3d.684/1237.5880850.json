After review, we conclude the district court properly refused to group these convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1254-4\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"AfCE\">A. Arrest and Guilty Plea</p>\n<p id=\"b1254-5\">Defendant Jimenez is a citizen of Mexico. In 1994, Jimenez was convicted of felony drug trafficking offenses in California state court and served over a year in prison. In 1996, Jimenez was removed from the United States and then removed again in 1998 and 2007. After his 2007 removal, Jimenez illegally reentered the United States in 2008 by walking across the border into Texas.</p>\n<p id=\"b1254-6\">In December 2010, a police officer in Gwinnett County, Georgia, observed a passenger sitting inside a vehicle parked in a motel parking lot. When the officer asked the passenger whether he was a guest at the motel, the passenger indicated that his friend was reserving a room. Because the officer smelled marijuana, he asked the passenger for identification and permission to search the vehicle. The passenger consented to a search.</p>\n<p id=\"b1254-7\">At this point, Defendant Jimenez approached the vehicle. Jimenez told the officer that he was driving the vehicle, but it belonged to a friend. Jimenez also consented to a search of the vehicle. During the search, officers discovered one firearm inside the pocket of a jacket lying on the driver\u2019s side of the vehicle and another firearm under the passenger seat.</p>\n<p id=\"b1254-8\">Jimenez was charged with reentering the United States after being deported, in violation of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(a) and (b)(2) (Count 1), and possessing a firearm as an illegal alien, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(5) (Count 2). Jimenez pled guilty to both counts. At the plea hearing, Jimenez admitted that the gun found in the jacket was his, that he obtained the gun from a friend who was returning to Mexico and that he had the gun \u201cbecause [he] was thinking about selling it\u201d because he \u201cdidn\u2019t have money to pay [his] rent.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1254-10\">B. Sentencing</p>\n<p id=\"b1254-11\">The Presentence Investigation Report (\u201cPSi\u201d) ca\u00a1cuiated Jimenez\u2019s offense level separately for each count of conviction and then determined the combined offense level using U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3D1.4. Specifically, the PSI assigned Count 1 (illegal reentry) a base offense level of 8, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(a), and then applied a 16-level adjustment, pursuant to \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A), due to Jimenez\u2019s prior felony drug trafficking offense, yielding an adjusted offense level of 24. For Count 2 (firearm possession), the PSI assigned a base offense level of 20, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(a)(4), because Jimenez committed Count 2 after having sustained a felony conviction for a controlled substance offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b1254-12\">Then, applying U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3D1.4(a), the PSI added 2 levels to the highest offense level of the two counts of conviction (level 24 for Count 1), for an adjusted total offense level of 26. After applying a 3-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility, the PSI calculated a total offense level of 23. Jimenez\u2019s criminal history category of III and total offense level of 23 resulted in an advisory guidelines range of 57 to 71 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1254-13\">Jimenez objected, arguing that his offense level should be calculated by grouping his two counts of conviction together, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3D1.2, and that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1239\">*1239</page-number>2-level enhancement under \u00a7 3D 1.4(a) should not apply.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1255-5\">At sentencing, the district court overruled Jimenez\u2019s objection and found that Jimenez had a total offense level of 23 and a criminal history of III, which yielded an advisory guidelines range of 57 to 71 months. The district court imposed a concurrent 57-month sentence on each count. Jimenez filed this appeal challenging the district court\u2019s refusal to group Counts 1 and 2 for purposes of calculating his offense level.</p>\n<p id=\"b1255-6\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1255-7\">When a defendant has more than one count of conviction, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3D1.1 of the Sentencing Guidelines instructs the district court to group the counts \u201cinto distinct Groups of Closely Related Counts\u201d by applying the rules in \u00a7 3D 1.2. After that is done, the district court determines the offense level for each Group by applying the rules in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3D1.3. The district court then determines the \u201ccombined offense level\u201d applicable to all \u201cGroups taken together\u201d by applying the rules in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3D1.4. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3Dl.l(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b1255-8\">A. Grouping Under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3D1.2</p>\n<p id=\"b1255-9\">Under \u00a7 3D1.2, counts of conviction are grouped together if they \u201cinvolve substantially the same harm within the meaning of this rule.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3D1.2. Counts involve \u201csubstantially the same harm\u201d under this rule when they satisfy any of these four requirements: (a) they \u201cinvolve the same victim and the same act or transaction\u201d; (b) they \u201cinvolve the same victim and two or more acts or transactions\u201d that either are \u201cconnected by a common criminal objective\u201d or constitute \u201cpart of a common scheme or plan\u201d; (c) \u201cone of the counts embodies conduct that is treated as a specific offense characteristic in, or other adjustment to, the guideline applicable to another of the counts\u201d; or (d) the offense level for each count \u201cis determined largely on the basis of the total amount of harm or loss, the quantity of a substance involved, or some other measure of aggregate harm, or if the offense behavior is ongoing or continuous in nature and the offense guideline is written to cover such behavior.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3D1.2(a)-(d). For the reasons explained below, Jimenez\u2019s two counts of conviction do not fall within any of the four subsections in \u00a7 3D1.2.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1255-13\">B. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3D1.2(a) and (b)</p>\n<p id=\"b1255-14\">First, Jimenez\u2019s offenses do not have an identifiable victim, much less the \u201csame victim,\u201d as required in the first two grouping subsections of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3D1.2. The term \u201cvictim\u201d in \u00a7 3D1.2(a) and (b) refers to an identifiable person who was \u201cdirectly and most seriously affected by the offense\u201d and does not include \u201cindirect or secondary victims.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3D1.2 cmt. n.2. Jimenez\u2019s illegal reentry and firearm convictions do not have a victim directly affected by the offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b1255-15\">We recognize that for offenses without an identifiable victim, such as immigration offenses, the \u201cvictim\u201d is the societal interest that was harmed. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3D1.2, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1240\">*1240</page-number>cmt. n.2. We agree with the other circuits that have addressed this issue that illegal reentry under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(a) and possession of a firearm under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g) harm different societal interests. <em>See United States v. Herrera, </em>265 F.3d 349, 352-53 (6th Cir.2001) (concluding that counts for \u00a7 1326(a) and \u00a7 922(g)(5) offenses should not be grouped because the purposes behind the laws are dissimilar); <em>United States v. Salgado-Ocampo, </em>159 F.3d 322, 328 (7th Cir.1998) (concluding that \u00a7 1326(a) and \u00a7 922(g)(5) counts should not be grouped because the types of misconduct involved are dissimilar); <em>United States v. Baeza-Suchil, </em>52 F.3d 898, 899-900 (10th Cir.1995) (concluding that \u00a7 1326(a) and \u00a7 922(g)(1) counts should not be grouped because different societal interests were harmed); <em>United States v. Barron-Rivera, </em>922 F.2d 549, 554-55 (9th Cir.1991) (concluding that counts under \u00a7 1326(a) and \u00a7 922(g)(5) should not be grouped because these offenses pose threats to distinct societal interests even though both involve being an illegal alien).</p>\n<p id=\"b1256-4\">The statutes criminalizing each of Jimenez\u2019s offenses involve different conduct\u2014 reentering the United States after deportation and possessing a firearm while being an illegal alien. <em>Salgado-Ocampo, </em>159 F.3d at 328. The statutes also do not further the same societal interest. While 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326 seeks to effectively enforce immigration laws, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g) protects society against firearm possession by those deemed unqualified to possess them. <em>Herrera, </em>265 F.3d at 353. Although \u00a7 922(g)(5) has as an element being an illegal alien, this similarity with \u00a7 1326 is not enough to treat the two, otherwise very different offenses as constituting a single offense for purposes of the guidelines. <em>See Herrera, </em>265 F.3d at 352-53; <em>Salgado-Ocampo, </em>159 F.3d at 328; <em>Barron-Rivera, </em>922 F.2d at 554-55. Because the societal interests implicated by each count are distinct, the counts are not sufficiently closely related to be grouped together under \u00a7 3D1.2(a) or (b).</p>\n<p id=\"b1256-6\">C. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3D1.2(c)</p>\n<p id=\"b1256-7\">The district court also properly concluded that Jimenez\u2019s two counts of conviction do not satisfy the third grouping test in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3D1.2(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b1256-8\">Under \u00a7 3D 1.2(c), counts are grouped together if one count embodies conduct that is also a specific offense characteristic supporting an adjustment to the guideline applicable to another count. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3D 1.2(c) &amp; cmt. n.5. This subsection \u201cprevents \u2018double counting,\u2019 \u201d but \u201capplies only if the offenses are closely related.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3D1.2, cmt. n.5. Therefore, if the harm from one count is not a specific offense characteristic of the other count, the counts are not grouped under this subsection. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1256-9\">In Jimenez\u2019s case, neither offense involved conduct that was a specific offense characteristic supporting an adjustment to the offense level of the other count. That is, Jimenez\u2019s firearm possession did not enhance his offense level for his illegal reentry offense, and his illegal reentry into the United States (and status as an illegal alien) did not enhance his offense level for his firearm offense. In reaching this conclusion, we agree with two other circuits that have rejected grouping in this situation. <em>See Salgado-Ocampo, </em>159 F.3d at 328 (Seventh Circuit agreeing with the Ninth Circuit in <em>Barron-Rivera, </em>922 F.2d at 554, that the defendant\u2019s illegal immigration status is not a specific offense characteristic of either a \u00a7 1326(a) or a \u00a7 922(g)(5) offense).</p>\n<p id=\"b1256-10\">Jimenez complains that his prior felony drug trafficking conviction was a specific offense characteristic that enhanced both <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1241\">*1241</page-number>counts. However, his prior conviction is not a conduct element of either his \u00a7 1326(a) count or his \u00a7 922(g) count. Section 3D1.2(c) requires grouping when a specific offense characteristic for one count is also the conduct representing another count, which is not the case here.</p>\n<p id=\"b1257-5\">D. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3D1.2(d)</p>\n<p id=\"b1257-6\">The district court also did not err in concluding that grouping was inappropriate under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3D1.2(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1257-7\">Under \u00a7 3D1.2(d), counts are grouped if each guideline provision calculates the offense level for that count based on, <em>inter alia, </em>some measure of aggregate harm, such as total loss or drug quantity. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3D1.2(d). Subsection (d) applies to \u201cmost property crimes ..., drug offenses, firearms offenses, and other crimes where the guidelines are based primarily on quantity or contemplate continuing behavior.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3D1.2, cmt. n.6.</p>\n<p id=\"b1257-8\">Although Jimenez had only one firearm, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1, the guideline applicable to Jimenez\u2019s \u00a7 922(g)(5) firearm offense, does calculate offense level based on the number of firearms. Section 2K2.1 contains specific offense characteristic adjustments based on the number of firearms involved and, thus, logically falls under subsection (d). <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b1257-9\">The problem for Jimenez is that U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2, the guideline used to calculate his offense level for his immigration offense, does not fall within the purview of, or list of covered offenses in, \u00a7 3D1.2(d). <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3D1.2(d). Section 2L1.2 does not quantify the harm to calculate the defendant\u2019s offense level. Thus, the offense level for Jimenez\u2019s immigration offense is not determined at all, much less \u201clargely,\u201d by aggregate harm. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3D1.2(d) (requiring offense level to be \u201cdetermined largely\u201d by total loss or harm).</p>\n<p id=\"b1257-10\">Grouping of unlisted offenses \u201cmay or may not be appropriate,\u201d and the court must make \u201ca case-by-case determination ... based upon the facts of the case and the applicable guidelines (including specific offense characteristics and other adjustments) used to determine the offense level.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Jimenez relies on this statement in \u00a7 3D1.2(d) and argues that his counts should have been grouped together because the applicable guideline for his firearm offense, \u00a7 2K2.1, is listed in subsection (d) as appropriate for grouping and, using a case-specific determination, the applicable guideline for his immigration offense, \u00a7 2L1.2 should also be covered. As stated above, \u00a7 2L1.2 does not meet the criteria for grouping under this subsection because it does not determine the offense level on the basis of some measure of aggregate harm. Therefore, under the facts of Jimenez\u2019s case and given the two applicable guidelines involved, the district court did not err in concluding that grouping was inappropriate under \u00a7 3D1.2(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1257-11\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1257-12\">For all of these reasons, we conclude that the district court properly refused to group Jimenez\u2019s \u00a7 1326(a) and \u00a7 922(g)(5) counts under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3D1.2 and correctly calculated Jimenez\u2019s combined offense level under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3D1.4. Accordingly, we affirm Jimenez\u2019s total 57-month sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1257-13\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1255-10\">. Grouping Counts 1 and 2 under \u00a7 3D 1.2 would have eliminated the 2-level enhancement under \u00a7 3D 1.4(a) and produced an offense level of 24. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3D1.3. With the 3-level adjustment for acceptance-of-responsibility, the total offense level would be 21 and the advisory guidelines range would be 46 to 57 months' imprisonment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1255-16\">.
