L. c. 32, \u00a7 10 (2) (a). Hayes seeks to have the pension portion of his retirement allowance calculated according to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>compensation he would have received had he not been injured and been receiving workers\u2019 compensation for the five years preceding his termination, and contends that G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 14 (1) (a), supports his position. We transferred the case to this court on our own motion. We affirm the decision of the Superior Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b489-6\">Hayes began working for the city of Newton in 1968, filling a number of positions requiring physical labor. During this time, Hayes was a member of the city\u2019s contributory retirement system and his rate of pay was set by the city. In February, 1987, Hayes injured his back while on the job. Approximately six weeks later, he again injured his back while at work. As a result of this second injury, Hayes was unable to work and began receiving workers\u2019 compensation benefits pursuant to G. L. c. 152, during which time the city continued to carry Hayes on its payroll and Hayes accrued sick leave and other benefits. On August 4, 1992, Hayes was notified that his employment with the city had been terminated as a result of his physical inability to perform his former duties. Hayes elected to receive his superannuation retirement allowance according to G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 12, option (c).</p>\n<p id=\"b489-7\">A public employee\u2019s retirement allowance is comprised of two parts: an annuity funded by the employee through accumulated deductions from the employee\u2019s salary, and a pension funded by the employer. The latter makes up the larger portion of the retirement allowance prescribed by law. By virtue of G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 10 (2) (a), the pension portion is determined by means of a formula which is based on the employee\u2019s \u201caverage annual rate of regular compensation received during any period of five consecutive years of creditable service for which such rate of compensation was the highest.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The retirement board of Newton (board) calculated Hayes\u2019 pension utilizing the figures for Hayes\u2019 regular compensation which he had received from 1982 through 1987. These calculations were subsequently approved by the public employee retirement administration (PERA). Hayes challenged the board\u2019s decision in September, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>1992, arguing that this calculation should have been made according to the salary that had been set by the city and was in effect for his position on the date of his termination in 1992 and the five years preceding it \u2014 the salary which Hayes would have received had he not been injured.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-5\">A hearing was held before an administrative magistrate on December 9, 1993, who accepted Hayes\u2019 argument that G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 14 (1) <em>(a), </em>allowed Hayes \u201cto be regarded, for purposes of retirement, as though his employment in the service of the commonwealth had not been interrupted by his industrial accident.\u201d The city appealed from this decision to the Contributory Retirement Appeal Board (CRAB) which rejected the administrative magistrate\u2019s reasoning and affirmed the decision of the board. On appeal by Hayes, the Superior Court upheld CRAB\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b490-7\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b490-8\">As a reviewing court, we \u201caccord due weight and deference to an agency\u2019s reasonable interpretation of a statute within its charge.\u201d <em>Boston Neighborhood Taxi Ass\u2019n </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Utils., </em>410 Mass. 686, 692 (1991); <em>Colo </em>v. <em>Contributory Retirement Appeal Bd., </em>37 Mass. App. Ct. 185, 188 (1994). In this case, both agencies concerned with this issue, PERA and CRAB, reached the conclusion that Hayes\u2019 retirement allowance should be calculated on the basis of the compensation he received prior to his ceasing active work.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-9\">The crux of this dispute centers around the meaning of the phrase \u201cregular compensation received\u201d which appears in G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 10 (2) <em>(a). </em>The relevant portion of this statute provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b490-10\">\u201cAny member who retires under the provisions of this section, who has completed twenty or more years of creditable service . . . shall receive a normal yearly amount of retirement allowance which shall not be less Ilian the sum of his annuity, which shall be the actuarial equivalent of his accumulated regular deductions at his attained age on the date the allowance becomes effective, and a <em>pension equal to a sum of not less than one-third of his average annual rate of regular compensation received </em>during any period of [five] consecutive years of creditable service for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>which such rate of compensation was the highest ...\u201d (emphasis supplied).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b491-5\">Hayes focuses on the definition of \u201cregular compensation\u201d while the board stresses the word \u201creceived.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b491-6\">Arguing that he is entitled to a pension based on the pay scale set for his position during the time he was receiving workers\u2019 compensation, Hayes directs us to the definitions provided in G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 1, which provide that \u201c \u2018[r]egular compensation\u2019 . . . shall mean the full salary, wages or other compensation in whatever form, lawfully determined for the individual service of the employee by the employing authority . . .\u201d Because this definition equates regular compensation with the wages determined for the position, and includes no requirement that the employee actually receive such pay, Hayes insists that the fact that the city\u2019s approved salary schedule determined a rate of pay for his position between 1987 and 1992 entitles him to a retirement pension based on an average of the salaries set for those five years, just as if he had performed his work-related duties over the course of that period. The board does not contest Hayes\u2019 use of this statutory definition for regular compensation, but argues that Hayes ignores the explicit language of G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 10 (2) (a), which speaks of \u201cregular compensation received\u201d (emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b491-7\">As the board points out, \u201c[t]he usual and ordinary meaning of the word \u2018received\u2019 does not include the term \u2018would have received but for his injury,\u2019 \u201d see <em>Naples </em>v. <em>Commissioner of the Dep\u2019t of Employment &amp; Training, </em>412 Mass. 631, 634 (1992) (\u201cusual and ordinary meaning of the word \u2018paid\u2019 does not encompass wages earned but not paid\u201d), nor does it mean \u201cset,\u201d \u201cdetermined,\u201d or \u201cassigned\u201d by the city. We have repeatedly held that, \u201c[wjhere the statutory language is clear, it must be given its plain and ordinary meaning.\u201d <em>Brook House Condominium Trust </em>v. <em>Automatic Sprinkler Appeals Bd., </em>414 Mass. 303, 306 (1993), quoting <em>Nationwide Mut. Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Ins., </em>397 Mass. 416, 420 (1986). To ignore the language of \u00a7 10 (2) <em>(a), </em>or equate the word \u201creceived\u201d with any of the readings Hayes proposes, would change the plain meaning of the statute and would \u201ceffectively, and, of course, inappropriately, amend[] the statute.\u201d <em>Acme Laundry Co. </em>v. <em>Secretary of Envtl. Affairs, </em>410 Mass. 760, 780 (1991); <em>Saccone </em>v. <em>State Ethics Comm\u2019n, </em>395 Mass. 326, 332 (1985). CRAB <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>found that Hayes \u201clast received regular compensation as that term is defined by G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 1 in 1987.\u201d From 1987 to 1992, Hayes did not receive regular compensation, but instead received workers\u2019 compensation benefits under G. L. c. 152, which are not considered to be \u201cregular compensation.\u201d <em>Zelesky </em>v. <em>Commissioner of the Div. of Pub. Employee Retirement Admin., </em>30 Mass. App. Ct. 106 (1991).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b492-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b492-6\">Hayes cannot prevail under the plain language of G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 10 (2) (o). We turn then to his argument that G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 14 (1) (a), essentially trumps or modifies the language of \u00a7 10 (2) <em>(a), </em>thereby entitling him to a pension calculated on a basis of what his salary would have been had he not been injured. The relevant portions of G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 14 (1) <em>(a), </em>state:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b493-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>\u201cAny employee who was a member in service at the time of sustaining an injury ... on account of which he becomes entitled to [workers\u2019 compensation] shall . . . retain all the rights of a member in service while he is living, unless and until a retirement allowance becomes effective for him .... During such periods ... no deductions for the annuity savings fund of the system shall be made from [the workers\u2019 compensation] payments such members shall receive ....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b493-5\">\u201cAny such member shall have credited to him as creditable service under the system the period during which he is receiving such weekly payments. ... At the time of his retirement there shall be transferred from the pension fund of the system of which he was a member at the time of the accident, to the annuity savings fund of the system of which he is then a member, the amount which said person would have paid into said fund had his employment in the service of the commonwealth or political subdivision thereof not been interrupted by his industrial accident. . . provided, that any sum so paid by the commonwealth or any political subdivision thereof shall be used only to provide an increased retirement allowance of the person on whose account such payment is made.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b493-6\">Referring solely to this section of G. L. c. 32, the administrative magistrate who ruled in Hayes\u2019 favor determined that \u201cthe spirit of this section is that the retiree should not lose rights or incur additional hardship after sustaining an injury for which he collects Workers\u2019 Compensation benefits,\u201d and thus Hayes\u2019 retirement pension should be calculated according to \u201cthe average annual rate of compensation he would have received\u201d between 1987 and 1992 had he not been injured.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-7\">Section 14 protects employees who are injured on the job by allowing them to continue accumulating creditable service while receiving workers\u2019 compensation<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and by instructing the employer to make the contributions to the employee\u2019s annuity <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>fund which would have been deducted from the employee\u2019s salary had he not been injured.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> There is no corresponding language in \u00a7 14, however, which addresses the pension portion of an employee\u2019s retirement benefits, and that is the issue before us here to which \u00a7 10 speaks, using the term \u201cregular compensation received.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b494-5\">Hayes seeks to employ \u00a7 14 (1) <em>(a) </em>by stressing its first sentence which provides that an employee receiving workers\u2019 compensation \u201cshall . . . retain all the rights of a member in service.\u201d Referring back to the definitions contained in \u00a7 1, Hayes contends that an injured employee should be treated the same as an employee who is receiving regular compensation by pointing out that \u201c[sjervice\u201d is defined to be \u201cservice as an employee in a governmental unit for which regular compensation is paid.\u201d The board explains that the phrase \u201c[mjember in [sjervice\u201d is defined in \u00a7 3 (1) (i), and denotes an individual\u2019s employment status. It does not address the different question of an employee\u2019s receipt or nonreceipt of regular compensation. We agree with the board that the most straightforward reading of this sentence in \u00a7 14 addresses an employee\u2019s status and certain rights which relate to this status, such as the right to vote and to apply for a. retirement allowance. It makes no reference to the measure of compensation which should be used in calculating an injured employee\u2019s retirement allowance.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-6\">Hayes goes on to suggest that because the annuity contributions the employer is required to make on behalf of the injured employee are based on what the worker \u201cwould have paid\u201d had he not been injured, the \u201cspirit\u201d of \u00a7 14 contains a preservative <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>intent, recognized by the administrative magistrate, that carries over to a determination of the employee\u2019s regular compensation received. According to Hayes, because \u00a7 14 \u201cspecifically deals with what status an injured employee has while receiving workers\u2019 compensation, its provisions must control and be interpreted to supersede any ambiguous or conflicting provisions elsewhere in the law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b495-5\">A retirement allowance is comprised of two distinct components. The employer\u2019s obligation to make contributions to an employee\u2019s annuity fund carries no implication about the employee\u2019s pension, which is addressed in \u00a7 10 (2) (a) and is measured in terms of \u201cregular compensation received.\u201d While \u00a7 14 (1) <em>(a) </em>provides significant protections to preserve the status and retirement benefits of public employees, like Hayes, whose ability to work has been interrupted by an industrial accident, it does not speak to the issue of how to assess the amount of \u201cregular compensation received\u201d in calculating the pension portion of an employee\u2019s retirement allowance, and thus we find no conflict between this provision and \u00a7 10 (2) <em>(a).</em><footnotemark><em>5</em></footnotemark><em> </em>On the contrary, that \u00a7 14 specifically addresses both creditable service and an employee\u2019s annuity payments works against Hayes by showing that the Legislature could have provided similar instruction regarding the determination of \u201cregular compensation received,\u201d but did not.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> See <em>Leary </em>v. <em>Contributory Retire-</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number><em>merit Appeal Bd., </em>421 Mass. 344, 347-348 (1995); <em>Aquino </em>v. <em>Civil Serv. Comrn\u2019n, </em>34 Mass. App. Ct. 538, 541 (1993); <em>Tilcon Mass., Inc. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Revenue, </em>30 Mass. App. Ct. 264, 269 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b496-5\">Because there is no conflict between G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 10 (2) (a), and \u00a7 14 (1) (a), and Hayes did not receive regular compensation from 1987 to 1992, we affirm the decision of the Superior Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b489-8\">General Laws c. 32, \u00a7 10 (2) <em>(a), </em>has been amended to compute an average of three years, rather than five. St. 1984, c. 473, \u00a7 1. Statute 1984, c. 473, \u00a7 2, however, provided for acceptance by the cities and towns of the Commonwealth, and the city has never accepted this amendment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b492-7\">Hayes points to a letter issued by PERA which suggests that PERA adopted Hayes\u2019 interpretation of \u201cregular compensation received\u201d in the case of another injured worker. In its letter, PERA noted that that worker had received sick pay, longevity pay, and other benefits subsequent to his injury and opined that \u201c[tjhese payments fall within the definition of regular compensation.\u201d PERA went on to state that \u201c[f]or purposes of determining [the worker\u2019s] \u2018average annual rate of regular compensation\u2019, his salary ... in effect on the date that he last received such compensation may be annualized and used in computing the amount of his pension,\u201d in order to calculate his accidental disability retirement allowance. In writing this letter, PERA never addressed the provisions of \u00a7 10 (2) <em>(a). </em>Instead, the letter was written in response to the worker\u2019s application for an accidental disability retirement allowance under the provisions of G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 7 (2), a section which protects public employees by providing a retirement allowance for any member \u201cwho becomes totally and permanently incapacitated for further duty ... by reason of a personal injury sustained or a hazard undergone\u201d during the course of his labors. We note that Hayes was free to pursue a retirement allowance under this section of the statute but chose to proceed under \u00a7 10 instead. As to the reasoning contained in PERA\u2019s letter to the other worker, we have previously read the definition of \u201cregular compensation\u201d as contained in G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 1, to refer to \u201cremuneration geared to work or services performed,\u201d <em>Boston Ass\u2019n of School Admins. &amp; Supervisors </em>v. <em>Boston Retirement Bd., </em>383 Mass. 336, 341 (1981); <em>Zelesky </em>v. <em>Commissioner of the Div. of Pub. Employee Retirement Admin., </em>30 Mass. App. Ct. 106, 108-109 (1991), and we do not find the letter sufficient to persuade us that Hayes received regular compensation during the time he was receiving workers\u2019 compensation merely because the city continued to carry him on its payroll and Hayes continued to accumulate sick leave benefits over the course of those years. We make no attempt to reconcile PERA\u2019s and our reading of \u201cregular compensation received\u201d in this case with PERA\u2019s seemingly divergent reading in the proffered letter and express no opinion as to whether this phrase entails a different reading in the context of \u00a7 7 (2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b493-8\">This accumulation of creditable service benefits the employee by increasing one of the factors used to determine the employee\u2019s retirement allowance. Pursuant to G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 5 (2), an employee\u2019s normal retirement allowance is calculated through the use of a formula which considers the employee\u2019s years of creditable service, the employee\u2019s age at retirement, his employment grouping, and his average annual rate of regular compensation. Application of this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>provision allowed Hayes to retire with credit for twenty-three years and three months of service with the city.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b494-9\">In his brief, Hayes claims that the city failed to credit his annuity savings fund with the accumulated deductions the employer is instructed to make for an injured employee under \u00a7 14 (1) <em>(a), </em>thereby \u201cillegally diminish[ing] Hayes\u2019 retirement allowance.\u201d As the defendants observe, however, Hayes fails to cite anything in the administrative record or record appendix which can support this allegation, which Newton denies, nor did he properly raise this issue in any of the proceedings prior to this appeal, see <em>M.H. Gordon &amp; Son </em>v. <em>Alcoholic Beverages Control Comm\u2019n, </em>386 Mass. 64, .73 (1982); Mass. R. A. P. 16 (e), as amended, 378 Mass. 940 (1979), and we do not consider this claim. While Hayes is certainly entitled to the annuity contributions required pursuant to \u00a7 14 (1) <em>(a), </em>we observe, arguendo, that any errors made in regard to the city\u2019s contributions to Hayes\u2019 annuity fund would have no bearing on the proper calculation of Hayes\u2019 average regular compensation as it affects the determination of his pension.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b495-6\">The administrative magistrate who accepted Hayes\u2019 arguments relied solely on the language of G.

L. c. 32, \u00a7 5 (2) <em>(a). A </em>teacher who was allowed to \u201cbuy back\u201d years during which he taught outside the Commonwealth so that they could count as creditable service was not permitted to use the salaries he received during those years to compute his \u201caverage annual rate of regular compensation received.\u201d Reviewing the statute, we noted that \u201c[t]he words \u2018regular compensation\u2019 are modified . . . by the clause \u2018received by such member during any period of three consecutive years of creditable service.\u2019 That does not imply . . . that all compensation received for creditable service must be treated as regular compensation. This clause ensures that <em>only </em>years of creditable service are considered . . . [and] does not alter the definition of regular compensation.\u201d Similarly, the provisions regarding the accumulation of creditable service in \u00a7 14 do not alter the definition of \u201cregular compensation received,\u201d and we agree with CRAB which observed that because \u201cthe issue in this matter does not deal with creditable service but with the definition of regular compensation and a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>determination of when [Hayes] received such regular compensation the provisions of G.
