The judgment was based on an arbitration award for the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-16\"><em>Facts. </em>In 1992, the parties executed a written contract providing for the construction of a $126,000 addition to the defendants\u2019 home. The contract provided that all claims and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>disputes \u201cshall be decided by arbitration . . . unless the parties mutually agree otherwise.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b346-5\">After referral the arbitrator found for the plaintiff and mailed his decision on November 19, 1993. In accordance with G. L. c. 142A, \u00a7 4 (&lt;?), the decision stated that an appeal must be filed within twenty-one days of the mailing date of the decision.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The defendants\u2019 appeal, in the form of a counterclaim to a complaint filed by the plaintiff but not yet served on the defendants, was not received by the trial court until December 13, 1993, twenty-four days after the mailing date of the arbitration decision.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b346-6\">On the plaintiff\u2019s motion, a District Court judge entered judgment on the arbitrator\u2019s decision and dismissed the defendants\u2019 counterclaim, ruling that, because the defendants had voluntarily submitted to binding arbitration and later failed to comply with the time requirements for requesting an appeal, the arbitrator\u2019s decision was final. The decision was affirmed by both the Appellate Division of the District Court and the Appeals Court, 40 Mass. App. Ct. 1109 (1996); the defendants\u2019 application for further appellate review was denied. 422 Mass. 1108 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b346-7\">In its brief to the Appeals Court the plaintiff requested that attorney\u2019s fees and costs be assessed against the defendants. Following the defendants\u2019 unsuccessful appeals, the plaintiff moved for attorney\u2019s fees, interests, and costs pursuant to G. L. c. 211A, \u00a7 15<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>; G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 6F; and Mass. R. A. P. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>25, as amended, 378 Mass. 925 (1979).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>, <footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The plaintiff also argued that the contract provided for the payment of attorney\u2019s fees incurred in collecting on the contract.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The Appeals Court denied the motion \u201cas a matter of discretion\u201d; the Appeals Court also denied the plaintiff\u2019s subsequent motion for clarification of that decision stating in part: \u201cGeneral Laws c. 231, \u00a7 6F does not apply to a judgment of the Appeals Court and the appellee\u2019s motion was not an appeal under [\u00a7] 6G to the single justice.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b347-5\"><em>Timeliness of plaintiff\u2019s G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 6G, appeal. </em>The plaintiff received notice of the decision of the Appeals Court denying its request for attorney\u2019s fees on July 31, 1996. The plaintiff appealed on August 12, 1996. General Laws c. 231, \u00a7 6G, provides that an appeal must be taken within ten days after receiving notice of the decision.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The defendants argue, therefore, that the plaintiff\u2019s appeal under G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 6G, is untimely. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>Rule 6 (a) of the Massachusetts Rules of Civil Procedure, 365 Mass. 747 (1974), provides in pertinent part: \u201cIn computing any period of time prescribed or allowed by these rules, by order of court, or by any applicable statute or rule . . . [t]he last day of the period so computed shall be included unless it is a Saturday, a Sunday, or a legal holiday, in which event the period runs until the end of the next day which is not a Saturday, a Sunday, or a legal holiday.\u201d In the instant case, the tenth day after the plaintiff received the decision of the Appeals Court was Saturday, August 10, 1996. The plaintiff, therefore, had until Monday, August 12, 1996, to file a timely appeal. See <em>Davenport </em>v. <em>Broadhurst, </em>10 Mass. App. Ct. 182, 185 (1980). Accordingly, the appeal under G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 6G, is properly before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-5\"><em>The G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 6G, appeal. </em>General Laws c. 231, \u00a7 6F, provides for the assessment of reasonable costs, including attorney\u2019s fees, incurred in litigation against a party who has advanced defenses which are wholly insubstantial, frivolous, or not made in good faith.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> See <em>Waldman </em>v. <em>American Honda Motor Co., </em>413 Mass. 320, 323 (1992); <em>Brookline </em>v. <em>Goldstein, </em>388 Mass. 443, 448 (1983). This statute ameliorates the consequences of the \u201cAmerican rule,\u201d which ordinarily denies a prevailing party the recovery of legal fees incurred in litigation. <em>Brookline </em>v. <em>Goldstein, supra. </em>See <em>Waldman </em>v. <em>American Honda Motor Co., supra; Commissioner of Ins. </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Acc. Co., </em>318 Mass. 238, 241 (1945). Moreover, the punitive effect of \u00a7 6F serves to discourage insubstantial and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>frivolous actions. See <em>Waldman </em>v. <em>American Honda Motor Co., supra </em>at 324 n.10; <em>Brookline </em>v. <em>Goldstein, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b349-5\">Cases decided under \u00a7 6F have treated the statute\u2019s purpose sympathetically in order that its policies may be effectuated. <em>Brookline </em>v. <em>Goldstein, supra. </em>This court has applied \u00a7 6F in awarding appellate attorney\u2019s fees incurred in defending against frivolous appeals. <em>Hahn </em>v. <em>Planning Bd. of Stoughton, </em>403 Mass. 332, 334, 338-339 (1988), <em>S.C., </em>406 Mass. 1001, 1002 (1989). See <em>Ashford </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Bay Transp. Auth., </em>421 Mass. 563, 568-569 (1995) (reminding litigants that improper appeals may result in sanctions under G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 6F); <em>Pollack </em>v. <em>Kelly, </em>372 Mass. 469, 477 &amp; n.5 (1977) (reminding litigants that G. L. c. 231, \u00a7\u00a7 6E-6G, provide a basis for sanctions for \u201ccontinued use of . . . delaying tactics in the face of settled law against the presentation of interlocutory appeals\u201d). Furthermore \u00a7\u00a7 6E-6G specifically include the Appeals Court within the ambit of the statute. See G. L. c. 231, \u00a7\u00a7 6E-6G. Thus, the cryptic conclusion of the Appeals Court that \u201cGeneral Laws c. 231, 6F, does not apply to a judgment of the Appeals Court\u201d was erroneous. See, e.g., <em>Worcester </em>v. <em>O\u2019Keefe, </em>36 Mass. App. Ct. 1109, 1109 (1994) (\u201cThe defendant\u2019s motion for attorney\u2019s fees incurred in his appeal to this court is allowed, the amount to be determined upon application to a single justice of the court. G. L. c. 231, \u00a7\u00a7 6F, 6G\u201d); <em>Matter of a Grand Jury Subpoena, </em>30 Mass. App. Ct. 462, 466 (1991) (\u201cwe conclude that [a party\u2019s] appeal is not so wholly insubstantial as to warrant the imposition of sanctions under G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 6F\u201d); <em>Strand </em>v. <em>Hubbard, </em>27 Mass. App. Ct. 684, 688 (1989) (\u201c[t]he appellate court may, of course, make a determination that the appeal meets the criteria of [G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 6F] and order counsel fees to be determined in the trial court\u201d); <em>Cohen </em>v. <em>Hurley, </em>20 Mass. App. Ct. 439, 441 &amp; n.2 (1985) (where appeal to single justice was frivolous, single justice had power to award party opposing appeal costs and fees pursuant to Mass. R. A. R 25, and G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 6F).</p>\n<p id=\"b349-6\">The Appeals Court has already rejected the plaintiff\u2019s motion under G. L. c. 211 A, \u00a7 15, and Mass. R. A. P. 25, as a matter of discretion and no appeal from that decision is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>properly before us.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> We point out, however, that there is a significant difference between G. L. c. 231,. \u00a7 6F, on the one hand, and G. L. c. 211 A, \u00a7 15, and Mass. R. A. P. 25 on the other. The former statute grants a court discretion to determine whether the appeal is wholly insubstantial, frivolous, or not advanced in good faith. If that discretionary finding is made, however, the statute mandates the award of reasonable counsel fees and other costs and expenses. Rule 25 and c. 211 A, \u00a7 15, on the other hand, grant a court discretion in the award of fees and costs even if it determines that the appeal was frivolous. Because the Appeals Court\u2019s decision was based on the assumption that G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 6F, did not apply, we cannot assume that it exercised its discretion as mandated by that statute. That is especially so when it does not appear on the record before us that there was a substantial basis for appealing from the judgment of the District Court and even less for applying for further appellate review.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b350-5\"><em>The contract appeal. </em>In claiming its appeal under G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 6G, the plaintiff attempted to include an appeal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>from the denial of its claim for attorney\u2019s fees under the contract. This was a procedural misstep because G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 6G, which authorizes an appeal to this court from the denial by the Appeals Court of a motion for counsel fees and other costs, is specifically limited to appeals arising rmder \u00a7 6F. See note 11, <em>supra. </em>In order for the contract claim to be properly before this court, it would have been necessary for the plaintiff to have filed and have granted an application for further appellate review. See Mass. R. A. P. 27.1 (a), as amended, 367 Mass. 920 (1975). Because this procedural nuance has never before been decided and because the motion must be reheard in the Appeals Court, it would be a proper exercise of that court\u2019s discretion to hear the plaintiff\u2019s claim for attorney\u2019s fees and other costs of appeal arising under the contract because that claim has never been adjudicated on the merits.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b351-5\">This case is remanded to the Appeals Court or to a single justice thereof for a determination, after a hearing, whether the plaintiff is entitled to attorney\u2019s fees and other costs of its appeal pursuant to G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 6F, and for other proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b346-8\">General Laws c. 142A, \u00a7 4 <em>(e) </em>states: \u201cA contractor, subcontractor or homeowner may . . . appeal the decision of an arbitrator for a trial de novo in superior court or district court. Such appeal must be filed within twenty-one days from the issuance of such findings and shall stay any work or payment to the owner, contractor or subcontractor.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b346-9\">The plaintiff, however, argues that the counterclaim containing the appeal was not even mailed to the plaintiff by December 10, 1993. In support of its argument, the plaintiff points out that the envelope received by the plaintiff\u2019s counsel is postmarked December 13, 1993. The defendants argue that the counterclaim was mailed on December 10, 1993, to the plaintiff\u2019s counsel and a copy of the counterclaim was hand delivered to the court on December 13, 1993.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b346-10\">General Laws c. 211A, \u00a7 15, provides: \u201cIf, upon the hearing of an appeal or exceptions in any proceeding, it appears that the appeal or exceptions are frivolous, immaterial or intended for delay, the appeals court may, either upon motion of a party or on its own motion, award against the appellant or excepting party double costs from the time when the appeal was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>taken or the exceptions were allowed, and also interest from the same time at the rate of twelve per cent a year on any amount which has been found due for debt and damages, or which he has been ordered to pay, or for which judgment has been recovered against him, or may award any part of such additional costs and interest.\u2019\u2019</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b347-11\">Rule 25 of the Massachusetts Rules of Appellate Procedure, as amended, 378 Mass. 925 (1979), provides: \u201cIf the appellate court shall determine that an appeal is frivolous, it may award just damages and single or double costs to the appellee, and such interest on the amount of the judgment as may be allowed by law.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b347-12\">At oral argument it was made clear that the plaintiff seeks only reimbursement for the attorney\u2019s fees incurred while defending against the defendants\u2019 appeal. No attorney\u2019s fees are sought for the time spent preparing for and going through the arbitration proceeding.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b347-13\">The contract provided in pertinent part: \u201cIn the event that Owner wrongfully fails to make payment for work not in dispute in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, then Contractor shall be entitled to collect reasonable attorney\u2019s fees and other costs of collection incurred in collecting such payments.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b347-14\">The Appeals Court order also stated: \u201cThe award of legal fees under Mass. R. [A.] P. 25, and costs under G. L. c. 211A, \u00a7 15, are matters of discretion and a denial of legal fees and costs requires no explanation. Any rights under the contract were matters for the arbitrator.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b347-15\">General Laws c. 231, \u00a7 6G, provides in pertinent part: \u201cAny party may file a notice of appeal with the clerk or register of the court hearing the motion within ten days after receiving notice of the decision thereon. The clerk or register shall then forward the motion, the court\u2019s findings and award, and any other documents relevant to the appeal to the clerk of the court deciding the appeal who, upon receipt thereof, shall refer the matter <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>to the court for speedy decision and shall notify the parties of such decision, which shall be final.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b348-7\">General Laws c. 231, \u00a7 6F, provides: \u201cUpon motion of any party in any civil action in which a finding, verdict, decision, award, order or judgment has been made by a judge or justice or by a jury, auditor, master or other finder of fact, the court may determine, after a hearing, as a separate and distinct finding, that all or substantially all of the claims, defenses, setoffs, or counterclaims, whether of a factual, legal or mixed nature, made by any party who was represented by counsel during most or all of the proceeding, were wholly insubstantial, frivolous and not advanced in good faith. The court shall include in such finding the specific facts and reasons on which the finding is based.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b348-8\">\u201cIf such a finding is made with respect to a party\u2019s claims, the court shall award to each party against whom such claims were asserted an amount representing the reasonable counsel fees and other costs and expenses incurred in defending against such claims.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b350-6\">The plaintiff attempted to appeal from the denial of its motion for attorney\u2019s fees under Mass. R. A. R 25 and G. L. c. 211A, \u00a7 15, by filing a notice of appeal. A notice of appeal, however, is proper only when an appeal is permitted by law. Mass. R. A. R 3 (a), as amended, 378 Mass. 927 (1979). General Laws c. 231, \u00a7 6G, authorizes appeals to this court from decisions rendered under G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 6R Thus, an appeal from the denial of the plaintiff\u2019s motion under Mass. R. A. R 25 and G. L. c. 211A, \u00a7 15, is not permitted under \u00a7 6G.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-7\">A party aggrieved by the award of costs by the Appeals Court under G. L. c. 211 A, \u00a7 15, and Mass. R. A. P. 25 may seek review in this court by applying for further appellate review. <em>Avery </em>v. <em>Steele, </em>414 Mass. 450, 451 (1993). An appeal from the denial of such a motion should follow the same course. The determination whether an appeal is frivolous is left to the sound discretion of the appellate court, <em>id. </em>at 455; therefore, the only issue on appeal to this court is whether the Appeals Court abused its discretion. The plaintiff argues the frivolousness issue before us but makes no claim that the Appeals Court abused its discretion. Therefore, even if it had properly claimed an appeal, the only viable issue was waived. Mass. R. A. P. 16 (a) (4), as amended, 367 Mass. 921 (1975). See <em>Maillet </em>v. <em>ATF-Davidson Co., </em>407 Mass. 185, 194 (1990).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b350-8\">We note that \u00a7 6F requires a hearing and that after the hearing, certain factual disputes, such as whether the defendants mailed their claim on December 10, 1996, must be resolved. Certainly an appeal founded on a misrepresentation of such a crucial fact would be insubstantial, frivolous, and in bad faith under G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 6F.
