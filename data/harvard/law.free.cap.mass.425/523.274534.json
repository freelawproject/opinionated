Dowling, m, was convicted in New Hampshire of driving while under the influence of alcohol. As a result, his right to operate a motor vehicle in that State was suspended for one year. At the time of his conviction, Dowling held a valid Massachusetts driver\u2019s license. On January 29, 1996, the defendant registrar of motor vehicles (registrar) was officially notified of Dowling\u2019s conviction in New Hampshire and of the one-year suspension of his right to operate a motor vehicle in that State. The registrar suspended Dowling\u2019s Massachusetts license for one year.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>Dowling appealed to the defendant board of appeal on motor vehicle liability policies and bonds (board). After a hearing, the board affirmed the registrar\u2019s action. Dowling then sought review of the board\u2019s decision in the Superior Court pursuant to G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14 (7). A judge in that court concluded that the registrar\u2019s suspension of the plaintiff\u2019s driver\u2019s license for one year was contrary to G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 22 (c). He reversed the board\u2019s decision and ordered that the suspension not exceed ninety days. The defendants appealed to the Appeals Court and we transferred the case to this court on our own initiative.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-5\">The first paragraph of G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 22 (c), provides as follows: \u201cIf the registrar receives official notice . . . that a resident of the commonwealth or any person licensed to operate a motor vehicle under the provisions of this chapter has been convicted in another state or country of a motor vehicle violation, the registrar shall give the same effect to said conviction for the purposes of suspension, revocation, limitation or reinstatement of tiie right to operate a motor vehicle, as if said violation had occurred in the commonwealth.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b544-6\">The third paragraph of c. 90, \u00a7 22 (c), provides: \u201cIf the registrar receives official notice . . . that a resident of the commonwealth, or any person licensed to operate a motor vehicle under the provisions of chapter ninety, or any applicant therefor has had a license or right to operate suspended or revoked in another state or country, the registrar shall not issue a license to said person, and if a license has already been issued the registrar shall immediately revoke said license, without a prior hearing. However, if said license or right to operate is subsequently reinstated by such other state or country, the person may apply to the registrar for reinstatement of said license in the commonwealth.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b544-7\">The registrar received official notice of two events: (1) the plaintiff had been convicted of a motor vehicle violation, and (2) the plaintiff\u2019s right to operate a motor vehicle in New Hampshire had been suspended for one year. The question before us is whether the registrar should have ordered the same suspension of the plaintiff\u2019s license as would have been appropriate if the conviction had occurred in Massachusetts, as the plaintiff contends and as the first paragraph of \u00a7 22 (c), if it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>stood alone, would seem to require,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> or instead was correct in ordering a one-year suspension in keeping with the suspension imposed in New Hampshire, as the defendants contend was proper and as the third paragraph of \u00a7 22 (c), if it stood alone, would appear to mandate.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-5\">We must interpret G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 22 (c), \u201caccording to the intent of the Legislature ascertained from all its words construed by the ordinary and approved usage of the language, considered in connection with the cause of its enactment, the mischief or imperfection to be remedied and the main object to be accomplished.\u201d <em>Registrar of Motor Vehicles </em>v. <em>Board of Appeal on Motor Vehicle Liab. Policies &amp; Bonds, </em>382 Mass. 580, 585 (1981), quoting <em>Board of Educ. </em>v. <em>Assessor of Worcester, </em>368 Mass. 511, 513 (1975). Where two statutory provisions relate to the same subject matter, as do the first and third paragraphs of G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 22 (c), whenever it is reasonably possible \u201cthey should be construed together so as to constitute an harmonious whole consistent with the legislative purpose.\u201d <em>Registrar of Motor Vehicles </em>v. <em>Board of Appeal on Motor Vehicle Liab. Policies &amp; Bonds, supra. </em>We are satisfied that the two paragraphs in question can be harmoniously construed in a manner that is consistent with the legislative purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-6\">\u201cThe duty of statutory interpretation is for the courts . . . but an administrative agency\u2019s interpretation of a statute within its charge is accorded weight and deference. . . . Where the [agency\u2019s] statutory interpretation is reasonable . . . the court should not supplant [its] judgment.\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>Massachusetts Medical Soc\u2019y </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Ins., </em>402 Mass. 44, 62 (1988). According to the registrar and the board, both rules contained in the first and third paragraphs of G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 22 (c), apply when a Massachusetts resident or license holder\u2019s license or right to operate has been suspended or revoked in another State as a result of a conviction for a motor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>vehicle violation. In effect, this means that the rule of the first paragraph will govern when the suspension provided by Massachusetts law is longer than the suspension imposed by the sister State, and the rule of the third paragraph will govern when the suspension imposed by the sister State is longer than that provided by Massachusetts law. The registrar\u2019s construction of G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 22 (c), is reasonable and reflects the history of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-5\">Accompanying his submission to the General Court of House Bill No. 879, which became \u00a7 22 (c) of G. L. c. 90, the Governor included a statement referring the Legislature to an incident in which a \u201cman [was] arrested for his twelfth drunk driving charge in Massachusetts. Despite having had his Massachusetts license revoked, he had obtained a New Hampshire license.\u201d 1990 House Doc. No. 879, at 2. The Governor\u2019s statement suggests that House Bill No. 879 was intended to prevent an individual from retaining or obtaining a license in one State while his or her license or right to operate is suspended or revoked in another State. Were we to adopt the plaintiff\u2019s construction of G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 22 <em>(c), </em>a Massachusetts licensee could retain his or her license and right to operate in forty-nine States during a period in which his or her right to operate in one State has been suspended or revoked as a consequence of a motor vehicle offense which occurred in that State. That would be the result in the present case if we were to subscribe to the plaintiff\u2019s interpretation of the statute. Similarly, the plaintiff\u2019s construction would permit an individual, whose license is under suspension in the State in which he was convicted of a motor vehicle violation, to obtain a driver\u2019s license in Massachusetts if the conviction would have resulted in a shorter period of suspension in Massachusetts than in the State where the violation occurred. Clearly, such a construction would be contrary to the objective of the statute. The defendants\u2019 construction of the statute, however, serves its objective. It makes it impossible for an individual who has lost his or her driver\u2019s license or right to operate a motor vehicle in one State as a result of a conviction of a motor vehicle violation or otherwise to retain or obtain a license in Massachusetts while the suspension or revocation in the State where the offense occurred remains in effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-6\">We further conclude that this construction of \u00a7 22 (c) is in accord with the objectives of G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 30B, the \u201cinterstate compact for reporting motor vehicle convictions.\u201d In <em>Matter of </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number><em>Johnson, </em>226 N.J. Super. 1, 6 (1988), a New Jersey court examined the primary objectives of the interstate compact. The court relied heavily on a document entitled \u201cThe Driver License Compact,\u201d issued by the Secretariat of the American Association of Motor Vehicle Administrators, which describes the purposes of the compact. <em>Id. </em>According to the document, one of the compact\u2019s objectives is to \u201ckeep drivers ... if under suspension or revocation, from displaying a license certificate from a jurisdiction other than the one which has issued the suspension order.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b547-5\">General Laws c. 90, \u00a7 22 (c), \u201cis to be interpreted in the light of its purpose and, so far as may be, to promote the accomplishment of its beneficent design.\u201d <em>Automobile Insurers Bur. of Mass. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Ins., ante </em>262, 267 (1997), quoting <em>Neff </em>v. <em>Commissioner of the Dep\u2019t of Indus. Accidents, </em>421 Mass. 70, 73 (1995). Considering the \u201cmischief or imperfection to be remedied [by the statute],\u201d <em>Registrar of Motor Vehicles, supra </em>at 585, we conclude that the defendants\u2019 interpretation is correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-6\">The Superior Court judgment is reversed and the board\u2019s decision is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b545-7\">The plaintiff had no prior convictions for driving under the influence of alcohol and enrolled in a driver alcohol education program. Under G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 24 (1) (c) (1), the registrar is required to suspend for one year the license of any individual convicted of driving under the influence of alcohol, first offense, in Massachusetts. However, under G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 24D, if the individual consents, as the plaintiff did, he or she may be placed on probation for not more than two years and may be assigned to a driver alcohol education program. The driver\u2019s license of a person who consents to enrollment in a driver alcohol education program will, under G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 24D, be suspended by the court for not less than forty-five nor more than ninety days.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
