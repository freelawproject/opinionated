(New Hope), a counselling center for victims of domestic violence and shelter <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>for battered women. On motion of the defendant, who is charged with rape, armed assault in a dwelling, and violation of an order issued pursuant to G. L. c. 209A, another judge in that court had ordered that New Hope produce the counselling records of the alleged victim for an in camera inspection for exculpatory evidence. New Hope declined to comply with that order which had been entered pursuant to G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 20K, inserted by St. 1986, c. 492 (\u00a7 20K). The judge who entered the contempt order stayed the judgment pending appeal. We transferred New Hope\u2019s appeal here on our own motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-5\">Section 20K, whose substantive provisions are set forth in the margin,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> states that, \u201c[a] domestic violence victims\u2019 counselor shall not disclose [a] confidential communication without the prior written consent of the victim, except as' hereinafter provided.\u201d A confidential communication of a victim is not subject to discovery in any civil, legislative, or administrative proceeding without the written consent of the victim. In a criminal proceeding, a confidential communication is \u201csubject to discovery and shall be admissible as evidence but only to the extent of information contained therein which is exculpatory in relation to the defendant,\u201d and only after a judge shall have examined the confidential communication and determined that the communication contains exculpatory information.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-6\">Last year, we decided <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fuller, </em>423 Mass. 216 (1996), which concerned the attempt of a criminal defendant to obtain from a sexual assault counsellor information that was protected by the privilege prescribed by G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 20J. We referred to the procedures that this court had established in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number><em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bishop, </em>416 Mass. 169 (1993), which are to be applied \u201cwhen a defendant seeks access to any privileged records, including those protected by \u00a7 20J.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fuller, supra </em>at 224. In our <em>Fuller </em>opinion, we undertook to set forth a better standard and to prescribe better procedures than we had in our <em>Bishop </em>opinion to be used when an alleged victim\u2019s privacy concerns must be balanced against a defendant\u2019s asserted needs for exculpatory information. <em>Id. </em>at 225. We said that we did not want a standard that \u201cwould result in virtually automatic in camera inspection for an entire class of extremely private and sensitive privileged material.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 224. We, therefore, required that, before a judge should undertake an in camera review of privileged records, the defendant must demonstrate a good faith, specific, and reasonable basis for believing that the records will contain exculpatory evidence that is relevant and material to the defendant\u2019s guilt. <em>Id. </em>at 226.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-5\">The judge who issued the 1995 order to New Hope to produce the alleged victim\u2019s records did not have the benefit of our opinion in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fuller, supra, </em>and understandably the standard that this court established in that case for the production of privileged information was not applied. We conclude that the nature of the statutory privilege established by \u00a7 20K, whatever constitutional right to privacy, if any, that may be involved, and the character of the records being sought are not significantly different from the privilege, any right to privacy, and the character of the records involved in a G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 20J, request. The <em>Bishop-Fuller </em>procedures, therefore, should be followed when a defendant requests information protected by \u00a7 20K. Such a practice would satisfy a defendant\u2019s right to due process of law <em>(Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fuller, supra </em>at 227), and, as far as we can discern on the limited record before us, would not impermissibly intrude on whatever constitutionally protected right of confidentiality, if any, that the alleged victim may have <em>(id. </em>at 223). We continue to see whatever right to confidentiality in a criminal proceeding that an alleged victim may have as being subject to the balancing of the defendant\u2019s rights and the alleged victim\u2019s rights that we discussed in our <em>Fuller </em>opinion. <em>Id. </em>at 223.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-6\">We, therefore, direct that the judgment of contempt be vacated, that the order for production of the alleged victim\u2019s records be vacated, and that, on a new motion of the defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>for production, the <em>Bishop-Fuller </em>procedures should be followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-5\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b508-7\">The last paragraph of \u00a7 20K reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b508-8\">\u201cA domestic violence victims\u2019 counselor shall not disclose such confidential communication without the prior written consent of the victim, except as hereinafter provided. Such confidential communication shall not be subject to discovery in any civil, legislative or administrative proceeding without the prior written consent of the victim to whom such confidential communication relates. In criminal actions such confidential communication shall be subject to discovery and shall be admissible as evidence but only to the extent of information contained therein which is exculpatory in relation to the defendant; provided, however, that the court shall first examine such confidential communication and shall determine whether or not such exculpatory information is therein contained before allowing such discovery or the introduction of such evidence.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b508-9\">Section 20K also defines \u201c[ajbuse,\u201d \u201c[cjonfidential communication,\u201d \u201c[djomestic violence victims\u2019 counselor,\u201d \u201c[djomestic violence victims\u2019 program,\u201d and \u201c[vjictim.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
