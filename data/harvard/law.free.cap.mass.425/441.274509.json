Mahoney (wife) appealed from a judgment of divorce issued by a Probate and Family Court judge on March 15, 1994. She claims that the judge did not include as a marital asset, as he should have, the value of anticipated Social Security old age benefits of her husband, Daniel F. Mahoney (husband), for the purpose of dividing the marital estate pursuant to G. L. c. 208, \u00a7 34. She also argues that the judge overlooked other assets that should have been, but were not, included in the marital assets, and overstated certain debt assumed by her husband. We transferred the case to this court on our own motion. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>We affirm the judgment in part, reverse in part, and remand the case to the Probate Court for entry of an amended judgment consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-5\">1. In December, 1991, the husband filed a complaint for divorce in the Worcester Division of the Probate and Family Court Department. The trial commenced on June 1, 1993, and on December 14, 1993, the judge granted a judgment of divorce nisi, which was made absolute on March 15, 1994. The wife filed a notice of appeal dated January 12, 1994, with respect to certain portions of the judgment that applied to the division of marital property. On December 28, 1995, the judge issued his \u201cfindings of facts and rationale of judgment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b462-6\">The judge included future payments from the wife\u2019s retirement plan as a part of the divisible marital estate; her retirement plan contributions had accrued during the course of the marriage.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> He found that the wife\u2019s contributions to her retirement plan totalled approximately $32,000, and that she was eligible for retirement after September 4, 1993, on completion of twenty years of service. The judge found that the then present value of the wife\u2019s future retirement plan benefits, at the age of sixty, was $83,000.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b462-7\">The judge found that the husband would be entitled to receive Social Security old age benefits,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> but concluded that, under Federal law, such benefits are not a divisible marital asset. The judge nevertheless concluded that, in order to provide for an equitable division of the marital estate, \u201cthe award of a larger overall percentage of the estate to the Wife was necessary to equalize the standard of living both parties will enjoy in the present and future.\u201d After evaluating the total marital estate at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>$311,833, the judge awarded $169,698 of the net marital assets (58%) to the wife and $122,135 (42%) to the husband.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-5\">The wife argues that the judge erred by failing to offset the husband\u2019s future interest in Social Security old age benefits against her future retirement plan benefits. We disagree. As to inclusion of the wife\u2019s future retirement plan benefits in the marital assets, G. L. c. 208, \u00a7 34, confers broad discretion on a judge to make an equitable property division in connection with a divorce. <em>Early </em>v. <em>Early, </em>413 Mass. 720, 727 (1992), and cases cited. The statute provides that, when dividing the marital estate, a judge may include as part of the marital estate any vested and nonvested retirement (including pension) benefits of either spouse. G. L. c. 208, \u00a7 34. See <em>Early, supra </em>at 723; <em>Moriarty </em>v. <em>Stone, </em>41 Mass. App. Ct. 151, 156 (1996) (retirement benefits accrued before marriage may be included as marital assets); <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>22 Mass. App. Ct. 955, 956 (1986). It was proper for the judge to include the wife\u2019s future retirement plan benefits as a marital asset.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-6\">As to any Social Security old age benefits that the husband anticipates, the judge was correct to conclude that Federal law prohibits such benefits from being included as an asset in the marital estate. Title 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 407(a) (1994) provides that \u201c[t]he right of any person to any future payment . . . shall not be transferable or assignable, at law or in equity, and none of the moneys paid or payable or rights existing . . . shall be subject to execution, levy, attachment, garnishment, or other legal process . . . .\u201d While 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 659(a) permits the assignment of Social Security monies to pay for alimony and child support,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>explicitly excludes for the purposes of the statute \u201cany payment or transfer of property or its value by an individual to his spouse or former spouse in compliance with any community property settlement, equitable distribution of property, or other division of property between spouses or former spouses.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 659(i)(3)(B)(ii).</p>\n<p id=\"b464-5\">Because there is an important difference between pensions and Social Security benefits, it is appropriate for a judge to treat public or private pension funds differently from Social Security old age benefits for the purposes of marital property distribution. An employee who participates in a pension plan has an enforceable contractual right to receive future benefits from the plan. Social Security old age benefits, however, \u201care not deferred compensation for services rendered but rather a governmental safety net for the retired,\u201d and as such, \u201c[t]he employee has no contractual right to such benefits.\u201d <em>Cox </em>v. <em>Cox, </em>882 P.2d 909, 920 (Alaska 1994), <em>S.C., </em>931 P.2d 1041 (Alaska 1997), citing <em>Mann </em>v. <em>Mann, </em>778 P2d 590, 592 (Alaska 1989). See <em>Hisquierdo </em>v. <em>Hisquierdo, </em>439 U.S. 572, 575 (1979) (observing that \u201c[ljike Social Security, and unlike most private pension plans, railroad retirement benefits are not contractual\u201d). Anticipated Social Security old age benefits are indefinite because Congress may alter, amend, or repeal any provision of the Social Security Act at any time. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1304 (1994). See <em>Flemming </em>v. <em>Nestor, </em>363 U.S. 603, 617 (1960) (Congress may deny \u201cnoncontractual governmental benefit\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b464-6\">The wife urges us to construe narrowly the Supreme Court\u2019s holding in <em>Hisquierdo </em>to apply only to benefits governed by the Federal Railroad Retirement Act, 45 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 231-23It. In particular, she focuses on the language of 45 U.S.C. \u00a7 231m that precludes the anticipation of retirement benefits<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>; in contrast, she argues, the Social Security Act\u2019s antiassignment provision, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 407, includes no language addressing \u201canticipated\u201d benefits. Thus, she argues, a court may anticipate a spouse\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>future Social Security benefits and include them in the marital estate for equitable distribution. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-5\">First, we observe that in <em>Hisquierdo, </em>the Supreme Court analogized the Railroad Retirement Act benefits at issue to those administered by the Social Security Administration, discussing the alimony and child support exceptions to the antiassignment rule, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 659 (1994), and the exclusion of property distribution from these exceptions, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 662.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>Hisquierdo, supra </em>at 587.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In addition, we are reluctant to permit the inclusion of anticipated Social Security old age benefits as part of the marital estate because Congress has expressed an intent to preempt this entire area of law. The Social Security Act provides disability and old age benefits for divorced spouses (here the wife) on the basis of the spouse\u2019s Social Security insurance when the covered spouse (here the husband) begins collecting retirement or disability benefits, provided that the divorced person is at least sixty-two years old, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 402(b)(1)(B) and (c)(1)(B); has not remarried, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 402(b)(1)(C) and (c)(1)(C); and was married to the covered spouse for at least ten years before the divorce, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 416(d)(l)-(2).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> See C.P. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>Kindregan, Jr. &amp; M.L. Inker, Family Law and Practice \u00a7 41.18, at 96 (2d ed. 1996); <em>In re the Marriage of Boyer, </em>538 N.W.2d 293, 295 (Iowa 1995); <em>Matter of the Marriage of Swan, </em>301 Or. 167, 176-177 (1986). See also <em>Richard </em>v. <em>Richard, </em>659 S.W.2d 746, 749 (Tex. Ct. App. 1983) (\u201cAdditional reasoning indicating Congressional intent to preempt state community property is shown by the fact that Congress expressly provides in 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 402[b][l] for certain benefits for divorced spouses so that a divorced spouse would not have to depend upon a state\u2019s system of marital property law\u201d). Decisions by State courts in this area that may differ in outcome would disrupt a uniform Federal scheme of benefits and would produce results that would vary from State to State. <em>In re the Marriage of Kelley, </em>64 Cal. App. 3d 82, 99 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b466-5\">The wife relies on decisions from other jurisdictions in support of her argument. See, e.g., <em>In re Marriage of Brane, </em>21 Kan. App. 2d 778 (1995); <em>Pongonis </em>v. <em>Pongonis, </em>606 A.2d 1055, 1058 (Me. 1992); <em>Matter of the Marriage of Knipp, </em>809 P.2d 562, 564 (Kan. 1991); <em>Rudden </em>v. <em>Rudden, </em>765 S.W.2d 719, 720 (Mo. Ct. App. 1989). But each of those decisions affirms the majority view, which we join, that anticipated Social Security old age benefits may not be included as part of the marital estate. Those cases do hold, however, that a judge may consider a spouse\u2019s anticipated Social Security benefits as one factor, among others, in making an equitable distribution of the distributable marital assets. In this case the judge did precisely that; he considered the husband\u2019s anticipated Social Security old age benefits, and awarded the wife a larger percentage of the marital estate \u201cto equalize the standard of living both parties will enjoy in the present and future.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> We conclude that the judge acted correctly. There is no requirement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>as to precisely how a judge must consider anticipated Social Security benefits; based on the record in this case we conclude that the judge was not plainly wrong. <em>Rice </em>v. <em>Rice, </em>372 Mass. 398, 402 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b467-5\">The wife challenges three other findings of the judge. She claims that the judge erred by not including the husband\u2019s automobile as a marital asset, and by not counting as part of the marital estate monies the husband withdrew from the couple\u2019s home equity and savings accounts prior to the divorce. She also argues that the judge incorrectly undervalued the equity in a vacation home owned jointly by the couple.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-6\">We review a trial judge\u2019s distribution of marital assets by employing a two-step analysis. First, we examine the judge\u2019s findings to determine whether he considered all relevant factors enumerated in G. L. c. 208, \u00a7 34. We then determine whether the reasons for the judge\u2019s conclusions are apparent in his findings and rulings, with the judge\u2019s rationale apparent in the judgment. <em>Bowring </em>v. <em>Reid, </em>399 Mass. 265, 267 (1987). We shall not reverse a judgment of property division unless \u201cplainly wrong and excessive.\u201d <em>Id., </em>quoting <em>Redding </em>v. <em>Redding, </em>398 Mass. 102, 107 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b467-7\">Using that analysis, we conclude that the judge was correct to exclude the value of the husband\u2019s automobile as part of the marital estate; the judge found that the husband had sold his automobile and applied the proceeds of the sale to improve the vacation house owned by the couple. The latter was included as a marital asset. The judge also found that the husband had withdrawn funds from the couple\u2019s savings account; he correctly credited this amount to the husband when dividing the estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-8\">As to the vacation home, the judge recognized that the husband had withdrawn money from a home equity loan account for which the vacation home was collateral; he concluded that these funds had been used for family purposes. However, for purposes of calculating the marital assets, the judge valued the vacation home by subtracting from the property\u2019s fair market value (agreed to by both parties) the full amount of the available home equity line of credit ($15,000) rather than the amount actually borrowed by the husband on that line of credit ($7,265). Because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>the amount borrowed was less than the total loan amount available, we conclude that the judge undervalued the equity of the home by $7,735.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-5\">The judgment of the Probate and Family Court is affirmed in part and reversed in part. We remand the case for a recalculation of the marital assets and amendment of the judgment consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b462-8\">At the time of the trial, the wife had been employed as a teacher at the Worcester Vocational High School for almost twenty years, earning a yearly salary of $38,000. She participates in a retirement plan through the Massachusetts teachers retirement fund.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b462-9\">For purposes of calculating the present value of the wife\u2019s retirement plan benefits, the judge assumed that the wife would terminate her employment as of January 22, 1993, and would make no further contributions to the plan.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b462-10\">At the time of trial, the husband (who was then earning approximately $50,000 a year) was not eligible to receive any Social Security benefits. The judge made no finding as to any lump-sum present value of the husband\u2019s future anticipated Social Security benefits; he did find that if the husband continued to earn approximately $55,000 each year until retirement, his anticipated monthly payment from Social Security benefits would be $1,115 per month, assuming retirement at the age of sixty-two.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b463-7\">Title 42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 659(a), as amended, Pub.

L. 104-193, tit. III, \u00a7 362(a), 110 Stat. 2245; the exclusion of property distribution from the alimony exception to the antiassigment rule was codified at 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 659(i)(3)(B)(ii).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b465-12\">In response to <em>Hisquierdo </em>v. <em>Hisquierdo, </em>439 U.S. 572 (1979), Congress amended 45 U.S.C. \u00a7 231m in 1983 to allow courts to anticipate supplemental railroad retirement benefits in order to distribute property in accordance with court-ordered property settlements pursuant to divorce. Pub. L. 98-76, tit. IV, \u00a7 419(a)(3), 97 Stat. 938 (1983). That same year Congress also amended 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 407(b), the Social Security Act\u2019s antiassignment provision, to provide that \u201c[n]o other provision of law, enacted before, on, or after April 20, 1983, may be construed to limit, supersede, or otherwise modify the provisions of this section except to the extent that it does so by express reference to this section.\u201d In response to these amendments, one court has noted, Pub.

We decline to adopt this approach. In <em>Cohen </em>v. <em>Murphy, </em>368 Mass. 144 (1975), decided before <em>Hisquierdo, </em>we anticipated a Federal exemption argument that veterans\u2019 benefits could not be used to calculate the amount of support to be ordered against the benefits\u2019 recipient in support proceedings.
