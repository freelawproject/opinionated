The trustee of four corporate trusts (trusts) appealed from a decision of the Appellate Tax Board (board) upholding the Commissioner of Revenue\u2019s (commissioner\u2019s) determination that the trusts were not entitled to an abatement for alleged overpayment of capital gains taxes. The Appeals Court reversed the board\u2019s decision on the ground that property held <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>in a corporate trust is entitled to a step-up in basis when shares pass from a decedent. See <em>Minkin </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Revenue, </em>40 Mass. App. Ct. 345 (1996). We granted the commissioner\u2019s application for further appellate review. We affirm the decision of the board.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-5\">1. <em>Background.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b195-6\">A. <em>Facts. </em>The parties stipulated to the following facts. Isadore Minkin (decedent) and his wife, Gladys S. Minkin, acquired four properties and placed them in separate corporate trusts. See G. L. c. 62, \u00a7 1 <em>(j).</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>The trusts engaged in the business of owning and renting real estate. The decedent and his wife were the sole trustees and each owned one-half of the transferable shares. The trusts were treated as corporations for both Federal and State tax purposes.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b195-7\">On January 14, 1983, the decedent died and his wife inherited his interests. The decedent\u2019s estate used the fair market value of the trusts\u2019 property to value his shares and paid estate taxes accordingly. In December, 1983, the trustee adopted a complete plan of liquidation and sold the trusts\u2019 property. Because the trusts were treated as corporations for Federal tax purposes, no gain or loss was recognized on this sale for Federal tax purposes. I.R.C. \u00a7 337.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> For State tax purposes, the nonrecognition provision of \u00a7 337 does not ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>ply to corporate trusts. See <em>Commissioner of Revenue </em>v. <em>Shafner, </em>392 Mass. 256, 258 (1984) (\u00a7 337 only applies to corporations). The trusts must recognize a capital gain on the sale of property; the amount depends on whether the trusts\u2019 bases in the property should be stepped-up.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-5\">B. <em>Section 1014 of the Internal Revenue Code. </em>Basis is the starting point for determining gain or loss on the sale of property. In general, basis reflects the taxpayer\u2019s cost, adjusted as required for improvements and depreciation. I.R.C. \u00a7 1012. There is an exception to this rule when the property owner dies. Pursuant to \u00a7 1014, the basis of property \u201cacquir[ed]\u201d or deemed to pass from a decedent is \u201cthe fair market value of the property at the date of the decedent\u2019s death.\u201d I.R.C. \u00a7 1014 (a).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The basis of the property in the transferee\u2019s hands is \u201cstepped-up\u201d or \u201cdown,\u201d thereby erasing unrealized capital gains or losses accrued while the decedent held the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-6\">\u201cThe purpose of section 1014 is, in general, to provide a basis for property acquired from a decedent which is equal to the value placed upon such property for purposes of the Federal estate tax.\u201d 26 C.F.R. \u00a7 1.1014-1 (1996). Section 1014(b) lists ten specific situations in which a taxpayer is considered to have acquired property from a decedent or in which the property is deemed to have passed from the decedent. The relevant provisions are set out in the margin.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Property acquired from a decedent includes, principally, prop<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>erty transferred by bequest, devise, or inheritance, and property required to be included in determining the fair market value of the decedent\u2019s gross estate under the relevant provisions of the I.R.C. 26 C.F.R. \u00a7 1.1014-1. Thus, for example, a stepped-up basis is applied to property passing by will or intestacy, revocable or alterable trusts, or transfers under appointment. I.R.C. \u00a7 1014(b). 26 C.F.R. \u00a7 1.1014-2 (1996). The property must fit into one of the categories listed in \u00a7 1014(b) to fall within the purview of \u00a7 1014(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b197-5\">These well-established principles of Federal tax law were incorporated into the Massachusetts tax statutes under G. L. c. 62, \u00a7 6F.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> With this background in mind, we turn to the issue on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-6\">2. <em>Discussion. </em>The basis of the shares passed from the decedent to the remaining shareholder was stepped-up to the 1983 fair market value. I.R.C. \u00a7 1014. Had the beneficiary sold her inherited shares in the trusts at the 1983 fair market value, she would not have realized a capital gain on the stepped-up shares. Instead, the trusts were liquidated and the proceeds were distributed to the remaining shareholder.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-7\">For State tax purposes, the trusts recognized a gain when their property was liquidated. G. L. c. 62, \u00a7 8. The gain was measured as the difference between the trusts\u2019 bases in the property and the fair market value. The commissioner took the position that the trusts\u2019 bases were not affected by \u00a7 1014 because the trusts and their shareholders were separate taxable entities. He argues that the trusts should be treated like a corporation. Property owned by a corporation does not \u201cpass\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>from the decedent within the meaning of \u00a7 1014(b), and thus there is no step-up in basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-5\">The trustee contends that the trusts\u2019 bases in one-half of the property should be stepped-up to reflect the fair market value of the deceased shareholder\u2019s one-half interest in the trusts. The trustee argues that the decedent owned an interest in the property itself, similar to an interest in an ordinary trust under \u00a7 1014(b) which is deemed to pass from the decedent. Thus, when the shares passed from the decedent, so did the trust property, and \u00a7 1014(a) should apply.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-6\">The corporate trust, also known as the \u201cMassachusetts business trust,\u201d is an adaptation of the common law trust for the purpose of carrying on a business enterprise originally used to avoid the restrictions against corporate ownership of real property. Annot, 88 A.L.R.3d 704, 711 (1978). The corporate trust is essentially a business organization cast in the trust form. <em>Id. </em>For the most part, it is treated as a partnership or a corporation for Federal tax purposes. \u201cThe fact that any organization is technically cast in the trust form . . . will not change the real character of the organization if, the organization more nearly resembles an association or a partnership than a trust.\u201d 9 J. Mertens, Federal Income Taxation, \u00a7 36.35 (1996). See 26 C.F.R. \u00a7 301.7701-4(b) (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b198-7\">For Massachusetts tax purposes, a corporate trust is a hybrid between an individual and corporate taxpayer.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The corpo- ration trust is taxed as a \u201cresident natural person.\u201d G. L. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>c. 62, \u00a7 8 (a). This means that corporate trusts are treated as individuals for purposes of income and capital gains recognition. However, corporate trusts are treated as corporations for purposes of incorporation and reorganization under I.R.C. \u00a7\u00a7 351-368. G. L. c. 62, \u00a7 8 <em>(a). </em>Essentially, the corporate trust is taxed as an \u201cindividual\u201d entity which closely resembles a corporation. See <em>Commissioner of Revenue </em>v. <em>Northeast Petroleum Corp., </em>401 Mass. 44, 47 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b199-5\">Under Massachusetts tax laws corporate trusts with transferable shares have no relation and little resemblance to ordinary trusts. Ordinary trusts are essentially taxed on the principle of identity between the trust and the beneficiary. For example, one must look through the trust to the domiciliary status of the individual beneficiaries in order to determine the part of the trust\u2019s income which is taxable. If the individual is taxable under G. L. c. 62, his allocable share of the trust\u2019s income is taxable. See G. L. c. 62, \u00a7 10 <em>{a). </em>On the other hand, if the individual is nontaxable by reason of nonresidence, his allocable share of the trust\u2019s income is nontaxable. See G. L. c. 62, \u00a7 10 <em>(a). </em>Furthermore, certain exemptions applicable to the beneficiary may be claimed by the trust to reduce the tax attributable to the individual\u2019s share of the trust\u2019s income. See G. L. c. 62, \u00a7 12. The trust is viewed as an income collecting and distributing agent for the beneficiary. The barrier interposed between the corporate trust and its shareholder by the Legislature stands in strong contrast to the transparent quality of the ordinary trust where the income and gains recognition depends on the status of the beneficiary. See Barrett &amp; deValpine, Taxation of Business Trusts and Other Unincorporated Massachusetts Entities With Transferable Shares, 40 B.U. L. Rev. 329, 340-341 (1960).</p>\n<p id=\"b199-6\">In most significant respects a corporate trust is conceptually treated as a corporation under the Massachusetts tax statutes. \u201c[T]here is no intrinsic difference between a corporate business trust and a corporation.\u201d <em>Commissioner of Revenue </em>v. <em>Northeast Petroleum Corp., supra </em>at 47. The corporate trust is taxed as a distinct entity, rather than as a pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>jection of the individual tax personality of its shareholders. On the corporate trust level, nothing turns on the tax status of the shareholders. Moreover, the corporate trust must recognize capital gains when the trust property is liquidated at a profit.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The Legislature expressed a clear intent to treat corporate trusts and their shareholders as separate entities. <em>B.W. Co. </em>v. <em>State Tax Comm\u2019n, </em>370 Mass. 18, 21 n.4 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b200-5\">The status of the corporate trust shareholder resembles that of a counterpart in a corporation. See <em>Commissioner of Revenue </em>v. <em>Northeast Petroleum Corp., supra </em>at 47; <em>Goodhue </em>v. <em>State St. Trust Co., </em>267 Mass. 28, 34 (1929). \u201cA shareholder in a [corporate] trust only has an equitable interest in trust property; he has neither the legal title nor the right to convey such property; he may not demand a partition of trust property.\u201d 2 Z. Cavitch, Business Organizations \u00a7 43.23, at 43-102 (1997). But see <em>State Tax Comm\u2019n </em>v. <em>Colbert, </em>344 Mass. 494, 497 (1962) (shareholder taxpayer had beneficial interest in trust\u2019s real property). While there is an identity between the trustee and the shareholder in this case, this identity is not required. Depending on the terms of the trust agreement, the shareholder is free to sell his shares. The transferor shareholder recognizes a capital gain or loss on the sale and the transferee shareholder takes shares with a basis equal to the purchase price. See G. L. c. 62, \u00a7 6F. The corporate trust\u2019s basis in its property is unaffected. Similarly, where the trust\u2019s basis in its property is adjusted for depreciation or additions, there is no corresponding adjustment in the shareholder\u2019s basis in his or her shares. The shareholder\u2019s basis in his or her shares and the corporate trust\u2019s basis in its property are not interrelated.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-6\">Because of the similarities in business form, corporate trusts should be treated the same as corporations for the purpose of \u00a7 1014. \u201cIf the State income tax law has incorporated Federal income tax provisions, those provisions should be interpreted as they are interpreted for Federal income tax purposes.\u201d <em>B.W. Co. </em>v. <em>State Tax Comm\u2019n, supra </em>at 22. Corporate property does not fall within the purview of \u00a7 1014(b) when shares are passed from a decedent. See 26 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 1.1014-1, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>1.1014-2. Thus, we conclude that property owned by a corporate trust falls outside the scope of \u00a7 1014 and is not entitled to a step-up in basis when shares pass from a decedent shareholder. The trusts must recognize a gain on the sale of the trust property without the advantage of \u00a7 1014.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> We cannot overlook the tax structure imposed by the Legislature. The shareholders organized themselves as corporate trusts and must abide by the consequences of that election.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-5\">The decision of the Appellate Tax Board is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b195-8\">General Laws c. 62, \u00a7 1 <em>(j), </em>defines \u201c[cjorporate trust\u201d as \u201cany partnership, association or trust, the beneficial interest of which is represented by transferable shares.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b195-10\">This stipulation is problematic. For State tax purposes, the trusts should have been treated as corporate trusts. If they were treated as corporations, I.R.C. \u00a7 337 would apply. See notes 4 &amp; 11, <em>infra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b195-11\">For Federal income tax purposes, the gain or loss realized by a corporation on the sale of its property within one year of the adoption of a complete plan of liquidation is not recognized at the corporate level. I.R.C. \u00a7 337 (a). The gain or loss is only recognized at the shareholder level. The gain or loss is measured as the difference between the shareholder\u2019s basis in the transferable shares and the fair market value of the property distributed.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-12\">Here, the trusts adopted complete plans of liquidation and distributed the property to the remaining shareholder, who measured the gain as the difference between her basis in the shares and the fair market value of the property distributed. This is where I.R.C. \u00a7 1014 benefits the remaining shareholder because the value of the shares she acquired from the decedent were stepped-up to the value at the date of his death.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-13\">For Massachusetts tax purposes the advantage of the step-up in shares is not helpful because the nonrecognition provision of \u00a7 337 is not available to corporate trusts under State law. G. L. c. 62, \u00a7 8 <em>(a). </em>See <em>Commissioner </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number><em>of Revenue </em>v. <em>Shafner, </em>392 Mass. 256, 258 (1984).

The parties do not argue the significance of this fact.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b198-8\">The shareholder also contends that the trusts should be treated like a \u201ccontrolled\u201d corporation under I.R.C. \u00a7 2036. We disagree. Section 2036 only applies to corporations, and G. L. c. 62, \u00a7 8, precludes corporate trusts from using a code provision limited to corporations. <em>Commissioner of Revenue </em>v. <em>Shafner, </em>392 Mass. 256, 258 (1984).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b198-9\">Corporate trusts are not recognized under the I.R.C. For Federal tax purposes, corporate trusts are examined under the \u201ccontrol test\u201d to determine whether they should be taxed as a trust, partnership, or corporation. See <em>Morrissey </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Internal Revenue, </em>296 U.S. 344 (1935). We need not apply this test for State tax purposes because our Legislature has determined that a corporate trust should be taxed as a \u201cresident natural person.\u201d See G. L. c. 62, \u00a7 8. All corporate trusts meeting the definition of G. L. c. 62, \u00a7 1 (/') (beneficial interest represented by transferable shares), are taxable under G. L. c. 62, \u00a7 8, regardless of their treatment for Federal tax purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-10\">A similar test has been used by this court to determine whether beneficiaries are personally liable. Compare <em>First Nat'l Bank </em>v. <em>Chartier, </em>305 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>Mass. 316, 321 (1940) (shareholder who retains excessive control not entitled to limited liability); and <em>Greco </em>v. <em>Hubbard, </em>252 Mass. 37, 43 (1925) (limited liability for beneficiaries of trust with corporate characteristics). However, this test is not applicable for taxation purposes where the Legislature has defined the status of corporate trusts.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b200-7\">By St. 1973, c. 723, \u00a7 2, G. L. c. 62, \u00a7 8 <em>(a), </em>was amended to achieve this result. Prior to 1973, gain on the sale of property in a complete plan of liquidation was not included in a corporate trust\u2019s gross income. See <em>B.W. Co. </em>v. <em>State Tax Comm\u2019n, </em>370 Mass. 18, 21 n.4 (1976).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b201-7\">This holding should not have far reaching consequences. The prudent tax maneuver is to convert the corporate trust into a corporation. Ordinarily, a corporate trust can be converted into a business corporation by means of a merger or other restructuring in a reorganization qualifying as a mere change in form under I.R.C. \u00a7 368(a)(1)(F). If the trusts had taken this step, then \u00a7 337 would have been available. See note 3, <em>supra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
