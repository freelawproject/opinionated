The plaintiff brought an action against the defendants, Electro-Term, Inc., and its president, Warren Smith, after she was punished for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>refusing to attend a company-mandated seminar. The defendants were granted directed verdicts and Kolodziej appealed. This court affirmed the judgment for the defendants, <em>Kolodziej </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>412 Mass. 215 (1992) <em>(Kolodziej I), </em>but, in light of a then recent decision by the United States Supreme Court, <em>Yellow Freight Sys., Inc. </em>v. <em>Donnelly, </em>494 U.S. 820, 825 (1990), holding that State courts may adjudicate claims brought under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2000e et seq. (1988) (Title VII), we remanded the case to give Kolodziej an opportunity to amend her complaint to include that Federal claim. <em>Kolodziej I, supra </em>at 222-223.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-5\">Kolodziej\u2019s amended complaint, which was based on the same underlying facts as her initial complaint, alleged religious discrimination in violation of Title VII. The case was tried to a jury in the Superior Court. Ten written questions, agreed on by the parties, were submitted to the jury. The first four questions and the jury\u2019s answers were as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b539-6\">\u201c1. Did the Defendants require Plaintiff to attend a \u2018devotional service\u2019? A. Yes X No_.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b539-7\">\u201c2. Did the attendance at the seminar conflict with the Plaintiff\u2019s bona fide personal religious beliefs? A. Yes_ NoX.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b539-10\">\u201cIf the answers to <em>both </em>question no. 1 and question no. 2 are \u2018NO\u2019, please date and sign the form. If the answer to either question no. 1 or question no. 2 is \u2018YES\u2019, please continue.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b539-11\">\u201c3. Did the Plaintiff give notice to the Defendants that attendance at the seminar conflicted with her bona fide personal religious beliefs?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b539-12\">\u201cIf the answer is \u2018NO\u2019, please date and sign this form. If the answer is \u2018YES\u2019, please continue. A. Yes X No_.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b539-13\">\u201c4. Did the Defendants discharge or otherwise discriminate against the Plaintiff because she refused to comply with a requirement that was contrary to her bona fide personal religious beliefs? A. Yes_No X.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b539-14\">\u201cIf the answer is \u2018NO\u2019, please date and sign this form. If the answer is \u2018YES\u2019, please continue.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b540-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>In light of the jury\u2019s answer to question 4, the jury did not answer questions 5 through 10. Judgment for the defendants was entered in the Superior Court. Kolodziej appealed and we granted her application for direct appellate review. We now affirm that judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-5\">In <em>Kolodziej I, supra </em>at 217, we stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b540-6\">\u201cThe jury would have been warranted in finding the following facts. Electro-Term, Inc., manufactures and sells electrical connectors. Begun in 1976 by the defendant Smith, the company considers itself a \u2018Christian company.\u2019 It espouses Christian principles and offers a weekly Bible reading session to employees at which attendance is voluntary. In 1988, when the plaintiff\u2019s legal action was commenced, Electro-Term, Inc., employed approximately forty-one people. The plaintiff, a Roman Catholic, was initially hired as a temporary employee by the company in August, 1987. In October, 1987, she was hired permanently and promoted to the position of controller, a management position. At all times she was an employee at will.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b540-7\">\u201cSmith considered it very beneficial for the company\u2019s employees annually to attend a week-long seminar put on by the Institute in Basic Life Principles entitled \u2018Institute in Basic Youth Conflicts.\u2019 Attendance was mandatory for management level employees. The seminar offered instruction in several areas including the resolution of conflicts in interpersonal relationships, dealing with anger, and responding to authority. The seminar was nondenominational, but it used references to Scriptural texts to reinforce and illustrate its teachings.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b540-8\">At retrial, the jury would have been warranted in finding the same facts. In addition, at the retrial, the plaintiff, by her own testimony, presented the following evidence:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b540-9\"><em>Q.: </em>\u201cMrs. Kolodziej, when you went to the seminar on July 13 and 14, how did the seminar open?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b540-10\">A.: \u201cStarted with a prayer.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b540-11\"><em>Q.\\ </em>\u201cHow did it close?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b540-12\">A.: \u201cEnded with a prayer.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b541-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number><em>Q.: </em>\u201cWere there any hymns sung during the course of the seminar?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b541-5\"><em>A.: </em>\u201cYes, there were.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b541-6\"><em>Q.: </em>\u201cDo you remember any of them?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b541-7\">A.: \u201cNo, they\u2019re not familiar to me.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b541-8\"><em>Q.: </em>\u201cWere they familiar at the time?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b541-9\">A.: \u201cNothing I ever heard before.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b541-10\">As the trial judge observed in his memorandum of decision regarding the plaintiff\u2019s motion to amend the judgment or in the alternative grant a new trial, the evidence was \u201cvery scanty\u201d on the issue whether the seminar constituted a devotional service and was \u201cbasically limited to statements that there was an opening prayer and possibly a closing prayer and hymns. There [was] no evidence as to the extent, duration, or content of the prayer.\u201d The judge concluded that Kolodziej had \u201cfailed... to show that any change in the evidence from the first trial [was] sufficient to make this seminar a devotional service.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b541-11\">The plaintiff testified at the second trial that certain aspects of the seminar\u2019s second day of teaching offended her. Specifically, she objected to a portion of the seminar that day which employed an illustrated diagram portraying God\u2019s \u201cplan\u201d for the family. In the diagram, God was depicted at the top with man below God and woman below man. Scriptural texts were referenced in support of this \u201cplan.\u201d The following day, Kolodziej informed Smith that she did not wish to continue to attend the seminar. Kolodziej testified, as did the defendant Smith, that at first Kolodziej told Smith that she could not understand how the seminar related to her work, and that she was needed at home to take care of her granddaughter and her ailing mother. Kolodziej also testified to having told Smith that the seminar\u2019s contents were contrary to her religious belief. Smith informed Kolodziej that if she did not attend the seminar she could not be a manager in his company but could retain employment in a nonmanagerial position. Kolodziej refused further to attend the seminar, was immediately relieved of her management responsibilities and consequently walked off the job.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-12\">Since the appeal before us concerns only a claim of religious <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>discrimination under Title VII, our analysis is governed by Federal law. Title VII forbids an employer \u201cto . . . discharge an individual, or otherwise to discriminate against any individual with respect to his compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment, because of such individual\u2019s . . . religion.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-2(a)(l). In order to establish a prima facie case of workplace religious discrimination under Title VII, a plaintiff must prove that (1) a bona fide religious belief of the employee conflicted with an employment policy; (2) the employee informed the employer of the conflict; and (3) the employee was penalized in some way because of the conflict. <em>Ansonia Bd. of Educ. </em>v. <em>Philbrook, </em>479 U.S. 60, 65-66 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b542-5\">The judge instructed the jury as follows: \u201cNow, religious beliefs include moral or ethical beliefs as to what is right or wrong which are sincerely held with the strength of religious views.\u201d The instruction comports with relevant law. See <em>Welsh </em>v. <em>United States, </em>398 U.S. 333 (1970); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Seeger, </em>380 U.S. 163 (1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b542-6\">In response to the second and fourth written questions put to them, the jury found that attendance at the seminar did not conflict with the plaintiff\u2019s bona fide personal religious beliefs and that the defendants did not discharge or otherwise discriminate against the plaintiff because she refused to comply with a requirement that was contrary to her bona fide personal religious beliefs. Thus, regardless of whether the jury were warranted in finding that the defendants required Kolodziej to attend a \u201cdevotional service,\u201d a matter we need not decide, Kolodziej has failed to prove her case. See <em>Ansonia Bd. of Educ. </em>v. <em>Philbrook, supra </em>at 65-66.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-7\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
