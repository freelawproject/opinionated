See G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 24.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> A former employee of the plaintiff, HDH Corporation (HDH), brought an action against HDH in the Superior Court, seeking damages for emotional distress, lost wages, and lost benefits caused by gender discrimination and wrongful termination. The employee\u2019s husband claimed loss of consortium and loss of support in the same action.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-6\">HDH notified its workers\u2019 compensation and employers\u2019 liability insurer, the defendant, Atlantic Charter Insurance Company (Atlantic), and requested that Atlantic defend the civil action. Atlantic refused to defend and denied coverage.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> HDH assumed the defense of the action and eventually agreed to submit to binding arbitration. The arbitrator found that the former employee was wrongfully terminated and awarded $120,000 to her and $25,000 to her husband. HDH paid the award and brought this action against Atlantic, seeking to recover the amounts paid on the award, its legal fees, and G. L. c. 93A damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-7\">Atlantic moved for summary judgment, claiming that there was no coverage for liability arising from the employee\u2019s civil action under either Part One, the workers\u2019 compensation portion of the insurance policy, or Part Two, the employers\u2019 liability portion. Atlantic argued that Part One only covered claims for benefits payable under the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, G. L. c. 152, and not civil actions for common law damages. Atlantic further claimed that, because the employee had not given statutory notice <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>of her intent to claim her right of action at common law, HDH had acted at its own peril by choosing to defend the civil suit on its merits rather than asserting the absolute defense of exclusivity of the workers\u2019 compensation statute. See note 1, <em>supra. </em>Atlantic argued that, by failing to assert the exclusivity defense and to file a notice of claim for workers\u2019 compensation benefits with the Department of Industrial Accidents (department), see G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 6, HDH had waived any right to coverage under Part One of the insurance policy. Regarding Part Two, the employers\u2019 liability portion, the insurance policy expressly excluded coverage of \u201cdamages arising out of the discharge of, coercion of, or discrimination against any employee in violation of law.\u201d A Superior Court judge allowed Atlantic\u2019s motion for summary judgment. The judge ruled that HDH was not entitled to recover from Atlantic because HDH should have invoked the absolute defense of exclusivity to bar the former employee\u2019s civil action.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> HDH appealed to the Appeals Court, which correctly concluded that there was no coverage under Part Two, the employers\u2019 liability portion, because of the policy\u2019s express exclusion of damages arising out of the discharge or discrimination of an employee. <em>HDH Corp. </em>v. <em>Atlantic Charter Ins. Co., </em>41 Mass App. Ct. 131 (1996). See, e.g., <em>Lusalon, Inc. </em>v. <em>Hartford Accident &amp; Indem. Co., </em>400 Mass. 767, 773 (1987) (no duty to defend where coverage precluded by specific policy exclusion).</p>\n<p id=\"b455-5\">However, the Appeals Court determined that the insurer may have had a duty to defend HDH in the civil action because the allegations of the employee\u2019s complaint, reasonably read, stated a claim covered under the terms of Part One, the workers\u2019 compensation portion of the policy.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The court rejected Atlantic\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>argument that Part One of the policy provided a duty to defend only against claims for benefits brought before the department. The court reasoned that, because G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 25, in certain circumstances, requires workers\u2019 compensation insurers to reimburse employers for damages awarded to employees \u201cby a judgment of a court,\u201d Atlantic\u2019s duty to defend under Part One of the policy was not limited to claims for workers\u2019 compensation benefits.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Accordingly, the Appeals Court reversed and remanded for further proceedings against Atlantic. We granted Atlantic\u2019s application for further appellate review. We affirm the granting of summary judgment in favor of Atlantic.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b456-5\">The well-settled rule is that an insurer has a duty to defend if the allegations of the complaint are reasonably susceptible of an interpretation that they state a claim covered by the terms of the insurance policy. <em>Liberty Mut. Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>SCA Servs., Inc., </em>412 Mass. 330, 331-332 (1992), and cases cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-6\">The terms of Part One of the policy clearly limit defense and indemnity of the employer to claims for benefits required by the workers\u2019 compensation statute.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> However, the employee brought <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>a civil action seeking monetary damages, and made no claim for workers\u2019 compensation benefits. Indeed, no matter what the allegations of the complaint, as a matter of law, workers\u2019 compensation benefits cannot be recovered by instituting a civil action.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> A claim for benefits must be brought before the department and adjudicated through the statutorily prescribed workers\u2019 compensation system. See <em>Neff v. Commissioner of the Dep\u2019t of Indus. Accs., </em>421 Mass. 70, 74 (1995) (describing procedural course for the adjudication of workers\u2019 compensation dispute through the Department of Industrial Accidents). See also <em>Alecks\u2019s Case, </em>301 Mass. 403, 404 (1938) (under the workers\u2019 compensation statute, an employee \u201cacquires a right to compensation for personal injury as provided in that act, to be enforced by claim against the insurer filed with the Industrial Accident Board .... [T]he policy of the act is to deprive [the employee] of all right of action in tort against his employer for damages for an injury within the scope of the [workers\u2019] compensation act\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b457-5\">The record demonstrates that a claim for benefits was never initiated by the employee, as mandated by G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 10. Accordingly, Atlantic is correct that it had no duty to defend the civil action because the complaint did not state a claim that could result in liability which Atlantic would be obligated to pay under any reasonable interpretation of Part One of the policy. See, e.g., <em>Jimmy\u2019s Diner, Inc. </em>v. <em>Liquor Liab. Joint Underwriting Ass\u2019n of Mass., </em>410 Mass. 61, 65 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b457-6\">The distinction is not merely a procedural matter of bringing an action in the wrong forum. As amici point out, there are fundamental differences between a claim for workers\u2019 compen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>sation benefits and a lawsuit seeking civil damages. The Legislature intended that the workers\u2019 compensation system supplant the common law tort system as a means for compensating injured employees. See <em>Alecks\u2019s Case, </em>301 Mass. 403, 404 (1938). Accordingly, the purposes, remedies available, evidentiary burdens, and standards of proof employed in adjudicating within the two distinct systems are different by legislative design. See <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>209 Mass. 607, 609 (1911) (proposed Workers\u2019 Compensation Act represented \u201ca radical departure in the manner of dealing with actions or claims for damages for personal injuries received by employees in the course of their employment from that which has heretofore prevailed in this Commonwealth\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b458-5\">Our conclusion also is bolstered by courts in other jurisdictions which have, in similar circumstances, interpreted virtually identical language in workers\u2019 compensation and employers\u2019 liability insurance policies as providing no duty to defend in civil litigation. See <em>La Jolla Beach &amp; Tennis Club, Inc. </em>v. <em>Industrial Indem. Co., 9 </em>Cal. 4th 27, 46 (1994)<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> (\u201cthe civil and workers\u2019 compensation systems are distinct, and therefore a workers\u2019 compensation insurer which promises to pay claims for benefits does not have a duty to defend civil actions seeking damages\u201d); <em>Bond Bldrs., Inc. </em>v. <em>Commercial Union Ins. Co., </em>670 A.2d 1388, 1390 (Me. 1996) (insurance policy \u201c[o]n its face\u201d imposes no duty to defend against an employee\u2019s tort claim action which is barred by the exclusivity and immunity provisions of the workers\u2019 compensation act); <em>Homes Contr., Inc. </em>v. <em>Georgia Ins. Co., </em>211 Ga. App. 852, 854 (1994) (insurance policy provides coverage only for claims for benefits due under the workers\u2019 compensation act and imposes no duty to defend against a civil suit for damages).</p>\n<p id=\"b458-6\">The Appeals Court also relied on G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 25, as buttressing its conclusion that Atlantic may have had a duty to defend the civil action. 41 Mass. App. Ct. 131, 134 (1996). See note 5, <em>supra. </em>However, when properly read in its statutory context and in accordance with the legislative intent of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>workers\u2019 compensation statute, \u00a7 25 places no such duty on Atlantic in these circumstances. See <em>Neff, supra </em>at 73, quoting <em>Vining Disposal Serv., Inc. </em>v. <em>Selectmen of Westford, </em>416 Mass. 35, 38 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b459-5\">The language of G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 25, directing an insurer to reimburse an employer that has been \u201crequired by a judgment of a court to pay to an employee any damages on account of personal injury,\u201d must be read consistently with the immediately preceding exclusive remedy provision, \u00a7 24, to require payments solely for judgments arising from a civil action for personal injuries brought by an employee who has affirmatively rejected the workers\u2019 compensation system.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The statute requires that all other claims for workers\u2019 compensation benefits be adjudicated through the department, not the courts. The only court proceedings envisioned by the statute in which damages would be awarded for personal injuries is that action brought by the rare employee who rejects the workers\u2019 compensation system at the time of hire. That circumstance is not presented here.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b459-6\">Any other reading of G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 25, would render the waiver provisions of G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 24, meaningless and would subvert the legislative intent of the statute. Cf. <em>Price </em>v. <em>Railway Express Agency, Inc., </em>322 Mass. 476, 480 (1948) (construing the phrase \u201cevery employer\u201d in a provision of the workers\u2019 compensation statute so as not to subvert the intent of other sections expressly excepting certain employers from the ambit of the act). General Laws c. 152, \u00a7 25, does not create an independent civil remedy for injured employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-7\">Public policy also supports our decision. The fundamental purpose of the workers\u2019 compensation system is to make funds more readily available to injured employees. Accordingly, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>Commonwealth requires all employers to provide workers\u2019 compensation benefits to their employees. See G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 25A. As amici point out, the cost of mandatory workers\u2019 compensation insurance is a significant aspect of the business climate of the Commonwealth. Recent legislative reforms have sought to lower the insurance rates employers must pay to provide the security of workers\u2019 compensation benefits to their employees. See St. 1991, c. 398. Requiring workers\u2019 compensation insurers to defend civil actions outside the workers\u2019 compensation system would represent an unwarranted expansion of coverage historically understood as provided under this mandatory form of insurance,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> a result which would increase insurance costs for employers, and could gut the legislative scheme for workers\u2019 compensation. See, e.g., <em>La Jolla Beach &amp; Tennis Club, Inc., supra </em>at 44.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-5\">The decision of the Superior Court allowing summary judgment for Atlantic is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-6\">\n<em>Judgment of the Superior Court affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b454-8\">General Laws c. 152, \u00a7 24, provides: \u201cAn employee shall be held to have waived his right of action at common law ... in respect to an injury that is compensable under this chapter, to recover damages for personal injuries, if he shall not have given his employer, at the time of his contract of hire, written notice that he claimed such right ....

See <em>HDH Corp. </em>v. <em>Atlantic Charter Ins. Co., </em>41 Mass. App. Ct. 131, 133-134 (1996), quoting <em>College-Town, Div. of Interco, Inc. </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Comm\u2019n Against Discrimination, </em>400 Mass. 156, 169 (1987) (\u201cwe do not agree that damages in this case resulting from the violation of G. L. c. 151B, \u00a7 4, are compensable exclusively under the Workmen\u2019s [szc] Compensation Act\u201d). The Appeals Court concluded that Atlantic\u2019s duty to defend arose out of the employee\u2019s claim for emotional injury resulting from her wrongful termination. See <em>id. </em>at 134, citing <em>Simmons </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number><em>Merchants Mut. Ins.

On the view we take, we need not discuss the nature of the employee\u2019s claims nor address the extent to which the underlying civil action might be barred by the invocation of G.
