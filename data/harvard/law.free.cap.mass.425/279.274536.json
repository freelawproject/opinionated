Represented by new counsel on appeal, both defendants argue that the judge should have allowed their respective motions for a required finding of not guilty. We conclude that the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence was sufficient to warrant the defendants\u2019 convictions of murder in the first degree. We reject the defendants\u2019 other arguments that are directed at obtaining a new trial. We also find no basis to grant either defendant any relief under G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E. Accordingly, we affirm the defendants\u2019 convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-9\">The evidence, considered in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, would have permitted the jury to find the following facts. On Saturday, June 26, 1993, the victim, Belinda Miscioscia, was socializing at her brother\u2019s home in Chelsea with her brother, her brother\u2019s girl friend, and a friend with whom she had made plans for the evening. After drinking a few beers, the four decided to \u201cpitch in\u201d on a bag of marihuana, and the victim \u201cpaged\u201d Cowels, from whom she previously had made similar purchases. After an initial effort to connect with Cowels at a neighborhood store failed, the victim again paged him and made arrangements to meet him at a party down the street from her brother\u2019s house. Although she said she was afraid to meet with Cowels by herself, the victim left her brother\u2019s home between 8:45 and 8:55 p.m. and walked, alone, down the street to the party. When she failed to return home after about one and one-half hours, the others became anxious and attempted to contact Cowels by paging him several times. Eventually, the victim\u2019s friend left, assuming that he had been stood up, and the others went to bed.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-10\">At the party, the victim met Cowels and Mims, with whom she was also familiar. Both defendants had had previous sexual encounters with the victim. The three left the party and went together to an apartment where a friend of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>defendants, Robert Salie, lived. The four shared a marihuana cigarette. Both defendants and the victim went into Salie\u2019s bedroom and engaged in sexual intercourse, offering Salie a chance to join in, which he declined. The victim and the defendants subsequently left Salie\u2019s apartment and drove away in Cowels\u2019s automobile.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-5\">At around 11 p.m., the group arrived at Cowels\u2019s sister\u2019s condominium unit. When Cowels\u2019s sister returned home from work around 11:20 p.m., she was angered to find the victim there with her brother and insisted that they all leave. The three left in Cowels\u2019s automobile.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-6\">At about 11:30 p.m., Salie\u2019s doorbell rang, and he opened his door. The defendants rushed inside and went directly to the bathroom, where they remained for approximately twenty minutes. When they emerged from the bathroom, the defendants were carrying their clothes in plastic bags. Mims sat on the couch. Cowels showed Salie one of his sneakers, spotted with blood, and told Salie, \u201cThis is what happens when you fuck with me,\u201d and Cowels proceeded to warn Salie that if he \u201csaid anything [he would] get hurt.\u201d Cowels then told Salie that \u201cyou will read about it in the papers tomorrow.\u201d Cowels explained his statement by telling Salie that newspaper articles would disclose \u201chow we killed her.\u201d After this last statement, Cowels winked at Mims. Both Cowels and Mims then told Salie that the victim \u201cwas a fucking pig and got what she deserved.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b301-7\">Cowels again threatened Salie by pointing a finger at Salie\u2019s head, simulating a gun, and told Salie that if he said anything, he would get \u201cfucking hurt.\u201d Mims also told Salie to keep his mouth shut. Salie gave the defendants clean clothes, including a pair of green and grey hiking boots, which he gave to Mims.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-8\">The defendants left Salie\u2019s apartment but returned a third time about 1 a.m.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The defendants repeated their threats to Salie and warned him again to \u201ckeep his mouth shut.\u201d Cowels predicted that \u201che was going to jail.\u201d Mims asked if he could spend the night, and Salie agreed. Cowels then left the apartment, and Mims spent the night on Salie\u2019s couch.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-9\">The next morning, Salie and the defendants went to play softball. At the softball game, Mims wore the shoes loaned to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>him by Salie. A Mend of Mims noticed that he was not wearing his expensive Reebok sneakers, and when questioned, Mims explained that he had thrown them out because they had gotten \u201call wet and squeaky\u201d in the rain the previous night. (Testimony indicated that it had not rained on Saturday night.)</p>\n<p id=\"b302-5\">Meanwhile, the victim\u2019s family was dismayed to discover that she had not returned home Saturday night. The victim\u2019s niece was scheduled to be christened Sunday morning, and her family thought it odd that the victim would miss the event. They proceeded to page Cowels, who did not respond, and drove around the neighborhood looking for the victim. When Cowels finally returned their page, he denied any knowledge of the victim\u2019s whereabouts and said he had dropped the victim off at a neighborhood store at 11:30 p.m. on Saturday night. Cowels was hostile and said he did not care where the victim was. That night, the victim\u2019s family filed a missing person\u2019s report at the Chelsea police station.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-6\">The next morning, the victim\u2019s body was found lying face down in a pool of blood, on top of a small platform, only a few miles from Salie\u2019s apartment, in a location described as a \u201clover\u2019s lane type area.\u201d She had suffered six different stab wounds, three to her body and three to her neck, as well as slash wounds to her neck and wounds to her right hand that were characterized as \u201cdefensive.\u201d Her face was so badly beaten that her family had difficulty identifying her. A bag of marihuana was found stuffed inside her bra. An autopsy determined that the victim had been killed late on Saturday night or early on Sunday morning, and that she had died from multiple stab wounds produced by one or possibly two knives. One of the stab wounds had penetrated the victim\u2019s heart.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-7\">Trooper Randy Cipoletta of the State police obtained Cowels\u2019s pager number from the victim\u2019s family and arranged a meeting. When Cowels came to meet with the police, he was wearing what appeared to be a brand new pair of sneakers. Cowels was told only that the police were investigating a missing person report. Cowels stated that he had been with the victim on Saturday night but that he, Mims, and two others had been playing pool at a bar named Triple O\u2019s and had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>later dropped the victim off near her home.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Cowels acknowledged that his pager had gone off several times during the evening, but explained that he had told the victim her family was trying to reach her and that the victim had failed to return their calls. Cowels referred to the victim as a \u201cpig\u201d during his interview with police. After Trooper Cipoletta stated that he wanted to speak with Mims, Cowels offered to go pick up Mims and bring him back to the police station. Mims\u2019s statement to the police mirrored that of Cowels, including references to the victim as a \u201cdirty pig.\u201d While Mims was being interviewed, Cowels waited outside the interview room, where he was approached by State police Sergeant Michael J. Crisp, who asked to speak with him. Cowels repeated his original story to Sergeant Crisp, but was startled when Crisp relayed the fact that police had already discovered the victim\u2019s body. Cowels suddenly burst into tears and cried, \u201cI\u2019m only twenty-three years old. I don\u2019t want to go to jail.\u201d Cowels quickly composed himself and asked whether he was free to go, to which Sergeant Crisp assented. Cowels and Mims were allowed to leave the police station.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-5\">Other evidence surfaced during the police investigation. A friend of Cowels observed a pair of sneakers in the trunk of Cowels\u2019s car and asked him if they were the \u201cnotorious sneakers that everyone was talking about.\u201d Cowels acknowledged that they were the sneakers and then, while his friend was watching, threw them into some nearby bushes. Cowels\u2019s friend later led police to the sneakers, which tested positive for the presence of blood on the sole of the left shoe, even though they were not found until nearly one month after the crime. A search of the bathroom in Salie\u2019s apartment turned up two towels that tested positive for the presence of human <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>blood.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Occult blood was also found on the inside door release on the driver\u2019s side of Cowels\u2019s car, as well as on the gear shift knob, which had fallen off the stick shift and was found on the floor of Cowels\u2019s car, between the passenger\u2019s seat and the door.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-5\">Some evidence that could have assisted the murder investigation disappeared. A shirt belonging to Cowels, which purportedly had a \u201crust colored\u201d stain on its front, could not be found. Salie\u2019s grey and green boots, which had been seen by police in Mims\u2019s closet after the murder, also disappeared.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In addition, some evidence was found that did not connect the two men to the murder. Salie gave police a black T-shirt, which he said Mims had worn on the night of the murder. The T-shirt tested negative for the presence of blood, as did the couch on which Mims spent the night. Napkins found at the scene of the murder tested positive for a blood type which was not that of either the defendants or the victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-6\">There was also evidence that the defendants went to considerable lengths to block the police investigation into the murder. There was the evidence, previously recounted, that both defendants disposed of clothing and other items that were important to the investigation and threatened Salie to keep him from revealing their activities on the night of the murder, and the additional evidence showing that both defendants had lied in the statements they gave to the police. Mims was present when a friend of his was subpoenaed, and after reading the subpoena, Mims exclaimed, \u201cFuck them. You don\u2019t have to say nothing to them fucks.\u201d Salie indicated that he received a threatening note on his door (from an unidentified sender) that warned him, \u201cYou talk, you die.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b304-7\">For their part, the defendants contended that they did not commit tire crime. They attacked the Commonwealth\u2019s case by attempting to show that Salie should not be believed; by suggesting that other men may have committed the murder; by criticizing the thoroughness of the police investigation; by introducing statements to the police that placed them <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>elsewhere at the time of the murder; and by introducing testimony that tended to support their alibi statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-5\">1. Both defendants moved for required findings of not guilty at the close of the Commonwealth\u2019s case and at the close of all the evidence. The motions were denied. The jury were given instructions that permitted them to find each defendant guilty of the victim\u2019s murder either as a principal or as a participant in a joint venture. We conclude that the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence was sufficient to allow the jury to convict each defendant on both theories.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-6\">\u201c[T]he fact that the defendants were] the last person[s] seen with the victim, at a time and place in close proximity to where the victim was shortly thereafter found in a battered condition, is probative evidence of the defendants\u2019] guilt.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Montecalvo, </em>367 Mass. 46, 55 (1975). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Stewart, </em>411 Mass. 345, 350-351 (1991). Further, the evidence supported a conclusion by the jury that both defendants were present with the victim when she was murdered. The victim\u2019s body was found in a location described as a \u201clover\u2019s lane type area\u201d with a bag of marihuana stuffed inside her bra. In view of what had transpired between the victim and the defendants on the night of the murder, and their base opinion of her as promiscuous, the jury could find that she had been murdered after a disagreement with the defendants over sex, drugs, or both. Cowels made several damaging statements that directly implicated him in the murder. These included a statement when he showed Salie a blood-stained sneaker that, \u201cThis is what happens when you fuck with me,\u201d an admission that \u201cwe killed her,\u201d a statement that \u201che was going to jail,\u201d and a statement that \u201cI\u2019m only twenty-three years old. I don\u2019t want to go to jail.\u201d Mims stated that the victim \u201cwas a fucking pig and got what she deserved.\u201d The jury could find that Mims was present in Salie\u2019s apartment and did not object after hearing Cowels tell Salie that the newspapers the following day would have an article describing \u201chow <em>we </em>killed her\u201d (emphasis added). The medical testimony indicated that the victim was stabbed by one or possibly two knives. The jury also could have found that both defendants had engaged in a considerable common effort to conceal the crime, including disposing of their clothing and other items that could link them to the murder, threatening and intimidating witnesses, giving the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>police false statements, and arranging testimony to support those false statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-5\">Cowels states in his brief on appeal that a required finding of not guilty should have been entered because \u201c[a]s argued by [his] defense counsel [at trial], the scientific evidence did not sufficiently establish the defendant\u2019s guilt.\u201d There is no merit to this argument. The summary of the case against Cowels set forth above was sufficient to warrant his conviction of murder by the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-6\">Mims\u2019s trial counsel made no objection to the admission of Cowels\u2019s statement to Salie that \u201cwe killed her,\u201d and no argument is made on appeal that the statement was not properly received in evidence against Mims as an admission. The present argument by Mims\u2019s appellate counsel is essentially that the statement has no probative value because, based on Cowels\u2019s wink at the time it was made, the statement was ambiguous. Mims\u2019s appellate counsel also argues that Mims\u2019s statement to Salie that the victim \u201cgot what she deserved\u201d could not reasonably have been constmed by the jury as any indication of his participation in the murder. We think these arguments go to the weight of the evidence, a matter exclusively reserved for the jury, <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Montecalvo, supra </em>at 56, and that the jury could have properly considered the statements as inculpating Mims in the murder. We conclude that Mims\u2019s argument takes too narrow a view of the Commonwealth\u2019s case and that the prosecution\u2019s evidence, taken as a whole with reasonable inferences that could be drawn from it, including the incriminating conduct of the defendants after the murder, was sufficient to warrant a finding by the jury, under the \u201cany rational trier of fact\u201d standard, that Mims was guilty.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cordle, </em>412 Mass. 172, 175 (1992). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cruz, </em>416 Mass. 27, 29 (1993); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Doucette, </em>408 Mass. 454, 461 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b306-7\">2. Both defendants argue that they are entitled to a new <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>trial because the prosecutor\u2019s closing argument was improper and prejudicial. In his summation, the prosecutor repeatedly referred to the defendants\u2019 characterization of the victim as a \u201cfucking dirty pig.\u201d He also referred, in the language set forth below, to the possibility that the victim had suffered at her death.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The defendants objected to these portions of the prosecutor\u2019s closing argument and argue on appeal that these comments impermissibly played on the prejudices of the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-5\">The prosecutor could properly make some reference in his closing argument to the defendants\u2019 statements that the victim was a \u201cfucking dirty pig\u201d because there was evidence that both defendants had made the statement, and the characterization went to the issues of motive and joint venture. The prosecutor\u2019s argument was, in part, fair rebuttal to the contentions made by the defendants\u2019 trial counsel in their summations that there was no evidence of motive or joint venture. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mello, </em>420 Mass. 375, 380-381 (1995). We agree with the defendants that the prosecutor\u2019s mention of the defendants\u2019 statements at least nine times in his summation went over the line of acceptable commentary and constituted an effort by the prosecutor to stimulate sympathy for the victim. We do not, however, consider the excess a basis for reversal.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-6\">The prosecutor\u2019s \u201cbottle up her screams\u201d argument was based on facts not in evidence and was improper. The judge\u2019s instructions emphasized the jury\u2019s obligation in the following terms: \u201cYou are to perform your duty without bias, prejudice or sympathy as to any party. Both the defendant and the public expect that you will carefully and impartially consider all the evidence in the case, apply the law as stated by me, and above all to reach a just verdict regardless of the consequences.\u201d The judge also pointed out that the arguments of counsel did not constitute evidence. Because of the judge\u2019s instructions and the jury\u2019s focus on the main issues in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>case,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> the prosecutor\u2019s regrettable remarks do not require a new trial.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Viriyahiranpaiboon, </em>412 Mass. 224, 232 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b308-5\">3. The defendants raise several issues with respect to the adequacy of the judge\u2019s instructions to the jury. We next address these issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-6\">(a) During his discussion of the concept of reasonable doubt, the judge made a misstatement by omitting the word \u201cnot\u201d from a portion of the instruction.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Trial counsel for the defendants called the omission to the judge\u2019s attention. The judge did not make a specific correction, but instead reinstructed the jury that the Commonwealth had the burden of proof beyond a reasonable doubt on each and every element of the crimes charged. No further objection was made to the reinstruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-7\">The judge\u2019s omission does not provide a basis for a new trial. The instructions on reasonable doubt, considered as a whole, correctly explained reasonable doubt, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rosa, </em>422 Mass. 18, 27 (1996), and, as a consequence, it is likely that a reasonable juror would have understood that the incorrect sentence contained a slip of the tongue, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Grant, </em>418 Mass. 76, 85 (1994). Importantly, in response to a question by the jury during deliberations for \u201creview . . . [of] the legal definition of reasonable doubt,\u201d the judge correctly reinstructed on the concept. After the reinstruction, a reasonable juror could not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>have misunderstood the concept because of the mistake in the original charge.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b309-5\">(b) In his definition of malice, the judge linked the concept to a \u201cframe of mind which includes not only anger, hatred and revenge, but also every other unlawful [or] unjustifiable motive.\u201d No objection was made, and the jury instructions on malice were otherwise correct in explaining the three prongs of malice described in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Grey, </em>399 Mass. 469, 470 n.l (1987). The case was tried before our decision in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Eagles, </em>419 Mass. 825, 836 (1995), which disapproved of the \u201canger, hatred and revenge\u201d language. We conclude that the reference did not create a substantial likelihood of a miscarriage of justice. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Torres, </em>420 Mass. 479, 486-487 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b309-6\">(c) The defendants requested an instruction that the jury should consider the effect of intoxication in deciding whether they specifically intended to kill the victim and acted with malice or premeditation.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The defendants also requested a somewhat confusing instruction on the issue of mental impairment.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> A charge conference was held by the judge, but no record was kept of the results of the conference. The judge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>instructed the jury that they could consider voluntary intoxication \u201cin determining whether or not the Commonwealth has proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant or the defendants committed or attempted to commit the crime with an intent which exhibited a conscious disregard to human life.\u201d The judge also told the jury that voluntary intoxication had relevance to malice and was \u201cone of the factors you should consider in your deliberations on the issue of whether the defendant[s] had specific intent to kill or grievously injure the victim.\u201d The defendants\u2019 trial counsel made no objection to the instruction and no additional instructions were requested. The defendants now argue that a new trial is required because the judge\u2019s intoxication instruction should have been extended to the so-called \u201cthird prong\u201d of malice<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> which has relevance to murder in the first degree by reason of extreme atrocity or cruelty and murder in the second degree.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-5\">We conclude that the defendants\u2019 argument is to be decided under the substantial likelihood of a miscarriage of justice standard. The instruction given by the judge appears to constitute an effort by him to respond to the defendants\u2019 requested instruction on intoxication. The judge may have considered the requested instruction on mental impairment, see note 13, <em>supra, </em>as unnecessary because there was no evidence that the defendants suffered from any mental impairment (apart from the issue of intoxication), and because the instruction appears by its own terms to have been directed at a finding of voluntary manslaughter, a verdict that had no basis in the evidence, even though the judge instructed on it and gave it to the jury as an option. What the judge said about voluntary intoxication did not disturb the defendants\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>trial counsel, who, as has been mentioned, made no objection and asked for no additional instructions. The principal issue at trial was the identity of the murderer or murderers. No contention was made that the victim had not been murdered; the defendants asserted instead that Salie should not be believed and that they were somewhere else when the victim was murdered. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Moore, </em>408 Mass. 117, 134 (1990), and cases cited. Although there was some evidence that the defendants had been drinking and had shared a marihuana cigarette,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> there was no evidence that they were so intoxicated that they lacked awareness of their actions. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fano, </em>400 Mass. 296, 306-308 (1987), and cases cited. Further, in view of the testimony of the medical examiner that the victim had been stabbed six times, had suffered slash wounds to her neck and \u201cdefensive\u201d wounds to her right hand, and had been severely beaten, the case was not a \u201cthird prong\u201d malice case. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pierce, </em>419 Mass. 28, 37, 39 (1994); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Moore, supra </em>at 135; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gabbidon, </em>398 Mass. 1, 5-6 (1986). The judge\u2019s instruction on intoxication did not create a substantial likelihood of a miscarriage of justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-5\">(d) The defendants\u2019 trial counsel were allowed full latitude to present and argue to the jury their contention that the failure of the investigating authorities to conduct certain tests undermined the prosecution\u2019s case. The decision whether to instruct the jury on die failure to conduct forensic tests lies within the discretion of the trial judge, <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cordle, </em>412 Mass. 172, 177 (1992), and the judge\u2019s refusal to give an instruction did not constitute an abuse of discretion. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rivera, </em>424 Mass. 266, 274 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b311-6\">(e) The judge had discretion in deciding how to respond to the jury\u2019s requests for reinstruction on reasonable doubt and on \u201chow the defendants\u2019 behavior after the fact may be a fac- tor in determining the verdict.\u201d The judge did not abuse that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>discretion by including in his response to the jury further instruction on the principles of joint venture.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-5\">4. The defendants\u2019 remaining contentions need not be discussed at great length.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-6\">(a) Cowels sought to exclude his statements to Salie on the ground that they were the product of intoxication. The judge held a voir dire and ruled that the statements were voluntary and rationally made. Salie\u2019s testimony warranted the judge\u2019s implicit factual finding that, although Cowels may have consumed some alcohol and shared a marihuana cigarette, his mind was rational, and his faculties under control, when he made the statements. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Koney, </em>421 Mass. 295, 305 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b312-7\">(b) There is no merit to Cowels\u2019s claim that the judge erred by denying his motion to sever his trial from Mims\u2019s trial so that Mims could testify and corroborate Cowels\u2019s alibi. This ground did not furnish a basis for requiring severance, and no abuse of discretion occurred when the judge denied the motion.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b312-8\">(c) A Commonwealth witness, Angel Gonzalez, unexpectedly claimed his privilege against self-incrimination before the jury. The judge did not err in denying a mistrial. The prosecution engaged in no misconduct and was taken by surprise by the witness\u2019s' claim. Based on the \u201cspecific requests of all three counsel in the case,\u201d the judge did not instruct the jury on the matter. Gonzalez was a minor Commonwealth witness, and his demurral added no critical weight to the Commonwealth\u2019s case. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Martin, </em>372 Mass. 412, 422 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b312-9\">(d) The four evidentiary rulings, argued only cursorily by the defendants, raise no basis for a new trial. The judge\u2019s solitary comment that a police report should be marked \u201cfor the record on appeal\u201d could have created no harm in view of the judge\u2019s final instructions to the jury. The defense witness,. John Heald, was properly impeached by his conviction for a drug offense on which the sentence was suspended. See G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 21, second par. Salie\u2019s testimony about a threatening note left at his door, and testimony by the witness Cheryl Tatarouns that the victim was afraid to meet \u201cMike\u201d by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>herself, although they may have been erroneously admitted, caused no prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-5\">5. We have reviewed the entire record and found no reason to exercise our extraordinary powers under G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E, to grant either defendant a new trial or to reduce the verdicts returned by the jury to impose a lesser degree of guilt. The conviction of each defendant of murder in the first degree is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b301-10\">When they returned to Salie\u2019s apartment the third time, the defendants were not carrying any bags.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b303-6\">Cowels claimed that Lawrence Bavis, a bartender at Triple O\u2019s, had been playing pool with them. After police requested a meeting with Bavis, Bavis was approached by Cowels and a friend of Cowels. Cowels and his friend told Bavis to \u201cremember\u201d that the four had played pool the night before. In his subsequent interview with police, Bavis denied that he had been playing pool at Triple O\u2019s with Cowels or Mims on the night of the murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-7\">After they left the victim near her home in Chelsea, the defendants said that they went to a bar and that later Cowels dropped Mims off at Salie\u2019s apartment before going to his girl friend\u2019s home to spend the night.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b304-8\">Tests on the towels were inconclusive, although the chemist at the State police laboratory testified that there was a \u201cweak reaction\u201d to blood type A.

When questioned about the boots, Mims claimed that they were his and that he wore them when he played softball.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b306-8\">We reject Mims\u2019s argument that we should abandon the \u201cany rational trier of fact standard\u201d first described in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Latimore, </em>378 Mass. 671, 677 (1979), <em>S.C., </em>423 Mass. 129 (1996), in favor of a standard that assesses the evidence in terms of what a \u201creasonable jury\u201d could find. The <em>Latimore </em>standard fully protects a defendant\u2019s due process rights under the Federal and State Constitutions.

You cannot find malice unless you find beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant had an intent to kill, to do grievous bodily harm, or to do an act creating a plain and strong likelihood that death or grievous harm would follow. You may consider the evidence of the defendant\u2019s mental impairment at the time of the act alleged to have resulted in the death of the deceased in determining whether the defendant had the capacity to form a specific intent to kill the deceased or to do him grievous bodily harm. If, after considering all the evidence, including the evidence of the defendant\u2019s mental impairment, you have a reasonable doubt as to whether the defendant specifically intended to kill the deceased or to do him grievous bodily harm, you may consider whether malice has nonetheless been established on the basis of an intentional act by the defendant act [j\u00edc] alone, however, unless you also find beyond a reasonable doubt that, when the defen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>dant committed the act, he had actual knowledge of the circumstances from which a reasonably prudent person would have known that its likely consequence would be death or great bodily harm.
