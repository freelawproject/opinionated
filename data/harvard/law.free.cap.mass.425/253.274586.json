L. c. 150A, as applied to the MBTA by G. L. c. 161A, \u00a7 19A. We vacate that judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b274-6\">The MBTA is established under G. L. c. 161 A, \u00a7 2, as \u201ca body politic and corporate and a political subdivision of the [C]ommonwealth. \u2019 \u2019 MBTA employees have been held to be public employees. <em>Hansen </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>344 Mass. 214, 218-219 (1962). General Laws c. 150A (Act), known as the \u201cBaby Wagner Act,\u201d <em>Massachusetts Port Auth., </em>CR-2940 (Labor Relations Commission 1965), secures to certain classes of employees not covered by the national labor laws, the benefits of collective bargaining. See G. L. c. 150A, \u00a7 1. See also <em>R.H. White Co. </em>v. <em>Murphy, </em>310 Mass. 510, 515 (1942). The Act established the commission as an institution, similar to the National Labor Relations Board, to enforce certain of the Act\u2019s provisions and to adjudicate disputes arising under it. G. L. c. 150A, \u00a7 7. Among its functions, the commission entertains petitions by labor organizations seeking to represent employees in a workplace subject to the commission\u2019s jurisdiction. Section 5 (a) of G. L. c. 150A states the general rule that the representatives chosen by a majority of the employees \u201cin a unit appropriate for such purposes\u201d shall be the exclusive representatives of the employees in that unit for purposes of collective bargaining. Subsection <em>(b) </em>authorizes the commission to determine the appropriate bargaining units. Subsection (c) states that \u201c[wjhenever a question . . . arises concerning the representation of employees, the commission may investigate such controversy and [after a hearing] certify . . . the representatives who have been selected.\u201d Judicial review of such determinations occurs when an affected person or organization petitions for review of a commission order or opposes a petition for enforcement. See G. L. c. 150A, \u00a7 6 <em>(e) </em>and <em>(f). </em>The court on such review may enforce, modify, or set aside the commission\u2019s order. See G. L. c. 150A, \u00a7 5 <em>(e).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b274-7\">This case arises out of a petition to the commission by the Office and Professional Employees International Union, Local 453 (union), in which the union seeks to represent certain superior officers, e.g., lieutenants and captains, of the MBTA police department. The MBTA filed a motion with the commission <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>asserting that the commission lacks jurisdiction to investigate and decide the representation issues presented by the union\u2019s petition. The MBTA\u2019s motion was based on the contention that the superior officers had been placed on the MBTA\u2019s \u201cexecutive payroll\u201d and that therefore they were \u201cexecutives\u201d to whom the provisions of G. L. c. 150A do not apply, by the terms of the statute which placed employees of the MBTA under the jurisdiction of the Act, G. L. c. 161A, \u00a7 19A. Section 19A provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b275-5\">\u201cNotwithstanding any provisions of law to the contrary, the provisions of section five of chapter one hundred and fifty A shall so far as apt apply to the authority and its employees, excepting directors, executives and those confidential employees representing the authority and dealing with employee organizations. . . .\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b275-6\">In a parallel case brought by the same union, in which the union sought to represent attorneys at the MBTA, the commission had rejected the MBTA\u2019s contention that the attorneys were \u201cexecutives\u201d for the purposes of the statute solely by reason of the MBTA\u2019s including them on the executive payroll. <em>Massachusetts Bay Transp. Auth., </em>22 M.L.C. 1111 (1995). The commission rejected the MBTA\u2019s motion to dismiss in this case on the authority of that decision, which it had announced earlier in the same month. The commission ruled that the proceedings should continue so that it could determine, by an examination of the superior officers\u2019 functions, whether these officers, placed by the MBTA on the executive payroll, could properly be designated as executives and thus outside the provisions of the Act. <em>Massachusetts Bay Transp. Auth., </em>22 M.L.C. 1161 (1995). During the pendency of these proceedings, the MBTA brought an action in the Superior Court seeking a declaration that the commission lacked jurisdiction to determine whether the officers were executives within the meaning of \u00a7 19A. The Superior Court action was stayed until the commission itself had ruled on and dismissed the same contention. Thereafter, the Superior Court judge, in an exceptionally careful and closely reasoned opinion examining the texts and legislative history of the relevant statutory provisions, concluded that by reason of \u00a7 19A, the commission had no jurisdiction over the union\u2019s petition. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>defendants appealed. We transferred the case here on our own motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b276-6\">The dispute in this case implicates two questions: whether the superior officers in their bid for unionization are covered by the provisions of G. L. c. 150A, and whether it is the commission or a court that has jurisdiction in the first instance to decide that question.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-7\">The commission, in its decision on the attorneys\u2019 petition, noted that G. L. c. 150A, like the national labor relations law, \u201ccontain[s] no specific language excluding managerial employees from an appropriate bargaining unit. However, both the Commission and the National Labor Relations Board [NLRB] have interpreted the statutes they administer to require the exclusion of managerial employees.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The leading case making this distinction under the National Labor Relations Act is <em>NLRB </em>v. <em>Bell Aerospace Co., </em>416 U.S. 267 (1974), reaffirmed in <em>NLRB </em>v. <em>Yeshiva Univ., </em>444.U.S. 672, 682-683 (1980). The commission\u2019s decisions on this issue have been in accord with those of the NLRB. <em>Brookline Hosp., </em>CR-3402 (Labor Relations Commission 1974). Whether particular employees are to be classified as managerial has been a matter for initial determination by the expert administrative agency applying the appropriate legal criteria. See <em>School Comm, of Wellesley </em>v. <em>Labor Relations Comm\u2019n, </em>376 Mass. 112, 116 (1978) (initial determination by the commission that employees were \u201cmanagerial\u201d under G. L. c. 150E is accorded deference); <em>Brookline Hosp., supra. </em>The commission went on to note in its decision in the attorneys\u2019 case that the Supreme Court in <em>Bell Aerospace Co., supra </em>at 289 n.18, had used the term \u201cexecutives\u201d as equivalent to \u201cmanagerial employees.\u201d There is no disagreement that some such distinction between managerial and nonmanagerial employees must be made. The only question is who should make it.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-8\">The MBTA contends that in effect the assignment of its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>employees to one or the other of these categories rests entirely in its unreviewable discretion. If it assigns employees to the \u201cexecutive payroll,\u201d this automatically effects the designation of those employees as \u201cexecutives\u201d and thus outside the scope of the Baby Wagner Act, since G. L. c. 161A, \u00a7 19A, provides that the Act shall not apply to \u201cexecutives.\u201d This conclusion is implausible on its face. Certainly the mere coincidence of the word \u201cexecutive\u201d in both contexts cannot seriously be contended to do the job all by itself. The structure of our .labor law as a whole evinces a legislative purpose to grant employees in those sectors to which it applies a right to bargain collectively and a grant of authority to the commission, as the expert administrative agency, to make (except where specifically excluded and subject to judicial review) determinations of the meaning and applicability of that law. See <em>Saint Luke\u2019s Hosp. </em>v. <em>Labor Relations Comm\u2019n, </em>320 Mass. 467, 469-470 (1946), and cases cited. As a matter of long-standing construction, the commission has distinguished between managerial and nonmanagerial employees. The application of that distinction is in the first instance a matter for the commission. See <em>School Comm. of Wellesley, supra; Brookline Hosp., supra. </em>It would take more than the simple coincidence of the word \u201cexecutive\u201d in \u201cexecutive payroll\u201d and \u00a7 19A to lead us to infer an intent in the Legislature to allow this particular employer to determine for itself to whom the protections of the law shall apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-5\">The judge in the Superior Court was fully aware of these considerations, but concluded that both the circumstances leading up to the passage of \u00a7 19A and a subsequent decision of the commission itself require the stringent reading of that provision proposed by the MBTA. The judge noted that \u00a7 19A was enacted as a direct response to our decision in <em>Massachusetts Bay Transp. Auth. </em>v. <em>Labor Relations Comm\u2019n, </em>356 Mass. 563 (1970), in which we held that the State\u2019s labor laws gave the commission no authority over the MBTA. We held that the statute creating the MBTA recognized it as a \u201cpolitical subdivision of the [C]ommonwealth, \u2019 \u2019 and recognized its employees as public employees whose claims and grievances were to be determined by a procedure which made no provision for the intervention of the commission. <em>Id. </em>at 565, 568. This history perhaps lends some color to the argument, which the judge did not make, that \u00a7 19A, having been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>passed to cure a jurisdictional defect, must be read so that its terms and exclusions are themselves jurisdictional. But there is no need to read the statute as depriving the commission of the authority to determine in the usual course of its proceedings to whom the statute applies, subject of course to review in the courts. See <em>East Chop Tennis Club </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Comm\u2019n Against Discrimination, </em>364 Mass. 444, 452 (1973), quoting <em>Saint Luke\u2019s Hosp., supra </em>at 470 (\u201c[wjhere the contention is that the [commission] is acting beyond its jurisdiction, the [commission] should have an opportunity to ascertain the facts and decide the question for itself\u201d). Cf. <em>Myers </em>v. <em>Bethlehem Shipbuilding Corp., </em>303 U.S. 41, 50-51 (1938). To be sure, if the commission were to wander far off course in its exercise of this primary jurisdiction, an action, such as was brought here, might be appropriate to head it off. See <em>Saint Luke\u2019s Hosp., supra </em>at 470-471 (where material facts are undisputed, only a question of law as to the commission\u2019s jurisdiction is presented, and the agency appears on the face of the facts to be clearly acting beyond the scope of its authority); <em>American Fed\u2019n of Gov\u2019t Employees </em>v. <em>Acree, </em>475 F.2d 1289, 1292 (D.C. Cir. 1973) (exhaustion of administrative remedies not required where \u201cit is clear beyond doubt that the relevant administrative agency will not grant the relief in question\u201d). But the text and the occasion that provoked it all by themselves do not suggest that the commission should be precluded from exercising its ordinary jurisdiction here.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-5\">But there is more. The judge notes that our 1970 decision involved a petition by the same union as is before us here. In that original case, the union sought to certify a bargaining unit consisting of \u201c[a]ll monthly payroll employees [of the MBTA] excluding Executive payroll employees.\u201d It was to our decision causing that petition to fail that the Legislature responded in \u00a7 19A, using the word \u201cexecutive\u201d to define an excluded class of employees. Accordingly, the judge concluded that the terms \u201cexecutive\u201d and persons \u201con the executive payroll\u201d are equivalents. This line of reasoning is strengthened by the fact that just one month after the passage of the curative legislation, G. L. c. 161A, \u00a7 19A, the union again filed a representational petition before the commission seeking to represent all employees on the monthly payroll, excluding executive, confidential, and certain other employees. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>monthly payroll included persons such as lawyers, nurses, and engineers who the MBTA at that time argued should be excluded, because, while not on the executive payroll, they performed managerial or supervisory duties or had access to confidential information. The commission rejected that argument, concluding that \u201cmanagerial, confidential and supervisory employees are entitled to collective bargaining rights under public employers\u2019 standards.\u201d <em>Massachusetts Bay Transp. Auth., </em>CR-3270 at 5 (Labor Relations Commission 1972), quoting <em>Massachusetts Port Auth., </em>CR-2940 (Labor Relations Commission 1965). Most compellingly, the commission, CR-3270 at 9, went on to mle:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b279-5\">\u201cWe have researched the judicial history of [\u00a7] 19A and conclude that the word \u2018Executives\u2019 as used in the language of the aforementioned statute shall mean those persons who have been afforded that designation by the Authority itself and who are on the Executive Payroll and not the Monthly Payroll. The Executive Payroll was created by the Employer in 1967. . . . Section 19A, was enacted in 1970 as a direct result of the decision of the Supreme Judicial Court .... We believe that [the] language [of \u00a7 19A] was drafted with the organizational structure of the Employer at that time in mind. Therefore, the exception in the statute for \u2018executives\u2019 refers to those whom the employer itself called \u2018executive\u2019, i.e. those on the Executive Payroll.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b279-6\">The legislative history, together with this contemporaneous interpretation of the statute by the expert agency charged with administering it, persuaded the judge to accept the MB-TA\u2019s argument. Although the canons of interpretation the judge deployed and the way in which she deployed them are impeccable, we still cannot accept her conclusion. The commission and the union point out that at the time of the commission\u2019s earlier decision on which the judge relied, there were only approximately twenty-one employees on the executive payroll out of a total of 6,500 employees. Today the numbers are startlingly different: there are approximately 530 employees on the executive payroll out of a total workforce of approximately 6,880. We agree with the judge that the reductio ad absurdum pressed by the union whereby the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>MBTA might exempt itself entirely from the scope of the labor laws by placing all of its employees on the executive payroll, is just that, an absurdity which would call down a swift political remedy. Nevertheless, the striking change in over-all proportions does suggest that some element of abuse may lurk in the gradual accretion of new categories to the executive payroll. Whether any such incremental accretion is reasonable or abusive is just precisely the question that would be asked by the commission in deciding whether a particular class of employee performs managerial functions.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-5\">We note also that there has been <em>a </em>change not only in the factual context of the commission\u2019s original decision, but in the legal context as well. When the commission made its original decision in 1972, the United States Supreme Court had not yet decided <em>NLRB </em>v. <em>Bell Aerospace Co., </em>416 U.S. 267 (1974), excluding managerial employees from the scope of the national labor laws and giving the criteria for doing so. Nor had the commission yet decided <em>Brookline Hosp., </em>CR-3402 (Labor Relations Commission 1974), which adopted the Supreme Court\u2019s categories and reasoning. Thus, in 1970 and 1972, there was not yet a developed body of law for dealing with the necessity of distinguishing between these two classes of employees for purposes of collective bargaining and its protections. In that state of the law, the commission quite understandably took the MBTA\u2019s own designation to the executive payroll as a reasonable proxy for a distinction which was felt to be necessary but had not yet fully matured in legal doctrine. While an administrative agency\u2019s initial and contemporaneous interpretation of its statute is particularly persuasive, see <em>Udall </em>v. <em>Tallman, </em>380 U.S. 1, 16 (1965), neither the agency nor a court must be utterly precluded by such an early interpretation from acknowledging the significance of changed circumstances. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Secretary of Health &amp; Human Servs., </em>899 F.2d 53, 62-64 (1st Cir. 1990), judgment vacated on other grounds sub nom. <em>Sullivan </em>v. <em>Massachusetts, </em>500 U.S. 949 (1991) (agency must show only a \u201creasoned basis\u201d for change in interpretation). Of course even changed circumstances would not justify a departure from the text and plain meaning of the statute. But that is not what we have here. The text speaks of executives and says nothing of the executive payroll. And it certainly does not authorize the MBTA to have the last word on who <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>shall enjoy coverage under the statute by its unilateral and unreviewable assignment of employees to the executive payroll. This is a result sufficiently out of keeping with the structure of the statute and the context of the laws governing labor management relations generally, that we would not read \u00a7 19A that way unless compelled to it. As we have sought to show, we are not.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b281-5\">The declaratory judgment is vacated. The commission may proceed to determine, subject to judicial review in the usual course, if the superior officers are managerial employees, i.e., executives within the meaning of G. L. c. 161 A, \u00a7 19A.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b276-9\">The commission noted that G. L. c. 150E, which does address this issue explicitly, is inapposite here \u201cbecause of the significant differences in the language\u201d of the two provisions. Nonetheless, it is significant that in those contexts of public employee labor relations specifically covered by G. L. c. 150E, the Legislature recognized the need to distinguish between managerial and nonmanagerial employees.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b281-7\">We also reject the MBTA\u2019s contention that G. L. c. 161A, \u00a7 19, grants the MBTA \u201cinherent management rights\u201d which preclude the commission\u2019s determining whether certain MBTA employees are \u201cexecutives\u201d within the meaning of G. L. c. 161A, \u00a7 19A. Section 19 limits the \u201cauthority [of the directors of the MBTA] to enter into collective bargaining agreements with respect to matters of inherent management right\u201d including the right \u201cto classify the various positions of the authority.\u201d This section is inapposite, however, because it limits only the authority of the directors of the MBTA to bargain away certain rights to the union. Section 19, on its face, has no effect on the authority of the commission under \u00a7 19A to determine which MBTA employees are entitled to collective bargaining rights. We see no reason to infer from \u00a7 19 that the Legislature intended these \u201cinherent management right[s]\u201d to override the authority vested in the commission to determine the scope of the labor laws.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
