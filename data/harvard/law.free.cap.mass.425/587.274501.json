Delaney, Jr., guilty of five counts of violating a protective order issued pursuant to G. L. c. 209A.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The defendant appeals from the convictions, as well as from an order denying his motion for a new trial on various grounds. We transferred the case here on our motion. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-11\">The following facts are not in dispute. On August 31, 1992, the victim, the defendant\u2019s former female companion, obtained an ex parte protective order against the defendant pursuant to G. L. c. 209A, \u00a7 4. The order stated that the defendant was to refrain from having any contact with the victim, and specifically restrained the defendant from following the victim and making telephone calls to her. The order also stated that there was to be a hearing on September 11, 1992, to determine whether the order would be extended and that the defendant \u201cmay appear, with or without an attorney, to oppose any extension or expansion of this [ojrder. If the defendant does not appear, an extended or expanded [ojrder may remain in effect for up to one year.\u201d Service of the temporary order was made by leaving a copy of it at the defendant\u2019s last and usual place of abode on September 1, 1992. On September 11, 1992, the defendant did not appear at the hearing; the order was extended for one year to September 10, 1993. The extended order contained the same <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>terms as the temporary order, but there is no evidence that the extended order was ever served on the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-5\">There was evidence from which the jury could have found the following facts. On September 14, 1992, the defendant telephoned the victim and stated, \u201cYou got a restraining order against me.\u201d The defendant offered to put a clutch in the victim\u2019s automobile for free if she would \u201cdrop\u201d the restraining order against him. The defendant again telephoned the victim on September 18, 1992, and asked the victim to \u201cgive [him] another chance.\u201d On September 28, 1992, the defendant forced the victim\u2019s automobile off the road and apparently referring to charges in an unrelated matter told her, \u201cYou are going to drop the charges or else.\u201d The defendant was arrested following this incident. On October 8, 1992, the defendant pulled his vehicle up behind the victim and asked her \u201cif [they] could handle their problems outside of court.\u201d Again, the defendant was arrested. Finally, on November 2, the defendant blocked the victim\u2019s vehicle as she tried to leave a gasoline station.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-6\">On appeal, the defendant argues that, because he never was served with the extended order he was charged with violating, the judge improperly asserted jurisdiction over this case and denied him his due process rights under the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution and art. 12 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights. The defendant also argues that the Commonwealth improperly joined the charges against him; he alleges error in the jury instructions and claims that the judge\u2019s biased treatment of defense counsel deprived him of his right to a fair trial. Finally, the defendant claims that his motion for a new trial was improperly denied because the Commonwealth\u2019s closing argument distorted the evidence against him.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b609-7\">1. <em>Failure to serve the extended order. </em>The defendant first argues that the failure to serve him with a copy of the extended order deprived the District Court judge of subject matter jurisdiction over his case. Because it is clear that the District Court had subject matter jurisdiction,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> we treat the defendant\u2019s argument as asserting that the statute requires that there be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>personal service on the defendant before he can be convicted of violating the order. We conclude that personal service of the extended order is not required.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-5\">General Laws c. 209A, \u00a7 7, requires that a copy of an order issued under \u00a7\u00a7 3, 4, or 5 of G. L. c. 209A be served on a defendant.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The defendant argues, therefore, that, absent such service, he cannot be convicted of violating an order issued pursuant to G. L. c. 209A. The defendant\u2019s argument, however, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>ignores the fact that the temporary order <em>was </em>served on him at Ms last and usual place of abode and that the evidence warranted a finding that he had knowledge of the order. TMs order warned the defendant that, if he failed to appear, \u201can extended or expanded [o]rder may remain in effect.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Section 4 mandates that \u201cthe temporary order[] shall continue in effect <em>without further order of the court\u201d </em>when the defendant fails to appear (emphasis added).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The jury could have found that the defendant had actual and constructive notice of the order and that it continued in effect after the hearing date. In these circumstances the service of the extended order on the defendant was not a prerequisite to his prosecution for violating the terms of the order. This, however, does not end our inquiry. The defendant also argues that prosecuting a defendant for violating an order that has not been served on him violates the defendant\u2019s due process rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-5\">As the defendant points out, \u201c[t]he fundamental requisite of due process is an opportumty to be heard at a meamngful time and in a meaningful manner.\u201d <em>Matter of Kenney, </em>399 Mass. 431, 435 (1987). See <em>Langlitz </em>v. <em>Board of Registration of Chiropractors, </em>396 Mass. 374, 376 (1985); <em>LaPointe </em>v. <em>License Bd. of Worcester, </em>389 Mass. 454, 458 (1983). The defendant, however, does not argue that he was deprived of an opportumty to be heard before the judge entered the extended order.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Apparently, the defendant\u2019s argument is that, because he was not served with a copy of the extended order, he was precluded from moving to have the extended order vacated. G. L. c. 209A, \u00a7 3 (\u201c[t]he court may modify its order at any subsequent time <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>upon motion by either party\u201d). The ex parte order informed the defendant that an extended order might be entered against him if he did not appear at the hearing. This information was certainly sufficient to put the defendant on notice, for \u201c[njotice of facts which would incite a person of reasonable prudence to an inquiry under similar circumstances is notice of all the facts which a reasonably diligent inquiry would develop.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Olivo, </em>369 Mass. 62, 69 (1975), quoting <em>Essex Nat\u2019l Bank </em>v. <em>Hurley, </em>16 F.2d 427, 428 (1st Cir. 1926). Indeed, a party may not \u201cshut his eyes to the means of knowledge which he knows are at hand, and thereby escape the consequences which would flow from the notice if it had actually been received.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Olivo, supra, </em>quoting <em>NLRB </em>v. <em>Local 3, Bloomingdale Dist. 65, Retail, Wholesale &amp; Dep\u2019t Store Union, </em>216 F.2d 285, 288 (2d Cir. 1954). Thus, the defendant, who with reasonable inquiry could have discovered that the temporary order had been extended, cannot be heard to complain that he was deprived of an opportunity to seek to have that extended order vacated.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-5\">Due process also requires that a person be given a \u201creasonable opportunity to know what the order prohibited, so that he might act accordingly.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Butler, </em>40 Mass. App. Ct. 906, 907 (1996). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Freiberg, </em>405 Mass. 282, 289, cert, denied, 493 U.S. 940 (1989) (due process requires that individuals receive fair notice of conduct proscribed by statute); <em>Department of Youth Servs. </em>v. <em>A Juvenile, </em>398 Mass. 516, 522 (1986) (same); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>395 Mass. 302, 304 (1985), quoting <em>Kolender </em>v. <em>Lawson, </em>461 U.S. 352, 357 (1974) (\u201cpenal statute must \u2018define the criminal offense with sufficient definiteness that ordinary people can understand what conduct is prohibited and in a manner that does not encourage arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement\u2019 \u201d). Clearly, a showing that a defendant was served with a copy of a court order is strong evidence that a defendant had knowledge that certain conduct would not be permitted and could result in a criminal conviction. The failure of such service, however, is not fatal where the Commonwealth can prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant had actual knowledge of the terms of the order. <em>Bongiovi </em>v. <em>LaBeet, </em>155 A.D.2d 320, 321 (N.Y. 1989) (\u201c[a]t any rate, respondent conceded that she was, in fact, aware of the order of protection and, therefore, personal service need not be demonstrated\u201d). Cf. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number><em>State </em>v. <em>Delap, </em>466 N.W.2d 264, 269 (Iowa Ct. App. 1990) (whether order sufficiently clear, definite and unambiguous to support contempt adjudication irrelevant because defendant had actual knowledge of \u201cno contact condition\u201d in order and consequences of violating condition). Indeed, as long as a defendant had actual knowledge of the terms of the order, there is no danger that a defendant will be convicted of conduct not known to be violative of a court order. Cf. <em>Lambert </em>v. <em>California, </em>355 U.S. 225, 229 (1957) (where there was \u201cabsence of an opportunity either to avoid the consequences of the law or to defend any prosecution brought under it,\u201d defendant\u2019s conviction violated due process).</p>\n<p id=\"b613-5\">We conclude then that the failure to serve a copy of the extended order on the defendant is not a bar to charging him with violating that order. Failure to serve the defendant, however, with a copy of the extended order is, of course, relevant to a determination as to whether the defendant possessed the knowledge required to convict him of violating the order. See note 5, <em>supra. </em>Evidence that the ex parte order delivered to the defendant\u2019s last and usual address was actually received warrants the conclusion that the defendant had actual knowledge of the terms of the extended order, as does the defendant\u2019s testimony that, following his arrest after the September 28 incident, he was aware that there was a protective order against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-6\">2. <em>Joinder. </em>Prior to trial, there was a joinder of numerous charges pending against the defendant.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The defendant argues that the offenses joined did not involve a \u201cpattern of conduct\u201d and that he was severely prejudiced by the joining of these charges. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-7\">A decision on \u201cwhether joinder is appropriate is committed to the sound discretion of the trial judge.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Montanez, </em>410 Mass. 290, 303 (1991). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Shelton, </em>37 Mass. App. Ct. 964, 964 (1994). The defendant bears the burden of demonstrating that prejudice will <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>result from a failure to sever the charges. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gallison, </em>383 Mass. 659, 671 (1981). Indeed, Mass. R. Crim. R 9 (a) (3), 378 Mass. 859 (1979), provides that where offenses are related, \u201c[t]he trial judge shall join the charges for trial unless he determines that joinder is not in the best interests of justice.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b614-5\">Related offenses are defined in part as \u201carising] out of a course of criminal conduct or series of criminal episodes connected together or constituting parts of a single scheme or plan.\u201d Mass. R. Crim. P. 9 (a) (1), 378 Mass. 859 (1979). We have stated that offenses are related if the evidence \u201cin its totality shows a common scheme and pattern of operation that tends to prove all the indictments.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Feijoo, </em>419 Mass. 486, 494-495 (1995). Time and space play an important role in determining whether offenses are related offenses for the purposes of joinder. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mamay, </em>407 Mass. 412, 417 (1990); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cruz, </em>373 Mass. 676, 690 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b614-6\">In the instant case, the judge joined for trial the charges of violating a c. 209A order, stalking, and intimidating a witness. All the incidents giving rise to the charges involved the same victim. All the incidents occurred between September and November of 1992; indeed, the six counts of c. 209A violations, which include the five counts of which the defendant was ultimately convicted, occurred within an approximate eight-week period. Thus, the offenses charged demonstrated a pattern of conduct by the defendant toward the victim because of his unhappiness with the ending of their relationship and his desire to reunite with her. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Feijoo, supra </em>at 495 (joinder appropriate where offenses indicated scheme whereby defendant used his position as karate teacher to induce students to engage in homosexual activity); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mamay, supra </em>at 416 (joinder appropriate where offenses indicated scheme whereby defendant used his position of authority and trust to commit sexual crimes on female patients visiting his office). As such, evidence of each offense would have been admissible at trials for a separate offense. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Feijoo, supra. </em>Indeed, if the charges were tried separately, much testimony would be duplicated at each trial merely establishing the relationship between the victim and the defendant. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hoppin, </em>387 Mass. 25, 32 (1982) (\u201c(\u00a1joinder may promote economy in the trial of criminal offenses, particularly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>when the same witnesses will testify concerning more than one offense\u201d). Finally, we note that, in the instant case, the defendant has failed to demonstrate that he was prejudiced by the joinder of these offenses. The defendant\u2019s burden is \u201cnot satisfied by a showing merely that the defendant\u2019s chances for acquittal would have been better had the [complaints] been tried separately.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Montanez, supra </em>at 304. Rather, the defendant\u2019s burden is to show that \u201cthe prejudice resulting from a joint trial is so compelling that it prevented] [him] from obtaining a fair trial.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Clarke, </em>418 Mass. 207, 217 (1994), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Moran, </em>387 Mass. 644, 658 (1982). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ferraro, </em>424 Mass. 87, 90 (1997). In the instant case, the jury acquitted the defendant of the stalking charge and the charge that he intimidated a witness. The defendant was also acquitted of one of the counts charging him with violating a protective order. Thus, it is clear th\u00e1t the jury carefully considered the evidence with regard to each crime charged.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-5\">3. <em>Jury instructions. </em>The defendant argues that, in order to be convicted of violating a c. 209A order, the Commonwealth must show a manifest intent on the part of the defendant to violate that order. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-6\">The judge instructed the jury that, in order to convict the defendant of the crime of violating a c. 209A order, the Commonwealth must prove \u201cfirst . . . that a court had issued an order pursuant to Chapter 209A of our General Laws, which ordered the defendant to refrain from abusing the alleged victim. Second, that such order was in effect on the date that this violation of the order allegedly occurred. Third, that the defendant knew that the pertinent terms of the order were in effect, either by having received a copy of the order or in some other way. And fourth, that the defendant violated the order by failing to vacate the household or by abusing alleged victim.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b615-7\">The defendant argues that this charge was erroneous because, by allowing the jury to convict the defendant based solely on the fact that there was a violation of the order instead of requiring a finding that the defendant intended to violate the order, the instruction lowered the Commonwealth\u2019s burden of proof. The defendant urges us to look to the law of contempt and conclude that an essential element of the crime of violating a c. 209A order is a finding that the defendant intended to violate the order. Because there was no objection at trial, we review the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>charge to determine whether it \u201cwas so erroneous that it created a \u2018substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Preziosi, </em>399 Mass. 748, 751 (1987), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Murray, </em>396 Mass. 702, 705 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b616-5\">We have read \u00a7 7 as limiting to the enumerated offenses those actions which will constitute a criminal violation of G. L. c. 209A. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gordon, </em>407 Mass. 340, 345 (1990). All other violations of a c. 209A order cannot be prosecuted as a statutory offense; rather, they can be prosecuted as criminal contempt. Commentary to \u00a7 8:02 of the Guidelines for Judicial Practice: Abuse Prevention Proceedings (Oct. 1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b616-6\">In order to prove a defendant guilty of criminal contempt, the Commonwealth must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that \u201cthere was a clear, outstanding order of the court, that the defendant knew of that order, and that the defendant clearly and intentionally disobeyed that order in circumstances in which he was able to obey it.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Brogan, </em>415 Mass. 169, 171 (1993), quoting <em>Furtado </em>v. <em>Furtado, </em>380 Mass. 137, 145 (1980). See <em>United Factory Outlet, Inc. </em>v. <em>Jay\u2019s Stores, Inc., </em>361 Mass. 35, 45 (1972) (Tauro, C.J., concurring) (\u201c[t]he rule that intent is not an element of civil contempt is a direct consequence of the separate functions of criminal and civil contempt\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b616-7\">While intent is an element of criminal contempt proceedings, \u00a7 7 of G. L. c. 209A establishes a distinct statutory crime for certain violations of c. 209A orders. The statute does not speak explicitly to the defendant\u2019s state of mind; it is conceded, however, by the Commonwealth that, in order to convict a defendant of violating an order, it must be proved beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant knew of the order. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Crosscup, </em>369 Mass. 228, 234 (1975) (\u201cclear statutory language would be needed ... to buttress an interpretation that knowledge was irrelevant\u201d); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Wallace, </em>14 Mass. App. Ct. 358, 364 (1982) (\u201c[bjecause traditionally, at common law, some element of intent or knowledge was required before punishment could be imposed . . . and because due process considerations may, in some cases, require some degree of notice . . . courts are reluctant to infer a legislative intent to impose absolute liability\u201d [citations omitted]). This statute, however, requires no more knowledge than that the defendant knew of the order. We decline to read <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>any additional mens rea requirements into the statute.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> <em>Simon </em>v. <em>Solomon, </em>385 Mass. 91, 103 (1982) (\u201c[although the requirement of due process places some limits on legislative power to penalize innocent conduct, legislatures generally have broad power to define and limit the mens rea element of criminal offenses\u201d); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Jackson, </em>369 Mass. 904, 909 (1976) (\u201cLegislature has great latitude to determine what conduct should be regarded as criminal and to prescribe penalties to vindicate the legitimate interests of society\u201d). The defendant does not argue that the failure of the statute to require a showing of intentional violation is unconstitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-5\">4. <em>Failure to allow certain arguments. </em>The defendant also argues that the judge erred in failing to allow the defendant to pursue certain avenues of argument.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The defendant attempts to cite five instances where the judge improperly discarded the defendant\u2019s arguments. We think that this argument is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-6\">At trial, the defendant did not object to the judge\u2019s rulings, instructions, or comments. Therefore, we examine whether the judge\u2019s actions constituted a \u201csubstantial risk of a miscarriage of justice.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Boyer, </em>400 Mass. 52, 59 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b617-7\">The first occasion occurred during.the defendant\u2019s opening statement where defense counsel made the following comment: \u201c[The victim] has a motive in this trial, and you will hear it. She has a credibility problem, you will find out, that she has a hard time telling the truth.\u201d Following an objection by the prosecutor, the judge instmcted: \u201cThe credibility and believability of witnesses is the sole province of the jurors. Refrain from making comment.\u201d There was no error. Defense counsel\u2019s statement was improper argument. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Dinitz, </em>424 U.S. 600, 612 (1976) (Burger, C.J., concurring). The judge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>did not create a. substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice with his instruction. The defendant\u2019s second instance involved his discussion of a note left on a witness\u2019s automobile that related that the defendant \u201chad tried to break [the victim\u2019s] arm\u201d and that he was \u201cviolent.\u201d The judge reminded the jury that the opening statements were not evidence. The judge acted properly because the evidence from the note regarding the victim\u2019s arm was inadmissible hearsay and therefore improper to discuss as evidence during opening statements. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Murray, </em>22 Mass. App. Ct. 984, 985 (1986). The note was not offered as an exhibit.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-5\">The next two allegations of error involve the judge\u2019s refusal to allow the defense to pursue during cross-examination a line of argument that the victim had been on welfare. The defense contended that the issue was relevant to the defendant\u2019s credibility. Despite being given an opportunity to do so, the defense was unable to produce a relevant link between the victim\u2019s welfare status and her credibility. These rulings were not erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-6\">The defendant argues that the judge\u2019s instructions to the jury on an employer\u2019s obligation to report monies paid to employees did not permit the defense\u2019s point to reach the jury. However, the fact that the witness evaded taxes did reach the jury.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The judge\u2019s instruction to the jury merely clarified the distinction between the employer\u2019s obligation to report income and the employee\u2019s obligation to file a tax return. An error, if any, on the part of the judge was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>5. <em>Closing argument. </em>The defendant also argues that the prosecutor misstated the evidence in her closing argument. He claims that the prosecutor mislead the jury by implying that the proof of service was for the permanent order, rather than for the temporary order. We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-5\">Because the defendant failed to object to the closing argument, the standard of review is whether the prosecutor\u2019s argument created a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mello, </em>420 Mass. 375 (1995); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Marquetty, </em>416 Mass. 445, 450 (1993); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Kozec, 399 </em>Mass. 514, 518 n.8 (1987). Under that standard, \u201c[w]e analyze the remarks in \u2018light of the \u201centire argument, as well as in light of the judge\u2019s instruction to the jury and the evidence at trial.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Marquetty, supra, </em>quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Yesilciman, </em>406 Mass. 736, 746 (1990). The defendant\u2019s argument, however, ignores that standard and focuses on one sentence out of context. To adopt the defendant\u2019s position we would have to abandon our responsibility to analyze the prosecutor\u2019s remarks in light of the entire argument. See <em>Marquetty, supra </em>at 445.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-6\">Read in context, the relevant portion of the Commonwealth\u2019s closing argument breaks down into two distinct parts. The first part of the excerpt addresses the process through which the victim obtained a restraining order against the defendant. The second half of the excerpt switches to the defendant\u2019s claim that he never received the original temporary restraining order. The Commonwealth simply highlighted the return of service from the temporary order.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The prosecutor was entitled to reply to the defendant\u2019s main contention that he had never received the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>temporary or the extended order.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The prosecutor\u2019s reply was based on evidence admitted during the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-5\">The defendant argues that it was never brought out that a copy of the extended order was not served on him. However, that fact was brought out during the trial by the defendant and in the defendant\u2019s closing.

We do not agree. Examination and cross-examination of the defendant on the temporary order do not show that the parties focused solely on proof of service of the extended order. When the exhibit was introduced, it was introduced as the restraining order in effect against the defendant without reference to the return of service because that return was not yet at issue. Despite an effort to do so, the dissent cannot point to any instance in the transcript where the prosecutor stated or implied that the return of service was for the extended order. As we read the record, the prosecutor\u2019s challenge, see <em>post </em>at note 5, went to the defendant\u2019s testimony that he had not received the temporary order which was left at his last and usual home address.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b621-9\">The temporary order, left at the defendant\u2019s last and usual address, referred to a hearing date of September 11, 1992, and included the statement that \u201c[i]f the defendant does not appear [at the scheduled hearing], an extended or expanded Order may remain in effect for up to one year.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b621-10\">Before any evidence was presented, the judge told the jury: \u201cIf one of the attorneys or I refer to some part of the evidence, and that does not coincide with what your recollection is, it is your recollection which you are to follow in your deliberation, not the attorneys or not mine.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b621-11\">After the closing arguments had concluded, the judge again instructed the jury: \u201cThe opening statements and the closing arguments of the lawyers are not a substitute for the evidence.

Accordingly, I dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-5\">It should be kept in mind that, although two protective orders issued against the defendant \u2014 a temporary order and an extended order \u2014 only one order, the extended order, formed the basis of the defendant\u2019s conviction. The temporary order expired on September 11, 1992.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-6\">During closing argument, the prosecutor stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b622-7\">\u201c[At] the end of August of 1992, [the complainant] went to Lawrence District Court. . . .

I would suggest that\u2019s a little too convenient.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b623-5\">The court reads a paragraph break immediately prior to the prosecutor\u2019s reference to the return of service, and after so doing, asserts that \u201cread in context\u201d the Commonwealth\u2019s closing argument breaks down into two distinct parts, one part addressing the process by which the complainant obtained a protective order against the defendant and one part addressing the defendant\u2019s claim that he never received the original temporary protective order. <em>Ante </em>at 599-600 &amp; n.12. The Commonwealth, however, did not argue that the prosecutor was making two distinct arguments, nor does the reproduction of the argument in the Commonwealth\u2019s brief insert a paragraph break.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>1 contend that, read in context, it is clear that the prosecutor was improperly suggesting to the jury that what was in front of them was proof of service of the extended order when no such proof existed. Indeed, the prosecutor\u2019s reference to the extended order, which the Commonwealth concedes was not served on the defendant, is immediately preceded by the prosecutor\u2019s reference to September 11, 1992, the date the complainant obtained the extended order. Moreover immediately following is a reference to testimony that was elicited by the prosecutor alluding to the extended order. See note 5, <em>infra. </em>Furthermore, the prosecutor referred to \u201ca piece of paper given to [the defendant] by a police officer.\u201d Not even the temporary order was given to the defendant by a police officer; rather, the proof of service of the temporary order states that it was left at the defendant\u2019s last and usual address: thus the prosecutor compounded the misstatement she made earlier in her argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-6\">Because the prosecutor referred both to service and to proof of service which did not exist, her argument misstated the evidence and was improper. It is well settled that \u201c[a] prosecutor must limit comment in closing statement to the evidence and fair inferences that can be drawn from the evidence.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Kelly, </em>417 Mass. 266, 270 (1994). See <em>Com</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number><em>monwealth </em>v. <em>Kozec, </em>399 Mass. 514, 516 (1987); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Shelley, </em>374 Mass. 466, 472 (1978), <em>S.C., </em>381 Mass. 340 (1980), and 411 Mass. 692 (1992). Moreover, the prosecutor\u2019s statement cannot be characterized as responding to the defendant\u2019s argument that there was no service at all. The thrust of the defendant\u2019s argument was that he did not receive either order and was not aware at least until September 28, 1992, of the existence of a protective order. In support of this claim the defendant offered testimony to the effect that he did not spend a lot of time at the address where the temporary order was left and emphasized that no order was served in hand. More importantly, while the prosecutor was entitled to reply to the defendant\u2019s contention, she was not entitled to rebut his contention by stating that proof of service of the extended order would be before the jury and that he had been given written notice by a police officer when those facts were not in evidence.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b624-5\">In the face of such prosecutorial error, several factors must be considered, including whether the argument was seasonably objected to; whether the error was limited to collateral issues or went to the heart of the case; whether the judge\u2019s instructions to the jury may have mitigated the error; and generally, whether the error, in the circumstances, possibly made a difference in the jury\u2019s conclusion. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Kozec, supra </em>at 517-518; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pavao, </em>34 Mass. App. Ct. 577, 581 (1993). Because the argument here was not objected to, review is limited to whether a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice has occurred. Where the evidence before the jury has been distorted, however, \u201cwe have recognized that the failure to object and possibly obtain a curative instruction may be the very thing which permits the remarks to have their maximum prejudicial effect.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Shelley, supra </em>at 469. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Nordstrom, </em>364 Mass. 310, 314 (1973). See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cifizzari, </em>397 Mass. 560, 578 (1986); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fitzgerald, </em>376 Mass. 402, 416 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b625-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>Clearly, the defendant\u2019s knowledge of the protective order and the terms it contained were crucial elements of the Commonwealth\u2019s case. Indeed, without proving beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant knew of the existence of the order, the defendant could not be convicted of violating the order. Thus, this \u201cis not a case in which overreaching argument was confined to collateral issues only.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Shelley, supra </em>at 470. Moreover, the judge\u2019s instructions on the mental state element of the crime emphasized that the Commonwealth had to prove that the defendant had actual knowledge of the terms of the extended order, the very issue to which the prosecutor\u2019s improper arguments referred. Thus, absent specific instructions that mitigated the error, I do not believe that the judge\u2019s reminder to the jury that closing statements are not evidence cured the prejudicial impact of the prosecutor\u2019s argument. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rosa, </em>412 Mass. 147, 160 (1992) (curative instruction regarding the prosecutor\u2019s improper closing argument not sufficient and new trial required given the importance to the Commonwealth\u2019s case of the issue that was part of improper argument); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Clary, </em>388 Mass. 583, 591 (1983) (\u201cjudge\u2019s instructions to the jury, which stated only in general terms that the arguments of counsel are not evidence did not cure adequately the prejudicial impact of the prosecutor\u2019s assertion\u201d); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pavao, supra </em>at 581-582 (where prosecutor misstated evidence by improperly attributing to defendant a statement indicating defendant acted with intent necessary to be convicted of murder, new trial required even though judge did instruct the jury that closing arguments were not evidence because there were not forceful statements by judge that argument was inappropriate and should be disregarded); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Shelley, supra </em>(where overreaching argument not confined to collateral issues only, adequate curative instructions did not render the prosecutorial misconduct harmless).</p>\n<p id=\"b625-5\">The court suggests that the parties knew that the defendant had not been served with a copy of the extended order and chose to use their closing statements to argue whether the defendant received a copy of the temporary order \u2014 a doubtful proposition particularly where, until today, a reading of the statute would suggest that a defendant must be served with a copy of the order he was charged with violating. I believe that a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>fairer and more plausible reading of the testimony and the closing arguments suggests that both defense counsel<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and the prosecutor<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> operated as if the proof of service before them was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>proof of service of the extended order, an error that makes the distortion of the evidence during the prosecutor\u2019s closing argument even more significant.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-5\">Given that the outcome of the case essentially depended on whether the jury believed the complainant\u2019s or the defendant\u2019s version of events, the suggestion that the defendant was served with a copy of the extended order could very well have influenced the jury\u2019s assessment of the defendant\u2019s credibility and thus, their verdict. Indeed, this is hardly a case where there is overwhelming evidence of the defendant\u2019s guilt. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Clary, supra </em>at 593; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Shelley, supra. </em>Contrast <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>DeChristoforo, </em>360 Mass. 531, 538 (1971) (overwhelming evidence of guilt neutralizing prosecutorial misconduct). Thus, it is impossible to say that the improper argument, which undermined the defendant\u2019s credibility and went to a crucial issue in the case, did not make a difference in the jury\u2019s verdict, and I would order a new trial for the defendant. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Kelly, </em>417 Mass. 266, 271 (1994) (where improper argument went to police credibility, the crux of the case, new trial was necessary); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Clary, supra </em>at 593 (where argument of prosecutor struck at defendant\u2019s sole defense, that error contributed to conclusion that new trial was warranted); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Shelley, supra </em>at 470-471 (argument as to credibility of expert witness urging an inference that expert testimony was purchased \u201cstruck impermissibly, at the defendant\u2019s sole defense\u201d and warranted a new trial).</p>\n<p id=\"b627-6\">Finally, I agree that great trust should be and is placed in the citizens who serve as jurors, for they are the foundation of our justice system. Where the evidence is distorted, however, it is unfair to those very jurors to place on them the burden of cor-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number>reeling or overlooking a prosecutor\u2019s mistake.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Indeed, a jury\u2019s verdict can be only as fair as the trial allows. I would therefore reverse the defendant\u2019s convictions and order a new trial.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b622-11\">GeneraI Laws c. 209A, \u00a7 7, states in pertinent part: \u201cWhenever the court orders under . . .

The law enforcement agency <em>shall </em>promptly make its return of service to the court\u201d (emphasis added).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b623-7\">Indeed, the Commonwealth reproduces the same portion of the argument reproduced here and characterizes the argument as referring to \u201cthe issue of notice and to the service of the protective order.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b624-6\">The court reasons from evidence of a previous protective order obtained against the defendant \u201cthat the defendant knew of the process of how a protective order begins as a temporary order and then may be extended after a hearing.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 591 n.5. It should be noted, however, that, while there was evidence that the complainant had obtained protective orders against the defendant in the past, she had also, on at least one occasion, failed to appear at the hearing as required in order to get the temporary order extended. Thus, in the defendant\u2019s experience, notice of a temporary order did not necessarily mean that an extended order would follow; the absence of any service of an extended order could only have buttressed this conclusion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b626-5\">A review of several portions of the transcript indicates that defense counsel had confused the return of service of the temporary order as a return of service of the extended order. Indeed, when defense counsel moved for a directed verdict, alleging that the Commonwealth had not proved that the defendant had known of the existence of the order he was charged with violating (the extended order), she stated: \u201cUnder the facts that on that restraining order that they have entered into evidence, they have not proven that the defendant . . . either knew of the pertinent terms of the order were in effect by either having received a copy of the order or in some other way. The reason I would state that, Your Honor, is looking at the return of service checked off as leaving a copy at the defendant\u2019s last and usual address as shown on this order, Your Honor, that doesn\u2019t constitute proof that [the defendant] had any knowledge of the effect of this order. And he had no \u2014 it does not prove that he had knowledge of any portion of the order.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b626-6\">In addition, in her own closing argument, defense counsel argued: \u201cLook at the restraining order. The Commonwealth has to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that [the defendant] knew about the restraining order. Did he receive it in hand from a police officer? No. Could [the complainant] have told the police officer, well, he\u2019s never at that 35 Groton Street address, go to his parents\u2019 house .... She never told him that. If she told him that, maybe it would have gotten served. And who better to know [the defendant\u2019s] schedule, where he is? She knew when she went into court, she knew where that restraining order was going to be. Could she have gone and taken the restraining order? Could she have orchestrated his arrest?\u201d Certainly, it would seem likely that, in both examples, if defense counsel was aware that the extended order had not been served on the defendant she would have just said so in her argument to both the judge and the jury.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b626-7\">Indeed, when the defendant was being cross-examined by the prosecutor, the prosecutor showed the defendant a copy of the extended order that had been introduced in evidence as the extended order obtained by the complainant on September 11, 1992. The defendant then testified that he lived at the address indicated on the order and received his mail there. The prosecutor then challenged the defendant\u2019s testimony that he did not receive a copy of the extended order in the following exchange:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b626-8\">The prosecutor: \u201cYou receive any and all correspondence that is sent to you at 35 Groton Street; isn\u2019t that correct?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b626-9\">The defendant: \u201cYes. What\u2019s your point now?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b626-10\">The prosecutor: \u201cBut you didn\u2019t receive <em>this </em>restraining order that was sent to you; is that correct?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b626-11\">The defendant: \u201cNo, I did not.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b626-12\">I would suggest that this exchange supports the inference that the prosecutor, who challenges the defendant\u2019s contention that he did not receive a copy of the extended order, was operating as if the proof of service before her was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>proof of service of the extended order. Indeed, she goes on to elicit testimony regarding what would happen to mail if left by a police officer with the defendant\u2019s brother at the 35 Groton Street address or in the mailbox.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-8\">In addition, in responding to the defendant\u2019s motion for a directed verdict, the prosecutor argued: \u201cWith regards to the . . . three counts of violations of restraining orders .... Judge, you have before you that is placed into evidence the service of the restraining order, that it has been left at the defendant\u2019s last and usual address, that being I believe, 35 Groton Street.\u201d I suggest that this reference to the return of service, coupled with the reference to the order in evidence, demonstrates that the prosecutor was acting as if the proof of service before the court was proof of service of the extended order.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b628-5\">The copy of the order is confusing at best apparently because the same piece of paper was used to indicate the existence and service of both. Thus, a \u201ccursory glance\u201d might give the impression to the jury that the order which had been served on the defendant was the order he was charged with violating.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
