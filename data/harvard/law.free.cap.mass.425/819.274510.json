After sentencing, the trial judge, sua sponte, set aside the guilty verdicts and ordered a new trial. See Mass. R. Grim. P. 25 (b) (2), 378 Mass. 896 (1979). The Commonwealth appeals from that order and the judge\u2019s subsequent order denying the Commonwealth\u2019s motion for reconsideration. We vacate the order setting side the verdicts and ordering a new <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"820\">*820</page-number>trial, with the result that the jury\u2019s verdicts of guilty of murder in the first degree and rape are to be reinstated.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b840-6\">The Commonwealth sought to introduce in evidence deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) test results to establish that the defendant was the source of semen recovered from an autopsy swabbing of the victim\u2019s mouth. Forensic testing by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), using the Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism (RFLP) method of analysis of DNA,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> concluded that DNA extracted from the semen from the victim\u2019s mouth matched DNA extracted from a sample of the defendant\u2019s blood.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-7\">Prior to trial, the defendant filed a motion in limine seeking to exclude any use of or reference to DNA evidence. The defendant did not challenge the RFLP analysis,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> but argued only that the statistical model used by the FBI to determine the probability that the DNA match might be random was not admissible under <em>United States </em>v. <em>Frye, </em>293 F. 1013 (D.C. Cir. 1923), and <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Curnin, </em>409 Mass. 218 (1991).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> On November 8, 1993, the trial judge conducted a voir dire hearing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"821\">*821</page-number>to determine the admissibility of the DNA evidence. Supervisory Special Agent John Mertens of the FBI, appearing as an expert witness for the Commonwealth, described the DNA profiling process used by the FBI in this case. Using a statistical model known as the product rule,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Mertens estimated that the probability of the DNA sample obtained from the autopsy swabbing of the victim\u2019s mouth matching at random someone other than the defendant was one in 800,000.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b841-5\">The product rule now meets the test of scientific reliability stated in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lanigan, </em>419 Mass. 15, 16 (1994) <em>(Lanigan II). </em>See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rosier, ante </em>807, 813-814 (1997). But its use has been \u2014 and was at the time of the hearing \u2014 a subject of controversy. In 1992, the National Research Council (NRC)<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> published a report, entitled DNA Technology in Forensic Science (hereinafter the 1992 NRC Report), in which concerns about the product rale were noted: some scientists had concluded that genetic subpopulations might exist within a large genetic database population and might affect the statistical calculation used to determine the significance of a DNA match. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"822\">*822</page-number>To account for this possibility, the 1992 NRC Report recommended the use of a \u201cceiling frequency\u201d for all DNA frequency calculations, known as the \u201cceiling principle.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> See generally <em>Lanigan II, supra </em>at 21. When used to calculate the probability of a DNA match in the general population, the ceiling principle was believed by some scientists to produce a more conservative estimate of the frequency with which a person\u2019s particular allele would appear in randomly selected population groups, and was thus thought to be more favorable to defendants than the product rule. See <em>Lanigan II, supra </em>at 23, and cases cited. Even at the time of the voir dire hearing in this case, however, the criticisms of the product rule were being questioned. The defendant\u2019s expert witness, Laurence D. Mueller, testified that some population geneticists had taken the position that the ceiling principle is not based on sound science and is unnecessary, while others had pointed out that the ceiling principle will not always result in a conservative estimate of a DNA profile frequency, and that in some cases it may result in a DNA profile frequency estimate that is more rare than it should be.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-5\">At the voir dire hearing Mertens testified that the FBI did not agree with the NRC about the existence of genetic subpopulations. Nevertheless, he said, the FBI had conducted an additional statistical analysis in this case using the ceiling principle. Calculated according to that principle, he said the chance of a random match of DNA from the autopsy swabbing from the victim and someone other than the defendant would be approximately one in 159,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-6\">Because the defendant\u2019s expert was not available at the time of the voir dire hearing, the judge made no ruling at that time; the evidence was closed \u201ctemporarily,\u201d subject to an expert\u2019s being called by the defendant. The trial commenced on November 29, 1993. On December 1, 1993, although the defendant had still called no DNA expert to testify, the judge again heard arguments from counsel concerning the admissibility of the Commonwealth\u2019s DNA evidence. The judge denied the defendant\u2019s motion in limine on December 6. On December 8, Mertens was called by the Commonwealth to testify. He told the jury that there was a match between the defendant\u2019s DNA <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"823\">*823</page-number>and the DNA from the semen found in the victim\u2019s mouth. He also testified that, using the ceiling principle, the probability of the DNA sample obtained from the autopsy swabbing of the victim\u2019s mouth matching at random someone other than the defendant was approximately one in 150,000. Mertens\u2019s testimony before the jury included no discussion of any analysis using the product rule.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The following day, with the agreement of the Commonwealth, the judge reopened the voir dire hearing, and the defendant called Laurence D. Mueller as an expert witness. He testified outside the presence of the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-5\">The only basis on which Mueller sought to challenge the Commonwealth\u2019s DNA evidence concerned the FBI\u2019s purported failure to follow certain procedural steps in connection with its statistical analyses using the ceiling principle.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> He explained .that the 1992 NRC Report contained several \u201cpermanent\u201d and \u201cinterim\u201d recommendations on statistical evaluations of DNA evidence using the ceiling principle,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> and that the procedure the FBI had followed to calculate the probability of a DNA random <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"824\">*824</page-number>match using the interim ceiling principle departed from the recommendations made in the 1992 NRC Report. The FBI did not apply the \u201ccounting method,\u201d it failed to use all of the population databases available to it and, he said, the FBI did not follow NRC recommendations in the method the FBI used to estimate individual DNA band frequencies, called the \u201cfixed bin\u201d system; the NRC recommended the \u201cfloating bin\u201d method.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Using a larger sample of databases than those used by the FBI, and employing three different \u201cbin\u201d calculations, Dr. Mueller testified that he had conducted his own interim ceiling principle analysis of the DNA samples in this case, and that the likelihood of a random match was one in 136, one in 351, or one in 4,300.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b844-5\">A few days after Dr. Mueller had given his voir dire testimony, and as the trial progressed, the judge denied the defendant\u2019s attempt to exclude the testimony of Mertens that the jury previously had heard. Dr. Mueller never testified before the jury. On December 17, 1993, the jury convicted the defendant. The defendant promptly moved pursuant to rule 25 (b) (2) that the judge enter verdicts of not guilty, or order a new trial. The judge denied the motion. On January 7, 1994, the defendant was sentenced to life in prison pursuant to G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 1, on the murder conviction, and to a concurrent life sentence on the rape conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-6\">On February 11, 1994, the judge sua sponte issued a statement on the record in which he said that he had reconsidered the defendant\u2019s postconviction motion under rule 25 (b) (2), and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"825\">*825</page-number>that he would, as a matter of law, allow the motion, set aside the verdicts, and order a new trial. On March 31, 1994, the judge issued findings of fact and rulings of law in which he explained his decision; he concluded that the significance of the DNA match analyzed under the ceiling principle was not scientifically reliable and that the Commonwealth\u2019s DNA evidence should have been excluded. On November 23, 1994, the Commonwealth moved for reconsideration of the judge\u2019s decision, in light of <em>Lanigan II,</em><footnotemark><em>13</em></footnotemark><em> </em>which the motion judge denied on March 16, 1995. He ruled that although <em>Lanigan II </em>had determined that the ceiling principle was a reliable statistical methodology, the decision did not establish a per se rule as to the admissibility of the analysis in every case. Rather, the judge reasoned, his focus was \u201con whether the calculation procedure employed by the FBI in this case was a true and accurate execution of the ceiling principle.\u201d He concluded that the FBI\u2019s interim ceiling principle analysis was inadmissible because the FBI had failed to follow the recommendations in the 1992 NRC Report.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-5\">n</p>\n<p id=\"b845-6\">Under rule 25 (b) (2),<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> a trial judge has the discretion to award a new trial on the ground that the verdict, although supported by legally sufficient evidence, is against the weight of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"826\">*826</page-number>the evidence, or because the integrity of the evidence is suspect. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Doucette, </em>408 Mass. 454, 456 (1990), and cases cited. It is clear here that the judge\u2019s decision to set aside the verdicts and to award a new trial was grounded solely on his conclusion that the FBI\u2019s use of the interim ceiling principle to calculate the DNA profile frequency was not scientifically reliable. Because of developments that have occurred since his ruling, which we describe below, we conclude that in this case the judge\u2019s order must be vacated.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-5\">In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Vao Sok, ante </em>787, 796-798 (1997), we today explain the standard we exercise when reviewing a trial judge\u2019s ruling on the admissibility of scientific evidence.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> First, when examining a trial judge\u2019s determination of the scientific validity of \u00e1 particular methodology we said that \u201cour review is de novo because a trial judge\u2019s conclusion will have applicability beyond the facts of the case before him.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 797. Once we resolve the issue of the over-all scientific validity of the particular methodology, our review of the judge\u2019s rulings on admissibility \u201cturns to traditional evidentiary inquiries.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 798. At this stage \u201c[t]he burden is on the proponent to show that the testifying expert properly performed a scientifically valid methodology in arriving at his opinion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 798, and cases cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-6\">Applying these standards of review, we turn to the judge\u2019s rulings concerning the admissibility of the Commonwealth\u2019s DNA evidence, in particular the scientific reliability of the statistical models used by the Commonwealth to describe the significance of the DNA match. This requires that we describe first a development in the relev\u00e1nt scientific community that occurred after the posttrial motions in this case. In 1996 the NRC issued a new report entitled The Evaluation of Forensic DNA Evidence (1996 NRC Report), in which the NRC revised its earlier view on the ceiling principle analysis. The 1996 NRC Report at 5 recommended that in general the calculation of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"827\">*827</page-number>DNA profile frequency should be made using the product rule.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> The NRC noted that it shared the view of those scientists who had criticized the ceiling principle \u201con practical and statistical grounds\u201d and who see \u201cno scientific justification\u201d for the use of the ceiling principle. It agreed, it said, with the \u201cwide[] criticisms\u201d of the interim ceiling principle.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> The 1996 NRC Report concluded that \u201csufficient data have been gathered to establish that neither ceiling principle is needed.\u201d<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 35. The 1996 NRC Report also determined that the counting method was not required: \u201cSince we believe that the abundant data make the ceiling principles unnecessary, this is true <em>a fortiori </em>for the direct counting method.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 159. We conclude that neither the ceiling principle nor the interim ceiling principle is required for DNA profile frequencies.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-5\">The judge did not, of course, have the benefit of the 1996 NRC Report. In his 1994 ruling, made before our decision <em>Lanigan II, </em>he concluded that the ceiling principle, and its application here, did not meet the requirements of scientific reliability. In his March, 1995, order denying the Commonwealth\u2019s motion to reconsider, he \u201cassume[d] without deciding\u201d that the ceiling and interim ceiling principles were scientifically valid, but concluded that the FBI\u2019s application of the interim ceiling principle was unreliable. It is now clear that the concerns that the judge had, both with respect to the interim ceiling principle <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"828\">*828</page-number>generally and as applied by the FBI in this case, are no longer valid.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-5\">As described above, the 1996 NRC Report repudiated the need for the ceiling principle analysis, and any possible failings of the FBI in executing the ceiling principle (and, in light of that Report, we are not persuaded that there were any such failings) are also laid to rest.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Moreover, there is nothing on this record to suggest that the FBI\u2019s analysis using the product rule to calculate the DNA profile frequency was invalid. In these circumstances we conclude that there is no prejudice to the defendant by the admission of the Commonwealth\u2019s DNA profile frequency evidence.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> The jury convicted the defendant in the face of the FBI expert\u2019s testimony at trial that the likeli<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"829\">*829</page-number>hood of the DNA match with the defendant occurring at random was one in 150,000. The FBI expert testified at the voir dire hearing (but not at trial) that the probability of a random match using the product rule was one in 800,000. That result, if introduced in evidence, would have been far more prejudicial to the defendant than the results of the FBI\u2019s analysis using the ceiling principle.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b849-5\">In our two-pronged review of the admission of scientific evidence, we afford great deference to the decisions of trial judges concerning the reliability of the application of a scientific technique in a particular case. But in this case all of the judge\u2019s concerns stem from challenges to the ceiling principle that have since been resolved by the 1996 NRC Report and related studies.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-6\">The order setting aside the defendant\u2019s verdicts and granting the defendant a new trial is vacated and the jury\u2019s verdicts of murder in the first degree and rape are reinstated. Sentence is to be imposed in the Superior Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b840-8\">There are different methods used in DNA forensic testing, including RFLP and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification and allele identification.

As the judge noted in his March, 1995, order denying the Commonwealth\u2019s motion for reconsideration, \u201cthe only part of the DNA evidence challenged by the defendant under the <em>Frye-Cumin </em>standard, was the statistical procedure, known as the \u2018ceiling\u2019 method, used to calculate the significance of a laboratory match of DNA profiles.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b843-8\">Mueller testified that the 1992 NRC Report contained three permanent recommendations: (1) that all forensic laboratories base their statistical analyses on a collection of fifteen to twenty ethnic subgroup database populations rather than use three or four different racial categories; (2) that the product rule be replaced by the ceiling principle for calculating the probability of a DNA match in the general population; and (3) that laboratories report to juries the false positive rate in order to indicate the probability that the laboratory might incorrectly match DNA samples.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-9\">Mueller further testified that the 1992 NRC Report had recognized that it would take some time for laboratories to collect samples for the fifteen to twenty ethnic subgroup database populations, and had therefore made two \u201cinterim\u201d recommendations for laboratories to follow while they assembled the ethnic subgroup database populations. These interim recommendations, Mueller said, are (1) that laboratories use a \u201ccounting method,\u201d by which the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"824\">*824</page-number>DNA profile obtained from the evidence sample be compared to every person in the laboratory\u2019s database to see whether there is any match, and (2) that the laboratories perform a \u201cmodified\u201d ceiling principle, using at least three databases.

The product rule has validity as well in the context of the RFLP method of analysis used in this case. The 1996 NRC Report recognizes that the ceiling principle, developed in response to concerns about the possibility of genetic subpopulations, was of particular significance in calculating VNTR profile frequencies, such as the profile frequencies in this case. See note 1, <em>supra. </em>The 1996 NRC Report\u2019s conclusion, <em>supra </em>at 158, that the ceiling principle and interim ceiling principle were \u201cexcessively conservative,\u201d and its conclusion that the product rule should be used in making profile frequencies is applicable to VNTR-based systems, such as the RFLP. <em>Id. </em>at 5.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b847-7\">In anticipation that some laboratories might still use the ceiling principle analysis, the 1996 NRC Report made recommendations \u201cthat will make the [ceiling] principle more workable and less susceptible to creative misapplications.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b847-8\">A 1993 report produced by the FBI, entitled VNTR Population Data: A Worldwide Study, arrived at a similar conclusion that the product rule was valid and that the data do not support the need for alternative procedures, such as the ceiling principle. See <em>Rosier, supra </em>at 815 n.16.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b848-6\">The judge identified four \u201cfailings\u201d of the FBI in its analysis using the interim ceiling principle, none of which withstands scrutiny in light of the 1996 NRC Report. The judge found that \u201cthe FBI did not apply the counting method statistical calculation and instead used a corrective mathematical ceiling approach for which there was no support in the relevant scientific community.\" The 1996 NRC Report discredits any requirement that the \u201ccounting method\u201d be used. <em>Id. </em>at 159-160. Second, the judge said \u201cthe FBI failed to use all of the databases at its disposal.\u201d The 1996 NRC Report validates the use by the FBI of the population groups in this case. Third, the judge concluded that, \u201calthough the NRC did not recommend that a laboratory\u2019s error rate in conducting an interim ceiling calculation should be told to the jury, as the NRC stated should be done for a standard ceiling test, Dr. Mueller stated that such an error-rate report should also be made to the jury for any interim ceiling tests.\u201d The 1996 NRC Report, at 185, explicitly declined to make such a recommendation, commenting that \u201c[ijnasmuch as the purpose of our report is to determine what aspects of the procedures used in connection with forensic DNA testing are scientifically valid, we attempt no such <em>policy </em>judgment\u201d (emphasis supplied). Finally, the judge noted that \u201calthough the FBI used the \u2018fixed-bin\u2019 method instead of the \u2018floating-bin method\u2019 as recommended by the NRC, this is not fatal to the FBI\u2019s calculation because the NRC also stated that fixed-bin method was \u2018acceptable\u2019 for purposes of the interim ceiling approach.\u201d This is consistent with the 1996 NRC Report at 162.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b848-7\">The lack of prejudicial error resulting from admitting the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence of the DNA profile frequency is further evidenced by the limited range of men who could have been the source of the semen found in the victim\u2019s mouth. It is undisputed that the victim, a two year old child, had contact with few people (all identified) in the days immediately preceding her death. The Commonwealth accounted for the last days of the victim\u2019s life, and tested the DNA of the only four males who had contact with the victim in the days immediately preceding her death: the defendant; the victim\u2019s father; a friend of the father; and the victim\u2019s maternal grandfather. The Commonwealth\u2019s expert testified that all but the defendant were eliminated as the source of the semen found in the victim\u2019s mouth.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b849-8\">As Mertens testified, the FBI studies indicated that genetic subpopulations did not exist and therefore the ceiling principle analysis was not needed. But to the extent there was any doubt about that, the ceiling principle eliminated any effect that the subpopulations might have and added \u201cfurther level of conservativeness to an already conservative system\u201d to the statistical analyses using the product rule. The defendant\u2019s expert agreed.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
