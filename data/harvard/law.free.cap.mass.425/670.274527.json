Gillette sought to have the Commissioner of Revenue (commissioner) recompute its corporate excise tax using the so-called \u201cunitary method\u201d of net income determination and apportionment. Relying on <em>Polaroid Corp. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Revenue, </em>393 Mass. 490 (1984), the board ruled that there was no statutory authority for using the unitary method. On appeal, Gillette claims that the board erred in ruling (1) that the unitary method was not authorized under G. L. c. 63, \u00a7 42; and (2) that requiring unitary businesses to use the \u201cstatutory method\u201d did not violate the due process and commerce clauses of the United States Constitution. We granted Gillette\u2019s application for direct appellate review, and now affirm the board\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-5\">1. a. <em>Facts. </em>The following stipulated facts were adopted by the board. Gillette is a Delaware corporation with its principal offices in Boston. Throughout the years at issue, Gillette engaged in worldwide unitary business with domestic (United States) and foreign (non-United States) affiliates.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> At all relevant times, Gillette transacted business partly within and without Massachusetts.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-6\">Gillette engaged in business outside the United States through foreign subsidiary corporations. These subsidiaries did not conduct business in Massachusetts, but they did make interest and royalty payments to Gillette. These payments were income to Gillette and thus subject to tax in the local countries pursuant to foreign tax statutes, as modified by treaties negotiated with the United States. The subsidiaries withheld the tax owed by Gillette and paid it directly to the foreign government. Gillette also received royalty income from unrelated foreign manufacturers for the right to use its patents.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-7\">From 1975 to 1979, Gillette filed a combined return under G. L. c. 63, \u00a7 32B, with those United States affiliates which had a nexus with Massachusetts and participated in its Federal consolidated tax returns.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> For tax year 1980, Gillette initially filed a combined return, but prior to a final assessment, amended <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"672\">*672</page-number>the 1980 return using the unitary method. Gillette also filed amended returns for the tax years 1975 through 1977 using the unitary method and filed applications for abatement for tax years 1978 through 1979. For tax years 1981 through 1983, Gillette used the unitary method in preparing its initial returns. In short, Gillette sought to have its corporate excise tax liability for 1975 through 1983 assessed under the unitary method.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-5\">Gillette\u2019s actions were apparently prompted by the commissioner\u2019s moves to compel unitary businesses to employ the unitary method. Beginning in the late 1970\u2019s, the commissioner selectively assessed taxpayers under the unitary method. In the early 1980\u2019s, the commissioner formalized this approach through use of unitary business questionnaires, and finally, in 1984, the commissioner promulgated the corporate excise regulations, 830 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 63.02 (1984) (unitary business regulations). These regulations required unitary businesses to file a report of combined income of the unitary business group, and determine its taxable net income by reference to the combined group.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b692-6\">In December, 1984, this court in <em>Polaroid Corp. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Revenue, supra, </em>held that the commissioner lacked the statutory authority to use the unitary method. In January, 1985, the commissioner repealed the unitary business regulations.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b692-7\">On appeal to the board, Gillette maintained that the promulgation of the unitary business regulations was based on the commissioner\u2019s determination that the statutory method provided in G. L. c. 63, \u00a7 38, was inadequate when applied to a unitary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"673\">*673</page-number>business. Furthermore, Gillette contended that the commissioner misinterpreted our holding in <em>Polaroid Corp., supra, </em>when he repealed the unitary business regulations. Gillette argued that the <em>Polaroid Corp. </em>case only limited the commissioner\u2019s authority to impose the unitary method, but did not limit a taxpayer\u2019s right to apply to use the unitary method under G. L. c. 63, \u00a7 42.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-5\">b. <em>Corporate excise tax structure. </em>Massachusetts utilizes the so-called \u201cstatutory method\u201d embodied in G. L. c. 63, \u00a7 38, to calculate the portion of a unitary business\u2019s net income (taxable net income) subject to our State corporate excise tax. Taxable net income is determined by taking the corporation\u2019s Federal net income, as defined in G. L. c. 63, \u00a7 30 (5) (6), applying statutory deductions enumerated in G. L. c. 63, \u00a7 38 (a), and multiplying the result by the three-factor apportionment formula in G. L. c. 63, \u00a7 38 (c). The apportionment formula is the weighted average of three factors \u2014 property, payroll, and sales \u2014 commonly used to compare the value of business conducted within and without the State.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Each factor is a fraction in itself, the numerator of which is the local corporate property, payroll, or sales; the denominator of which is the corporation\u2019s total property, payroll, or sales \u201ceverywhere\u201d during the taxable year.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-6\">If two or more affiliated corporations have a nexus with Massachusetts and file a consolidated return for Federal tax purposes, they may elect to use their combined net income as the base income subject to apportionment. G. L. c. 63, \u00a7 32B. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"674\">*674</page-number>When a corporation files a combined return, property, payroll, and sales of all the affiliated corporations are included in the denominator of the apportionment factors. Finally, if the allocation and apportionment provisions of G. L. c. 63, \u00a7 38, are not reasonably adapted to approximate the net income derived from business carried on within this State, G. L. c. 63, \u00a7 42, provides that the taxpayer may petition the commissioner to use a \u201cmethod other than that set out\u201d in \u00a7 38.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-5\">The unitary and statutory methods differ in how they account for foreign subsidiaries in the net income base and apportionment formula. The unitary method combines net income from all businesses in the unitary group, makes adjustments as necessary, and then apportions the income to the local jurisdiction using the unitary group\u2019s factors in the apportionment formula. There are two significant consequences. First, the unitary method\u2019s net income base includes income from foreign subsidiaries, thus increasing combined net income and eliminating intercompany transactions, such as interest and royalty payments. Second, all members in the unitary group are included in the statutory apportionment formula. This means that the property, payroll, and sales from foreign corporations are included in the denominator of the apportionment factors, thus decreasing the percent of combined net income apportioned to a State. With this background in mind, we now consider whether there is statutory authority for using the unitary method.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-6\">2. <em>Discussion. </em>There is no doubt that the unitary method is permissible under the Constitution of the United States. See, e.g., <em>Container Corp. of Am. </em>v. <em>Franchise Tax Bd., </em>463 U.S. 159 (1983). However, constitutional approval does not mean that taxpayers and taxing authorities are free to employ the unitary method when it suits their respective tax planning and assessment objectives. \u201c[T]he State has no power to tax unless that power has been expressly conferred by statute.\u201d <em>Commissioner of Revenue </em>v. <em>Franchi, </em>423 Mass. 817, 822 (1996). \u201cThe general rule of construction is that where the language of the statute is plain, it must be interpreted in accordance with the usual and natural meaning of the words. <em>O\u2019Sullivan </em>v. <em>Secretary of Human Servs., </em>402 Mass. 190, 194 (1988). This rule has particular force in interpreting tax statutes.\u201d <em>Commissioner of Revenue </em>v. <em>AMIWoodbroke, Inc., </em>418 Mass. 92, 94 (1994). In addition, \u201cwords of a statute must be construed in association with other statutory language and the general statutory plan.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"675\">*675</page-number><em>Polaroid Corp. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Revenue, </em>393 Mass. 490, 497 (1984). No method of determining tax liability is valid unless authorized by statute and assessed in conformity to its terms. See <em>Commissioner of Revenue </em>v. <em>AMIWoodbroke, Inc., supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b695-5\">In <em>Polaroid Corp. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Revenue, supra, </em>we were asked to decide whether the commissioner had the statutory authority to employ the unitary method in determining a corporation\u2019s taxable net income. After holding that the commissioner could not lawfully use the unitary method without first adopting appropriate regulations, <em>id. </em>at 496, we declared that G. L. c. 63, \u00a7\u00a7 39A and 42, did not grant the commissioner the authority to impose the unitary method. <em>Id. </em>at 500. At the same time, we observed in dictum that \u201c\u00a7 42 itself seems not to authorize a unitary approach of the type adopted by the commissioner in this case to determine taxable net income even of a corporation seeking relief under \u00a7 42.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 501. We see no reason to disturb this conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-6\">\u201c[A] statutory pattern that determines taxable income by starting with Federal gross income casts doubt on the propriety of the adoption of a worldwide unitary approach in determining taxable net income.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 498 n.10. Massachusetts corporate excise statutes use consolidated Federal net income as the basis for calculating combined net income. See G. L. c. 63, \u00a7\u00a7 30, 32B, 38. Pursuant to \u00a7 1504 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (I.R.C.), consolidated Federal net income excludes income from foreign subsidiaries. Because the unitary method includes foreign affiliates\u2019 income, it may only be used if G. L. c. 63, \u00a7 42, provides an exception to the net income provisions found in \u00a7\u00a7 30, 32B, and 38.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-7\">There is no indication that the Legislature intended G. L. c. 63, \u00a7 42, to provide an alternative method of calculating combined net income. \u201c[Section] 42 appears to have nothing to do with determining a corporation\u2019s taxable net income but only concerns the formula used to apportion that income.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 501. The relevant provision of \u00a7 42 reads, in pertinent part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b695-8\">\u201cIf the allocation and apportionment provisions of this chapter are not reasonably adapted to approximate the net income derived from business carried on within this commonwealth, a corporation may apply to the commissioner <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"676\">*676</page-number>to have its income derived from business carried on within this commonwealth determined by a method other than that set forth in section thirty-eight....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b696-5\">\u201cIf, in the judgment of the commissioner the allocation and apportionment provisions of this chapter are not reasonably adapted to approximate the corporation\u2019s net income derived from business carried on within this commonwealth, the commissioner shall by reasonable methods determine the amount of net income derived from business activity carried on within this commonwealth. The amount thus determined shall be the net income taxable under this chapter and the foregoing determination shall be in lieu of the determination required by section thirty-eight. . . .\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b696-6\">The plain meaning of \u201callocation and apportionment\u201d in this context is the assignment or distribution of business income of a multistate corporation to a specific State. See Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 75, 100 (6th ed. 1990). This meaning is consistent with a statute which authorizes an alternative method to determine the proportion of \u201cnet income derived from business carried on within this commonwealth.\u201d Indeed, past appeals under \u00a7 42 involved attempts by corporations to require the commissioner to use alternative apportionment methods. See <em>Becton, Dickinson &amp; Co. </em>v. <em>Department of Revenue, </em>383 Mass. 786, 790 (1981); <em>W.R. Grace &amp; Co. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Revenue, </em>378 Mass. 577, 591 (1979); <em>Dow Chem. Co. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Revenue, </em>378 Mass. 254, 260 (1979). Section 42 has never been interpreted by this court as authority for using an alternative method of determining net income. Thus, we believe that the scope of \u00a7 42 is limited to allowing taxpayers to request an apportionment formula other than that set forth in \u00a7 38 <em>(c).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b696-7\">This conclusion is bolstered by the legislative history of the statute. General Laws c. 63, \u00a7 42, was inserted by St. 1919, c. 355, \u00a7 20, as part of a larger statutory scheme to tax corporate excise and net income. Section 42 provided foreign corporations with an alternative method for \u201cshowing the amount of [their] annual net income derived from business carried on within the commonwealth.\u201d The statute was rewritten, St. 1933, c. 342, \u00a7 5, to clarify the timing for requesting an alternative allocation method and the commissioner\u2019s discretion when such a request <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"677\">*677</page-number>is made. In 1966, \u00a7 42 was substantially rewritten. St. 1966, c. 698, \u00a7 64. The revised statute eliminated references to foreign corporations and thus provided domestic corporations with a means of challenging the \u201callocation and apportionment\u201d of income in G. L. c. 63, \u00a7 38. As one commentary at the time noted, \u201cG. L. c. 63, \u00a7 42 has been amended by Section 64 of Chapter 698 of the Acts of 1966 to extend to domestic corporations the privilege of having their taxable income determined by some method other than that prescribed by G. L. c. 63, \u00a7 38 (c) if the formula in that latter section is \u2018not reasonably adapted to approximate the net income derived from business carried on within this commonwealth.\u2019 \u201d Dane, Taxation of Corporations and Banks: 1966 Legislation, 52 Mass. L.Q. 42, 62-63 (1967). The legislative history indicates that \u00a7 42 only applied to the apportionment of income, not the determination of that income.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-5\">This interpretation is consistent with the prevailing view on the constitutionality of the unitary method when the 1933 and 1966 amendments were written. \u201cThe Legislature must be assumed to know the preexisting law and the decisions of this court.\u201d <em>Selectmen of Topsfield </em>v. <em>State Racing </em>Comm\u2019n, 324 Mass. 309, 313 (1949). The 1933 amendment came one year after this court, in <em>Commissioner of Corps. &amp; Taxation </em>v. <em>J.G. McCrory Co., </em>280 Mass. 273, 279-280 (1932), concluded that the unitary approach of the type the commissioner wanted to apply was unconstitutional. See <em>Polaroid Corp. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Revenue, </em>393 Mass. 490, 499-500 (1984) (Legislature did not grant authority for unitary method in 1933 amendment to G. L. c. 63, \u00a7 39A, where practice then thought constitutionally impermissible). Indeed, the unitary method was not widely accepted until the Supreme Court in <em>Container Corp. of Am. </em>v. <em>Franchise Tax Bd., </em>463 U.S. 159 (1983), endorsed California\u2019s use of the unitary method. Prior to <em>Container Corp., supra, </em>the prevailing view in this State was that the unitary method was unconstitutional. See <em>Commissioner of Corps. &amp; Taxation </em>v. <em>J.G. McCrory Co., supra </em>at 279. Thus, we find it unlikely that the Legislature intended \u00a7 42 to authorize the unitary method.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-6\">We conclude that \u00a7 42 does not grant statutory authority for the unitary method. Without such statutory authority, the unitary method is not a permissible method of computing taxable net income. Therefore, it must follow that Gillette was not entitled to use the unitary method for the years in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-7\">Gillette contends that the unitary business regulations formal<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"678\">*678</page-number>ized the commissioner\u2019s determination that the statutory method was not reasonably adapted to worldwide unitary businesses. Gillette argues that the commissioner may not retroactively revoke that prior determination. Consequently, Gillette argues that the commissioner is required to employ the unitary method in this case. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-5\">\u201cAn administrative agency has .no inherent or common law authority to do anything.\u201d <em>Commissioner of Revenue </em>v. <em>Marr Scaffolding Co., </em>414 Mass. 489, 493 (1993). The commissioner\u2019s authority to assess taxes is derived from either express or implied statutory authority. See <em>id.; Polaroid Corp. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Revenue, supra </em>at 500. At times, the commissioner has been mistaken in the interpretation of this authority. For this reason, the judiciary has the power to review the commissioner\u2019s actions to ensure that the authority delegated is used in accordance with the standards and policies adopted by the Legislature. See <em>Risk Mgt. Found. of the Harvard Medical Inst., Inc. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Ins., </em>407 Mass. 498, 506 (1990), quoting <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>393 Mass. 1209, 1220 (1984). Indeed, \u201c[t]he commissioner\u2019s expertise in tax matters might even bring the commissioner to the conclusion that a prior interpretation of a statute or regulation was wrong and should be changed.\u201d <em>Commissioner of Revenue </em>v. <em>BayBank Middlesex, </em>421 Mass. 736, 741-742 (1996). When a prior determination has been proved wrong, a taxpayer\u2019s reliance on the error will not prevent the commissioner from correcting a mistake of law and assessing a tax that is otherwise lawfully due. See <em>Commissioner of Revenue </em>v. <em>Marr Scaffolding Co., supra </em>at 494-495; <em>John S. Lane &amp; Son </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Revenue, 396 </em>Mass. 137, 141-142 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b698-6\">In <em>Commissioner of Revenue </em>v. <em>BayBank Middlesex, supra, </em>the taxpayer challenged the commissioner\u2019s change in stance with regard to the deductibility of tax-exempt premiums. We held that the commissioner could not retroactively assess back taxes and interest where the Department of Revenue had stated a clear policy on the issue that had remained unchanged and on which the taxpayers relied. <em>Id. </em>at 740-741. We specifically stated that this case was readily distinguishable from our cases holding that taxpayers have no right to claim estoppel and allowing the commissioner to correct \u201cmistakes of law\u201d based on a new interpretation of the revenue statutes. <em>Id. </em>at 740.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-7\">This is not a case where the commissioner is trying <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"679\">*679</page-number>retroactively to change a clear policy on an issue that had remained unchanged and on which the taxpayers had relied. See <em>Commissioner of Revenue </em>v. <em>BayBank Middlesex, supra </em>at 739-743. Prior to 1984, it was uncertain whether the commissioner had the authority to employ the unitary method.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In December, 1984, we concluded in <em>Polaroid Corp. </em>that the commissioner lacked the statutory authority to use the unitary approach. One month later, the commissioner repealed the unitary business regulations. The commissioner then granted abatements to taxpayers who were previously taxed in accordance with the unitary approach and denied pending and future applications seeking to employ this method. The commissioner was not estopped from concluding that a prior interpretation of \u00a7 42 was wrong, particularly when that conclusion is based on a decision of this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-5\">Furthermore, the relief available under \u00a7 42 is only available on a case-by-case basis. See <em>Polaroid Corp. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Revenue, supra </em>at 500; <em>W.R. Grace &amp; Co. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Revenue, </em>378 Mass. 577, 590-591 (1979). \u201cThe commissioner\u2019s authority to use an alternative allocation approach applies only to \u2018the corporation\u2019 which has applied for relief under \u00a7 42.\u201d <em>Polaroid Corp. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Revenue, supra </em>at 501. \u201cBefore we will require the [cjommissioner to adopt an alternative computation method, the taxpayer must prove by \u2018clear and cogent evidence\u2019 that the income attributed to the Commonwealth is in fact \u2018out of all appropriate proportion to the business transacted\u2019 here or has led to a grossly distorted result.\u2019 \u201d <em>W.R. Grace &amp; Co. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Revenue, supra </em>at 591, quoting <em>Moorman Mfg. Co. </em>v. <em>Bair, </em>437 U.S. 267, 274 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b699-6\">The board ruled that Gillette failed to prove by \u201cclear and cogent evidence\u201d that the income attributed to the Commonwealth under the statutory apportionment formula was out of appropriate proportion to the business transacted here. On appeal, Gillette relies solely on the commissioner\u2019s promulgation of regulations (which were subsequently repealed) as proof that the statutory method was inadequate. A blanket assertion that the statutory method is not suitable for all unitary businesses is not sufficient to warrant relief under \u00a7 42. See <em>Container Corp. of Am. </em>v. <em>Franchise Tax Bd., supra </em>at 182.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"680\">*680</page-number>3. a. <em>Due process clause. </em>Gillette maintains that the statutory method\u2019s apportionment formula violates the due process clause of the United States Constitution.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Gillette argues that the inclusion of interest and royalty payments from foreign subsidiaries in its net income base, without a corresponding inclusion of the property, payroll, and sales of the subsidiaries in its apportionment formula, is unfair, and led to a result out of appropriate proportion to the business transacted in Massachusetts. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-5\">A State\u2019s apportionment formula need not allocate income with precision, see <em>Mobil Oil Corp. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Taxes of Vt., </em>445 U.S. 425, 438 (1980); it must only be \u201cfair.\u201d <em>Container Corp. of Am. </em>v. <em>Franchise Tax Bd., supra </em>at 169. See <em>Exxon Corp. </em>v. <em>Department of Revenue of Wisc., </em>447 U.S. 207, 219 (1980); <em>W.R. Grace &amp; Co. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Revenue, supra </em>at 588-589 n.11. \u201cThe first, and again obvious, component of fairness in an apportionment formula is what might be called internal consistency \u2014 that is, the formula must be such that, if applied by every jurisdiction, it would result in no more than all of the unitary business\u2019 income being taxed. The second and more difficult requirement is what might be called external consistency \u2014 the factor or factors used in the apportionment formula must actually reflect a reasonable sense of how income is generated.\u201d <em>Container Corp. of Am. </em>v. <em>Franchise Tax Bd., supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b700-6\">The Supreme Court has \u201clong held that the Constitution imposes no single [apportionment] formula on the States . . . and that the taxpayer has the \u2018distinct burden of showing by \u201cclear and cogent evidence\u201d that [the State tax] results in extraterritorial values being taxed\u2019 \u201d (citation omitted). <em>Container Corp of Am. </em>v. <em>Franchise Tax Bd., supra </em>at 164, quoting <em>Exxon Corp. </em>v. <em>Department of Revenue of Wisc., supra </em>at 221. We are required to strike down an apportionment formula only when the taxpayer has established by clear and cogent evidence that the apportioned income is out of all appropriate proportion to the business the taxpayer transacts in the State. <em>Container Corp. of Am. </em>v. <em>Franchise Tax Bd., supra </em>at 170, 180-181. We are not required to disturb an apportionment formula so long as the State, in applying the formula to a unitary business taxpayer\u2019s total income, obtains a \u201c \u2018rough approxima<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"681\">*681</page-number>tion\u2019 of the corporate income that is \u2018reasonably related to the activities conducted within the taxing State.\u2019 \u201d <em>Exxon Corp. </em>v. <em>Department of Revenue of Wisc., supra </em>at 223, quoting <em>Moor-man Mfg. Co. </em>v. <em>Bair, supra </em>at 273.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-5\">The three-factor formula adopted by the Legislature in G. L. c. 63, \u00a7 38 (c), is widely recognized as a fair method of apportioning net income. See <em>Becton, Dickinson &amp; Co. </em>v. <em>Department of Revenue, </em>383 Mass. 786, 790 (1981) (unsuccessful attempt to require commissioner to use alternative apportionment method); <em>W.R. Grace &amp; Co. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Revenue, supra </em>at 587-588 (same). \u201cIndeed, not only has the three-factor formula met our approval, but it has become . . . something of a benchmark against which other apportionment formulas are judged.\u201d <em>Container Corp. of Am. </em>v. <em>Franchise Tax Bd., supra </em>at 170.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-6\">Gillette wants its foreign subsidiaries\u2019 property, payroll, and sales included in the apportionment formula because interest and royalty payments received from the subsidiaries were included in the apportionable income.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> This argument ignores the fact that these payments represent income earned by Gillette, not its subsidiaries. From the foreign subsidiaries\u2019 perspective, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"682\">*682</page-number>royalty and interest payments were expenses. As the board stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b702-5\">\u201cWhile it may be that, when a subsidiary\u2019s income is combined with the parent\u2019s income subject to apportionment, a taxing state must also combine the property, payroll, and sales figures of all members of a unitary business to calculate an apportionment formula, it does not follow that a combined apportionment formula is required when only the parent corporation\u2019s income is being taxed.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b702-6\">Because no foreign subsidiary income is included in the net income base, we see no reason to include these subsidiaries\u2019 property, payroll, and sales in the denominator of the apportionment factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-7\">In States with similar apportionment statutes, the courts have held that it is not unconstitutional to include interest and royalty income from foreign subsidiaries without including the subsidiaries\u2019 property, payroll, and sales in the apportionment factors. See <em>National Cash Register Corp. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Revenue, </em>438 N.W.2d 86, 92-93 (Minn.), cert, denied, 493 U.S. 848 (1989); <em>National Cash Register Corp. </em>v. <em>Comptroller, </em>313 Md. 118, 153-154 (1988). The fact that these were subsidiary corporations does not change the nature of the underlying transaction. It is no more appropriate to include the property, payroll, and sales of these subsidiaries in the apportionment formula than it would be to include the corresponding amounts of the unrelated manufacturers who make royalty payments to Gillette. Thus, Gillette has failed to show by clear and cogent evidence that failure to include foreign subsidiaries\u2019 property, payroll, and sales in the apportionment formula was not fair or out of all proportion to income earned in Massachusetts.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b702-8\">b. <em>Commerce clause. </em>\u201cBesides being fair, an apportionment formula must, under the Commerce Clause, also not result in discrimination against interstate or foreign commerce.\u201d <em>Container Corp. of Am. </em>v. <em>Franchise Tax Bd,., supra </em>at 170. In the interstate context, the antidiscrimination principle has not in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"683\">*683</page-number>practice required much in addition to the due process fairness requirement. <em>Id. </em>at 171. In the foreign context, careful attention must be paid to avoid double taxation of foreign source income and impermissible interference with Federal uniformity of foreign tax policy. See <em>id.; Mobil Oil Corp. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Taxes of Vt., supra </em>at 446; <em>Japan Line, Ltd. </em>v. <em>County of Los Angeles, </em>441 U.S. 434, 446-447 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b703-5\">Gillette contends that the statutory method inevitably leads to multiple taxation because income derived from foreign subsidiaries is included in taxable net income. For the reasons stated in Part 3. a., <em>infra, </em>this argument must fail. We need only reiterate that the interest and royalty payments represent income earned by Gillette in arm\u2019s-length transactions. These payments were expenses, not income, for the foreign subsidiaries. Thus, there was no double taxation of foreign subsidiary income.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-6\">While it is true that Gillette itself was subject to tax on royalty and interest income in foreign countries, it has failed to demonstrate that double taxation in fact exists. \u201c[Speculative concerns with multiple taxation provide insufficient basis for invalidating a tax derived from a reasonable apportionment formula reasonably applied.\u201d <em>W.R. Grace &amp; Co. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Revenue, supra </em>at 589. The record indicates that Gillette did not pay taxes on this income in many foreign countries, including Belgium, Denmark, England, Germany, Indonesia, Norway, Netherlands, and Spain. Cf. <em>Container Corp. of Am. </em>v. <em>Franchise Tax Bd., supra </em>at 189-193 (double taxation on foreign source income not impermissible where not inevitable and no reasonable alternative); <em>Japan Line, Ltd. </em>v. <em>County of Los Angeles, supra </em>at 445-447 (double taxation on foreign property impermissible where ad valorem property tax scheme makes it inevitable).</p>\n<p id=\"b703-7\">Moreover, there is no absolute prohibition on State-induced double taxation in the international context. <em>Container Corp. of Am. </em>v. <em>Franchise Tax Bd., supra </em>at 189. \u201cAlthough double taxation in the foreign commerce context deserves to receive close scrutiny, that scrutiny must take into account the context in which the double taxation takes place and the alternatives reasonably available to the taxing State.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The royalty and interest income from foreign subsidiaries would still be subject to double taxation under the unitary method. As the Supreme Court stated, \u201cit would be perverse, simply for the sake of avoiding double taxation, to require [a State] to give up one alloca<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"684\">*684</page-number>tion method that sometimes results in double taxation in favor of another allocation method that also sometimes results in double taxation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 193. We conclude that Gillette has failed to show \u201cclear and cogent evidence\u201d that the statutory method violated the commerce clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-5\">c. <em>Prior version of G. L. c. 63, \u00a7 32B. </em>Finally, we decline to consider Gillette\u2019s argument that the prior version of G. L. c. 63, \u00a7 32B, which was in effect for the tax years at issue, facially discriminated against foreign commerce. \u201cAn issue of law not presented to the board may not be raised here for the first time.\u201d <em>Shea </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Revenue, </em>390 Mass. 1001, 1001 (1983), citing <em>Roda Realty Trust </em>v. <em>Assessors of Belmont, </em>385 Mass. 493, 495 (1982).

In <em>Mobil Oil Corp., </em>Vermont included Mobil Oil\u2019s foreign subsidiaries dividend income in its apportionable income bases. But in its three-factor formula, it failed to include the property, payroll, and sales factors responsible for producing the foreign subsidiary income. For reasons that are not important here, the majority declined to decide \u201cwhether application of Vermont\u2019s formula produced a fair attribution of [Mobil Oil\u2019s] dividend income to that State.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 434. Justice Stevens, however, did reach the issue in a dissent. He stated: \u201cUnless the sales, payroll, and property values connected with the production of income by the payor corporation are added to the denominator of the apportionment formula, the inclusion of earnings attributable to those corporations in the apportionable tax base will inevitably cause Mobil Vermont\u2019s income to be overstated.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 461 (Stevens, J., dissenting).
