L. c. 25, \u00a7 5, from an order of the Department of Public Utilities (department) that authorizes the Cambridge Electric Light Company (company) to impose a monthly customer transition charge (CTC) on MIT, following MIT\u2019s construction of its own cogeneration facility and its departure as a full-service customer from the company.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The single justice reserved and reported the case to the full court.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b877-9\">The CTC was authorized by the department to permit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"858\">*858</page-number>recovery of the company\u2019s so-called \u201cstranded costs\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> from MIT because of MIT\u2019s size in relation to the company, and its decision to self-generate.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> According to MIT, the CTC authorized by the department in this case is the first such tariff imposed on a cogeneration facility anywhere in the country; the CTC would require MIT to pay an additional monthly charge exceeding $110,000, resulting in an annual charge of $1.3 million to MIT.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b878-5\">On appeal, MIT argues that in approving the CTC, the department failed to apply its own PURPA regulations, 220 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7\u00a7 8.00-8.07 (1993). MIT next claims that the department failed to make the necessary subsidiary findings in support of its calculation of the stranded costs that formed the basis of the CTC. Third, MIT asserts that the department\u2019s allocation of 75% of the company\u2019s stranded costs allegedly attributable to MIT is arbitrary and capricious. Finally, MIT argues that this court must reverse the department\u2019s order because imposing the CTC on MIT results in the inequitable retroactive application of new decisional law.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-6\">We conclude that, contrary to the claim of MIT, the imposition of a customer transition charge, as such, does not violate State PURPA regulations, 220 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7\u00a7 8.00-8.07. However, because the department\u2019s subsidiary findings, see <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"859\">*859</page-number>G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 11 (8),<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> are insufficient for us to give any meaningful review to the calculation of the stranded costs that formed the basis of the CTC, and are similarly insufficient for us to determine whether its decision to permit the company to recover 75% of the costs attributable to MIT is arbitrary, we decline to affirm the department\u2019s order, and remand for further proceedings. See G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14 (7). We are also unable to conclude on the basis of the department\u2019s inadequate decision whether the imposition of the approved CTC on MIT violates principles prohibiting the inequitable retroactive application of new decisional law.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b879-6\">In 1985, MIT began investigating the option of constructing its own electricity-generating, cogeneration facility.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> In an attempt to keep MIT as a customer of the company, in 1992 the company proposed several options to MIT, including a buy-sell agreement, discounted rates, cogeneration deferral payments, and other potential ratemaking concessions.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> After MIT and the company failed to reach any agreement with respect to MIT remaining as an all-requirements customer, MIT began construction of its multimillion dollar, twenty-megawatt cogeneration facility in 1993.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Operations commenced on September 16, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"860\">*860</page-number>1995. The cogeneration facility satisfied all of the criteria for, and was designated, a qualifying cogeneration facility (qualifying facility or QF) under the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978 (PURPA), 16 U.S.C. \u00a7 824-824k (1994).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Although MIT\u2019s cogeneration facility can generate enough power to meet MIT\u2019s normal electricity requirements, MIT still must purchase auxiliary services from the company to meet its needs when the facility experiences an outage, and to cover peak periods of usage.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b880-5\">In May, 1994, prior to the completion of the construction of its facility, MIT filed a petition with the department to establish \u201cjust and reasonable\u201d rates for three types of auxiliary services MIT would require from the company after completion of its cogeneration facility: standby service, maintenance service, and supplemental service.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> In response, on March 15, 1995, the company filed for approval its proposed rates for these services; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"861\">*861</page-number>it also proposed an additional monthly customer transition charge (CTC) of $7.49 per kilovolt amperes (kVa) to be assessed on all applicable<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> customers on a monthly basis. The department consolidated MIT\u2019s request and the company\u2019s proposed CTC and its proposed auxiliary rates into a single case, D.P.U. 94-101/95-36.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-5\">The CTC proposed by the company was intended to recover what it claimed were the stranded costs that would result from MIT\u2019s departure as a major customer of the company.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> The company claimed that, absent approval of the CTC, there was a likelihood of substantial cost shifting to residential and other small customers because of the loss of a customer the size of MIT relative to the company\u2019s system. Although the CTC for which the company sought approval was designed to apply to any of its departing customers with demands above a specific level, to date MIT is the only customer to which the CTC is applicable; the remaining applicable customers have not indicated that they would or might depart as customers of the company.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-6\">In the proceedings before the department, the company explained the basis on which it had calculated the monthly CTC charge for which it sought authorization. It began by defining a load at-risk class, the class of customers whose departure from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"862\">*862</page-number>its system the company claimed would result in a significant loss of revenue to it. (The company determined that this class consisted of seven customers with an average monthly demand level of 2,000 kVa or greater.)<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Next, the company calculated the total net stranded cost that it claimed it would incur if every member of the load at-risk class were to depart as a full-service customer from the company. To calculate this cost, it first calculated the gross annual revenue associated with the class (nearly $21 million).<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> From this amount the company subtracted an amount equal to the \u201cavoidable variable expenses\u201d that would not be incurred if all of the load at-risk customers left the system (almost $6 million). The company claimed that this resulted in an annual revenue requirement figure of approximately $15 million.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-5\">Next, the company mitigated what it claimed was the \u201cgross amount of stranded costs\u201d for the load at-risk class by the amount of (1) expected revenues from continued services provided to the customers should they depart (approximately $ 4.5 million); (2) potential revenues from reselling the generating capacity available to be marketed as a result of the custom<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"863\">*863</page-number>ers\u2019 departure (approximately $3 million); and (3) the revenues associated with anticipated load growth on the company\u2019s system (approximately $1.6 million). Subtracting these mitigating factors, the company claimed \u201cnet stranded cost\u201d of approximately $6 million. The company then divided the net stranded cost amount by the 66,806,000 kVa purchased annually by the entire load at-risk class of seven customers, and then divided the resulting amount by twelve to arrive at a monthly charge of $7.49 kVa. It sought authorization from the department to impose this monthly CTC charge on MIT.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-5\">Regarding the CTC proposed by the company, MIT filed a motion to dismiss or for partial summary judgment, which was denied.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> MIT also challenged the calculation of the CTC proposed by the company on several grounds: that the CTC was premature, was based on incorrect assumptions concerning the company\u2019s capacity and costs, was based on incorrect calculations, was premised on faulty economics, was applied incorrectly to certain types of customers, and was contrary to established policy. The Attorney General, intervening as of right pursuant to G. L. c. 12, \u00a7 11E, also challenged the CTC proposed by the company. Contrary to MIT\u2019s position, he argued that the department has authority under G. L. c. 164, \u00a7 94, to approve a CTC tariff. Nevertheless, he urged the department to reject the company\u2019s proposed CTC because, as the department later described his position, \u201cthe company had been on notice since at least 1985 that MIT was actively considering self-generation and that the Company did not undertake any meaningful effort to mitigate the foreseeable consequences of losing MIT as a full requirements customer.\u201d According to the Attorney General, the company had failed to demonstrate that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"864\">*864</page-number>the costs for which it sought reimbursement through the CTC were prudently incurred.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b884-5\">The city of Cambridge (city) also submitted a brief opposing the CTC sought by the company. It requested that the department abstain from ruling on the company\u2019s proposed auxiliary rates and its proposed CTC until the department had ruled on its own investigation into the restructuring of the electric industry.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> The city argued, in the alternative, that the company\u2019s failure to prepare for the emergence of cogenerators in its customer base had created the stranded costs that the company now sought to recover through the CTC; the city urged the department to disallow the company from recovering these costs from its remaining customers.</p>\n<p id=\"b884-6\">On September 28, 1995, the department issued its order (D.P.U. 94-101/95-36), in which it approved in relevant part each of the company\u2019s proposed auxiliary rates. In regard to the company\u2019s proposed CTC, the department concluded that a CTC was allowable and did not violate PURPA because it did not single out QFs, such as MIT\u2019s cogenerating facility, for discriminatory treatment. It then determined that the company could recover from MIT 75% of the CTC for which it had sought approval. It concluded that although MIT\u2019s cogeneration plant was \u201crepresentative of the business risk to which electric utilities have been exposed since at least 1978 when PURPA was enacted,\u201d the company \u201ccould well have regarded the MIT project as one of any number of plans by customers that do not go beyond the design or financing stage.\u201d The department noted that the load at-risk class, consisting of the company\u2019s seven largest customers including MIT, was \u201cbroad\u201d and \u201coverstated\u201d the risk to the company of all seven customers departing the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"865\">*865</page-number>company\u2019s system at the same time.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> The department nevertheless determined that this \u201coverstatement\u201d did not \u201cinvalidate the class as conceived.\u201d After \u201cbalancing] the interests of the load at risk class and the interests of [the city] and its other ratepayers by apportioning the stranded costs claimed by the Company,\u201d .the department determined that a CTC of 75% of the company\u2019s proposed charge was \u201cjust and reasonable under the unique circumstances of this case,\u201d and authorized a monthly CTC charge to MIT of $5.62 kVa, 75% of the $7.49 kVa that the company had proposed.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b885-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b885-6\">We address first MIT\u2019s argument that the CTC authorized by the department violates the department\u2019s PURPA regulations, 220 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7\u00a7 8.00-8.07. MIT asserts that the regulations require utilities to sell power to QFs such as its co-generating facility based on rate schedules that are nondiscriminatory as to a customer\u2019s sources of power, and based on the characteristics of the load served. The proposed CTC, says MIT, expressly discriminates against customers who have a source of power other than the company. We conclude that a customer transition charge for the recovery of verifiable, prudently incurred stranded costs, as such, on departing customers does not violate the department\u2019s PURPA regulations.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b885-7\">The State PURPA regulations, the purpose of which is \u201cto <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"866\">*866</page-number>establish rules ... for determining rates, terms, and conditions for the sale of electricity by utilities to . . . qualifying cogenerators,\u201d 220 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 8.01(1), are silent on the issue of recovering stranded costs from QFs; the regulations neither expressly authorize, nor expressly prohibit, the recovery of these costs through the means of a customer transition charge. MIT argues that the company\u2019s CTC violates 220 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 8.06, which specifically governs rates for supplementary, back-up, maintenance, and interruptible power to QFs pursuant to 18 C.F.R. \u00a7 292.305(b) (1997). We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-5\">First, because the CTC is not a rate for supplementary, back-up, maintenance, or interruptible power, that regulation neither governs, nor is violated by, the company\u2019s proposed CTC.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> Second, in light of the changing regulatory regime of the electricity industry, the recovery by utilities of prudent and verifiable stranded costs is consistent with sound public policy, as has increasingly been recognized in recent years. On April 24, 1996, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) issued Order No. 888, 61 Fed. Reg. 21,540 (1996)<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> in which it said that \u201crecovery of legitimate, prudent and verifiable stranded costs should be allowed,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 21,540, and specifically suggested that States consider imposing exit fees on departing customers as possible mechanisms to recover these costs.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> While FERC concluded that \u201cit is appropriate to leave it to state regulatory authorities to deal with any stranded costs occasioned by retail wheeling,\u201d<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> <em>id. </em>at 21,647, we find the FERC\u2019s policy to allow the recovery of stranded costs through a mechanism like an exit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"867\">*867</page-number>fee instructive.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> The department also has recognized that, in light of the changing regulatory landscape, the recovery of prudently incurred stranded costs by the utility is in the public interest. See D.P.U. 95-30, at 29-31 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b887-5\">Accordingly, we agree with the department that the imposition of a customer service charge that applies to a broad class of customers, and that does not single out QFs for unlawful discriminatory treatment, does not violate the State\u2019s PURPA regulations. We concur that the recovery of prudent and verifiable stranded costs incurred by utility companies, as appropriately authorized, is in the public interest and consistent with PURPA. We are not, however, persuaded by the department\u2019s decision or on the basis of the record before us that the stranded costs incurred by the company for which it seeks recovery from MIT necessarily were prudently incurred, as we describe below. Accordingly, we decline to affirm the department\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b887-7\">We turn to consider MIT\u2019s challenges to the calculation of the CTC itself, and its challenge to the department\u2019s approval of 75% of the CTC sought by the company. Our standard of review of petitions under G. L. c. 25, \u00a7 5, is well settled: a petition that raises no constitutional questions requires us to review the department\u2019s finding to determine only whether there is an error of law. See <em>Costello </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Utils., </em>391 Mass. 527, 532 (1984), and cases cited. The burden of proof is on the appealing party to show that the order appealed from is invalid, and we have observed that this burden is heavy. <em>Id. </em>at 533. <em>Wolf </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Utils., </em>407 Mass. 363, 367 (1990). Moreover, we give deference to the department\u2019s expertise and experience in areas where the Legislature has delegated to it decision-making authority, pursuant to G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14. We shall uphold an agency\u2019s decision unless it is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"868\">*868</page-number>based on an error of law, unsupported by substantial evidence, unwarranted by facts found on the record as submitted, arbitrary and capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law. G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14 (7). Moreover, we have acknowledged that the department has broad authority to determine ratemaking matters in the public interest. See <em>Wolf, supra </em>at 369; <em>Commonwealth Elec. Co. </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Utils., </em>397 Mass. 361, 369 (1986), cert, denied, 481 U.S. 1036 (1987); <em>Lowell Gas Light Co. </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Utils., </em>319 Mass. 46, 52 (1946); <em>Boston </em>v. <em>Edison Elec. Luminating Co., </em>242 Mass. 305, 309 (1922).</p>\n<p id=\"b888-5\">In order to make possible our determination of these questions of law, we \u201ccarefully review the department\u2019s findings for error.\u201d <em>Costello </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Utils., supra </em>at 533. We have observed in that respect that G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 11 (8), requires the decision of the department to \u201cbe accompanied by a statement of reasons . . . including determination of e\u00e1ch issue of fact or law necessary to the decision.\u201d See <em>id.; New York Cent. R.R. </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Utils., </em>347 Mass. 586, 593 (1964). A purpose of that statutory provision is to req\u00faire the department to give a \u201c \u2018guide to its reasons\u2019 so that this court may \u2018exercise . . . [its] function of appellate review.\u2019 There is thus a \u2018duty to make adequate subsidiary findings.\u2019 \u201d <em>Hamilton </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Utils., </em>346 Mass. 130, 137 (1963); quoting <em>Leen </em>v. <em>Assessors of Boston, </em>345 Mass. 494, 502 (1963). Without an adequate statement of reasons, \u201cwe are .unable to determine whether an appellant has met his burden of proof that a decision of the department is improper.\u201d <em>Costello, supra </em>at 533. Because this case concerns an issue of first impression, the need for an adequate statement of reasons by the department is even more pressing.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b888-6\">We find the department\u2019s decision inadequate in several material respects. First, the department has failed to make the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"869\">*869</page-number>subsidiary findings necessary for us to evaluate whether MIT has met its burden of proving that the company\u2019s calculations of its stranded costs are erroneous and that the department\u2019s decision to accept those calculations is erroneous.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> The department gives no explanation as to why it accepted the company\u2019s methodology and rejected MIT\u2019s challenges to the company\u2019s calculations; MIT challenged the stranded cost calculations on numerous grounds, none of which is addressed.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> By way of example, the company claimed that $6 million in stranded costs should be collected through a CTC. The methodology the company applied to calculate this amount was based on the hypothetical annual net stranded costs that would be incurred if the entire load at-risk class were to depart as full-service customers at the same time.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> In so doing it overstated the actual stranded costs incurred as a result of MIT\u2019s departure. In its decision, the department recognized that \u201cthe risk to [the company] of all these [load at-risk] customers\u2019 departing [the company\u2019s] system is overstated,\u201d but determined, without explanation, that the risk was \u201cnot enough to invalidate the class as conceived.\u201d We recognize that, in light of the evolving market, some reasonable approximation may be required. But <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"870\">*870</page-number>the department makes no findings to support or elucidate its conclusion that the risk of all seven customers departing is a reasonable approximation, or why the company\u2019s methodology of calculating the stranded costs by dividing the hypothetical costs equally among all potential departing customers is reasonable. We note, for example, that one member of the load at-risk class recently signed a seven-year contract with the company. The department apparently did not allow for any adjustment of the company\u2019s calculation of its actual stranded costs in light of this reality.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-5\">MIT offered testimony challenging other aspects of the company\u2019s stranded costs calculation. For example, MIT questioned whether the company understated the revenues it would receive from auxiliary service provided to departing customers, claimed that the company had used inappropriately low market prices for sales of its electricity generation, and underestimated its load growth. The result could be that the mitigation measures the company assumed in its calculation of stranded costs is significantly underestimated. We are not in a position to determine whether any of these or other claims by MIT are valid because the department failed to address them in its order. The department commented that some of the figures used to calculate the CTC \u201cinvolve assumptions by the Company that introduce a margin of error into the Company\u2019s calculation,\u201d and concluded that \u201c[ujnfortunately, these uncertainties cannot be precisely quantified in order to adjust the CTC,\u201d and that the quantification of these uncertainties is \u201cimpractical at this time of transition toward restructuring.\u201d<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> While we recognize that some uncertainties cannot be precisely quantified, we do require more than a conclusory statement to that effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-6\">We have said that in cases such as this, where the evidence is conflicting, the administrative agency is \u201ccharged with the responsibility of making findings of fact and is in the best position to judge the credibility of the witnesses.\u201d <em>Costello, supra </em>at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"871\">*871</page-number>536, quoting <em>School Comm, of Chicopee </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Comm\u2019n Against Discrimination, </em>361 Mass. 352, 354-355 (1972). But we have insisted that the agency make subsidiary findings of fact on all issues relevant and material to the ultimate issue to be decided, and that it \u201cset forth the manner in which it reasoned from the subsidiary facts so found to the ultimate decision reached.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The department\u2019s conclusions concerning the calculation of stranded costs do not meet these standards, leaving us no alternative but to speculate whether MIT\u2019s claims, have any merit. This we decline to do. See <em>Costello, supra </em>at 536, quoting <em>Northeast Airlines, Inc. </em>v. <em>Civil Aeronautics Bd., </em>331 F.2d 579, 586 (1st Cir. 1964) (\u201c[c]ourts ought not to have to speculate as to the basis for an administrative agency\u2019s conclusion\u201d).<footnotemark>34</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b891-5\">Second, the department has failed to explain why the allocation to MIT of 75% of the stranded costs as calculated by the company is reasonable.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> The apparent arbitrariness of this allocation is underscored by the concurring opinion in which one commissioner suggested, also with no findings to support her conclusion, that a 60% allocation would be more appropriate. General Laws c. 30A, \u00a7 11 (8), requires more from the department than merely stating in conclusive terms that such an allocation is \u201cjust and reasonable under the unique circumstances of this case.\u201d<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> We are also concerned that, assuming the calculation of stranded costs is supportable, assuming that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"872\">*872</page-number>stranded costs were prudently incurred, and assuming further that such costs are attributable to MIT\u2019s departure, the allocation the department approved \u2014 that 75% of the stranded costs be charged to MIT \u2014 may inappropriately leave the remainder of any such costs to be borne by the company\u2019s other ratepayers. The department\u2019s decision is ambiguous as to whether the remaining 25% is to be allocated to the company\u2019s other ratepayers or to be borne by the company\u2019s shareholders.<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> Any customer transition charge approved by the department must ensure that utility companies be allowed to recover only verifiable, prudent, and reasonable stranded costs, and that these costs be recovered from the parties to whom they are attributable \u2014 mainly the departing customers \u2014 and not the utilities\u2019 remaining ratepayers.<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> Before we are in a position to sustain an allocation of 75% of the stranded costs to MIT, we require a reasonable and more complete explanation from the department of its percentage allocation.<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> Merely listing the factors it considered in reaching its determination is not adequate. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"873\">*873</page-number>department does not explain how it balanced those factors, and on the record before us it appears that it gave little or no weight to at least two factors \u2014 the goal of encouraging competition and MIT\u2019s interest in lower rates \u2014 also without explanation. Because we are unable to conduct a meaningful review of the department\u2019s decision to allocate 75% of the stranded costs to MIT, we decline to \u201csupply a reasoned basis for the [department\u2019s] action that the [department] itself has not given.\u201d <em>Costello </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Utils., supra </em>at 536, quoting <em>Bowman Transp., Inc. </em>v. <em>Arkansas-Best Freight Sys., </em>419 U.S. 281, 285-286 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b893-5\">Third, we are concerned that there is inadequate explanation in the department\u2019s decision for us to determine whether the stranded costs for which the company now seeks relief were prudently incurred. We note that the Attorney General raised this concern before the department,<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> as did the city.<footnotemark>41</footnotemark> The department concluded that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b893-6\">\u201cAlthough it is not beyond dispute that [the company] did all it could to mitigate the loss of MIT in a timely way, we recognize that throughout the period when MIT was refining its self-generation planning, the Company also had an obligation to serve both all-requirements and partial-requirements customers. While MIT assessed the future course most advantageous to it, [the company] had to obtain resources available to serve all its customers. MIT was just such a customer, and given the narrow reserve capacity margins that existed in the late 1980\u2019s, the Company might well have been criticized had it proposed to treat MIT\u2019s plans since 1985 as absolving it of its obligation to serve that load.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b894-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"874\">*874</page-number>We cannot accept this conclusion of the department on the basis of the record before us.<footnotemark>42</footnotemark> The department has emphasized, in connection with the changing regulatory scheme governing the electric industry, that it has sought to promote the \u201caggressive mitigation of stranded costs.\u201d D.P.U. 96-100, at 55. The department has observed that \u201cutilities are in a position to avoid entering into or incurring new commitments and costs that might be stranded by the emergence of customer choice,\u201d and has \u201cdirect[ed] utilities to take immediate steps to avoid the creation of such costs.\u201d D.P.U. 95-30, at 32.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-5\">The department\u2019s concern with the reasonableness and prudence of stranded costs reflects the Federal policy on this issue. In Order No. 888, FERC addressed a request by interested parties to eliminate the term \u201cprudent\u201d from the definition of stranded costs. FERC declined to do so: \u201cwe will retain the requirement that stranded costs be legitimate, prudent and verifiable.\u2019 \u201d 61 Fed. Reg. 21,540, 21,664 (1996). FERC also noted that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b894-6\">\u201cPrudence of costs, depending upon the facts in a specific case, may include different things: e.g., prudence in operation and maintenance of a plant; prudence in continuing to own a plant when cheaper alternatives become available; prudence in entering into purchased power contracts, or continuing such contracts when buyouts or buy-downs of the contracts would result in savings. The Commission therefore cannot make a blanket assumption that all claimed stranded costs will have been prudently incurred.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b894-7\"><em>Id. </em>In this case, we, too, decline to make any \u201cblanket assumption\u201d that the costs the company now wishes to recover through its CTC were prudently incurred. The department acknowledged that it is \u201cnot beyond dispute\u201d that the company acted prudently in incurring these costs.<footnotemark>43</footnotemark> To allow a utility to recover imprudent or unreasonable costs would impede the very policies identified <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"875\">*875</page-number>by the department as worthy of promotion, the interests of customers in obtaining lower cost power and the public policy interests in encouraging competition as a means to increase efficiency.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-5\">For all these reasons we remand this matter to the department for further findings. The department should at a minimum provide us with a statement of reasons, including subsidiary findings, why it accepted the company\u2019s calculation of stranded costs in light of the conflicting testimony (and why it rejected MIT\u2019s challenges to each of the component parts of the calculation); why an allocation of 75% of those costs to MIT was not arbitrary; why it concluded the stranded costs for which the company seeks reimbursement through the CTC were prudently incurred. (and why it rejected claims by MIT, the Attorney General, and the city that the costs were not prudently incurred); and what, if any, steps the company undertook to \u201caggressively mitigate\u201d its costs, particularly in light of the advance notice that it had of MIT\u2019s departure. It should, in short, provide us with a decision on the basis of which we will be able to conduct our appellate review. <em>Costello </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Utils., </em>391 Mass. 527, 537 (1984); <em>School Comm. of Chicopee </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Comm\u2019n Against Discrimination, </em>361 Mass. 352, 355 (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b895-6\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b895-7\">Last, MIT argues that the application of the CTC violates principles prohibiting the inequitable retroactive application of new decisional law. The department rejected this argument, reasoning that, in D.P.U. 95-30, it had announced the policy that \u201cutilities should have a reasonable opportunity to recover, through an appropriately designed mechanism, net, non-mitigatable, stranded costs associated with commitments previously incurred pursuant to their legal obligation to serve.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b895-8\">In <em>Massachusetts Elec. Co. </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Utils., </em>383 Mass. 675 (1981), we observed that \u201c[ejvery administrative <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"876\">*876</page-number>adjudication which involves the application of a new standard of conduct has a retroactive effect and must therefore be subject to judicial scrutiny,\u201d and \u201cwhen the administrative agency does choose adjudication over rulemaking, judicial review must balance the adverse effects of retroactivity \u2018against the mischief of producing a result which is contrary to a statutory design or to legal and equitable principles. If that mischief is greater than the ill effect of the retroactive application of a new standard, it is not the type of retroactivity which is condemned by law.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 679, quoting <em>SEC </em>v. <em>Chenery Corp., </em>332 U.S. 194, 203 (1947). In <em>Massachusetts Elec. Co., supra </em>at 681, we upheld the department\u2019s action \u2014 the dismissal of a utility\u2019s rate filing \u2014 because (1) the policy to be enforced had been expressed by the department in earlier cases; (2) furtherance of that policy was within the department\u2019s powers; and (3) the dismissal did not run afoul of the <em>Chenery </em>balancing test.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-5\">While we recognize that the CTC at issue here was the first such charge authorized by the department to recover stranded costs from a departing customer, we take into consideration the fact that the department has announced its policy to allow utilities to recover stranded costs. See D.P.U. 95-30 (1995). Further, we agree with the department that approving such a charge is within the broad supervisory power granted to it by the Legislature in G. L. c. 164, \u00a7 94.<footnotemark>44</footnotemark> However, on the basis of the record before us, we cannot determine whether what was in this instance the retroactive imposition of the CTC would \u201crun afoul of the <em>Chenery </em>balancing test.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We observe, in particular, that the department does not address whether it is equitable to impose the CTC authorized here on MIT when MIT undertook the construction of its cogeneration facility years prior to the department\u2019s announcement in August, 1995, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"877\">*877</page-number>that stranded costs could be recovered by a utility company.<footnotemark>45</footnotemark> In a sense this consideration is the mirror image of the company\u2019s claim that it would be inequitable to allow MIT to exit the customer base when the company relied on it as a continued exclusive customer. As noted previously, MIT\u2019s construction of its cogeneration facility was consistent with national policy, and it may well be \u2014 we cannot discern from this record \u2014 that MIT could not reasonably have anticipated that stranded costs of the magnitude authorized here would be imposed on it.<footnotemark>46</footnotemark> We also note that the department\u2019s decision does not address MIT\u2019s claim that the financial burdens of the authorized CTC all but eliminate the benefits of cogeneration.<footnotemark>47</footnotemark> Whether or not MIT reasonably proceeded with the construction of its cogeneration facility in reliance on existing rules of the department and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"878\">*878</page-number>whether MlT has unreasonably been burdened with financial consequences that it could not have anticipated and that are not equitable cannot be discerned from the department\u2019s decision.<footnotemark>48</footnotemark> We are thus unable to determine whether the application of the CTC to MIT in the circumstances of this case \u201cis contrary to a statutory design or to legal and equitable principles.\u201d <em>Massachusetts Elec. Co., supra </em>at 679, quoting <em>Chenery, supra </em>at 203. The department must subject any stranded costs sought to be recovered by the company to careful scrutiny and to explain in a careful and reasonable manner why the imposition of such costs does not violate the strictures of <em>Chenery, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b898-5\">The case is remanded to the county court where, a judgment should be entered vacating the department\u2019s order and remanding the matter to the department for further findings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b877-10\">A \u201ccogeneration facility\u201d is one that produces both electric energy and steam or some other form of useful energy, such as heat. 16 U.S.C. \u00a7 796(18)(A).

First, on. January 5, 1996, MIT petitioned die Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) to initiate an enforcement action against the department pursuant to 16 U.S.C. \u00a7 824a-3(h), claiming that the CTC was discriminatory and in violation of Federal PURPA statutes.

Energy Reg. Comm\u2019n Rep.

On August 27, 1996, a judge of that court dismissed the case, determining that the court did not have jurisdiction over MIT\u2019s claim under 16 U.S.C. \u00a7 824a-3(h). <em>Massachusetts Inst. of Tech. </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Dep\u2019t of Pub.

The department does not address whether the company should have anticipated the loss of MIT before that date, nor does it discuss what steps, if any, the company took in anticipation of MIT\u2019s departure, either in 1991 or previously. Because the company may recover only prudently incurred stranded costs, the negotiations between MIT and the company prior to MIT\u2019s departure, and the company\u2019s response to that departure, are singularly relevant.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b880-7\">A \u201cqualifying cogeneration facility\u201d is \u201ca cogeneration facility which (i) the [FERC] determines, by rule, meets such requirements (including requirements respecting minimum size, fuel use, and fuel efficiency) as the [FERC] may, by rule, prescribe; and (ii) is owned by a person not primarily engaged in the generation or sale of electric power (other than electric power solely from cogeneration facilities or small power production facilities).\u201d 16 U.S.C. \u00a7 796(18)0).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b880-8\">MIT must currently purchase these services from the company because MET is in the company\u2019s franchise area.

MIT also argued that the department\u2019s regulations do not authorize charging stranded costs to QFs; that the CTC constituted an improper tying arrangement in violation of antitrust laws; and that applying the CTC to MIT would result in retroactive rulemaking, and was thus prohibited. The department rejected every argument.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b884-7\">The Attorney General argued specifically that the company \u201chas not demonstrated in this proceeding that the costs in question were incurred. prudently, i.e., that their incurrence was reasonable in light [of] the lack of a basis to assume MIT would remain a total requirements customer and that all reasonable steps were taken to mitigate any costs that were incurred prudently.\u201d On appeal to this court the Attorney General represents the department.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b884-8\">Subsequently, on August 16, 1995, the department issued Order 95-30 which sets forth its own policy in light of the restructuring of the electric industry.

The department summarized at length the company\u2019s position, then summarized MIT\u2019s objections and comments, as well as those of other participants in the proceedings, including the Attorney General and the city, and concluded by summarizing the company\u2019s responses to those, all without comment or guidance to us. Its \u201cAnalysis and Findings\u201d that follow are brief, sweeping, and are not supported by subsidiary findings. In its brief to this court, the department argues that the evidence \u201camply supported\u201d its approval of the company\u2019s calculations, referring us for the first time to numerous parts of the record. The barrage of footnotes in its brief is not an adequate substitute for the requisite subsidiary findings in its decision.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"31\">\n<p id=\"b889-7\">The department did observe that it \u201calso has concerns about the method of calculating the CTC,\u201d but did not attempt to explain why it resolved its concerns wholly in favor of the company.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"32\">\n<p id=\"b889-8\">We acknowledge that the company\u2019s CTC is intended to apply to any member of the load at-risk class that chooses to depart as a full requirements customer of the company. In reality, however, the only customer that will be subject,to the CTC at least at this time, the record indicates, is M3T.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"33\">\n<p id=\"b890-7\">In a similar vein, the department concluded, without elaboration, that the mitigating factors that the company had used to calculate its net stranded costs \u201cintroduce a margin of error into [the company\u2019s] calculation,\u201d noting that \u201c[c]ontinued service revenue, market value, and load growth mitigation are all difficult to project accurately.\u201d Again, the department does not explain why it rejected MIT\u2019s challenges to these calculations or why it accepted the company\u2019s proposed cost estimate. We are not able, therefore, to determine whether the department has reached a decision that should be sustained.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"34\">\n<p id=\"b891-6\">A witness on behalf of the company testified that \u201c[t]he methodology selected should be consistent with the overriding objectives of equity and economic efficiency,\u201d and that \u201cfrom both an equity and efficiency standpoint, the most appropriate way to collect [stranded] costs is to internalize these costs to those customers whose actions caused them to be stranded in the first place. . . . [Requiring customers responsible for such costs to pay them will serve to minimize the impacts on remaining customers who may not have the same alternatives.\u201d On the basis of the record before us, we are skeptical that the proposed CTC satisfies the company\u2019s own criteria.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"35\">\n<p id=\"b891-7\">The department determined that \u201cafter balancing the (1) Company\u2019s interests in recovering prudently incurred costs, (2) ratepayers\u2019 interests given the economic impact associated with the departure of a large customer of the Company, (3) load at risk class members\u2019 (including MIT) interests in obtaining lower cost power, and (4) public policy interests in encouraging competition as a means to increase efficiency ... a CTC of 75 percent of the net stranded costs as calculated by [the company] (or $5.62 per kVa) is just and reasonable under the unique circumstances of this case.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"36\">\n<p id=\"b891-8\">The department argues that MIT will pay only its share of the stranded costs caused by the departure of the load at-risk class, but it does not explain why the company\u2019s calculations, based as they were on so many assumptions, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"872\">*872</page-number>were \u201creasonable\u201d or why 75% of MIT\u2019s purported \u201cshare\u201d of the stranded costs caused by the load at-risk class is appropriate.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"37\">\n<p id=\"b892-6\">Both the Attorney General and the city had argued before the department that any stranded costs should not be borne by the company\u2019s remaining customers but by the company and MIT. The department stated in its brief that it has \u201cnot decided the extent to which the remaining ratepayers, as opposed to [the company] itself, should bear stranded costs that are not recoverable through the CTC.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"38\">\n<p id=\"b892-7\">Conversely, any stranded costs that are not verifiable, prudent, and reasonable should not be recoverable from the departing customer. A witness on behalf of the company testified that utility company shareholders should not bear the costs of stranded costs. We agree that the interests of a utility\u2019s shareholders may be protected, but only to the extent that the recovery of net stranded costs is limited to verifiable and prudent expenditures. On remand, the department should ensure that any authorization to recover stranded costs is consistent with the holding that \u201cthe function of the department is the protection of public interests and not the promotion of private interests.\u201d <em>Lowell Gas Light Co. </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Utils., </em>319 Mass. 46, 52 (1946). See <em>Commonwealth Elec. Co. </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Utils., </em>397 Mass. 361, 369 (1986), and cases cited.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"39\">\n<p id=\"b892-8\">In its brief to this court the department argues that it approved the CTC on MIT because the departure of MIT from the company <em>\u201ccould </em>cause a significant increase in the electric rates of the remaining customers [of the company].\u201d There is no finding by the department that this will, or is likely, to occur. We have upheld the apportionment of costs among the affected parties in order to minimize the impact on consumers and have recognized that allocation of these costs is within the department\u2019s discretion. <em>Attorney Gen. </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Utils., </em>390 Mass. 208, 231 (1983). Nevertheless, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"873\">*873</page-number>department must explain the rationale for its allocation before we can approve it. Here the department merely concludes that imposition of 75% of the net stranded costs is reasonable \u201cunder the unique circumstances of this case\u201d and that this apportionment on MIT \u201cis in the broad public interest.\u201d Without more, that is insufficient.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"40\">\n<p id=\"b893-8\">See note 19, <em>supra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"41\">\n<p id=\"b893-9\">The city argued before the department that the company did not take any measures to mitigate the financial consequences of MIT\u2019s cogeneration facility, that it did not begin planning for MIT\u2019s departure until 1993, when the department suggested that the company consider doing so, and that, between 1985 and 1992, when the company knew of MIT\u2019s cogeneration plans, the company continued to enter into multi-year purchase contracts, the shortest such contract being for a term of fifteen years.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"42\">\n<p id=\"b894-8\">There are no subsidiary findings supporting the ultimate finding, and the department appears to have accepted the company\u2019s argument, without addressing the specific challenges to its claim made by MIT, the Attorney General, or the city.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"43\">\n<p id=\"b894-9\">The department appears to have concluded, erroneously, that the company\u2019s \u201cgood faith\u201d negotiations with MIT (in an attempt to keep MIT as a full-service customer) absolved the company of any other efforts to mitigate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"875\">*875</page-number>its stranded costs: \u201cwhile questions have been raised about whether [the company] should have anticipated MIT\u2019s departure sooner and whether it should have acted earlier and more aggressively to reduce the impact on ratepayers of such an event, the Department finds no clear evidence of imprudence on [the company\u2019s] part. The record does not permit us to conclude that [the company] did not act in good faith in its negotiations to avoid losing MIT as a customer.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"44\">\n<p id=\"b896-6\">MIT had argued before the department that it lacked jurisdiction under G. L. c. 164, \u00a7 94, to approve the CTC because it did not directly relate to the sale or consumption of electricity. The department concluded that it did have jurisdiction, reasoning that the Legislature, through G. L. c. 164, \u00a7 94, had granted the department broad supervision and authority over electric companies, and citing similar charges approved and upheld charges not directly related to the sale or consumption of electricity. See, e.g., <em>Monsanto Co. </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Utils., </em>412 Mass. 25, 28 (1992) (upholding energy conservation charges which utilities required for the costs of demand-side management activities). MIT does not raise this claim on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"45\">\n<p id=\"b897-5\">In its decision the department did note that in D.P.U. 95-30 its focus was on stranded costs that \u201cmay arise as the result of Department initiatives to promote competition in the generation sector of the electric utility industry by giving customers access to other sources of electricity supply in addition to the electric company in whose territory these customers were located,\u201d that the company\u2019s authorization for the CTC tariff imposed on MIT \u201cdiffers somewhat\u201d from that model, and that the company\u2019s filing for authorization of the CTC predated D.P.U. 95-30. The department did not specifically address the issue of retroactivity except to state summarily that \u201c[i]n fairness, the Company should have a reasonable opportunity to recover its investments, including those undertaken to serve MIT,\u201d citing <em>Federal Power Comm\u2019n </em>v. <em>Hope Natural Gas Co., </em>320 U.S. 591 (1944); <em>Bluefield Water Works &amp; Improvement Co. </em>v. <em>Public Serv. Comm\u2019n of W. Va., </em>262 U.S. 679 (1923).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"46\">\n<p id=\"b897-6\">The Energy Policy Act of 1992, Pub. L. 102-486, 106 Stat. 2776 (1992), sanctioned wholesale power competition by, inter alia, instructing FERC to order utilities to provide access to the nation\u2019s transmission grid to third-party suppliers. The department has recognized that this dramatically new economic and regulatory framework threatens to reduce the \u201copportunity that currently exists for electric utility companies to recover their past investments in generating plants.\u201d It is noteworthy, however, that MIT\u2019s cogeneration facility is of a kind long sanctioned by national and local energy policy and that MIT\u2019s commitment to build its facility predated any efforts by the department to respond to the restructuring of the electric industry at large.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"47\">\n<p id=\"b897-7\">The department argues that MIT could not reasonably have relied upon \u201ca particular resolution\u201d of the question of stranded cost recovery applied to it, because the department previously had not addressed a situation \u201cin which a large customer of a small utility discontinued its all-requirements purchases from that utility but remained in that utility\u2019s service territory.\u201d If the department is to rely on its later articulated principles as described in D.P.U. 95-30, it is incumbent on it to articulate how it assessed MIT\u2019s interests in obtaining lower cost power and the public policy interests in encouraging competition as a means to increase efficiency, and that these interests were not made subservient to the company\u2019s interests in recovering its stranded costs.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"48\">\n<p id=\"b898-7\">The department argues that in the context of the larger developments that are taking place in the electric industry, the transitional recovery of stranded costs is in the public interest and that the department had the responsibility to balance the relevant interests in this case in the exercise of its broad ratemaking discretion. We agree. But this does not absolve the department from considering whether the general principles regarding the recovery of stranded costs as articulated in D.P.U. 95-30, and as applied specifically to this cogeneration facility brought on-line prior to 1995, run afoul of equitable principles.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
