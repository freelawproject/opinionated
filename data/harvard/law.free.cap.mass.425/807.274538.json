Represented by new counsel on appeal, the defendant contends that a new trial is required because of error in the admission of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) test results that tended to identify samples recovered from the defendant\u2019s automobile as coming from the victim, and in the jury instructions concerning evaluation of the DNA evidence and tibe issue of intoxication. We reject the defendant\u2019s arguments. We also find no basis to exercise our authority pursuant to G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E, to grant the defendant any relief. Consequently, we affirm his conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-5\">We first provide an overview of the Commonwealth\u2019s case against the defendant. After attending a party where people were watching football, drinking beer, and smoking marihuana, the defendant drove away in an automobile with the victim. A witness testified that he saw the victim and the defendant at the party talking and drinking beer, and that they both appeared to be drunk. The next day, hunters found the victim alive in the Pittsfield State Forest. She was barely breathing, clothed only from the waist up, and covered with blood. Her face was badly beaten, and she had deep abrasions, open wounds, and \u201croad bums\u201d on both sides of her legs. Her torso was scraped and bruised, and she had bruises and red marks around her neck. The victim died two hours after being mshed to a hospital. A State trooper involved in the investigation observed, approximately one-half mile away from the main gate of the State forest, skid marks going off the road and a tree that appeared to have been hit by an automobile (as evidenced by the transference of paint). The trooper recovered pieces of shattered safety glass and a piece of black plastic imprinted with a series of numbers and the Ford Motor Company logo.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-6\">The medical examiner testified that his autopsy of the victim revealed injuries that were consistent with large blunt trauma, which could have been caused either by impact or by compression. He stated that, if the victim had been struck by an automobile, the injuries were consistent with the body\u2019s being struck while in a crawling or semi-prone position. He expressed the opinion that all of the injuries were consistent with the victim\u2019s having been struck, run over, and dragged by an automobile, in two different directions.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-7\">On the night of the murder, the defendant was driving a Mercury Capri automobile (a Ford Motor Company product), owned by his girl friend\u2019s father. The defendant told the father, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"809\">*809</page-number>when questioned about damage to the vehicle\u2019s passenger side door and a broken window, that someone had backed into it.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The next day, the defendant asked a friend if he had heard about the girl killed in the State forest; his friend responded, \u201cWhat the hell did you do now?\u201d The defendant replied that he had \u201cfucked up\u201d and killed her. The defendant went on to explain that he had had sexual intercourse with the victim, after which they engaged in a violent argument. The defendant stated to his friend that he had thrown the victim and her clothing out of the automobile, had hit and \u201cstomped\u201d on her \u201cto shut her up,\u201d and then had backed the automobile over the victim and had driven forward again, running her over once more. The defendant also told a cellmate at the Berkshire County house of correction that, \u201c[l]ike that girl, I know I did it, I know I killed that girl.\u201d The defendant warned this witness not to tell anyone about his admission.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-5\">We next describe the background of the DNA evidence. During its investigation, the State police recovered bloodstains from the undercarriage of the Mercury Capri, from a tire, and from the inside passenger side of the vehicle. The State police also recovered \u201ca white threadlike substance\u201d that appeared to be human tissue from the undercarriage. The Commonwealth engaged Cellmark Diagnostics (Cellmark), a recognized forensic laboratory located in Germantown, Maryland, to perform DNA testing on two blood stains taken from the undercarriage of the automobile, one blood stain from the front tire on the passenger side, one blood stain taken from the passenger side quarter panel, the threadlike substance that appeared to be human tissue found on the undercarriage, a blood sample taken from the victim, and one taken from the defendant.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Cellmark completed the testing using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method, and submitted a written report to the State police. The report concluded that PCR-based testing disclosed that the victim could not be excluded as the source of the DNA obtained from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"810\">*810</page-number>three of the blood stain samples and the human tissue sample,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and that the approximate frequencies in the Caucasian and African-American populations between the genotypes analyzed in the sample, when compared with the same genotypes obtained from the victim\u2019s blood sample, were 1 in 770,000 for the Caucasian population and 1 in 7.5 million for the African-American population.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-5\">The defendant filed a motion in limine to exclude the Cell-mark DNA test results from evidence. A judge .in the .Superior Court held an evidentiary hearing on the motion,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> where he heard testimony from two prospective Commonwealth witnesses, Dr. Charlotte J. Word, a microbiologist specializing in DNA identification testing and Senior Scientist at Cellmark, and Dr. Christopher J. Basten, a population geneticist from North Carolina State University. After the hearing, the judge entered a memorandum of decision in which he concluded \u201cthat the proffered expert opinion evidence concerning the results of Cell-mark\u2019s PCR-based DNA testing in this case, as well as expert opinion evidence as to the validity and reliability of Cellmark\u2019s statistical analysis, will assist the trier of fact to understand the evidence or otherwise to determine a fact in issue [and] that the results are scientifically valid and reliable, and that the testimony which [the court] heard complies with the standard enunciated in both <em>[Daubert </em>v. <em>Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc.; </em>509 U.S. 579, 592-595 (1993), and <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lanigan, 419 </em>Mass. 15, 24-27 (1994)].\u201d The DNA test results were admitted in evidence before the jury through the testimony of Dr. Word and Dr. Basten (and two other witnesses), and no issue is raised that the defendant has not preserved the right to challenge the judge\u2019s rulings on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-6\">1. We turn now to the issues involving the DNA evidence. As has been indicated, the samples submitted by the State police for DNA analysis were examined by the PCR method,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and Cellmark performed DQA1, PM, and STR testing, using three</p>\n<p id=\"b831-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"811\">*811</page-number>commercial kits.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> We have explained the PCR method and the process of testing at the DQA1 and PM loci in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Vao Sok, ante </em>787, 790-792 (1997). We need to explain STR testing.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> STR is an acronym for short tandem repeat. A tandem repeat involves multiple copies of identical DNA sequence arranged in direct succession in a particular region of a chromosome. A short tandem repeat is a tandem repeat in which the repeat units are three, four, or five base pairs (a base pair has two complementary nucleotides). Loci containing STRs are scattered throughout the chromosomes in enormous numbers. Such loci have a fairly large number of alleles and are usually capable of unique identification. Cellmark tested at three STR loci,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> which, in combination with the testing at the DQA1 and PM loci, gave results from nine different loci. The STR testing became important in the case because Cellmark had done prior DNA testing on the samples submitted examining only the DQA1 and PM loci and had concluded, based on results from those loci, that the population frequencies between the victim and the Caucasian and African-American population were 1 in 5,500 and 1 in 11,000 respectively. The additional testing of the STR loci, when considered with the results of the DQA1 and PM testing, increased the probabilities to 1 in 770,000 (Caucasian) and 1 in 7.5 million (African-American). As Dr. Basten agreed, STR analysis made a \u201csignificant difference\u201d in terms of the frequency in which the genetic markers would be expected to be seen within a population. As the judge found: \u201cAt the CSF1PO locus, scientists have observed nine different alleles, giving rise to 45 possible genotypes. At the TP0X locus, seven different alleles have been observed, giving rise to 28 possible genotypes. At the TH01 locus, eight different alleles have been observed, giving rise to 36 possible genotypes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b831-5\">At the hearing on the motion in limine, the defendant did not specifically challenge the collection and preservation of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"812\">*812</page-number>samples submitted to Cellmark for DNA testing, the quality control and assurance standards at the laboratory,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> the use of the PCR method, the reliability of the three test procedures, or the accuracy of the test results obtained from the use of the typing kits. The judge had an ample basis for finding Dr. Word and Dr. Basten to be well-qualified experts in their respective fields, and he left no doubt about the effect of their testimony when he stated in his memorandum that \u201cI find Dr. Word and Dr. Basten to be extremely impressive, superbly qualified, and completely credible witnesses.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b832-5\">The PCR method is scientifically valid, and testing at the DQA1 and PM loci is scientifically reliable, if properly done. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Vao Sok, supra </em>at 801-802. The defendant\u2019s appellate counsel appears to suggest that STR testing is unreliable because it is too new. No specific scientific or forensic evidence or literature is offered to support that suggestion. The judge heard testimony that, in 1991, several years before the STR kit became commercially available, Cellmark, working under contract to the United States government, used STR testing to identify the remains of soldiers killed in Operation Desert Storm, and that, by the time of the hearing, Cellmark had performed STR analysis in approximately fifty cases and had been permitted to testify as to its test results in at least five cases.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> While we have not been directed to any decisional law approving STR testing, an authoritative scientific study, the 1996 report of the National Research Council entitled The Evaluation of Forensic DNA Evidence (1996 NRC Report), has concluded <em>(id. </em>at 71) that STR testing is \u201ccoming into wide use,\u201d that \u201cSTR loci appear to be particularly appropriate for forensic use\u201d <em>(id. </em>at 117), and that \u201cSTRs can take their place along with VNTRs as forensic tools\u201d <em>(id. </em>at 35). The latter <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"813\">*813</page-number>comment appears to recognize that STR testing is similar in principle to the RFLP (or VNTR) method, which has been found to be reliable. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Daggett, </em>416 Mass. 347, 350 n.1 (1993). Based on the evidence before him and his careful analysis of the subject, the judge properly concluded that the methodology underlying the PCR-based tests in this case, including the STR testing, was scientifically valid and relevant to a fact at trial. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lanigan, supra </em>at 26.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b833-5\">The defendant\u2019s principal attack on the DNA results is focused on the evidence pertaining to the statistical significance of the match found by the three tests between the DNA in the blood stains and tissue taken from the automobile and the victim\u2019s DNA. Evidence of a match based on correctly used testing systems is of little or no value without reliable evidence indicating the significance of the match, that is, \u201cevidence of the probability of a random match of [the victim\u2019s or] the defendant\u2019s DNA in the general population.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lanigan, supra </em>at 20. To obtain the relevant statistical results in this case, Cellmark used a database it had developed using samples taken from paternity studies done at Cellmark.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> At the time of the hearing, Cellmark\u2019s database was the only one that used samples from the same persons for all of the nine loci analyzed under the DQA1, PM, and STR tests used by Cell-mark. The statistical results were calculated by means of the product rule. \u201cUnder the product rule, the frequency in the population base of each allele disclosed in the DNA test is multiplied to produce the frequency of the combination of all the alleles found.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lanigan, supra </em>at 21, citing <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Curnin, </em>409 Mass. 218, 224 n.10, 225 n.11 (1991). The defendant argues that Cellmark\u2019s database is too small and, for various other reasons, unreliable.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-6\">The judge acted properly in rejecting the defendant\u2019s arguments. He accepted the expert testimony that the Cellmark database was adequate and common within the field and that a database larger than Cellmark\u2019s would produce \u201cno significant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"814\">*814</page-number>difference in the result.\u201d There was expert and scientific evidence that the Cellmark database met two factors critical to the reliability of a database. The first factor, \u201clinkage equilibrium\u201d (LE), establishes that the various chromosomal loci identified in a database occur randomly in proportion to one another, thus assuring that results related to one locus are not affected by, nor predictive of, the results related to another.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The second factor is \u201cHardy-Weinberg equilibrium\u201d (HW). A database is considered to be \u201cin HW\u201d when the predicted values for the various loci within the database actually correspond to those found in the population, assuming mates are randomly chosen. Thus, it was properly found that the Cellmark database was both in LE and in HW. The database and statistical results reached by Cellmark were also independently verified by Dr. Basten through calculations of \u201cconfidence intervals\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> and a comparison of Cellmark\u2019s results with other databases that achieved statistically comparable results.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Dr. Basten also concluded that the methods used by Cellmark to generate statistical results are \u201cgenerally accepted\u201d within the field of population genetics, and that the statistical results they produce are reliable and accurate.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-5\">At the motion hearing, the defendant did not make any argument that Cellmark\u2019s use of the product rule to reach its conclusions about population frequencies was wrong. We think it is appropriate, however, to discuss the product rule to assure <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"815\">*815</page-number>completeness in the examination of this phase of the case. In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lanigan, supra </em>at 21, we stated that \u201c[t]he product or multiplication rule is based on the assumption that the population does not contain subpopulations with distinct allele frequencies, and, therefore, each person\u2019s alleles constitute statistically independent random selections from a common gene pool.\u201d We went on to state that \u201c[t]he validity of the use of the multiplication rule thus depends on the absence of population substructure. If there is population substructure, the assumption of complete statistical independence of alleles is not valid.\u201d <em>Id. </em>To ameliorate this problem, we accepted the recommendation that population frequencies be calculated by use of \u201cthe ceiling principle,\u201d which was \u201cadopted to make irrelevant the dispute among population geneticists over the question whether the product rule may properly be used to express numerically the probability of finding a DNA match in a random selection of the appropriate population.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 26. The ceiling principle was recommended by the National Research Council in its 1992 Report on The Evaluation of Forensic DNA Evidence to help quiet the significant debate over potential problems arising out of population substructuring.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b835-5\">It is fair to say that the controversy has been resolved in large part. The 1996 NRC Report notes <em>(id. </em>at 53) that \u201cinformation is now available from a number of relevant populations, so that experts can usually base estimates on an appropriate database.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"816\">*816</page-number>In considering the same question, the admissibility of statistical evidence calculated under the product rule, the Supreme Court of Washington cited a major Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) study of VNTR frequency data from around the world entitled VNTR Population Data: A Worldwide Study (Feb. 1993) (Worldwide Study), which concluded that the product rule is reliable and valid.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> <em>State </em>v. <em>Copeland, </em>130 Wash. 2d 244, 267-268 (1996), quoting Worldwide Study, <em>supra </em>at 2. That report has been supported by other studies that have similarly concluded that differences of allelic distribution are not forensically significant,<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> and courts that have examined the question have agreed that challenges to the use of the product rule have been sufficiently resolved. See, e.g., <em>Lindsey </em>v. <em>People, </em>892 P.2d 281, 292 (Colo. 1995); <em>Armstead </em>v. <em>State, </em>342 Md. 38, 83 (1996); <em>People </em>v. <em>Chandler, </em>211 Mich. App. 604, 610 (1995), overruled on other grounds, <em>People </em>v. <em>Edgett, </em>220 Mich. App. 686 (1996); <em>State </em>v. <em>Copeland, supra </em>at 269. It is important to note as well: \u201cThe ceiling principles were intended for VNTRs with many alleles, no one of which has a very high frequency [and tjhey are not applicable to PCR-based systems.\u201d 1996 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"817\">*817</page-number>NRC Report at 158.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> We agree with the conclusions of the 1996 NRC Report that \u201cboth the ceiling principle and the interim ceiling principle are unnecessary,\u201d <em>(id. </em>at 162) and that \u201c[i]n general, the calculation of a profile frequency should be made with the product rule,\u201d <em>(id. </em>at 5) both for VNTR- and PCR-based systems.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Thus, the use of the product rule by Cell-mark in connection with its PCR-based testing in this case was scientifically acceptable.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-5\">2. We reject the defendant\u2019s arguments that, in two areas, the jury instructions were flawed.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-6\">(a) The judge refused to give the jury instruction that was requested by the defendant with respect to DNA evidence. There is no requirement that a judge give a special instruction on the role of DNA evidence. The judge had discretion in determining how he would instruct the jury on the issue. He gave a comprehensive and correct instruction on the evaluation of expert testimony, listing the witnesses who testified on the DNA evidence among the experts to whom the instruction applied, and he told the jury that they could, among other factors, \u201cconsider the soundness of the scientific or technical principles, the methods employed, and the results reached, as well as the soundness of the reasons underlying the expert\u2019s opinion.\u201d The judge\u2019s instructions were satisfactory.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-7\">(b) The judge adequately instructed the jury as to the evidence of the defendant\u2019s intoxication with respect to their consideration of the issues of premeditation, malice, and extreme atrocity or cruelty. Contrary to the defendant\u2019s claim, the judge also made the jury aware that the defendant\u2019s intoxication could reduce his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"818\">*818</page-number>culpability from murder in the first degree to murder in the second degree. We have not required that an intoxication instruction use the exact language in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Delle Chiaie, </em>323 Mass. 615, 617-618 (1949). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Freiberg, </em>405 Mass. 282, 303, cert, denied, 493 U.S. 940 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b838-5\">3. There is no merit to the defendant\u2019s argument that he should obtain relief under G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E, because the jury did not hear evidence of specific intent sufficient to warrant findings that he committed the killing with deliberate premeditation or in a manner manifesting extreme atrocity or cruelty. The evidence warranted the jury\u2019s finding that the defendant\u2019s actions were deliberate. \u201cIn particular, the fact that the defendant backed the car over the victim after he had run over her once could have been found by the jury to evidence intent.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Amazeen, </em>375 Mass. 73, 81 (1978). The evidence also warranted a finding that the murder was intentionally committed with extreme atrocity or cmelty.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b829-6\">Later the next day, the defendant admitted to his girl friend that he had hit a tree.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b829-7\">Despite the powerful nature of the Commonwealth\u2019s proof against the defendant adumbrated above, the prosecution appears to have decided that DNA testing was needed as a precaution to forestall any claim by the defendant that the bloodstains and human tissue taken from the Mercury Capri belonged to someone other than the victim.

The result would be a composite profile frequency that did not depend on a specific racial or ethnic database and would practically always exceed the frequency calculated from the database of the reference populations.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b835-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 52.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b836-5\">VNTR Population Data: A Worldwide Study (Feb. 1993), at 2, concluded as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b836-6\">\u201c(1) that there are sufficient population data available to determine whether or not forensically significant differences might occur when using different population databases; (2) that subdivision, either by ethnic group or by U.S. geographic region, within a major population group does not substantially affect forensic estimates of the likelihood of occurrence of a DNA profile; (3) that estimates of the likelihood of occurrence of a DNA profile using major population group databases (e.g., Caucasian, Black, and Hispanic) provide a greater range of frequencies than would estimates from subgroups of a major population category; therefore, the estimate of the likelihood of occurrence of a DNA profile derived by the current practice of employing the multiplication rule and using general population databases for allele frequencies is reliable, valid, and meaningful, without forensically significant consequences; and (4) that the data do not support the need for alternate procedures, such as the ceiling principle approach.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b836-7\">See, e.g., Budowle, The Assessment of Frequency Estimates of Hae DC-Generated VNTR Profiles in Various Reference Databases, 39 J.

Because PCR-based testing identifies specific alleles and genotypes at specific loci, the arguments voiced by critics of the product rule as applied to RFLP testing do not apply to PCR-based testing.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b837-9\">The 1996 NRC Report also recommends that \u201c[i]f the race of the person who left the evidence sample DNA is known, the database for the person\u2019s race should be used; if the race is not known, calculations for all the racial groups to which possible suspects belong should be made.\u201d 1996 NRC Report at 5 (Recommendation 4.1 of the Recommendations for Estimating Random-Match Probabilities). Recommendations 4.2, 4.3, and 4.4 suggest calculation methodologies for cases where a subpopulation is involved (4.2), where the source of the DNA sample is from a subpopulation for which no database exists (4.3), and where all possible contributors of the sample include relatives of the subject (4.4), situations that complicate the application of the product rule. 1996 NRC Report at 5-6.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
