The assault by means of a dangerous weapon charge was placed on file with the defendant\u2019s consent. The defendant was given consecutive sentences of life imprisonment without parole on the murder convictions. He also received sentences of from nine to ten years on the assault and battery <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>by means of a dangerous weapon conviction and from three to five years on the firearm conviction, both of which were ordered to be served concurrently with the first life sentence. The defendant appeals from the several convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-5\">The evidence relevant to this appeal is as follows. At approximately 10:30 p.m. on October 2, 1992, Ronald Price, known as \u201cDallas,\u201d and his brother, Roosevelt Price, known as \u201cTony,\u201d left their mother\u2019s apartment located in the Orchard Park housing project in the Roxbury section of Boston and went to a nearby bar called the Biarritz Lounge. They were soon joined there by two friends, Leroyal Holmes and Fred Monroe. The defendant was also present in the bar, accompanied by Junior Williams.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-6\">Dallas approached the defendant around 1:30 a.m. on October 3 and said, \u201cI heard you [have] been looking for me on Shawmut.\u201d The defendant responded, \u201cI don\u2019t even know you, man,\u201d to which Dallas stated, \u201cPm the one that stabbed your cousin.\u201d Dallas and the defendant then separated, but a few minutes later a fight erupted between them. Dallas\u2019s brother, Tony, became involved, putting the defendant in a headlock. Others in the bar broke up the fight and the defendant was escorted to the sidewalk just outside the bar. Tony then left the bar and the defendant approached him. After exchanging words, the defendant and Tony began to fight. The defendant stabbed Tony underneath his right armpit with a knife. Leroyal Holmes grabbed the knife from the defendant and separated the two combatants.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-7\">Meanwhile, inside the bar, Junior Williams had initiated a heated confrontation with Dallas. The two men grasped each other\u2019s jackets. Dallas said to Williams, \u201cI don\u2019t understand why you\u2019re with [the defendant] against me,\u201d and \u201cYou\u2019re supposed to be my cousin, how [can] you turn on me for another person . . . ?\u201d Williams responded, \u201cI\u2019m not your cousin no more . . . [the defendant is] my [friend] from Columbia Point. . . [he\u2019s] down with me.\u201d Williams also told Dallas that he was not going to lose his friendship with the defendant because the defendant \u201cputs his life on the line [for Williams] every day.\u201d Dallas and Williams were ultimately separated. Williams then left the bar, and the defendant and Williams drove away in Williams\u2019s black Ford Escort automobile, with Williams driving and the defendant in the passenger seat.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>After stopping briefly at their mother\u2019s house, Dallas and Tony, accompanied by their friends, Holmes and Monroe, headed to another bar in the area. On their way, they saw Monroe\u2019s girl friend, Mattie Buford, in a Geo Tracker automobile driven by Donna Carrington, a friend of Buford. After speaking with them, Carrington parked the automobile facing Washington Street in a parking lot bounded on three sides by Harrison Avenue, Washington Street, and Palmer Street. After being informed that it was too late to enter the second bar, the four men walked back to the Geo Tracker.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-5\">A dark Ford Escort then came into view on Washington Street and turned abruptly down Palmer Street, disappearing behind a building. Dallas observed, \u201cThere goes Junior [Williams\u2019s] car.\u201d Holmes, being concerned, walked across the parking lot toward Palmer Street to investigate.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-6\">When Holmes arrived at the comer of the parking lot nearest Palmer Street, a man identified at the trial by Holmes, Monroe, and Buford as the defendant, came around the comer and into the parking lot. After exchanging words with Holmes, the man drew a revolver and pointed it at Holmes, demanding that Holmes get out of his way. Holmes stepped aside, and the gunman proceeded across the parking lot toward the Geo Tracker. Holmes then yelled to his friends that the person approaching the Geo Tracker had a gun. Monroe and Buford ran from the Geo Tracker, while Dallas and Tony, who had climbed into the back seat, remained there. Carrington slouched down beneath the steering wheel and did not get a good look at the gunman. The gunman approached the back window of the Geo Tracker and fired one or more bullets at Dallas and Tony in the back seat. He then moved to the passenger side window, which was lowered, and fired one or more additional bullets at Dallas and Tony. The gunman then ran down Washington Street, past Monroe and Buford. Dallas had been struck by one bullet and Tony had been struck by two bullets.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-7\">Carrington then drove the Geo Tracker a very short distance to the building in which Tony\u2019s girl friend lived, and Tony, who had been seriously wounded, got out of the Geo Tracker. Holmes and Monroe drove Dallas to the hospital where he was pronounced dead.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-8\">The police were called to the building in which Tony\u2019s girl friend lived and, when they arrived, they encountered Tony, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>who was in obvious pain and told the officers that he had been shot. In response to questions from two different officers, Tony twice stated that \u201cJunior [Williams] did it,\u201d and provided additional details regarding the shooting and Junior\u2019s identity. During this time, Tony told his girl friend \u201cto take care of [their] baby because [I\u2019m not] coming back.\u201d Moments later, Tony was taken by ambulance to the hospital where he later died from the gunshot wounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-5\">On the first day of trial, the Commonwealth filed a motion in limine for leave to introduce evidence of out-of-court statements made by Dallas Price \u201cindicating that the defendant was seeking to kill him.\u201d The prosecutor argued that the testimony was admissible to show Dallas\u2019s state of mind. Over the defendant\u2019s written opposition, the judge allowed the Commonwealth\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-6\">Edie Price, the mother of Dallas and Tony, then testified that, when Dallas returned home from the Biarritz Lounge briefly on the night of the shooting, he said to her, \u201c [Everywhere I go and I look back, [the defendant] is right behind me, looking right over my shoulder . . . [the defendant is] the one that was threatening me all the time. ... I think he\u2019s going to try to kill me tonight.\u201d After Edie Price testified, defense counsel renewed his objection, and the judge instructed the jury as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b186-7\">\u201cOrdinarily, we do not permit a witness to testify to a conversation with someone else. However, we do have some exceptions to that hearsay rule and, in this case, I\u2019m permitting this witness to testify as to what her son said to her that evening for a very limited purpose: one, as evidence of possible motive in the case \u2014 it is for you to decide eventually whether or not it is evidence of motive of anything or if it isn\u2019t \u2014 and, also, as evidence of the state of mind of her son at the time she alludes to, evidence of her son\u2019s state of mind, not for the truth of the words asserted actually.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b186-8\">Marie Fletcher, Dallas\u2019s girl-friend, testified that on the night before the shooting, Dallas said to her, \u201c[RJemember, I told you about this dude, Ron Qualls, that wanted to kill me. . . . [The defendant is] after [me] for something that happened a long time ago. . . . [H]e\u2019s gonna kill me.\u201d Before Marie Fletcher testified, the judge referred the jury to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>limiting instruction he had given following Edie Price\u2019s testimony, that is that the testimony was admitted \u201cas evidence of possible motive [and] as evidence of [Dallas\u2019s] state of mind, not for the troth of the words asserted.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b187-5\">The judge repeated that instruction after September Sturrup, Dallas\u2019s close friend, testified. She testified that approximately one week before the shooting, Dallas said to her that the defendant \u201cwas back and [Dallas] felt like [the defendant] was going to get him this time.\u201d Sturrup testified that Dallas also said, \u201cEither [the defendant\u2019s] going to get me or I\u2019ll have to get him.\u201d In addition, she testified that a few years before the shooting, as she and Dallas were walking in Orchard Park, Dallas saw the defendant and commented, \u201c[H]ere comes that dude again . . . [d]on\u2019t turn around. . . I\u2019m going to cut through the building and I\u2019ll meet you up on Dudley.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b187-6\">Leroyal Holmes testified that, in the Biarritz Lounge on the night of the shooting, Dallas stated that his \u201cworst enemy was in the bar.\u201d The judge, once again, referred the jury to the limiting instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-7\">On every occasion that the Commonwealth elicited the above testimony, defense counsel objected and those objections were overruled. At the close of the Commonwealth\u2019s case, defense counsel moved to strike the testimony \u201crelative to Dallas Price\u2019s state of mind, and whether or not that reflects on [the defendant\u2019s] motive or feeling towards Dallas Price.\u201d The judge denied the defendant\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-8\">\u201cThe broad rule on hearsay evidence interdicts the admission of a statement made out of court which is offered to prove the truth of what it asserted.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>DelValle, </em>351 Mass. 489, 491 (1966), <em>S.C., </em>353 Mass. 684 (1968). However, \u201cthe state of mind or intent of a person, whenever material, may be shown by his declarations out of court.\u201d <em>Goldman, petitioner, </em>331 Mass. 647, 651 (1954), cert, denied sub nom. <em>Goldman </em>v. <em>Fogarty, </em>348 U.S. 942 (1955). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Trefethen, </em>157 Mass. 180, 181-188 (1892). The state-of-mind exception to the hearsay rule calls for admission of evidence of a murder victim\u2019s state of mind as proof of the defendant\u2019s motive to kill the victim when and only when there also is evidence that the defendant was aware of that state of mind at the time of the crime and would be likely to respond to it. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cruz, </em>424 Mass. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>207, 212 (1997); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Hunter, 416 Mass. 831, 837 (1994); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Zagronski, </em>408 Mass. 278, 283 (1990); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Olszewski, </em>401 Mass. 749, 759 (1988), <em>S.C., </em>416 Mass. 707 (1993), cert, denied, 513 U.S. 835 (1994); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Todd, </em>394 Mass. 791, 797 (1985). A murder victim\u2019s attitude of contempt or hostility toward the defendant, when it is known to the defendant, would constitute some evidence which, augmented by other evidence, might warrant a fact finder\u2019s determination that the defendant responded by killing the victim. However, a victim\u2019s contempt for the defendant or hostile attitude toward him, unknown to the defendant, would be irrelevant and inadmissible at the defendant\u2019s trial for murder. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Borodine, </em>371 Mass. 1, 8 (1976), cert, denied, 429 U.S. 1049 (1977) (\u201cObviously, the victim\u2019s state of mind can be relevant to the defendant\u2019s motive only if there is reason to believe that the defendant knew of that state of mind\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b188-5\">In its argument that the judge did not commit reversible error by admitting evidence of Dallas Price\u2019s state of mind, the Commonwealth\u2019s principal focus is on the testimony of September Sturrup. The Commonwealth also argues, although briefly, that Leroyal Holmes\u2019s testimony was admissible. The Commonwealth does not argue, however, that the state of mind testimony given by Edie Price and Marie Fletcher was properly admitted. Instead, the Commonwealth makes the following two statements in its brief: (1) \u201cAlthough perhaps it would have been better if the statements made by Marie Fletcher and Edie Price had not been offered, the balance of the testimony was properly admitted as probative evidence of the victim\u2019s state of mind toward the defendant, and therefore there was no reversible error\u201d; (2) \u201cAlthough it was probably error to admit the statements of Edie Price and Marie Fletcher . . . such evidence was merely cumulative of other, properly admitted evidence, and therefore no reversible error occurred.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b188-6\">As we have said earlier in this opinion, September Sturrup testified that approximately one week before Dallas was shot Dallas told Sturrup that the defendant \u201cwas back and [Dallas] felt like [the defendant] was going to get him this time.\u201d Sturrup also testified that Dallas also said, \u201cEither [the defendant\u2019s] going to get me or I\u2019ll have to get him.\u201d In addition, Sturrup testified that a few years before Dallas was shot, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>as Sturrap and Dallas were walking in Orchard Park, Dallas saw the defendant and commented, \u201c[H]ere comes that dude again . . . [d]on\u2019t turn around . . . I\u2019m going to cut through the building and I\u2019ll meet you up on Dudley.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b189-5\">For the most part, these statements went no further than to indicate Dallas\u2019s fear of the defendant. A murder victim\u2019s statement that he feared the defendant, even if made known to the defendant,, sheds no light on whether the defendant had a motive to kill him, and therefore is not admissible in the defendant\u2019s trial for murder. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cyr, ante </em>89, 92-95 (1997); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>30 Mass. App. Ct. 543, 548 (1991), citing <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>DelValle, supra </em>at 492-493; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bond, </em>17 Mass. App. Ct. 396, 399 (1984); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>490 F.2d 758, 765 (D.C. Cir. 1974); McCormick, Evidence \u00a7 296, at 853-854 (3d ed. 1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b189-6\">Dallas\u2019s statement, as testified to by Sturrap, that either the defendant would get him or he would get the defendant, perhaps could be construed not so much as indicating fear but as indicating Dallas\u2019s intention to \u201cget\u201d the defendant. In any event, unless that state of mind was communicated somehow to the defendant, it sheds no light on the defendant\u2019s state of mind, and it is the defendant\u2019s state of mind that is at issue. The principal danger in admitting evidence of a homicide victim\u2019s fear of the defendant or desire to \u201cget\u201d the defendant when there is no evidence of the defendant\u2019s awareness of the victim\u2019s state of mind is that the jury will consider the victim\u2019s statement of fear or intention, standing alone, as somehow reflecting on the defendant\u2019s state of mind rather than that of the victim. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Brown, supra </em>at 766.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-7\">The Commonwealth directs our attention to <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Weichell, </em>390 Mass. 62 (1983), cert, denied, 465 U.S. 1032 (1984), asserting that that case supports its position that Sturrap\u2019s testimony that Dallas Price told her that the defendant \u201cwas back\u201d and that \u201ceither he\u2019s going to get me or I\u2019ll have to get him\u201d was properly admitted because that was \u201cprecisely the state of mind evidence that was properly admitted\u201d in the <em>Weichell </em>case. <em>Weichell </em>does not support the Commonwealth\u2019s position. In <em>Weichell, </em>the court said, \u201cWe consider first whether the evidence of the victim\u2019s state of mind toward the defendant during the ten days prior to the victim\u2019s death <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>should be admitted in the absence of direct evidence that the defendant was even aware of the victim\u2019s hostility toward him. Such evidence is admissible only if the jury could have reasonably inferred that the defendant knew of the victim\u2019s state of mind. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Borodine, supra. </em>We conclude that the jury could so have inferred.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 74. The <em>Weichell </em>court then set forth the evidence that the defendant knew of the victim\u2019s state of mind during the ten days before the victim\u2019s death. There is no comparable evidence in the present case. In this case, Sturrup\u2019s testimony concerning Dallas\u2019s state of mind with respect to the defendant prior to their confrontation at the Biarritz Lounge was irrelevant because there was no evidence that the defendant was aware of it.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-5\">We reach the same result with respect to Leroyal Holmes\u2019s testimony that, in the Biarritz Lounge on the night of the shooting, Dallas stated that his \u201cworst enemy was in the bar.\u201d There was no evidence that Dallas\u2019s state of mind as reflected by that statement was known to the defendant when the shooting occurred. The evidence should not have been admitted. Also, we are content, as the Commonwealth appears to be, that the evidence concerning Dallas\u2019s state of mind presented through the testimony of Edie Price and Marie Fletcher should not have been admitted. Their testimony was admitted only to establish Dallas\u2019s state of mind \u2014 his fear \u2014 and under the <em>DelValle, supra, </em>line of cases was inadmissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-6\">Having concluded that the state of mind evidence we have been discussing should not have been admitted, the question before us is whether \u201cthe error[s] possibly weakened [the defendant\u2019s] case in some significant way so as to require a new trial.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Schulze, </em>389 Mass. 735, 741 (1983). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Daggett, </em>416 Mass. 347, 352 n.5 (1993). The critical question is whether the court fairly can say that \u201cthe jury could not have been influenced by the [erroneously admitted evidence].\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Stone, </em>321 Mass. 471, 474 (1947).</p>\n<p id=\"b190-7\">The only disputed issue at the trial was the identity of the gunman. An important consideration would be whether the defendant had a reason \u2014 a motive \u2014 to kill either Dallas or Tony. In his limiting instructions to the jury concerning the four witnesses\u2019 testimony as to what Dallas had told them, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>the judge instructed the jury that the witnesses were permitted to testify as to what Dallas had told- them \u201cfor a very limited purpose: one, as evidence of possible motive in the case . . . and also as evidence of the state of mind of [Dallas].\u201d We cannot, therefore, be confident that the jury did not conclude, in part at least from the inadmissible evidence, that the defendant had a motive to kill Dallas and, as a result, fired into the rear seat of the Geo Tracker where Dallas and Tony Price were located.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-5\">The Commonwealth relied principally on identifications of the defendant by Holmes, Buford, and Monroe, who testified that they were familiar with the defendant. However, the credibility of these witnesses was impeached by the evidence of the witnesses\u2019 prior convictions, the existence of outstanding warrants against them at the time of the murders, and felony charges against them at the time of their testimony. Holmes had been previously convicted of carrying a firearm without a license, unlawful possession of ammunition, possession of cocaine with intent to distribute, unlawful possession of marihuana, distribution of marihuana, and conspiracy to violate the drug laws. At the time of trial, Holmes was awaiting prosecution on charges of distribution of cocaine and receiving a stolen motor vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-6\">Buford had been previously convicted on two separate occasions of possession of cocaine with intent to distribute, distribution of cocaine, unlawful possession of a firearm, and conspiracy to violate the drug laws. At the time of trial, Buford stood charged with unlawful possession of a firearm, and at least two offenses related to the possession of illegal drugs with intent to distribute.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-7\">Monroe had been previously convicted of conspiracy to violate the drug laws. At the time of trial, Monroe faced pending charges of assault and battery by means of a dangerous weapon, threats, and possession of a stolen motor vehicle. There was no physical or scientific evidence that decisively resolved the question of the killer\u2019s identity.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-8\">The defendant presented statements made by Tony Price to two police officers as he was dying from the gunman\u2019s bullets (dying declarations) that \u201cJunior [Williams] did it.\u201d There was evidence that Dallas Price and Williams had a confrontation at the Biarritz Lounge earlier on the evening of the murders. It was also undisputed that it was Williams\u2019s Ford <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>Escort that turned down Palmer Street and from which, moments later, the gunman emerged.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-5\">\"In this context, it seems clear that the Commonwealth\u2019s case against the defendant may have been significantly enhanced by the introduction of statements made by one of the victims in the hours, days, and weeks prior to the murders expressing fear that the defendant was going to kill him. Dallas\u2019s statements that he was afraid that the defendant would kill him could have been seen by the jury as \u201ca prophecy of what might happen to him,\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Day, </em>591 F.2d 861, 883 (D.C. Cir. 1978). His statements of fear were certainly \u201ca voice from the grave casting an incriminating shadow on the defendant.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>490 F.2d 758, 781 (D.C. Cir. 1974). The inadmissible testimony may very well have \u201cfulfilled the broad purpose of proving that threats on the deceased\u2019s life were made by the defendant[], and the jury were left to infer from this that the defendants desired his death and, in fact, accomplished it.\u201d <em>DelValle, supra </em>at 492-493.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-6\">In a case quite similar to this one, <em>United States </em>v. <em>Brown, supra </em>at 762, the court considered the prejudicial effect, in a prosecution for murder, of an improperly admitted statement made by the victim to his wife prior to his death that he was frightened that the defendant would kill him. The court concluded that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b192-7\">\u201cclearly a palpable danger exists that the jury will infer from the statement of [the victim\u2019s wife] . . . that [the victim] stated T am afraid I will be killed by [the defendant],\u2019 that [the defendant] was a man capable of murder, that he had done things in the past to [the victim] to justify this fear, or that [the defendant] had explicitly threatened [the victim\u2019s] life in the past. Any or all of the above conclusions are inevitably present in the jury\u2019s collective mind. Yet all such inferences insofar as they may' reflect on defendant\u2019s intentions or past conduct would be improperly drawn. Moreover, the statement is extremely closely related to the issues at hand. The defendant here directly placed his identity in issue, and the challenged testimony expressly names him as the probable murderer. To the jury it must have been as simple as this: [the victim] feared being killed by [the defen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>dant], and sure enough [the victim] was killed. Therefore, odds are good that it was done by [the defendant]. Thus the danger that the statement in question would be misused by the jury on the disputed issue of identity is extremely high.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b193-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 778-779.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-6\">In addition to eliciting Dallas\u2019s statements from the Commonwealth\u2019s witnesses, the prosecutor referred to these statements in both her opening and closing arguments. In her closing, the prosecutor told the jury that they \u201chad more than identification in this case. You have evidence of motive,\u201d and then recounted the testimony concerning Dallas\u2019s statements of fear of the defendant. In this case, \u201c \u2018we cannot say that the evidence and the prosecutor\u2019s [use of it in her] argument did not have the effect the Commonwealth intended it to have.\u2019 <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Reed, </em>397 Mass. 440, 443 (1986).\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rosa, </em>412 Mass. 147, 158 (1992), <em>S.C., </em>422 Mass. 18 (1996). A new trial therefore is required.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-7\">The judgments are reversed, and the verdicts are set aside. The cases are remanded to the Superior Court for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-8\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
