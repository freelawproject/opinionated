For the reasons that follow, we reverse and remand for further proceedings consistent with this decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   {\u00b6 2} On March 13, 2016, Sieminski's grandmother called 9-1-1 because she believed Sieminski had overdosed. Medical personnel administered NARCAN and transported Sieminski to the hospital for further treatment. While Sieminski was receiving treatment, deputies from the Lorain County Sheriff's Department discovered contraband during a search of the home.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 3} The Lorain County Grand Jury subsequently indicted Sieminski on the following charges: (I) possession of drugs in violation of R.C. 2925.11(A), a felony of the fifth degree; (II) possessing drug abuse instruments in violation of R.C. 2925.12(A), a misdemeanor of the second degree; and (III) using or possessing with the intent to use drug paraphernalia in violation of R.C. 2925.14(C)(1), a misdemeanor of the fourth degree. Sieminski pleaded not guilty and the matter proceeded through the pretrial process.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 4} On October 24, 2016, Sieminski filed a motion to dismiss the charges in the indictment, alleging that she was entitled to immunity pursuant to R.C. 2925.11(B)(2)(b). The State filed a brief in opposition to the motion to dismiss. Based upon the briefs filed by the parties, the trial court concluded that the immunity provided pursuant to R.C. 2925.11(B)(2)(b) applied in this case and granted Sieminski's motion to dismiss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 5} The State filed this timely appeal, raising four assignments of error for our review. For ease of analysis, we elect to consider the assignments of error out of order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Assignment of Error II\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    The trial court erred when it granted Ms. Sieminski's motion to dismiss as it incorrectly found that the R.C. 2925.11(B)(2)(b) immunity is applicable to defendants who committed a minor possession of drugs offense prior to the amendment's enactment.\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   {\u00b6 6} In its second assignment of error, the State argues that the trial court erred when it determined that the immunity provided in R.C. 2925.11(B)(2)(b) applied to defendants who committed a minor drug offense prior to the amendment's enactment.
