For the following reasons, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Facts and Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b6 2} ECOT, in operation since 2000, is an online or \"e-school\" in which students do not attend traditional, brick-and-mortar buildings, but instead attend classes through a computer by logging in to ECOT's online platform to access educational curriculum. Students enrolled in ECOT also have access to other non-computer educational opportunities, including field trips.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {\u00b6 3} Pursuant to R.C. 3314.01(B), ECOT is considered a \"community school,\" which is \"a public school, independent of any school district, and is part of the state's program of education.\" As a public school, a community school such as ECOT receives funding from the state of Ohio based on the number of full-time equivalent (\"FTE\") students enrolled in the community school. R.C. 3314.08(C). The community schools self-report the number of FTE students to ODE through the education management information system (\"EMIS\"). ODE then has the right to \"adjust\" the payment to the community school \"to reflect any enrollment of students in community schools for less than the equivalent of a full school year.\" R.C. 3314.08(H).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   {\u00b6 4} ODE performs periodic FTE reviews of community schools to investigate whether a funding adjustment is warranted in a given year. Such a review involves ODE personnel visiting the community school and identifying the records ODE would like to view in order to confirm the school's reported FTE numbers for the previous academic year. If, through the review, ODE discovers it owes additional funding to the community school, ODE has 30 days to provide the additional funding. However, if the review results in a finding that the community school cannot substantiate the number of FTE students for which it received funding, ODE can reduce the school's funding amount. The reduction, or \"clawback,\" occurs on a going-forward basis by reducing, over an extended period of time, future state dollars paid to the community school. (Sept. 13, 2016 Tr. Vol. II at 179-80.) A community school that disagrees with ODE's initial determination on funding has a right to an administrative appeal to the State Board of Education. R.C. 3314.08(K)(2). The State Board of Education's decision on the appeal is the agency's final determination on the appropriate funding for the community school for the given academic year. R.C. 3314.08(K)(2)(d).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   {\u00b6 5} ODE has performed FTE reviews of ECOT in 2001, 2002, 2003, 2005, 2006, 2011, and, most recently, in 2016. ODE typically conducts reviews of community schools every five years, though it will sometimes conduct a follow-up FTE review the next year if a significant discrepancy appears.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   {\u00b6 6} Following ODE's 2001 FTE review, ODE and ECOT began discussing how to document student attendance and participation for the 2002-2003 FTE review. The parties engaged in negotiations on a funding agreement, and there were several discussions about whether the funding agreement was to apply only to the 2002-2003 academic year or whether it would apply for the 2002-2003 academic year and thereafter. The final funding agreement entered in January 2003 is silent as to duration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   {\u00b6 7} In the 2015-2016 academic year, ECOT claimed a right to state funding for\n   more than 15,000 FTE students, resulting in more than $100 million in state educational funds. ECOT learned in January 2016 that it would be subject to an FTE review for the 2015-2016 academic year. John Wilhelm, the ODE area coordinator, sent ECOT a letter listing the types of records he would be requesting from ECOT in connection with the review. Wilhelm made clear in the letter that ODE would be requesting durational records showing how long or how often students had accessed learning opportunities over the course of the academic year. In its prior FTE reviews of ECOT, ODE had not requested such so-called \"durational data.\" (Sept. 19, 2016 Tr. Vol. IV at 249, 255.).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   {\u00b6 8} ODE publishes its FTE review manual on its website. In January 2016, ODE published the new 2016 FTE review manual, intending it to be used in connection with its 2016 reviews. This manual contained additional information regarding durational data for e-school FTE reviews beyond what the 2015 FTE review manual contained. ECOT and other e-schools expressed concern to ODE about the appropriateness of using an FTE review manual that had first been published midway through the academic year. Thus, ODE agreed that it would use the 2015 FTE review manual for its 2016 FTE reviews.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   {\u00b6 9} From March 28 to March 30, 2016, ODE conducted its initial FTE review of ECOT, using the files ECOT provided of 750 students that ODE had identified in advance of the preliminary review, including durational data. Each of the 750 student files included a report showing log-on and log-off times for the specified student. Those reports showed that, on average, students spent only about one hour per day logged on to ECOT's online educational platform.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   {\u00b6 10} Disputing the appropriateness of the use of durational data in the FTE review, ECOT asserted the information provided was only a sample printout from its learning management system and was intended merely as an example of the type of form that ECOT might be able to prepare in the future should ODE eventually require durational data as part of its review. Brittny Pierson, the deputy superintendent and chief of staff for ECOT, testified she made it clear to Wilhelm that the durational reports did not present accurate information related to the students' participation and was instead a potential format for future consideration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   {\u00b6 11} ODE was set to conduct the final 2016 year-end FTE review of ECOT in July 2016, and ODE determined its area coordinators should again review durational data as part of the final review. However, ECOT did not provide durational data to ODE at the year-end review, asserting it did not keep track of this type of data as ODE had never before requested such data.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   {\u00b6 12} On July 8, 2016, three days before the final 2016 FTE review was scheduled to begin, ECOT filed a complaint against ODE seeking specific performance, declaratory and injunctive relief, asking the trial court to block ODE from obtaining and considering durational data during the FTE review. ECOT alleged violations of R.C. 3314.08, of R.C. Chapter 119's rulemaking process, and a breach of the 2002-2003 funding agreement. That same day, ECOT filed a motion for a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction against ODE. The trial court denied the temporary restraining order on July 11, 2016. Subsequently, on August 1, 2016, ECOT filed its first amended complaint for specific performance of the funding agreement, asserting a violation of R.C. 3314.08(H)(3), and for declaratory and injunctive relief. ECOT also added the ECOT Families as additional plaintiffs, asserting\n   ODE's FTE review violated the ECOT Families' equal protection rights. On August 22, 2016, the ECOT Families filed a motion for a preliminary injunction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   {\u00b6 13} Meanwhile, on July 20, 2016, ODE served discovery on ECOT, including requests for the durational data that ECOT had refused to provide during the final three-day review of the 2015-2016 academic year. Following ODE's July 23, 2016 motion to compel discovery, which the trial court granted, ECOT provided ODE with the durational data that ODE sought, allowing ODE to perform a durational review of ECOT's reported FTE.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   {\u00b6 14} The trial court conducted a six-day hearing, beginning on September 12, 2016, on ECOT's claims that (1) ECOT is entitled to specific performance of the funding agreement; (2) ODE violated R.C. 3314.08(H)(3) by stating its intent to evaluate ECOT's FTE funding based on the amount of time a student is logged in to ECOT's educational platform, seeking declaratory and injunctive relief preventing ODE from evaluating and/or calculating e-school FTE funding based on anything other than \"offered\" learning opportunities; (3) the funding agreement is valid and enforceable, and it precludes ODE from imposing a durational requirement as part of the FTE funding process; (4) any durational requirements contained in the FTE review manuals are unlawful because they are administrative rules that ODE did not promulgate in accordance with Chapter 119 of the Revised Code; and (5) ODE's FTE review of ECOT was a purposeful effort to single out the ECOT Families for disparate treatment related to public school choice in violation of the ECOT Families' equal protection rights.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   {\u00b6 15} After post-hearing briefing, the trial court, in a September 30, 2016 decision and entry, denied ECOT's motion for preliminary injunction and the ECOT Families' motion for preliminary injunction, determining the plaintiffs failed to demonstrate a substantial likelihood of success on the merits of any of their claims. ECOT and the ECOT Families appealed that ruling to this court, but this court dismissed the appeals for lack of a final appealable order.\n   <em>\n    Electronic Classroom of Tomorrow v. Ohio Dept. of Edn.\n   </em>\n   , 10th Dist. No. 16AP-692 (Nov. 22, 2016) (judgment entry).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   {\u00b6 16} Following dismissal of the appeal, the parties stipulated in the trial court that the preliminary injunction hearing be deemed a final trial on the merits. The trial court then issued a final decision and judgment on December 14, 2016, concluding (1) the funding agreement did not apply to the 2015-2016 FTE review and, thus, ODE was not in breach of the funding agreement when it performed the 2015-2016 FTE review; (2) ODE did not violate R.C. 3314.08(H)(3) by requesting and reviewing durational data; (3) the FTE review manual is not an invalid administrative rule; and (4) ODE did not violate the equal protection rights of the ECOT Families. Accordingly, the trial court determined ODE was entitled to judgment in its favor on all of ECOT's claims as a matter of law. ECOT and the ECOT Families both timely appeal, and this court consolidated the appeals for purposes of record filing, briefing, and oral argument.\n   <em>\n    Electronic Classroom of Tomorrow v. Ohio Dept. of Edn.\n   </em>\n   , 10th Dist. No. 16AP-863 (Jan. 10, 2017) (journal entry).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

ECOT's Second Assignment of Error-The Funding Statute\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   {\u00b6 19} In its second assignment of error, ECOT argues the trial court erred when it concluded ODE was not in violation of R.C. 3314.08. More specifically, ECOT asserts the trial court erroneously interpreted R.C. 3314.08, the funding statute related to community schools, to allow ODE to consider durational data in making its FTE determinations. ECOT asserts the language of the funding statute requires ODE to provide funding based only on whether ECOT offered learning opportunities to a student regardless of whether the student accessed, or participated in, such learning opportunities.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   {\u00b6 20} Statutory interpretation is a question of law subject to de novo review.\n   <em>\n    State v.

As pertinent here, R.C. 3314.08(H)(3) provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   The department shall determine each community school student's percentage of full-time equivalency\n   <em>\n    based on the percentage of learning opportunities offered by the community school to that student\n   </em>\n   , reported either as number of hours or number of days, is of the total learning opportunities offered by the community school to a student who attends for the school's entire school year.\n   <em>\n    However, no internet- or computer-based community school shall be credited for any time a student spends participating in learning opportunities beyond ten hours within any period of twenty-four consecutive hours.\n   </em>\n   Whether it reports hours or days of learning opportunities, each community school shall offer not less than nine hundred twenty hours of learning opportunities during the school year.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   (Emphasis added.) ECOT looks to the first sentence of R.C. 3314.08(H)(3) and asserts the use of the word \"offered\" in conjunction with the term \"learning opportunities\" must mean that a community school need only show it offered a student learning opportunities without regard to the student's participation in such learning opportunities in order to receive FTE funding. However, a plain reading of the statute defies ECOT's interpretation of the funding statute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   {\u00b6 23} As the trial court noted in its decision, the very next sentence of R.C. 3314.08(H)(3) states \"no internet- or computer-based community school shall be credited for any time a student spends\n   <em>\n    participating\n   </em>\n   in learning opportunities beyond ten hours within any period of twenty-four consecutive hours.\" (Emphasis added.) Were we to agree with ECOT that the term \"learning opportunities\" has no durational component and the term \"offered\" means only \"made available\" regardless of whether the student accepted or participated in any learning opportunity, we would render meaningless this second sentence of R.C. 3314.08(H)(3).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Wilson\n   </em>\n   at 336,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=673%20N.E.2d%201347\">\n    673 N.E.2d 1347\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a court shall not pick out and disassociate one sentence from the context of the whole statute). Instead, by stating in the second sentence of R.C. 3314.08(H)(3) that a community school will\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   be credited for participation beyond ten hours per day, the General Assembly must mean that a community school\n   <em>\n    will\n   </em>\n   be credited for participation less than or equal to ten hours per day. Stated another way, the duration of a student's participation is essential to determining whether a student has been \"offered,\" or supplied with, learning opportunities for purposes of calculating FTE.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   {\u00b6 24} We also note that the phrase \"learning opportunities\" appears in the immediately preceding subsection of the funding statute, R.C. 3314.08(H)(2), which states, in relevant part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   For purposes of applying this division and divisions (H)(3) and (4) of this section to a community school student, \"learning opportunities\" shall be defined in the contract, which shall describe both classroom-based and non-classroom-based learning opportunities and\n   <em>\n    shall be in compliance with criteria and\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    documentation requirements for student participation which shall be established by [ODE]\n   </em>\n   .\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   (Emphasis added.) Thus, the General Assembly specifically contemplated student participation, not just the offering of an educational opportunity, in determining a student's FTE status. It is notable that R.C. 3314.08(H)(2) references R.C. 3314.08(H)(3), and vice versa. Reading these subsections in pari materia, it would be inconsistent to define \"learning opportunities\" as a measure of student participation in one subsection of the statute but to apply a definition of \"learning opportunities\" that only requires simple enrollment in the very next subsection.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   {\u00b6 25} R.C. 3314.08(H)(3) also provides a formula for calculating a student's FTE status. Pursuant to the statute, the academic year for a community school must consist of a minimum of 920 hours. R.C. 3314.08(H) then directs that a student's FTE status is a fraction determined by the number of hours supplied to a student over the total number of hours in the school's academic year. Were we to agree with ECOT's interpretation of the funding statute, the calculation method outlined in R.C. 3314.08(H)(3) would be wholly unnecessary as every enrolled student technically would be \"offered\" the minimum 920 hours of learning opportunities, regardless of whether a specific student actually participated in any of those hours. Such an interpretation would render this subsection meaningless. Instead, we agree with ODE that a plain reading of the statute compels the conclusion that although enrollment is a necessary predicate to funding, the amount of funding per student is dependent on a measure of student participation. Thus, we agree with the trial court that ODE did not violate R.C. 3314.08(H)(3) when it requested and reviewed durational data of ECOT students.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   {\u00b6 26} We overrule ECOT's second assignment of error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.

We agree with the trial court, however, that the state has a legitimate government interest in conducting FTE reviews of community schools that receive state funding to ensure those schools are entitled to the funds they claim. Moreover, although the ECOT Families assert ODE had \"no explanation\" for its decision to conduct an FTE review of ECOT in 2015-2016 and rely on durational data in doing so, the record indicates that ODE had a practice of having a standard review cycle of five years for FTE reviews. ECOT's last FTE review was in 2011, so the 2015-2016\n   FTE review aligned with the five-year review cycle. That other e-schools in Ohio were not on the path for a five-year review in 2015-2016 does not render ODE's FTE review of ECOT in 2015-2016 lacking in a reasonable relationship to the implementation of ODE's legitimate government interest in protecting public funds. Thus, we additionally agree with the trial court that ODE's practice of a five-year review cycle constitutes a rational basis for ODE's 2015-2016 FTE review of ECOT.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   {\u00b6 47} Because ODE had a rational basis to conduct the 2015-2016 FTE review of ECOT, the trial court did not err in concluding the ECOT Families' equal protection claim fails.

Disposition\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   {\u00b6 48} Based on the foregoing reasons, the trial court did not err in determining that R.C. 3314.08(H)(3) permitted ODE to consider durational data in its 2015-2016 FTE review of ECOT, that ODE did not violate its R.C. Chapter 119 rulemaking authority, that the 2002-2003 funding agreement did not apply to ODE's 2015-2016 FTE review of ECOT, that ECOT was not entitled to preliminary or permanent injunctive relief, and that the ECOT Families did not establish a valid equal protection claim. Having overruled ECOT's five assignments of error and the ECOT Families' sole assignment of error, we affirm the judgment of the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   <em>\n    Judgment affirmed.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   TYACK, P.J., and DORRIAN, J., concur.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-98\">\n    ECOT additionally argues that R.C. 3301.13 imposes a more stringent requirement on ODE to use the processes described in R.C. Chapter 119 when performing any action to prescribe minimum standards. In pertinent part, R.C. 3301.13 states \"[i]n the exercise of any of its functions or powers, including the power to make rules and regulations and to prescribe minimum standards the department of education, and any officer or agency therein, shall be subject to Chapter 119. of the Revised Code.\" This language, however, merely confirms that ODE is a state agency subject to the rulemaking requirements of R.C. Chapter 119 when appropriate. It does not, as ECOT argues, require ODE to make a \"rule\" every time ODE acts. Because R.C. 3301.13 specifically directs that ODE is subject to R.C. Chapter 119 rulemaking, we analyze this argument under R.C. Chapter 119.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
