It is unclear from the record if he appealed. Upon his release from prison, Mr. Saturday was placed on five years of mandatory post-release control.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 3} While on post-release control, Mr. Saturday was convicted in the Summit County Court of Common Pleas of identity fraud against a disabled person and telecommunications harassment. He was sentenced to two years in prison for identity fraud to be served concurrently with 180 days in jail for telecommunications harassment. He also received an additional, consecutive judicial sanction sentence of 1,215 days in prison for violating his Ashtabula County post-release control. Mr. Saturday appealed to this Court and the matter was reversed and remanded for the limited purpose of allowing him the opportunity to seek a waiver of court costs.\n   <em>\n    State v.

The State does not dispute that Mr. Saturday has since served his sentences for identity fraud against a disabled person and telecommunications harassment, and he is currently incarcerated solely on the 1,215-day judicial sanction sentence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 4} Mr. Saturday filed a motion to vacate judicial sanction sentence in his Summit County case claiming that post-release control was improperly ordered in his Ashtabula County case and, thus, his Ashtabula County post-release control and his Summit County judicial sanction sentence were both void. The trial court denied the motion (1) as an untimely petition for post-conviction relief, and alternatively (2) because Mr. Saturday was notified of the consequences for violating post-release control in a \"Notice (Prison Imposed)\" form that was incorporated into his Ashtabula County sentencing entry and signed by both Mr. Saturday and his attorney.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 5} Mr. Saturday now appeals from the trial court's order denying his motion to vacate judicial sanction sentence and raises two assignments of error for this Court's review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 6} For ease of analysis, we rearrange and consolidate Mr. Saturday's assignments of error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR TWO\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   THE TRIAL COURT ERRED WHEN IT DENIED NICHOLAS SATURDAY'S MOTION TO VACATE HIS VOID JUDICIAL[ ]SANCTION SENTENCE BASED ON POST[-]RELEASE CONTROL FROM ASHTABULA COUNTY CASE NO. 12-CR-035 WHEN THE SENTENCING ENTRY OMITTED THE POTENTIAL CONSEQUENCES\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   OF POST[-]RELEASE CONTROL VIOLATIONS.

The Supreme Court of Ohio has stated that \"a trial court must provide statutorily compliant notification to a defendant regarding post[-]release control at the time of sentencing, including notifying the defendant of the details of the post[-]release control and the consequences of violating post[-]release control.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

If a sentence is void for failure to include proper post[-]release[ ]control notification, the trial court-or the reviewing court-has an obligation to recognize the void sentence, vacate it, and order resentencing. * * * Further, a trial court, confronted with an untimely or successive petition for post[ ]conviction relief that challenges a sentence that is void, must ignore the procedural irregularities of the petition and vacate the void sentence and resentence the defendant.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=906%20N.E.2d%20422\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   However, Mr. Saturday's reliance on\n   <em>\n    Holcomb\n   </em>\n   is misplaced. In\n   <em>\n    Holcomb\n   </em>\n   , we were reviewing an order from the Summit County Court of Common Pleas, not an order from a trial court in another appellate district's jurisdiction, as Mr. Saturday urges us to do here.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 22. We have already concluded above that we decline to overstep the bounds of this Court's jurisdiction and review judgment entries from other jurisdictions to determine voidness. Furthermore, Mr. Holcomb was never advised of post-release control at all in his case, so there could be no question that his post-release control was void.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 21. Again, there is nothing in the record before us to show that Mr. Saturday's Ashtabula County post-release control has ever been found void by a court with jurisdiction to make such a finding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   {\u00b6 19} Less than two years after\n   <em>\n    Holcomb\n   </em>\n   , we disagreed with an argument before us that a trial court erred in construing a revised motion to vacate a void judgment as a petition for post-conviction relief.\n   <em>\n    State v.

Summit No. 25448,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2011-Ohio-913\">\n    2011-Ohio-913\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2011%20WL%20721311\">\n    2011 WL 721311\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 10, \u00b6 12. Mr. Childs relied on this Court's post-release control case law, including\n   <em>\n    Holcomb\n   </em>\n   , and argued that his claims were not untimely and he could raise his arguments, regardless of procedural formalities, because his judgment was void.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 12. We stated: \"Apart from the fact that much of this Court's post-release control precedent has been largely eviscerated by [\n   <em>\n    Fischer\n   </em>\n   ], we are not convinced that R.C. 2953.23(A)'s requirements and res judicata are inapplicable here.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \"As such, we are unwilling to extend any pre-\n   <em>\n    Fischer\n   </em>\n   law and conclude that Childs' petition was immune from procedural formalities and substantive rules of law, such as res judicata.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   {\u00b6 20} Because there is no evidence that Mr. Saturday's Ashtabula County post-release control has ever been found to be void, we conclude that the Summit County Court of Common Pleas did not err when it reclassified his motion to vacate judicial sanction sentence as a petition for post-conviction relief.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

R.C. 2953.23(A)(1)(a). He must further show \"by clear and convincing evidence that, but for constitutional error at trial, no reasonable factfinder would have found the petitioner guilty of the offense of which [he] was convicted\" or, \"if the claim challenges a sentence of death that, but for constitutional error at the sentencing hearing, no reasonable factfinder would have found the petitioner eligible for the death sentence.\" R.C. 2953.23(A)(1)(b).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   {\u00b6 23} Mr. Saturday appealed his sentence in his Summit County case and the transcript was filed in this Court on December 3, 2014. He filed his motion to vacate judicial sanction sentence in the trial court on June 6, 2016, which is beyond the timeframe provided for in R.C. 2953.21(A)(2). Mr. Saturday has failed to satisfy the requirements under R.C. 2953.23(A)(1) for the trial court to entertain his untimely petition. Therefore, we conclude that the trial court did not have statutory authority to consider the merits of the motion and correctly denied it.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.
