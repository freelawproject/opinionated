Schwartz\n   </em>\n   , this Court recognized a new cause of action permitting parents to recover the extraordinary expenses incurred to care for a disabled infant who, but for a physician's negligent failure to detect or advise on the risks of impairment, would not have been born (\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2339125\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny2d/46/401/#p410\">\n    46 N.Y.2d 401\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 410,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=413%20N.Y.S.2d%20895\">\n    413 N.Y.S.2d 895\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=386%20N.E.2d%20807\">\n    386 N.E.2d 807\n   </extracted-citation>\n   [1978] ). The issue in these related appeals is whether the statute of limitations for such an extraordinary expenses claim runs from the date of the alleged negligence or the date of birth. We hold that it is the latter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <em>\n    I.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The salient allegations in both cases, which we must assume to be true in light of their procedural posture, are the same. Two couples-the Dennehys and the Farbers-sought in vitro fertilization (IVF) treatment from defendant Dr. Alan Copperman at defendant Reproductive Medicine Associates of New York, LLP (RMA). The couple discussed the possibility of using an egg donor. Copperman informed each couple that RMA screened donor candidates for all known genetic conditions for which testing is available, but did not state which conditions were included in the screening. The couple then matched with an anonymous egg donor and, after consenting to the IVF procedure, the plaintiff mother was implanted with fertilized embryos using the donor eggs. Pregnancy was confirmed and the couple was discharged to their obstetrician/gynecologist. Each plaintiff mother later gave birth without complications-the Dennehys had a single infant and the Farbers had twins. Following birth, Copperman learned that the egg donor had tested positive for the fragile X trait, a chromosomal abnormality that can result in intellectual disability and other deficits. He informed the couples within one year of the births, and testing later confirmed that the Dennehys' infant and one of the Farbers' twins had the full fragile X mutation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The parents commenced separate lawsuits against Copperman and RMA.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   As\n   relevant here, the complaints allege, in essence, that defendants failed to timely screen the egg donor for the fragile X mutation or to notify plaintiffs that they did not screen for this trait. The parents contend these negligent acts\n   or omissions caused them to consent to the IVF procedure and go forward with pregnancy, resulting in the parents incurring extraordinary expenses to care for and treat a child with a disability. Defendants moved to dismiss both complaints under CPLR 3211(a)(5) and (a)(7), contending, among other things, that the extraordinary expenses claim is time-barred by CPLR 214-a, which provides that a 2 \u00bd-year statute of limitations for medical malpractice claims runs from \"the act, omission or failure complained of or last treatment where there is continuous treatment for the same illness, injury or condition which gave rise to the said act, omission or failure\" ( CPLR 214-a ). Defendants argued that the limitations period runs from the date of the alleged malpractice, which they identified as the date the embryo was implanted in the mother. Plaintiffs opposed the motions to dismiss, contending that the limitations period started on the date of birth. It is undisputed that if the statute of limitations runs from the date of malpractice, even assuming the continuous treatment toll extended the date to plaintiffs' discharge to their obstetrician/gynecologist, the cause of action would be time-barred.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In each case, Supreme Court, among other things, denied the motion to dismiss with respect to the extraordinary expenses claim. The court held that the statute of limitations began to run upon the infant's birth, which rendered both actions timely. The Appellate Division affirmed, insofar as relevant here (\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4103599\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ad3d/136/73/\">\n    136 A.D.3d 73\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4103599\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ad3d/136/73/\">\n    22 N.Y.S.3d 190\n   </extracted-citation>\n   [1st Dept.2015] ;\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4362203,4364396\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ad3d/134/543/\">\n    134 A.D.3d 543\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4364396,4366717\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nys3d/20/885/\">\n    20 N.Y.S.3d 885\n   </extracted-citation>\n   [1st Dept.2015] ), and thereafter granted defendants leave to appeal, certifying the question whether the orders were properly made.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   We now affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <em>\n    II\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In negligence cases, the statute of limitations generally begins to run when a cause of action accrues (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Aetna Life &amp; Cas.

This comported with the associated common-law rule that a medical malpractice claim accrues on the date of the negligent act or omission.

Following\n   <em>\n    Flanagan\n   </em>\n   , lower courts moved toward adopting a discovery rather than an accrual rule more broadly in medical malpractice cases (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Walton v.

To halt this trend, the legislature enacted CPLR 214-a, which codified the common-law rule, as applied in a case like\n   <em>\n    Goldsmith\n   </em>\n   , that the limitations period for medical malpractice begins to run at the time the cause of action accrues-the date of malpractice. This served to curtail further \"judicial expansiveness towards a more plaintiff friendly\n   <em>\n    discovery\n   </em>\n   rule\" (\n   <em>\n    LaBarbera v.

There is no question that, in the wake of CPLR 214-a and its companions, the legislature has exclusive authority to determine when the discovery rather than the traditional rule should apply (\n   <em>\n    see e.g.\n   </em>\n   CPLR 214-b [agent orange exposure]; CPLR 214-c [toxic torts] ).\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   However, nothing in the legislative history suggests an intent to constrict judicial authority to otherwise define when a cause of action accrues, or to mandate that the limitations period should commence\n   <em>\n    prior\n   </em>\n   to accrual. Following CPLR 214-a, we have continued to hold that the typical medical malpractice cause of action accrues at the time of the malpractice, consistent with the statute (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Massie v.

Indeed, we explained in\n   <em>\n    Massie\n   </em>\n   that CPLR 214-a established that \"[a]n action for medical malpractice must be commenced within two years and six months of the date of accrual,\" citing our common-law precedents to show that a malpractice claim accrues on the date of the alleged malpractice ( 78 N.Y.2d at 519,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"98\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=577%20N.Y.S.2d%20223\">\n    577 N.Y.S.2d 223\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"99\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=583%20N.E.2d%20935\">\n    583 N.E.2d 935\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Yet this is not the typical medical malpractice case.

In\n   <em>\n    LaBello v. Albany Med. Ctr.

This differs from the parents' extraordinary expenses claim at issue here in that in\n   <em>\n    LaBello\n   </em>\n   , the child sought damages for her own injuries and the issue was whether the statute of limitations could begin to run before the injured party-there, the child- was alive and had the capacity to bring suit. We determined that the limitations period started to run at birth rather than at the time of the alleged malpractice, notwithstanding the language of CPLR 214-a (\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4436702\" index=\"109\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny2d/85/701/#p704\">\n    85 N.Y.2d at 704\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4436702\" index=\"110\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny2d/85/701/#p704\">\n    628 N.Y.S.2d 40\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4436702\" index=\"111\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny2d/85/701/#p704\">\n    651 N.E.2d 908\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ). Although distinguishable in some respects,\n   <em>\n    LaBello\n   </em>\n   raised the same concern that \"at the time the alleged malpractice was committed, plaintiff could not have alleged all the elements of the tort in the complaint,\" explaining that the case \"present[ed] one of those interstices between statutory and common-law precedential lines of authority\" (\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4436702\" index=\"112\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny2d/85/701/#p704\">\n    85 N.Y.2d at 706-707\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4436702\" index=\"113\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny2d/85/701/#p704\">\n    628 N.Y.S.2d 40\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4436702\" index=\"114\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny2d/85/701/#p704\">\n    651 N.E.2d 908\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ). Recognizing that \" CPLR 214-a does not encompass and did not contemplate the circumstance at issue,\" we held that this Court must \"fill the gap by traditional interpretation and common-law development and application\" (\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4436702\" index=\"115\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny2d/85/701/#p704\">\n    85 N.Y.2d at 706\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4436702\" index=\"116\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny2d/85/701/#p704\">\n    628 N.Y.S.2d 40\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4436702\" index=\"117\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny2d/85/701/#p704\">\n    651 N.E.2d 908\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ). We then determined that due to the specific circumstances of that action, the statute must be interpreted in a manner that permitted the limitations period to run from the date of birth-i.e., the date the claim accrued-rather than from the malpractice date (\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4436702\" index=\"118\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny2d/85/701/#p704\">\n    85 N.Y.2d at 704\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4436702\" index=\"119\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny2d/85/701/#p704\">\n    628 N.Y.S.2d 40\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4436702\" index=\"120\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny2d/85/701/#p704\">\n    651 N.E.2d 908\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ). Otherwise, the statute of limitations would run before the plaintiffs could bring the suit. In reaching that conclusion in\n   <em>\n    LaBello\n   </em>\n   , we did not adopt a new \"exception\" to CPLR 214-a akin to the discovery rule. Rather, we recognized that CPLR 214-a did \"not encompass\" an unanticipated situation, and\n   concluded that the legislature would not have intended the statute of limitations to begin to run before suit could be brought.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The case before us likewise requires similar interpretive measures. The circumstances here preclude the parents from bringing the lawsuit until the child is born, and thus the statute of limitations must run from the date of birth. This result best harmonizes the unique and unanticipated features of this cause of action with the principles animating CPLR 214-a. Thus, because plaintiffs' causes of action for extraordinary expenses accrued upon the birth of their children, the courts below properly determined that the claims were timely.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Accordingly, in each case, the order of the Appellate Division insofar as appealed from should be affirmed, with costs, and the certified question answered in the affirmative.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   GARCIA, J.(dissenting):\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   CPLR 214-a provides that a medical malpractice action \"must be commenced\" within two-and-a-half years \"of the act, omission or failure complained of\" ( CPLR 214-a ). By its terms, CPLR 214-a's accrual-upon-act-or-omission rule admits of only two exceptions: the \"continuous treatment\" exception and the \"foreign object\" exception (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   CPLR 214-a ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    LaBello v.

Though its interpretation contravenes the statutory language, the majority authorizes this deviation in the context of so-called \"wrongful birth\" actions because of the \"unique features\" associated with those claims (majority op. at 615, 69 N.Y.S.3d at 547, 92 N.E.3d at 770).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   There is no \"unique circumstances\" exception in statutory interpretation.

Given this \"unique feature [ ],\" which purportedly \"preclude[s] the parents from bringing the lawsuit until the child is born,\" the majority concludes that \"the statute of limitations must run from the date of birth\" (majority op. at 615, 619, 69 N.Y.S.3d at 547, 550, 92 N.E.3d at 770, 773).

As an initial matter, this Court has never stated that the \"legally cognizable injury\" in these actions is limited to the \"costs resulting from birth\" (majority op. at 615, 69 N.Y.S.3d at 548, 92 N.E.3d at 771).

Nor does the \"legally cognizable injury\" in these medical malpractice actions arise solely \"as a consequence of the birth\" (majority op. at 616, 69 N.Y.S.3d at 548, 92 N.E.3d at 771). Rather, the injury occurs much sooner; as the majority notes, \"[t]he action's gravamen is that, but for defendants' negligence, the parents would not have\n   <em>\n    conceived\n   </em>\n   ... a child requiring extraordinary expenses\" (majority op. at 615, 69 N.Y.S.3d at 548, 92 N.E.3d at 771 [emphasis added] ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Moreover, the majority's assertion-that a live birth is a prerequisite for plaintiffs' claims-will unfairly and arbitrarily restrict the scope of recoverable damages in these types of medical malpractice actions. Given modern medical technology, parents may discover a child's disability in advance of the child's birth and begin incurring expenses-purchasing specialized equipment, monitors, clothing, etc.-in preparation for the child's arrival. Under the majority's theory, however, these costs are not recoverable solely because they are incurred prior to the child's birth.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Though the majority asserts that its holding does not restrict parents from recovering expenses incurred \"in anticipation of\" the child's arrival (majority op. at 615 and n. 5, 69 N.Y.S.3d at 548 and n. 5, 92 N.E.3d at 771 and n. 5), that suggestion is undermined by the majority's fundamental holding that a parent's \"legally cognizable injury\" does not occur until the child's birth. Of course, under basic tort law principles, a plaintiff cannot recover for damages allegedly incurred\n   <em>\n    prior\n   </em>\n   to sustaining an injury; a plaintiff's harm cannot proximately flow from an event that has not yet occurred (\n   <em>\n    see generally\n   </em>\n   Restatement [Second] of Torts \u00a7 902, Comment\n   <em>\n    a\n   </em>\n   [\"Damages flow from an injury\"];\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ambassador Hotel Co., Ltd. v.

Moreover, even if pre-injury damages were somehow recoverable, the clear implication of\n   the majority's assertion is that a parent who accumulates pre-birth expenses may recover those costs if and only if the child is born alive. As a consequence, a plaintiff-parent could recover pre-birth expenses if the child survives-even for only a minute-but not if the child is stillborn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <em>\n    B.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Even assuming that plaintiffs' claims require a live birth, the majority's theory nonetheless fails because, in enacting CPLR 214-a, the legislature displaced the courts' \"judicial authority\" to implement \"common-law rule[s]\" of accrual (majority op. at 617, 69 N.Y.S.3d at 549, 92 N.E.3d at 772). While courts have the authority to interpret accrual dates \"[a]bsent legislative action to the contrary\" (majority op. at 613, 69 N.Y.S.3d at 546, 92 N.E.3d at 769), courts are not free to disregard a clear statutory prescription.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Contrary to the majority's claim, there is no indication that CPLR 214-a merely \"codified the common-law rule\" without \"constrict[ing] judicial authority to otherwise define when a cause of action accrues\" (majority op. at 617, 69 N.Y.S.3d at 549, 92 N.E.3d at 772). Rather, in enacting CPLR 214-a, the legislature specifically sought to \"constrict[ ] judicial expansiveness towards a more plaintiff friendly ... rule\" ( LaBarbera v.

In other words, since the infant plaintiff lacked the \"cognizable status in a court of law to sue\" until his birth, his statute of limitations did not begin to run until that time (\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4436702\" index=\"191\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny2d/85/701/#p704\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4436702\" index=\"191\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny2d/85/701/#p704\">\n    at 707\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4436702\" index=\"192\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny2d/85/701/#p704\">\n    628 N.Y.S.2d 40\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4436702\" index=\"193\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny2d/85/701/#p704\">\n    651 N.E.2d 908\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   The barrier to suit present in\n   <em>\n    LaBello\n   </em>\n   -the plaintiff's non-existence-is entirely inapplicable in this case. Here, plaintiffs are\n   parents seeking damages in their own right, who had the requisite capacity to sue on the date of the alleged malpractice. Unlike an unborn infant, these plaintiffs had the \"recognized legal capacity to sue\" prior to the birth of their children (\n   <em>\n    LaBello,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4436702\" index=\"194\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny2d/85/701/#p704\">\n    85 N.Y.2d at 706\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4436702\" index=\"195\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny2d/85/701/#p704\">\n    628 N.Y.S.2d 40\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4436702\" index=\"196\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny2d/85/701/#p704\">\n    651 N.E.2d 908\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ). Because of this critical distinction, which formed the basis of\n   <em>\n    LaBello's\n   </em>\n   holding,\n   <em>\n    LaBello\n   </em>\n   is entirely inapt.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   <em>\n    V.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   The majority's goal is a laudable one: it allows more time for plaintiffs asserting claims due to alleged medical malpractice resulting in devastating and life-altering injuries to their minor children. But this well-intentioned effort contravenes the plain language of CPLR 214-a and implements an arbitrary \"date of\n   birth\" accrual rule that does not correspond to the date of the alleged injury, the date of plaintiff's capacity to sue, or the date of the injury's discovery. Accordingly, while the majority's holding saves these plaintiffs' claims, it will not save others.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   The governing statute explicitly provides that plaintiffs' limitations period runs from the date of the alleged malpractice, not the date of the child's birth.
