In these consolidated appeals, he claims that following a jury trial, the jury returned inconsistent verdicts on two offenses of operating a vehicle under the influence of alcohol (\"OVI\") pursuant to R.C. 4511.19(A), and that the state failed to present evidence to establish that Harris had had a prior OVI conviction within 20 years-an element of one of the two OVI offenses. Because the two OVI charges were decided independently and separately, and one conviction was not dependent upon a finding of guilt on the other charge, and because Harris had entered into a stipulation as to his prior OVI conviction, we affirm the trial court's judgment in the appeal numbered C-160279. Because Harris abandoned his two other appeals, we dismiss them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     I. The Traffic Stop and Jury Trial\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   {\u00b6 2} Officer Thomas Shreve, a Montgomery, Ohio police officer, observed a motor vehicle operated by Harris in the left-turn-only lane at the interchange of Ronald Reagan Highway and Interstate 71 northbound. Instead of turning left, however, Harris' vehicle proceeded straight through the interchange and turned onto the southbound Interstate 71 ramp. Officer Shreve stopped the vehicle.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 3} Officer Shreve approached the vehicle and detected the odor of alcohol coming from inside the vehicle. Harris told the officer that his driver's license was suspended and that he and his passenger had just left a local tavern where Harris had consumed two beers. Officer Shreve had Harris step from the vehicle. He smelled alcohol on Harris' person and observed that his eyes were bloodshot. When the officer asked Harris to submit to a field sobriety test, Harris declined. Harris explained, \"I've been there before. You can see it on my jacket that I've been there on the DUI's [sic] and all that. I understand how it goes.\" Officer Shreve then placed Harris under arrest for operating his vehicle under the influence of alcohol. At the police station, Harris also refused to submit to a breathalyzer test of his blood alcohol level.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 4} Officer Shreve issued a uniform traffic ticket charging Harris with four offenses: driving under a suspended license, disobeying a traffic control device, and two OVI charges. Because Harris had operated a motor vehicle under the influence of alcohol, had had a prior OVI conviction in 2015, and had refused to submit to a chemical test of his blood alcohol level, he was charged, in the case numbered C-15TRC-31149A, with operating a motor vehicle under the influence of alcohol, in violation of R.C. 4511.19(A)(2). In the case numbered C-15TRC-31149B, Harris was charged with operating a motor vehicle under the influence of alcohol in violation of R.C. 4511.19(A)(1)(a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 5} Harris entered pleas of not guilty to the two OVI offenses and the cases proceeded to a jury trial in Hamilton County Municipal Court. At the beginning of the trial, the state offered a certified copy of Harris' prior OVI conviction and Harris did not contest its use. Officer Shreve testified about the traffic stop and Harris' refusal to submit to the breathalyzer test. Without objection, the trial court instructed the jury that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   The defendant is charged with two separate and distinct offenses. You must consider each offense and the evidence applicable to each offense separately and you must state your verdict as to each * * * offense uninfluenced by your verdict as to each of the other offenses. The defendant may be found guilty or not guilty of any one or all two of the offenses charged.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b6 6} When the jury retired to consider its verdicts it was given the certified copy of Harris' prior OVI conviction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {\u00b6 7} During its deliberations, the jury panel informed the court that they were unsure if they were required to consider one of the charges only if they had first found Harris guilty of the other charge. The trial court told the jury, \"Well, there are two separate offenses, and I would just tell you to look at the jury instructions and it's-consider the offenses separately.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   {\u00b6 8} The jury continued its deliberations and found Harris not guilty of R.C. 4511.19(A)(1)(a), and guilty of R.C. 4511.19(A)(2). The trial court thanked the jurors for their service and excused them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   {\u00b6 9} Harris immediately made an oral Crim.R. 29(C) motion for a judgment of acquittal on grounds that the verdicts were inconsistent. He maintained that if the\n   jury had acquitted him of operating a vehicle under the influence of alcohol under R.C. 4511.19(A)(1)(a), \"it was not possible that he could [commit the] operate a vehicle under the influence and refuse [offense]\" as the jury had found. He concluded that, \"Operating a motor vehicle under the influence is a part of the other charge, judge.\" The trial court denied the oral motion on the grounds that, as it had instructed the jury, the charges were separate and independent offenses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   {\u00b6 10} Within the 14-day time period provided, Harris filed a motion for a new trial pursuant to Crim.R. 33(A)(4) and renewed his motion for judgment of acquittal pursuant to Crim.R. 29(C). Each motion raised only the single issue of the sufficiency of the evidence to support the inconsistent verdicts. These motions were denied and Harris brought these appeals.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     II. Inconsistent Verdicts\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   {\u00b6 11} In his first assignment of error, Harris contends that the trial court erred in denying his Crim.R. 29(C) post-verdict motion for judgment of acquittal on the grounds that the jury's verdicts were inconsistent. The gravamen of Harris' argument is that the jury's verdict acquitting him of driving under the influence under R.C 4511.19(A)(1)(a) negated an essential element of R.C. 4511.19(A)(2) and necessitated an acquittal on that charge as well.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     a. Crim.R. 29(C) motion\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   {\u00b6 12} A Crim.R. 29 motion challenges whether the state has presented evidence upon which a jury could have found the defendant guilty.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Dayton v. Rogers\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6691573\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ohio-st-2d/60/162/#p163\">\n    60 Ohio St.2d 162\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 163,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=398%20N.E.2d%20781\">\n    398 N.E.2d 781\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1979),\n   <em>\n    overruled on other grounds\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    State v.

If a verdict of guilty is returned, the court may on such motion set aside the verdict and enter judgment of acquittal. * * * It shall not be a prerequisite to the making of such motion that a similar motion has been made prior to the submission of the case to the jury.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   {\u00b6 14} Thus a Crim.R. 29(C) motion is not merely a delayed motion for judgment of acquittal. It can be used, as here, to challenge defects in the sufficiency of the evidence that only become apparent after the jury returns its verdicts.\n   <em>\n    E.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v. Glenn\n   </em>\n   , 1st Dist.

But Harris has preserved the inconsistent-verdicts issue for review. A defendant does not forfeit issues that he has raised with specificity in a timely Crim.R. 29(C) motion. Here, Harris raised the inconsistent-verdicts issue, and only that issue, in both his oral and his written post-verdict motions for judgment of acquittal. His oral and written motions drew the trial court's attention to the alleged error at a time when the error\n   could have been corrected or avoided. And he has assigned the denial of his post-verdict motion as error on appeal. Thus Harris has preserved the inconsistent-verdicts issue for appellate review.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

Inconsistent responses to different counts\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   {\u00b6 17} Harris maintains that because the jury acquitted him of driving under the influence of alcohol under the R.C. 4511.19(A)(1)(a) charge, there was insufficient evidence to convict him of R.C. 4511.19(A)(2). Harris maintains that he had been charged with a single offense, driving under the influence of alcohol, and that additional proof that he had refused a breathalyzer test and had had a prior OVI conviction were merely facts that supported a sentencing enhancement if he had been convicted of driving under the influence in the first instance. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   {\u00b6 18} There are four types of OVI offenses described in R.C. 4511.19(A). Each constitutes a separate offense. Operation of a motor vehicle under the influence of alcohol or drugs, as proscribed in R.C. 4511.19(A)(1)(a), is the basic OVI offense. The jury found Harris not guilty of this offense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   {\u00b6 19} A conviction under R.C. 4511.19(A)(2) also requires proof beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant operated a motor vehicle while under the influence of alcohol or drugs. But this offense is distinguished from a violation under R.C. 4511.19(A)(1)(a) because the state must also prove that the defendant refused to submit to a chemical test while under arrest for the current OVI violation and that he had a prior OVI conviction within 20 years of the current violation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

The jury was then brought into the courtroom and the trial began with opening statements. Agreements, waivers, and stipulations made by a defendant, or by his counsel in his presence, in open court are binding and enforceable.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v. Post\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1827880\" index=\"97\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ohio-st-3d/32/380/#p393\">\n    32 Ohio St.3d 380\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 393,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"98\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=513%20N.E.2d%20754\">\n    513 N.E.2d 754\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1987), citing\n   <em>\n    State v.

We note that the uniform traffic ticket that Officer Shreve executed to begin this prosecution named the offender as \"Mason Angilo Harris, Jr.\" The state had notified the prospective jurors, at voir dire, that \"you will hear evidence that the defendant was convicted of an OVI on February 13th, 2015.\" Harris did not contest this statement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   {\u00b6 39} Moments after the stipulation discussion, the state informed the jury, in its opening statement, that \"[i]n this case you will hear evidence that the defendant * * * had a prior OVI conviction on February 13th of 2015.\" Harris did not object, seek a curative instruction, or move for a mistrial. Harris' defense counsel then informed the jury, in his opening statement, that \"Mr. Harris has had a DUI in the past.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   {\u00b6 40} Based upon the foregoing exchanges, we hold that Harris had entered into a stipulation as to the authenticity and admissibility of the certified copy of the February 13, 2015 Clermont County judgment entry as proof of his prior OVI conviction.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Waheed\n   </em>\n   , 1st Dist.

In light of that stipulation and Harris' acknowledgement of the prior OVI conviction in open court, reasonable minds could have reached different conclusions as to whether the prior-conviction element of the charged crime had been proved beyond a reasonable doubt.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   R.C. 4511.19(A)(2). Thus the trial court did not err, much less commit plain error, in failing to grant Harris' Crim.R. 29(C) motion for judgment of acquittal.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bridgeman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1801630\" index=\"103\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ohio-st-2d/55/261/\">\n    55 Ohio St.2d 261\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"104\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=381%20N.E.2d%20184\">\n    381 N.E.2d 184\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at syllabus.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   {\u00b6 41} The second assignment of error is overruled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     V. Harris Abandons Other Appeals\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   {\u00b6 42} Harris has sought appellate review of two additional judgments entered against him in the trial court, for driving with a suspended license, and for disobeying a traffic control device, as charged in the cases numbered C-15TRC-31149C and C-15TRC-31149D. But Harris has failed to raise any assignments of error challenging those judgments. Therefore we must dismiss those appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   {\u00b6 43} On direct appeal, this court is limited to determining the merits of any appeal \"on the assignments of error set forth in the briefs.\" App.R. 12(A)(1)(b). Thus to receive consideration on appeal, trial court errors must be raised by assignment of error and must be argued and supported by legal authority and citation to the record.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   App.R. 16(A) ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.
