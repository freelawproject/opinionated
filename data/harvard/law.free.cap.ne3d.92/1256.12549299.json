Johnson, appeals from a judgment of the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas convicting him of trafficking in drugs, in violation of R.C. 2953.03. For the reasons that follow, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   {\u00b6 2} On November 4, 2015, Franklin County Sheriff's Deputy Travis Carter arrested appellant for heroin possession following a traffic stop. On November 13, 2015, a Franklin County Grand Jury indicted appellant for trafficking in heroin, in violation of R.C. 2925.03, a felony of the first degree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 3} On December 31, 2015, appellant filed a motion to suppress the evidence discovered by police in the warrantless search of his person. Plaintiff-appellee, State of Ohio, did not file a written memorandum in opposition. The trial court conducted an evidentiary hearing on the motion on July 28, 2016. The facts underlying appellant's arrest are set out in the testimony at the suppression hearing. Detective John C. Whitacre testified that he was a 23-year veteran of the Columbus Division of Police who had been working on the narcotics squad since 2013. Whitacre testified that in September 2015, he began investigating a group of individuals who allegedly operated a narcotics ring on the east side of Columbus. According to Whitacre, he received information through informants regarding the names, addresses, and vehicles used by the suspects. Whitacre subsequently obtained a court order to install GPS monitors on the suspect vehicles. As a result of surveillance, Whitacre's team arrested several suspects on the east side of Columbus on heroin trafficking charges.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 4} Whitacre testified that the members of a suspected heroin trafficking ring on the west side of Columbus subsequently began using the same vehicles. After obtaining another warrant, Whitacre's team began surveilling individuals suspected of drug trafficking. As a result of the continued surveillance, Whitacre's team subsequently made several arrests and recovered large sums of cash and narcotics from various individuals. One of the individuals identified by Whitacre's team as a member of the drug trafficking ring was Ivan Navarro. The police suspected Navarro was delivering drugs to individuals he met briefly in certain public parking lots. On October 22, 2015, police followed Navarro to a Walmart parking lot on Rome-Hilliard Road, where he parked next to a pickup truck with no visible registration tag. The driver of the pickup truck approached Navarro's vehicle and retrieved a box, which he placed in his pickup truck. A state trooper followed the pickup truck when it left the parking lot and stopped it. It was discovered that the box contained $29,000 in cash.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 5} On November 4, 2015, Navarro arrived at the same Walmart parking lot and parked next to a 2006 Lexus, which displayed no front license plate. Police observed the driver of the vehicle, later identified as appellant, enter Navarro's vehicle, stay for a short time, and then return to his vehicle. Though the surveillance team did not see an exchange between the two men, they suspected a drug transaction had taken place. Whitacre testified that he instructed the surveillance team, which included Detective Mark Johnson, to follow appellant's vehicle as it left the parking lot. Johnson testified that he followed appellant's vehicle on I-270, but he backed off when he saw a marked Franklin County Sheriff's vehicle come up behind appellant's\n   vehicle. Johnson did not observe the subsequent traffic stop.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 6} Carter, a 16-year veteran of the Franklin County Sheriff's Department, made the traffic stop of appellant's vehicle. Carter testified that because he was a member of the High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area (\"HIDTA\") Task Force, he was able to receive a transmission over the encrypted walkie-talkie system from a Sergeant Biney asking if there were any officers in the vicinity of I-270 and Georgesville Road. When Carter responded, Biney told him that Whitacre requested a traffic stop of a vehicle failing to display a front license plate and possibly containing evidence of illegal narcotics. After obtaining a description of the suspect vehicle and its location, Carter came up behind the suspect's vehicle after it exited I-270 and initiated a traffic stop.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b6 7} According to Carter, he approached appellant's vehicle on the passenger side, asked appellant for his license and vehicle registration, and instructed appellant to get out of the vehicle. Carter walked around the back of appellant's vehicle and met appellant at the rear of the vehicle. Carter asked appellant if he had any weapons and he responded that he did not. When Carter asked appellant for permission to conduct a pat-down search for weapons, appellant responded \"[y]es.\" (July 28, 2016 Tr. at 45.) As Carter began patting down appellant, he noticed a bulge in appellant's right front pants pocket. When Carter asked appellant what it was, \"he fled on foot.\" (Tr. at 46.) Carter gave chase and caught up with appellant when he stumbled and fell in the parking lot of a Certified gas station. Carter placed appellant in handcuffs and then \"searched all pockets incident to arrest and found a large bag of what appeared to be brown powder heroin in his right front pocket.\" (Tr. at 46.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {\u00b6 8} Detective Clint A. Smith subsequently arrived at the scene of the arrest and conducted an interview of appellant who was handcuffed in the back of a police cruiser. During the interview, appellant admitted that he was a heroin user and that the heroin found on his person was intended for his own personal use. Appellant denied that he sold drugs. Smith subsequently authored a report regarding the events leading to appellant's arrest and interrogation. Smith's HIDTA Task Force Report (\"report\") was admitted into evidence as Defendant's Exhibit 1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   {\u00b6 9} Immediately following the hearing on appellant's motion to suppress, the trial court announced its decision denying the motion. Appellant subsequently pleaded no contest to the charge in the indictment. On September 8, 2016, the trial court sentenced appellant to a prison term of three years, suspended appellant's driver's license for six months, and imposed a monetary sanction of $20,000.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   {\u00b6 10} Appellant timely appealed to this court from his conviction and sentence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

Based on the registration information Whitacre could see, he was able to learn the name of the vehicle owner and he forwarded that information to other members of his team along with the description of the vehicle. As Johnson followed appellant's vehicle after it left the Walmart parking lot, he \"began airing over the radio his location,\" and he was able to confirm the license plate violation. (Tr. at 59.) Carter testified that Biney, via the HIDTA Task Force encrypted walkie-talkie system, \"asked if anyone was in the area of 270 and Georgesville Road on the west side of Franklin County.\" (Tr. at 44.) Biney informed Carter that Whitacre \"wanted me to stop a vehicle that was possibly involved in narcotics activity [and] did not have a front license plate.\" (Tr. at 45.) Thus, the evidence in the record establishes that Carter received information regarding the suspected narcotics activity involving appellant's vehicle and the license plate violation through Whitacre, who had personally observed the license plate violation. Under\n   <em>\n    Muldrow\n   </em>\n   , it does not matter that Carter did not observe the equipment violation prior to initiating the traffic stop or that he did not speak directly with Whitacre.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   {\u00b6 23} Appellant argues that\n   <em>\n    Muldrow\n   </em>\n   is distinguishable because the defendant in that case had been a suspect in an ongoing narcotics investigation and had been observed leaving a residence which was the subject of a search warrant, whereas appellant had not previously been suspected of involvement in the narcotics activity being investigated by the HIDTA Task Force. We agree that\n   <em>\n    Muldrow\n   </em>\n   is not on all fours with the present case. Nevertheless, we find that the logic of the collective knowledge doctrine applies with equal weight to this case inasmuch as the critical fact justifying the\n   <em>\n    Terry\n   </em>\n   stop in this case was the equipment violation observed by Whitacre and reported to Carter through the members of the HIDTA Task Force.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   {\u00b6 24} The crux of the collective knowledge doctrine is that knowledge of law enforcement officers is imputed to other officers.\n   <em>\n    Muldrow\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 18. Under\n   <em>\n    Muldrow\n   </em>\n   , where an officer making an investigative stop relies solely on information provided in a dispatch, a\n   <em>\n    Terry\n   </em>\n   stop is constitutionally valid provided the state demonstrates at a suppression hearing that the facts precipitating the dispatch justified a reasonable suspicion of criminal activity.\n   <em>\n    Muldrow\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 21.

The license plate violation provided a legal justification for the traffic stop. Whether the additional information regarding the suspected narcotics transaction would have justified a reasonable suspicion of drug possession is neither relevant nor dispositive\n   of the legality of the traffic stop in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   {\u00b6 25} Appellant next contends that the equipment violation was merely a pretext for conducting an illegal narcotics investigation given Carter's admission that he stopped appellant's vehicle with the intent to conduct an investigation into illegal drug activity.

Important factors in determining the voluntariness of consent are: (1) the voluntariness of the defendant's custodial status; (2) the presence of coercive police procedures; (3) the extent and level of the defendant's cooperation with the police; (4) the defendant's awareness of his right to refuse to consent; (5) the defendant's education and intelligence; and (6) the defendant's belief that no incriminating evidence will be found.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   (Emphasis sic.)

We have determined that the initial traffic stop was lawful due to the equipment violation. The evidence establishes that appellant gave his consent for the pat-down search only 30 to 45 seconds after Carter instructed him to exit his vehicle. There is no evidence that appellant resisted Carter's request to exit the vehicle or that he was otherwise uncooperative.

The evidence in the record belies appellant's claim. Smith's report reveals the following:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-70\">\n   Detective Smith conducted the interview of [appellant] in the presence of Deputy Carter while he was secured in the rear of the F.C.S.O. marked vehicle. Detective Smith read the Miranda warning to [appellant]. [Appellant] stated that he would talk to Detective Smith but did not want to sign the rights waiver form. Verbal consent was given in front of Detective Smith and Deputy Carter, who signed the rights waiver form as witness to his verbal consent. The contents of the interview are as follows:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-71\">\n   -[Appellant] hoped to escape by running\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-72\">\n   -The heroin in his pocket was for personal use\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-73\">\n   -He does not sell heroin\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-74\">\n   -The heroin was to support his habit\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-75\">\n   -That amount of heroin would last him a month\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-76\">\n   -He didn't want to talk anymore if there was no opportunity to not go to jail.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-77\">\n   The interview was concluded, and [appellant] was transported and slated by F.C.S.O.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   (Defendant's Ex. 1.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   {\u00b6 36} Smith's written report establishes that appellant made the statements attributed to him after he received\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   warnings. There is no evidence in the record contradicting the information in the report regarding the\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   warnings. Thus, there is no support for appellant's contention that police violated his\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   rights.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   {\u00b6 37} For the foregoing reasons, we hold that the trial court did not err when it denied appellant's motion to suppress the evidence uncovered in the search of appellant's person and the initial interrogation by police. Accordingly, appellant's first assignment of error is overruled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Second Assignment of Error\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   {\u00b6 38} In appellant's second assignment of error, appellant argues that the trial court erred and abused its discretion by imposing a fine of $20,000. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   {\u00b6 39} Appellant first contends that the trial court misconstrued the relevant statutory law when it imposed a $20,000 fine. R.C. 2929.18 pertaining to \"[f]inancial sanctions,\" provides, in relevant part, as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-84\">\n   (A)(3) Except as provided in division (B)(1), (3), or (4) of this section, a fine payable by the offender to the state, to a political subdivision when appropriate for a felony, or as described in division (B)(2) of this section to one or more law enforcement agencies, in the following amount:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-85\">\n   (a)\n   <em>\n    For a felony of the first degree, not more than twenty thousand dollars\n   </em>\n   ;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-86\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-87\">\n   (B)(1) For a first, second, or third degree felony violation of any provision of Chapter 2925., 3719., or 4729. of the Revised Code,\n   <em>\n    the sentencing court shall impose upon the offender a mandatory fine of at least one-half of, but not more than, the maximum statutory fine amount authorized for the level of the offense pursuant to division (A)(3) of this section\n   </em>\n   . If an offender alleges in an affidavit filed with the court prior to sentencing that the offender is indigent and unable to pay the mandatory fine and if the court determines the offender is an indigent person and is unable to pay the mandatory fine described in this division, the court shall not impose the mandatory fine upon the offender.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   (Emphasis added.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   {\u00b6 40} Because the trial court convicted appellant of a first-degree felony under R.C. 2929.18, a $10,000 fine is mandatory. Appellant contends that the trial transcript shows that the trial court believed that the mandatory fine was $20,000. The transcript of the sentencing hearing provides as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-90\">\n   [Prosecuting Attorney:] It's my understanding he's wishing to withdraw his formerly entered plea of not guilty and enter a plea of no contest to that offense, trafficking in heroin, as a felony of the first degree.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-91\">\n   That offense is punishable by up to three years to eleven years of mandatory incarceration in the Ohio Department of Rehabilitation,\n   <em>\n    up to a $20,000 fine\n   </em>\n   , which is a mandatory fine, five years of mandatory post-release control when incarcerated and a mandatory Bureau of Motor Vehicle driver's license suspension for not less than six months nor more than five years.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-92\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-93\">\n   THE COURT: All right. By signing this document, you're pleading no contest to the count of trafficking in heroin. That's a felony in the first degree. That carries a mandatory prison sentence from three to eleven years and a mandatory fine of $20,000. You're not eligible for probation. You have to go to prison because it's mandatory.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   (Emphasis added.) (Sept. 6, 2016 Tr. at 8, 10.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   {\u00b6 41} The September 6, 2016 \"Entry of No Contest Plea\" signed by appellant, his trial counsel, and the trial court correctly identifies the fine for appellant's offense as \"up to $20,000\" and further identifies the mandatory portion of the fine as \"at Least One-Half of the Maximum for the Underlying Offense.\" Though language used by the trial court at the sentencing hearing and in the subsequent judgment entry suggest that the trial court may have believed a $20,000 fine was mandatory, the trial court was aware that there is a mandatory fine for appellant's offense of \"up to\" $20,000. Accordingly,\n   the record does not disclose a legal error with regard to the amount of the fine.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   {\u00b6 42} Appellant next contends that the trial court erred by failing to consider his ability to pay the fine. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   {\u00b6 43} Appellant pleaded no contest to the indictment and the trial court proceeded immediately to sentencing. Consequently, there was no presentence investigation. Appellant did not file an affidavit with the trial court prior to sentencing alleging that he is indigent and unable to pay the mandatory fine. R.C. 2929.18(B)(1). Because appellant did not file an affidavit of indigence alleging he is \"unable to pay the mandatory fine,\" the trial court was required to impose a fine on appellant of at least $10,000, one-half of the $20,000 authorized by statute.\n   <em>\n    State v.

According to the prosecutor, 160 grams of heroin results in a minimum of 1,500 doses.
