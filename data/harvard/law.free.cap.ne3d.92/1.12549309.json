Colley appeals his conviction in the Scioto County Court of Common Pleas after a jury found him guilty of one count of illegal assembly or possession of chemicals for the manufacture of drugs, a third-degree felony. On appeal, Colley contends: (1) the trial court erred in denying his motion for a directed verdict on the ground of improper venue; (2) the evidence was insufficient as a matter of law or, in the alternative, his conviction was against the manifest weight of the evidence, when the State presented no evidence of \"intent to manufacture\" methamphetamine; and (3) the trial court erred in permitting evidence of third parties' purchase of pseudoephedrine, unrelated to his case. Upon review, we find no merit to Appellant's arguments. As such the trial court did not err. Accordingly, we overrule Appellant's three assignments of error and affirm the judgment of the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   FACTS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   {\u00b6 2} On May 20, 2015, Robert C. Colley was indicted on one count of illegal assembly or possession of chemicals for the manufacture of drugs, a violation of R.C. 2925.041(A), and a felony of the third degree. The indictment occurred after an officer for the Ohio Department of Natural Resources (\"ODNR\") discovered two discarded bags of trash containing three boxes of pseudoephedrine product, an active ingredient used for the assembly of methamphetamine, along Big Run Road in the Shawnee State Forest. Items in both trash bags belonged to Jeannie Kinzer, Appellant's codefendant and girlfriend at the time.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   While none of the items were directly linked to Appellant, ODNR's investigation revealed that Appellant had purchased pseudoephedrine close in time to purchases made by Kinzer. Kinzer's trial testimony later linked some of the contents in the trash bags to Appellant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 3} Appellant proceeded to a jury trial on February 23, 2016. The State's case began with testimony from ODNR Officer Bryce Morris. Officer Morris testified regarding his background and training in recognition and awareness of clandestine labs for the production of methamphetamine. On October 12, 2014, Officer Morris was patrolling the Brush Creek State Forest area in Scioto County, investigating litter dump sites along the road, when he discovered two trash bags. This area of Scioto County is not far from the Pike County, Ohio, line. Officer Morris testified he was looking for items which could be connected to the production of methamphetamine.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 4} Officer Morris searched the trash bags and found the following:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   1) An envelope from the Ohio Department of Job and Family Services addressed to \"Jeannie Kinzer\" at \"1926 McDermott Rushtown Road\";\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   2) An empty package of electrical tape;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   3) A Kroger magazine addressed to \"Derrick Tackett\" at the same address on McDermott-Rushtown Road;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   4) An ice compress with the top right hand corner cut; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   5) Three boxes of Leader Allergy Relief D-24.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   {\u00b6 5} Officer Morris testified pseudoephedrine is an active ingredient in the manufacture of methamphetamine and the three boxes of Leader Allergy Relief D-24 were sold at Bartley's Discount Pharmacy in Waverly, located in Pike County, Ohio. The ingredients listed on the boxes include pseudoephedrine sulfate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   {\u00b6 6} Officer Morris testified in the \"one-pot\" method of manufacture, electrical tape may be used to seal off a bottle to make it airtight. He also explained the product inside an ice compress, ammonium nitrate, is one of the ingredients for manufacture. The corner being cut on the compress was not the typical use of a compress, because the ammonium should not touch one's skin.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   {\u00b6 7} In the second trash bag, Officer Morris found the following:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   1) Multiple empty pill blister packs from the three empty boxes of Leader Allergy Relief D-24, from Bartley's Pharmacy;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   2) A grocery list of various items including sea salt and coffee filters;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   3) A capped and empty 20-ounce Mello Yello bottle, containing a capped syringe.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   {\u00b6 8} Officer Morris testified coffee filters are used to filter liquid and leave behind crystallized methamphetamine.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   {\u00b6 9} Officer Morris further testified after looking through the items, he began researching Jeannie Kinzer and Derrick Tackett's names and addresses in OLEG,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   and another database, NPLEX.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Officer Morris identified a summary record of Jeannie Kinzer's pseudoephedrine purchases, showing transaction dates and locations. Officer Morris also identified an NPLEX record and summary of Appellant's pseudoephedrine purchases at Bartley's Pharmacy and at a Walmart Pharmacy both in Waverly, Ohio.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   {\u00b6 10} Andy Canterbury, the Asset Production Manager at the Waverly Walmart, testified about Walmart's video surveillance system. He testified there are approximately 180 cameras inside the store. The cameras record for approximately 93 days. Canterbury is able to view multiple cameras at a time, link them together, and watch an individual moving throughout the store.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   {\u00b6 11} Canterbury testified that on October 19, 2014, he assisted Officer Morris in reviewing several days of surveillance video. Canterbury identified a CD he burned for Officer Morris, showing Jeannie Kinzer and Appellant purchasing pseudoephedrine products. Canterbury also took still photographs from the video. Canterbury identified an overshot of a register, an electronic journal from the Waverly store, and the still photographs taken from the video surveillance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   {\u00b6 12} On October 19, 2014, Officer Morris and another ODNR officer, Charles Carlson, went to Walmart with the NPLEX records to review the Walmart footage. They had enlarged BMV photos of Appellant and Jeanie Kinzer. On October 3rd, they observed a red Ford Explorer entering the parking lot and Kinzer entering the store. They were able to match the surveillance video with the database records of purchase. Kinzer purchased Sudafed. Also on that date, Appellant purchased Leader Allergy Relief D-24 at Bartley's.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   {\u00b6 13} The officers also reviewed the pharmacy counter camera and then back-tracked to find Appellant and Kinzer's vehicle in the parking lot. Kinzer then met with two other individuals-Appellant and a third subject. The group met at the pharmacy counter, then separated. Kinzer left the store and pulled a red Ford Explorer near the front of the store. Appellant was observed in the video checking out.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Appellant and the other individual left the store and got into Kinzer's vehicle.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   {\u00b6 14} Morris also testified that on August 23rd surveillance footage, Kinzer was at the front desk purchasing and they matched her record with NPLEX. They also viewed Appellant exiting the store, with Sudafed purchases recorded on that date.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   {\u00b6 15} As a result of viewing these tapes, Morris attempted to interview Kinzer at the address found in the trash bags. They were able to locate Derrick Tackett, her brother. The officers were unable to\n   make contact with Kinzer. Meanwhile, the Mello Yello bottle with the syringe was tested for DNA by the Ohio Bureau of Criminal Identification and Investigation (\"BCI\"). The DNA was matched to Jeannie Kinzer.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Based on the investigation, Officer Morris filed indictments against both Appellant and Kinzer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   {\u00b6 16} On cross-examination, Officer Morris testified he has investigated 3 methamphetamine cases. He admitted his duties are \"spread pretty thin.\" He also acknowledged:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   1) He was testifying from his report prepared 18 months earlier;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   2) The Mello Yello bottle was the only DNA sample sent to BCI;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   3) He did not order fingerprinting and did not take a statement from Kinzer;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   4) Other entries in the NPLEX summary show Kinzer purchasing without Appellant's presence;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   5) Appellant also purchased Claritin-D within the legal limits and on dates he was allowed to purchase;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   6) Officer Morris never reviewed Appellant's medical history; and,\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   7) None of the documents in the trash bags could be directly connected to Appellant.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   {\u00b6 17} On redirect, Morris reiterated the significance of the NPLEX purchase records. Kinzer's summary demonstrates she made 16 purchases of pseudoephedrine products between April 1, 2014 and January 8, 2015. Appellant made 12 purchases in 2014. Five times in 2014, Appellant and Kinzer purchased on the same date.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   {\u00b6 18} The next witness, Thomas Kelley, the Pharmacy Manager at Waverly Walmart, testified pseudoephedrine is a stimulant decongestant, an over-the-counter product used for relief of cold symptoms. Although it is not an allergy medicine, it is sometimes combined with allergy medicine. Kelley testified pseudoephedrine is used illegally to reduce it from its current form into methamphetamine.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   {\u00b6 19} Kelley further testified due to the Control Methamphetamine Act, pharmacies must maintain records of pseudoephedrine sales. A person purchasing pseudoephedrine has to provide the purchaser's address and a current photo ID, without alteration. Walmart keeps its own database in the home office, in the normal course of business, and the records are shared with NPLEX.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   {\u00b6 20} Kelley testified he saw many individuals from Scioto County, Ohio, with no patient relationship to the Walmart Pharmacy, attempting to purchase pseudoephedrine. Specifically, he testified on a typical day, 30-40 people request pseudoephedrine and half, if not more, are residents from Scioto County. He has visually verified this fact by viewing driver's licenses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   {\u00b6 21} Kelley identified purchase records for Jeannie Kinzer and for Appellant. Kinzer's purchase record showed Allergy and Congestion Relief purchased on August 23, 2014. Both items can be broken down to make methamphetamine. On October 3, 2014, Kinzer purchased Decongestant, 12 hour Max. Appellant's purchase record reflected purchases of drugs that can be converted to methamphetamine.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   {\u00b6 22} On cross examination, Kelley explained that decongestant is used to relieve nasal pressure. Under Ohio law, a person can buy 3.6 grams per day. Kelley\n   acknowledged none of his records showed Appellant making illegal purchases.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   {\u00b6 23} Vanessa Rigsby, a manager at Bartley's Pharmacy, testified she trains other employees on pseudoephedrine sales and is aware of illegal uses. Rigsby also explained the procedure for pseudoephedrine sales. When a customer requests a product, Bartley's computer scans the driver's license and the product. Once that is done, the computer will advise if the sale can be completed, or if the purchaser has bought the limit anywhere else. The electronic records are stored in Bartley's computer, kept in the normal course of business, and shared with NPLEX. Rigsby identified an October 3, 2014 record of purchase of Leader Allergy Relief D-24 from Bartley's, sold to Appellant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   {\u00b6 24} Officer Charles Carlson, an investigator for ODNR, testified that ODNR had recently been finding methamphetamine dumps along the roadways. He assisted in the cleanup of these dumps. Officer Carlson also testified as to the ingredients used and the process for breaking down pseudoephedrine and making it into methamphetamine.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   {\u00b6 25} On October 12, 2014, Officer Morris contacted Officer Carlson and showed him pictures of the trash collected. The totality of the ingredients discarded led Officer Carlson to believe a one-pot method had been discarded. Since there were no fingerprints, they tested DNA on the bottle. They also had receipts and tracked the purchasers through NPLEX. Carlson identified the State's exhibits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   {\u00b6 26} On cross-examination, Officer Carlson testified he is one of six investigators for 25 counties. He testified he and Officer Morris linked Appellant to the bags through the video surveillance showing his purchases.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   {\u00b6 27} The State's last witness was Jeannie Kinzer. She testified she is 36 years old, an admitted drug addict for 11 years. She was currently in treatment. Kinzer also admitted she has a felony conviction for illegal manufacturing, for which she received a five-year sentence of probation, and two petty theft convictions from other counties. She was subpoenaed and did not want to testify against Appellant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   {\u00b6 28} Kinzer met Appellant when they were teenagers. They reconnected in 2013. At the time, Appellant was in treatment. They formed a relationship after he completed treatment in 2013. Kinzer used methamphetamine, for the first time, with Appellant on New Year's Eve 2014.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   {\u00b6 29} Kinzer testified the Big Run Road area was a solitary place, about three miles from where they lived. She and Appellant went there to be alone and to \"shoot up\" because it was private. Kinzer testified she used Suboxone or methamphetamine. Towards the end of 2014, she was using Suboxone and methamphetamine, with Appellant, daily. They administered it through syringes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   {\u00b6 30} Kinzer testified she would purchase pseudoephedrine and then trade it for Suboxone, money, or methamphetamine. She always went to the Waverly Walmart. Sometimes Appellant went with her. He was also purchasing pseudoephedrine, but she did not see what he did with his boxes. Importantly, Kinzer testified Appellant \"always\" drove her vehicle because he did not like the way she drove.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   {\u00b6 31} Kinzer identified a photograph of her vehicle, herself, and Appellant on October 3, 2014. She also identified her signature\n   for a purchase of a pseudoephedrine product. Kinzer also identified her Job and Family Services mail with the McDermott-Rushtown Road address, as well as the grocery list in her writing. She testified the sea salt and coffee filters on the list had nothing to do with her making methamphetamine. Kinzer denied throwing out the trash bags on Big Run. She also denied cutting the corner of the ice pack.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   {\u00b6 32} Kinzer identified her brother's name, Derrick Tackett, on the Kroger magazine. Kinzer testified her brother always gave her his Kroger coupons, but he had nothing to do with the items located in the trash bags. He was not living with her at the time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   {\u00b6 33} Kinzer testified Appellant purchased at Bartley's Pharmacy if they could not get pseudoephedrine from Walmart. Kinzer testified during the time she was using methamphetamine, she did not know who was actually making it. Appellant would take the boxes of pseudoephedrine and come back with methamphetamine. He had a lot of contacts and he didn't want her to meet them, for her protection. Specifically, she testified \"I do not know if he was making it.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   {\u00b6 34} On cross-examination, Kinzer admitted she had worked at a nursing home in Hillsboro and was suspended for suspicion of theft of narcotics. She testified she had already violated her probation by testing positive for methamphetamine. She testified in the past she had observed Appellant sleeping and sometimes he had difficulty breathing. Kinzer also recalled writing Appellant a letter in which she said she felt pressured to testify against him. She testified she did not recall the Mello Yello bottle or the other items she was shown by the prosecutor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   {\u00b6 35} At this point, the State moved to admit all but one of its exhibits, and the court granted this motion. Defense counsel moved for a directed verdict on the issue of venue, arguing that none of the actions alleged to be in violation of the law occurred in Scioto County. The motion for directed verdict was overruled. Then the State rested. Appellant did not present evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   {\u00b6 36} The jury found Appellant guilty. He was subsequently sentenced to a maximum prison term of thirty-six months. This timely appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   ASSIGNMENTS OF ERROR\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-62\">\n   \"I. THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN DENYING APPELLANT'S MOTION FOR A DIRECTED VERDICT AT THE CLOSE OF THE STATE'S CASE ON THE GROUND OF IMPROPER VENUE.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-63\">\n   II. THE EVIDENCE WAS INSUFFICIENT AS A MATTER OF LAW TO CONVICT APPELLANT OF ILLEGAL ASSEMBLY OR POSSESSION OF CHEMICALS FOR THE MANUFACTURE OF DRUGS AS INDICTED; OR, IN THE ALTERNATIVE, THE CONVICTIONS WERE AGAINST THE MANIFEST WEIGHT OF THE EVIDENCE.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-64\">\n   III. THE COURT ERRED IN PERMITTING THE TESTIMONY OF THOMAS KELLEY REGARDING UNKNOWN THIRD PARTY CONDUCT IN PURCHASING PSEUDOEPHEDRINE FROM WAVERLY WALMART WHEN SUCH ALLEGED INCIDENTS ARE UNRELATED TO THE PRESENT CASE AND THE SAME ARE SEVERELY PREJUDICIAL.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR ONE\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   {\u00b6 37} Under the first assignment of error, Appellant points out that venue is\n   an essential element of proving a criminal defendant's guilt at trial. At the close of trial, Appellant's counsel moved for a directed verdict on the ground of improper venue inasmuch as there was no evidence Appellant committed any illegal acts in Scioto County. Appellant argues the evidence is clear that all of the events in question occurred in Pike County, not Scioto County, as alleged in the indictment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   {\u00b6 38} In response, Appellee acknowledges that the series of events by which Appellant and Kinzer gathered materials to manufacture methamphetamine began by purchasing pseudoephedrine in Pike County. However, Appellee asserts there is no authority which requires all events leading to a criminal act to occur within one county. Moreover, the evidence that was linked to the criminal activity was dumped and discovered in Scioto County. Appellee concludes there was competent credible evidence beyond a reasonable doubt upon which to overcome a Crim.R. 29 motion for acquittal based on venue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   A.

On appeal, Mercer argued no State's witness explicitly testified that the store was located in Ross County. However, we observed although the State did not provide explicit testimony as to venue, the State did present evidence that the Chillicothe Police Department responded to the report. We concluded that while the State's evidence might be far from overwhelming, it was sufficient to establish venue. A reasonable fact-finder could determine that the Chillicothe Police Department's response to the scene indicated that the Menards store was located in Ross County.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

Young,\n   </em>\n   4th Dist. Meigs No. 458,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=1992%20WL%20188485\">\n    1992 WL 188485\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , (July 28, 1992). There Young appealed from a kidnapping conviction, arguing on appeal that there was insufficient evidence that the proper venue was in Ohio. The defendant claimed that all the elements of the crime occurred in West Virginia. However, we found viewing the evidence in a light most favorable to the prosecution, any rational trier of fact could have found that the occurrence in Meigs County, Ohio, in particular of all of or at least part of the deception to remove the victim from her home in Ohio, had been proven beyond a reasonable doubt. Observing the requirements of R.C. 2901.01(A) and (G), we stated: \"It is not\n   essential to criminal responsibility that the accused do every act necessary to accomplish the crime within the jurisdiction where he is prosecuted. Venue lies for all the offenses in any jurisdiction in which any of the elements of the offense were committed.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   {\u00b6 45} We considered the defendant's argument that venue had not been sufficiently proven in\n   <em>\n    State v. Cremeans,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6711430\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ohio-app-3d/5/8/\">\n    5 Ohio App.3d 8\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=448%20N.E.2d%20837\">\n    448 N.E.2d 837\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (4th Dist. 1982). There, Cremeans was convicted for unlawfully interfering with a game protector performing his duties. On appeal, Cremeans argued the trial court erred by overruling his motion for a directed verdict, based upon improper venue, when the exact location where the offense occurred was unknown by the State of Ohio. Citing the venue statute, R.C. 2901.012(G), we observed that the evidence was uncontroverted that the offense occurred close to the Athens County and Meigs County boundary lines. We agreed with the trial court's conclusion finding R.C. 2901.12(G) applicable under the facts of the case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   {\u00b6 46} More recently, in\n   <em>\n    State v. Wright, supra\n   </em>\n   , the defendant appealed from the judgment of the Athens County Court of Common Pleas convicting her of two counts of interference with custody and sentencing her to community control. Wright asserted that the trial court erred in denying her motion for judgment of acquittal at the close of the evidence because there was insufficient evidence of venue in Athens County when she, her husband, and their children did not reside in that county when the crimes occurred. We reasoned: \"Because the \"without privilege to do so\" element of the interference with custody offenses occurred in Athens County, the fact that Wright, her husband, and the children may not have been residents there on the date she removed the children from Ohio to Texas did not deprive Athens County from venue to try Wright for those offenses.\" After viewing the evidence in a light most favorable to the prosecution, we found a rational trier of fact could have found that the State had proven that Athens County was a proper venue for the criminal charges.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 34.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   {\u00b6 47} In the case sub judice, in making the Crim.R. 29 motion, defense counsel emphasized nothing in the trash bags was linked to Appellant, and that every action took place in Pike County. The State responded, citing Kinzer's testimony that Appellant \"always\" drove her car; that the trash was from her car; and that they went to Pike County to buy pseudoephedrine but brought it back to Scioto County and traded it for methamphetamine that they used on Big Run, where the trash was found. The trial court overruled the Rule 29 motion and we do not find this to be error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   {\u00b6 48} After reviewing the evidence in a light most favorable to the prosecution, any rational trier of fact could have found\n   that the element of venue, in Scioto County, proven beyond a reasonable doubt. The evidence is clear that Appellant purchased pseudoephedrine in Pike County. However, the ODNR officers discovered a clandestine lab, one-pot method, in trash bags discarded in Scioto County. The trash bags contained the various ingredients and precursors to methamphetamine production, i.e. the empty boxes of Leader Allergy Relief D-24; the cut ice compress; the empty blister packs; the grocery list for coffee filters and sea salt; and the Mello Yello bottle containing a syringe.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   {\u00b6 49} Jeannie Kinzer testified she did not make methamphetamine, but she gave her boxes of pseudoephedrine to Appellant and he returned with methamphetamine. She testified he always drove her car. She testified she did not cut the ice compress, and she did not discard the trash bags. These facts will be discussed further below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   {\u00b6 50} We find, however, any rational trier of fact could have found an element of the manufacture of methamphetamine, as in\n   <em>\n    Young,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=1992%20WL%20188485\">\n     supra\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , was committed in Scioto County. The evidence is uncontroverted that Appellant's offense, as in\n   <em>\n    Cremeans\n   </em>\n   , occurred close to the Scioto and Pike County line, making R.C. 2901.12(G) applicable to these facts. For the foregoing reasons, we find the trial court did not err by overruling Appellant's Crim.R. 29 motion for acquittal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR TWO\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   {\u00b6 51} Appellant argues under the second assignment of error that the evidence was legally insufficient to convict him or, in the alternative, that his conviction was against the manifest weight of the evidence. He contends there is no direct evidence that Appellant engaged in the illegal assembly or possession of chemicals for the manufacturing of drugs, specifically methamphetamine. Specifically, he argues the State presented no evidence linking him to the items discovered by the ODNR officers, only that he purchased pseudoephedrine and had used methamphetamine during the relevant time period. Moreover, he argues, the State's case used inferences and circumstantial evidence and failed to prove the essential element that Appellant had an intent to manufacture.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   A. STANDARD OF REVIEW\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   {\u00b6 52} When an appellate court considers a claim that a conviction is against the manifest weight of the evidence, the court must dutifully examine the entire record, weigh the evidence, and consider the credibility of witnesses. The reviewing court must bear in mind however, that credibility generally is an issue for the trier of fact to resolve.\n   <em>\n    State v. Wickersham,\n   </em>\n   4th Dist.

Seldon was charged with one count of assembly or possession of chemicals used for the manufacture of drugs and one count of carrying a concealed weapon subsequent to a lawful traffic stop. Seldon was driving his friend's truck and two others were riding with him. Pursuant to the stop, troopers located various items which can be used in the manufacture of a controlled substance. At trial, Seldon's father testified his son was going to look for work in the area at the time of his stop. Seldon testified some of the items in the truck were purchased by him that day, for the purpose of work on damaged or inoperable vehicles. He testified, in particular, to having matchbooks because he stamped them to advertise his services. He admitted 24 Sudafed pills were his, but a package of 96, and some starting fluid, were not his. He testified to having iodine in the vehicle to treat sores on his arm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   {\u00b6 62} Seldon further acknowledged trying methamphetamine, but testified it was years before, not one week before as a trooper had previously testified. He denied\n   that the items in the truck were purchased for the purpose of illegally manufacturing methamphetamine. He also denied knowing how to manufacture methamphetamine or having done so in the past. Although the jury returned a guilty verdict, the appellate court held the State failed to prove by sufficient evidence that Seldon possessed the chemicals discovered with an intent to manufacture methamphetamine.

Furthermore, none of the evidence produced was discovered on Appellant's person, such as chemicals and ingredients, physical equipment, or delivery devices. However, by the end of Appellant's trial, the jury had heard the following evidence:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-113\">\n   1) That Appellant and Kinzer purchased pseudoephedrine on the same dates at Pike County pharmacies:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-114\">\n   2) That garbage bags found in Scioto County contained the envelope addressed to Ms. Kinzer; 3 empty boxes of Leader Allergy Relief D-24; empty pill blister packs; an ice compress containing ammonium nitrate with the corner cut; an empty package of electrical tape; the grocery list; and a Mello Yello bottle containing a syringe;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-115\">\n   3) That Appellant and Kinzer purchased pseudoephedrine, traded it for methamphetamine, and Appellant handled the transactions to obtain methamphetamine;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-116\">\n   4) That the area where the trash bags were found was where Appellant and Kinzer regularly went to use drugs;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-117\">\n   5) That Officer Carlson opined the garbage bags contained a \"one-pot\" method which had been discarded;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-118\">\n   6) That Appellant \"always\" drove Kinzer's car;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-119\">\n   7) That Ms. Kinzer denied discarding the trash bags and cutting the corner of the ice pack containing the ammonium nitrate, and that she denied recognizing the Mello Yello bottle containing the syringe;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-120\">\n   8) That Ms. Kinzer's brother had \"nothing to do\" with the items found in the trash bags;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-121\">\n   9) That Asset Production Manager Andy Canterbury verified the Walmart security camera footage and receipts for items purchased by Appellant and Ms. Kinzer on October 3, 2014;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-122\">\n   10) That Ms. Kinzer admitted she and Appellant used syringes to inject methamphetamine; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-123\">\n   11) That Ms. Kinzer specified Appellant took her boxes of pseudoephedrine and returned with methamphetamine.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   {\u00b6 66} Based on our review of the trial transcript, we find there was circumstantial evidence in this case supporting the conclusion that Appellant intended to manufacture methamphetamine. Officer Carlson opined the trash bags contained a \"one-pot method\" discarded in a clandestine location in Scioto County. Appellant was familiar with the area where the trash bags containing the ingredients were discarded because he went there almost daily in late 2014 to inject methamphetamine. Appellant engaged in suspicious transactions and enlisted Kinzer to purchase it for him. They purchased pseudoephedrine together, in frequent transactions, at two different pharmacies.

While Kinzer denied knowledge of the Mello Yello bottle containing her DNA and syringe found in the trash, the jury was free to believe some, all, or none of her testimony, and was instructed accordingly. Combing Kinzer's denials, along with the absence of any evidence that other person or person had control or custody of her car or the trash bags, circumstantially links Appellant to the \"one-pot method\" discarded alongside the desolate Scioto County road.

Isaac, who was temporarily staying with a friend while experiencing marital problems, asserted she had no knowledge of the methamphetamine lab in the basement of her friends' residence. Isaac maintained the State did not demonstrate her knowledge of the methamphetamine lab or the possession of chemicals in the basement. The appellate court disagreed, holding at \u00b6 57 :\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-132\">\n   \"Viewing the evidence in a light most favorable to the prosecution, we find a rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the charges proven beyond a reasonable doubt.

Specifically, [Isaac] purchased an inordinate amount of pseudoephedrine in the months prior to August 12, 2014. Testimony of [her friend's husband] at trial established [Isaac] used the basement in the home, including doing laundry there. Items consistent with the manufacture of methamphetamine were discovered in the basement. The liquid from the one-pot cook method taken from the home subsequently tested positive for methamphetamine. Viewing the evidence in a light most favorable to the prosecution, we find a rational trier of fact could find beyond a reasonable doubt Appellant knew about and participated in the manufacture of methamphetamine and possessed chemicals necessary for the manufacture of methamphetamine * * *.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 58.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-133\">\n   {\u00b6 73} Appellant's convictions, like Isaac's, are based on circumstantial evidence entirely. Appellant's intent was proved by circumstantial evidence. Appellant, like Isaac, had an extensive purchase history of pseudoephedrine products, and like Isaac, purchased with a friend. Like Isaac, who had control of the basement where she was staying and the one-pot method was discovered, Appellant had custody and control of Kinzer's car and the discarded one-pot method. We reiterate the jury was in the best position to observe the witnesses and evaluate their credibility. Having reviewed the entire record, weighed the entirely circumstantial evidence, and considered the credibility of the witnesses, we do not find this to be the exceptional case where the evidence weighs heavily against conviction. The evidence supports the finding that Appellant\n   had engaged in the manufacture of methamphetamine, along with the illegal assembly and possession of one or more chemicals necessary to manufacture methamphetamine. Therefore his conviction is not against the manifest weight of the evidence. Furthermore, having found his conviction is not against the weight of the evidence, we necessarily find that it is supported by sufficient evidence. As such, we overrule Appellant's second assignment of error and affirm the judgment of the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-134\">\n   ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR THREE\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-135\">\n   {\u00b6 74} Appellant argues the testimony by the Thomas Kelley, the pharmacist for Walmart in Waverly, about the common practice of Scioto County individuals coming to Pike County to purchase pseudoephedrine and other chemicals commonly used to manufacture methamphetamine should have been excluded under Evid.R. 403(A).

LEGAL ANALYSIS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-139\">\n   {\u00b6 76} In this case, the prosecutor had asked Kelley, the pharmacist: \"Are there products that perform the legitimate function that don't contain the chemical that can be converted to meth?\" The pharmacist explained there is another product the pharmacy could provide which is not easily broken down into methamphetamine. The pharmacist explained that many times, purchasers are not deterred by the recommendation, presumably because they are wanting to obtain pseudoephedrine for an illegal purpose. The pharmacist continued:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-140\">\n   \"Well, unfortunately we-you know, we do see many folks coming in from Scioto County to our pharmacy. And-I say that because I've actually visually saw Scioto County driver's license, non-driver's and-and they will come in and ask for pseudoephedrine or 12 hour decongestant.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-141\">\n   {\u00b6 77} At this point, defense counsel objected and was overruled. Kelley continued:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-142\">\n   \"Typically on a-and I work five days a week typically. It's not uncommon for us in a day's time at our Waverly Walmart we will probably have 40-30 to 40 people come in asking for 12 hour decongestant. Typically out of that 30- to 40 half, if not more than half, will be Scioto County residents. And they are coming to us requesting-I've actually visually seen-as I was sitting on my lunch break one day it's-it's so apparent-\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-143\">\n   {\u00b6 78} Shortly thereafter, defense counsel interposed another objection which was overruled. Kelley continued:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-144\">\n   \"Well many times and these are-these are-what makes me understand the process more readily, these are not patients. First of all, they have to present a driver's license to us that has to be legal. Many times these folks that present\n   them, we ask-we verify their address with them. They won't know what their address is on their\n   <extracted-citation index=\"151\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=921%20N.E.2d%20276\">\n    ID.\n   </extracted-citation>\n   They are not patients. They don't have prescript-they're not getting prescriptions from our pharmacy. So they don't have an established relationship with our pharmacy.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-145\">\n   {\u00b6 79} Counsel again objected and was overruled. The State clarified that Kelley was not testifying, in particular, about Appellant, but was \"generally speaking\" of what he observed as a pharmacist. The State now argues that the pharmacist's testimony was rationally based upon the pharmacist's perception and was helpful to the jury in the determination of the reasons a Scioto County resident, such as Appellant, would go to Pike County to purchase pseudoephedrine. Citing Evid.R. 701, the State argues this testimony was admissible. The pharmacist went on to testify as to the federal regulations Walmart is required to follow before they can sell pseudoephedrine products.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-146\">\n   {\u00b6 80} Since the adoption of the Rules of Evidence, both on the state and federal levels, many courts have used an Evid.R. 701 analysis and have allowed lay witnesses to testify about, for example, the identity of a drug.\n   <em>\n    State v.

Evid.R. 701 provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-147\">\n   \"If the witness is not testifying as an expert, his testimony in the form of opinions or inferences is limited to those opinions or inferences which are (1) rationally based on the perception of the witness and (2) helpful to a clear understanding of his testimony or the determination of a fact in issue.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-148\">\n   \"[C]ourts have permitted lay witnesses to express their opinions in areas in which it would ordinarily be expected that an expert must be qualified under Evid.R. 702. Although these cases are of a technical nature in that they allow lay opinion testimony on a subject outside the realm of common knowledge, they will fall within the ambit of the rules requirement that a lay witness's opinion be rationally based on firsthand observations and helpful in determining a fact in issue. These cases are not based on specialized knowledge within the scope of Evid.R. 702, but rather are based upon a layperson's personal knowledge and experience.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-149\">\n   {\u00b6 81} In the case sub judice, the pharmacist had been identifying Appellant and Kinzer's purchase records when the testimony occurred. The pharmacist went on to testify about the NPLEX system and Walmart's role in keeping these required records. We find the additional testimony about Kelley's observation that individuals, with no patient relationship to the Walmart pharmacy, often come from Scioto County to Pike County to purchase pseudoephedrine, is helpful to an understanding of why such meticulous records are required by the government and kept by Walmart.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-150\">\n   {\u00b6 82} Yet, we agree that Appellant makes a valid argument. While we have found no cases where this type of testimony from a pharmacist or pharmacy employee has been challenged, we liken Kelley's testimony about the frequent practice of individuals coming from out of county to purchase pseudoephedrine to testimony about defendants being observed or arrested in \"high crime areas.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-151\">\n   {\u00b6 83} In\n   <em>\n    State v.

Furthermore, we do not perceive this evidence as the sole evidence the jury relied upon in convicting Appellant. As discussed in our resolution of assignment of error two above, the circumstantial evidence of Appellant's near daily use of methamphetamine; the evidence of Appellant's possession and control of Kinzer's vehicle, to the exclusion of anyone but Kinzer, where he often used methamphetamine; Appellant's own pseudoephedrine purchase records; his appearance on the Walmart surveillance video on the relevant purchase dates, Kinzer's denial that she discarded the trash bags containing the \"one-pot\" method; and Kinzer's denial of knowledge of the Mello Yello bottle and syringe, along with her denial that she cut the corner of the ice compress, all point to Appellant's knowledge and intent to manufacture methamphetamine. As such, we find ample evidence that Appellant would have been convicted, had Kelley's testimony been excluded. We do not find it highly prejudicial nor an abuse of the trial court's discretion by allowing it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-154\">\n   {\u00b6 86} For the foregoing reasons, we overrule Appellant's third assignment of error and affirm the judgment of the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-155\">\n   <strong>\n    JUDGMENT AFFIRMED.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-156\">\n   Abele, J.: Concurs in Judgment and Opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-157\">\n   Harsha, J.: Concurs in Judgment and Opinion as to Assignment of Error II; Concurs in Judgment Only as to Assignments of Error I &amp; III.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-160\">\n    Kinzer testified she has three children.
