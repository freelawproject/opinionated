His sole assignment of error is whether the trial court erred in denying his motion to suppress.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   {\u00b6 2} Finding no merit to the appeal, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    I. The Suppression Hearing\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 3} In December 2015, Thomas was indicted for having a weapon while under disability and carrying a concealed weapon.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   He pleaded not guilty to the charges. Thomas then moved to suppress the gun found on his person.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 4} On March 30, 2016, the trial court held a hearing on Thomas's motion to suppress. The following evidence was presented at the suppression hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b6 5} Officer Aaron Luther (\"Officer Luther\") of the Cuyahoga Metropolitan Housing Authority (\"CMHA\") was the state's sole witness. Officer Luther testified that he had been employed with CMHA for three years and that his rank was patrolman. His daily duties were to patrol the public housing areas throughout Cuyahoga County, Ohio and to respond to calls for services in those areas.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {\u00b6 6} On November 14, 2015, at 6:57 p.m., an anonymous female called 911 and reported that three juvenile males, approximate ages of 13 or 14 years old, were in a parking lot with bricks in their hands \"looking to do mischief.\" The reported location was in the back parking lot of East 71st Street and Wade Park, Cleveland, Ohio, where the Addison high rises and family estates are located. Officer Luther testified that the area of East 71st Street and Wade Park was known to be a \"rough area\" that was the subject of many service calls.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   {\u00b6 7} Officer Luther responded to the call and received the following dispatch narrative, \"female advised the [sic] 3 juv males are in the back parking lot with bricks. 1 male blk jacket.\" Due to other calls, however, Officer Luther did not respond to this particular call until 7:36 p.m-approximately 40 minutes after the dispatcher received the 911 call. Officer Luther was alone in responding to the call, with the exception of two female ride-alongs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   {\u00b6 8} When Officer Luther approached the area of East 71st Street and Wade Park, he noticed an African American male who had a \"hat on or something covering his head.\" The person he saw was Thomas. Officer Luther observed the following:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   I approached from 71st northbound to the intersection of 71st and Wade Park, which is directly parallel to our property located there, and at that time I observed a male matching the given description with either a black or-black jacket or hoodie. The male noticed my presence, began to pick up his pace.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Officer Luther testified that the significance of Thomas picking up his pace was that \"more times than not it means that they are trying to avoid any contact with us.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   {\u00b6 9} Officer Luther testified that Thomas \"proceeded across Wade Park towards the convenience store at the intersection.\" Upon this observation, Officer Luther turned his vehicle around and entered the convenience store parking lot. Officer Luther said that it was dark outside, and the parking lot had poor lighting conditions. Officer Luther testified that after he pulled into the parking lot, \"[I] exited my vehicle, and asked [Thomas] if I could speak to him for a moment. He turned around and began to walk towards me and had both of his hands in his jacket. I asked him at that time for officer safety if he'd remove his hands for me, and he very easily complied.\" Officer Luther testified that Thomas's hands in his jacket raised a concern because \"given the nature, it could be indicative of trying to conceal something.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   {\u00b6 10} Officer Luther also said that Thomas \"readily approached\" him by walking eight to ten feet towards Officer Luther. Officer Luther asked Thomas where he was coming from and where he was going. Thomas answered that he \"was coming from visiting a friend or a family member that lived in the-in the estate\n   that he was walking out of\" and that he was walking to the convenience store. Officer Luther testified that Thomas \"was seemingly okay with talking to\" him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   {\u00b6 11} Then, \"[Officer Luther] asked if [he] could pat [Thomas] down and if he had any weapons on him, and [Thomas] quickly told [Officer Luther] that he-he did have a small caliber pistol on him.\" Officer Luther testified that he asked Thomas for a pat-down because of \"officer safety.\" In response, Thomas admitted that he had a gun.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   {\u00b6 12} After Thomas disclosed he had a gun, Officer Luther immediately secured him and \"conducted the patdown.\" Officer Luther recovered a fully loaded .22 caliber revolver and a small amount of marijuana.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   {\u00b6 13} From the dispatch log, the entire encounter between Officer Luther and Thomas took approximately 25 seconds. Officer Luther never activated his overhead lights and he never pulled out his gun.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   {\u00b6 14} Officer Luther admitted that the only description that matched the dispatch log was that Thomas was a male wearing a black jacket. Thomas was not a juvenile-he was 33 years old with a mustache and beard. Likewise, Thomas was not with any other individuals, he had no brick in his hand, and he was not in the parking lot identified by the 911 caller.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   {\u00b6 15} After reviewing the evidence, exhibits, and case law, the trial court denied Thomas's motion to suppress. The trial court found that Officer Luther \"observed the defendant at that location in close proximity to where the caller identified the juvenile[.]\" The trial court also found that Officer Luther:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   believed through the testimony that the defendant did match the description from the caller and asked the defendant to take his hands out of his pocket and asked him if he had a weapon. At that time he indicated he didn't need to pat him down, and so also in looking at the totality of the circumstances surrounding this stop, it appears to have been a consensual encounter with one police officer who did approach.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   {\u00b6 16} After the trial court denied the motion to suppress, Thomas pleaded no contest to the indictment as charged. At sentencing, the trial court merged Count 1, having a weapon while under disability, with Count 2, carrying a concealed weapon, and imposed a sentence of two years of community control sanctions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   {\u00b6 17} On appeal, Thomas raises a single assignment of error:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   The trial court erred in overruling appellant's motion to suppress where the search violates appellant's rights against unreasonable search and seizure under the Fourth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution and Section 14, Article 1 of the Ohio Constitution.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

Analysis\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   {\u00b6 26} Thomas first argues that the stop and search by Officer Luther violated his Fourth Amendment rights because the description of the \"suspects\" by the 911 caller was \"so general and poor\" that there were no grounds for an investigative\n   <em>\n    Terry\n   </em>\n   stop or search for weapons. In support of this argument, Thomas cites to\n   <em>\n    State v. Stewart\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3875870\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ohio-app-3d/193/716/\">\n    193 Ohio App.3d 716\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2011-Ohio-2910\">\n    2011-Ohio-2910\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=953%20N.E.2d%20886\">\n    953 N.E.2d 886\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   {\u00b6 27} After review, we find\n   <em>\n    Stewart\n   </em>\n   inapplicable. In\n   <em>\n    Stewart\n   </em>\n   , there was no question that a seizure of the defendant's person took place. The issue was whether the officers had articulated sufficient facts to establish a reasonable suspicion of criminal activity, which would justify a seizure of the defendant; they did not.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   {\u00b6 28} Here, we agree with Thomas that Officer Luther did not have an articulable reasonable suspicion that Thomas was involved in or about to be involved in criminal activity. Thomas failed to meet the majority of the identifying characteristics of the suspect identified by the 911 caller (other than being a male with a black jacket). Thomas was not a juvenile, he had a mustache and beard, he did not have a brick in his hand, and he was not with any other individuals. And when Officer Luther saw him, Thomas was not doing anything wrong or suspicious. Thomas's reliance on\n   <em>\n    Stewart,\n   </em>\n   however, is misplaced because the issue in the present case is whether there was a seizure at all. If there was, then we would agree with Thomas that Officer Luther violated his Fourth Amendment rights.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   {\u00b6 29} Thomas then argues that the facts prove that he was not free to leave when Officer Luther asked him questions and, therefore, there was no consensual encounter. Further, Thomas claims that he did not voluntarily consent to being searched.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   {\u00b6 30} In reviewing the evidence to determine whether a seizure occurred, we note that Thomas did not testify at the suppression hearing in this case. Therefore, the only evidence presented was the testimony of Officer Luther.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   {\u00b6 31} Officer Luther testified that he was alone when he initially approached Thomas in the parking lot. After Officer Luther exited his vehicle, he asked Thomas if he could speak with him. Thomas turned around, walked toward Officer Luther, and told him where he was coming from and where he was going. Thomas likewise took his hands out of his pockets when asked by Officer Luther. There is no evidence that Officer Luther used a tone of voice or language indicating that Thomas must comply with his requests. Officer Luther never pulled his gun, never activated his police lights, and never maneuvered his vehicle to block Thomas. In looking at the\n   <em>\n    Mendenhall\n   </em>\n   factors, Officer Luther did not use physical force, display a weapon, touch Thomas, use any language or tone to compel Thomas's responses, or otherwise indicate that Thomas's compliance with his requests was compelled.

The caller stated that a firearm may be present, but the caller had not seen it and did not have a description of the participants in the fight.

The officer did not use his vehicle to stop the defendant, and he did not draw his weapon. The officer then asked defendant what his name was and asked, \"hey do you mind if I pat you down real quick.\" The officer testified that the defendant said, \"sure.\" At the suppression hearing, the defendant denied consenting to the pat-down. While performing the pat-down, the officer recovered a \"baggie with multiple gel capsules with heroin.\" The trial court denied defendant's motion to suppress.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   {\u00b6 37} On appeal, the defendant in\n   <em>\n    Greene\n   </em>\n   argued that the interaction with the officer was a\n   <em>\n    Terry\n   </em>\n   stop, rather than a consensual encounter.

The juveniles were on the CMHA property in the area of East 71st Street and Wade Park.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   {\u00b6 42} After responding to the call, Officer Luther was advised that one juvenile male was wearing a black jacket.

After requesting Thomas to speak with him and for \"officer safety,\" Officer Luther requested if he could pat Thomas down and asked if he had any weapons on his person. It was revealed that Thomas had a gun in his pocket.

The officer could not justify stopping Thomas because Officer Luther arrived in the area approximately 40 minutes after the dispatched call, Thomas in no way matched the description of the juveniles, he was alone, and in a different parking lot. The fact that Thomas began to walk faster could have been for several reasons, i.e., as Officer Luther testified, \"it's a pretty\n   rough area.\" Additionally, the fact that Thomas had his hands in his pockets is insignificant because it was a November evening in the city of Cleveland.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   {\u00b6 57} Therefore, I would conclude that there were no rational inferences taken from the facts given by Officer Luther to warrant an intrusion of Thomas's rights.
