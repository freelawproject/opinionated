(\"Schwan's\") and ordering the return of the garnished funds to Schwan's. Schwan's and defendant-appellee/cross-appellant Debra Rosencrans Roberts (\"Roberts\") cross-appeal from the same judgment.

FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   {\u00b6 2} Schwan's is a corporation with a principal place of business in Minnesota and a business presence in Ohio. On December 17, 2007, Roberts, while in the course and scope of her employment with Schwan's, drove a Schwan's delivery truck into a vehicle operated by Douglas Dyer. Douglas Dyer suffered injuries in the accident. On December 15, 2009, the Dyers commenced a personal injury action against Schwan's and Roberts in the common pleas court. A Franklin County jury found Roberts and Schwan's liable to the Dyers and awarded damages of $10,988,793.11. On June 8, 2016, Judge Stephen L. McIntosh issued a judgment entry journalizing the jury verdict in favor of the Dyers in the total amount of $10,988,793.11 plus court costs.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Dyer v. Ohio Bur. of Workers' Comp\n   </em>\n   ., Franklin C.P. No. 09CVC-18581 (June 8, 2016) (\"civil action\"). The June 8, 2016 judgment entry indicates that it is not a final, appealable order. On June 9, 2016, the Dyers filed a motion for prejudgment interest pursuant to R.C. 1343.03(C). On July 7, 2016, Schwan's and Roberts (hereinafter, collectively \"Schwan's\") filed a motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict and a motion for new trial or remittitur. These post-trial motions remain pending.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 3} The Dyers commenced a separate garnishment proceeding in the common pleas court on June 16, 2016. The matter was assigned to Judge David Young.\n   <em>\n    Dyer v. Schwan's Home Serv., Inc.\n   </em>\n   , Franklin C.P. No. 16JG-20111 (\"the garnishment action\"). On July 5, 2016, the Dyers obtained notices and orders of garnishment\n   of certain funds held in Schwan's financial accounts. On July 13, 2016, Schwan's filed a request for a hearing as to each of the orders of garnishment issued by the trial court. Beginning July 26, 2016, the garnishees filed answers to the notices of garnishment and made deposits of garnished funds with the Franklin County Clerk of Courts (\"clerk\") pursuant to the trial court's July 5, 2016 orders. The clerk received total deposits of $7,856,007.62.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 4} On July 14, 2016, Schwan's filed a motion, pursuant to Civ.R. 62(A), seeking a stay of enforcement of the judgment issued in the civil action.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   On July 19, 2016, Schwan's filed a motion seeking a stay of proceedings in the garnishment action. Judge McIntosh granted the July 14, 2016 motion to stay enforcement of judgement in the civil action on July 21, 2016. The order prohibits the Dyers from \"executing or taking any actions relating to the June 8, 2016 judgment entry and the June 2, 2016 jury verdict.\" (July 21, 2016 Jgmt. Entry at 2.) Schwan's subsequently filed a motion to dismiss the garnishment proceeding on July 21, 2016 and attached to the motion a copy of Judge McIntosh's July 21, 2016 decision and entry staying enforcement of the judgment in the civil action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 5} On August 5, 2016, Judge Young issued a stay in the garnishment action conditioned on the posting of a supersedeas bond by Schwan's in an amount equal to the funds deposited with the clerk. In the August 5, 2016 entry, Judge Young ordered the clerk to return the previously garnished funds to Schwan's, but he did not dismiss the garnishment action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 6} The Dyers timely appealed to this court from the August 5, 2016 entry granting a stay in the garnishment action.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Schwan's filed a cross-appeal from the same judgment claiming that Judge Young erred by failing to dismiss the garnishment action. Thus, both the appeal and cross-appeal pertain exclusively to Judge Young's August 5, 2016 order in the garnishment action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    II. ASSIGNMENTS OF ERROR\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {\u00b6 7} The Dyers assert the following as their sole assignment of error:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   BECAUSE THE TRIAL COURT EXCEEDED THE JURISDICTIONAL AUTHORITY CONFERRED IN THIS GARNISHMENT ACTION UNDER R.C.

Pursuant to R.C. 2716.01(B), a judgment creditor, after obtaining a judgment, may garnish property other than personal earnings of a judgment debtor only through a proceeding in garnishment and only in accordance with R.C. Chapter 2716.\n   <em>\n    Broadmoor Ctr\n   </em>\n   . at \u00b6 20.\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   R.C. 2715.091(B) (\"Garnishment of property other than personal earnings of a person against whom judgment has been entered may be granted only pursuant to Chapter 2716.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   {\u00b6 12} In\n   <em>\n    Doss\n   </em>\n   , the judgment creditor, Doss, obtained a judgment against a daycare business funded by Franklin County Department of Job and Family Services (\"FCJFS\"). To satisfy the judgment, Doss sought to garnish monies FCJFS owed to the daycare business. The trial court ordered FCJFS, as garnishee, to answer and deposit \"money, property, or credits\" that it had in its possession belonging to the daycare business.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at \u00b6 2. When FCJFS refused, the trial court held it in contempt of court. This court reversed the judgment of the trial court holding that FCJFS could not be cited for contempt of the garnishment order because the trial court was without statutory authority to garnish property in the possession of a political subdivision.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at \u00b6 17.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   {\u00b6 13} This court reasoned that, pursuant to R.C. 2716.01(B), a court may issue a garnishment order only against \"property * * * in the possession of a person\" and that FCJFS, as a political subdivision of the state, is not a \"person\" for purposes of the garnishment statute.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at \u00b6 16, citing R.C. 1.59.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   This court determined that because the trial court exceeded its statutory\n   authority in issuing the garnishment order, the order was invalid.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at \u00b6 18.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   {\u00b6 14} In\n   <em>\n    Doss\n   </em>\n   , we determined that a garnishment order issued in absence of expressed statutory authority is invalid. This court reached the same conclusion in\n   <em>\n    Broadmoor Ctr\n   </em>\n   . In that case, the judgment creditor attempted to commence an action, pursuant to R.C. 2716.11, seeking to garnish property of the debtor other than wages. However, in so doing, the judgment creditor failed to comply with the notice requirements in the statute. This court determined that the \"proceedings related to the garnishment of property other than personal earnings were void due to the defective notice issued to the judgment debtor.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at \u00b6 35. In the\n   <em>\n    Broadmoor Ctr.\n   </em>\n   decision, this court noted that\n   <em>\n    Doss\n   </em>\n   directs this court to strictly construe garnishment statutes.\n   <em>\n    Broadmoor Ctr.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 21.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   {\u00b6 15} Here, the Dyers attempted to commence a garnishment proceeding pursuant to R.C. 2716.11.

After the trial court denied defendant's motions but before the trial court decided the plaintiff's prejudgment interest motion, defendant appealed. The Sixth District Court of Appeals dismissed the appeal for lack of a final, appealable order.

But trial courts often enter judgment before parties file these types of post-trial motions, and during the window of time between the entry of that judgment and the filing of one of these motions, one of the parties may choose to appeal from an order that appears to be final at the time it was entered. The current amendments are designed to avoid the jurisdictional and procedural uncertainty that results from this situation.\n   <em>\n    Now, the appellate court has the authority to remand the matter for a ruling on the post-judgment motion, rather than dismissing the appeal.\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   (Emphasis added.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   {\u00b6 23} The 2014 amendment to App.R. 4(B)(2) acknowledges the decision of the Supreme Court in\n   <em>\n    Miller.\n   </em>\n   The amended rule deviates from the\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   decision only to the extent that the amended rule requires the appellate court, on suggestion of any of the parties, to stay the appeal and remand the matter to the trial court for a ruling on the pending motion for prejudgment interest, rather than dismissing the appeal. Contrary to the Dyers' contention, the amendment does not abrogate the basic holding in\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   that a timely and appropriate motion for prejudgment interest deprives a journalized jury verdict of finality. The use of the term \"otherwise final\" in the amended rule and \"appears to be final\" in the staff notes evidences the continued viability of the\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   decision. In our opinion, the\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   decision is still the law of Ohio following the amendments to App.R. 4(B)(2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   {\u00b6 24} Because\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   remains the law in Ohio, we hold that the trial court did not have statutory authority to issue a valid garnishment order in this case. The journalized jury verdict in the civil action was not a final order and, therefore, not a \"judgment\" within the meaning of Civ.R. 54 and R.C. 2505.02. Because the journalized jury verdict here is not a \"judgment\" as that term is defined in Civ.R. 54(A) and R.C. 2505.02, no garnishment action under R.C. 2716.11 could lawfully commence.\n   <em>\n    See Doss\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    Broadmoor Ctr.\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    Nwabara.\n   </em>\n   Because the garnishment action was not properly commenced, the trial court erred by failing to dismiss the garnishment action.\n   <em>\n    Aselage\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 29. Our\n   holding in this case is consistent with the clearly expressed intent of the garnishment statutes at issue, the case law from this court demanding strict compliance with the relevant garnishment statutes, and the generally accepted view that \"a non-final, interlocutory order is not capable of execution.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 28, quoting\n   <em>\n    Nwabara.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   {\u00b6 25} For the foregoing reasons, we sustain Schwan's cross-assignment of error. Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the trial court and remand the case for the trial court to issue an order vacating its August 5, 2015 order and dismissing the garnishment action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   <strong>\n    B. The Dyers' Appeal\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   {\u00b6 26} In their sole assignment of error, the Dyers argue that the trial court exceeded its statutory authority by staying the garnishment action and returning the funds previously deposited with the court. By sustaining Schwan's cross-assignment of error, however, we have determined that the trial court did not have statutory authority to issue a valid garnishment order because the judgment issued in the civil action was not a final order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   {\u00b6 27} App.R. 12(A)(1)(b) and (c) provides that this court shall \"[d]etermine the appeal on its merits on the assignments of error set forth in the briefs * * * [u]nless an assignment of error is made moot by a ruling on another assignment of error.\" Likewise, where our disposition of a cross-assignment of error renders moot the sole assignment of error raised by appellant, this court will dismiss the appeal as moot.\n   <em>\n    State v. Houston\n   </em>\n   , 10th Dist. No. 09AP-592,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2010-Ohio-4374\">\n    2010-Ohio-4374\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2010%20WL%203610594\">\n    2010 WL 3610594\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 19-20. Because we have previously determined that the garnishment action was not properly commenced and that the trial court should have dismissed the action, we need not determine whether the trial court erred by issuing a stay. Our ruling on Schwan's cross-assignment of error renders moot the Dyers' sole assignment of error.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at \u00b6 19.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   {\u00b6 28} Having determined that the Dyers' sole assignment of error is moot, we dismiss the Dyers' appeal as moot.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 20.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   <strong>\n    V. CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   {\u00b6 29} Having sustained Schwan's cross-assignment of error and having dismissed Dyers' appeal as moot, we reverse the judgment of the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas and remand this matter for the trial court to vacate its August 5, 2015 order and to issue an order dismissing the action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   <em>\n    Judgment reversed\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    cause remanded with instructions.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   DORRIAN and HORTON, JJ., concur.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-70\">\n    Civ.R. 62(A) provides as follows: \"In its discretion and on such conditions for the security of the adverse party as are proper, the court may stay the execution of any judgment or stay any proceedings to enforce judgment pending the disposition of a motion for a new trial * * * or of a motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict.\" Civ.R. 62 does not provide for a stay pending the disposition of a motion for prejudgment interest.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-71\">\n    On September 2, 2016, after filing their direct appeal, the Dyers commenced an original action in this court seeking writs of mandamus and prohibition.
