JONES, SR., J.:\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   {\u00b6 1} Defendant-appellant, Andre Lewis, appeals the trial court's denial of his motion to suppress and his conviction and sentence for trafficking of drugs with a one-year firearm specification, possession of drugs with a one-year firearm specification, carrying concealed weapons, improperly handling firearms in a motor vehicle, having weapons while under disability, and possession of criminal tools. For the reasons that follow, we affirm Lewis's convictions but vacate his sentence and remand for resentencing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   {\u00b6 2} In 2016, Lewis was charged with the crimes as stated above. He filed a motion to suppress, which the trial court denied after a full hearing. The matter proceeded to a bench trial. The following pertinent evidence was presented at the suppression hearing and bench trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 3} Cleveland police officers Patty Katynski and Joshua McCoy were on patrol when they conducted a random registration check on a Chevrolet Equinox. The check revealed that the owner of the car had a suspended license. In comparing the registration picture to the driver of the vehicle, they determined that Lewis was both the driver and owner of the car.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 4} The officers conducted a traffic stop and told Lewis he was under arrest for driving with a suspended license. The officers asked Lewis's passenger for identification and found out that his passenger also did not have a valid driver's license;\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   therefore, the car would have to be towed because no one was present who could legally drive it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 5} Officer McCoy searched Lewis pursuant to arrest and found a small folded piece of paper in Lewis's front pants pocket; Lewis told Officer McCoy that it was \"Molly,\" a street name for the drug MDMA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b6 6} Officer McCoy testified that departmental policy requires him to search a vehicle prior to towing it. Pursuant to the policy he must determine if a car contains a battery, radiator, engine, air conditioning, radio, tape player, CD player, keys, and transmission, and he cannot have the car towed until he has completed the Vehicle/Tow Supplement Form.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {\u00b6 7} Officer McCoy searched the car and testified that he \"popped\" the hood as part of his search for the battery, radiator, and engine. He saw, in plain view, the handle of a handgun sticking up from the hood next to a damaged air filter. Officer Katynski also observed the gun next to the air filter. The officers radioed for a supervisor to take photos of the gun, and the gun was removed from the car. The gun was loaded and operable. The officers also located a jar of suspected marijuana and plastic baggies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   {\u00b6 8} Lewis admitted to the police that the contraband and gun were his.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   {\u00b6 9} The trial court found Lewis guilty of all charges and specifications. During the sentencing hearing, the court told Lewis that it was sentencing him to a total of three years in prison. The sentencing journal entry also stated that Lewis was being sentenced to a total of three years in prison by running the three-year firearm specification concurrent to the crime of having weapons while under disability.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   {\u00b6 10} Lewis now appeals, raising the following assignments of error for our review:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   I. The trial court erred by denying Appellant's motion to suppress where the search of his vehicle exceeded the scope of a permissible warrantless search in violation of his constitutional rights.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   II. The trial court erred by denying Appellant's Crim.R. 29 motions because Appellant's convictions were based on insufficient evidence.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   III. Appellant's convictions were against the manifest weight of the evidence.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   IV. Appellant's sentence is contrary to law and was imposed in violation of his Sixth Amendment rights.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   {\u00b6 11} In the first assignment of error, Lewis argues that the trial court erred in denying his motion to suppress.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   {\u00b6 12} This court reviews a decision on a suppression motion under a mixed standard of review. \"In a motion to suppress, the trial court assumes the role of trier of fact and is in the best position to resolve questions of fact and evaluate witness credibility.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

In this assignment of error, Lewis solely focuses on the gun that was found as a result of the inventory search and the statements he made to the police following its discovery.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   {\u00b6 16} In his motion to suppress challenging the validity of the inventory search of his vehicle and on appeal, Lewis argues that the inventory search was (1) a pretextual search concealing an investigatory police motive; (2) conducted outside the scope of the limited exception of an inventory search; and (3) was not part of any standardized police procedure. In ruling on the motion to suppress, the trial court disagreed, ultimately determining that the search was lawful pursuant to the inventory exception.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   {\u00b6 17} Lewis claims that Officer McCoy's decision to search the hood of the vehicle was investigative, rather than administrative, because the officer was unable to point to specific police policy that required him to search under the hood of a car prior to towing it and because he testified that he commonly finds weapons under the hood of vehicles he searches.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   {\u00b6 18} To support his position, Lewis cites this court's decision in\n   <em>\n    State v. Woods\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2012-Ohio-5509\">\n    2012-Ohio-5509\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=982%20N.E.2d%201305\">\n    982 N.E.2d 1305\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 24 (8th Dist.), where this court upheld a trial court's granting of a motion to suppress based on facts that Lewis claims are similar to this case. In\n   <em>\n    Woods\n   </em>\n   , two Cleveland police officers visually paced the defendant for two blocks and determined he was exceeding the posted speed limit. The officers conducted a traffic stop, patted the defendant down, found a bag of marijuana on his person, and found additional marijuana in the trunk of the car. As part of the search incident to tow, one of the officers lifted the hood of the defendant's car, \"[j]ust to make sure everything's there that's supposed to be there.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at \u00b6 8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   {\u00b6 19} The trial court found, and this court agreed, that the police lacked probable cause for the initial stop based on their visual estimation of the defendant's speed and, therefore, the ensuing search of his person and vehicle were illegal.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 24. This court also deferred to the trial court's findings and conclusions that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   the \"[t]estimony of the officers that the search was an inventory search of the vehicle was tantamount to a tow is disingenuous and merely a pretext for the claimed inventory,\" and \"the search of the trunk and most [s]uspiciously, the hood, along with the officer's failure to list all of the vehicle's contents on the inventory list suggests that the search of the vehicle was neither incidental to a tow nor for the purposes of inventory.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 25.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   {\u00b6 20} This court concluded that the case was \"a classic example of a police officer's intentional use of an unlawful traffic stop * * * for the sole purpose of conducting a fishing expedition for evidence of another crime, and a tailored script at the motion to suppress hearing to justify the stop and subsequent searches.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   {\u00b6 21} Contrary to Lewis's argument,\n   <em>\n    Woods\n   </em>\n   is distinguishable from this case. In\n   <em>\n    Woods\n   </em>\n   , the stop itself was illegal. Here, Lewis is not challenging the initial stop. But like\n   <em>\n    Woods\n   </em>\n   , we defer to the trial court who judged the credibility of the witnesses. (\"Even if we found that the officers validly stopped Woods for speeding, the trial court serves as the trier of fact and is the primary judge of the credibility of the witnesses.\"\n   <em>\n    Woods\n   </em>\n   at\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   {\u00b6 22} Officer McCoy testified that he conducts an inventory search because \"when we tow that vehicle we're responsible for that vehicle. And let's say there was personal items that were valuable and if it wasn't listed and it ended up missing, we would be responsible for it.\" Officer McCoy explained that Lewis's car had to be towed because there was no one present who could legally drive it and it had to be removed from the roadway. He further testified that once he completed the inventory of the interior of the car, he \"had to confirm there was a battery and all equipment underneath the hood of the vehicle,\" that it was \"standard\" to do so, and that for every vehicle he tows \"that's the last thing that I do is inventory underneath the hood.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   {\u00b6 23} Contrary to Lewis's assertion that the officers were unable to point to any specific police policy that requires him to search under the hood of a car prior to towing it, it was the defense that entered that policy itself into evidence. Defense Exhibit A, GPO\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   8.2.01, revised May 30, 2003, stated, in part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   <strong>\n    PURPOSE\n   </strong>\n   : To establish guidelines for towing or releasing motor vehicles\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   <strong>\n    POLICY\n   </strong>\n   : The Cleveland Division of Police shall ensure that motor vehicles are properly towed.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   <strong>\n    PROCEDURES:\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   I. Vehicle Tow Supplement\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   A. Use the\n   <em>\n    Vehicle/Tow Supplement Form\n   </em>\n   (Appendix A) to tow privately owned vehicles.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   {\u00b6 24} The state entered the Vehicle/Tow Supplement Form from the incident into evidence. The form contains several sections. The section titled \"Tow Information\" has check boxes to record the condition of the car and property inventory. The section titled \"Vehicle Parts\" contains check boxes for \"battery,\" \"radiator,\" \"engine,\" \"a/c,\" \"radio,\" \"tape,\" \"keys,\" and \"trans.\" (transmission). The officers checked boxes for engine, keys, and trans., completed the form, and signed and dated it. On cross-examination, Officer McCoy testified that he completed the tow form \"to determine 'whether all the equipment that we're required to list on the tow sheet was there.' And on the tow sheet, [equipment under the hood is] listed.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   {\u00b6 25} Thus, based on the GPO and Vehicle/Tow Supplement Form the parties entered into evidence and the testimony provided at trial, the officers were justified in checking the area under the hood as part of the inventory search on Lewis's car before it was towed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   {\u00b6 26} In light of these facts, the trial court did not err in denying the motion to suppress. The first assignment of error is overruled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   {\u00b6 27} In the second assignment of error, Lewis argues that his convictions were not supported by sufficient evidence. In the third assignment of error, he argues that his convictions were against the manifest weight of the evidence. Although the concepts of manifest weight and sufficiency of the evidence involve different standards\n   of review, we discuss them together because the evidence is the same for both.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   {\u00b6 28} Crim.R. 29 mandates that the trial court issue a judgment of acquittal where the state's evidence is insufficient to sustain a conviction for the offense; Crim.R. 29(A) and a sufficiency of the evidence review require the same analysis.\n   <em>\n    State v.

As to the firearm specifications, Lewis claims that there was insufficient evidence that the gun found under the hood of his car was within close enough proximity of him when he was arrested to qualify under R.C. 2941.141(A).

Thus, the evidence is sufficient to meet the elements of the firearm specifications.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   {\u00b6 32} Lewis also states that there was insufficient evidence that he was trafficking in drugs because of the small amount of drugs found on him and the police did\n   not see him drug trafficking. But Officer McCoy testified that the police recovered a gun, marijuana, MDMA, a scale and plastic baggies, and in his training and experience a gun is used for protection while someone is selling drugs, a scale is used to weigh the narcotics, and the baggies are used to package the narcotics for sales.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   {\u00b6 33} In light of the above facts, we find sufficient evidence to sustain the convictions and, further, that the convictions were not against the manifest weight of the evidence. Therefore, the second and third assignments of error are overruled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   {\u00b6 34} In the fourth assignment of error, Lewis challenges the sentence imposed by the trial court. We find merit to this assignment of error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   {\u00b6 35} During the sentencing hearing, the trial court stated that it was imposing a total term of three years in prison, running the firearm specification concurrent to the underlying count and the other counts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   {\u00b6 36} The sentencing journal entry states as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-58\">\n   The court imposes a prison sentence at the Lorain Correctional Institution of 3 year(s). The 1 year firearm specification in Counts 1 and 2 merge for purposes of sentencing. State elects to sentence on the firearm specification on Count 1. Defendant sentenced to 1 year on firearm specification to be served prior to and consecutive to 10 month sentence on Counts 1; 10 months on Count 2; 1 year on Counts 3 and 4; 3 years on Count 5 and 10 months on Count 6. Sentences to run concurrent to each other for a total confinement of 3 years.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   {\u00b6 37} R.C. 2929.14(C)(1)(a) provides that if a mandatory prison term is imposed for a firearm specification, that prison term \"shall\" run \"consecutively to and prior to any prison term imposed for the underlying felony * * * and consecutively to any other prison term or mandatory prison term previously or subsequently imposed upon the offender.\" Thus, the firearm specification must run prior to and consecutive to all other counts. The trial court sentenced Lewis to three years for having weapons while under disability. Because the firearm specification in Count 1 must run prior to and consecutive to his three-year sentence on Count 5, his actual sentence totaled four years in prison. The state concedes the error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   {\u00b6 38} Again, at the sentencing hearing, the trial court told Lewis it was sentencing him to three years in prison by running the one-year firearm specification concurrent to the other counts, but, by operation of law, the firearm specification must run consecutive to his other convictions. The journal entry stated that the firearm specification was to run prior to and consecutive to the other counts; however, it also stated the total prison sentence was to be three years in prison.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   {\u00b6 39} Pursuant to R.C. 2953.08(G)(2), this court may \"increase, reduce, or otherwise modify a sentence that is appealed under this section or may vacate the sentence and remand the matter to the sentencing court for resentencing\" if we clearly and convincing find that the sentence is \"otherwise contrary to law.\" R.C. 2953.08(G)(2)(b). We find that Lewis's sentence is contrary to law. Thus, under\n   R.C. 2953.08(G)(2), we vacate Lewis's sentence and remand for resentencing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   {\u00b6 40} Convictions affirmed; sentence vacated and remanded for resentencing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   SEAN C.
