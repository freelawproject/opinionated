STEWART, J.:\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   {\u00b6 1} Plaintiff-appellant Anthony Smith sold annuity policies as an agent for defendant-appellee National Western Life Insurance Company. After National Western settled a lawsuit brought by one of Smith's clients, it terminated Smith's agency contract and charged him back for the commissions it paid him on that account under Smith's personal guaranty. Smith filed for bankruptcy and a third party satisfied the charge-back. National Western listed Smith's name with Vector One, an insurance industry service that provides agent screening tools to insurance companies, such as indicating that an agent, or potential agent, has a debit balance with another insurance company.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   {\u00b6 2} Claiming that publication of the debt was false because the debt had been discharged in bankruptcy and otherwise satisfied, Smith raised claims for defamation and tortious interference with prospective economic advantage, claiming that he had been denied a position with a different issuer of annuities because of his listing with Vector One.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 3} The court dismissed the defamation claim as barred by the statute of limitations. It granted National Western summary judgment on the tortious interference claim because Smith did not sufficiently identify a business relationship with which National Western had interfered, nor did he sufficiently identify damages caused by National Western.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   I. Dismissal of Defamation Claim\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 4} Smith first argues that the court erred by granting National Western's motion to dismiss the defamation claim on grounds that he did not file his claim within the one-year statute of limitations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 5} The tort of defamation has a one-year statute of limitations.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   R.C. 2305.11(A). In paragraph 14 of his complaint, Smith alleged that National Western first reported the debt to Vector One \"later in 2010.\" Smith filed his complaint on April 6, 2015. These facts conclusively show that Smith did not file his complaint within one year of publication to Vector One.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Civ.R. 12(B)(6) ;\n   <em>\n    Doe v.

He argued, however, that dismissal was premature because \"[w]ithout discovery Plaintiff cannot determine how often the report was made to a third party, the nature of the report, how often it was updated and the extent of the accuracy of the report.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=849%20N.E.2d%20268\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {\u00b6 7} Smith sought and received three extensions of time in which to respond to the motion to dismiss the complaint: the first motion gave no reason why he needed an extension of time; the other two were based on counsel's workload and preexisting obligations that prevented timely filing a brief in opposition to the motion to dismiss. None of the three motions for an extension of time were based on the need for additional time in which to conduct discovery and raise substantive claims in opposition to the motion to dismiss. The claim that counsel needed additional time to conduct discovery was never raised before Smith filed his brief in opposition to the motion to dismiss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   {\u00b6 8} In any event, Smith was not entitled to discovery in order to seek out facts to defeat a motion to dismiss. A Civ.R. 12(B)(6) motion to dismiss is a challenge to the facts pleaded in the complaint. For that reason, a Civ.R. 12(B)(6) motion cannot be decided on facts that are not contained in the complaint.\n   <em>\n    State ex rel. Findlay Publishing Co. v.

Additional facts would have no bearing on the merits of the motion to dismiss. Under certain circumstances, a motion to dismiss can be converted into a motion for summary judgment, but only when the \"motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted presents matters outside the pleading and such matters are not excluded by the court [.]\" Civ.R. 12(B). In other words, conversion is possible only if the movant raises matters outside the complaint in a motion to dismiss-the nonmoving party cannot raise additional facts in response to a motion to dismiss with the hope of having the motion converted to a motion for summary judgment. Smith's only option was to seek leave to amend the complaint under Civ.R. 15 or voluntarily dismiss the case without prejudice under Civ.R. 41(A) and refile it with additional facts. Having done neither, he has failed to show that the court erred by dismissing the defamation claim.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   II.

Kienow alleged that her supervisor placed what she believed was \"false, negative and misleading information\" in her personnel file. She claimed that her manager agreed that the information should be removed from her personnel file, but it was not. Kienow resigned her position in protest.

The trial court granted Civ.R. 12(B)(6) dismissals on both claims for being outside their respective statutes of limitations. The court of appeals upheld the dismissal of the defamation claim, but found that the trial court erred by dismissing the tortious interference claim. Acknowledging that trial courts could look beyond the face of the claim to determine its true subject matter, it held that the tortious interference claim was not really a defamation claim subject to a shorter limitations period. It found that a tortious interference claim \"goes beyond damage to reputation[,]\" and did not hinge on disseminating information but on \"hindering a prospective and known business relationship[.]\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 13. The court of appeals concluded that a tortious interference\n   claim \"is not of the same nature as a defamation claim.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   {\u00b6 17} The facts in\n   <em>\n    Kienow\n   </em>\n   are distinguishable because the defamation and tortious interference in that case were based on two different acts: the defamation claim consisted of allegedly false information contained in Kienow's personnel file; the tortious interference claim consisted of remarks made to the hiring manager of a prospective employer more than one year later. For this reason, the First District held that the tortious interference claim was specifically intended to hinder a prospective and known business relationship. In this case, there is no factual dispute that the defamation and tortious interference claims arose from a single act-National Western's listing Smith's name with Vector One.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   {\u00b6 18} We are aware that when ruling on National Western's motion for summary judgment, the court stated that it would not analyze any arguments related to the statute of limitations with respect to the tortious interference claim. Nevertheless, there is no question that Smith's tortious interference claim was based on the same conduct underlying the defamation claim. Because the claims were based on the same conduct, we find as a matter of law for purposes of Civ.R. 56 that the one-year statute of limitations for defamation applied to both claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   {\u00b6 19} Even were we to address the merits of Smith's assignment of error relating to the summary judgment on the tortious interference claim, we would find no error. Smith offered no evidence to show a genuine issue of material fact with respect to National Western's privilege to list his name with Vector One.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   {\u00b6 20} The elements of a claim for tortious interference with a business relationship or contract are: (1) a business relationship or contract; (2) the defendant's knowledge of the relationship or contract; (3) the defendant's intentional or improper action taken to prevent a contract formation, procure a contractual breach, or terminate a business relationship; (4) a lack of privilege; and (5) resulting damages.\n   <em>\n    Byrne v.

One of the elements of the tort, the lack of privilege, makes it clear that some acts, while potentially falling within the definition of the tort, may not constitute improper conduct. \"[O]ne is privileged to purposely cause another not to perform a contract with a third person where he in good faith is asserting a legally protected interest of his own, which he believes will be impaired or destroyed by the performance of the contract.\"\n   <em>\n    Pearse v.

We disagree with Smith's interpretation of a bankruptcy: it discharges a debtor's liability on a debt, but it does not extinguish the underlying debt.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    FB Acquisition Prop.

Smith, despite his personal guaranty, did not personally satisfy the debt to National Western consistent with his personal guaranty. His bankruptcy is proof of that fact.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   {\u00b6 23} Smith goes on to argue that National Western wrongly listed him despite a third party having paid the charge back-he claims that the debt was fully satisfied. Smith's complaint made it clear that the third party did not pay off the debt until\n   <em>\n    after\n   </em>\n   his name was listed in the Vector One report. The tortious interference claim was based on the initial listing with Vector One, so National Western acted in furtherance of its own legally protected interest by reporting him to Vector One. In any event, the fact remains that Smith was unable to live up to his promise to personally guarantee any debts that he owed to National Western. He declared personal bankruptcy to avoid satisfying the charge back. By any measure, his listing on the Vector One report truthfully indicated that he failed to fulfill his financial obligations to National Western. On that basis, the court did not err by granting summary judgment on the tortious interference claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   {\u00b6 24} Judgment affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   MARY EILEEN KILBANE, P.J., and EILEEN T.
