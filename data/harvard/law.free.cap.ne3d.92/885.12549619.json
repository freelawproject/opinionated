Murray, appeals the judgment of the Lake County Court of Common Pleas denying his motion to suppress evidence. At issue is whether the trial court erred in finding appellant's consent to search his shoes was voluntary and in denying his motion to suppress. For the reasons that follow, we affirm and remand.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   {\u00b6 2} On July 8, 2016, appellant was indicted for possession of heroin, a felony of the fourth degree with a forfeiture specification-contraband (heroin). Appellant pled not guilty. Subsequently, he filed a motion to suppress evidence, and the trial court held a suppression hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   {\u00b6 3} The evidence revealed that on May 20, 2016, at about 10:00 a.m., Mentor Police Officer Bryan Distelrath was patrolling traffic on Emerald Court in Mentor when he saw a Pontiac Grand Prix fail to signal his turn at a stop sign before entering the Sam's Club Gas Station.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   {\u00b6 4} Officer Distelrath activated his overhead lights and siren. The driver of the Grand Prix drove into the gas station and stopped near the gas pumps. The officer exited his cruiser and approached the vehicle on the driver's side. There were four occupants in the Pontiac. None of them had a driver's license or identification card, but they all provided their names and other identifying information. The driver was Michael Murray. His girlfriend, Cortinei Andrews, was in the front\n   passenger seat. The driver's brother, appellant, was seated in the back passenger seat on the driver's side. Brandy Simmons was in the back passenger seat next to appellant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 5} While Officer Distelrath was standing at the driver's side of the vehicle talking to the occupants, he smelled the odor of alcohol coming from the vehicle and saw two open beer cans in the back seat area within appellant's reach. The officer saw that appellant was slouched down in his seat, breathing heavily, nervous, and avoided looking at the officer. Ms. Simmons appeared to be under the influence because her pupils were constricted and she looked lethargic.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 6} Officer Distelrath then left the vehicle and its occupants and returned to his cruiser to run their information through LEADS. The officer learned that the driver, Michael Murray, did not have a valid driver's license and had multiple driver's license suspensions. Appellant had no warrants for his arrest, but had a prior conviction for operating a vehicle while under the influence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 7} Officer Distelrath requested a second vehicle to provide backup, and Mentor Officer Jason Myers responded. Officer Distelrath brought Officer Myers up to date, and both officers then approached the suspect vehicle. Officer Distelrath asked Michael to step outside. Officer Distelrath told him he was being arrested for driving without a valid driver's license and handcuffed him. Michael was then secured in the back seat of Officer Distelrath's cruiser.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 8} The officers then returned to the vehicle. Officer Distelrath asked appellant to exit the car. As he did, the officer told appellant he was not under arrest. After appellant stepped out of the car, he was still acting nervously. He was breathing heavily and his hands were trembling.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b6 9} Officer Distelrath told appellant he was going to perform a pat down search. The officer testified he conducted a pat down of appellant as he was trained to do. He had appellant put his hands behind his back and, while holding onto both of appellant's hands with one hand, the officer conducted a pat down of appellant's outer clothing with his other hand to see if he had any weapons. The frisk, which lasted less than ten seconds, did not reveal any weapons or contraband.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {\u00b6 10} Officer Distelrath then released appellant's hands and asked him where they were coming from and going. Appellant said they were from Delaware County and were in Mentor visiting a friend or relative in the hospital.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   {\u00b6 11} Officer Distelrath then asked appellant if he would mind emptying his pockets real quick. Appellant said he would not mind and complied without any hesitation, showing the officers his pockets were empty.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   {\u00b6 12} Officer Myers said that when appellant exited the car, he noticed his shoes were untied and loose. As a result, after appellant showed them his pockets were empty, Officer Myers asked appellant, \"Could you just do me a quick favor? Do you mind, just take off your shoes real quick. Just take your shoes off for me.\" At that time, Officer Distelrath was standing a couple feet in front of appellant and Officer Myers was standing behind appellant a couple feet to the right of him. Neither Officer had his hands on appellant and he was still not under arrest. Appellant immediately kicked off his shoes, starting with his right shoe. The officers saw a clear plastic baggie containing a tan powdery substance, which they suspected was heroin, in his right shoe. Officer Distelrath then arrested appellant and placed him in Officer Myers' cruiser.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   {\u00b6 13} Based on our review of Officer Distelrath's and Officer Myers' dash cam video, the officers were professional, polite, and courteous and their tone was conversational and calm, not loud, demanding, or threatening at any time. Further, only about 15 minutes elapsed from the time Officer Distelrath stopped the vehicle until appellant consented to the search of his shoes. And, as Officer Myers testified, appellant was cooperative with the officers and followed all their requests without hesitation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   {\u00b6 14} Appellant did not testify at the suppression hearing and thus did not dispute the officers' testimony.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   {\u00b6 15} Following the presentation of the evidence, the trial court entered a five-page, highly-detailed judgment denying appellant's motion to suppress.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   {\u00b6 16} On or about November 19, 2016, appellant pled no contest to possession of heroin with a forfeiture specification-contraband (heroin), as charged in the indictment. The court found appellant's plea was voluntary; accepted his plea; found him guilty; and deferred sentencing. On January 9, 2017, the court sentenced appellant to two years of community control. As sanctions and conditions, he was ordered to serve 35 days in jail, with credit for 30 days time served, and to successfully complete an intensive out-patient program. Appellant appealed the trial court's judgment denying his motion to suppress evidence. For his sole assignment of error, he alleges:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   {\u00b6 17} \"The trial court erred by denying the defendant-appellant's motion to suppress in violation of his due process rights and rights against unreasonable search and seizure as guaranteed by the Fourth, Fifth, and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution and Sections 10 and 14, Article 1 of the Ohio Constitution.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   {\u00b6 18} Appellant does not challenge the propriety of the initial traffic stop or the officers' requests that he identify himself, that he step out of the car, or that he empty his pockets. Instead, appellant argues the state failed in its burden to show that he voluntarily consented to a warrantless search of his person, specifically, his shoes. Appellant also argues the officers unlawfully exceeded the scope of the Terry frisk for weapons when they had him remove his shoes. However, because the state argues on appeal (as it argued below) that the search of appellant's shoes was consensual, rather than part of the Terry frisk, the issue of whether the search of appellant's shoes was warranted as part of a frisk is irrelevant and moot. We therefore confine our analysis to whether the search of appellant's shoes was warranted as a consent search.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   {\u00b6 19} \"Appellate review of a trial court's ruling on a motion to suppress evidence presents a mixed question of law and fact.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

The car had been stopped for a turn signal violation and the driver was arrested for driving without a valid license. The fifteen minutes was not overly long and allowed the defendant to consider his situation in view of the fact that the driver was arrested and the police were clearly interested in the other passengers. [2.] Defendant's consent was given in a non-coercive setting of a large public gas station in broad daylight on a warm spring day. Numerous other customers were coming and going. [3.] There was no evidence of any threats, promises or coercive police procedures. The officers were polite, were speaking in a level, conversational tone and were not giving orders with the exception of asking the defendant to step out of the car and asking him to put his hands behind his back for a pat down search. There was no * * * rapid fire questioning of him. The pat down search lasted no more than eight or nine seconds and no handcuffs were used. At no time did the officers touch their weapons. Neither officer was excessively close to the defendant. At the time the defendant was asked to step out of his shoes, [Officer Distelrath] was about three feet in front of defendant and [Officer Myers was] about three feet behind the defendant's right side. Again, the officers' tone of voice was conversational. [4.]-[5.] Defendant was cooperative with the officers and did not question why he had to submit to a pat down search or why the officers wanted him to empty his pockets or step out of his shoes. He quietly and promptly complied with the officers' requests. [6.] No evidence was presented concerning his awareness of his right to refuse to consent to a search. He did not have an extensive criminal history and had only one conviction for operating a vehicle while impaired, a charge that would have resulted in his arrest during the traffic stop. He was the brother of the driver who did have an extensive criminal record. [7.] No evidence was presented concerning defendant's education and intelligence.

In\n   <em>\n    Carothers\n   </em>\n   , the appellate court affirmed the trial court's finding that the defendant's consent was not voluntary. In that case, the officer told the defendant, who was a passenger in a vehicle that had been stopped for a traffic violation, \"Now you have to take your shoes off.\" The officer testified the defendant seemed reluctant to do so. That officer also testified, \"I guess you [could] construe [that] as an order * * *.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   {\u00b6 28} Immediately after Officer Myers asked appellant if he would mind taking off his shoes, the officer said, \"Just take your shoes off for me.\" This was not a separate exchange between the officer and appellant, but, rather, part of the officer's request. While appellant argues the officer commanded, rather than asked, him to take off his shoes, based on the totality of the circumstances, the trial court found appellant's consent to search his shoes was voluntary. Based on our review of the record, including the video of the incident, there was competent, credible evidence to support the trial court's finding. We therefore hold the trial court did not err in finding the search was consensual and in denying appellant's motion to suppress.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   {\u00b6 29} For the reasons stated in this opinion, the assignment of error is overruled.

It likewise mischaracterizes the officer's statements to Murray as \"asking\" him for consent. Its findings state in part:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   {\u00b6 39} \"The officer then asked defendant if he would 'mind emptying out your pockets real quick?' The defendant replied 'no' and did so. The assisting officer then asked the defendant if he would do him a quick favor and asked defendant if he would mind taking off his shoes 'real quick.' He further asked 'Take your shoes off please.' The defendant's shoes were not laced up and loose on his feet and he quickly stepped out of his high top sneakers. After observing what appeared to be a baggie of heroin in defendant's right shoe, the defendant was arrested * * *.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   {\u00b6 40} The trial court misstates that the exchange ends with the officer saying \"please\" instead of \"for me.\" The trial court also labels both the officer's statements to Murray regarding his shoes as \"asking\" him to take off his shoes. It also changes the officer's words and finds the officer inquired \"if he would mind\n   <em>\n    taking\n   </em>\n   off his shoes 'real quick.' \" On the dashcam video, the officer, however, is clearly heard saying \"Do you mind, just\n   <em>\n    take\n   </em>\n   off your shoes real quick,\" immediately followed by \"Just take off your shoes for me.\" Even assuming the officer began this exchange as a question, he changed midstream and makes commands. The officer's statements to Murray regarding the removal of his shoes direct him to take off his shoes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   {\u00b6 41} There are four types of sentences. At issue here is the difference between an interrogative sentence, which asks a question, and an imperative sentence, which gives a command.\n   <em>\n    Basic English Grammar\n   </em>\n   , 1996, Grebel &amp; Pogrund. An interrogative sentence always ends in a question mark.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 31. Interrogative sentences or questions usually begin with a question word, such as who, which, where, why, when, do, and how. Joerg Poehland,\n   <em>\n    Englisch-Hilfen.de\n   </em>\n   , https://www.englischhilfen.de/en/grammar/question_words.htm and https://www.ecenglish.com.learnenglish/lessons/using-do-and-does (accessed Nov. 9, 2017).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   {\u00b6 42} The officer's first statement to Murray blends an interrogative sentence with an imperative one. The officer says, \"Do you mind, just take off your shoes real quick,\" then immediately says, \"Just take\n   your shoes off for me.\" The officer begins the sentence using a question word \"do,\" but instead of completing the question and asking, \"\n   <em>\n    Do you mind taking your shoes off real quick?\n   </em>\n   \", he finishes his sentence as an imperative one, i.e., \"just take off your shoes real quick.\" The officer blended two sentence types and did not complete the question format of the sentence that he began. The officer's final statement to Murray regarding his shoes, \"Just take your shoes off for me,\" however, is a completed imperative sentence commanding Murray to remove his shoes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   {\u00b6 43} A \"command\" is defined in part as \"1. To give orders to : DIRECT. 2 To have authoritative control over : RULE.\"\n   <em>\n    Webster's II New College Dictionary\n   </em>\n   224 (1999). Whereas a \"request\" is \"1. To ask for. 2. To ask (one) to do something.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 942. And \"ask\" is defined as \"1. To put a question to.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 66. Further, there are several ways to make commands sound polite. Cambridge University Press, https://dictionary.cambridge.org/grammar/british-grammar/functions/commands-and-instructions (accessed Nov. 9, 2017). The use of the word \"please\" at the end of an imperative sentence, such as, \"brush your teeth please\" is still a command.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   {\u00b6 44} Here, Murray was a backseat passenger of the vehicle when officers removed him from the car and conducted a pat down search. There were two uniformed officers on either side of him. They secured consent to search his pockets. With regard to his shoes, however, the substance of the officer's statement twice directed Murray to take his shoes off. Murray complied with the officer's command.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   {\u00b6 45} As stated, the language employed by the officer did not reflect that Murray had a choice, and his prefacing his command with the phrases \"can you do me a quick favor,\" and \"do you mind,\" does not transform the command into a question in which Murray was presented with a choice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   {\u00b6 46} The typical reasonable person upon hearing the exchange between the officer and Murray would not objectively believe that the officer asked for permission to search his shoes; he directed Murray to remove them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   {\u00b6 47} And instead of analyzing the officer's statements to Murray using rules of grammar, the majority blindly concludes that the officer \"asked\" and received consent to search his shoes. The majority's and trial court's conclusions that consent was granted is not supported by competent credible evidence. The last words from the officer to Murray are, \"Just take your shoes off for me.\" Whether deemed a clarification or change of the immediately preceding blended sentence, this is\n   <em>\n    objectively\n   </em>\n   a command!\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   {\u00b6 48} Accordingly, the state failed to meet its burden by clear and convincing evidence that Murray gave consent to search his shoes, and as such, I dissent.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
