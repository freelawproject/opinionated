Tavtigian), appeals from a judgment of the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas, Division of Domestic Relations, granting the motion of defendant-appellee, Mark A. Foster, to terminate spousal support and denying appellant's motion for expense money. For the reasons which follow, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   {\u00b6 2} Appellant and appellee were married on November 29, 1986, and two children were born as issue of the marriage. The parties were divorced pursuant to an agreed judgment entry decree of divorce on October 2, 2009. The decree of divorce obligated appellee to pay appellant $6,500 per month in spousal support, and specified that spousal support would terminate if any of the following events occurred: the death of either party; appellant's remarriage; appellant's cohabitation with an unrelated adult; or after 116 months of payments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 3} On January 21, 2014, appellee filed a motion to terminate his spousal support\n   obligation due to appellant's cohabitation with an unrelated adult. On July 30, 2014, appellant filed a motion for expense money, asking the court to order appellee to pay the out-of-pocket expenses and attorney's fees she incurred defending against the motion to terminate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 4} On September 4, 2014, appellee filed the April 29, 2014 depositions of appellant and David Fleming, appellant's paramour. A magistrate of the domestic relations court held a hearing on the motion to terminate on September 8, 2014.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 5} Appellee is a dentist and appellant is a dental hygienist. During the parties' marriage, appellant worked as a hygienist in appellee's dental office. Fleming met appellant at the dental office in 2009 when he \"was a patient in [her] chair.\" (Sept. 8, 2014 Tr. at 18.) Appellant and Fleming began dating a couple of days after they met, and have been in a committed, exclusive relationship with each other for the last three years.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 6} Appellant is currently employed by The Ohio State University (\"OSU\") as an administrative associate in the area of oral pathology. Appellant works over 40 hours a week, receives overtime, and has employer provided health insurance and a retirement plan. Fleming is a certified public accountant, and currently is the vice president and chief financial officer of Rod's Western World. In 2013, Fleming was the chief financial officer for housing and dining at OSU. Fleming has been married, and divorced, twice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b6 7} Fleming and appellant both testified that they do not live together. In May 2012, appellant sold the marital residence and purchased a condominium located at Marblecliff Crossing Court in Columbus, Ohio. Fleming \"looked at some homes\" with appellant, and appellant used a real estate agent Fleming recommended to purchase the Marblecliff home. (Tr. at 48.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {\u00b6 8} Fleming testified that he lives with his son, daughter-in-law, and their two children in a four bedroom house located in Marengo, Ohio. Fleming bought the Marengo property in January 2014, and \"paid $115,000 down on that property,\" which was approximately half the purchase price. (Tr. at 108.) Because Fleming purchased half the property outright, Fleming's son pays the entire monthly mortgage on the property. Prior to purchasing the Marengo home, Fleming owned a two-bedroom condominium located on Chatham Lane in Columbus, Ohio.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   {\u00b6 9} Fleming testified that he goes to appellant's home after work \"three to four\" days a week, but stated that he doesn't \"normally spend the night there.\" (Tr. at 75.) At his deposition, Fleming stated that he \"[p]ossibly\" spent more than half the nights in 2013 with appellant. (Fleming Depo. at 15.) At the hearing, Fleming stated that he \"couldn't tell you\" if he spent more than half the nights in 2013 with appellant. (Tr. at 92.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   {\u00b6 10} When appellee's counsel asked appellant if Fleming spent more than half the nights in 2013 with her, appellant said \"no,\" and asserted, \"[h]ow could I possibly know the answer to that question? I don't write it down. I don't keep a diary or a journal. Nobody asked me to keep track of it.\" (Tr. at 41.) At the hearing, appellant stated that she and Fleming spend \"[p]robably an average of at least two\" nights a week together. (Tr. at 41.) At her deposition, appellant had \"[n]o idea\" how many days in a month Fleming would stay the night with her, but knew that they had \"been apart four or five days at least\" per month. (Appellant Depo. at 44, 46.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   {\u00b6 11} Appellee hired a private investigator, Kevin Wolfe, to observe appellant and Fleming. On Monday June 3, Tuesday June 4, and Wednesday June 5, 2013, the\n   investigator observed Fleming leave the Marblecliff residence around 7:00 a.m. each morning. On Monday June 17, Tuesday June 18, Wednesday June 19, and Friday June 21, 2013, the investigator again observed Fleming leave the Marblecliff residence around 7:00 a.m. each morning. Thereafter, the investigator observed the couple together at Marblecliff on seven different weekend nights.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   {\u00b6 12} Wolfe attempted to look through appellant's trash at Marblecliff during the three weeks before the hearing; however, unlike all of the other residents in the neighborhood, appellant did not place any trash outside for removal during those weeks. Wolfe conducted surveillance at Fleming's Marengo home over the 30 days before the hearing, but did not observe Fleming at the Marengo home. Wolfe was able to collect trash from the Marengo residence, but did not find \"any trash or documents related to David Fleming.\" (Tr. at 153.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   {\u00b6 13} On Thursday, June 13, 2013, Wolfe went to Fleming's Chatham Lane residence and knocked on the door. Case Kegley, who is the son of Fleming's good friend, answered the door. Wolfe and Case spoke for twenty minutes inside the Chatham Lane residence. Wolfe recorded the conversation, and the audio recording of the conversation was played during the hearing. Case informed Wolfe that he had \"a 'special deal' with Mr. Fleming, including no lease and a rent payment of $500.00 per month,\" which was \"designed to cover Mr. Fleming's mortgage payment.\" (Def.'s Ex. G.) Case informed Wolfe that Fleming \"was moving out around the time that Case needed housing,\" that Fleming had moved \"in with a woman that lived somewhere nearby within the Upper Arlington area,\" and that \"his rental of the condo was really helping both of them out.\" (Def.'s Ex. G; Mag.'s Decision at 6.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   {\u00b6 14} At the hearing, Case stated that he lied to the investigator on June 13, 2013. Case testified that Fleming had not moved out, and that Fleming had lived with him at Chatham Lane. Case explained that he lied to Wolfe about Fleming moving out because he \"just wanted [Wolfe] out of the place.\" (Tr. at 123.) However, Case admitted that he spoke with Wolfe for twenty minutes, did not ask him to leave at any point, and gave Wolfe both his phone number and Fleming's phone number.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   {\u00b6 15} Appellant and Fleming have taken several vacations together. Between 2009 and 2014, they went to Mexico, California, Florida, South Carolina, Tennessee, Vermont, Italy, and New York. Fleming stated that \"[q]uite frequently,\" they reimburse each other in cash for the expenses from their trips. (Tr. at 90.) The couple \"spend the majority of [their] holidays together,\" including Thanksgiving and Christmas, and have attended work events together. (Tr. at 61-63.) Appellant stated that Fleming has given her \"a couple sets of earrings, a necklace, a ring, [and] a computer\" as gifts, and that she has given him \"picture frames, binoculars, iPad, [and a] wool blanket.\" (Tr. at 65-66.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   {\u00b6 16} On April 24, 2015, the magistrate issued a decision granting appellee's motion to terminate spousal support and denying appellant's motion for expense money. The magistrate noted Case's testimony that he lied to the investigator, but observed that throughout the recorded conversation, Case was \"quite comfortable, conversational and friendly with Mr. Wolfe. He freely invites Mr. Wolfe into the apartment and offers him Mr. Fleming's phone number.\" (Mag.'s Decision at 5.) The magistrate found Case's in court testimony to be \"deliberately evasive, forgetful, and just not credible at all.\" (Mag.'s Decision at 6.) The magistrate noted\n   that appellant and Fleming were both quite \"vague\" regarding how much time they would spend, and concluded that their testimony was \"self-serving, tailored to mislead the court, and completely disingenuous.\" (Mag.'s Decision at 7.) The magistrate reviewed the evidence, and concluded that appellant and Fleming were cohabitating.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   {\u00b6 17} Appellant filed objections to the magistrate's decision on May 1, 2015, objecting to the magistrate's conclusion that she and Fleming were cohabitating and to the magistrate's reliance on\n   <em>\n    State v. McGlothan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4188817\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ohio-st-3d/138/146/\">\n    138 Ohio St.3d 146\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2014-Ohio-85\">\n    2014-Ohio-85\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=4%20N.E.3d%201021\">\n    4 N.E.3d 1021\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Appellant supplemented her objections on July 7, 2015, asserting that the magistrate improperly applied the law from\n   <em>\n    McGlothan\n   </em>\n   and that the magistrate erred by failing to award appellant legal fees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   {\u00b6 18} On December 4, 2015, the trial court issued a decision and entry overruling appellant's objections and adopting the magistrate's decision. The court found no error in the magistrate's conclusion that appellant and Fleming were cohabitating, and specifically found competent, credible evidence demonstrating that appellant and Fleming had lived together, for a sustained duration, and that they shared expenses. The court observed that the magistrate relied on applicable precedent to find cohabitation, and concluded that \"[a]ny application of\n   <em>\n    McGlothan\n   </em>\n   [was] harmless.\" (Decision at 17.) The court found no error in the magistrate's denial of appellant's request for legal fees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    II. ASSIGNMENTS OF ERROR\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   {\u00b6 19} Appellant appeals, assigning the following errors for our review:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   [I.] The trial court's determination that appellant had cohabitated with an unrelated adult male for purposes of terminating spousal support under the parties' divorce decree was not supported by competent, credible evidence.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   a. The trial court's determination that appellant actually lived together with an unrelated adult male was not supported by competent, credible evidence.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   b. The trial court's determination that appellant and an unrelated adult male resided together for a sustained duration was not supported by competent, credible evidence.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   c. The trial court's determination that appellant and an unrelated adult male shared expenses with respect to financing and daily incidental expenses was not supported by competent, credible evidence.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   [II.] The trial court erred and abused its discretion in applying domestic violence precedent regarding cohabitation in the context of a domestic relations spousal support case.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   [III.] The trial court erred and abused its discretion in failing to award any legal fees to appellant.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <strong>\n    III. FIRST ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR-COHABITATION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   {\u00b6 20} Appellant's first assignment of error asserts that the trial court's conclusion that she and Fleming were cohabitating is not supported by competent, credible evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   {\u00b6 21} Civ.R. 53 governs proceedings before a magistrate, including objections to a magistrate's decision. Civ.R. 53(D)(4)(d) provides that \"[i]f one or more objections to a magistrate's decision are timely filed, the court shall rule on those objections.\" In ruling on objections to a\n   magistrate's decision, the trial court must undertake an independent review of the matters objected to in order \"to ascertain [whether] the magistrate has properly determined the factual issues and appropriately applied the law.\" Civ.R. 53(D)(4)(d). The trial court has the \"ultimate authority and responsibility over the [magistrate's] findings and rulings.\"\n   <em>\n    Hartt v.

Fleming stored his corvette in the garage at Marblecliff \"for a few months at the end of 2013.\" (Tr. at 51.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   {\u00b6 31} Fleming does \"some\" general upkeep and repairs at Marblecliff, he has \"fixed some faucets and those type of things.\" (Tr. at 98; Fleming Depo. at 36.) Fleming installed hardwood floors at Marblecliff. Although appellant testified that the floors were \"a gift,\" appellant did not include hardwood floors in the list of gifts she has received from Fleming. (Tr. at 50, 65.) Fleming also installed tile flooring in one of the bathrooms at Marblecliff.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   {\u00b6 32} Furthermore, Case informed Wolfe in June 2013 that \"Mr. Fleming had moved out and moved in with his girlfriend in Upper Arlington.\" (Tr. at 146-47.) The trial court acknowledged Case's testimony recanting his June 2013 statement, but deferred to the magistrate's first-hand observation describing Case's testimony as deliberately evasive, forgetful, and just not credible at all. Appellant argues that it is \"difficult to reconcile how the court can assert that the testimony of [Case] was not credible at one point but conclude that he was at another time when the court was unable to observe his demeanor, temperament, etc.\" (Appellant's brief at 19.) Appellant notes that Case also told Wolfe during their June 2013 conversation that he was a graduate student at OSU, but testified at the hearing that he has never attended OSU.

He received mail there, bought groceries and wine for the household, did household chores, repairs, and made renovations to the home.

Wolfe's observations and his conversation with Case in June 2013, and the filing of the motion to terminate in January 2014, provided the court with competent and credible circumstantial evidence demonstrating that appellant and Fleming lived together from at least June 2013 to January 2014.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   {\u00b6 41} Accordingly, the evidence supported the trial court's conclusion that appellant and Fleming lived together for a sustained duration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   <em>\n    3.

The evidence supports the trial court's conclusion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   {\u00b6 44} For instance, appellant and Fleming attended the Rose Bowl in Pasadena,\n   California in 2010. Although appellant couldn't \"remember exactly who put the air tickets on their credit card,\" she stated that \"when [they] travel, [they] always reimburse, like, if one person pays for the ticket, [one] might pay them back for the ticket or pay back something else to make it relatively equal.\" (Tr. at 27.) However, appellant could not recall who reimbursed who for the Rose Bowl trip, and admitted that she did not have any record of either the payment or reimbursement from that trip. (Tr. at 28.) In 2011, appellant accompanied Fleming to a work conference in Orlando, Florida. Appellant stated that she \"paid for [her] own ticket and [her] own meals\" in Orlando, but then stated that she could not \"remember who paid for dinner, but we usually did make things very even.\" (Tr. at 29.) Appellant and Fleming went to the Florida Keys in 2012 with another couple. Appellant stated that her \"friend Sandy paid for\" the place, and that she and Fleming \"reimbursed her\" then \"divided up the rest between the two of us.\" (Tr. at 30.) Appellant had no record of the payment to her friend or of the reimbursement between herself and Fleming. (Tr. at 31.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   {\u00b6 45} Appellant and Fleming went to Hilton Head, South Carolina in 2012 and Fleming \"picked up most of\" the expenses of that trip. (Tr. at 30.) In 2013, the couple went to Italy for a week. Appellant paid for the rental car in Italy, and converted $1,000 into Euros which she used \"on the trip for [her] and [Fleming's] expenses.\" (Tr. at 34.) Appellant also stated that she \"used [her] credit card a couple times at the end of the trip and so did [Fleming].\" (Tr. at 70.) At her deposition, appellant stated that Fleming paid to take her son on a fishing trip to Canada, but at the hearing, appellant stated that she had paid for her son's portion of the Canada trip. Appellant had no record of this payment, noting \"I'm sure I gave him cash.\" (Tr. at 37.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   {\u00b6 46} Appellant asserts that \"appellee was unable to produce any evidence-circumstantial or otherwise-that appellant and Fleming did not in fact reimburse each other for travel expenses.\" (Appellant's brief at 24-25.) However, the evidence demonstrates that for some of the trips, the couple did not attempt to reimburse each other: Fleming paid for Hilton Head, and appellant provided the spending cash and the car for Italy. Moreover, for the trips where appellant testified that they did reimburse each other, appellant was unable to produce any record of these reimbursements to corroborate her testimony. The trier of fact was under no obligation to believe appellant's testimony that she and Fleming reimbursed each other for travel expenses.\n   <em>\n    Raver\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 21.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   {\u00b6 47} Appellant and Fleming have made significant cash purchases from each other. Fleming bought a new 2012 Honda CRV in July 2012 for $27,833.69, and transferred it to appellant one and one-half years later for a recorded \"sale price of zero dollars.\" (Decision at 15.) Appellant wrote Fleming a $23,475.25 check for the CRV on November 23, 2013. Appellant testified that she paid Fleming \"$25,000 for that car,\" explaining that she \"took out money\" from the purchase price \"that [Fleming] owed [her]\" for a Christmas gift. (Tr. at 53.) Also in 2013, appellant transferred her Ford Focus to Fleming. Fleming did not pay appellant for the vehicle because he was \"test driving it to potentially purchase it.\" (Tr. at 101.) Fleming subsequently sold the car \"to CarMax and [he] gave [appellant] the proceeds.\" (Tr. at 101.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   {\u00b6 48} On December 23, 2013, appellant purchased Fleming's Chatham Lane condo for $90,000. The couple did not use a realtor to process the transaction. Fleming\n   confirmed that the $90,000 from Chatham Lane \"[e]ssentially it went into the Marengo property.\" (Tr. at 108.) The court observed that Fleming's down payment on the Marengo home was \"almost the exact amount of money based on [appellant] buying [Fleming's] Chatham Lane residence and vehicle.\" (Decision at 16.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   {\u00b6 49} Appellant and Fleming also shared day-to-day expenses. Fleming bought groceries and wine for the couple to share at Marblecliff, and appellant and Fleming \"take turns buying meals\" when they go out to eat. (Tr. at 63-64.) Fleming is on appellant's cell phone plan, and appellant stated that Fleming pays her $50 a month \"in cash\" for his portion of the bill. (Tr. at 197.) Fleming has fixed faucets and installed hardwood and tile flooring at Marblecliff. Fleming admitted he was not paid to install the tile floors at Marblecliff, noting that he installed the tile just \"for improvement of the home.\" (Tr. at 98.)\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Laveer v.

SECOND ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR-DOMESTIC VIOLENCE CASE LAW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   {\u00b6 52} Appellant's second assignment of error asserts that the trial court erred by applying domestic violence case law to the cohabitation dispute in the instant case. The trial court, however, found cohabitation established pursuant to the three\n   <em>\n    Moell\n   </em>\n   factors. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Decision at 5-17.) Pursuant to our analysis of appellant's first assignment of error, we have also found cohabitation established pursuant to the\n   <em>\n    Moell\n   </em>\n   factors. Accordingly, cohabitation has been established.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   {\u00b6 53} The magistrate noted both the\n   <em>\n    Moell\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Williams\n   </em>\n   factors for cohabitation, and observed that in\n   <em>\n    Thurston,\n   </em>\n   \"the Tenth District cited the above cases with approval.\" (Magistrate's Decision at 12.) The magistrate further noted that the Supreme Court of Ohio had recently revisited the\n   <em>\n    Williams\n   </em>\n   holding in\n   <em>\n    McGlothan\n   </em>\n   . In\n   <em>\n    McGlothan\n   </em>\n   , the defendant and victim had lived together for one year. Accordingly, because the couple lived together, the \"state had no obligation to demonstrate the sharing of familial or financial responsibilities and consortium to prove cohabitation in [the] case.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 15. Although the magistrate noted\n   <em>\n    McGlothan\n   </em>\n   , the magistrate reviewed the evidence and found cohabitation established based on the \"evidence that these parties actually reside together,\" and the \"direct evidence of financial\n   intermingling and strong circumstantial evidence of shared financial responsibilities.\" (Magistrate's Decision at 12-13.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   {\u00b6 54} The trial court overruled appellant's objections to the magistrate's decision, and expressly held that \"[a]ny application of\n   <em>\n    McGlothan\n   </em>\n   was a harmless error.\" (Decision at 18.) As cohabitation has been established pursuant to the\n   <em>\n    Moell\n   </em>\n   factors in the instant case, any citation in the court below to\n   <em>\n    McGlothan\n   </em>\n   was harmless error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   {\u00b6 55} Based on the foregoing, appellant's second assignment of error is overruled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   <strong>\n    V.
