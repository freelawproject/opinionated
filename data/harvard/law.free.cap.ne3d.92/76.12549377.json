For the following reasons, we reverse that judgment and remand this case to the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   {\u00b6 2} On September 22, 2012, at approximately 2:00 a.m., Koepke attempted to walk across Godown Road at a location approximately 300 to 400 feet north of the intersection with Bethel Road. No crosswalk existed at the point where Koepke tried to traverse Godown Road.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   {\u00b6 3} Before crossing the road, Koepke looked both ways and saw no approaching traffic. As she walked across the southbound lane of Godown Road, Koepke saw a vehicle turn left off of Bethel Road into the northbound lane of Godown Road. Koepke adjudged the vehicle as driving too fast for her to safely cross the northbound lane, so she stopped and stood in the middle of Godown Road. In the location where Koepke stopped, yellow paint forms a wedge-shaped area that precedes the left-hand turn lane for traffic traveling south on Godown Road that intends to turn left, or east, onto Bethel Road (hereinafter we will refer to the wedge-shaped area as \"the median\"). The median is interspersed with\n   wide, yellow diagonal lines and bound on each side by double-yellow lines. Koepke stopped there because, as she later stated, \"[c]ars can't drive in yellow lines.\" (Apr. 28, 2014 Koepke Dep. at 103.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 4} After the vehicle turned onto Godown Road, it swerved to the right, corrected itself, and then swerved in Koepke's direction. Koepke started backing up when she saw the vehicle driving at her, but the vehicle struck Koepke, causing her serious injury. At the time the vehicle hit Koepke, she was still standing in the median. Koepke believes that the front, driver side of the vehicle hit her and the driver-side mirror cut her above her right eyebrow. Because the vehicle left the scene after hitting Koepke, the identity of the driver is unknown.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 5} On September 26, 2013, Koepke filed suit against Metropolitan for breach of contract. In her complaint, Koepke alleged that she was insured under an automobile liability policy issued by Metropolitan that provided her with uninsured motorists coverage. Koepke sought to recover under that policy for the damages caused by the hit-and-run driver.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 6} After conducting discovery, Metropolitan moved for summary judgment. Metropolitan argued that it was entitled to judgment in its favor because Koepke could not prove that the hit-and-run driver was negligent. Under Koepke's insurance policy, Metropolitan agreed to pay for damages caused by an uninsured motorist only if Koepke was legally entitled to collect those damages from the uninsured motorist. Metropolitan reasoned that because the hit-and-run driver was not negligent, Koepke could not recover damages from him, and consequently, her accident was not covered under the policy. In a judgment issued July 28, 2016, the trial court agreed with Metropolitan's argument and granted Metropolitan summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 7} Koepke now appeals the July 28, 2016 judgment, and she assigns the following error:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   THE TRIAL COURT ERRED TO THE PREJUDICE OF PLAINTIFF IN GRANTING DEFENDANT'S MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT, BY RULING AS A MATTER OF LAW THAT NO EVIDENCE EXISTED THAT THE UNKNOWN HIT AND RUN DRIVER WHO STRUCK PLAINTIFF AS A PEDESTRIAN WAS NEGLIGENT, AND THE PLAINTIFF WAS NOT \"REASONABLY DISCERNABLE.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {\u00b6 8} A trial court must grant summary judgment under Civ.R. 56 when the moving party demonstrates that: (1) there is no genuine issue of material fact; (2) the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law; and (3) reasonable minds can come to but one conclusion when viewing the evidence most strongly in favor of the nonmoving party, and that conclusion is adverse to the nonmoving party.\n   <em>\n    Hudson v.

Koepke also contends that she presented evidence that the hit-and-run driver struck her while violating the Ohio traffic code; namely, R.C. 4511.33(A)(1). Given this evidence, Koepke argues that the hit-and-run driver owed her a duty to exercise due care.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   {\u00b6 19} According to R.C. 4511.33 :\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   (A) Whenever any roadway has been divided into two or more clearly marked lanes for traffic, or wherever within municipal corporations traffic is lawfully\n   moving in two or more substantially continuous lines in the same direction, the following rules apply:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   (1) A vehicle or trackless trolley shall be driven, as nearly as is practicable, entirely within a single lane or line of traffic and shall not be moved from such lane or line until the driver has first ascertained that such movement can be made with safety.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Thus, subject to limited exceptions, R.C. 4511.33(A)(1)\"requires a driver to drive a vehicle entirely within a single lane of traffic.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

Generally, crossing the double-yellow lines is a violation of R.C. 4511.33(A)(1).\n   <em>\n    State v. Wooten\n   </em>\n   , 11th Dist. No. 2004-L-084,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2006-Ohio-199\">\n    2006-Ohio-199\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2006%20WL%20156776\">\n    2006 WL 156776\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 20 ;\n   <em>\n    State v.

Double-yellow lines delineate the boundaries of the median. Given Koepke's location at the time of the collision, a question of fact remains regarding whether the hit-and-run driver crossed the double-yellow lines on the eastern boundary of the median. While such a maneuver is legal if a driver first ascertains that he can perform it with safety, the very fact that the hit-and-run driver struck Koepke calls into question whether the hit-and-run driver made the required safety calculation. Moreover, Koepke's testimony regarding the hit-and-run driver's erratic driving immediately prior to the accident creates a question of fact regarding whether the hit-and-run driver planned to leave his lane or, instead, lost control of his vehicle. If the trier of fact concludes that the driver lost control, it may infer that the driver crossed the double-yellow lines without first ascertaining that he could safely leave his lane.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   {\u00b6 21} Due to the existence of questions of fact regarding whether the hit-and-run driver violated R.C. 4511.33(A)(1), we conclude that the trial court erred in granting Metropolitan summary judgment. If a trier of fact concludes that the hit-and-run driver was proceeding unlawfully when he hit Koepke, then the driver may be liable for negligence. Accordingly, we sustain Koepke's assignment of error to the extent that it alleges error in the grant of summary judgment because questions of fact remain regarding the hit-and-run driver's negligence.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   {\u00b6 22} For the foregoing reasons, we sustain the sole assignment of error. We reverse the judgment of the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas, and we remand this case to that court for further proceedings consistent with law and this decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <em>\n    Judgment reversed; cause remanded.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   TYACK, P.J., and BRUNNER, J., concur.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-41\">\n    Koepke's assignment of error also asserts that the trial court erred in finding that she was not reasonably discernable. We express no opinion regarding that issue because resolution of this appeal does not require our review of that issue.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
