WRIGHT, J.\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   {\u00b6 1} Appellant, Thomas Clements, appeals the trial court's decision granting summary judgment in favor of appellees, the Brimfield Township Police Department, Chief David Oliver, Sergeant Matthew McCarty, and Officers Atha, Dumont, and Pettit, based on sovereign immunity. We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   {\u00b6 2} In June of 2010, Cheri Kuss contacted the Brimfield Police Department upon finding her cable box and modem missing from her residence. Officers responded and Kuss informed them that Clements had stolen the items along with her spare house key. She also told the police that Clements did not live there with her. Clements arrived at the residence and told police that he lived there with Kuss and that he had removed the cable box and modem to return them to the cable company. Neither Kuss nor Clements presented a written lease that day demonstrating tenancy. Officer Atha directed Clements to give Kuss the house key and leave the property. Officers also advised Clements he should raise the tenancy issue with the landlord.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   {\u00b6 3} Clements claims that he and Kuss rented the property together as boyfriend and girlfriend and that Kuss lied to the police to get Clements removed. A few\n   days later, the police were again dispatched to the residence in response to an emergency call by Kuss. Clements had stabbed her in the arm during a domestic altercation. Clements was arrested and ultimately pleaded guilty to felonious assault and burglary. After posting bond but before pleading guilty, Sergeant McCarty reported seeing Clements in his vehicle following Kuss in hers. McCarty reported this to Officer Pettit, who included this in a report he was preparing regarding a no-contact order between Kuss and Clements. As a result of this report, Clements claims to have been charged with stalking.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   {\u00b6 4} Clements subsequently filed suit against Kuss, the Brimfield Township Police Department, Chief David Oliver, Sergeant Matthew McCarty, and Officers Atha, Dumont, and Pettit (collectively the Brimfield Police). Although less than clear, he asserted claims against the Brimfield Police for wrongful eviction, conversion, fraudulent misrepresentation, and a civil rights violation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 5} Following discovery, the Brimfield Police moved for summary judgment as to all of Clements' claims based on sovereign immunity, qualified immunity, and Clements' lack of standing to file suit for wrongful eviction. Clements filed two briefs in opposition, and the trial court granted the Brimfield Police summary judgment on all claims in August 2013.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 6} The case proceeded to jury trial against Kuss only in 2016, and the jury ruled in Clements' favor, but did not award him any damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 7} Clements appeals the decision granting the Brimfield Police summary judgment. He does not challenge the decision granting the Brimfield Police judgment on his purported civil rights claim. He asserts six pro se assigned errors:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 8} \"[1] The trial court committed prejudicial error in granting summary judgment to defendants-appellees' Sgt. Matthew McCarty and Officer John Pettit, finding that there is no genuine issue of material fact and that Sgt.

Clements avers that he was unlawfully evicted and that his property was converted as a result of the Brimfield Police directing him to leave the residence that he allegedly shared with Kuss. He also claims the Brimfield Township Police Department and Sergeant McCarty and Officer Pettit wrongfully secured menacing by stalking charges against him, which he asserts is a fraud or fraudulent misrepresentation claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   {\u00b6 19} R.C. 2744.02(A)(1) provides that a political subdivision is generally immune from civil actions, stating:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   {\u00b6 20} \"Except as provided in division (B) of this section, a political subdivision is not liable in damages in a civil action for injury, death, or loss to person or property allegedly caused by any act or omission of the political subdivision or an employee of the political subdivision in connection with a governmental or proprietary function * * *.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   {\u00b6 21} The Brimfield Township Police Department is a political subdivision generally immune from liability in civil actions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   {\u00b6 22} Furthermore, R.C. 2744.03(A)(6) provides that employees of a political subdivision are likewise generally immune for duties associated with his or her job:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   {\u00b6 23} \"[T]he employee is immune from liability\n   <em>\n    unless\n   </em>\n   one of the following applies:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   {\u00b6 24} \"(a) The employee's acts or omissions were manifestly outside the scope of the employee's employment or official responsibilities;\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   {\u00b6 25} \"(b) The employee's acts or omissions were with malicious purpose, in bad faith, or in a wanton or reckless manner;\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   {\u00b6 26} \"(c) Civil liability is expressly imposed upon the employee by a section of the Revised Code.

There is no dispute that the officers named in Clements' suit were acting in the scope of their duties at the time they allegedly committed the torts.

These exceptions to political subdivision employees' immunity have been defined as:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   {\u00b6 28} \"Malicious purpose\" is \"the willful and intentional design to injure or harm another, generally seriously, through unlawful or unjustified conduct.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <em>\n    Jones v.

However, \"we must determine whether, based on the evidence in the record, reasonable minds could conclude that any of the officers acted 'with malicious purpose, in bad faith, or in a wanton or reckless manner' so as to preclude immunity.\"\n   <em>\n    Argabrite,\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 15.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   {\u00b6 30} First, Clements avers that his then girlfriend Kuss had a longstanding relationship with Officer Atha and Chief Oliver and that as a result of her relationships, the Brimfield Police believed her version of the events and acted partially in her favor upon responding to her call reporting a theft. Clements claims that the Brimfield Police told him to leave the premises and believed Kuss over him even though Clements showed the officers several utility statements in his name establishing his right to remain on the property. Clements claims that Kuss and her sister attended school with Officer Atha and that Kuss previously acted as an informant for Chief Oliver, and as such, their actions in believing her were in bad faith, with a malicious purpose, or in a reckless manner. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   {\u00b6 31} Clements' allegations of wrongdoing concern police actions during the course and scope of their official actions in responding to a call reporting a theft. The officers relied on the caller and directed Clements to leave the premises based on Kuss's statement that Clements did not live at the property, that the two had recently broken up, and that she did not want him there. They told Clements that he should address his claimed residency with the property's landlord since it was a civil matter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   {\u00b6 32} Clements alleges that Officer Atha and Chief Oliver had past relationships with Kuss that resulted in a show of favoritism to her in responding to her call. This allegation, however, does not demonstrate either acted with a malicious purpose, in bad faith, or in a wanton or reckless manner so as to preclude immunity. Instead, the officers responded reasonably in light of Kuss's assertion that Clements was not a resident of the property and based on their knowledge of the ongoing domestic issues between Kuss and Clements. Thus, summary judgment was warranted in favor of the Brookfield Police on Clements' claims for wrongful eviction and conversion resulting from his alleged wrongful eviction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   {\u00b6 33} Next Clements appears to assert a fraud or fraudulent misrepresentation claim regarding officers reporting the fact that Clements was following Kuss. As Clements asserts in his first assigned error, the Brimfield Police did not specifically\n   address the factual merits of this claim in its motion for summary judgment. However, the Brimfield Police clearly sought summary judgment on all of Clements' claims on sovereign immunity grounds, and Clements did not raise any exceptions to R.C. 2744.03(A)(6) to preclude immunity on this claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   {\u00b6 34} Furthermore, the Brimfield Police supported their summary judgment motion with Sergeant McCarty's affidavit in which he verifies that he was aware that Clements had posted bond after being indicted for stabbing Kuss. Therefore, upon seeing Clements following Kuss, McCarty reported this to Officer Pettit because he knew that Clements \"had been warned repeatedly to say away from her * * *.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   {\u00b6 35} Its summary judgment motion was also supported by the affidavit of Officer John Pettit, who verifies that McCarty advised him of Clements' proximity to Kuss, and since Pettit had been preparing a police report regarding a no-contact between Clements and Kuss, Pettit included McCarty's observations in his report. Thus, McCarty and Pettit established that they were acting within the course and scope of their official capacities, and as such, are presumed immune from civil liability. Clements does not provide evidence that either was acting with a malicious purpose, in bad faith, or in a wanton or reckless manner.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   {\u00b6 36} Accordingly, summary judgment was proper in favor of the Brimfield Police on Clements' fraud and fraudulent misrepresentation claims, and his first, fifth, and sixth assigned errors lack merit. Consequently, his remaining arguments in his second, third, and fourth assigned errors are moot since our discussion of these issues would be purely advisory.\n   <em>\n    State v.
