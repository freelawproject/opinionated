The parties lived together in Tennessee at the time of the child's birth in August 2010, but Garry moved to North Carolina the following spring when their child was an infant. Julie and the child continued to reside in Tennessee until she relocated to Lake County, Ohio to attend nursing school in 2012.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   {\u00b6 3} Prior to the hearing, the parties agreed that Julie would remain the custodial parent and that Garry would enjoy long distance visitation since he lives in Illinois.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   {\u00b6 4} The issues to be addressed at the hearing included Julie's request for child support retroactive to the child's birth and Garry's request that Julie share equally in the transportation costs associated with his long distance visitation. The magistrate also noted that tax exemption issues and health insurance obligations remained.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 5} Appellant asserts eighteen assigned errors.

The yearly deviation for travel expenses is $735.00.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   {\u00b6 11} Julie contends the trial court erred in imposing 25 percent of Garry's costs associated with visitation because Garry was the parent who initially moved away from the child, and as such, he should bear the costs associated with long distance visitation. Contrary to Julie's argument, however, which parent initially moved away from the child is not determinative.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   {\u00b6 12} Further, Garry remains responsible for 75 percent of his visitation costs, and he testified in detail about the cost of each visit that includes an 11-hour drive each way from Quincy, Illinois to Eastlake, Ohio, and a one-night stay at a hotel when the child is with him on his return trip to Illinois.

We agree that Garry, as the obligor, had to come forward with some evidence that he actually paid for the expense in the year it was claimed and that the expense was necessary and ordinary. He provided none.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   {\u00b6 25} Garry submitted his tax returns to establish his income for the years in issue, i.e. 2011 through 2015. He did not, however, provide any corresponding testimony or evidence as to his alleged necessary and ordinary business expenses that he paid that were listed on his returns as associated with his self-generated income during any years in question.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   {\u00b6 26} While the magistrate expressly agreed that Garry's income should not be reduced by his depreciation expenses, it nevertheless allowed Garry's other business expenses identified on his returns to reduce his income without any evidence that the same were ordinary, necessary, or were actual cash expenditures made in the year claimed. Thus, the trial court erred to the extent that it reduced Garry's income based on any of his business expenses since he failed to satisfy his burden of proof. Accordingly, Julie's second assigned error has merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   {\u00b6 27} Appellant's third assigned error claims:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   {\u00b6 28} \"The trial court erred in its calculations of appellee's child support obligation for 2011 and child support arrearage for the year by misstating his gross income.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   {\u00b6 29} Julie's argument here is twofold. First, she claims the court should have included Garry's $32,930 in income received from the liquidation of his retirement benefit as income. And, assuming we disagree with her first argument, Julie also claims the court's calculation of Garry's 2011 income nevertheless was still understated by $4,000.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   {\u00b6 30} Julie relies on R.C. 3119.01(C)(7) in claiming that Gary's withdrawal should have been included in his 2011 income since \"gross income\" includes \"the total of all earned and unearned income from all sources during a calendar year * * *, and includes income from salaries, wages, overtime pay, and bonuses * * * ; pensions; interest; trust income; annuities * * *.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   {\u00b6 31} Gary testified that he had $32,930 in pension and annuity income in 2011. He withdrew the money to pay off his farm debt.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   {\u00b6 32} R.C. 3119.01(C)(7) also provides in part:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   {\u00b6 33} \" 'Gross income' does not include * * *:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   {\u00b6 34} \"* * *\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   {\u00b6 35} \"(e) Nonrecurring or unsustainable income or cash flow items * * *.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   {\u00b6 36} The magistrate found, and the trial court agreed, that Gary's lump sum $32,930 withdrawal from his annuity and retirement accounts used to pay off a debt was not included as income because it was not recurring. Pursuant to the exception in R.C. 3119.01(C)(7)(e), the trial court did not abuse its discretion in excluding Gary's one-time withdrawal from his retirement accounts that he used to pay off a designated debt since the same is specifically excluded as gross income under the statute. It was neither recurring nor sustainable income. Thus this argument lacks merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   {\u00b6 37} Regardless of this lump sum withdrawal, Julie avers that the trial court still understated Gary's 2011 income by $4,000. We agree. The trial court's child support worksheet states Garry's 2011 gross income as $35,166. However, based on its inclusion of Garry's depreciation expenses as income, his income was $39,166 since $62,069 minus his lump sum $32,930 equals $29,139. And $29,139 plus his depreciation expenses of $1,743 and $8,284 equals $39,166.

As she avers, she testified that she paid an individual $100 per week for as-needed babysitting services in her home while attending college in Tennessee. Julie presented an email from her sitter confirming that she paid her a total of $100 per week from April 2011 to December 2012.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   {\u00b6 44} Garry did not present any evidence to the contrary, but he did object to the admissibility of Julie's email \"receipt\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   from her sitter, which the court sustained. Thus, Garry claims the trial court evidently disregarded Julie's claimed expense as lacking credibility. In light of its decision excluding the email exhibit and its failure to include any childcare expenses on the worksheet, we agree the trial court evidently found her $100 per week babysitting expense was either unreasonable or lacking in credibility. Thus, we see no abuse of discretion, and this assigned error is overruled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   {\u00b6 45} Appellant's fifth alleged error asserts:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   {\u00b6 46} \"The trial court erred in its calculation of appellee's child support arrearage in 2011.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   {\u00b6 47} Julie avers the court erred in determining Garry's support obligation for 2011 and that it should have found he was responsible for nine months of that year, not eight. In response, Garry argues the evidence on this issue was conflicting, and the trial court's resolution of the conflicting evidence was within the court's discretion. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   {\u00b6 48} Julie testified that Garry moved out of their Tennessee home in March of 2011 when their son was an infant. On cross-examination of Julie, Garry's counsel stated that Garry disagreed and believed he moved out of their shared residence in May of 2011, not March. However, Garry never testified on this issue. Julie's testimony was the only evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   {\u00b6 49} Thus, the trial court's child support calculation based only on counsel's statements is not supported by competent, credible evidence, and this assigned error has merit as well. On remand, the trial court should determine Garry's 2011 obligation consistent with Julie's testimony and award her nine months of child support for that year.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   {\u00b6 50} Appellant's sixth alleged error asserts:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   {\u00b6 51} \"The trial court erred in its calculations of appellee's child support obligation in 2012 and child support arrearage for the year.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   {\u00b6 52} Here, Julie claims the trial court miscalculated Garry's income for 2012 by $1,051, and as such, its child support obligation and arrearage determinations for that year were erroneous.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   {\u00b6 53} As Julie contends, Garry's testimony and federal tax returns reflect $49,363 as Garry and his ex-wife's joint income for 2012. Garry testified that his then wife's only income was a $15,000 stipend. Thus, $49,363 minus $15,000 is $34,363. This plus the added depreciation expenses identified in his income tax return for the year of $1,818 and $4,451 equals $40,632. Accordingly, we agree that the court miscalculated his 2012 income at $39,581, and thus, this assigned error has merit since the court's determination is not supported by competent, credible evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   {\u00b6 54} Furthermore, as stated under Julie's second assigned error, the trial court also has to recalculate Garry's income for 2012 based on the lack of evidence establishing any of his business expenses incurred that year.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   {\u00b6 55} Julie's seventh assigned error alleges:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   {\u00b6 56} \"The trial court erred in its calculations of appellee's child support obligation in 2013 and child support arrearage for the year.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   {\u00b6 57} Here, Julie challenges the trial court's failure to include all of her childcare expenses for 2013 in its child support calculations. She avers she spent $7,760 in 2013. However, the trial court's child support worksheet indicates that Julie incurred $7,515 in childcare expenses for\n   2013. Garry did not object to this expense, and there is no calculation or breakdown in the court or magistrate's decision explaining its determination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   {\u00b6 58} Julie submitted a receipt from Little Scholars in support of her testimony indicating their son's weekly rates incurred, activity fees, and payments made from 2013 through 2015. His weekly rates fluctuated from $175 as a toddler to $155 as a preschool-aged child. Although the trial court included an amount close to what Julie paid in 2013, we cannot ascertain the basis for its $7,515 determination to conclude that it is supported by competent, credible evidence. Accordingly, this assigned error has merit since the trial court's $7,515 figure is not supported by competent, credible evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   {\u00b6 59} Appellant's eighth assigned error avers: \"The trial court erred in its calculations of appellee's child support obligation in 2014 and child support arrearage for the year by understating his gross income.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   {\u00b6 60} Julie challenges the trial court's income determination for Garry in 2014.

Garry's 2014 tax returns reflect his federal adjusted gross income as $46,053. However, his adjusted gross income pursuant to his 2014 Missouri return is $58,668. Thus, the court's basis for its income determination is supported by the evidence. Nevertheless, as stated under the second assigned error, the court must recalculate Garry's support obligation for 2014 to the extent it allowed his unverified business expenses for that year to reduce his self-generated income.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   {\u00b6 65} Appellant's ninth alleged error claims:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   {\u00b6 66} \"The trial court erred in its calculations of appellee's child support obligation in 2014 and child support arrearage for the year by failing to consider all of appellant's child care expenses.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   {\u00b6 67} Here, Julie challenges the trial court's figure it used for her 2014 childcare expenses. She testified that she paid for her son to attend Little Scholars and confirmed that the statement she provided, exhibit 15, reflects the rates she paid, including registration and activity fees. Her Little Scholar statement confirms she paid a total of $8,505 in 2014. The court used $7,865 for her 2014 childcare expenses on its worksheet. Because we cannot ascertain the basis for the trial court's calculation based on the evidence, this assigned error has merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   {\u00b6 68} Her tenth assignment of error states:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   {\u00b6 69} \"The trial court erred in its calculations of appellee's child support obligation in 2015 and child support arrearage for the year by misstating his gross income.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   {\u00b6 70} This assigned error again challenges the court's determination of Garry's income based on the difference in Garry's income listed on his 1040 for 2015 and his gross income listed on his Missouri state tax return. Julie claims the court understated his income by $22,565.67 for 2015. While we find no error since the court's decision is supported by some competent, credible evidence, it still must re-determine Garry's income for child support purposes as stated under Julie's second assigned error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   {\u00b6 71} Appellant's eleventh assigned error argues:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   {\u00b6 72} \"The trial court erred in its calculations of appellee's child support obligation in 2015 and child support arrearage for the year by failing to consider all of appellant's child care expenses.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   {\u00b6 73} Here, Julie challenges the court's statement as to her childcare expenses for 2015 as understated by $717.50. Garry contends the court simply disregarded some of Julie's expenses as less than credible.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   {\u00b6 74} She incurred expenses at Little Scholars and Willo-Hill Christian School. The statement submitted from Little Scholars reflects she paid $5,545 in 2015. The statement from Willo-Hill reflects a total of $4,712 in tuition and $330 in fees. However, their son only spent half of the year at Willo-Hill. Thus half of $4,712 is $2,356, plus the $330 in fees, equals $2,686. And $2,686 plus $5,545 is $8,231; whereas the court found that Julie incurred $7,221 total in childcare expenses in 2015.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   {\u00b6 75} Although the court arrived at a figure near the amount Julie was claiming, we do not see how it reached its determination. Thus, this assigned error has merit because its figure is not supported by competent, credible evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   {\u00b6 76} Her twelfth assigned error alleges:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   {\u00b6 77} \"The trial court erred in its calculations of appellee's child support obligation in 2016 and child support arrearage for the year by misstating his gross income.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   {\u00b6 78} Julie argues the court miscalculated Garry's bonus income for 2016, and thus the basis for his support obligation was in error. She claims the court should have averaged his bonuses over a three-year period to determine his 2016 bonus potential.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   {\u00b6 79} The magistrate explained her decision on this issue, stating: \"Father's income\n   for 2015 was $81,176.00, which included a bonus. Pursuant to O.R.C. 3119.05(D), bonus income is to be calculated by the lesser of the actual bonus or an average of bonus payments over three years; however, no evidence was presented as to bonus payments in other years; therefore, the three year average is $8,725.33. With the addition of depreciation, Father's income for 2015 is $67,086.33.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   {\u00b6 80} Julie claims that Garry had to have a bonus in 2014 in light of his testimony that he earned a base salary of $45,000, but that his total 2014 income from employment was $58,668, and as such, the difference had to have been his 2014 bonus. We do not agree since his adjusted gross income was identified as $46,053, which included his business income for that year. Accordingly, this argument lacks merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   {\u00b6 81} Her thirteenth assigned error alleges:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   {\u00b6 82} \"The trial court erred in its calculations of appellee's child support obligation in 2016 and child support arrearage for the year by failing to consider all of appellant's child care expenses.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   {\u00b6 83} She claims the court erred in calculating her childcare expenses for 2016. Julie testified that their son will attend Willo-Hill in 2016 during the school year and the day camp at the local YMCA during the summer. The associated costs are $4,712 for Willo-Hill plus $330 in fees for a total of $5,042. Her cost for the day camp is $126 per week, $25 per week for after care, and $20 per month to be a member of the YMCA. She did not testify to the precise number of weeks that the child would attend. Notwithstanding, assuming he only spent two total months or eight weeks at the YMCA, then Julie's costs were $1,648. Together, the two cost $6,690.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   {\u00b6 84} Again, Garry did not challenge her claimed expenses for these providers, but the trial court included only $3,661 as her childcare expenses for 2016 without explanation. This figure does not comport with the evidence, and as such, Julie's thirteenth assigned error has merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   {\u00b6 85} Appellant's fourteenth assignment of error asserts:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   {\u00b6 86} \"The trial court erred in failing to order appellee to provide comprehensive health care insurance coverage for the minor child.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   {\u00b6 87} R.C. 3109.05(A)(2) states: \"The court, in accordance with Chapter 3119. of the Revised Code, shall include in each support order made under this section the requirement that one or both of the parents provide for the health care needs of the child to the satisfaction of the court * * *.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   {\u00b6 88} \"[T]he order shall include one of the following:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   {\u00b6 89} \"(1) A requirement that both the obligor and the obligee obtain private health insurance coverage for the children if coverage is available * * *.\" R.C. 3119.30(B)(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   {\u00b6 90} R.C. 3119.30(A) states in part,\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   {\u00b6 91} \"In any action or proceeding in which a child support order is issued or modified, the court * * * shall determine the person or persons responsible for the health care of the children subject to the child support order and shall include provisions for the health care of the children in the child support order.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   {\u00b6 92} Julie avers the court erred in failing to order Garry to provide continuing health care insurance coverage for their son in spite of the fact that it considered his associated costs in the child support worksheet. However, the trial court\n   does require Garry to provide the child's health insurance, albeit in less than clear terms. Its decision states:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   {\u00b6 93} \"It is therefore ordered:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   {\u00b6 94} \"* * *\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   {\u00b6 95} \"Garry R.

Thus, this assigned error lacks merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   {\u00b6 98} Appellant's fifteenth assignment of error asserts:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   {\u00b6 99} \"The trial court erred in failing to allocate between the parties the responsibility for payment of the uninsured and unreimbursed health care expense of the minor child.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   {\u00b6 100} As Julie avers, R.C. 3119.32\n   <em>\n    Contents of support order\n   </em>\n   requires a court to determine which parent or both are responsible for the child's out-of-pocket medical expenses.
