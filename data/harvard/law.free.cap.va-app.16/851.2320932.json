On appeal, defendant complains that he was unlawfully arrested and that the trial court erred in admitting certain impeachment evidence, his statement to police and a \u2018 \u2018tainted\u2019 \u2019 identification. For the reason stated below, we reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-11\">Upon appeal from a trial court\u2019s ruling on a motion to suppress, we must view the evidence in the light most favorable to the prevailing party, granting to it all reasonable inferences fairly deducible therefrom. <em>Commonwealth v. Grimstead, </em>12 Va. App. 1066, 1067, 407 S.E.2d 47, 48 (1991); <em>Reynolds v. Commonwealth, 9 </em>Va. App. 430, 436, 388 S.E.2d 659, 663 (1990). The findings of the trial court will not be disturbed unless \u201cplainly wrong,\u201d <em>Grimstead, </em>12 Va. App. at 1067, 407 S.E.2d at 48, and the burden is upon the appellant to show reversible error. <em>Reynolds, 9 </em>Va. App. at 436, 388 S.E.2d at 663.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-12\">The evidence disclosed that, on February 20, 1990, Sandra Harris (Harris) was awakened in her home between 4:00 and 5:00 a.m. by \u201csomebody touching [her] chest . . . inside [her] shirt.\u201d When she <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"854\">*854</page-number>realized that a \u201cguy ... with a porcelain face mask on\u201d was \u201cleaning on top of [her],\u201d holding \u201ca knife to [her] throat,\u201d Harris \u201cstarted fighting him\u201d and \u201che cut [her]\u201d hand. She then promised not to \u201cscream,\u201d and the intruder \u201cput the mask on top of his head,\u201d allowing Harris to \u201clook directly into his face . . . about a minute.\u201d In an effort to escape, Harris \u201cran to the front door,\u201d and the assailant \u201cjumped out of the window and took off.\u201d .</p>\n<p id=\"b896-5\">Shortly thereafter, Officer Thomas Scotting (Scotting) \u201creceived a call to assist another unit\u201d in response to a \u201cstabbing\u201d at a nearby \u201clocation.\u201d A description of the \u201csuspect\u201d was transmitted to Scotting and, \u201cwhile checking the area,\u201d he observed defendant \u201ccome from around the back side ... of [a] motel.\u201d Scotting viewed this conduct as \u201csuspicious\u201d because there were \u201cno rooms back there\u201d or \u201canything leading to that area of the motel.\u201d He also noted that defendant \u201cmatched\u201d the description of the suspect and was alone on the street. Scotting entered the motel office, followed by defendant, who requested a cab and \u201cwalked out.\u201d When Scotting turned to follow, defendant had \u201cdisappeared.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b896-6\">Scotting continued to patrol the area and saw defendant \u201ccoming out of the shadows\u201d as a taxi approached. Defendant walked in the direction of the patrol car and Scotting \u201casked him to come over ... a foot or two\u201d to his \u201cunit.\u201d He advised defendant that police were searching for a person of his description, \u201cfrisked\u201d him for weapons and inquired \u201cif he would voluntarily go to a showup at a particular location.\u201d Defendant agreed, after Scotting assured him that the police would return him \u201cto catch his cab,\u201d provided \u201cnothing transpired.\u201d Although Scotting testified that defendant was not under arrest, he was handcuffed and transported in the rear seat of the vehicle \u201cabout a quarter of a block\u201d to Harris\u2019 residence.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-7\">On arrival, Harris \u201cwalkfed] out to the police car,\u201d \u201clooked at [defendant\u2019s] face,\u201d and \u201ctold [police] that it was him.\u201d However, she \u201cwanted to make sure [she] wasn\u2019t falsely accusing somebody\u201d and \u201casked to see him standing up,\u201d to \u201clook at his body size.\u201d Defendant, still handcuffed, was then \u201cwalked . . . up . . . [the] sidewalk\u201d by a police officer, and Harris confirmed that she was \u201cabsolutely sure,\u201d \u201cpositive that it was him.\u201d She again identified the defendant at the preliminary hearing, the suppression hearing and trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-8\">Following Harris\u2019 initial identification, defendant was arrested and taken into custody and, after being \u201cadvised of his legal rights,\u201d was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"855\">*855</page-number>interviewed by Officers Dunn (Dunn) and Dickerson (Dickerson). During this questioning, defendant admitted that he had entered Harris\u2019 home, taken \u201ca knife out of her drawer\u201d and \u201cthought about . . . raping her but. . . didn\u2019t.\u201d Dickerson recalled that the interview ended at 2:30 p.m., when defendant indicated that he wished to speak with an attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-5\">Defendant was continuously in custody from his arrest on February 20, 1990, until trial on October 31, 1990. A preliminary hearing on the charges was conducted on March 14, 1990, and defendant was indicted on April 4, 1990. Trial was originally scheduled for May 21, 1990, but continued, on defendant\u2019s motion, until August 22, 1990.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-6\">Defendant testified at trial and denied involvement in the offenses. When the Commonwealth attempted to impeach him with evidence of two prior felony convictions, defense counsel objected, arguing that these convictions were not \u201cfinal\u201d because defendant \u201cha[dj not yet been sentenced.\u201d The trial court overruled the objection and this evidence was presented to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-7\">I. IMPEACHMENT</p>\n<p id=\"b897-8\">Defendant first contends that he was improperly impeached \u201cthrough the use of . . . guilty verdicts prior to sentencing.\u201d This Court concluded in <em>Dowell v. Commonwealth, </em>12 Va. App. 1145, 1149, 408 S.E.2d 263, 265 (1991), <em>aff\u2019d en banc, </em>14 Va. App. 58, 414 S.E.2d 440 (1992), that a finding of guilty, following a plea of not guilty, does not constitute a conviction for impeachment purposes until memorialized by final order of the trial court. We also found that the admission of such evidence was not harmless because a defendant\u2019s credibility becomes \u201ccrucial\u201d once he elects to testify. <em>Id. </em>at 1149, 408 S.E.2d at 265-66. \u201cIf the jury had believed his testimony, there could have been no conviction.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Defendant was, therefore, improperly impeached with evidence of still pending prosecutions, and we must reverse and remand for a new trial.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b897-9\">II. THE SEIZURE</p>\n<p id=\"b897-10\">\u2018 \u2018A \u2018seizure\u2019 for purposes of the fourth amendment occurs when the \u2018circumstances .. . amount to a show of official authority such that a reasonable person would have believed that he was not free to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"856\">*856</page-number>leave.\u2019 \u201d <em>Moss </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>7 Va. App. 305, 307, 373 S.E.2d 170, 171-72 (1988) (quoting <em>Florida </em>v. <em>Royer, </em>460 U.S. 491, 502 (1983)). Under this test, Scotting\u2019s detention of defendant clearly constituted a seizure. However, \u201c[t]he Fourth Amendment does not proscribe all seizures, only those that are \u2018unreasonable.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 476, 419 S.E.2d at 250 (citing <em>Terry </em>v. <em>Ohio, </em>392 U.S. 1, 9 (1968)). To justify the seizure in this instance, Scotting must have possessed \u201ca reasonable and articulable suspicion of criminal activity on the part of the defendant,\u201d <em>Commonwealth v. Holloway, 9 </em>Va. App. 11, 15, 384 S.E.2d 99, 101 (1989), based upon \u201cthe totality of the circumstances.\u201d <em>Wells v. Commonwealth, </em>6 Va. App. 541, 551, 371 S.E.2d 19, 24 (1988) (quoting <em>United States v. Cortez, </em>449 U.S. 411, 417-18 (1981)).</p>\n<p id=\"b898-5\">When Scotting observed defendant, he was aware that a serious and violent crime had just occurred in the immediate vicinity. Defendant matched the description of the suspect, was alone on the street less than one block from the crime scene, and was behaving suspiciously. Such circumstances clearly presented sufficient articulable facts to justify Scotting\u2019s initial investigatory detention under <em>Terry. See Smith v. Commonwealth, </em>12 Va. App. 1100, 1103, 407 S.E.2d 49, 51-52 (1991); <em>Wells, 6 </em>Va. App. at 552, 371 S.E.2d at 25.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-6\">However, even if this initial encounter was permissible, defendant contends that the ensuing detention, during which he was handcuffed, placed in a patrol car and transported to the victim\u2019s home, enlarged the scope of investigative activity into an arrest without probable cause. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-7\">Although we recognize that \u201c \u2018police procedures [during a <em>Terry </em>stop] can ... be so intrusive ... as to trigger the full protection of the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments,\u2019 \u201d <em>DePriest v. Commonwealth, 4 </em>Va. App. 577, 586, 359 S.E.2d 540, 544 (1987) (quoting <em>Hayes </em>v. <em>Florida, </em>470 U.S. 811, 815-16 (1985)), <em>cert. denied, </em>488 U.S. 985 (1988), there is no \u201c \u2018litmus-paper test for distinguishing . . . when a seizure exceeds the bounds of an investigative stop.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Royer, </em>460 U.S. at 506). The Supreme Court has instructed that, in \u201c \u2018evaluating whether an investigative detention is unreasonable, common sense and ordinary human experience must govern over rigid criteria.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>United States v. Sharpe, </em>470 U.S. 675, 685 (1985)). While the \u201cinvestigative methods employed should be the least intrusive means reasonably available to verify or dispel the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"857\">*857</page-number>officer\u2019s suspicion in a short period of time,\u201d the \u2018\u2018scope of the intrusion permitted will vary [with each case].\u201d <em>Royer, </em>460 U.S. at 500.</p>\n<p id=\"b899-5\">In this instance, the transportation of defendant less than one block for an immediate showup did not transform the initial detention into an arrest. Transportation of a suspect a short distance for possible identification has consistently been found reasonable and consonant with Fourth Amendment safeguards. <em>See State v. Mitchell, </em>527 A.2d 1168, 1172-74 (Conn.), <em>cert. denied, </em>484 U.S. 927 (1987); <em>Buckingham v. State, </em>482 A.2d 327, 334 (Del. 1984); <em>Wilkerson v. United States, 427 </em>A.2d 923, 925-26 (D.C.), <em>cert. denied, </em>454 U.S. 852 (1981); <em>People v. Lippert, </em>432 N.E.2d 605, 609-12 (Ill.), <em>cert. denied, </em>459 U.S. 841 (1982); <em>People </em>v. <em>Kincy, </em>435 N.E.2d 831, 835-36 (Ill. App. Ct. 1982); <em>People v. Hicks, </em>500 N.E.2d 861, 865-66 (N.Y. 1986); <em>State v. Wheeler, </em>737 P.2d 1005, 1007-08 (Wash. 1987). Moreover, the trial judge made a specific finding that defendant \u2018\u2018said he would not mind\u201d accompanying Scotting to the victim\u2019s residence.</p>\n<p id=\"b899-6\">The use of handcuffs during this phase of the investigation does not alter our analysis. Brief, complete deprivations of a suspect\u2019s liberty, including handcuffing, \u2018\u2018do not convert a stop and frisk into an arrest so long as the methods of restraint used are reasonable to the circumstances.\u201d <em>United States v. Crittendon, </em>883 F.2d 326, 329 (4th Cir. 1989); <em>see also United States v. Moore, </em>817 F.2d 1105, 1108 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>484 U.S. 965 (1987); <em>United States v. Kapperman, 764 </em>F.2d 786, 790 n.4 (11th Cir. 1985); <em>United States v. Bautista, </em>684 F.2d 1286, 1289 (9th Cir. 1982), <em>cert. denied, </em>459 U.S. 1211 (1983). Here, it was \u2018\u2018dark,\u201d and Scotting, alone, was briefly detaining and transporting an individual suspected of involvement in a serious, violent and recent crime. Under such circumstances, Scotting\u2019s caution was justified and prudent, and his use of handcuffs was not unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b899-7\">Moreover, the record discloses that defendant was advised of the specific, limited purpose of the detention and assented to the identification procedure proposed by Scotting. When he agreed to cooperate, defendant also implicitly consented to those limited intrusions upon his personal liberties reasonably related to the transportation and showup. Handcuffs, like the unavoidable restraint of travel in the moving vehicle, were only incidents of the investigatory activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b899-8\">The record thus discloses that police \u201c \u2018diligently pursued a means of investigation that was likely to confirm or dispel their suspicions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"858\">*858</page-number>quickly, during which time it was necessary to detain the defendant.\u2019 \u201d <em>DePriest, 4 </em>Va. App. at 587, 359 S.E.2d at 545 (quoting <em>Sharpe, </em>470 U.S. at 686); <em>see also Limonja v. Commonwealth, </em>8 Va. App. 532, 542, 383 S.E.2d 476, 482 (1989), <em>cert. denied, </em>495 U.S. 905 (1990). Such detention was neither unreasonable nor conducted under circumstances that constituted the functional equivalent of an arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b900-5\">HI. THE CONFESSION</p>\n<p id=\"b900-6\">Review on appeal of the voluntariness of a statement requires an \u201cindependent examination\u201d of \u201c \u2018the totality of all the surrounding circumstances\u2019 \u201d to ascertain if it was \u201cthe \u2018product of an essentially free and unconstrained choice by its maker,\u2019 or whether the maker\u2019s will \u2018has been overborne and his capacity for self-determination critically impaired.\u2019 \u201d <em>Wilson v. Commonwealth, </em>13 Va. App. 549, 551, 413 S.E.2d 655, 656 (1992); <em>Gray v. Commonwealth, </em>233 Va. 313, 324, 356 S.E.2d 157, 163 (quoting <em>Schneckloth </em>v. <em>Bustamonte, </em>412 U.S. 218, 225-26 (1973)), <em>cert. denied, </em>484 U.S. 873 (1987). Nevertheless, \u201csubsidiary\u201d factual findings by the trial court are \u201centitled to a presumption of correctness.\u201d <em>Gray, </em>233 Va. at 324, 356 S.E.2d at 163.</p>\n<p id=\"b900-7\">In the instant case, Dunn testified that he \u201cread each and every question along with\u201d defendant and that defendant appeared to \u201cunderstand the rights.\u201d Dickerson noted that defendant \u201cseemed very willing, if not relieved, to talk ... about the events that had occurred,\u201d \u201cwas very cooperative\u201d and wanted \u201cto tell everything.\u201d Although defendant claims that his statement \u201cwasn\u2019t voluntary\u201d because he invoked his right to counsel immediately after executing the form and was told that \u201ca black man cannot win a rape case against three white women in Virginia,\u201d the trial court found his testimony \u201coutrageous\u201d and \u201cnot credible,\u201d concluding that the \u201cstatement was at every point carefully taken\u201d from defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b900-8\">Our independent review of the totality of the circumstances confirms that defendant\u2019s statement was given freely and voluntarily. The evidence discloses that he was \u201cfully cognizant of his situation, was in control of his cognitive powers, understood the circumstances, and was exercising his free will when he admitted his involvement in the crime.\u201d <em>Wilson, </em>13 Va. App. at 554, 413 S.E.2d at 658. The trial court, therefore, properly denied the motion to suppress the statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"859\">*859</page-number>IV. THE IDENTIFICATION</p>\n<p id=\"b901-5\">To determine \u201cwhether a particular identification is reliable\u201d and to evaluate \u201c \u2018the likelihood of misidentification,\u2019 \u201d we must consider</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b901-6\">the opportunity of the witness to view the criminal at the time of the crime, the witness\u2019 degree of attention, the accuracy of the witness\u2019 prior description of the criminal, the level of certainty demonstrated by the witness at the confrontation, and the length of time between the crime and the confrontation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b901-7\"><em>Townes </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>234 Va. 307, 331, 362 S.E.2d 650, 663 (1987) (quoting <em>Neil v. Biggers, </em>409 U.S. 188, 199-200 (1972)), <em>cert. denied, </em>485 U.S. 971 (1988); <em>Delong v. Commonwealth, </em>234 Va. 357, 367, 362 S.E.2d 669, 674 (1987), <em>cert. denied, </em>485 U.S. 929 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b901-8\">Harris testified that she looked \u201cdirectly\u201d at defendant\u2019s face for \u201cabout a minute\u201d during the attack, her initial description of the assailant was accurate, and she manifested a high level of certainty throughout all subsequent confrontations with defendant. At both the showup and preliminary hearing, Harris testified that she was \u201cdefinite it was him,\u201d and she was \u201cpositive\u201d in her identification at trial. Finally, only ten minutes separated the crime from the showup, and less than one month passed between the offense and the preliminary hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-9\">Defendant\u2019s contention that the objectivity of the showup was compromised because he was then handcuffed is without merit. In <em>Delong, </em>the Supreme Court approved the trial court\u2019s refusal to suppress eyewitness identification when the defendant was handcuffed, finding the identification \u201cuncontestably reliable.\u201d 234 Va. at 366-67, 362 S.E.2d at 674-75. The reliability of Harris\u2019 identification is similarly compelling in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-10\">We are also not persuaded by defendant\u2019s argument that the preliminary hearing identification was unduly suggestive because he was \u201cthe only person in the room dressed in jail garb.\u201d In <em>Townes, </em>the accused claimed that a preliminary hearing identification under similar circumstances had tainted a subsequent in-court identification. 234 Va. at 331, 362 S.E.2d at 663-64. However, the Court found the earlier incident \u201cinsufficient\u201d to discredit the subsequent identification. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b902-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"860\">*860</page-number>Finally, Harris\u2019 knowledge that defendant had confessed prior to the preliminary hearing also did not taint the identification process. She had previously unequivocally identified defendant and attributed that testimony to \u201cwhat [she] recalled\u201d from \u201cthe night [of] the incident.\u201d <em>McCary v. Commonwealth, </em>228 Va. 219, 232-34, 321 S.E.2d 637, 644-45 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b902-5\">Viewing the totality of these circumstances, we conclude that the reliability of Harris\u2019 identification was well established, without any substantial likelihood of misidentification, and that the trial court properly refused to suppress this evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-6\">V. SPEEDY TRIAL</p>\n<p id=\"b902-7\">Code \u00a7 19.2-243 requires that the trial of an incarcerated accused commence within \u201cfive months after a general district court finds probable cause to believe that the defendant has committed a crime.\u201d <em>Shearer v. Commonwealth, 9 </em>Va. App. 394, 399, 388 S.E.2d 828, 830 (1990). Absent satisfactory explanation by the Commonwealth for delay extending beyond the statutory period, the prosecution will be dismissed. <em>Id. </em>However, delay which is attributable to the defendant \u201cwill not be counted in determining whether the Commonwealth complied\u201d with the statutory mandate. <em>Id.; </em>Code \u00a7 19.2-243(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b902-8\">In the instant case, 231 days elapsed between defendant\u2019s preliminary hearing on March 14, 1990 and his trial on October 31, 1990. Of these, 93 days resulted from an order, entered on defendant\u2019s motion, which continued the original trial date from May 21, 1990 to August 22, 1990. When this period of time is properly excluded from computation, defendant\u2019s trial was commenced within 138 days of the hearing, in compliance with statute. Code \u00a7 19.2-243.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-9\">Defendant insists, however, that this continuance order related only to charges involving an unrelated offense and victim, Sherry Dickinson (Dickinson).</p>\n<p id=\"b902-10\">In \u201cassessing responsibility for delay in trying a defendant,\u201d we must \u201cconfine our review to the record.\u201d <em>Godfrey v. Commonwealth, </em>227 Va. 460, 464, 317 S.E.2d 781, 783 (1984). \u201cRepresentations of counsel, or even of the trial judge, if not supported by the record, are insufficient. Memories are too fragile to supply authoritatively what the record fails to reveal.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Thus, continuances \u2018 \u2018must be documented to enable us to review and evaluate them <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"861\">*861</page-number>when they are challenged.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Furthermore, \u201c[wjhere a defendant does not object to the accuracy of an order within 21 days after its entry, an appellate court may \u2018presume that the order, as the final pronouncement on the subject, rather than a transcript that may be flawed by omissions, accurately reflects what transpired.\u2019 \u201d <em>Kern </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>2 Va. App. 84, 88, 341 S.E.2d 397, 400 (1986) (quoting <em>Stamper </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>220 Va. 260, 280-81, 257 S.E.2d 808, 822 (1979), <em>cert. denied, </em>445 U.S. 972 (1980)).</p>\n<p id=\"b903-4\">The continuance order in issue referenced charges then pending on both the Harris and Dickinson indictments, without limitation to either case. On the date of its entry, these offenses had not been severed for trial, shared the same docket number and were lodged in a common file. Moreover, assuming, as defendant argues, that only the Dickinson indictments were scheduled for trial on May 21, the record discloses that, \u201cby agreement between the Commonwealth and the defense,\u201d continuance of the Dickinson charges necessitated a continuance of the Harris cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b903-5\">The Commonwealth, therefore, adequately explained the delay between May 21, 1990 and August 22, 1990 as attributable to defendant and the trial court properly denied the motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b903-6\">Accordingly, defendant\u2019s convictions are reversed for the foregoing reason and the case is remanded for a new trial, if the Commonwealth be so advised.</p>\n<p id=\"b903-7\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b903-8\">Koontz, J.,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b897-11\"> Although we reverse and remand on this issue, we will address the remaining questions as they may reoccur at retrial.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b903-13\"> When the case was argued, Judge Koontz presided.

The majority opinion recognizes that Thomas was seized. The evidence in this case proved, however, that, without probable cause, the police detained Thomas to a degree that was the functional equivalent of an arrest.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b904-5\"><em>Terry </em>and its progeny . . . created only limited exceptions to the general rule that seizures of the person require probable cause to arrest. Detentions may be \u201cinvestigative\u201d yet violative of the Fourth Amendment absent probable cause. In the name of investigating a person who is no more than suspected of criminal activity, the police may not carry out a full search of the person or of his automobile or other effects. Nor may the police seek to verify their suspicions by means that approach the conditions of arrest.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b904-6\"><em>Florida </em>v. Royer, 460 U.S. 491, 499 (1983) (citations omitted). In determining whether an arrest has occurred, \u201c[t]he only relevant inquiry is how a reasonable person in the suspect\u2019s position would have understood his situation.\u201d <em>Berkemer </em>v. <em>McCarty, </em>468 U.S. 420, 442 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b904-7\">The evidence proved that following the assault on the victim in her apartment, Officer Scotting began checking the area in the vicinity of the apartment. He testified that while he was checking the area, he received a description of the suspect as a \u201cblack male, five foot seven to five foot nine with slight mustache.\u201d As Scotting approached a motel to make an inquiry of the clerk, he saw Thomas come from an area behind the motel and walk toward the motel\u2019s office. Scotting did not stop Thomas or ask him any questions. Scotting said he went into the motel office and asked whether the clerk had seen a man \u201crunning toward the back of the motel.\u201d Thomas, who lived nearby, entered the motel office and asked the clerk to call a taxi cab to take him to work. Scotting testified that he observed that Thomas wore a white pullover shirt with an orange stripe across the chest. He also noted that Thomas wore black stone washed jeans and black hightop tennis shoes. Although Scotting testified at trial that he thought it suspicious that Thomas was there, he also testified that he did not approach Thomas or examine Thomas\u2019 face to check whether he had a slight mustache. Indeed, when Scotting arrived at the motel he saw no reason to stop Thomas, even though he was searching for a suspect. Thomas was not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"863\">*863</page-number>suspicious to him. Although Scotting testified that he did not stop Thomas, he testified that when he left the motel after Thomas made his request, Thomas was gone.</p>\n<p id=\"b905-5\">The motel clerk testified that between 4 and 5 a.m. she saw ten or twelve police cars down the block from the motel. She testified that a policeman later came into her office and asked if she had seen a \u201ctall black male wearing a Christmas tree-looking shirt.\u201d Scotting testified, however, that he did not have a description of the suspect\u2019s clothing when he went to the motel. The notes he used at trial also indicate that he had no clothing description when he went to the motel. He denied telling the clerk that he was looking for a tall black male, and he could not recall asking about clothing or a \u201cChristmas tree shirt.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The clerk testified that Thomas was in the motel talking to her about calling a taxi cab at the same time the officer arrived. The clerk said that before she could respond to the officer, his radio came on and he left. She said the officer saw Thomas in the motel but did not question him.</p>\n<p id=\"b905-6\">The clerk further testified that after she called the taxi cab, Thomas left the lobby and waited outside the motel. She saw him standing near <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"864\">*864</page-number>the motel until his taxi cab arrived. She also testified that when the taxi cab arrived, \u201ca police car pulled in front of the cab and one behind the cab and a policeman walked over to [Thomas] and grabbed his arm and they walked him over to the police car.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b906-5\">Scotting testified that after he left the motel he received no additional description of the suspect. He further testified that as he searched the area he saw Thomas by an apartment building adjacent to the motel and near a telephone. Scotting said he drove over to Thomas and stationed himself in Thomas\u2019s path as the taxi cab arrived and that Thomas walked toward his police vehicle. Scotting said that at that time he felt Thomas was a suspect because of his suspicious presence and his physical characteristics. Scotting testified that he stopped Thomas, advised him that they were \u201clooking for someone in the area,\u201d made him put his hands on the police car, and searched him. He said Thomas protested but then agreed to go to a showup.</p>\n<p id=\"b906-6\">Scotting\u2019s notes related only that Scotting \u201capproached the suspect and took him into custody.\u201d His notes do not state that Scotting asked Thomas to go to the victim\u2019s house or that Thomas volunteered to go. The notes state, \u201cI proceeded to him and placed him in the back seat of my unit and transported [him].\u201d Scotting testified that after he told Thomas he was looking for a black male fitting Thomas\u2019s description and asked Thomas to put his hands on the car for a search, Thomas protested. His notes state that \u201cat the time of the apprehension Mr. Thomas stated to me \u2018Are you guys grabbing the first black guy you see?\u2019 \u201d Scotting could not recall putting handcuffs on Thomas. He testified, however, that Thomas was in custody and was under apprehension. He explained: \u201cWhen I put handcuffs on someone, put them in the back seat of the car, tell them they are under arrest that\u2019s an apprehension.\u201d He believed that he had probable cause to arrest Thomas because of Thomas\u2019s physical description. However, when he stopped Thomas he had received no clothing description that he could recall.</p>\n<p id=\"b906-7\">Thomas testified that he lived near the motel and was trying to get a taxi cab to get to work. He testified that he entered the motel office at the same time Scotting did, and he asked the clerk to call a taxi cab. While he was waiting near the motel for the taxi cab, another officer approached him and asked him whether he had seen a man with a Christmas tree shirt. Indeed, the notes Scotting took immediately after the incident state that another officer had stopped a man and released him.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"865\">*865</page-number>Thomas said that when the taxi cab arrived, Scotting stopped him, asked for his identification, and told him to put his hands on the car. He said Scotting then searched him, put handcuffs on him, and put him in Scotting\u2019s automobile.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Thomas said that Scotting then told him that he was taking him somewhere for an identification.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-5\">The evidence does not support a finding that this was an investigative detention. \u201cThe mere fact that [Thomas] was not told he was under arrest, was not \u2018booked,\u2019 and would not have [been arrested] if the [showup] had proved fruitless, while not insignificant for all purposes, obviously do not make [Thomas\u2019s] seizure even roughly analogous to the narrowly defined intrusions involved in <em>Terry </em>and its progeny.\u201d <em>Dunaway </em>v. <em>New York, </em>442 U.S. 200, 212-13 (1979); <em>see also London v. State, </em>540 So. 2d 211, 213 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b907-6\">The officer did not make any inquiries of Thomas. Scotting\u2019s notes state that he \u201cparked [his] police unit and approached the suspect taking him into custody.\u201d Scotting testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b907-7\">I asked him to come over by my police unit, which is within a foot or two of where we were, and advised him we were looking for a black male fitting his general description. I didn\u2019t advise him of anything else. I asked him to put his hands on the car for a weapon search.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b907-8\">Thomas protested, stating, \u201cWhat are you just grabbing the first black guy you see?\u201d Scotting searched him, put handcuffs on him, and put him in the back seat of the car. The notes contain no reference to a discussion or to a request that Thomas go to a place to be identified as a participant in a crime. The notes merely state, \u201cI then transported Mr. Thomas to the crime scene.\u201d In response to the question, \u201cHe was in custody and was under apprehension?\u201d Scotting said, \u201cYes.\u201d He further stated that \u201c[a]n apprehension is when I have actually put my hands on you and advised you that you are under arrest.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b907-9\">Thomas testified that the officer did not speak to him, except to ask for identification and then ordered him to place his hands on the car. He said Scotting then searched him and handcuffed him. Scotting\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"866\">*866</page-number>notes do not indicate that Scotting spoke to Thomas before searching him and putting handcuffs on him. Officer Scotting and Thomas agree that Thomas protested, saying, \u201cWhat are you guys doing grabbing the first black guy that you see.\u201d Thomas also testified that after he was handcuffed and put in the car, Scotting said, \u201cI just want you to go somewhere with me.\u201d Thomas testified that he was not asked to consent to the procedure and did not consent.</p>\n<p id=\"b908-5\">Conduct can constitutecan arrest. It is not necessary for the police to use the word \u201carrest.\u201d In one case, an officer was found to have arrested the suspect when he \u201cpushed [a suspect] against the wall and told him not to move.\u201d <em>United States v. Moreno, </em>897 F.2d 26, 31 (2d Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>497 U.S 1009 (1990). Thomas was not questioned briefly when he was stopped so as to suggest an investigation. He was told to put his hands on the car, he was searched, he was handcuffed, and he was not informed that he could leave. This was the functional equivalent of an arrest. <em>See United States v. Hatfield, </em>815 F.2d 1068, 1071 (6th Cir. 1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b908-6\">The officer\u2019s conduct also had the effect of making any later consent involuntary. When Scotting stopped Thomas, he told Thomas that Thomas was suspected of committing an unspecified crime. Thomas was told to put his hands on the car and he was searched. Even though Thomas verbally protested, he was handcuffed. Thomas testified that he was put in die back of Scotting\u2019s car and told that he was being taken to another location for an identification. Although Thomas denied giving consent to being transported, Scotting said that Thoi. consented to be transported. Even if Thomas consented to be transported, he did so after protest and while handcuffed. Moreover, Scotting never told Thomas that he was free to leave. Thus, at the time Scotting said Thomas consented, Thomas was subjected to \u201ca more serious intrusion on his personal liberty than is allowable on mere suspicion of criminal activity.\u201d Royer, 460 U.S. at 502.</p>\n<p id=\"b908-7\">The evidence does not prove a free and voluntary consent. \u201c[T]he State has the burden of proving that the necessary consent was obtained and that it was freely and voluntarily given, a burden that is not satisfied by showing a mere submission to a claim of lawful authority.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 497. When the uniformed officer told Thomas he was suspected of criminal activity, he made no inquiry concerning Thomas\u2019s purpose for being on the street, asked no other questions to dispel his suspicions, searched Thomas, handcuffed Thomas, and asked Thomas to go with him to another location without telling Thomas that he was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"867\">*867</page-number>free to leave, any consent obtained was not freely and voluntarily given. If Thomas consented, that consent was given only after he had protested the intrusion upon his liberty, after he was handcuffed, and after he was put within the confines of the police vehicle. Although Thomas may have agreed to be transported after being handcuffed and placed in the police car, \u201cthe detention to which he was then subjected was a more serious intrusion on his personal liberty than is allowable on mere suspicion of criminal activity.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 502. Thus, \u201cthe consent was tainted by the illegality [of the seizure] and was ineffective to justify the [further detention].\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 507-08.</p>\n<p id=\"b909-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b909-6\">Thomas also contends that the identifications were tainted by overly suggestive procedures. The evidence supports that contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b909-7\">\u201cThe practice of showing suspects singly to persons for the purpose of identification, and not as part of a lineup, has been widely condemned.\u201d <em>Stovall v. Denno, </em>388 U.S. 293, 302 (1967) (footnote omitted). On appeal, we must determine whether under the totality of the surrounding circumstances the confrontation \u201cwas so unnecessarily suggestive and conducive to irreparable mistaken identification that [Thomas] was denied due process of law.\u201d <em>Id.; see also Palmer v. Peyton, </em>359 F.2d 199 (4th Cir. 1960).</p>\n<p id=\"b909-8\">The evidence proved that the police presented Thomas alone to Harris while Thomas was handcuffed in a police car and after telling Harris that they had caught the culprit. \u201cIt is hard to imagine a situation more clearly conveying the suggestion to the witness that the one presented is believed guilty by the police.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Wade, </em>388 U.S. 218, 234 (1967). Exigent circumstances did not exist. <em>See Stovall, </em>388 U.S. at 302. The circumstances were such that the police did not have to show Thomas singly to the victim. They could have used identification procedures that were not suggestive. \u201cRegardless of how the initial misidentification comes about, the witness thereafter is apt to retain in his memory the image of the [showup] rather than of the person actually seen, reducing the trustworthiness of subsequent lineup or courtroom identification.\u201d <em>Simmons </em>v. <em>United Slates, </em>390 U.S. 377, 383-84 (1968). <em>See also Moore v. Illinois, </em>434 U.S. 220, 224-25 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b909-9\">Moreover, prior to the preliminary hearing, the police told the victim that the suspect who was being presented in court had confessed to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"868\">*868</page-number>the crime. The Supreme Court has condemned this type of conduct\u2019, stating, \u201c[t]he chance of misidentification is also heightened if the police indicate to the witness that they have other evidence that [the person in the showup] committed the crime.\u201d <em>Simmons, </em>390 U.S. at 383.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b910-5\">Persons who conduct the identification procedure may suggest, intentionally or unintentionally, that they expect the witness to identify the accused. Such a suggestion, coming from a police officer or prosecutor, can lead a witness to make a mistaken identification. The witness then will be predisposed to adhere to this identification in subsequent testimony at trial.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b910-6\"><em>Moore, </em>434 U.S. at 224-25.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-7\">Later, at the preliminary hearing, another identification procedure was employed that was not only tainted by the previous suggestive showup, but was itself also unnecessarily suggestive. The victim was asked to identify her assailant in a courtroom where Thomas was the only person dressed in jail garb, standing a few feet away next to his lawyer.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-8\">The pervasive suggestiveness of the identification procedures far outweighs the factors generally recognized in <em>Neil </em>v. <em>Biggers, </em>409 U.S. 188, 199-200 (1972), that are used to determine reliability of the identification.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b910-9\">\u201cThe trial [that] determine[d] the accused\u2019s fate [was] not . . . that in the courtroom but that at the pretrial confrontation, with the State aligned against the accused, the witness the sole jury, and the accused unprotected against the overreaching, intentional or unintentional, and with little or no effective appeal from the judgment there rendered by the witness \u2014 \u2018that\u2019s the man.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b910-10\"><em>Moore, </em>434 U.S. at 225 (quoting <em>United States </em>v. <em>Wade, </em>388 U.S. 218, 235-36 (1967)). Harris\u2019 opportunity to see and know her assailant was not so clear and certain as to outweigh the significant taint of the suggestive procedures.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b905-7\"> The Commonwealth\u2019s evidence at the suppression hearing was doubtful in several respects. At the suppression hearing the officer testified using two and a half pages of notes that were designated as Commonwealth\u2019s Exhibit 3. He testified as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b905-8\">Q. Officer Scotting, the notes you used to refresh your recollection, when did you prepare those notes?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b905-9\">A. As soon as I took Mr. Thomas back to the scene and I was notified he was to be transported.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b905-10\">Q. Have you made another set of notes with respect to the same transaction?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b905-11\">A. I don\u2019t understand.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b905-12\">Q. Did you make another set of notes that were in connection with the same time that you apprehended Mr. Thomas?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b905-13\">A. I don\u2019t recall. These are the notes that came out of my notebook, and I don\u2019t recall right at this moment whether I duplicated these for the detective or whether I just rehandwritten them. Sometimes our copier machine doesn\u2019t work. These are the notes I write on the scene. These are my notebook paper.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b905-14\">Later a detective informed the court that Officer Scotting had given him another set of notes which were a page and a half in length and marked Commonwealth\u2019s Exhibit 4. Scotting then admitted that Exhibit 4 had been written at the scene and that he had prepared Exhibit 3 at some later time to \u201cgive me an overall view of what\u2019s going on.\u201d The notes marked Exhibit 3 were prepared at the detective bureau after Thomas had been delivered to the police department. One set of notes states that Scotting was told that the suspect was seen wearing a woman\u2019s red and white night shirt. The other contains no reference to that description.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b907-10\"> The victim who was allowed to view Thomas at her residence also stated that Thomas was handcuffed while he was in the automobile. The trial judge, implicitly found he was handcuffed, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b907-11\">I will grant you that usually putting somebody in the back of a police car with handcuffs on is tantamount to arrest.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
