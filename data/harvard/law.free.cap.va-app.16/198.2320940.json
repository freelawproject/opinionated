She contends on appeal that the evidence was insufficient to support her conviction. We disagree and affirm the decision of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-6\">Under familiar principles of appellate review, we examine the evidence in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, granting to it all reasonable inferences fairly deducible therefrom. <em>Martin v. Commonwealth, 4 </em>Va. App. 438, 443, 358 S.E.2d 415, 418 (1987). The judgment of a trial court, sitting without a jury, is entitled to the same weight as a jury verdict and will be disturbed only if plainly wrong or without evidence to support it. <em>Id. </em>The credibility of a witness, the weight accorded the testimony, and the inferences to be drawn from proven facts are matters solely for the factfinder\u2019s determination. <em>Long v. Commonwealth, </em>8 Va. App. 194, 199, 379 S.E.2d 473, 476 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b241-7\">The evidence disclosed that, on January 21, 1991 at approximately 10:45 p.m., Officer H. E. Fawley, Jr. (Fawley) \u201cstopped\u201d defendant for a traffic infraction as she \u201cpulled up into the driveway\u201d of her \u201cbabysitter\u2019s house.\u201d At Fawley\u2019s request, defendant took a seat in the police vehicle while he prepared a summons. She complained that she was \u201clate,\u201d \u201cin a hurry,\u201d noted that her husband was a \u201cmilitary policeman\u201d and asked Fawley to \u201cjust cut her a break.\u201d Although Fawley refused her request, he did permit defendant to \u201cgo . . . explain to [the babysitter] that [she was] going to be a couple of minutes . . . and come back.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b241-8\">Upon her return, defendant again questioned Fawley\u2019s intentions and he confirmed that he was \u201cstill issuing ... a summons.\u201d Defendant then announced that she was \u201cgoing to get [her] baby,\u201d \u201cjumped out of the car\u201d and \u201cstarted walking fast towards the house.\u201d In response, Fawley exited his vehicle and ordered her \u201cback to [his] car,\u201d \u201cat which time . . . she put her hands down . . . balled her fists . . . straightened up\u201d and \u201cjust started screaming at [him].\u201d When Fawley cautioned defendant that he was \u2018 \u2018going to place [her] under arrest for disorderly conduct\u201d if she did not \u201ccalm down,\u201d she protested, \u201cyou ain\u2019t going to do nothing to me\u201d and demanded the presence of a \u201creal policeman,\u201d \u201cscreaming the whole time.\u201d Thinking that defendant \u201cwas going to fight,\u201d Fawley arrested her for the subject offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>Police Officer Ronald S. Dunn (Dunn), on vehicular patrol \u201cseveral blocks away\u201d at the time of the incident, testified that he \u201cheard a woman screaming,\u201d investigated and found defendant \u201cscreaming at the location where . . . Fawley had her stopped.\u201d Dunn recalled that defendant was \u201cvery boisterous,\u201d causing \u201ca whole lot of commotion,\u201d claiming that the officers were \u201cbreaking her bones,\u201d \u201cbrutalizing her,\u201d and \u201cscreaming . . . that she wanted a real cop.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b242-5\">Virginia Beach City Code \u00a7 23-14 provides that a \u201cperson is guilty of disorderly conduct ... if, with the intent to cause public inconvenience, annoyance or alarm, or recklessly creating a risk thereof, he: (1) In any street, highway, ... or while ... in a public place, engages in conduct having a direct tendency to cause acts of violence by the person ... at whom, individually, such conduct is directed . . . .\u201d <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 18.2-415. The \u201cquestion as to whether a particular act is disorderly conduct depends largely on the facts in the particular case, and in the determination of such question not only the nature of the particular act should be considered but also the time and place of its occurrence as well as all the surrounding circumstances.\u201d <em>Collins v. City of Norfolk, </em>186 Va. 1, 5, 41 S.E.2d 448, 450 (1947).</p>\n<p id=\"b242-6\">Defendant\u2019s argument that the City failed to prove the requisite elements of the offense ignores both the circumstances and the plain language of the ordinance. Defendant defied the police officer\u2019s order to remain seated in his automobile while he prepared the traffic summons, \u201cjumped out,\u201d and became loud and uncooperative, refusing to \u201ccalm down.\u201d Such willful, intemperate and provocative conduct, in response to proper law enforcement activity, audible for several blocks and visible from a public street, clearly evinced the intent or recklessness contemplated by the ordinance. Because Fawley reasonably \u201cfelt as though [he] was going to have to fight\u201d to subdue defendant, her behavior had \u201ca direct tendency to cause acts of violence by the person ... at whom [it was] directed.\u201d <em>See Burgess </em>v. <em>City of Virginia Beach, 9 </em>Va. App. 163, 167-68, 385 S.E.2d 59, 61 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b242-7\">Defendant\u2019s assertion that the incident did not occur \u201cin a public place,\u201d but in \u201ca driveway\u201d on \u201cprivate property,\u201d is also without merit. The trial judge, \u201c[r]esolving the conflict in the evidence,\u201d made a specific factual finding that the fracas \u201coccurred in a public place.\u201d This conclusion finds ample support in the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-8\">Accordingly, the judgment of the trial court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-9\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b243-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>Willis, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b243-5\">Elder, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AR4\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-6\">1 respectfully disagree with the majority\u2019s conclusion as to the sufficiency of the evidence in this case. The Virginia Beach City Code section at issue, \u00a7 23-14, tracks the language of Virginia Code \u00a7 18.2-415. The City Code proscribes only \u201cconduct having a direct tendency to cause acts of violence by the person ... at whom, individually, such conduct is directed.\u201d In addition, it expressly states that \u201cthe conduct prohibited under [this section] shall not be deemed to include the utterance or display of any words.\u201d After excluding appellant\u2019s loud statements as required by the statute, the remaining evidence simply does not support the conclusion that appellant\u2019s behavior had a direct tendency to incite Officer Fawley to violence.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-7\">Officer Fawley testified that, while he was attempting to write appellant a summons, she jumped out of his police car and screamed at him. Fie also testified that she verbally resisted his efforts to issue her a traffic summons by continuing to scream, even after he warned her that he would arrest her for disorderly conduct if she did not calm down. When she refused to comply, Fawley placed her under arrest. Officer Dunn then arrived on the scene and held appellant\u2019s arms \u201clightly [behind] her back.\u201d He testified that \u201cthere was no need for any force because she wasn\u2019t offering any kind of resistance . . .[, although] she was still screaming as loud as she could ... .\u201d Although Officer Fawley testified that he \u2018 \u2018felt as though [he] was going to have to fight\u201d to subdue appellant, he admitted that \u201c[s]he didn\u2019t fight.\u201d He also testified that he personally was \u201cvery calm the whole time.\u201d Both officers testified that appellant never threatened to use force against them and never offered any physical resistance other than getting out of Fawley\u2019s car with the stated purpose of getting her baby out of the house. In addition, appellant did not attempt to flee the scene and did not resist when Officer Dunn held her arms lightly behind her back. Even viewed in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, the evidence in this case is insufficient to show that appellant\u2019s behavior, excluding her words as we must under the statute, had a direct tendency to cause violence. I would reverse and dismiss.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
