Winston (defendant) was convicted of two counts of distribution of cocaine. He complains on appeal that the trial court erred (1) in admitting into evidence an unauthenticated copy of a certificate of analysis and (2) in refusing a jury instruction on accommodation distribution. We find no error and affirm the convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b944-12\">The record discloses that, on May 29, 1991, an informant introduced defendant to two Prince William County police detectives. The informant advised defendant that Detective Sandra Exum was a \u201cuser of crack cocaine\u201d interested in purchasing the drug. Acting \u201cthrough\u201d the informant, Exum arranged a \u201c$100 buy\u201d from defendant, who assured that he could \u201cget . . . some crack cocaine,\u201d although he \u201cdid not have it on him.\u201d Defendant then joined the group <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"903\">*903</page-number>in the informant's vehicle and directed them to a residence that defendant alone entered, returning with the cocaine. As defendant \u2018 \u2018went to hand\u201d the substance to the informant, Exum \u201ctook\u201d it from defendant and passed the money to the informant, who \u201cgave it\u201d to defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b945-5\">On June 10, 1991, the detectives and the informant again met defendant, also as arranged by the informant. Defendant arrived driving the informant\u2019s automobile, retrieved a small package from the trunk arid \u201chanded it\u201d to the informant with instructions to \u201ctake care of Sandy (Exum),\u201d \u201cfix [her] up good.\u201d While defendant walked to a nearby store to purchase cigarettes, the informant passed the drugs to Exum in exchange for $100, which was given to defendant on his return.</p>\n<p id=\"b945-6\">Defendant testified that he was \u201cdating\u201d the informant during this period and was \u201chelping\u201d her \u201cleave drugs alone.\u201d Although defendant recalled meeting the detectives, \u201cfriends\u201d of the informant, on each occasion, he denied involvement in the transactions.</p>\n<p id=\"b945-7\">At trial, the evidence with respect to the second distribution offense included testimony of the chemist that analyzed that cocaine. However, no chemist similarly appeared relative to the first sale, and the Commonwealth presented only a \u201cCertificate of Analysis\u201d (certificate), designated, \u201cCOPY,\u201d in the upper right-hand corner, which reported the results of the related laboratory tests. Defendant objected to the admission of this certificate and moved for its suppression, contending that the filing of the \u2018 \u2018copy\u2019 \u2019 with the trial court did not satisfy the requirements of Code \u00a7 19.2-187.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b945-8\">Following argument and consideration of the motion, including examination of the challenged certificate, the trial court determined that the document was not a \u201ccopy\u201d but, rather, a \u201cduplicate original\u201d and overruled the objection. We agree that, though marked \u201cCOPY,\u201d the filing of the certificate in issue complied with the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b946-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"904\">*904</page-number>The contents of a \u201cwritten report offered to prove the results of testing or of an analysis would generally be inadmissible hearsay evidence,\u201d absent authentication and verification by \u201cthe person who conducted the testing or prepared the report.\u201d <em>Myrick v. Commonwealth, </em>13 Va. App. 333, 336-37, 412 S.E.2d 176, 178 (1991); <em>Gray v. Commonwealth, </em>220 Va. 943, 945, 265 S.E.2d 705, 706 (1980). However, Code \u00a7 19.2-187 \u201cimposes a condition for the exoneration of an otherwise hearsay document from the application of the hearsay rule, thus making that document admissible.\u201d <em>Basfield v. Commonwealth, </em>11 Va. App. 122, 124, 398 S.E.2d 80, 81 (1990); <em>Myrick, </em>13 Va. App. at 338, 412 S.E.2d at 178. Because this statute \u201cdeals with criminal matters, and it undertakes to make admissible evidence which otherwise\u201d might be objectionable, it \u201cshould be construed strictly against the Commonwealth and in favor of the accused.\u201d <em>Gray, </em>220 Va. at 945, 265 S.E.2d at 706; <em>Myrick, </em>13 Va. App. at 337-38, 412 S.E.2d at 178.</p>\n<p id=\"b946-5\">Defendant contends that the filing of a \u201ccopy\u201d of the certificate with the court, in lieu of the original, failed to strictly comply with the requirements of Code \u00a7 19.2-187. A similar argument was addressed by a panel of this Court in <em>Myrick </em>as \u201ca \u2018best evidence\u2019 question, which is whether a copy of the certificate of analysis qualifies as an original or can be filed in lieu of the original for the purposes\u201d of Code \u00a7 19.2-187. <em>Myrick, </em>13 Va. App. at 338, 412 S.E.2d at 179. However, if the disputed document constitutes an original, application of the best evidence rule is unnecessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b946-6\">The certificate in issue was found to be a \u201cduplicate original\u201d by the trial court. Duplicate originals are \u201cmade at the same time,\u201d \u201cby the same [mechanical] impression,\u201d and each is an \u201cexact counterpart of the other.\u201d <em>Chesapeake &amp; O. Ry. </em>v. <em>F.W. Stock &amp; Sons, </em>104 Va. 97, 101, 51 S.E. 161, 162 (1905). A duplicate original is accorded the same dignity as an original and, \u201cif otherwise proper,\u201d similarly \u201cadmissible in evidence.\u201d <em>Virginia-Carolina Chem. Co. </em>v. <em>Knight, </em>106 Va. 674, 679, 56 S.E. 725, 727 (1907); <em>Chesapeake &amp; O. Ry., </em>104 Va. at 101, 51 S.E. at 162; Charles E. Friend, <em>The Law of Evidence in Virginia </em>\u00a7 195 (3d ed. 1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b946-7\">In reviewing the trial court\u2019s finding that the certificate in issue was a duplicate original, we must \u201cview the evidence in the light most favorable to ... the prevailing party below,\u201d the Commonwealth, and reverse only if the decision below was \u201cplainly wrong.\u201d <em>Commonwealth v. Grimstead, </em>12 Va. App. 1066, 1067, 407 S.E.2d 47, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"905\">*905</page-number>48 (1991). The certificate was physically before the court, examined by the trial judge and identified as a duplicate certificate by the police officer who received it from the testing laboratory.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Thus, the evidence provided abundant support for the conclusion that the certificate was a duplicate original, itself an original for purposes of Code \u00a7 19.2-187, and admissible into evidence pursuant to the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b947-5\">Defendant\u2019s contention that the evidence supported a jury instruction on accommodation distribution is also without merit. Code \u00a7 18.2-248(D) \u201cprovides for the mitigation of punishment\u201d in those \u201cinstances\u201d of drug distribution \u201cnot by a dealer in drugs, . . . but by an individual citizen . . . motivated by a desire to accommodate a friend, without any intent to profit or to induce or to encourage the use of drugs.\u201d <em>Stillwell </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>219 Va. 214, 219-20, 247 S.E.2d 360, 364 (1978). However, to benefit from this sentencing advantage, the statute, together with Code \u00a7 18.2-263,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> \u201cplace[s] the burden of proving the existence of an accommodation distribution . . . on the shoulders of the defendant,\u201d \u201cby a preponderance of the evidence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 222, 225, 247 S.E.2d at 365, 367.</p>\n<p id=\"b947-6\">It is well settled that if \u201cmore than a mere scintilla\u201d of \u201ccredible evidence in the record supports a proffered instruction . . ., failure to give the instruction is reversible error.\u201d <em>Boone v. Commonwealth, </em>14 Va. App. 130, 132, 415 S.E.2d 250, 251 (1992). \u201c[T]he weight of the credible evidence that will amount to more than a mere scintilla ... is a matter to be resolved on a case-by-case basis\u201d by assessing the evidence in \u201csupport of a proposition\u201d against the \u201cother credible evidence that negates\u201d it. <em>Brandau v. Commonwealth, </em>16 Va. App. 408, 412, 430 S.E.2d 563, 565 (1993). \u201c[T]he appropriate standard of review requires that we view the evidence with respect to the refused instruction in the light most favorable\u201d to defendant. <em>Boone, </em>14 Va. App. at 131, 415 S.E.2d at 251.</p>\n<p id=\"b947-7\">Here, the record is devoid of evidence that defendant acted to accommodate the informant. Assuming that the two shared a personal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"906\">*906</page-number>relationship at the time of the offenses, the evidence clearly established that defendant procured the drugs \u00e1nd delivered them to the informant only to facilitate a sale to, and consumption by, a \u201cdrug-addicted\u201d purchaser, in exchange for consideration from such purchaser. Nothing in these circumstances indicates an accommodation transaction contemplated by Code \u00a7 18.2-248(D), and, accordingly, the instruction in issue was properly refused by the trial court. <em>See Heacock </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>228 Va. 397, 406-07, 323 S.E.2d 90, 95-96 (1984); <em>Schindel v. Commonwealth, </em>219 Va. 814, 818, 252 S.E.2d 302, 304 (1979); <em>Gardner </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>217 Va. 5, 7-8, 225 S.E.2d 354, 356 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b948-5\">For the reasons stated, the judgments of the trial court are affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b948-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b948-7\">Baker, J., and Fitzpatrick, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b945-9\"> In pertinent part, Code \u00a7 19.2-187 reads:</p>\n<p id=\"b945-10\">In any hearing or trial of any criminal offense or in any proceeding brought pursuant to Chapter 22.1 (\u00a7 19.2-386.1 <em>etseq.) </em>of this title, a certificate of analysis of a person performing an analysis or examination, performed in any [approved laboratory] when such certificate is duly attested by such person, shall be admissible in evidence as evidence of the facts therein stated and the results of the analysis or examination referred to therein, provided (i) the certificate of analysis is filed with the clerk of the court hearing the case at least seven days prior to the hearing or trial and (ii) a copy of such certificate is mailed or delivered by the clerk or attorney for the Commonwealth to counsel of record for the accused at least seven days prior to the hearing or trial upon request of such counsel.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b947-8\"> An examination of the certificate clearly shows that it was simultaneously created with the same impression as its counterparts.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b947-9\"> Code \u00a7 18.2-263 provides, <em>inter alia, </em>that, in any prosecution for a violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-248, \u201cit shall not be necessary to negative any exception, excuse, proviso or exemption contained in this article\u201d and places the \u201cburden of proof\u201d of such circumstances \u201cupon the defendant.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
