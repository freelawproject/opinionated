Shull (Shull) challenges the sufficiency of the evidence supporting her conviction for having carnal knowledge of a male child under fifteen years of age (the minor) in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-63. The sole issue on appeal is whether the act of oral sodomy constitutes \u201ccarnal knowledge\u201d under Code \u00a7 18.2-63.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We hold that it does and, accordingly, affirm Shull\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-11\">On June 8, 1991, at approximately 11 p.m., Shull picked up Donnie Lewis (Lewis), age fifteen, and drove him to the minor\u2019s grandfather\u2019s house, where the minor was staying. Shull was thirty-seven years old and the minor, who had been a neighbor of Shull\u2019s and had had a previous \u201crelationship\u201d with Shull, was thirteen.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-12\">Shull parked in the driveway of the minor\u2019s grandfather\u2019s house and waited for the minor to sneak out of the house. Shull and the minor got into the back seat of her car and Lewis sat in the front seat. After a few <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"669\">*669</page-number>minutes, Lewis heard \u201csucking noises.\u201d He looked toward the back seat and saw Shull\u2019s head in the minor\u2019s lap; the minor\u2019s pants were unbuttoned.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-5\">The minor testified that Shull performed \u201coral sex\u201d on him but admitted there had been no sexual intercourse. Shull testified that she did not perform oral sodomy on the victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-6\">At the close of the Commonwealth\u2019s case and again at the close of all the evidence, Shull moved to strike the evidence because there was no evidence of sexual intercourse as required by Code \u00a7 18.2-63. The trial court, finding that Shull had carnal knowledge of the minor by her mouth, denied Shull\u2019s motions to strike.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-7\">Code \u00a7 18.2-63 provides that \u201c[i]f any person carnally know, without the use of force, a child thirteen years of age or older but under fifteen years of age, such person shall be guilty of a Class 4 felony.\u201d Shull contends that performing oral sodomy on a thirteen year old child does not fall within the proscription of the statute. Specifically, she contends that \u201ccarnal knowledge\u201d of a thirteen year old child does not include oral sodomy.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-8\">Our resolution of this issue turns upon the construction of the term \u201ccarnal knowledge,\u201d as used in Code \u00a7 18.2-63. Code \u00a7 18.2-63 does not define the term \u201ccarnal knowledge.\u201d Therefore, in construing the statute, we are guided by principles of statutory construction. \u201cThe plain, obvious, and rational meaning of a statute is always preferred to any curious, narrow or strained construction.\u201d <em>Branch v. </em>Commonwealth, 14 Va. App. 836, 839, 419 S.E.2d 422, 424 (1992). \u201cAlthough penal laws are to be construed strictly, they \u2018ought not to be construed so strictly as to defeat the obvious intention of the legislature.\u2019 \u201d <em>Willis </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>10 Va. App. 430, 441, 393 S.E.2d 405, 411 (1990) (quoting <em>Huddleston v. United States, </em>415 U.S. 814, 831 (1974)). Nor should a statute be construed so that it leads to absurd results. <em>Branch, </em>14 Va. App. at 839, 419 S.E.2d at 424.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-9\">Oral sodomy involving a thirteen year old falls squarely within the plain, obvious, and rational meaning of the statute. The word \u2018 \u2018carnal\u201d means \u201c[plertaining to the body\u201d; \u201ccarnal knowledge\u201d refers to \u201ccoitus, copulation; [or] the act of having <em>sexual bodily </em>connections.\u201d <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>213 (6th ed. 1990) (emphasis added). Based on this definition, the plain meaning of \u201ccarnal knowledge\u201d is any sexual bodily connection, not simply sexual intercourse. Thus, \u201ccarnal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"670\">*670</page-number>knowledge,\u201d as that term is used in Code \u00a7 18.2-63, is not restricted to sexual intercourse.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-5\">We have recognized that \u201c[w]here possible, a statute should be construed with a view toward harmonizing it with other statutes.\u201d <em>Branch, </em>14 Va. App. at 839, 419 S.E.2d at 425. Accordingly, when other Code sections employ the same phraseology, they may be consulted in construing the meaning of a particular statute. <em>Id. </em>Code \u00a7 18.2-361, concerning crimes against nature, specifically proscribes carnal knowledge \u201cby or with the mouth.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Based upon this provision, the term \u201ccarnal knowledge\u201d includes oral sodomy. <em>See Ryan </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>219 Va. 439, 445, 247 S.E.2d 698, 702 (1978); <em>Ashby, </em>208 Va. at 444, 158 S.E.2d at 658.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-6\">To construe Code \u00a7 18.2-63 to prohibit only sexual intercourse with children would lead to an absurd result not intended by the legislature. This provision was enacted to prevent sexual offenses against and sexual exploitation of children. Sexual exploitation of children is not limited to the act of sexual intercourse. For this reason, Shull\u2019s construction of the statute, limiting \u2018 \u2018camal knowledge\u2019 \u2019 to sexual intercourse, unreasonably narrows the phrase \u201ccamal knowledge\u201d and defeats the legislative intent behind the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-7\">Contending that the legislature could not have intended Code \u00a7 18.2-63 to proscribe oral sodomy, Shull draws a comparison between the classification of the offense in Code \u00a7 18.2-63 (Class 4 felony) and Code \u00a7 18.2-361 (Class 6 felony). Shull asserts that \u201cby providing distinguishable punishments in the two statutes ... the legislature intended ... to prohibit [different] sexual activities.\u201d We find no basis for Shull\u2019s construction. In providing distinguishable punishments in these provisions, the legislature intended to prohibit the same activities, but to distinguish between different age groups in determining punishment. Code \u00a7 18.2-63, unlike Code \u00a7 18.2-361, proscribes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"671\">*671</page-number>\u201ccarnal knowledge\u201d of a child.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In setting a more severe punishment in Code \u00a7 18.2-63, the legislature intended to punish more severely the same act when it was committed against a child.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-5\">When the sufficiency of the evidence is challenged on appeal, we must view the evidence and any reasonable inferences fairly deducible therefrom in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth. <em>Traverso v. </em>Commonwealth, 6 Va. App. 172, 176, 366 S.E.2d 719, 721 (1988). Viewed in this light, the evidence showed that \u201c[Shull\u2019s] mouth came in contact with [the minor\u2019s] penis.\u201d The trial court concluded from the evidence that Shull had oral sodomy with the minor. Therefore, the trial court\u2019s conclusion that Shull had carnal knowledge of the minor by the mouth in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-63 was supported by the evidence and was not plainly wrong. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b713-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b713-7\">Elder, J., and Fitzpatrick, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b710-13\"> \u201cAlthough the act for which [Shull] was convicted is, strictly speaking, fellatio rather than sodomy (Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 743, 1563 (4th ed. 1951)), the act is usually referred to as sodomy and we will use that term in this opinion.\u201d <em>Ashby v. </em>Commonwealth, 208 Va. 443, 444 n.1, 158 S.E.2d 657, 657 n.1 (1968), <em>cert. </em>denied, 393 U.S. 1111 (1969).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b712-8\"> This provision reads, in part:</p>\n<p id=\"b712-9\">\u00a7 18.2-361. Crimes against nature. \u2014 If any person shall carnally know in any manner any brute animal, or carnally know any male or female person by the anus or by or with the mouth, or voluntarily submit to such carnal knowledge, he or she shall be guilty of a Class 6 felony; provided that if a parent commits such an act with his or her child, and such child is at least thirteen but less than fifteen years of age at the time of the offense, such parent shall be guilty of a Class 3 felony.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b713-8\"> Code \u00a7 18.2-361 elevates the offense to a Class 3 felony when committed by a parent against his or her child. This distinction further supports our conclusion that the legislature has demonstrated its intent to punish more severely the same sexual offenses when committed against children. Here, the legislature has assessed a higher penalty when the offense is committed by a <em>parent.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
