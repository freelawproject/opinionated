He contends that the commission erred in refusing to admit an autopsy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"967\">*967</page-number>and related medical report as after-discovered evidence. We agree and reverse the decision of the commission.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1009-5\">The record discloses that claimant was diagnosed with coal workers\u2019 pneumoconiosis on December 20, 1989, and filed an application for benefits on November 2, 1990. At a subsequent hearing before a deputy commissioner (deputy), claimant submitted three readings of an x-ray film which indicated the presence of pneumoconiosis. His employer, Oakwood Mining, Inc. (employer), produced three negative readings of the same film. To resolve the issue, the deputy forwarded these x-rays to the Medical College of Virginia Occupational/ Pulmonary Committee (committee) for an independent medical evaluation. However, before that assessment was completed, claimant died of a heart ailment, apparently unrelated to pneumoconiosis.</p>\n<p id=\"b1009-6\">Claimant\u2019s counsel immediately notified the deputy of claimant\u2019s death and requested that he \u201chold this case open\u201d until receipt of a copy of the \u201cautopsy report.\u201d In denying the motion, the deputy reminded counsel that the record had been \u201cheld only for ... the .. . committee\u2019s reading\u201d and, moreover, that the commission was \u201callowed only to consider x-ray evidence of the disease.\u201d Shortly thereafter, the committee reported a \u201cnegative reading\u201d for the disease. However, to afford counsel an opportunity to \u201ccross examine members of the committee,\u201d the deputy did not \u201cclose\u201d the record until June 15, 1991.</p>\n<p id=\"b1009-7\">The autopsy report was filed with the commission under cover letter from claimant\u2019s counsel dated May 30, 1991, and indicated the presence of \u201cSimple coal workers\u2019 pneumoconiosis (CWP), mild.\u201d It was followed by a medical report, authored by Dr. Emory Robinette and dated June 4, 1991, which referenced Robinette\u2019s previous \u201cradio-graphic interpretation\u201d and concluded that the \u201cpathological findings\u201d of the autopsy were \u201cconsistent with the radiographic interrelations of 1/0\u201d (compensable stage 1 pneumoconiosis). Nevertheless, the deputy refused to allow consideration of either the autopsy or the related report and denied the application.</p>\n<p id=\"b1010-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"968\">*968</page-number>Claimant appealed, and the commission affirmed, ruling that, \u201cin the absence of need for consideration of evidence other than x-ray evidence which would satisfy the ILO<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> standards, as required by statute, there was no reason for consideration of an autopsy report or other medical evidence.\u201d The commission further noted that \u201cevidence of the condition of a miner\u2019s lung determined upon autopsy would not be, in itself, a basis for determining compensability under . . . Code \u00a7 65.1-56.1 [now Code \u00a7 65.2-504].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1010-5\">Former Code \u00a7 65.1-56.1, as amended in 1990, provided that benefits for coal workers\u2019 pneumoconiosis shall be awarded when the disease is \u201cmedically determined from <em>radiographic evidence </em>and classified under [ILO standards].\u201d (emphasis added). Prior to the amendment, former Code \u00a7 65.1-56.1 allowed benefits when the disease was \u201cmedically determined to be in the [first, second or third] category,\u201d without specific reference to \u201cradiographic evidence.\u201d <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> However, the provision of Code \u00a7 65.1-56.1, as amended, requiring that the diagnosis be based upon \u201cradiographic evidence,\u201d does not proscribe or restrict consideration by the medical expert of other evidence also relevant and appropriate to the radiographic studies. Such limitation would preclude correlation by the expert of all evidence, irrespective of its importance to a comprehensive interpretation of the \u201cx-ray evidence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1010-6\">The radiographic determination contemplated by the statute is obviously dependent upon the findings of expert medical witnesses. Like all opinion evidence, these conclusions oftentimes depend upon \u201chearsay factual information\u201d indispensable to a comprehensive inquiry by the expert. <em>Bowers </em>v. <em>Huddleston, </em>241 Va. 83, 86, 399 S.E.2d 811, 813 (1991); <em>Swiney </em>v. <em>Overby, </em>237 Va. 231, 233, 377 S.E.2d 372, 374 (1989); Code \u00a7 8.01-401.1. By statute, the sources of such ordinarily inadmissible \u201cfacts and data\u201d may be revealed to the fact finder in the context of expert opinion, and disclosure of the information itself \u201cmay in any event be required ... on cross-examination.\u201d Code \u00a7 8.01-401.1; <em>see McMunn v. Tatum, </em>237 Va. 558, 565-66 nn.2-3, 379 S.E.2d 908, 912 nn.2-3 (1989); Charles E. Friend, <em>The Law of </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"969\">*969</page-number><em>Evidence in Virginia </em>\u00a7 217 (3d ed. 1988). Otherwise, the foundation of the opinion and its attendant reliability could not be fully and properly measured. Commission Rule 1, which expressly countenances \u201chearsay evidence\u201d in furtherance of the \u201csubstantial rights of the parties,\u201d accommodates this principle. <em>See Board of Supervisors v. </em>Martin, 3 Va. App. 139, 144, 348 S.E.2d 540, 542 (1986), <em>appeal dismissed, </em>363 S.E.2d 703 (Va. 1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b1011-5\">By declining to permit consideration of the autopsy evidence in conjunction with the several conflicting opinions from the radiographic evidence, through both direct and cross-examination of the experts, the commission adopted an unnecessarily narrow construction of former Code \u00a7 65.1-56.1, inconsistent with Code \u00a7 8.01-401.1 and well-established rules of evidence. We acknowledge that the \u201cconstruction accorded a statute by public officials charged with its administration and enforcement is entitled to be given weight by the court.\u201d <em>Peyton v. Williams, </em>206 Va. 595, 600, 145 S.E.2d 147, 151 (1965). However, \u201c[wjhen an agency\u2019s statutory interpretation conflicts with the language of the statute or when the interpretation has not been consistently and regularly applied, the usual deference . . . should be withheld.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>May Bros., Inc., </em>11 Va. App. 115, 119, 396 S.E.2d 695, 697 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b1011-6\">It is well established that a statute \u201cshould be construed with a view toward harmonizing it with other statutes\u201d and consistent with \u201cfundamental law, especially where no violence is done to the language of the statute and such interpretation satisfies its terms.\u201d <em>Morris v. Morris, 4 </em>Va. App. 539, 543-44, 359 S.E.2d 104, 107 (1987). When confronted with \u201cpotential conflict\u201d in statutes, \u201cit is this court\u2019s duty to construe those provisions in a manner which would give full force and effect to both provisions\u201d and avoid \u201can injustice on the parties.\u201d <em>Cooper v. Occoquan Land Development Corp., </em>8 Va. App. 1, 6, 377 S.E.2d 631, 633 (1989), <em>rev\u2019d on other grounds, </em>239 Va. 363, 389 S.E.2d 464 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b1011-7\">An expert\u2019s consideration of \u201cfacts and data\u201d appropriate to a radiographic interpretation is at once consonant with both statutory and case law and the mandate of former Code \u00a7 65.1-56.1. Thus, the autopsy report and related \u201cother medical evidence\u201d were admissible for consideration by the commission in conjunction with the controverted opinions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1012-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"970\">*970</page-number>However, for such evidence to be proper in this instance, it must also qualify as after-discovered evidence. Commission Rule (2)(c) provides, in pertinent part, that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1012-5\">[a]ny petition for reopening of the case and taking of additional testimony will only be favorably acted upon by the Full Commission when it appears to the Commission that such course is absolutely necessary and advisable and also when the party requesting the same is able to conform to the rules prevailing in the courts of this State for the introduction of after-discovered evidence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1012-6\">It is well established that a party seeking to introduce after-discovered evidence \u201cbears the burden to establish\u201d that it</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1012-7\">(1) appears to have been discovered subsequent to the trial; (2) could not have been secured for use at the trial in the exercise of reasonable diligence by the movant; (3) is not merely cumulative, corroborative or collateral; and (4) is material, and such as should produce opposite results on the merits at another trial.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1012-8\"><em>Odum v. </em>Commonwealth, 225 Va. 123, 130, 301 S.E.2d 145, 149 (1983); <em>Carter </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>10 Va. App. 507, 512, 393 S.E.2d 639, 642 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b1012-9\">The autopsy report revealed the presence of \u201cSimple coal workers\u2019 pneumoconiosis (CWP), mild.\u201d Dr. Robinette considered this report, and related findings, as he interpreted the radiographic evidence and found the \u201cpathological findings of simple coal workers\u2019 pneumoconiosis\u201d reflected in the autopsy report \u201cconsistent with the radiographic interrelations of 1/0.\u201d This perspective was unavailable to any expert without the autopsy report which followed claimant\u2019s death and clearly enhanced the reliability of the radiographic interpretation, suggesting the likelihood of a different result if properly considered on remand. <em>See Michigan &amp; Vicinity Conference Bd. </em>v. <em>Enterprise Foundry Co., </em>321 Mich. 265, 272-73, 32 N.W.2d 515, 518 (1948); <em>Freeman United Coal Mining Co. v. Industrial Comm\u2019n, </em>224 Ill. App. 3d 778, 782-90, 587 N.E.2d 1141, 1144-49 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b1012-10\">Accordingly, because the commission erroneously excluded the use of evidence relevant and material to the proceedings, we reverse its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"971\">*971</page-number>decision and remand to permit appropriate consideration of the autopsy report in conjunction with the radiographic interpretations.</p>\n<p id=\"b1013-4\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1013-5\">Coleman, J., and Koontz, J.,<footnotemark>**</footnotemark> concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b1008-11\"> By order entered this date, upon motion of appellant\u2019s counsel, the Court substituted Phyllis Helen Cox, administratrix of the estate of Arnold Cox, as the proper party appellant in this case. However, for purposes of consistency, the original style of the case is retained herein.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1009-8\"> Because we reverse and remand on this issue, we do not address claimant\u2019s remaining assignments of error.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1010-7\"> International Labour Office Classification of Radiographs of the Pneumoconioses (1980).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1010-8\"> Claimant contends that this statute, in effect at the time of the first communication of the disease, governs his claim. <em>See Island Creek Coal Co. </em>v. Breeding, 6 Va. App. 1, 10, 365 S.E.2d 782,787 (1988). Because we find the distinction between the statutes immaterial for purposes of our decision, we decline to address this issue.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b1013-6\"> When the case was argued, Judge Koontz presided.
