The Department contends: (1) the commission erred in reversing the deputy commissioner\u2019s credibility-based findings of fact; (2) the commission ignored the credible evidence and erroneously found \u201cclear and unequivocal\u201d evidence sufficient to support equitable estoppel; (3) the evidence does not prove equitable estoppel; and (4) the commission erred in applying the doctrine of estoppel to a state agency. For the reasons that follow, we affirm the commission\u2019s award.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-11\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-12\">At the evidentiary hearing before the deputy commissioner, the evidence proved that Dean sustained a work-related back injury on July 5, 1989, while employed as a communications operator for the Department. Dr. C.D. Moore, Jr., diagnosed her injury as a low back strain with lumbar neuropathy. An award was entered granting Dean compensation benefits beginning July 13, 1989, and continuing during her incapacity. Dr. Moore elected to treat Dean\u2019s injury conservatively and authorized Dean to return to work on July 17. However, Dean continued to experience chronic low back pain and some leg pain. On June 17, 1991, while at work, Dean experienced an onset of severe back and leg pain. She was seen again by Dr. Moore and by Dr. James M. Vascik, a neurological surgeon, who diagnosed her condition as a herniated disc and scheduled her for surgery on July 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>Betty Nuckols, the Department\u2019s coordinator for leave and workers\u2019 compensation claims, testified that Dean\u2019s husband had a telephone conversation with her on June 21 concerning Dean\u2019s problems and asked, \u201cWhat do we need to do?\u201d Nuckols informed him that she, Nuckols, would file a First Report of Accident and get all the information from the doctors. Several days later and before her surgery, Dean called Nuckols and asked whether she needed to do anything further. Nuckols said, \u2018 \u2018no,... everything was taken care of, they had filed the reports.\u201d In June or early July, Dean also talked with Coleen Vaughan, the claims servicing agency representative. Dean summarized those conversations as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b298-5\">Well, I talked to her several \u2014 on several different occasions, and every time I talked to her she said \u2014 I asked if there was anything else that I needed to do, and she said no, you needed to wait until the panel made the decision \u2014-just wait until the panel made their decision. And then if they denied my claim, at that time I could file for a hearing before the Industrial Commission.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b298-6\">Following these conversations, the Department filed supplemental reports with the commission on July 15 and July 30 relating Dean\u2019s recurring pain to the July 1989 injury. However, on August 1, 1991, the Department refused to pay workers\u2019 compensation benefits, contending that any medical treatment Dean received after July 17, 1989, was not related to her July 5, 1989, compensable injury. On August 8, 1991, Dean filed an application for a hearing in which she alleged a change in condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-7\">H.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-8\">On this evidence, the deputy commissioner held that pursuant to Code \u00a7 65.2-603, Dean was entitled to \u201cmedical attention ... as long as necessary after [the initial] accident\u201d because an award had been entered. However, the deputy commissioner denied Dean\u2019s claim for compensation for work incapacity, finding that her application for change in condition was not filed within twenty-four months from the last day for which compensation was paid as required by Code \u00a7 65.2-708. Finding \u201cno scheming or calculating on the part of the [Department] or [insurance] carrier in which they calculated to induce or did in fact induce [Dean] not to file her claim,\u201d the deputy commissioner further held that the Department was not estopped from asserting that Dean\u2019s application for a change in condition was time-barred.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>On review, the commission held that Dean \u201ccarried the burden of proving by clear and unequivocal evidence that the [Department] made representations on which she relied and is estopped from invoking the time limitation of Code \u00a7 65.2-708.\u201d Thus, the commission reversed the deputy commissioner\u2019s denial of an award to Dean for compensation for temporary, total work incapacity.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-6\">\u201cGenerally, the full commission remains free to make different findings of fact than those made by the deputy commissioner.\u201d <em>Williams v. Auto Brokers, </em>6 Va. App. 570, 573, 370 S.E.2d 321, 323 (1988). \u201cIt lies within the commission\u2019s authority to determine the facts and the weight of the evidence, and its findings in that regard, when supported by credible evidence, will not be disturbed on appeal.\u201d <em>Rose </em>v. <em>Red\u2019s Hitch &amp; Trailer Servs., Inc., </em>11 Va. App. 55, 60, 396 S.E.2d 392, 395 (1990) (citation omitted). However, in making findings of fact, \u201cthe full commission may not arbitrarily disregard the [deputy commissioner\u2019s credibility-based] finding unless it is evident from the record that there existed some basis for the full commission\u2019s different interpretation of the witness\u2019 credibility.\u201d <em>Williams, 6 </em>Va. App. at 573, 370 S.E.2d at 323. We disagree with the assertion that the commission reversed findings of fact made by the deputy commissioner that were based upon his assessment of the credibility of witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-7\">The only credibility-based finding of fact the deputy commissioner made was that \u201c[a]fter having had an opportunity to observe the demeanor of Betty Nuckols, and upon considering her testimony, [the deputy commissioner] would have serious difficulty with the proposition that Nuckols, either singly, or in concert with representatives of the servicing agency, either schemed or calculated to induce the claimant not to file her claim.\u201d The commission, likewise, found that Nuckols did not have \u201cany intent to prevent the claimant from filing a claim.\u201d In concluding that Dean established the elements of equitable estoppel, the commission did not dispute any of the deputy commissioner\u2019s findings of fact. Instead, the commission concluded that under the test announced in <em>Stuart Circle Hospital v. Alderson, </em>223 Va. 205, 288 S.E.2d 445 (1982) (per curiam), Nuckols\u2019 intent was not dispositive of the issue of estoppel.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>IV</p>\n<p id=\"b300-5\">The Department contends that the commission was without sufficient credible evidence to find clear and unequivocal evidence of equitable estoppel and, further, that the evidence did.not meet the standards required to prove equitable estoppel. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-6\">The witnesses in this case did not contradict each other\u2019s testimony. \u201cWhen the issue is the sufficiency of the evidence and there is no conflict in the evidence, the issue is purely a question of law.\u201d <em>Cibula </em>v. <em>Allied Fibers &amp; </em>Plastics, 14 Va. App. 319, 324, 416 S.E.2d 708, 711 (1992), <em>aff'd, </em>245 Va. 337, 428 S.E.2d 905 (1993). In applying the principles announced by the Supreme Court in <em>Stuart Circle, </em>this Court observed that \u201cproof of a representation, reliance, change of position, and detriment is sufficient to establish equitable estoppel.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 324, 416 S.E.2d at 711. We do not agree with the Department\u2019s argument that Dean was required to establish \u201cassurances of payment, . . . past pattern of conduct, [or] . . . false expectation of payment.\u201d In cases involving equitable estoppel, \u201c[t]he employee\u2019s case is made if the \u2018representation ... did in fact induce the [employee] to refrain from filing [a claim].\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 325, 416 S.E.2d at 711.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-7\">The testimony of Dean and her husband was consistent with the testimony of Nuckols. Nuckols confirmed that they asked her what needed to be done to perfect Dean\u2019s claim and that she advised them. Indeed, Nuckols stated, \u201cI, myself, thought what needed to be done had been done.\u201d She also testified that each time she talked to the Deans, they asked, \u201c \u2018What do we need to do?\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b300-8\">When Dean was asked why she did not file an application for hearing prior to August 5, 1991, she responded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b300-9\">Because I thought everything was taken care of. I was told by my employer and the insurance company that there was nothing else that I needed to do, that everything was taken care of. They assured me that everything had been done to \u2014 for the statute of limitations not to run out on me, that everything was done.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b300-10\">The uncontroverted evidence supports Dean\u2019s contentions that Nuckols\u2019 and Vaughan\u2019s affirmative assurances concerning Dean\u2019s claim were representations that induced Dean to believe that she was in compliance with all workers\u2019 compensation requirements. Dean relied on their assurances and, to her detriment, failed to file a claim. <em>See Cibula, </em>14 Va. App. at 325, 416 S.E.2d at 712. The commission <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>did not err in finding the evidence of estoppel to be clear, precise, and unequivocal.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-5\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b301-6\">Finally, the Department contends that the commission erred in applying the doctrine of estoppel to it, an agency of the Commonwealth. We will not consider this argument because the Department did not raise this issue before the commission. <em>See Green v. Warwick Plumbing &amp; Pleating Corp., 5 </em>Va. App. 409, 413, 364 S.E.2d 4, 6, <em>appeal </em>dismissed, 371 S.E.2d 7 (Va. 1988). Accordingly, we affirm the commission\u2019s award.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b301-8\">Baker, J., and Coleman, X, concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
