(employer) and Continental Insurance Company (carrier) appeal a decision of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Commission<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> (commission) that the claim of Elizabeth B. Shaffer (claimant) was not barred by the applicable statute of limitations. Claimant argues that the commission properly resolved the issue and, further, that employer is estopped from asserting the defense because its conduct induced her \u201cto refrain from filing.\u201d We disagree with the commission and reverse and remand the case for further consideration in accordance with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"705\">*705</page-number>On appellate review, the evidence must be construed in the light most favorable to the party prevailing below. <em>Crisp v. Brown\u2019s Tysons Corner Dodge, Inc., </em>1 Va. App. 503, 504, 339 S.E.2d 916, 916 (1986). Factual findings by the commission that are supported by credible evidence are conclusive and binding upon this Court on appeal. <em>Rose </em>v. <em>Red\u2019s Hitch &amp; Trailer Servs., </em>11 Va. App. 55, 60, 396 S.E.2d 392, 395 (1990); <em>Commonwealth v. Powell, </em>2 Va. App. 712, 714, 347 S.E.2d 532, 533 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b747-5\">Viewed in this perspective, the record discloses that claimant suffered a compensable injury on July 9, 1989, after which employer voluntarily paid compensation benefits. On September 29, 1989, employer filed its initial report of the accident<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> with the commission and, on October 5, 1989, the commission mailed claimant both a \u201cblue letter\u201d and a \u201cworkers\u2019 compensation guide.\u201d <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 65.2-602. Following the accident, claimant executed a \u201cmemorandum of agreement\u201d with the carrier that mistakenly inflated claimant\u2019s \u201caverage weekly wage\u201d and related compensation. When this error was discovered, the carrier adjusted the benefit accordingly and mailed claimant a \u201ccorrected memorandum\u201d; however, it was never signed and returned by her or filed with the commission. During several subsequent conversations between claimant and Karen Jones, a representative of the carrier, the two discussed neither the amended memorandum nor the reduction in benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-6\">Employer terminated payments to claimant on September 10, 1991, and she filed a claim with the commission on September 26, 1991. At the request of the parties, the deputy commissioner considered the application without testimony, \u201con the record\u201d only, and concluded that the claim was \u201cclearly time barred\u201d because it had not been filed within two years of the accident as required by Code \u00a7 65.2-601. On review, however, the full commission reversed, noting that Code \u00a7 65.2-602 \u201cclearly provide[s] that if the Employer\u2019s First Report of Accident is not filed within the statutory ten-day period..., the statute of limitations is tolled until the report is filed.\u201d Thus, since this claim was lodged with the commission on September 26, 1991, within two years of the employer\u2019s initial report of September 29, 1989, it was deemed timely.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"706\">*706</page-number>Employer argues that the claim is governed by former Code \u00a7 65.1-87.1, the statute in effect at the time of claimant\u2019s injury, and the commission, therefore, erred in retroactively applying the more recent Code \u00a7 65.2-602.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>See Island Creek Coal Co. v. Breeding, </em>6 Va. App. 1, 10, 365 S.E.2d 782, 787 (1988). Claimant counters that only procedural amendments that did \u2018 \u2018not effect vested rights\u2019 \u2019 differentiated the statutes and that the commission properly applied the later statute. <em>See Cohen v. Fairfax Hosp. Ass\u2019n, </em>12 Va. App. 702, 705, 407 S.E.2d 329, 331 (1991). We find, however, that the similarities between Code \u00a7 65.2-602 and former Code \u00a7 65.1-87.1, not the distinctions, resolve this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-5\">Both statutes tolled the limitations period when the employer \u201creceived notice of an accident resulting in compensable injury\u201d and \u201cpaid compensation or wages\u201d to the injured employee, as occurred here, provided \u201csuch conduct\u201d prejudiced \u201cthe rights of [the] employee with respect to the filing of a claim.\u201d Code \u00a7 65.2-602 (former Code \u00a7 65.1-87.1). Code \u00a7 65.2-602 added failure by the employer \u201cto file the report of such accident with the [commission] as required by Code \u00a7 65.2-900,\u201d a circumstance also present here, as further conduct contemplated by the statute. Thus, notice, specified conduct and prejudice are the \u201cthree criteria\u201d that must be established by a claimant seeking relief pursuant to either statute. <em>Hervey </em>v. <em>Newport News Shipbuilding &amp; Dry Dock Co., </em>12 Va. App. 88, 92, 402 S.E.2d 688, 690 (1991). <em>See Maryland Casualty Co. v. Robinson, </em>149 Va. 307, 310, 141 S.E. 225, 226 (1928); <em>Westmoreland Coal Co. </em>v. <em>Coffey, </em>13 Va. App. 446, 448, 412 S.E.2d 209, 210-11 (1991).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b749-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"707\">*707</page-number>We agree with employer that the commission incorrectly construed Code \u00a7 65.2-602 to toll the statute whenever \u201cthe Employer\u2019s First Report of Accident is not filed within the statutory ten-day period.\u201d Like former Code \u00a7 65.1-87.1, assuming notice is sufficiently proven, \u201cprejudice\u201d to the employee remains an indispensable component to tolling under Code \u00a7 65.2-602, which the commission apparently overlooked in this instance. <em>Hervey, </em>12 Va. App. at 92-93, 402 S.E.2d at 691.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-5\">It is uncontroverted that the employer filed the first report of accident on September 29, 1989, and the commission made a factual finding that claimant thereafter received the \u2018 \u2018blue letter\u2019 \u2019 and \u2018 \u2018employees\u2019 guide.\u201d <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 65.2-602 (former Code \u00a7 65.1-87.1). Each statute expressly provided that the \u2018 \u2018rights of an employee shall be deemed not prejudiced if his employer has filed the first report of accident... or he has received after the accident a workers\u2019 compensation guide.\u201d Code \u00a7 65.2-602 (former Code \u00a7 65.1-87.1). Thus, after September 29, 1989, there was \u201ca <em>per se </em>absence of prejudice to the claimant\u201d under either statute. <em>Hervey, </em>12 Va. App. at 92, 402 S.E.2d at 691. However, proof that the employer was delinquent in reporting the accident to the commission does not itself establish the presence of the requisite prejudice from the date of the accident until September 29.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-6\">\u201cWhile the provisions of the Virginia Act are to be liberally construed to see that its benefits are awarded to injured employees, that principle does not authorize the courts to amend, alter or extend its provisions, nor does it require that every claim asserted be allowed.\u201d <em>Bowden v. Newport News Shipbuilding &amp; Dry Dock Co., </em>11 Va. App. 683, 688, 401 S.E.2d 884, 887 (1991). Because the record does not reflect that the commission required claimant to establish that employer\u2019s conduct prejudiced her rights \u201cwith respect to the filing of a claim,\u201d Code \u00a7 65.2-602 (former Code \u00a7 65.1-87.1), we must remand the case for consideration of this circumstance upon the existing record and any additional relevant evidence deemed appropriate.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>See </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"708\">*708</page-number><em>Lucas </em>v. <em>Research Analysis Corp., </em>209 Va. 583, 586, 166 S.E.2d 294, 296 (1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b750-5\">Contrary to claimant\u2019s argument, employer is not estopped from asserting the statute of limitations as a defense. It is well established that the voluntary payment of benefits by an employer does not, standing alone, toll the statute of limitations or estop the employer from availing itself of that defense. <em>Bowden, </em>11 Va. App. at 686-87, 401 S.E.2d at 886; <em>Stuart Circle Hosp. </em>v. <em>Alderson, </em>223 Va. 205, 209, 288 S.E.2d 445, 447 (1982); <em>Clark v. United Airlines, </em>223 Va. 197, 200, 288 S.E.2d 441, 442-43 (1982); <em>see also Cibula v. Allied Fibers &amp; Plastics, </em>14 Va. App. 319, 324, 416 S.E.2d 708, 711 (1992), <em>aff'd, </em>245 Va. 337, 428 S.E.2d 905 (1993). Similarly, failure by the employer to report the accident in accordance with Code \u00a7 65.2-900 neither tolls the statute nor precludes the defense. Such estoppel requires proof of \u201cmisconduct\u201d by the employer or its insurer that \u201cmisled\u201d claimant to her \u201cdetriment.\u201d <em>Hervey, </em>12 Va. App. at 94-95, 402 S.E.2d at 692.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-6\">As noted by the deputy commissioner, this record reveals neither \u201cfraud nor concealment\u201d nor \u201cany act\u201d by the employer \u201cwhich was reasonably calculated to induce or did in fact induce [claimant] to refrain from filing her claim . . . within two years from the date of her injury.\u201d <em>Stuart Circle Hosp., </em>223 Va. at 208, 288 S.E.2d at 446-47; <em>Clark, </em>223 Va. at 200, 288 S.E.2d at 442; <em>Bowden, </em>11 Va. App. at 686, 401 S.E.2d at 886. Thus, the commission properly entertained the defense, erring only in its disposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-7\">Accordingly, the decision of the commission is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-8\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b750-9\">Coleman, J., and Koontz, J.,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b746-12\"> Effective October 1, 1991, Title 65.1 was recodified as Title 65.2.
