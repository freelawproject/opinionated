She alleges that the trial judge erred in overruling her objections to the Commonwealth Attorney\u2019s statements, made before only the trial judge during the sentencing phase of the trial, concerning her rejection of a plea bargain. The Commonwealth contends that appellant is barred from presenting this assignment of error on appeal because she did not request a mistrial at the time the objectionable comments were made.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-9\">Appellant was found guilty by a jury of uttering three forged checks and of grand larceny of the proceeds. The jury recommended a total punishment of forty-five years imprisonment. The trial judge granted appellant\u2019s request to have a presentence report prepared.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-10\">At the sentencing hearing held before a judge, the Commonwealth\u2019s Attorney stated that the presentence report was not favorable to appellant; that she had an extensive criminal record, was an admitted cocaine user and had lied to her probation officer about her employment history. The Commonwealth\u2019s Attorney, Douglas Barry, made several statements during his closing argument to which appellant\u2019s counsel, Gary Hershner, objected:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b446-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>MR. BARRY: . . . .This woman, back before this jury trial, who is a career criminal, was offered a ten-year sentence. She was offered that not because she deserves that \u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b446-6\">MR. HERSHNER: Objection. Objection to relevance, Judge, on sentencing. That\u2019s not proper.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b446-8\">THE COURT: Continue the argument, Mr. Barry.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b446-9\">MR. BARRY: She was offered a ten-year sentence by this Commonwealth\u2019s Attorney, not because that\u2019s what she deserved, but having done trial work for a while, it was thought she would not take the stand, therefore, her record would not come into evidence, and I thought that was a fair offer. Mr. Hershner was not involved in that. She had a very competent attorney in that situation as well, Mr. White. Not only was that laughed at, but as I walked back to my office and she walked back to the jail, she taunted me the entire time about my ridiculous offer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b446-11\">MR. HERSHNER: Objection, Judge. It\u2019s not in evidence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b446-12\">THE COURT: This is the argument stage, Mr. Hershner. You may argue what you want when Mr. Barry gets through.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b446-13\">Go ahead, Mr. Barry.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b446-14\">Hershner made no further objections and did not move for a mistrial. In his own closing, Hershner admitted that the presentence report was \u201cvery bad,\u201d but asked the court to suspend such portion of the jury\u2019s forty-five year sentence so as to leave her with eight and one-half years to serve, which he asserted was the median range according to the sentencing guidelines. The Commonwealth\u2019s Attorney then replied that the median sentence was approximately the sentence that appellant had laughed at when he offered it to her in exchange for a guilty plea prior to the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-15\">The court then imposed the jury\u2019s recommended verdict of forty-five years. In so doing, it stated, \u201cThe Court has reviewed the file. It\u2019s read the letters that have come in and it\u2019s heard the witnesses. The Court also heard the trial. I thought the jury probably was pretty lenient. In any event, I feel that the jury verdict ought to be confirmed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b447-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>I.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-5\">We find that our consideration of appellant\u2019s assignment of error is not barred by her failure to request a mistrial. In so doing, we acknowledge that the Virginia Supreme Court \u201chas repeatedly held that errors assigned because of a prosecutor\u2019s improper comments or conduct during argument will not be considered on appeal unless the accused timely moves for a cautionary instruction or for a mistrial.\u201d <em>Martinez </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>241 Va. 557, 559 n.2, 403 S.E.2d 358, 359 n.2 (1991). Although the Commonwealth cites several cases that require the making of such a motion, or at least require that a cautionary instruction be requested, as a prerequisite to an appeal, all of those cases are distinguishable. The cases cited involved comments made during closing arguments before a jury in the guilt phase of the trial. <em>See id.; Cheng v. Commonwealth, </em>240 Va. 26, 38, 393 S.E.2d 599, 605-06 (1990); <em>Morris </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>14 Va. App. 283, 286-87, 416 S.E.2d 462, 464 (1992) (en banc). The recognized purpose of this requirement is to prevent retrials by calling the error to the attention of the trial judge, who may then caution the jury to disregard the inappropriate remarks.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-6\">In this case, by contrast, the challenged remarks were made before the judge during the sentencing phase of the trial. We find no Supreme Court precedent that requires a judge to give himself or herself a cautionary instruction based on improper comments made in a bench trial in order to preserve that issue for appeal. In addition, the granting of a mistrial based on an error occurring only during the sentencing phase of the trial would result in a waste of judicial resources. The remedy for such error in the penalty phase of a trial is a new trial on the penalty alone. <em>See, e.g., Turner v. Murray, </em>476 U.S. 28, 37 (1986) (involving error of constitutional magnitude). Although there are significant differences in the penalty phase of a federal trial and the sentencing hearing in our state courts, the logic of whether to grant a new trial when the error deals with the sentence applies equally to both proceedings. For these reasons, we hold that, under the circumstances of this case, requiring appellant to move for a mistrial or the giving of a cautionary instruction is not required in order to preserve her appeal. To so hold would be to raise form over substance. Accordingly, we hold that appellant\u2019s contemporaneous objection was sufficient to preserve her assignment of error for appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>II.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-5\">On the merits, appellant argues that the challenged statement was improper because (1) the consideration of appellant\u2019s refusal to accept a plea offer infringed her constitutional right to trial; (2) the prosecutor injected his own opinion as to the fairness of the offer; and (3) the prosecutor argued facts not in evidence. After reviewing the record, we conclude both that the prosecutor\u2019s comments were improper and that the trial judge failed to recognize this fact. When the prosecutor mentioned during closing arguments that appellant had been offered a ten-year sentence in exchange for a guilty plea, appellant objected. The trial judge told the prosecutor to \u201c[cjontinue the argument.\u201d The Commonwealth\u2019s Attorney then repeated his statement about the plea offer and said that appellant actually laughed and then \u201ctaunted [him] . . . about [his] ridiculous offer.\u201d When counsel for appellant objected again, the court said: \u201cThis is the argument stage, Mr. Hershner. You may argue what you want when Mr. Barry gets through. Go ahead, Mr. Barry.\u201d The General Assembly has made clear its concern over the sentencing judge\u2019s knowledge of rejected plea agreements. Under Code \u00a7 19.2-153, if a circuit court judge \u201chas rejected a plea bargain agreement submitted by both parties and the parties do not agree that he may hear the case,\u201d another judge must be appointed pursuant to the procedure outlined elsewhere in the Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-6\">The Commonwealth asserts that these comments were harmless, especially since they were made before the trial judge, who, unlike a jury, \u201cis uniquely capable because of his training, experience and judicial discipline to disregard potentially prejudicial argument during the mental process of adjudication.\u201d <em>Williams </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>234 Va. 168, 182, 360 S.E.2d 361, 369 (1987), <em>cert. denied, </em>484 U.S. 1020 (1988). In addition, the Commonwealth argues that the trial judge did not mention the rejected plea agreement as a factor he considered in pronouncing sentence. We conclude, however, based on the record, that the trial judge clearly failed to recognize the impropriety of these remarks because he twice failed to sustain appellant\u2019s objections thereto.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-7\">This case is clearly distinguishable from our recent holding in <em>Cole v. Commonwealth, </em>16 Va. App. 113, 115, 428 S.E.2d 303, 305 (1993), in which the challenged evidence concerning a prior conviction was admissible as it pertained to credibility. In <em>Cole, </em>there was no evidence that the trial judge considered the challenged evidence for any reason other than its proper purpose. <em>Id. </em>at 113, 428 S.E.2d at 305. We <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>emphasized, however, that <em>Cole </em>did not hold that \u201cthe admission of improper evidence in a bench trial [could] never result in reversible error.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 413, 428 S.E.2d at 305. The facts in this case present just such an example. Here, the challenged information could not properly have been introduced into evidence for <em>any </em>purpose and should not have been included in the prosecutor\u2019s argument. Therefore, we must presume, based on the trial judge\u2019s failure to sustain appellant\u2019s objection, that the information concerning the rejected plea agreement was considered for an improper purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-5\">We do not address whether the sentence recommended by the jury was appropriate. However, because we cannot conclude that the prosecutor\u2019s comments were harmless, we remand this case for resentencing by another judge pursuant to Code \u00a7 19.2-154.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-6\">\n<em>Remanded for resentencing.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b449-7\">Benton, X, and Cole, X, concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
