Scott (claimant) appeals from a decision of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Commission denying him compensation benefits. He contends that the commission erred in finding that his change of condition application was time barred by the provisions of Code \u00a7 65.1-99.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> He argues that the commission erred in limiting the tolling provisions of Code \u00a7 65.1-55.1 to those workers who <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"817\">*817</page-number>are \u201cprovided work\u201d only by their pre-injury employers. Finding no error, we affirm the decision of the commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-5\">Claimant sustained a compensable back injury on August 19, 1987, while working as a self-employed carpenter. His claim was accepted and compensation was paid for temporary total disability through March 23, 1988. Claimant returned to work on March 24, 1988 for a new employer, Stonewall Estates. His wages in this job exceeded his pre-injury wage. He continued to work for his new employer until January, 1991, when he again became disabled due to an aggravation of his earlier injury. On September 25, 1991, claimant filed a change in condition application seeking additional lost wage benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-6\">At the time of the original injury, the limitation period for making additional claims for disability benefits based on a change in condition was twenty-four months. During this twenty-four month limitation period, Code \u00a7 65.1-55.1 was enacted. That Code section, which became effective July 1, 1989, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A-MN\">All wages paid for a period not exceeding twenty-four consecutive months, to an employee (i) who is physically unable to return to his pre-injury work due to a compensable injury and (ii) who is <em>provided work </em>within his capacity at a wage equal to or greater than his pre-injury wage shall, for the sole purposes of \u00a7 65.1-99, be considered compensation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b859-9\"><em>Id. </em>(emphasis added).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b859-10\">On March 26, 1992, the deputy commissioner denied claimant\u2019s application for benefits as being time barred. The full commission affirmed and found that the limitations period of Code \u00a7 65.1-99 was not tolled in this case by Code \u00a7 65.1-55.1, because claimant\u2019s work was not \u201cprovided by his pre-injury employer,\u201d but rather, was obtained by him on his own initiative. The commission noted that the legislature could have used the word \u201cemployed,\u201d rather than \u201cprovided work,\u201d had that been the intended effect of the statute. The commission recognized that self-employed persons may have an impossible <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"818\">*818</page-number>burden of proof given the language of Code \u00a7 65.1-55.1 (now Code \u00a7 65.2-7080.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-6\">The sole issue to be decided in this case is whether the term \u201cprovided work\u201d as used in Code \u00a7 65.1-55.1 extends the limitation period for a change in condition application for work provided to a claimant by any source or only work provided by the pre-injury employer. Claimant concedes that his post-injury work was not provided by his former employer, and that it was a new and separate source of employment. In fact, during the three and one-half year period following his last receipt of benefits for the August 1987 compensable injury, he injured himself at his new employment and filed a claim against his new employer, Stonewall Estates.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b860-7\">Code \u00a7 65.1-55.1 ... operates solely to extend the limitation period of Code \u00a7 65.1-99 in cases where a claimant, who is physically unable to return to his pre-injury employment because of a compensable injury, returns to work within his capacity at a wage equal to or greater than his pre-injury wage. Thus, the language of Code \u00a7 65.1-55.1 has the same effect as if it had been added to Code \u00a7 65.1-99, namely allowing this certain class of claimants to receive an extension of the twenty-four and thirty-six months limitation periods provided in that section. Further, Code \u00a7 65.1-55.1 has no applicability, except with reference to Code \u00a7 65.1-99.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b860-8\"><em>Cohen </em>v. <em>Fairfax Hospital Ass\u2019n, </em>12 Va. App. 702, 707, 407 S.E.2d 329, 332 (1991). The limitation period prescribed by Code \u00a7 65.1-99 is premised upon the payment of compensation pursuant to a prior award under the Act. Such compensation is solely the responsibility of the pre-injury employer. No rational basis exists to construe payments by an unrelated employer as compensation under Code \u00a7 65.1-99. To hold that payments by another unrelated employer constitute compensation under Code \u00a7 65.1-55.1 would conflict with the plain meaning of compensation set forth in Code \u00a7 65.1-99.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-9\">In determining the meaning of a statute, a court may only look to the words of a statute if the statute is clear and unambiguous. <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Lukhard, 229 </em>Va. 316, 321, 330 S.E.2d 84, 87 (1985). \u201cAn ambiguity exists when the language is difficult to comprehend, is of doubtful import, or lacks clearness and definiteness.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We find that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"819\">*819</page-number>the language \u201cprovided work\u201d as used in Code \u00a7 65.1-55.1 is unambiguous and applies only to work provided by the pre-injury employer. Had the legislature intended a different result, it could easily have used different language. \u201cProvided work\u201d connotes an element of control over the work by the pre-injury employer, and this is not the case if the work is performed for a new employer. <em>Cf. Richmond Newspapers, Inc. v. Gill, </em>224 Va. 92, 294 S.E.2d 840 (1982) (employer-employee relationship defined by control).</p>\n<p id=\"b861-5\">Claimant\u2019s contrary construction of the statute, which would apply the tolling provision of Code \u00a7 65.1-55.1 to any claimant \u201cfinding\u201d work, would be an impermissible expansion of the statute to cover situations not intended by the General Assembly. <em>See Bowden </em>v. <em>Newport News Shipbuilding, </em>11 Va. App. 683, 401 S.E.2d 884 (1991) (payments received by claimant pursuant to the Longshore and Harbor Workers\u2019 Compensation Act were not \u201ccompensation\u201d as contemplated by Code \u00a7 65.1-87.1). The wages that claimant received from his new employer compensated him for the services he rendered and were not part of any award or required compensation under the Virginia Workers\u2019 Compensation Act. These funds had no relation to claimant\u2019s August 1987 injury or the benefits arising therefrom that he received. Accordingly, the provisions of Code \u00a7 65.1-55.1 do not apply to this case for the purposes of tolling the statute of limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-6\">In addition, the conclusion that claimant was not \u201cprovided work\u201d is consistent with the legislative intent of Code \u00a7 65.1-55.1. That statute was designed to prevent possible abuse by employers of the two-year limitation period set forth in Code \u00a7 65.1-99. <em>Greene v. Gwaltney of Smithfield, Inc., </em>13 Va. App. 486, 492, 413 S.E.2d 650, 654 (1992). The General Assembly enacted Code \u00a7 65.1-55.1 to prevent employers from lulling partially disabled workers into a false sense of security during this two-year period by providing employees light duty work at their pre-injury wage for two years and then terminating the employee without liability for future disability benefits. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b861-7\">As the commission properly held, this statute has no application to situations where the pre-injury employer does not \u201cprovide work\u201d to the employee. \u201c[A] statute should, if possible, be given a reasonable construction which will effect rather than defeat a legislative purpose evident from the history of the legislation.\u201d <em>Ambrogi v. Koontz, </em>224 Va. 381, 389, 297 S.E.2d 660, 664 (1982) (citing <em>American Airlines, Inc. v. Battle, </em>181 Va. 1, 8-11, 23 S.E.2d 796, 800-01 (1943)). When a claimant is hired by another employer, there is no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"820\">*820</page-number>need to protect him from the potential abuse of the statute of limitations by a pre-injury employer. Accordingly, we affirm the decision of the commission and dismiss the application.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-5\">\n<em>Affirmed and dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b862-6\">Koontz, J.,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> and Elder, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b858-12\"> Code \u00a7 65.1-99 was the general limitation statute for change in condition applications in effect on August 15, 1987, the date claimant suffered a compensable injury to his back. That section provided in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b858-13\">No such review shall be made after twenty-four months from the last day for which compensation was paid, pursuant to an award under this act, except thirty-six months from the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"817\">*817</page-number>last day for which compensation was paid shall be allowed for the filing of claims payable under \u00a7 65.1-56.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b859-12\">Code \u00a7 65.1-99 was recodified effective July 1, 1991, as Code \u00a7 65.2-708.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b859-13\"> Recodified as Code \u00a7 65.2-708(C).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b862-7\"> When the case was argued, Judge Koontz presided.
