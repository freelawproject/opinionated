Appellant contends that the trial court erred by (1) admitting into evidence certain statements he made; (2) admitting a \u201cshank\u201d and mask into evidence; (3) admitting into evidence a note he alleges was not authenticated; (4) allowing the Commonwealth to present testimony to the jury he alleges to be false and to impeach its own witness; and (5) denying his motions to strike and set aside the verdict as the evidence was insufficient to support a conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b957-7\">The jury\u2019s verdict will not be disturbed on appeal unless plainly wrong or without evidence to support it. <em>Traverso </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>6 Va. App. 172, 176, 366 S.E.2d 719, 721 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b957-8\">Upon familiar principles, we view the evidence in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, granting to it all reasonable inferences fairly deducible therefrom. <em>Id. </em>As the parties are fully conversant with the record in this case, we will recite only those facts necessary to a disposition of the issues on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b957-9\">The record discloses that on June 6, 1991, appellant, an inmate of Youth Center One at the Lorton Reformatory, stated to Corrections Officer Joan Courtney that he was \u201cback [at Lorton] on another charge\u201d and \u201cif [he] g[o]t some time,\u201d he was \u201ctaking somebody off the count.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b957-10\">Approximately one week later, on June 15, 1991 at 9:40 p.m., Corrections Officer Glenwood Greene observed inmate Daniel Childs (victim) run from the \u201cTV room\u201d in \u201ctwo dorm,\u201d stating that he had been stabbed. Greene saw a masked man wearing \u201cinstitution clothes\u201d poised at the threshold of a doorway leading outside to the porch. As the masked individual ran toward the porch, Greene ran out a second door to \u201ccut him off.\u201d However, the masked man \u201cdoubled back\u201d through the building, so Greene also \u201cdoubled back\u201d through the door he had just exited. Greene then saw an unmasked individual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"916\">*916</page-number>running out of the building and gave pursuit. Greene did not see the individual\u2019s face and \u201clost him\u201d in \u201cfour dorm.\u201d Greene returned to \u201ctwo dorm,\u201d where he retrieved a \u201cshank\u201d and mask from the porch, approximately five feet from where he had observed \u201cthe man with the mask.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b958-5\">Anthony Burnell, a \u201crecreation specialist\u201d at Lorton, testified that, at approximately 9:40 p.m. that same evening, he observed Greene chasing appellant. He \u201ccalled out to Officer Greene and told him that it was Ragland who he was chasing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b958-6\">At approximately 10:00 p.m., Corrections Officers Eugene Chesson and John Lee \u201cwent to four dorm to pick up [appellant] to bring him to Control Center.\u201d Neither officer mentioned the stabbing or informed appellant \u201cwhy he was going to Control.\u201d As appellant was entering die Control Center, Burnell overheard a \u201ccouple of inmates\u201d ask him, \u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d Appellant responded, \u201cThey think that I had something to do with the stabbing in two dorm.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b958-7\">On October 30, 1991, immediately prior to trial, the Commonwealth advised the trial court that a witness, inmate Nathaniel Boone, had \u201cidentified [appellant] as the man he saw come into the TV room with a mask on, stab the victim, take the mask off and run out.\u201d The Commonwealth indicated that Boone was unwilling to testify and moved the court to \u201ccall him to the stand and to hold him in contempt\u201d for such refusal. The trial court called Boone, who admitted that he witnessed the murder and heard the assailant referred to as \u201cTy \u2014 Ty \u2014 something like that.\u201d Upon further examination, he admitted that he had previously given appellant\u2019s full name. He testified that his previous account of the events had been truthful, but nevertheless stated, \u201cI\u2019m not testifying. My life on the line; not you all\u2019s.\u201d He was found in contempt and sentenced to jail. Shortly thereafter, however, he indicated that he was willing to testify and the trial commenced.</p>\n<p id=\"b958-8\">On October 31, 1991, the second day of trial, Boone\u2019s attorney informed the court that Boone would testify that he \u201cmade up\u201d his previous statements and \u201cdid not actually see anything.\u201d The Commonwealth called Boone to the stand over appellant\u2019s objection, stating, \u201cWe don\u2019t know if he\u2019s going to give that new version anymore than we were sure he was going to give the old version. So, I guess at this point we simply have to call him to the stand and see what he says under oath.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b959-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"917\">*917</page-number>Boone testified that he \u201cdidn\u2019t see anyone stab nobody.\u201d The Commonwealth then inquired whether he had \u201cin the past given a different version of the events that evening.\u201d Appellant objected, contending that the Commonwealth was \u201cimpeaching [its] own witness.\u201d The trial court overruled the objection, and Boone explained that he had lied in his previous statement. He stated that he had only identified appellant as the assailant because he had been \u201ctricked\u201d by investigators.</p>\n<p id=\"b959-5\">Emmett Anderson, an inmate at the Fairfax Adult Detention Center, testified that, on the morning of October 31, 1991, appellant threw a note<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> into his cell and asked him \u2018 \u2018to try to get it delivered to a guy around the corner in cell 38.\u201d Anderson passed the note to inmate Jeffrey Hunter, who testified that he was \u201csupposed to pass it to a fellow in cell R38,\u201d but was apprehended by deputies who \u201ctook the note\u201d from him.</p>\n<p id=\"b959-6\">Deputy David Heflin testified that Paul Vernon was the sole occupant of cell R38. Vernon testified for appellant and stated that he saw the assailant\u2019s face and it was not appellant. However, Investigator James Dooley testified that, shortly after the murder, Vernon told him that he \u201cdid not see anything.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b959-7\">Frances Field, an Assistant Chief Medical Examiner, testified at trial that the shank found at the scene had \u201cdimensions which would be consistent with the [victim\u2019s] wound.\u201d Scientific analysis detected human blood on the shank.</p>\n<p id=\"b959-8\">Appellant first argues that the trial court erred by admitting into evidence his statement to Courtney that he was \u201ctaking somebody off the count,\u201d and his statement to other inmates, overheard by Burnell, that \u201c[t]hey think that I had something to do with the stabbing in two <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"918\">*918</page-number>dorm.\u201d Appellant contends that the statements are irrelevant, highly prejudicial and inadmissible hearsay.</p>\n<p id=\"b960-5\">Evidence is relevant if it has any logical tendency, however slight, to establish a fact at issue in the case. <em>Jenkins v. Winchester Dep\u2019t of Social Servs., </em>12 Va. App. 1178, 1186, 409 S.E.2d 16, 21 (1991); <em>Wise v. Commonwealth, </em>6 Va. App. 178, 187, 367 S.E.2d 197, 202-03 (1988). \u201cUpon finding that certain evidence is relevant, the trial court is then required to employ a balancing test to determine whether the prejudicial effect of the evidence sought to be admitted is greater than its probative value.\u201d <em>Wise, </em>6 Va. App. at 188, 367 S.E.2d at 203. \u201cThis responsibility is a matter submitted to the sound discretion of the trial court, [which] will not be disturbed on appeal absent a clear abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b960-6\">The statement overheard by Burnell was relevant to the issue of whether appellant stabbed the victim. Appellant had knowledge of a stabbing that took place in a dorm other than his own within twenty minutes of its occurrence, although the corrections officers had not mentioned it in his presence. The statement to Courtney was relevant to appellant\u2019s intent to kill. Intent \u201c \u2018may be, and frequently is, shown by circumstances.\u2019 These circumstances include a person\u2019s statements.\u201d <em>Campbell </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>12 Va. App. 476, 483-84, 405 S.E.2d 1, 4 (1991) (en banc) (citation omitted). Further, the fact that the statement to Courtney was made over one week prior to the stabbing goes to the weight of the evidence, not its admissibility. <em>Wise, 6 </em>Va. App. at 188, 367 S.E.2d at 203; <em>see also Duncan </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>2 Va. App. 717, 723-25, 347 S.E.2d 539, 543-44 (1986). We find no abuse of discretion in the trial court\u2019s determination that the probative value of the statements exceeded any prejudicial effect that may have resulted from their admission.</p>\n<p id=\"b960-7\">Neither are the statements inadmissible hearsay. \u201cAny statement by a party to the proceedings, including an out-of-court statement by a defendant in a criminal case, is admissible as an exception to the hearsay rule when offered against that party.\u201d <em>Alatishe v. Commonwealth, </em>12 Va. App. 376, 378, 404 S.E.2d 81, 82 (1991); <em>West </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>12 Va. App. 906, 910, 407 S.E.2d 22, 24 (1991). The statement is not required to have been inculpatory or incriminating at the time it was made. <em>Alatishe, </em>12 Va. App. at 378, 404 S.E.2d at 82. Appellant\u2019s statements were party admissions and, thus, admissible as an exception to the hearsay rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b961-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"919\">*919</page-number>Appellant further contends that the trial court erred by admitting into evidence the shank and mask recovered by Officer Greene. The admissibility of evidence is within the broad discretion of the trial court, which will not be disturbed on appeal absent an abuse of discretion. <em>Blain v. Commonwealth, </em>7 Va. App. 10, 16, 371 S.E.2d 838, 842 (1988). Here, immediately after the stabbing, Greene observed a masked individual standing in the doorway of the room where the incident took place. Greene later retrieved a shank and mask approximately \u201cfive feet\u201d from where he observed this individual. Human blood was detected on the shank. The medical examiner testified that the shank had \u201cdimensions which would be consistent with the [victim\u2019s] wound.\u201d We find no abuse of discretion by the trial court\u2019s admission of these items into evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b961-5\">Appellant next argues that the trial court erred by admitting the note into evidence without proper authentication. Before any writing may be introduced into evidence, it must be authenticated, \u201cwhich is the providing of an evidentiary basis sufficient for the trier of fact to conclude that the writing came from the source claimed.\u201d <em>Walters </em>v. <em>Littleton, </em>223 Va. 446, 451, 290 S.E.2d 839, 842 (1982). A document\u2019s authenticity may be established through the use of circumstantial evidence, where surrounding circumstances establish that the writing is genuine. Id.; <em>Kitze </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>15 Va. App. 254, 263, 422 S.E.2d 601, 607 (1992); <em>Jackson v. Commonwealth, </em>13 Va. App. 599, 602 n.1, 413 S.E.2d 662, 665 n.1 (1992); <em>Duncan, </em>2 Va. App. at 726, 347 S.E.2d at 544. \u201c \u2018The court must determine if the circumstantial evidence is sufficient to justify the document\u2019s admission; the jury will then, as in all cases, make an independent decision as to whether the document is genuine.\u2019 \u201d <em>Duncan, </em>2 Va. App. at 726-27, 347 S.E.2d at 544 (citation omitted); <em>Kitze, </em>15 Va. App. at 263, 422 S.E.2d at 607. \u201cThe amount of evidence sufficient to establish authenticity will vary according to the type of writing, and the circumstances attending its admission, but generally proof of any circumstances which will support a finding that the writing is genuine will suffice.\u201d <em>Walters, </em>223 Va. at 451, 290 S.E.2d at 842.</p>\n<p id=\"b961-6\">Here, the evidence established that appellant threw the note into another inmate\u2019s cell and asked the inmate \u201cto get it delivered\u201d to Vernon, who was one of appellant\u2019s witnesses. The inmate identified the note as the one he had received and identified appellant as \u201cthe person that threw the note.\u201d Further, the contents of the note were \u201cfairly unique\u201d to the offense for which appellant was being tried. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"920\">*920</page-number><em>See Duncan, 2 </em>Va. App. at 727, 347 S.E.2d at 545. We find the evidence sufficient to support the trial court\u2019s decision to admit the note.</p>\n<p id=\"b962-5\">Appellant further contends, however, that the note was improperly admitted for impeachment purposes \u201cbefore the issue had been generated\u201d by appellant. We disagree. Evidence that a defendant \u201cprocured, or attempted to procure, the absence of a witness, or to bribe or suppress testimony against him, is admissible, as it tends to show the unrighteousness of the defendant\u2019s cause and a consciousness of guilt.\u201d <em>McMillan v. Commonwealth, </em>188 Va. 429, 432-33, 50 S.E.2d 428, 430 (1948).</p>\n<p id=\"b962-6\">We turn next to appellant\u2019s argument that the trial court erred by allowing the Commonwealth to present false testimony to the jury. It is well settled that the Commonwealth may not knowingly use false testimony. <em>Verlander v. Commonwealth, </em>5 Va. App. 482, 485, 364 S.E.2d 531, 532,(1988); <em>Walker v. Commonwealth, </em>4 Va. App. 286, 301, 356 S.E.2d 853, 861 (1987); <em>see also Dozier v. Commonwealth, </em>219 Va. 1113, 1116, 253 S.E.2d 655, 657 (1979). The record here supports the Commonwealth\u2019s representation to the court that it did not know what Boone\u2019s testimony would be.</p>\n<p id=\"b962-7\">Prior to trial, Boone stated under oath that, although his previous statements to investigators had been \u201cthe truth,\u201d he would not testify at trial. Shortly thereafter, however, he indicated that he was willing to testify. On the second day of trial, Boone\u2019s counsel informed the court that Boone would testify that his previous statements had been \u201cmade up.\u201d In response, the Commonwealth\u2019s Attorney stated: \u201cWe don\u2019t know if he\u2019s going to give that new version anymore than we were sure he was going to give the old version. So, I guess at this point we simply have to call him to the stand and see what he says under oath.\u201d We cannot say as a matter of law that the representations of the prosecutor, as an oificer of the court, were false. Thus, we find that the trial court did not err in allowing Boone to testify.</p>\n<p id=\"b962-8\">Appellant further contends that the trial court erred by allowing the Commonwealth to impeach Boone through the use of his prior inconsistent statements. Code \u00a7 8.01-403, applicable in criminal as well as civil cases, allows impeachment of a party\u2019s witness with prior inconsistent statements after that witness has been found by the trial court to be adverse. <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>6 Va. App. 82, 85, 366 S.E.2d 716, 718 (1988). \u201cIn order to impeach one\u2019s own witness, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"921\">*921</page-number>however, it is not sufficient merely that the witness gave a contradictory statement on a prior occasion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Rather, the \u201ctestimony offered must be injurious or damaging to the case of the party who called the witness.\u201d <em>Id. </em>If the testimony \u201cis of a negative character and has no probative value, there is no statutory basis for impeachment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 85-86, 366 S.E.2d at 718; <em>see also Virginia Elec. &amp; Power Co. </em>v. <em>Hall, </em>184 Va. 102, 106, 34 S.E.2d 382, 383 (1945).</p>\n<p id=\"b963-5\">In <em>Brown, </em>a witness testified that he \u201chad not seen the stabbing\u201d for which Brown was on trial, in direct contradiction to his earlier statement to investigators that he had witnessed the incident. We held that this testimony lacked probative value and was not \u201cdamaging or injurious to the Commonwealth\u2019s case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 86, 366 S.E.2d at 719. Because it \u201ccould not have assisted the trier of fact in determining [the defendant\u2019s] guilt or innocence,\u201d it was, thus, not subject to impeachment. <em>Id. </em>Similarly, Boone\u2019s testimony that he \u201cdidn\u2019t see anyone stab nobody\u201d was neither damaging nor injurious to the Commonwealth\u2019s case; thus, it was not subject to impeachment by the Commonwealth.</p>\n<p id=\"b963-6\">Having found that the trial court erred in permitting the Commonwealth to impeach Boone\u2019s testimony, we nevertheless hold that, under the facts of this case, the error was harmless. \u201cThe crux of the harmless error analysis is whether the defendant received a fair trial on the merits and substantial justice has been achieved.\u201d <em>Timmons v. Commonwealth, </em>15 Va. App. 196, 199, 421 S.E.2d 894, 896 (1992). A non-constitutional error is harmless if \u201c \u2018it plainly appears from the record and the evidence given at the trial that\u2019 the error did not affect the verdict.\u201d <em>Lavinder </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>12 Va. App. 1003, 1005, 407 S.E.2d 910, 911 (1991) (en banc) (citation omitted). \u2018 \u2018An error does not affect a verdict if a reviewing court can conclude, without usurping the jury\u2019s fact finding function, that, had the error not occurred, the verdict would have been the same.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In this instance, the remaining evidence against appellant was substantial. Based upon our review of the record and the evidence, we conclude that the Commonwealth\u2019s impeachment of Boone did not affect the verdict or otherwise deprive appellant of a fair trial on the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b963-8\">Lastly, we find that the trial court did not err in denying appellant\u2019s motions to strike and to set aside the verdict. The evidence was sufficient to support his conviction. The Commonwealth established that, one week before the murder, appellant stated that he was \u201ctaking somebody off the count.\u201d Immediately following the stabbing, Officer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"922\">*922</page-number>Greene observed a masked man at the scene and gave pursuit. The fleeing man, who had since discarded the mask, ran by Burnell, with Greene in pursuit. Burnell identified the man as appellant. Greene subsequently recovered a mask and shank from the scene; the shank bore traces of human blood and its dimensions were consistent with the victim\u2019s wound. Appellant displayed knowledge of the stabbing, which took place in a dorm other than his own, within twenty minutes of its occurrence, although corrections officers had not mentioned it in his presence. Finally, appellant attempted to communicate, with one of his witnesses by passing a note to him through other prisoners. From this evidence, the jury could have inferred beyond a reasonable doubt that appellant stabbed the victim. We cannot say that its judgment is plainly wrong or without evidence to support it.</p>\n<p id=\"b964-5\">Appellant additionally argues that his motion to set aside the verdict should have been granted because of the \u201ctotality\u201d of the \u201csubstantial errors committed during the trial.\u201d We have reviewed the record and conclude that appellant was not denied a fair trial based upon trial court error.</p>\n<p id=\"b964-6\">For the reasons stated, the judgment of the trial court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b964-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b964-8\">Bray, J., and Fitzpatrick, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b957-11\"> The \u201ccount\u201d is the roster of residents at Lorton.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b959-9\"> The note read as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b959-10\">Look</p>\n<p id=\"b959-11\">After Dannyboy got stabbed he ran out the front door. You didn\u2019t see Boone in there. About 9 or 10 people in the T.V. room about 6 to 7 had on institution clothes about 4 fit the mask man description. In the whole Dorm it was about 10 people who fit that description. Say cause when you and niggas in the dorm play B.B. you wasn\u2019t the tallest at all.

You had institution clothes on that night. They didn\u2019t count until Green came back about 20 to 25 min. later. And then other people were coming from the gym and off the pound.
