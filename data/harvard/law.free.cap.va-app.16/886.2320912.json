Weller received three life sentences for capital murder, robbery, and arson; he was sentenced to two and four years, respectively, for the firearm convictions. He contends that the trial court erred in: (1) excluding testimony that would have shown that someone else committed these crimes; (2) refusing to permit the defense to call James Miles as an adverse witness; (3) admitting the victim\u2019s statements to her sister the night before her death; and (4) excluding testimony regarding the description of a ring Weller offered to sell three weeks before the murder. Finding no reversible error, we affirm Weller\u2019s convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b930-9\">Because Weller does not challenge the sufficiency of the evidence, we restate only those facts necessary to explain our holding. Thelma Baker was eighty-five years old when she was murdered in the early morning hours of March 21, 1989. The cause of death was \u201csmoke inhalation after receiving multiple gunshot wounds.\u201d Baker\u2019s body was found incinerated in a fire at her home at 942 Oaklette Drive in the City of Chesapeake. She had been shot in her left arm, in the back of her head, and in her neck.</p>\n<p id=\"b930-10\">Weller, who had worked for Baker as a handyman for many years, was arrested on April 2, 1989. The police discovered a .22-caliber revolver and five rings in Weller\u2019s backpack. Those rings, which were identified at trial as belonging to Baker, were described as a diamond engagement ring, a wedding band, an Eastern Star ring, a turquoise ring and a large white gold diamond ring.</p>\n<p id=\"b931-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"889\">*889</page-number>Three .22-caliber bullets were recovered from Baker\u2019s body. The bullets were deformed, as a result of impacting something hard. However, the rifling characteristics of one bullet were consistent with those of the .22-caliber revolver found in Weller\u2019s possession at the time of his arrest. While incarcerated, Weller told a fellow inmate that he had shot Baker and burned down her house because he was interested in her jewelry.</p>\n<p id=\"b931-5\">A key issue at trial was whether Baker had the five rings, which were found in Weller\u2019s backpack, at the time of her death.</p>\n<p id=\"b931-6\">The day before her death, Baker told her sister, Arron Cannon, during a telephone conversation, that she was going to give her two rings \u2014 her engagement and wedding rings \u2014 to take to a jeweler to be repaired. Anne Swancey, another sister, testified that Baker always wore her engagement and wedding rings. Baker\u2019s hairdresser, Inez Johnson, testified that Baker was wearing her wedding ring, her engagement ring, a turquoise ring and an Eastern Star ring two or three days before she was murdered.</p>\n<p id=\"b931-7\">Approximately three weeks before the murder, Weller offered to sell a ring to Pamela Baker. Although Pamela Baker was permitted to testify that Weller had offered to sell her a ring, the trial court did not permit Pamela Baker to testify that Weller described the ring as \u201cantiquish looking . . . with a large green stone.\u201d On March 22, 1989, the day after Baker\u2019s murder, Weller entered an Appomattox jewelry store and requested an appraisal of a large white gold diamond ring, which was identified as Baker\u2019s ring. Weller told the jeweler he had found it outside a business with a metal detector. On that day, Weller telephoned a friend, Thomas Mussick, and told him he had found a ring using a metal detector.</p>\n<p id=\"b931-8\">At trial, the defense attempted to show that two other men, Kenny Dunbar and James Miles, committed the crimes for which Weller was charged. Weller proffered that the testimony of Charlene Dunbar and Elizabeth Lamore would place the men at the scene of the crime with a .22-caliber weapon and would establish motive. The trial court excluded a substantial portion of the proffered testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b931-9\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b931-10\">Weller contends that the trial court erred in excluding the testimony of Charlene Dunbar and Elizabeth Lamore. He contends that this testimony was relevant and tended to show that Kenny Dunbar and/or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"890\">*890</page-number>James Miles committed or may have committed the crimes for which he was charged. The Commonwealth contends that this evidence was largely inadmissible hearsay and irrelevant.</p>\n<p id=\"b932-5\">\u201cIn Virginia, evidence that a crime was actually committed by someone other than the accused is admissible for the purpose of generating a reasonable doubt of the guilt of the accused.\u201d Charles E. Friend, <em>The Law of Evidence in Virginia </em>\u00a7 150 (3d ed. 1988). However, \u201c[t]he evidence introduced must point directly to guilt of a third party.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Thus, \u201cwhere there is a trend of facts and circumstances tending clearly to point out some other person as the guilty party, the [defendant] may introduce any legal evidence which is available tending to prove that another person committed the crime with which he is charged.\u201d <em>Karnes </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>125 Va. 758, 766, 99 S.E. 562, 565 (1919). The admissibility of circumstantial evidence tending to prove the guilt of a third person is left to the discretion of the trial court. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b932-6\">Although circumstantial evidence tending to prove the guilt of a third party is to be liberally received, <em>id., </em>the evidence must be legally admissible. That is, the evidence must be relevant and material, and may not be hearsay. Because the evidence in question was not legally admissible, we find no error in the trial court\u2019s ruling excluding this evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b932-7\">Weller proffered the testimony of Charlene Dunbar and Elizabeth Lamore. Based upon this proffer, the trial court refused to permit the witnesses to testily to the following: James Miles owned a .22-caliber gun; James Miles and Kenny Dunbar said they had seen the fire on Oaklette Drive; James Miles said he heard gunshots and screams from Baker\u2019s house and saw a man running from Baker\u2019s house, and reported this to the police three or four days after the fire; James Miles had lived in Baker\u2019s neighborhood fifteen years ago and he had said that he wanted to buy a house there; James Miles said he knew the lady who lived in the burning house was rich and elderly; and James Miles spent extravagantly after the incident. However, the trial court permitted Charlene Dunbar to testify that Kenny Dunbar owned a .22-caliber gun and that she saw this weapon in his vehicle when she, Kenny Dunbar, and James Miles went to watch the fire at Baker\u2019s home.</p>\n<p id=\"b932-8\">Hearsay is testimony consisting of \u201c \u2018a narration by one person of matters told him by another,\u2019 \u201d which is offered to prove the truth of its content. <em>Evans-Smith </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>5 Va. App. 188, 197, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"891\">*891</page-number>361 S.E.2d 436, 441 (1987) (quoting <em>Williams v. Morris, </em>200 Va. 413, 417, 105 S.E.2d 829, 832 (1958)). \u201cThe party seeking to have hearsay declarations \u2018admitted as an exception to the general rule must clearly show that they are within the exception.\u2019 \u201d <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>11 Va. App. 75, 88, 396 S.E.2d 844, 851 (1990) (quoting <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Thomas, </em>227 Va. 466, 472, 318 S.E.2d 382, 386 (1984)). The testimony relating what Kenny Dunbar and James Miles told the witnesses on the night of the crime is hearsay evidence. Weller points to no exception to the hearsay rule that would permit introduction of such testimony. Therefore, that testimony was properly excluded.</p>\n<p id=\"b933-5\">The remaining evidence, that James Miles owned a .22-caliber gun, spent extravagantly after the incident, had lived in Baker\u2019s neighborhood fifteen years ago, and reported his observations to the police several days after the crime is not relevant to any matter at issue. \u201cEvidence is relevant in the trial of a case if it has any tendency to establish a fact which is properly at issue.\u201d <em>Wise </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>6 Va. App. 178, 187, 367 S.E.2d 197, 202-03 (1988). The proffered evidence does not tend to prove the proposition for which it was offered \u2014 that Miles or Dunbar committed the crimes. There was no evidence tying Miles\u2019 weapon, spending habits, or prior residence in Baker\u2019s neighborhood to these crimes. The Commonwealth\u2019s expert excluded Miles\u2019 weapon as the murder weapon. Although defense counsel stated that Elizabeth Lamore would testify that Miles spent extravagantly after the murder, no connection was made between the crimes and Miles\u2019 spending habits. Furthermore, the fact that Miles used to live in Baker\u2019s neighborhood does not tend to show that he would murder her and bum down her house when he indicated that he wanted to <em>buy </em>a house in Baker\u2019s neighborhood. Even considering this evidence together, <em>see Wynn </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>5 Va. App. 283, 291, 362 S.E.2d 193, 198 (1987), it does not tend to show that Miles or Dunbar committed the crimes in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b933-6\">Therefore, because the excluded evidence constituted inadmissible hearsay and was irrelevant, we find that the trial court properly exercised its discretion in excluding the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b933-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b933-8\">Weller also contends that the trial court erred in refusing to permit him to call James Miles as an adverse witness for the defense. Weller claims that Miles was an adverse witness because he refused to talk to defense counsel and may have committed the crimes. When Weller <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"892\">*892</page-number>asked the court for leave to call Miles as an adverse witness, the court stated that it would not permit Weller to proceed against Miles as an adverse witness based solely on these grounds. The court indicated that Weller could call Miles to the stand and, if the witness proved to be adverse, the court would give defense counsel \u201cadditional latitude.\u201d However, Weller did not call Miles as a witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b934-5\">Code \u00a7 8.01-401(A), which applies in both criminal and civil actions, <em>Trout v. </em>Commonwealth, 167 Va. 511, 516, 188 S.E. 219, 221 (1936), provides that a party may call to the stand a witness \u201chaving an adverse interest\u201d and may examine the witness \u201caccording to the rules applicable to cross-examination.\u201d The Virginia Supreme Court has construed the term \u201chaving an adverse interest\u201d to include, first, a party to the litigation, and, second, a person, though not a party, who has a financial or other personal interest in the outcome. <em>Daniels </em>v. <em>Morris, </em>199 Va. 205, 211, 98 S.E.2d 694, 698 (1957); <em>Matthews v. Hicks, </em>197 Va. 112, 122, 87 S.E.2d 629, 635 (1955); <em>Butler </em>v. <em>Parrocha, </em>186 Va. 426, 431, 43 S.E.2d 1, 4 (1947). A nonparty witness does not have an \u201cadverse interest\u201d simply because his or her testimony is adverse to the calling party. <em>Daniels, </em>199 Va. at 211, 98 S.E.2d at 699. <em>See </em>Friend, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 22 (\u201cThe test is not whether the witness\u2019s testimony would <em>necessarily </em>be adverse, <em>but whether the witness has an adverse interest\u201d).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b934-6\">Additionally, the Virginia Supreme Court has held that Code \u00a7 8.01-401 also applies \u201cwhere the witness has no adverse interest, but is shown to be adverse or hostile to the party introducing him.\u201d <em>Nelson v. Commonwealth, </em>153 Va. 909, 919, 150 S.E. 407, 410 (1929).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b934-7\">Thus, even where the hostility of the witness has appeared for the first time while the witness is on the stand, through the witness\u2019s answers and demeanor during direct examination, the examining party may obtain leave to question the witness by cross-examination methods. The statute in question is merely declaratory of well-established Virginia practice.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b934-8\">Friend, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 22 (footnotes omitted). Application of this rule, however, is limited to instances when it is clear that the witness is <em>in fact </em>hostile or adverse at trial. <em>See Pendleton </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>131 Va. 676, 706, 109 S.E. 201, 211 (1921). The determination of whether a witness is \u201cunwilling or hostile\u201d is a matter that rests with the discretion of the trial court. 81 Am. Jur. 2d <em>Witnesses </em>\u00a7 808 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b935-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"893\">*893</page-number>We find no error in the trial court\u2019s ruling because Weller failed to prove that Miles had an \u201cadverse interest\u201d or was, in fact, adverse or hostile. Based upon the record before us, we cannot say that Miles had a financial or personal interest in the outcome of the trial so as to render him \u201cadverse\u201d within the meaning of Code \u00a7 8.01-401(A). Weller introduced no evidence showing that Miles had a financial interest in the outcome of the trial. Furthermore, the evidence Weller alleges tends to show that Miles may have committed the crimes does not warrant a finding that Miles had an \u201cadverse interest.\u201d The trial court was entitled to find that the evidence showing that Miles viewed the fire, had a gun in his truck, was familiar with Baker\u2019s neighborhood, and spent extravagantly after the incident did not demonstrate that Miles had a personal interest in the outcome of the trial. Additionally, because Miles never took the stand to testify at trial, Weller failed to establish that Miles was adverse or hostile <em>in fact. </em>Consequently, the trial court\u2019s refusal to declare Miles an adverse witness is not a basis for reversing Weller\u2019s convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b935-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b935-6\">Weller contends that the trial court erred in permitting Baker\u2019s sister, Arron Cannon, to testify about statements Baker made to her the night before her death. The testimony to which Weller objects is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b935-7\">A. I told Thelma I had had my ring fixed by the jeweler. And she shook her hand and her wedding ring \u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b935-8\">Q. And what did she say?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b935-9\">A. That hers was still \u2014 it shook whenever she \u2014 (demonstrating). . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b935-10\">A. She was going to give them to me to carry back up to Silver Spring when I was there going to Dr. George the next time that I came. And I would take it to the jeweler and he would fix it so it wouldn\u2019t \u2014 it wouldn\u2019t \u2014 mine doesn\u2019t, (demonstrating).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b935-11\">Q. Did she tell you which rings she wanted to take to the jewelers?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b935-12\">A. Yes, her wedding ring and her engagement ring.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b935-13\">Weller claims that this testimony was inadmissible hearsay evidence offered to prove that Baker had the rings on her hand the night <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"894\">*894</page-number>before her death.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> He further maintains that introduction of this testimony was prejudicial because the defense theory was that Weller had the rings in his possession prior to Baker\u2019s death. The Commonwealth, on the other hand, contends that the testimony was not subject to exclusion under the hearsay rule because it was not offered to prove the truth of its content; rather, it was admitted as circumstantial evidence tending to prove that Baker had the rings in her possession that night.</p>\n<p id=\"b936-5\">\u201c \u2018Hearsay is testimony which consists [of] a narration by one person of matters told him by another.\u2019 \u201d <em>Evans-Smith, </em>5 Va. App. at 197, 361 S.E.2d at 441 (citation omitted). However, \u201c \u2018[i]f the declaration is offered <em>solely to show that it was uttered, </em>without regard to the truth or falsity of its content, the declaration is not excluded by the hearsay rule.\u2019 \u201d <em>Speller v. Commonwealth, </em>2 Va. App. 437, 446, 345 S.E.2d 542, 548 (1986) (quoting Charles E. Friend, <em>The Law of Evidence in Virginia </em>\u00a7 225 (2d ed. 1983)). \u201cHowever, the mere incantation that hearsay evidence is admitted to prove a proposition other than the truth of the assertion does not cure the hearsay problem. The proposition to be proved must be relevant to the issues at trial.\u201d <em>Estes </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>8 Va. App. 520, 523, 382 S.E.2d 491, 492 (1989). In addition, the probative value of the evidence must outweigh any unfair prejudicial effect. Friend, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 225 (3d ed. 1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b936-6\">Consistent with these principles, the Supreme Court of Virginia has ruled that an out-of-court declaration is admissible \u2018 \u2018when the declaration is not offered to prove the literal truth of the statement, but the statement\u2019s content is used as circumstantial evidence that a certain event occurred.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Church v. Commonwealth, </em>230 Va. 208, 335 S.E.2d 823 (1985)). In <em>Church, </em>the Court held that a child\u2019s statement that sex is \u201cdirty, nasty and it hurt\u201d was \u201cadmissible as circumstantial evidence tending to establish the probability of a fact in issue,\u201d that the child had been sexually assaulted. 230 Va. at 212, 335 S.E.2d at 825-26.</p>\n<p id=\"b936-7\">Here, the trial court, relying on the holding in <em>Church, </em>ruled that Cannon\u2019s testimony was admissible as circumstantial evidence tending to prove that Baker had her wedding and engagement rings in her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"895\">*895</page-number>possession the night she made the statement. We agree. This evidence was not offered for the truth of its content \u2014 that Baker wanted to get her rings fixed by a jeweler in Silver Spring. Baker\u2019s statement the night before her death that she wanted to get her rings fixed was circumstantial evidence that she possessed the rings that night. Thus, the evidence tended to prove a fact properly at issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b937-5\">Because this evidence was admissible for the purpose of proving that Baker had possession of these rings at the time of her death, the fact that this evidence might be inadmissible if offered for some other purpose is of no consequence. Evidence is not subject to exclusion simply because the evidence is inadmissible if offered for some other purpose, unless such admission would result in \u201cextreme prejudice.\u201d Friend, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 225. \u201c[I]t is a time-honored principle of evidence law that, in general, if evidence is admissible for <em>any </em>purpose, it is admissible.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Although introduction of this testimony was arguably damaging to Weller\u2019s theory of the case, it did not result in such \u2018 \u2018extreme prejudice\u201d as to warrant exclusion. This evidence was not the only evidence tending to prove, circumstantially, that Baker possessed her rings at the time of her death. Inez Johnson\u2019s testimony that Baker possessed the rings three days prior to Baker\u2019s death contradicted Weller\u2019s assertion that he possessed one of them three weeks prior to Baker\u2019s death. It was for the jury to resolve that conflict in the evidence. Accordingly, we hold that the trial court did not err in admitting this testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b937-6\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b937-7\">Weller also assigns error to the trial court\u2019s exclusion of testimony by Pamela Baker. Pamela Baker was permitted to testify that three weeks prior to the murder Weller told her \u201c[h]e was interested in selling an object to me, a ring.\u201d However, the trial court did not permit Pamela Baker to relate what Weller said regarding the description of the ring. Based upon defense counsel\u2019s proffer, Pamela Baker would have testified that \u201c[i]t was antiquish looking, is the way he described it, with a large green stone.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b937-8\">This testimony was not offered to prove that Weller was willing to sell an antique ring with a green stone. Rather, the evidence was offered as circumstantial proof of the fact that Weller possessed the described ring prior to Baker\u2019s death. Weller\u2019s offer to sell the ring is consistent with his possession of the ring. When introduced for this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"896\">*896</page-number>purpose, this testimony tends to prove a fact at issue. Because the testimony was offered as circumstantial proof of a fact properly at issue, and was not offered to prove the truth of its content, the trial court erred in excluding this evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b938-5\">However, an erroneous evidentiary ruling does not require reversal of a criminal conviction where the error is \u201charmless.\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b938-6\">A criminal conviction shall not be reversed for an error committed at trial when \u201cit plainly appears from the record and the evidence given at the trial that the parties have had a fair trial on the merits and substantial justice has been reached.\u201d Trial error is presumed to be prejudicial and \u201ca fair trial on the merits and substantial justice are not achieved if an error at trial has affected the verdict.\u201d We must reverse a criminal conviction \u201cunless \u2018it plainly appears from the record and the evidence given at the trial that\u2019 the error did not affect the verdict.\u201d An error does not affect the verdict if we can determine, \u201cwithout usurping the jury\u2019s fact finding function, that, had the error not occurred, the verdict would have been the same.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b938-7\"><em>Hanson v. Commonwealth, </em>14 Va. App. 173, 189-90, 416 S.E.2d 14, 24 (1992) (citations omitted). We conclude that the error in excluding a description of the ring was harmless because it did not affect the verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b938-8\">The evidence showed that Baker had four of her rings in her possession shortly before her death and that Weller had all of Baker\u2019s rings after her death. No evidence established that Weller had possession of all of Baker\u2019s rings prior to her death. Thus, even \u201c \u2018had the error not occurred, the verdict would have been the same.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 190, 416 S.E.2d at 24 (quoting <em>Lavinder, </em>12 Va. App. at 1005, 407 S.E.2d at 911). Moreover, we are satisfied that Weller received a fair trial and that substantial justice has been achieved. Weller does not challenge the sufficiency of the evidence to support his convictions. The sufficiency of that evidence is not lessened by the error in preventing the disclosure of the description of the ring he offered to sell three weeks prior to Baker\u2019s death.</p>\n<p id=\"b938-9\">For these reasons, we affirm Weller\u2019s convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b938-10\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b938-11\">Bray, X, concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b930-11\"> When the case was argued, Judge Koontz presided.

Even if I accept the majority\u2019s conclusion that the statement is not an explicit assertion that the victim had the rings, other parts of the witness\u2019s testimony <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"898\">*898</page-number>concerning the victim\u2019s out-of-court statements cannot be so easily dismissed. The statement, \u201cshe shook her hand and her wedding ring,\u201d is an assertion offered \u201cto evidence the truth of the matter asserted.\u201d <em>Eckhart </em>v. Commonwealth, 222 Va. 213, 216, 279 S.E.2d 155, 157 (1981).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b940-5\">It is clear that the statement \u201cshe shook her hand and her wedding ring\u201d can only be taken as an assertion to prove the truth of the matter asserted. The witness\u2019s recitation of the victim\u2019s out-of-court conduct of shaking her hand and her wedding ring was intended as an assertion that the victim possessed the rings at that time.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> \u201cNonverbal conduct . . . intended ... as an assertion and offered in evidence to prove the truth of the matter asserted falls within the ban on hearsay evidence.\u201d <em>Stevenson v. </em>Commonwealth, 218 Va. 462, 465, 237 S.E.2d 779, 781 (1977). To the extent that the Commonwealth offered the victim\u2019s nonverbal conduct and statements, which were communicated to the witness for the purpose of proving that the victim possessed the rings at the time of the conversation, the Commonwealth has offered this particular assertion as evidence of the truth of its contents. <em>See Donahue </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>225 Va. 145, 152, 300 S.E.2d 768, 772 (1983). The Commonwealth sought to have the jury assess the credibility of the victim through the witness\u2019s belief of the victim\u2019s truthfulness at the time the assertion was made over the telephone. That is an impermissible mode of proof. <em>Id.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b940-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b940-7\">I also disagree with the majority\u2019s conclusion that the trial judge properly excluded testimony that James Miles, who was in the vicinity of the house as it was burning, had a twenty-two caliber weapon. In his defense, Weller sought to prove that Miles had the opportunity and motive to commit the offense. The fact that Miles owned a twenty-two caliber weapon was other evidence that had a tendency to establish Weller\u2019s defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b941-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"899\">*899</page-number>The Commonwealth argued that the evidence proved that Miles\u2019s gun \u201cwas virtually excluded by virtue of the ballistics tests on Weller\u2019s gun.\u201d I disagree. The evidence at trial proved that Weller\u2019s gun had rifling characteristics consistent with the recovered bullets. The evidence at trial also proved, however, that those same rifling characteristics are present in firearms manufactured by 48 different manufacturers and might be present in \u201cseveral hundreds of thousands of ... 22 caliber weapons.\u201d This evidence did not exclude Miles\u2019s gun as the murder weapon. Accordingly, I would hold that testimony concerning Miles\u2019s ownership and possession of a twenty-two caliber weapon was relevant, material, and was improperly excluded.</p>\n<p id=\"b941-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b941-6\">I further disagree with the majority that the record does not prove that Miles was an adverse witness. An adverse witness is a \u201cwitness which the party <em>knows in advance </em>is hostile but which the party elects (or is forced) to call anyway.\u201d Charles E. Friend, <em>The Law of Evidence in Virginia </em>\u00a7 33(2) (3d ed. 1988). A party can ask the trial judge to declare a witness to be an \u201cadverse witness\u201d before the witness is on the stand. <em>See Daniels </em>v. <em>Morris, </em>199 Va. 205, 211, 98 S.E.2d 694, 698 (1957). Moreover, a trial judge may, at any time, put appropriate questions to a witness to determine whether the witness is indeed adverse or hostile. Charles E. Torcia, <em>Wharton\u2019s Criminal Evidence </em>\u00a7 378 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b941-7\">Weller\u2019s counsel proffered to the trial judge that Miles refused to speak to him, that Miles was hostile to his inquiries, that Miles cooperated extensively with the Commonwealth, and that Miles had said Weller was at the scene of the fire. Moreover, Miles was alleged by Weller to be the person who committed the murder for which Weller was being tried. This proffer sufficed to establish that Miles\u2019s testimony was adverse and hostile to Weller.</p>\n<p id=\"b941-8\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b941-9\">I agree with the majority that the trial judge improperly excluded testimony by Pamela Baker concerning Weller\u2019s offer to sell a ring to her three weeks prior to the murder. I do not agree that the error was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b941-10\">\u201cTrial error is presumed to be prejudicial and a fair trial on the merits and substantial justice are not achieved if an error at trial has affected the verdict.\u201d <em>Hanson v. Commonwealth, </em>14 Va. App. 173, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"900\">*900</page-number>189-90, 416 S.E.2d 14, 24 (1992). This case was entirely circumstantial. The Commonwealth\u2019s case relied in large measure upon proof that the victim possessed her rings the day before her death. The defense offered evidence that tended to contradict the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence. Baker\u2019s testimony may have been pivotal in convincing the jury that Weller\u2019s version of the events was more believable than the version offered by the Commonwealth.</p>\n<p id=\"b942-5\">Accordingly, I would reverse the convictions and remand for a new trial.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b940-8\"> The majority opinion states in footnote 1 that \u201c[ojbviously, [the witness] could not see [the victim\u2019s] hand motions over the telephone.\u201d Although I agree with that observation, I do not agree with the majority\u2019s assertion that the witness\u2019s testimony was merely a reflection of her \u201cexperience concerning [the victim\u2019s] reasons for wanting the rings repaired.\u201d The witness\u2019s testimony that the victim \u201cshook her hand and her wedding ring\u201d is an indication that it happened. The reasonable inference is either that the victim told the witness what she was doing or that the witness heard what she testified to.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
