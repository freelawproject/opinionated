Harshaw, Jr. (defendant) was simultaneously tried and convicted by the trial court on indictments charging distribution of marijuana, possession of marijuana and possession of marijuana with intent to distribute. He appeals, complaining that the court erred in admitting certificates of drug analysis (certificates) into evidence because the related chain-of-custody was not properly established, and that the Commonwealth failed to comply with the filing requirements of Code \u00a7 19.2-187. We disagree and affirm the decision of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-10\">The record discloses that Officer Mark G. Seleski (Seleski) \u201cpurchased an ounce of marijuana\u201d from defendant on October 30, 1990. Immediately following the transaction, Seleski \u201cresponded back to police headquarters\u201d and \u201cturned the ounce over\u201d to Detective Ronald W. Young (Young). When defendant again attempted to sell Seleski a \u201cbag\u201d of marijuana on November 1, 1990, he was arrested, and Young discovered and seized \u201cseven bags\u201d of marijuana in his residence.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-11\">Young \u201ckept [the marijuana] in [his] possession,\u201d in \u201ca locked locker inside a safe,\u201d to which \u201conly [he] had the key,\u201d until he \u201cpackaged,\u201d \u201cinitial[ed]\u201d and \u201cdropped [it] in the mailbox for Detective Taylor to deliver to the forensic lab\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> (lab or laboratory) on November 5, 1990. Detective Deborah S. Taylor (Taylor) \u201creceived <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>[the marijuana] in [her] locker,\u201d to which she had \u201cthe only key,\u201d and retained it until \u2018 \u2018hand-delivered\u2019 \u2019 by her to \u2018 \u2018Raymond Puryear (Puryear) at the lab\u201d on November 7, 1990. Upon receipt, and in Taylor\u2019s presence, \u201cMr. Puryear assigned . . . number[s]\u201d to the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-5\">Taylor later returned to the \u201clab\u201d and \u201cpicked ... up\u201d the evidence, still marked with \u201cYoung\u2019s initials\u201d and numbered as assigned by Puryear, and the two related certificates, signed by Susan Stanitski, the laboratory \u201cchemist\u201d identified by Taylor as \u201cinvolved\u201d in the \u201canalysis.\u201d It was uncontroverted that these certificates were filed with the clerk of the trial court in accordance with Code \u00a7 19.2-187, but placed only in the \u201ctwo files\u201d pertaining to the offenses of November 1, 1990, possession of marijuana and possession of marijuana with intent to distribute.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-6\">When the Commonwealth offered into evidence that certificate relevant to the October 30, 1990 offense, distribution of marijuana, defendant objected, arguing that, though \u201cfound in one of the other files,\u201d it was not in \u2018 \u2018the file for the October 30th charge\u2019 \u2019 and, consequently, inadmissible. He further contended that the Commonwealth failed to \u201cshow who received\u201d the evidence for analysis or \u201cto prove what happened while it was in the lab.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b113-7\">Code \u00a7 19.2-187 provides, <em>inter alia, </em>that a certificate of analysis shall be admissible in evidence \u201cprovided (i) the certificate of analysis is filed with the clerk of the court hearing the case at least seven days prior to the hearing or trial and (ii) a copy of such certificate is mailed or delivered ... to counsel of record for the accused at least seven days prior to the hearing or trial upon request of such counsel.\u201d This statute \u201csets forth a specific statement of admissibility of certificates\u201d and once its \u201cprovisos are satisfied, the statement. . . is complete, and a certificate thus qualified is properly received into evidence.\u201d <em>Stokes </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>11 Va. App. 550, 552, 399 S.E.2d 453, 454 (1991); <em>see also Mostyn v. Commonwealth, </em>14 Va. App. 920, 922-23, 420 S.E.2d 519, 520 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b113-8\">Well established \u201cprinciples of statutory construction require\u201d that we \u201cascertain and give effect to the legislative intent,\u201d and the \u201cplain, obvious, and rational meaning of a statute is always preferred.\u201d <em>Branch v. Commonwealth, </em>14 Va. App. 836, 839, 419 S.E.2d 422, 424 (1992). While Code \u00a7 19.2-187 must be construed \u201cstrictly against the Commonwealth and in favor of the accused,\u201d a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>\u201crule . . . particularly applicable to the filing requirements\u201d of the statute, <em>Gray v. </em>Commonwealth, 220 Va. 943, 945, 265 S.E.2d 705, 706 (1980) (citations omitted), proviso (i) mandates only \u201cthat the certificate be <em>filed.\u2019\u2019'\u2019 Carter v. Commonwealth, </em>12 Va. App. 156, 158, 403 S.E.2d 360, 361 (1991) (emphasis added); <em>see Mostyn, </em>14 Va. App. at 922, 420 S.E.2d at 520. Its obvious and recognized.\u201cpurpose ... \u2018is to ensure that the certificate ... is lodged timely in a secure and appropriate place, accessible to the accused, and available to him upon request.\u2019 \u201d <em>Mostyn, </em>14 Va. App. at 923, 420 S.E.2d at 521 (quoting <em>Stokes, </em>11 Va. App. at 552, 399 S.E.2d at 454); <em>see Carter, </em>12 Va. App. at 158, 403 S.E.2d at 361.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-5\">Here, the record is clear that the challenged certificate was properly filed with the clerk \u201cat least seven days prior\u201d to trial in compliance with Code \u00a7 19.2-187. Doubtless, it was thereafter accessible and available to defendant because it was lodged with another certificate which related to simultaneously tried offenses. Under these circumstances, both the letter and spirit of Code \u00a7 19.2-187 were fully satisfied.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b114-6\">We turn next to defendant\u2019s assertion that the chain-of-custody of the evidence was not sufficiently established because the Commonwealth did not prove that Puryear was \u201can authorized agent of the laboratory.\u201d Code \u00a7 19.2-187.01 provides that a \u201creport of analysis . . . shall be prima facie evidence ... as to the custody of the material described therein from the time such material is received by an authorized agent . . . until such material is released subsequent to such analysis.\u201d The statute further provides that the \u201csignature of the person who received the material ... on the request for laboratory examination form shall be deemed prima facie evidence that the person receiving the material was an authorized agent.\u201d Code \u00a7 19.2-187.01.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-7\">However, contrary to defendant\u2019s argument, Code \u00a7 19.2-187.01 does not \u201cspecifically require\u201d the Commonwealth to identify the recipient only through a \u201crequest for laboratory examination form.\u201d The agency relationship prescribed by the statute may be established by other evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>In this instance, Taylor testified that she \u201chand-delivered\u201d the evidence specifically to Puryear, \u201cat the lab,\u201d who proceeded to \u201cassign[] . . . number[s]\u201d to it. When later retrieved by Taylor, these numbers remained with the evidence, which she recognized and identified. Additionally, the related certificates were signed by a person known to Taylor as the laboratory chemist who had conducted the \u201canalysis.\u201d This evidence sufficiently proved that the material had been properly received by an \u201cauthorized agent,\u201d thus establishing \u201cprima facie evidence\u201d of its \u201ccustody\u201d pursuant to Code \u00a7 19.2-187.01.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-5\">Accordingly, the decision of the trial court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b115-7\">Baker, J., and Barrow, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b112-12\"> A \u201claboratory operated by ... the Division of Forensic Science\u201d of the Commonwealth of Virginia.
