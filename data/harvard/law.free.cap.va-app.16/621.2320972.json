He contends on appeal that the Commonwealth failed to prove all requisite elements of the offense. We agree and reverse the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-11\">Under familiar principles of appellate review, we examine the evidence in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, granting to it all reasonable inferences fairly deducible therefrom. <em>Martin v. Commonwealth, </em>4 Va. App. 438, 443, 358 S.E.2d 415, 418 (1987). The judgment of a trial court sitting without a jury is entitled to the same weight as a jury verdict and will be disturbed only if plainly wrong or without evidence to support it. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b664-12\">The record discloses that defendant was incarcerated in the Lynchburg City Jail, after being \u201csentenced to confinement in the penitentiary of the Commonwealth\u201d for two successive one year terms on convictions unrelated to this appeal. On July 19, 1991, the trial court, acting on defendant\u2019s motion, ordered \u201cthat the Sheriff. . . shall allow the defendant. . . [to] be released . . . from jail\u201d from 3:00 p.m. until 6:00 p.m. that same day \u201cfor the purpose of attending [a] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"623\">*623</page-number>funeral.\u201d The order made no mention of supervision during this furlough,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> but, before release, defendant was advised by the Chief Jailer that he \u201cwould be subject to be charged with escape\u201d if he did not comply with the terms of the order.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-5\">When defendant failed to return as scheduled, correction officials \u201csecured\u201d a \u201cwarrant for escape,\u201d and he was subsequently apprehended and indicted for violating Code \u00a7 53.1-203, which provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b665-6\">It shall be unlawful for a prisoner in a state, local or community correctional facility or in the custody of an employee thereof to:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b665-7\">1. Escape from a correctional facility or from any person in charge of such prisoner.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b665-8\">Because defendant was not released \u201cin the custody of an employee\u201d of a \u201ccorrectional facility,\u201d we must first determine whether he, nevertheless, remained \u201ca prisoner in a . . . correctional facility\u201d while on furlough. We have previously held that the \u201cterm \u2018prisoner in a . . . correctional facility\u2019 refers to the status of the escapee, not to the circumstances of escape.\u201d <em>Mabe v. Commonwealth, </em>14 Va. App. 439, 441, 417 S.E.2d 899, 900 (1992); see <em>also Ruffin v. Commonwealth, </em>62 Va. (21 Gratt.) 790, 798 (1871). This status is not dependent upon actual physical presence in such facility or otherwise restricted by a prisoner\u2019s location. <em>Mabe, </em>14 Va. App. at 440, 417 S.E.2d at 900. Thus, although defendant had been granted a three hour furlough,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> he remained \u201cin every sense, a \u2018prisoner in a . . . correctional facility.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 441, 417 S.E.2d at 900.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-9\">However, defendant\u2019s status alone does not support a conviction under Code \u00a7 53.1-203(1). The Commonwealth must also prove that he either \u201c[e]scape[d] from a correctional facility or from any person in charge of [him].\u201d <em>Id. </em>Without question, defendant did not escape \u201cfrom any person in charge of [him].\u201d Unlike the accused in <em>Mabe, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"624\">*624</page-number>who was placed \u201cunder the supervision of ... an employee\u201d at a \u201cSenior Citizen\u2019s C\u00e9nter,\u201d defendant here was free on an unsupervised furlough. 14 Va. App. at 440-41, 417 S.E.2d at 900. Nothing in this record suggests that he was released into the custody or supervision of \u201cany person\u201d to be \u201cin charge of\u201d him.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-4\">We must, therefore, decide whether defendant\u2019s failure to return to jail in accordance with the terms of the order constituted an \u201c[ejscape <em>from </em>a correctional facility\u201d in violation of the statute. Code \u00a7 53.1-203(1) (emphasis added). In resolving this question, we are guided by the fundamental principle of statutory construction that penal statutes 4 4 \u2018must be strictly construed against the state and limited in application to cases falling clearly within the language of the statute.\u2019 \u201d <em>Davis </em>v. Commonwealth, 12 Va. App. 246, 248, 402 S.E.2d 711, 712 (1991) (quoting <em>Crews v. </em>Commonwealth, 3 Va. App. 531, 536, 352 S.E.2d 1, 3 (1987)); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Knott, 11 Va. App. 44, 47, 396 S.E.2d 148, 150 (1990). When the \u201cwords of [a] statute are clear and unambiguous, judicial construction is not required\u201d and we \u201cmust . . . give them their plain meaning.\u201d <em>Diggs v. Commonwealth, 6 </em>Va. App. 300, 302, 369 S.E.2d 199, 200 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b666-5\">Guided by these precepts, we find that the language \u201c[ejscape from a correctional facility\u201d does not embrace the failure of a prisoner to return from an authorized absence such as the one now before the Court. \u201cFrom\u201d is a \u201cfunction word to indicate a starting point: as (1) a place where a physical movement begins.\u201d <em>Webster\u2019s Ninth New Collegiate Dictionary </em>494 (1989). Thus, to escape <em>\u201cfrom\u201d </em>a correctional facility, the prisoner must first be physically present within such facility. If the legislature had intended otherwise, the disjunctive phrase \u201cor from any person in charge of such prisoner\u201d would have been unnecessary to the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-6\">Therefore, because defendant had been released without supervision and was no longer physically present in the facility, we find that he did not escape in violation of Code \u00a7 53.1-203(1).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b667-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"625\">*625</page-number>Accordingly, the decision of the trial court is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-5\">\n<em>Reversed and final judgment.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"Ado\">Coleman, J., and Koontz, J.,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b665-10\"> Both counsel use this term to refer to the release and we adopt it here in the interests of clarity and continuity.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b665-11\"> Code \u00a7 19.2-303 permits a trial judge to retain jurisdiction to modify a sentence beyond the twenty-one day limit of Rule 1; 1 if the person sentenced for a felony has not yet been transferred to the Department of Corrections. <em>D\u2018Alessandro </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>15 Va.
