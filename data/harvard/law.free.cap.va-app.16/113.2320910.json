Cole appeals from his conviction for robbery under Code \u00a7 18.2-58. He claims the trial court erred in allowing the Commonwealth, on cross-examination, to name appellant\u2019s specific prior felony convictions. After examining the record, we conclude that, although the trial court did err, that error was harmless. Accordingly, we affirm appellant\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-10\">In reviewing the trial court\u2019s ruling, we are guided by the principle that \u201c[t]he admissibility of evidence is within the broad discretion of the trial court, and . . . will not be disturbed on appeal in the absence of an abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>Blain v. Commonwealth, </em>7 Va. App. 10, 16, 371 S.E.2d 838, 842 (1988) (citation omitted). The issue to which we apply that standard here concerns the proper methods for impeachment of a criminal defendant based on prior felony or perjury convictions. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 19.2-269. Two such methods exist under current Virginia law, both of which are discussed at length in this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Powell v. Commonwealth, </em>13 Va. App. 17, 23, 409 S.E.2d 622, 626 (1991). The first method allows proof of prior felony convictions and their number. <em>Id. </em>(citing Code \u00a7 19.2-269; <em>Sadoski v. Commonwealth, </em>219 Va. 1069, 1070, 254 S.E.2d 100, 101 (1979)). The second method allows impeachment through evidence that appellant testified untruthfully about a material fact. <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>McAmis </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>225 Va. 419, 422, 304 S.E.2d 2, 4 (1983); <em>Santmier </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, 211 </em>Va. 318, 319, 228 S.E.2d 681, 682 (1976)). For <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>example, if appellant \u2018 \u2018testifies untruthfully about \u2018the fact of conviction\u2019 or the number of prior felony offenses, the Commonwealth may show that [hej has knowingly testified untruthfully about a material fact.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 23-24, 409 S.E.2d at 626.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-5\">In <em>Powell, </em>the Court further clarified the limits of these methods of impeachment, holding that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b157-6\">where ... a defendant/witness testifies untruthfully on direct examination about the number of prior felony convictions, he opens the door to cross-examination which is reasonably designed to elicit relevant evidence to show whether the defendant/witness knowingly testified falsely. The Commonwealth may not, however, resort to cross-examination which unnecessarily presents prejudicial information about the name or nature of prior convictions with little or no probative value.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b157-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 24, 409 S.E.2d at 626.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-8\">Although the facts of this case appear to be very similar to those in <em>Powell, </em>significant differences exist. In <em>Powell, </em>the Commonwealth\u2019s attorney originally named appellant\u2019s prior convictions. In this case, by contrast, appellant himself first volunteered the name of one of the felonies for which he had been convicted\u2014grand larceny\u2014without being asked to do so by the Commonwealth. The Commonwealth asserts that appellant opened the door to questioning about the names and nature of his prior convictions, citing <em>Harmon v. Commonwealth, </em>212 Va. 442, 185 S.E.2d 48 (1971), in support. In <em>Harmon, </em>appellant testified on direct examination that he had been convicted of a prior killing, and the court held that this testimony opened the door to questioning by the Commonwealth on cross-examination as to the degree of the homicide. <em>Id. </em>at 445, 185 S.E.2d at 51.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-9\">We hold in this case that appellant opened the door to questioning about one conviction for grand larceny. In attempting to clarify appellant\u2019s answer, however, the Commonwealth mentioned a second conviction for grand larceny. As outlined in <em>Powell, </em>the Commonwealth had other alternatives available through which to prove that appellant had testified untruthfully. It could, for example, have questioned appellant by naming the courts and the dates on which it thought he had received felony convictions. Alternatively, it could have presented appellant with properly authenticated copies of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>his prior felony convictions. Such alternative avenues \u201cmust be pursued before the Commonwealth can inquire about the name and nature of the prior offenses, and even then, the Commonwealth must show that proof of the name and nature of the convictions is relevant and outweighs the prejudice caused by such disclosure.\u201d <em>Powell, </em>13 Va. App. at 26, 409 S.E.2d at 628. Because the Commonwealth failed to pursue these alternative approaches, we hold that the trial court abused its discretion in allowing the Commonwealth to question appellant as to the identity and nature of his second felony grand larceny conviction and his misdemeanor concealment conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-5\">Appellant argues that, under the reasoning in <em>Powell, </em>this error constitutes grounds for reversal of his conviction. In spite of this error, however, one other critical fact distinguishes these two cases: <em>Powell </em>involved a jury serving as the trier of fact, whereas this case involved trial before a judge. \u201cA judge, unlike a juror, is uniquely suited by training, experience and judicial discipline to disregard potentially prejudicial comments and to separate, during the mental process of adjudication, the admissible from the inadmissible, even though he has heard both.\u201d <em>Eckhart </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>222 Va. 213, 216, 279 S.E.2d 155, 157 (1981). Consequently, we presume that a trial judge disregards prejudicial or inadmissible evidence. <em>Hall </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>14 Va. App. 892, 902, 421 S.E.2d 455, 462 (1992) (en banc). Finally, \u201cthis presumption will control in the absence of clear evidence to the contrary.\u201d Here, the evidence concerning appellant\u2019s prior convictions was relevant only as it pertained to his credibility, and, absent some indication to the contrary in the record, we must presume that the trial judge considered it for that limited purpose only. Although some of this evidence was improper, even when limited to the issue of credibility, the judge\u2019s consideration of it for that purpose was harmless error, for appellant himself had already volunteered information concerning a separate grand larceny conviction. This is not to say that the admission of improper evidence in a bench trial may never result in reversible error. Where the record makes clear that the judge considered such inadmissible evidence in adjudicating the merits of the case, reversal would be appropriate. However, where, as here, the record is devoid of such implications, we must presume that the trial judge considered the evidence for the limited purpose of assessing credibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-6\">Appellant has failed to show a manifest probability that the admission of this evidence prejudiced his ability to receive a fair trial. He <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>has not claimed that, absent the introduction of the testimony concerning his prior felonies, the evidence would have been insufficient to convict him. Accordingly, we hold that the error was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-5\">For the aforementioned reasons, we affirm appellant\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b159-7\">Bray, J., and Willis, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
