Barnes (claimant) appeals a decision of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Commission (commission) which terminated her benefits \u201cfor having prejudiced the rights of subrogation\u201d of Wise Fashions (employer) and American Manufacturers Mutual Insurance Company (carrier). Claimant argues that the commission erred in concluding that injuries suffered in an automobile collision adversely affected her recovery from a previous compensable accident and that she failed to obtain her employer\u2019s requisite consent to settle the tort claim. Claimant also contends that the commission improperly declined to hear oral argument incident to its review of the deputy commissioner\u2019s decision. We disagree and affirm the decision of the commission.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b151-10\">On appellate review, we must construe the evidence in the light most favorable to the party prevailing below. <em>Crisp </em>v. <em>Brown\u2019s Tysons Corner Dodge, Inc., </em>1 Va. App. 503, 504, 339 S.E.2d 916, 916 (1986). Factual findings by the commission that are supported by credible evidence are conclusive and binding upon this Court on appeal. <em>Rose </em>v. <em>Red\u2019s Hitch &amp; Trailer Servs., Inc., </em>11 Va. App. 55, 60, 396 S.E.2d 392, 395 (1990); <em>Commonwealth v. Powell, </em>2 Va. App. 712, 714, 347 S.E.2d 532, 533 (1986). The existence of contrary evidence in the record is of no consequence if credible evidence supports the commission\u2019s findings. <em>Wagner Enters., Inc. v. Brooks, </em>12 Va. App. 890, 894, 407 S.E.2d 32,35 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b152-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>The record discloses that claimant sustained a compensable injury to her back and right leg in 1984 and thereafter received temporary total disability benefits. On April 3, 1987, she was involved in an automobile accident, which, though unrelated to her employment, aggravated the compensable injuries. Claimant subsequently settled with and released the tortfeasor without the approval or participation of employer, despite knowledge of employer\u2019s \u201cinterest\u201d and its then pending petition to intervene in the civil litigation. When employer learned of the settlement, it filed an application with the commission to terminate benefits, alleging that claimant had wrongfully impaired its statutory right of subrogation against the third party. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7\u00a7 65.2-309 and 65.2-812.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-5\">After consideration of the evidence, the deputy commissioner determined that \u201c[ijnformation . . . indicates that the employer was aware of settlement negotiations and allowed to play a role therein\u201d and refused to terminate benefits. In a June 7, 1991 review opinion, the commission disagreed, finding that \u201cthe carrier did not play a role in the settlement negotiations but was only advised of the result after the fact,\u201d and \u201cremanded\u201d the case for \u201cdetermination of the carrier\u2019s subrogation rights.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b152-6\">On remand, the only substantive medical evidence before the deputy commissioner was provided by Dr. Alfred P. Magness, claimaint\u2019s treating physician. Magness\u2019 reports included a recommendation in October, 1986, that claimant \u201clook for a light duty type position,\u201d a \u201cstatus\u201d which he modified in August, 1987, because \u201cher automobile accident had . . . intervened.\u201d However, in October, 1987, Magness. opined that claimant was \u201c[injcapable of returning to work <em>before </em>her automobile accident,\u201d and, in August, 1990, that she \u201cwas disabled permanently <em>prior </em>to her automobile accident\u2019 \u2019 (emphasis added). Based upon this evidence, the deputy commissioner concluded that the \u201cautomobile accident . . . significantly affected [claimant\u2019s] recovery by further aggravating an already weakened spine\u2019 \u2019 and terminated benefits because \u201cclaimant failed to give the employer prior notice of the proposed settlement or to obtain its consent to it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b152-7\">Claimant appealed to the full commission and requested \u201coral argument.\u201d The commission, however, affirmed the deputy commissioner without oral argument, finding that, \u201c[i]n view of the exacerbation of the claimant\u2019s industrial back injury by the automobile accident, the employer would have a subrogation right against the third parties, and it is obvious this right has been destroyed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b153-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>It is well established that \u201can employer is subrogated to the rights of an employee against any other party causing an injury ... for which the employer is required to provide compensation under the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act.\u201d <em>Green v. Warwick Plumbing &amp; Heating, </em>5 Va. App. 409, 411, 364 S.E.2d 4, 6, <em>appeal dismissed, </em>371 S.E.2d 7 (Va. 1988); <em>see also </em>Code \u00a7 65.2-309 and 65.2-812. \u201cNo distinction is made between the liability of a third person who causes an original injury and one who causes an aggravation of an injury.\u201d <em>Green, </em>5 Va. App. at 411, 364 S.E.2d at 6. An \u201cimpairment of the right of subrogation through settlement without knowledge or consent of the employer results in termination of compensation benefits even though an employer may have knowledge of the pending third party action.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 413, 364 S.E.2d at 6-7; <em>Safety-Kleen Corp. </em>v. <em>Van Hoy, </em>225 Va. 64, 70-71, 300 S.E.2d 750, 754 (1983); <em>Streich v. Tidewater Dock &amp; Structures, Inc., </em>14 Va. App. 779, 781, 418 S.E.2d 913, 914 (1992); <em>Ball v. C.D.W. Enters., </em>Inc., 13 Va. App. 470, 474, 413 S.E.2d 66, 68-69 (1992); <em>City of Newport News v. Blankenship, </em>10 Va. App. 704, 706, 396 S.E.2d 145, 146 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b153-5\">In this instance, it is uncontroverted that claimant\u2019s counsel first notified employer\u2019s counsel of the third-party settlement after it had been effected. Thus, credible evidence supports the commission\u2019s finding that \u201cthe carrier did not play a role in the settlement negotiations but was only advised of the result after the fact.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b153-6\">Claimant further argues, however, that the commission erred in determining that the automobile accident adversely affected her recovery from the industrial accident. In support of her position, claimant relies upon Dr. Magness\u2019 later reports of permanent disability predating the automobile accident. Nevertheless, the commission\u2019s finding that claimant\u2019s \u201cautomobile accident. . . aggravated [her] back condition\u201d is supported by Dr. Magness\u2019 earlier recommendation of light duty work, which he withdrew only after the injuries of the automobile accident \u201cintervened.\u201d The commission simply resolved an apparent conflict in the several opinions of the \u201csole expert,\u201d Dr. Magness, against claimant, a decision supported by credible evidence and, thus, conclusive and binding upon us. <em>See Chandler </em>v. <em>Schmidt Baking Co., </em>228 Va. 265, 267-68, 321 S.E.2d 296, 297-98 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b154-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>Finally, claimant contends that the commission erred in refusing to entertain oral argument during its review of the deputy commissioner\u2019s decision. On \u201can application for review,\u201d Code \u00a7 65.2-705 permits the full commission to \u201chear the parties at issue, their representatives, and witnesses,\u201d \u201cif deemed advisable,\u201d according to the sound discretion of the commission. Because the parties were permitted to file \u201cWritten Statements\u201d prior to the decision in this instance, \u201c[a]ll [claimant] lost was the chance to restate that which was already adequately stated in . . . other written communications to the Commission.\u201d <em>Henrico County Sch. Bd v. Bohle, </em>14 Va. App. 801, 804, 421 S.E.2d 8, 10 (1992) (quoting <em>James v. Arlington County Bd. of Supervisors, </em>226 Va. 284, 290, 307 S.E.2d 900, 903 (1983)). Under these circumstances, we find no abuse of discretion in the commission\u2019s denial of claimant\u2019s request to present oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-5\">Accordingly, the decision of the commission is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b154-7\">Willis, J., and Elder, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b151-11\"> We have not addressed all issues argued by employer because the commission\u2019s decision is affirmed on other grounds.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
