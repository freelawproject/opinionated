We hold that a dwelling referred to in that section as \u201ctemporarily unoccupied\u201d is one that is currently uninhabited, not one from which its occupants are merely absent at the time it is burned. Thus, when the defendant burned the house in which he and others lived, he was guilty of a Class 2 felony, rather than a Class 3 felony, even though no one was in the house at the time. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 18.2-77.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b49-7\">The defendant and two sub-tenants, a woman and her nine-year-old daughter, lived in the house that the defendant burned. At the time of the fire, the woman and her daughter had gone out to rent a movie. After starting the fire, the defendant also left. The trial court concluded that the house was not \u201ctemporarily unoccupied\u201d and found the defendant guilty of a Class 2 felony.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-8\">The defendant submitted that he was guilty of a Class 3 felony, rather than a Class 2 felony, at sentencing, not at trial when he was found guilty. However, the trial court, sitting without a jury, had a full opportunity to consider the issue and did consider it at the sentencing hearing. Therefore, we conclude that the issue was timely raised and that the defendant is not barred from raising the issue on appeal. <em>See Campbell v. </em>Commonwealth, 12 Va. App. 476, 480, 405 S.E.2d 1, 2 (1991) (enbanc).</p>\n<p id=\"b49-9\">The legislature\u2019s interest in using the phrase \u201ctemporarily unoccupied\u201d is reflected in its choice of different language in two other related provisions of the Code. Burning a building \u201cnot usually occupied by persons lodging therein at night,\u201d is a Class 3 felony, if done <em>\u201cat a time when any person is </em>therein,\u201d but only a Class 4 felony if done <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number><em>\u201cwhen no person is in such </em>building.\u201d Code \u00a7 18.2-79 (emphasis added). Similarly, burning any other building or structure <em>\u201cat a time when no person is in such </em>building\u2019 \u2019 is a Class 4 felony, instead of a Class 3 felony, if otherwise. Code \u00a7 18.2-80 (emphasis added). Had the legislature intended, in Code \u00a7 18.2-77, to distinguish whether or not a person was in a building at the time it was burned or destroyed, it would have used language similar to that used in Code \u00a7\u00a7 18.2-79 and 18.2-80. The phrase \u201ctemporarily unoccupied,\u201d therefore, has a different meaning.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-5\">Other courts have defined when a dwelling house is \u201ctemporarily unoccupied.\u201d At common law, arson occurred even if the occupants of a dwelling were \u201ctemporarily absent at the time of [its] buming.\u201d <em>State v. Gulley, </em>46 N.C. App. 822, 823, 266 S.E.2d 8, 8 (1980). Thus, the burning of a dwelling that is \u201cmerely temporarily unoccupied\u201d is arson. <em>Id. </em>A structure is \u201ctemporarily unoccupied\u201d if it is \u2018 \u2018dedicated and intended for residential use, and ... is not presently occupied as a person\u2019s habitation, but. . . has [not] been permanently abandoned nor vacant for a prolonged period of time.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Green, </em>18 Ohio App. 3d 69, 72, 480 N.E.2d 1128, 1132 (1984). <em>See also Newman v. State, </em>154 Ind. App. 408, 410, 290 N.E.2d 133, 134 (1972) (dwelling not \u201ctemporarily unoccupied\u201d when \u201cleft empty temporarily\u201d); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Kingsbury, </em>378 Mass. 751, 756-57, 393 N.E.2d 391, 394 (1979) (an apartment rented, but not yet occupied, is neither inhabited nor \u201ctemporarily unoccupied\u201d); <em>State v. Scarberry, </em>187 W. Va. 251, 254, 418 S.E.2d 361, 364 (1992) (a structure is no longer a dwelling house when occupants leave without intention to return).</p>\n<p id=\"b50-7\">We hold that a dwelling from which its inhabitants are absent temporarily with an intention to return is not \u201ctemporarily unoccupied\u201d within the meaning of Code \u00a7 18.2-77. Therefore, the defendant was properly convicted of a Class 2 felony, and the judgment of conviction is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-8\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b50-9\">Koontz, C.J., and Moon, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b49-10\"> Code \u00a7 18.2.-77 provides, in part:</p>\n<p id=\"b49-11\">If any person, in the nighttime, maliciously bum . . . any dwelling house or house trailer, whether the property of himself or of another,... or other house in which persons usually dwell or lodge,... he shall be guilty of a Class 2 felony; but if the jury or the court trying the case without a jury finds that at the time of committing the offense, such dwelling house . . . was temporarily unoccupied, the offender shall be guilty of a Class 3 felony.
