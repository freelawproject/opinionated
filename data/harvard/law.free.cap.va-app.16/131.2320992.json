Southern challenges the commission\u2019s findings that claimant\u2019s hip condition was causally related to his prior compensable back injury. Southern argues that the claimant\u2019s hip injury is unrelated to the original back injury. In addition, Southern argues that claimant\u2019s hip injury resulted from cumulative trauma and, therefore, is not compensable as an injury by accident. We disagree and affirm the commission\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-11\">On October 16, 1990, claimant was injured in the course of employment while \u201cturning a steel beam.\u201d That same day, claimant was examined in the emergency room of the National Hospital for Orthopaedics and Rehabilitation. The emergency room physician diagnosed the injury as a strain to the lumbar region. On October 18, 1990, claimant returned to the hospital and was examined by Dr. Alexander. Claimant complained of severe pain in his left lower back with radiation down the left leg. Dr. Alexander diagnosed the injury as \u201cacute lumbosacral strain and degenerative arthritis of the left hip.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b174-12\">A Memorandum of Agreement for compensation payment was approved by the commission on December 13, 1990. The award granted temporary total disability benefits from October 24, 1990 through November 25, 1990. In the Agreement, the injury was identified as \u201cacute lumbosacral strain.\u201d Although claimant\u2019s back injury subsided, his arthritic hip condition continued to prevent him from returning <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>to work. On May 13, 1991, Dr. Maurice Cates examined the claimant and found that he was totally disabled from October 18, 1990 as a result of severe osteoarthritis of the left hip.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-5\">On July 29, 1991, claimant filed an application for hearing with the commission alleging a change in condition as a result of his earlier back injury. He sought temporary total disability benefits on the basis that the <em>injury </em>to his back aggravated an underlying arthritic condition in his hip. At the hearing, Southern raised the defense that the hip disability was not causally related to the accident of October 16, 1990, but was a pre-existing, unrelated condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-6\">The deputy commissioner found that the pre-existing hip condition was causally related to the prior accident and that the injury aggravated claimant\u2019s arthritic hip condition and was thus compensable. This finding was based on the uncontradicted opinion of Dr. Alexander, who stated that the <em>injury </em>to claimant\u2019s back aggravated a quiescent condition of arthritis in the left hip. The evidence showed that before the back injury, the arthritic condition was asymptomatic. After the accident, the condition became disabling.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-7\">The full commission affirmed the award on the basis that an aggravation of a pre-existing condition resulting in work incapacity is sufficient to support an award for a change in condition. The commission found that as early as October 18, 1990, the claimant was complaining of the derivative hip problem and, accordingly, determined that a causal relationship existed, even though the prior Memorandum of Agreement failed to mention the hip injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-8\">Under the holding in <em>Leonard v. Arnold, </em>218 Va. 210, 237 S.E.2d 97 (1977), an award may be modified on a change of condition application, if the change is a \u2018 \u2018progression, deterioration, or aggravation of the compensable condition.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 215, 237 S.E.2d at 100. Southern argues that the compensable condition was an \u201cacute lumbosacral strain\u201d and that no evidence established that the arthritic condition was an aggravation or acceleration of the claimant\u2019s lumbosacral strain. However, as early as October 18, 1990, claimant complained of pain in his hip. The medical opinion of Dr. Alexander established that, although the claimant suffered from a pre-existing arthritic condition before the accident, the <em>injury </em>to claimant\u2019s back aggravated this asymptomatic condition, causing it to become symptomatic. Dr. Alexander\u2019s medical opinion was uncontradicted.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>A finding that a pre-existing condition was \u201caccelerated or aggravated\u201d by an injury sustained in an industrial accident establishes a causal connection between the injury and disability and the \u201cdisability resulting therefrom is compensable under the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act.\u201d <em>Olsten of Richmond </em>v. <em>Leftwich, </em>230 Va. 317, 320, 336 S.E.2d 893, 895 (1985) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b176-5\">The doctrine of compensable consequences supports the commission\u2019s finding that claimant\u2019s symptomatic hip condition was compensable because it resulted from the back injury occasioned by the accident of October 16, 1990. \u201c[Wjhere a causal connection between the initial compensable injury and the subsequent injury is established, ... the subsequent injury \u2018is treated as if it occurred in the course of and arising out of the employee\u2019s employment.\u2019 \u201d <em>Bartholow Drywall Co. v. Hill, </em>12 Va. App. 790, 794, 407 S.E.2d 1, 3 (1991) (quoting <em>Leonard, </em>218 Va. at 214, 237 S.E.2d at 100). A change of condition claim based on the aggravation of a prior compensable injury falls within this doctrine. <em>Bartholow, </em>12 Va. App. at 797, 407 S.E.2d at 5. The commission relied upon the statement by Dr. Alexander that, although the arthritic condition was not <em>caused </em>by the accident of October 16, 1990, it \u201cbrought the problem to the fore\u201d by aggravating the pre-existing condition and <em>causing </em>it to become symptomatic.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-6\">We disagree with Southern\u2019s assertion that the hip condition was the result of cumulative trauma. The commission found that claimant\u2019s hip condition was aggravated by his back injury and that finding is supported by credible evidence in the record. Factual findings by the commission that are supported by credible evidence are conclusive and binding upon this Court on appeal. Code \u00a7 65.2-706; <em>Manassas Ice &amp; Fuel Co. </em>v. <em>Farrar, </em>13 Va. App. 227, 229, 409 S.E.2d 824, 826 (1991). The medical evidence relied upon by the commission was uncontroverted. Therefore, credible evidence in the record supports the commission\u2019s finding. Accordingly, this finding will not be disturbed on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b176-8\">Benton, J., and Bray, I, concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
