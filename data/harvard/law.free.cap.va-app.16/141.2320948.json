Penton and John D. Hudgins appeal from their convictions under Norfolk City Code \u00a7 25-251 for driving while under the influence. Apart from the fact that Hudgins\u2019s offense occurred in May, 1991, and Penton\u2019s in June, 1991, the facts in each case are the same. Appellants argue that their convictions are invalid because the punishment prescribed in the ordinance exceeded the punishment authorized by state law at the time of the ordinance\u2019s enactment, thereby rendering the ordinance void from its inception. After examining the relevant statutes and ordinances, we find the ordinance valid insofar as it applies to driving while under the influence offenses, and we affirm appellants\u2019 convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-8\">These cases involve several interrelated state and local provisions proscribing driving while under the influence of alcohol or self-administered drugs. Code \u00a7 18.2-266 proscribes driving while under the influence of alcohol, and Code \u00a7 18.2-270 provides that a violation of that statute is a Class 1 misdemeanor. Prior to July 1, 1990, Code \u00a7 18.2-11 provided that the maximum punishment for a Class 1 misdemeanor was twelve months in jail and/or a $1,000 fine. Code \u00a7 15.1-132 grants cities within the state the authority to enact similar ordinances for driving while under the influence. Under that statute, \u201c[s]uch ordinances may provide the same penalties ... as are provided by general law for similar offenses,\u201d but \u201c[n]o such ordinance shall provide for a lesser punishment.\u201d Also applicable is Code \u00a7 15.1-901. Prior to February 21, 1991, that code section limited the penalties imposed by <em>any </em>municipal ordinance enacted pursuant to state authority to \u201ca fine of $1,000 or imprisonment ... for twelve months.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b185-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>Pursuant to the state\u2019s grant of authority under Code \u00a7 15.1-132, the City of Norfolk enacted Norfolk City Code \u00a7\u00a7 25-251 and 25-255, which follow the language of the state code sections proscribing driving while under the influence as a Class 1 misdemeanor. In keeping with the requirements of Code \u00a7 15.1-132 and the more general Code \u00a7 15.1-901, Norfolk dictated the same punishment for a Class 1 misdemeanor as did the Virginia Code\u2014a maximum of twelve months in jail and a $1,000 fine.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-5\">As of July 1, 1990, the General Assembly amended Virginia Code \u00a7 18.2-11 to increase the maximum punishment for a Class 1 misdemeanor to twelve months in jail and/or a $2,500 fine. At that point, the punishment provided for a conviction under the Norfolk City Code was less than that provided for conviction under the Virginia Code. Because Code \u00a7 15.1-132 requires that local ordinances enacted pursuant to it provide penalties equal to or greater than those specified in the Virginia Code, the City of Norfolk amended its Code \u00a7 1-11 to bring it into compliance, by Ordinance No. 36,110, effective July 17, 1990. Since July 17, 1990, the Virginia and Norfolk Codes have provided the same penalties for driving while under the influence.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-6\">In spite of Norfolk\u2019s efforts to comply with state law, the amendment of Norfolk City Code \u00a7 1-11 resulted in a violation of the more general portion of the Code, \u00a7 15.1-901. That section, as set forth above, limited the penalties for violation of local ordinances to \u201ca fine of $1,000 or imprisonment... for twelve months.\u201d When the Virginia General Assembly changed the maximum penalties allowed under Code \u00a7 18.2-11 to a fine of up to $2,500, it failed to amend Code \u00a7 15.1-901 to specify the same increased penalty. Accordingly, the City of Norfolk could not have crafted an ordinance that would have complied with both code sections. Subsequently, the General Assembly passed emergency legislation to bring Code \u00a7 15.1-901 into harmony with Code \u00a7 15.1-132 as of February 21, 1991.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> As a result of that amendment, Code \u00a7 15.1-901 no longer specifies a maximum penalty in terms of dollar amount or sentence length. Rather, it states that the punishment \u201cshall [not] exceed the penalty provided by general law for the violation of a Class 1 misdemeanor.\u201d All parties admit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>that the purpose of this amendment was to remedy a major inconsistency between these two code sections.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-5\">The City argues first that, regardless of whether the ordinance or any portion thereof was invalid at the time of its passage on July 17, 1990, the emergency legislation of February, 1991, validated the ordinance so that Norfolk City Code \u00a7 1-11 could properly be applied to appellants\u2019 offenses in May and June, 1991. Although we acknowledge that validation is possible under certain conditions, we hold that those conditions were not met here. The only Virginia example cited by the parties involved specific validating language. In repealing Title 15, the legislature specifically validated, via Code \u00a7 15.1-2, all ordinances passed pursuant to former Title 15.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Although the City cites persuasive authority for the proposition that such validation may result by implication, we are aware of no Virginia statutory or case law that so holds, and there appears to be a split of authority among other jurisdictions. <em>See, e.g., </em>5 Eugene McQuillin, <em>Municipal Corporations </em>\u00a7 16.94, at nn.5, 19, 20 (3d ed. 1989). Because the legislature, in amending Code \u00a7 15.1-901, expressed no intent to validate local ordinances called into question by the conflict between Code \u00a7 15.1-132 and 901, we hold that the amendment had no such validating effect. Although the February 1991, amendment gave Norfolk the authority to \u201cvalidate\u201d its own ordinance prospectively by re-enacting it, the City did not do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-6\">Despite the above analysis, we apply other principles of statutory construction to conclude that Norfolk City Code \u00a7 1-11 was nevertheless valid as applied to appellants\u2019 DUI offenses. Where two statutes appear to conflict, they should be construed, if reasonably possible, to give force and effect to each one. <em>Board of Supervisors </em>v. <em>Marshall, </em>215 Va. 756, 761, 214 S.E.2d 146, 150 (1975). To the extent that the statutes conflict, however, the specific statute prevails over the more general one. <em>See, e.g., Dodson </em>v. <em>Potomac Mack Sales &amp; Serv., Inc., </em>241 Va. 89, 94-95, 400 S.E.2d 178, 181 (1991). The more specific statutory scheme in this case is Code \u00a7 15.1-132, that grants to localities the authority to proscribe driving while under the influence. This code section states that \u201c[sjuch ordinances may provide the same penalties for violations thereof as are provided by gen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>eral law for similar offenses,\u201d but that they \u201cshall [not] provide for a lesser punishment.\u201d Those penalties as set forth in the state\u2019s general laws\u2014Code \u00a7\u00a7 18.2-11, 266 and 270\u2014provide for punishment of no more than twelve months in jail and no more than $2,500 as set forth in \u00a7 18.2-11. Code \u00a7 15.1-901, by contrast, purports to limit the punishment imposed for violation of <em>any </em>local ordinance. Under the rule of statutory construction set out above, we conclude that the specific terms of Code \u00a7 15.1-132 apply to give localities the authority to punish driving while under the influence above and beyond the limits set by Code \u00a7 15.1-901.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-5\">Had the City of Norfolk taken no action to increase the penalties provided in its code for DUI offenses, convictions rendered under the local ordinance would have been subject to attack as violative of Code \u00a7 15.1-132. We reached just such a conclusion in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Knott, </em>11 Va. App. 44, 46-47, 396 S.E.2d 148, 149-50 (1990), in which the. local ordinance at issue omitted a penalty enhancement provision present in the corresponding state statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-6\">For the aforementioned reasons, we conclude that Norfolk City Code \u00a7 1-11, as amended by the Norfolk City Council on July 17, 1990, and insofar as it applied to driving while under the influence offenses, was a valid exercise of municipal power under Code \u00a7 15.1-132,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> both at the time of its enactment and the time of appellants\u2019 arrests and convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-7\">Accordingly, the convictions of the appellants are affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-8\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b187-9\">Bray, J., and Willis, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b185-7\"> At this point, the City of Norfolk clearly had the authority to adopt an ordinance providing the same punishment for a Class 1 misdemeanor as provided by general law. Nevertheless the City took no action to readopt Ordinance No. 36.110, effective July 17,1990, which, at that time, violated Virginia Code \u00a7 15.1-901.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b186-7\"> As an example of the legislature\u2019s ability to make its intent clear, Code \u00a7 15.1-2(a) states that \u201cThe repeal of Title 15 . . . shall not affect the powers of any county, city or town with respect to any ordinance, resolution or by-law adopted and not repealed or rescinded prior to such date.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b187-10\"> Appellant does not challenge imposition of the penalties prescribed in Norfolk City Code \u00a7 1-11 to any other offenses. Accordingly, we do not consider whether Code \u00a7 15.1-901 would render Norfolk City Code \u00a7 1-11 void as applied to non-DUI offenses. There is a split of authority among other jurisdictions on this issue, and it appears to be a question of first impression in Virginia. <em>See </em>6 Eugene McQuillin, <em>Municipal Corporations </em>\u00a7 20.66, at 218 nn.14-18 (3d ed. 1988). It is arguable that the ordinance would be valid up to the limits set out in the state statute. <em>See Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Schaeffer, </em>98 Pa. Super. 265, 268 (1929). <em>But see Boyles v. City of Roanoke, </em>179 Va. 484, 487, 19 S.E.2d 662, 663 (1942) (holding void <em>ab initio </em>ordinance proscribing punishment in excess of that authorized in charter).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
