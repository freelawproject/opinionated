He contends that the commission applied an improper standard in determining that his actions constituted willful misconduct. For the reasons that follow, we reverse the order denying benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-8\">1.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-9\">Phipps, who was nineteen years of age, was employed as a utility person for Rann Industries and had been working only thirty days pri- or to the incident at issue. His job required him to carry boxes and clothing between a building that contained Rann\u2019s showroom and Rann\u2019s warehouse building.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-10\">Two days prior to the incident at issue, a ramp outside the rear door of the showroom building was painted with a high gloss paint. The day after the ramp was painted, the ramp became slick because of rain. After an employee, Sandra Shelton, fell on the ramp and injured her back, Sue Hairfield, the warehouse manager and supervisor, assembled all her employees and \u201ctold everyone at this time not to use the ramp, and ... to use the office entrance to exit and to come in until the ramp was dry or we could do something about it, you know, to repair it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b437-11\">Hairfield also instructed Phipps and Thomas Nagle to make signs to put on the door. She instructed them \u201cto make a sign so that people would be very cautious . . . using the ramp.\u201d Phipps\u2019 sign stated, \u201cCaution, Ramp Slick,\u201d and it contained a picture of a woman falling. That sign was placed inside the stockroom on the door leading out to the ramp. Nagle\u2019s sign read, \u201cCaution, Ramp Slick,\u201d and was placed on the outside of the same door.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-12\">The next day Phipps was required to take clothing to the warehouse across the street. Fie used a cart to carry four boxes each weighing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>forty pounds. When he left the showroom building, he went out the back door and slipped on the ramp. As he fell, the hand cart struck him and injured his back.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-5\">The deputy commissioner held that the evidence proved that Phipps was injured because of his own willful misconduct in violation of a safety rule. On review, the commission affirmed the decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-7\">The elements of the defense of willful misconduct are statutorily stated as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b438-8\">No compensation shall be awarded to the employee ... for an injury or death caused by:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b438-9\">1. The employee\u2019s willful misconduct or intentional self-inflicted injury;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b438-10\">* * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b438-11\">5. The employee\u2019s willful breach of any reasonable rule or regulation adopted by the employer and brought, prior to the accident, to the knowledge of the employee. . . .</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b438-12\">Code \u00a7 65.2-306.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-13\">To successfully raise a defense of willful misconduct, the employer must establish (1) \u201cthat the safety rule was reasonable, (2) that the rule was known to [the employee], (3) that the rule was for [the employee\u2019s] benefit, and (4) that [the employee] intentionally undertook the forbidden act.\u201d <em>Spruill v. C.W. Wright Constr. Co., </em>8 Va. App. 330, 334, 381 S.E.2d 359, 360-61 (1989). Proof of negligence will not support the defense.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b438-14\">Willful misconduct requires something more than negligence. \u201c \u2018Willful\u2019 . . . imports something more than a mere exercise of the will in doing the act. It imports a wrongful intention.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b438-16\"><em>Uninsured Employer\u2019s Fund v. Keppel, </em>1 Va. App. 162, 164, 335 S.E.2d 851, 852 (1985) (quoting <em>King </em>v. <em>Empire Collieries Co., </em>148 Va. 585, 590, 139 S.E. 478, 479 (1927)).</p>\n<p id=\"b438-17\">Hairfield\u2019s verbal instructions to the employees is Rann\u2019s basis for asserting the existence of the safety rule and the limits of the safety rule. However, Hairfield\u2019s own testimony demonstrates the ambiguous <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>nature of her instructions. Her testimony concerning those instructions was as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b439-5\">A. On the day that Mrs. Shelton fell. I told everyone at this time not to use the ramp, and that if they \u2014 to use the office entrance to exit and to come in <em>until the ramp was dry </em>or we could do something about it, you know, to repair it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b439-6\">Q. During your meeting with the employees, did you tell them not to ever go in and out the door or did you specify what kind of activities that they could do going in and out of the door.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b439-7\">A. I told them <em>at the time </em>not to use the ramp, to use the office entrance and exit from the office, which was no problem. It was a hall, straight hall, from our warehouse straight down the hall to the outside door of the office (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b439-8\">This evidence proved that the instructions announced by Hairfield only warned the employees not to use the ramp when it was wet. Only by ignoring Hairfield\u2019s testimony could one conclude that the instructions barred employees from using the exit no matter what the weather might have been.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-9\">Even if the commission could have found as a fact that Hairfield announced a clear, unambiguous policy in the meeting with the employees, Hairfield\u2019s testimony proved that she gave Phipps further instructions that countermanded any certainty that may have been conveyed in the meeting. During or immediately following the meeting, Hairfield instructed Phipps and Nagle to make signs for the door. She testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b439-10\">Mr. Phipps made one sign and Mr. Nagle made the other. Mr. Phipps\u2019 sign said, \u201cCaution, Ramp Slick,\u201d and he drew a picture of a lady falling. And, he put this on the inside door and Mr. Nagle made a \u201cCaution, Ramp Slick,\u201d on the outside door so it was covered both ways, in and out.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b439-11\">Hairfield did not instruct Phipps or Nagle to make a sign forbidding the use of the doors to the ramp. The signs, which are the only written manifestation of the instructions that Hairfield announced in the meeting, do not support Rann\u2019s contention that the employees were barred from using the ramp. Moreover, Hairfield\u2019s testimony proved that the signs reflected her instructions.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b440-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>Q. Well, what were your \u2014 to the best of your recollection, what were your specific instructions about the sign?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b440-5\">A. Oh Gee! I don\u2019t know, I don\u2019t really remember, I just told them to make a sign so that people would be very cautious with using the ramp.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b440-6\">This evidence proved that the instructions communicated to Phipps that he should exercise caution when using the ramp. The evidence does not prove that, in making the decision to use the back door to carry the boxes to the warehouse, Phipps was incautious or \u201cintentionally undertook [a] forbidden act.\u201d <em>Spruill, </em>8 Va. App. at 334, 381 S.E.2d at 360-61. On the day following the meeting and the posting of the signs, the weather was drizzly. The evidence also proved that Hairfield agreed that \u201cwhether the ramp was wet or not for anybody would be a judgment call.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b440-7\">When Phipps slipped on the ramp, he had been directed by Nagle, the shipping clerk, to take the clothing to the warehouse. He said that Nagle told him to use the back door and said, \u2018 \u2018just be careful when you go out.\u201d Phipps also testified about a warning Nagle had given him on an earlier occasion regarding entering the main office where the salespeople worked:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b440-8\">I had just got jumped on previously for going through that door, by Thomas Nagle. .He said that. . . nobody [was] supposed to go through there unless they were asked to go through.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b440-9\">The commission cited this testimony and several other instances in which it believed Phipps contradicted other witnesses. We have reviewed those instances and we conclude that the commission misconstrued the testimony. Phipps\u2019 testimony concerning Nagle\u2019s warning was consistent with Sandra Shelton\u2019s testimony that warehouse people were not generally permitted to go through the showroom and office areas. She stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b440-10\">Q. If you needed a load of materials to go out of the warehouse, would it be customary to go through the office?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b440-11\">A. No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b440-12\">Q. And, if you did that, would somebody tell you not to?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b440-13\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b441-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>The commission also stated that Phipps \u201ccontradicted Sandra Shelton\u2019s testimony that she got hurt at break time.\u201d Phipps testified that Shelton slipped during the break. However, Shelton did not contradict that testimony. She testified that \u201cat break time, I went out on the ramp and slipped and fell.\u201d She was later asked:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b441-5\">Q: How long were you gone [to the doctor\u2019s office!?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b441-6\">A: About an hour.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b441-7\">Q: So, you were injured around lunchtime?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b441-8\">A: It was on my break and [Hairfield] had to get me an appointment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b441-10\">Q: What time was that, roughly?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b441-11\">A: I believe it was \u2014 maybe after lunch, and I went to the doctor. I think it took him forty-five minutes. I went right back to work.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b441-13\">Hairfield stated that Shelton fell during lunchtime. Thus, it was Hairfield who gave the conflicting testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-14\">In addition, the commission commented adversely upon Phipps\u2019 testimony that Nagle\u2019s warning influenced him. We believe that the record demonstrates that the commission also misconstrued the import of Phipps\u2019 testimony in that regard. Hairfield testified that she was Phipps\u2019 supervisor. Phipps agreed and identified her as his \u201cimmediate supervisor.\u201d He further testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b441-15\">Q. But, you had only been on this job for thirty days?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b441-16\">A. That\u2019s right, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b441-17\">Q. Now, you indicated that Thomas Nagle is your supervisor?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b441-18\">A. No sir. Sue Hairfield was my supervisor. I worked under Thomas Nagle.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b441-19\">Q. Now, who is Thomas Nagle?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b441-20\">A. He is the owner\u2019s son, the owner of the corporation. He\u2019s his son.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b441-21\">j*c \u00edk ifc</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b442-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>Q. So, this Thomas Nagle was the owner\u2019s son?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AO_\">A. That\u2019s right, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A8t\">Q. I take it he was not a co-worker of yours, in other words, on the same level?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A2tZ\">A. Well, being the boss\u2019s \u2014 I mean, the employer, the main man\u2019s son, I didn\u2019t, you know, look at him as being a co-worker. I looked at him more as being a foreman type person.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b442-9\">This testimony does not contradict Hairfield\u2019s testimony. She testified that she was Phipps\u2019 \u201cboss.\u201d She had told Phipps that if he had no specific assignment, he was to sweep the floor or assist Nagle, if Nagle needed help. Phipps testified that Hairfield was his supervisor but he considered Nagle, the owner\u2019s son, to be \u201ca foreman type person.\u201d His perception that Nagle had authority over him was not without foundation. Not only was Nagle the owner\u2019s son, but he had on occasion given instructions to employees in Hairfield\u2019s absence. Indeed, Hairfield testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b442-10\">Q: And, if stockroom [employees] should finish up a job, does Tom Nagle from time to time, tell other employees what they need to move onto next because he\u2019s more experienced and knows what to do?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b442-11\">A: If I leave instructions for him, yes. If not he comes and calls me. He pages me.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b442-12\">That Nagle, who Phipps perceived to be a foreman, had warned him not to enter the front office where salespeople were dealing with customers sheds light upon Phipps\u2019 state of mind. Phipps was a nineteen year old employee who had been working at the establishment for only thirty days. This evidence tends to prove that Phipps was confronted with the knowledge that he had on previous occasions been warned about going into the showroom, that he was aware that the ramp was slippery and required caution if it was to be used, and that he had been directed to transfer clothing to the warehouse through the back door of the showroom by the very person who had earlier warned him about entering the showroom. At worst, Phipps erred in balancing the directions he had received about the manner in which he was to carry out his duties.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>Significantly, no barrier had been placed in front of the door to deter its use. Likewise, the sign that was placed on the door did not, by its terms, forbid employees from using the door. The signs merely advised cautious use. Thus, the evidence failed to prove that a safety rule barred Phipps from using the ramped exit, and further, the evidence failed to prove that Phipps acted with wrongful intention. \u201cThe claimant did not intentionally or willfully commit an act with knowledge of a known hazard. Negligence, regardless how gross, does not bar a recovery for workers\u2019 compensation benefits.\u201d <em>Uninsured, </em>1 Va. App. at 164-65, 335 S.E.2d at 852.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-5\">Accordingly, we reverse the decision denying Phipps an award.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-6\">\n<em>Reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b443-7\">Elder, J., and Cole, J.,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b443-8\"> Retired Judge Marvin F.
