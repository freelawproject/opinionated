We hold that a finding of connivance, the prior consent of one spouse to the misconduct of another, was sufficiently supported by the evidence. We further hold that the defense of connivance need not be expressly asserted in the pleadings.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-12\">Responding to the wife\u2019s allegation of the husband\u2019s adultery, the husband admitted that he was engaged in an adulterous relationship with another woman before the husband and wife separated. The wife asserted in her cross-bill for divorce that the husband\u2019s adultery began \u201con or about May 24, 1990.\u201d The husband acknowledged that he had lived together with another woman since March 22, 1990, and had had sexual relations with the other woman. The nature of the relationship was corroborated by the testimony of the other woman and the testimony of a private investigator.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-13\">The husband, however, asserted that his wife had urged him to date the other woman and that he had entered into a relationship only after his wife encouraged it. He introduced into evidence a handwritten letter from the wife dated February 4, 1990, which he received before an intimate relationship with the other woman began. The wife wrote that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>she wished to be free from her marriage but was afraid that the husband would \u201cmarry some bimbo.\u201d She wrote that she had seen the husband talking to the other woman at a Christmas party and hoped that the husband would fall in love with the other woman so that the wife could get out of her marriage. She said, \u201cI want so badly for [the husband] to fall in love and share the rest of his life with someone who really loves him; someone like [the other woman], or even [the other woman].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b118-5\">The wife wrote another letter dated February 22, 1990, which she gave to her husband in that month. She titled the letter, \u201cThings I want [the husband and the other woman] to do before the divorce.\u201d In it she said that she wanted her husband and the other woman to \u201crent an apartment and live together for one year as man and wife everyday.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b118-6\">The husband and the other woman testified that they first had sexual relations at the Greenbrier Hotel the third weekend in February, 1990. While there, they received flowers and a card from the wife. The card said, \u201cMy very best wishes to you both today, to your new beginning.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b118-7\">Finally, the husband and wife signed a document dated May 23, 1990, stating that the wife \u201cconsented] to [the husband] moving out of our home.\u201d In it she also said that she was \u201caware that this could entail his moving in and living with another female.\u201d She agreed that she would not \u201cuse this against him as grounds for divorce or punitive action.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b118-8\">The trial court found that the husband\u2019s adultery resulted from the wife\u2019s \u201cconnivance and procurement\u201d and granted the husband a divorce on no-fault grounds. The wife contends that the evidence does not support this finding and that the husband\u2019s failure to plead connivance barred his assertion of it.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-9\">Connivance has been defined as \u201cthe plaintiff\u2019s consent, express or implied, to the misconduct alleged as a ground for divorce.\u201d <em>Greene </em>v. Greene, 15 N.C. App. 314, 316, 190 S.E.2d 258, 260 (1972). Connivance denotes \u201cdirection, influence, personal exertion, or other action with knowledge and belief that such action would produce certain results and which results are produced.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The defense of connivance is based on \u201cthe maxim <em>\u2018'volenti non fit </em>injuria,\u2019 or that one is not legally injured if he has consented to the act complained of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>or was willing that it should occur.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Other courts have similarly defined connivance. <em>McMillan </em>v. <em>McMillan, </em>120 Fla. 209, 214, 162 So. 524, 526 (1935); <em>Atha v. Atha, </em>94 N.J. Eq. 692, 121 A. 301 (1923).</p>\n<p id=\"b119-5\">Condonation, on the other hand, is one spouse\u2019s forgiveness of the other spouse\u2019s adulterous misconduct, usually evidenced by resumption and continuation of apparently normal matrimonial relations. <em>Williams v. Williams, </em>188 Va. 543, 551, 50 S.E.2d 277, 280 (1948); <em>Martin </em>v. <em>Martin, </em>166 Va. 109, 116, 184 S.E. 220, 224 (1936); <em>Cutlip </em>v. <em>Cutlip, </em>8 Va. App. 618, 621, 383 S.E.2d 273, 275 (1989). Knowledge of the misconduct is necessary before condonation may occur. <em>Martin </em>v. <em>Martin, </em>166 Va. at 116, 184 S.E. at 224. Condonation, it follows, may only occur after the occurrence of the misconduct and differs from connivance in when the act of consent or, in the case of connivance, influence occurs. While condonation occurs after the misconduct, connivance occurs before the misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-6\">Connivance is the consent, either expressed or implied, of one spouse to the proposed misconduct of the other spouse. One who consents to another\u2019s misconduct may not seek a divorce based on the misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-7\">The evidence supported the trial court\u2019s finding of the wife\u2019s connivance in the husband\u2019s misconduct. Fler letters and the note accompanying the flowers amply support the finding that she encouraged, as well as consented to, the husband\u2019s adulterous relationship.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-8\">Furthermore, the husband was not barred from asserting this defense because he had not expressly pleaded the defense of connivance or condonation. His answer to the wife\u2019s cross-bill expressly denied her allegations that he had committed adultery that she had not procured or condoned. Furthermore, a court may, as with condonation, \u201cdeny a divorce where it appears from the record that the injured party has\u201d connived to bring about the misconduct complained of. <em>McKee v. McKee, </em>206 Va. 527, 532, 145 S.E.2d 163, 166 (1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b119-9\">For these reasons, we affirm the final decree of divorce.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-10\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b119-11\">Koontz, C.J., and Moon, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
