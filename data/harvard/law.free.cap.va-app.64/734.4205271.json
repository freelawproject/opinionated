On appeal, he contends that the warrantless use of a trained police dog to sniff for illegal drugs outside the door of his motel room on two separate occasions was an unreasonable search that violated his rights under the Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution. We hold that the use of the drug detection dog in this case was not a search on either occasion. Consequently, we affirm the appellant\u2019s convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-6\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b785-7\">In June 2012 and again in September 2012, Newport News police officers received an anonymous tip that a man staying in a particular motel room in the city had drugs in his possession. As part of their investigation on each occasion, officers took a drug detection dog to the motel and directed it to sniff for narcotics outside the room identified by the tipster. In each instance, the officers used the dog\u2019s positive alert as part of the basis for obtaining a search warrant for the room. Each search led to charges against the appellant for possession of marijuana, a second or subsequent offense, in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-250.1, and possession of cocaine, in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-250. Based on the appellant\u2019s actions during the second encounter, he was also charged with assault and battery of two of the officers present at the scene, in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-57(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b785-8\">Prior to trial, the appellant filed a motion to suppress. He contended that each search of his motel room was unconstitutional because the probable cause for each warrant depended, in part, on the fact that a drug detection dog located directly outside his motel room door alerted to odors emanating from the room. He argued that the police needed a warrant prior to conducting the dog sniff. No testimony was offered at the suppression hearing. The court made its ruling after reviewing the affidavits supporting the search warrants, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"740\">*740</page-number>viewing photos of various parts of the motel, and entertaining the arguments of the parties.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b786-5\">One of the affidavits accompanying the June 7 warrant application represented that officers began their investigation based on an anonymous tip that a man staying in Room 236 of a particular motel was in possession of cocaine and a weapon. The tip further indicated that the man had a lot of money and was driving a red or burgundy Thunderbird.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-6\">Photographs of the motel showed the layout of the building. All motel room doors opened to an outside walkway that connected several different rooms located on the same floor. Room 236 was on the second floor of the motel. The walkway outside the second-floor rooms was bordered by a traditional, waist-high metal railing with thin vertical posts. The design of the railing was such that the walkway area and motel room doors and windows were fully visible from the adjacent parking lot.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-7\">Surveillance of Room 236 on June 7 confirmed that a man entered and then exited the room. While officers maintained surveillance on the room, the man drove away in a red Thunderbird. As the man returned to the area of the motel, detectives obtained probable cause to stop the vehicle and did so.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b786-8\">Police identified the driver of the Thunderbird as the appellant and learned he was driving \u201cwith suspended tags\u201d and a suspended license. As an officer prepared a summons for the appellant, another officer, Detective C.L. Brown, walked his drug detection dog, Whiskey, around the Thunderbird. Whis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"741\">*741</page-number>key \u201calert[ed]\u201d to the odor of drugs \u201ccoming from the vehicle.\u201d In a search of the car, police found marijuana residue. Additionally, a key to Room 236 was discovered on the appellant\u2019s person.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-5\">Detective Brown then walked Whiskey \u201caround [several] rooms in the area of [Room 236].\u201d Prior to \u201calert[ing] to room 236,\u201d Whiskey sniffed \u201cthe bottom and side seams of the door jambs,\u201d as well as the exhaust portion of the operating air conditioner that was ventilating the room. The room had been under constant surveillance since the appellant had departed it.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-6\">Based on this information, a third officer applied for and received a warrant that same day to search Room 236. The search yielded illegal drugs, drug paraphernalia, and cash.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-7\">Similar circumstances led to the search of a different room at the same motel about three months later, on September 12. The affidavit supporting the warrant application represented that on that date, police received information that the appellant was occupying and distributing narcotics from the room \u201cimmediately to the left of room 215.\u201d The source also provided information that the appellant had United States currency, marijuana, cocaine, and firearms inside the room. Police confirmed that the appellant\u2019s criminal record contained \u201cextensive history\u201d involving the possession and distribution of illegal drugs and \u201cprevious violations\u201d involving firearms. Police also knew that the information received that day came from \u201cthe same anonymous source\u201d who had provided accurate information about the appellant for the June search warrant.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-8\">Prior to applying for a warrant on September 12, law enforcement confirmed that the appellant was a registered guest in Room 217, which was immediately to the left of Room 215 as the tip had indicated. Room 217, like Room 236, was a second-floor room adjacent to an external walkway that connected numerous rooms on one side and had the same type of open railing on the other side.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-9\">During the course of surveillance, the appellant was seen leaving Room 217. Detective Brown then led Whiskey to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"742\">*742</page-number>conduct \u201ca free air sniff\u2019 outside the room, after which she sniffed \u201cthe bottom and side seams of the door jambs.\u201d Whiskey gave \u201ca positive alert to the presence of the odor of narcotics emanating from inside the room.\u201d When the appellant returned to the room, detectives arrested him. The appellant waived his right to counsel and admitted that he had been smoking marijuana in the room. With this information\u2014 including the partially corroborated tip, the drug dog\u2019s alert, and the appellant\u2019s admission \u2014 police obtained a search warrant for Room 217. The search resulted in the discovery of illegal drugs.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-5\">The circuit court, after reading the warrant applications, viewing the photographs, and hearing argument, denied the motion to suppress. The court ruled that the warrantless use of the drug detection dog outside the motel rooms did not violate the appellant\u2019s reasonable expectation of privacy and, therefore, did not constitute a search. Accordingly, it concluded that the warrants were supported by probable cause and the searches inside the rooms were proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-6\">The appellant entered conditional guilty pleas to the six offenses. He was convicted and sentenced to serve twenty-eight years\u2019 incarceration, with twenty-two years suspended.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-7\">II. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b788-8\">The appellant contends that the warrantless use of a trained narcotics detection dog to sniff for drugs outside the external door of his motel room on two separate occasions was an unreasonable search in light of the ruling of the Supreme Court of the United States in <em>Florida v. Jardines, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 133 S.Ct. 1409, 185 L.Ed.2d 495 (2013). The Commonwealth argues that a dog sniff outside a motel room is not a search for purposes of the Fourth Amendment. We hold that, under <em>Jardines </em>and other precedent, neither of the dog sniffs was a search. Consequently, we affirm the appellant\u2019s convictions.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b789-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"743\">*743</page-number>\n<em>A. Overarching Legal Principles</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b789-4\">On review of the denial of a motion to suppress, the appellant bears the burden of showing that the ruling, \u201c \u2018when the evidence is considered most favorably to the Commonwealth, constituted reversible error.\u2019 \u201d <em>McGee v. Commonwealth, 25 </em>Va.App. 193, 197, 487 S.E.2d 259, 261 (1997) <em>(en </em>banc) (quoting <em>Fore v. Commonwealth, </em>220 Va. 1007, 1010, 265 S.E.2d 729, 731 (1980)).</p>\n<p id=\"b789-5\">The Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution provides \u201c[t]he right of the people to be secure in then-persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures.\u201d U.S. Const. amend. IV. Since the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Katz v. United States, </em>389 U.S. 347, 88 S.Ct. 507, 19 L.Ed.2d 576 (1967), \u201cthe touchstone\u201d of Fourth Amendment analysis has been \u201cthe question whether a person has a \u2018constitutionally protected reasonable expectation of privacy.\u2019 \u201d <em>Oliver v. United States, </em>466 U.S. 170, 177, 104 S.Ct. 1735, 1740\u201441, 80 L.Ed.2d 214 (1984) (quoting <em>Katz, </em>389 U.S. at 360, 88 S.Ct. at 516 (Harlan, J., concurring)), <em>quoted with approval in Rideout v. Commonwealth, </em>62 Va.App. 779, 786, 753 S.E.2d 595, 599 (2014). As the Supreme Court has repeatedly made clear, however, the decision in <em>Katz </em>did not \u201c \u2018snu[f] out\u2019 \u201d the previously recognized protection for property; rather, <em>Katz </em>\u201cestablished that \u2018property rights are not the sole measure of Fourth Amendment violations.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Jones, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, -, 132 S.Ct. 945, 951, 181 L.Ed.2d 911 (2012) (quoting <em>Soldal v. Cook Cnty., </em>506 U.S. 56, 64, 113 S.Ct. 538, 545, 121 L.Ed.2d 450 (1992)) (holding that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"744\">*744</page-number>attaching a GPS device to the bumper of a motor vehicle was a trespass to property and, therefore, an unconstitutional search). In fact, the Court has \u201cembodied that preservation of past rights in [the] very definition of \u2018reasonable expectation of privacy,\u2019 \u201d which is \u201can expectation \u2018that has a source outside of the Fourth Amendment, either by reference to concepts of real or personal property law or to understandings that are recognized and permitted by society.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Minnesota v. Carter, </em>525 U.S. 83, 88, 119 S.Ct. 469, 472, 142 L.Ed.2d 373 (1998)).</p>\n<p id=\"b790-4\">Determining whether particular action by law enforcement constitutes a search for purposes of the Fourth Amendment involves a two-pronged test. First, a defendant must show \u201c \u2018that he personally has an expectation of privacy in the place searched.\u2019 \u201d <em>Rideout, </em>62 Va.App. at 786, 753 S.E.2d at 599 (quoting <em>Carter, </em>525 U.S. at 88, 119 S.Ct. at 472). Second, he must prove that his expectation is objectively \u201creasonable\u201d based on \u201c \u2018a source outside of the Fourth Amendment.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Carter, </em>525 U.S. at 88, 119 S.Ct. at 472) (internal quotation marks omitted). The defendant may establish such a source by reference to either: (1) \u201c \u2018concepts of real or personal property law'\u201d or (2) \u201c \u2018understandings that are recognized and permitted by society.\u2019 \u201d <em>Jones, </em>\u2014 U.S. at -, 132 S.Ct. at 951 (quoting <em>Carter, </em>525 U.S. at 88, 119 S.Ct. at 472).</p>\n<p id=\"b790-7\">We assume without deciding that the appellant manifested a subjective expectation of privacy in the area directly outside his motel rooms. Consequently, the question before us is whether such an expectation was objectively reasonable based on a property interest or other societal norm. This is a legal determination that we review <em>de novo. McCary v. Commonwealth, </em>36 Va.App. 27, 35-36, 548 S.E.2d 239, 243 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b790-8\">\n<em>B. The Holding in Florida v. Jardines</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b790-9\">A classic example of an area in which one has an objectively reasonable expectation of privacy based on concepts of property law is the curtilage of one\u2019s home. <em>See, e.g., </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"745\">*745</page-number><em>Foley v. Commonwealth, </em>63 Va.App. 186, 194-95, 755 S.E.2d 473, 477-78 (2014). It is this property-based concept of privacy rights, analyzed by the Supreme Court in <em>Jardines, </em>upon which the appellant primarily relies.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-4\">In <em>Jardines, </em>the Court considered whether the use of a drug detection dog on the front porch of a private residence was a Fourth Amendment search of that residence, requiring either (1) a warrant or (2) probable cause and exigent circumstances. \u2014 U.S. at -, 133 S.Ct. at 1413-18. In conducting this analysis, the Court highlighted the protections afforded to both the home and \u201cthe area \u2018immediately surrounding and associated with the home,\u2019 \u201d referred to as the curtilage. <em>Id. </em>at -, 133 S.Ct. at 1414 (quoting <em>Oliver, </em>466 U.S. at 180, 104 S.Ct. at 1742). It emphasized:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b791-8\">[W]hen it comes to the Fourth Amendment, the home is first among equals. At the Amendment\u2019s \u201cvery core\u201d stands \u201cthe right of a man to retreat into his own home and there be free from unreasonable governmental intrusion.\u201d This right would be of little practical value if the State\u2019s agents could stand [on] a home\u2019s porch or [in its] side garden and trawl for evidence with impunity; the right to retreat would be significantly diminished if the police could enter a man\u2019s property to observe his repose from just outside the front window.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b791-9\"><em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Silverman v. United States, </em>365 U.S. 505, 511, 81 S.Ct. 679, 683, 5 L.Ed.2d 734 (1961)). The Court noted the \u201cancient and durable roots\u201d of the principle that the curtilage \u201cis \u2018intimately linked to the home, both physically and psychologically,\u2019 and is where \u2018privacy expectations are most heightened.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at ---, 133 S.Ct. at 1414-15 (quoting <em>California v. Ciraolo, </em>476 U.S. 207, 213, 106 S.Ct. 1809, 1812, 90 L.Ed.2d 210 (1986)).</p>\n<p id=\"b791-11\">In contrast to areas qualifying as curtilage, the Court juxtaposed \u201copen fields.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at-, 133 S.Ct. at 1414. It noted that the Fourth Amendment does not \u201cprevent all investigations conducted on private property.\u201d <em>Id. </em>It made clear that private property classified as \u201copen fields\u201d may be searched without a warrant or exigent circumstances because such areas are not considered to be protected by the Fourth <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"746\">*746</page-number>Amendment. <em>Id.; see Johnson v. Commonwealth, </em>26 Va.App. 674, 684, 496 S.E.2d 143, 148 (1998) (noting that an area \u201c \u2018need be neither \u201copen\u201d nor a \u201cfield\u201d as those terms are used in common speech\u2019 \u201d in order to be so classified for Fourth Amendment purposes (quoting <em>Dow Chem. Co. v. United States, </em>476 U.S. 227, 236, 106 S.Ct. 1819, 1825, 90 L.Ed.2d 226 (1986))).</p>\n<p id=\"b792-5\">Based on these principles, the Court recognized in <em>Jardines </em>that the front porch is \u201cthe classic exemplar of an area adjacent to the home and \u2018to which the activity of home life extends.\u2019 \u201d \u2014 U.S. at-, 133 S.Ct. at 1415 (quoting <em>Oliver, </em>466 U.S. at 182 n. 12, 104 S.Ct. at 1743 n. 12). It then proceeded to analyze whether the officers\u2019 investigation in a constitutionally protected area \u201cwas accomplished through an unlicensed physical intrusion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>It noted that despite strict common law rules preventing entry upon the property of another without permission, the \u201c \u2018license ... implied from the habits of [our] country\u2019 ... typically permits [a] visitor to approach [a] home by the front path, knock promptly, wait briefly to be received, and then (absent invitation to linger longer) leave.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>McKee v. Gratz, </em>260 U.S. 127, 136, 43 S.Ct. 16, 17, 67 L.Ed. 167 (1922)). The Court reasoned, therefore, that a police officer, without a warrant, may approach a home and knock on the door because a private citizen may engage in the same behavior. <em>Id. </em>at -, 133 S.Ct. at 1416. However, it concluded that \u201cbackground social norms that invite a visitor to the front door\u201d do not include an \u201cimplied[ ] invit[ation] to enter the protected premises of the home in order to do nothing but conduct a search.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at -&amp; n. 4, 133 S.Ct. at 1416 &amp; n. 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-10\">The Court made clear that it was not overruling its line of cases which hold that \u201ccanine inspection^] of luggage in an airport\u201d or \u201can automobile during a lawful traffic stop[ ] do not violate the \u2018reasonable expectation of privacy\u2019 described in <em>Katz.\u201d Id. </em>at -, 133 S.Ct. at 1417 (citing <em>United States v. Place, </em>462 U.S. 696, 103 S.Ct. 2637, 77 L.Ed.2d 110 (1983); <em>Illinois v. Caballes, </em>543 U.S. 405, 125 S.Ct. 834, 160 L.Ed.2d 842 (2005)). It emphasized that the <em>Katz </em>test, upon which it had relied to validate dog sniffs, \u201c \u2018has been <em>added to, </em>not <em>substituted for,\u2019 </em>the traditional property-based understanding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"747\">*747</page-number>of the Fourth Amendment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Jones, </em>\u2014 U.S. at -, 132 S.Ct. at 952). As a result, the Court explained, it is unnecessary to engage in a broad expectation-of-privacy analysis under <em>Katz </em>when the government has obtained evidence \u201cby physically intruding on [a] constitutionally protected area[ ].\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b793-7\">In <em>Jardines, </em>\u201cthe officers learned what they learned only by physically intruding on [the defendant\u2019s] property to gather evidence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The Court held that this physical intrusion, standing alone, proved an unlawful search. <em>Id. </em>at ---, 133 S.Ct. at 1417-18; <em>see Jones, </em>\u2014 U.S. at ---, 132 S.Ct. at 951-52. It is in the context of this holding that we must determine whether the appellant had an objectively reasonable expectation of privacy that was violated by the presence of the police dog outside his motel room doors.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-11\">\n<em>C. Application of Fourth Amendment Principles</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b793-12\">The appellant alleges that each of the motel rooms, on each of the two days in question, was his home for purposes of the Fourth Amendment.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Accordingly, he contends that he was entitled to the same protections on the external walkway adjacent to the door of each motel room that the defendant in <em>Jardines </em>was entitled to on the front porch of his home. We conclude that settled legal principles dictate a contrary result under an analysis of both property rights and reasonable-expectation-of-privacy principles.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-13\">\n<em>1. Property Interests in Motel Rooms and External Walkways</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b793-14\">The Fourth Amendment protects a person\u2019s home from \u201cunreasonable governmental intrusion.\u201d <em>Alexander v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"748\">*748</page-number><em>Commonwealth, </em>19 Va.App. 671, 673, 454 S.E.2d 39, 40 (1995). Absent probable cause and exigent circumstances, \u201cthe threshold to a person\u2019s home cannot be crossed without a warrant.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 673, 454 S.E.2d at 41 (citing <em>Payton v. New York, </em>445 U.S. 573, 590, 100 S.Ct. 1371, 1382, 63 L.Ed.2d 639 (1980)). The rights of a motel guest are equal to those of the rightful occupants of a home. <em>Servis v. Commonwealth, </em>6 Va.App. 507, 514, 371 S.E.2d 156, 159 (1988) (citing <em>Stoner v. California, </em>376 U.S. 483, 490, 84 S.Ct. 889, 893-94, 11 L.Ed.2d 856 (1964)). As a result, the warrantless entry of one\u2019s home or motel room is \u201cpresumptively unreasonable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>However, the fact that occupants\u2019 rights <em>inside </em>the two types of premises are the same does not mean that their rights <em>outside </em>those premises are necessarily entitled to equivalent Fourth Amendment protections. The decision in <em>Jardines </em>clearly rests on the concept that the area immediately surrounding and associated with a private residence usually qualifies as curtilage, an area entitled under the common law to the same protections as the home itself. However, <em>Jardines </em>does not purport to alter the existing definition of curtilage or extend its holding to the exterior of other types of premises.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-5\">As summarized in the context of the analysis in <em>Jardines, see supra </em>Part II.B., curtilage is \u201chistorically understood to refer to an extension of the home that is so intertwined with the home that the law must provide it the same [Fourth Amendment] protection as the home itself.\u201d <em>Foley, </em>63 Va.App. at 195, 755 S.E.2d at 478 (citing <em>Jardines, </em>\u2014 U.S. at-, 133 S.Ct. at 1414-15). \u201c[T]he boundaries of a home\u2019s curtilage are primarily defined by <em>their relationship with the home ... </em>rather than <em>mere </em>physical proximity or ownership.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 194, 755 S.E.2d at 477 (second emphasis added). The relevant contemporary inquiry is the area\u2019s \u201cconnection to the residence and its role in the lives of its occupants.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 195, 755 S.E.2d at 477. \u201cWhile an area\u2019s use by third parties may be relevant in determining whether the area is in the home\u2019s curtilage, that fact alone does not categorically exclude it.

Dunn, </em>480 U.S. 294, 301, 107 S.Ct. 1134, 1139, 94 L.Ed.2d 326 (1987)). Applying these principles, we conclude that the walkways immediately outside of the appellant\u2019s two different motel rooms did not qualify as curtilage.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-7\">Under the first factor, the walkways at issue were in close proximity to the rooms and provided the only apparent means of ingress and egress. Nevertheless, a single factor of the test is not dispositive, and we must consider the remaining factors in our analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-8\">Under the second factor, the areas at issue were not inside any sort of enclosure indicating an intent to maintain individual privacy. Each second-floor walkway was flanked by a waist-high metal railing with thin vertical posts. This railing was on the opposite side of the walkway from the motel room doors and did not prevent anyone from approaching the doors. Nor did it obstruct the view of the walkway or motel room doors from the adjacent parking lot. Further, no railing bordered the otherwise identical first-floor walkway, reinforcing the inference that the second-floor railing was present for safety rather than privacy purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-9\">In addition, under the third factor \u2014 the nature of the use of the area \u2014 a motel\u2019s registered guest acquires a license to use the motel\u2019s common areas, including the walkways leading to the guest\u2019s room. However, beyond this license for ingress and egress, nothing in the record establishes that the regis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"750\">*750</page-number>tered guest obtained either a property interest in any of the areas outside the rented room or a right to exclude others from those areas. <em>See, e.g., Marullo v. United States, </em>328 F.2d 361, 363 (5th Cir.1964) (holding that unlike the area around one\u2019s home, an occupant of a motel \u201cmust share corridors, sidewalks, yards, and trees with the other occupants\u201d). In fact, a reasonable inference from the record reflects the contrary. The walkway immediately outside each of the appellant\u2019s rooms was necessarily a common area used by the renters, their guests, motel staff, and anyone else on the premises to gain access to the various rooms. Accordingly, any sights, sounds or smells emanating from the rooms might be sensed by others using the walkways.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b796-4\">Finally, under the fourth factor, nothing had been done by the guests to protect the areas from people passing by the motel room doors. The photos of the walkways do not depict any personal items such as plants, lawn furniture, or welcome mats, which might indicate that the areas were deserving of protection through classification as curtilage.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-5\">Consequently, under the <em>Dunn </em>factors adopted in <em>Foley, </em>the area outside each room was not curtilage of the appellant\u2019s temporary dwellings. <em>See </em>Wayne R. LaFave, <em>Search and Seizure </em>\u00a7 2.3(c), at 39 (5th ed. Supp.2014) (noting that the impact of <em>Jardines </em>on Fourth Amendment analysis may be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"751\">*751</page-number>limited to \u201csingle-unit dwellings\u201d because \u201cthe concept of \u2018curtilage\u2019 appears to have little [if] anything to do with multiple-unit structures\u201d).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> As a result, the presence of the drug detection dog on the walkways did not run afoul of <em>Jardines.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b797-5\">\n<em>2. Other Societal Norms Establishing an Objectively Reasonable Expectation of Privacy</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b797-6\">We must next consider whether any other circumstances demonstrate that the appellant had an expectation of privacy that society is prepared to recognize as reasonable outside either of his motel room doors. We hold that the appellant did not have an objectively reasonable expectation of privacy in the walkways directly outside those doors or in the odors detectable by a drug dog while standing on such walkways.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-7\">\n<em>a. Walkways</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b797-8\">Whether an occupant of a motel room has a reasonable expectation of privacy in the external walkways adjacent to it has not been addressed by Virginia\u2019s appellate courts. In <em>Logan v. Commonwealth, </em>47 Va.App. 168, 622 S.E.2d 771 (2005) <em>(en </em>banc), this Court considered an occupant\u2019s privacy interest in the common areas of a rooming house. The Court observed that the Commonwealth had made a factual concession that the rooming house premises were <em>\u201cnot </em>open to the general public,\u201d and it concluded that this concession resolved <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"752\">*752</page-number>the question whether residents had a reasonable expectation of privacy in the relevant areas of the rooming house. 47 Va.App. at 171, 622 S.E.2d at 772-73. In <em>Londono v. Commonwealth, </em>40 Va.App. 377, 397, 579 S.E.2d 641, 650-51 (2003), the Court evaluated the expectation of privacy of the occupant of a sleeping compartment on a train. It held that the occupant had a lower expectation of privacy than in a fixed dwelling and no reasonable expectation that the police would not use the public hallway outside his compartment. <em>Id. </em>Therefore, <em>Londono, </em>like <em>Logan, </em>although instructive, does not resolve the issue currently before the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-5\">Assessing whether a defendant had an objectively reasonable expectation of privacy in a particular location involves an analysis of the totality of the circumstances. <em>See McCary, </em>36 Va.App. at 36, 548 S.E.2d at 243. Factors considered when applying this analysis are much like the considerations that <em>Dunn </em>specifies for assessing whether property is curtilage. <em>See supra </em>Part II.C.1. They include whether the defendant: (1) owned the property, had a possessory interest in it, or was legitimately on the premises; (2) had the right to exclude others from it; (3) demonstrated a subjective expectation of privacy that it would remain free from governmental intrusion; and (4) took normal precautions to maintain his privacy. <em>See McCoy v. Commonwealth, </em>2 Va.App. 309, 311\u201412, 343 S.E.2d 383, 385 (1986); <em>State v. Talley, </em>307 S.W.3d 723, 731, 734 (Tenn.2010). The general rule regarding dwellings such as apartment buildings and motels is that an occupant has no legitimate expectation of privacy in areas subject to common use. <em>See </em>Wayne R. LaFave, <em>Search and Seizure </em>\u00a7 2.3(c), at 758-62 (5th ed.2012). This rule applies to external and internal hallways, even those immediately adjacent to private areas such as individual apartments and motel rooms. Id.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b799-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"753\">*753</page-number>In keeping with the general rule, an assessment of the totality of the circumstances supports the conclusion that the appellant had no objectively reasonable expectation of privacy in the external motel walkways. The walkways belonged to the owner, not the occupants of the individual rooms, and no evidence indicated that the police lacked permission to be present on the walkways. The appellant had a possessory interest in the two rooms themselves, but as to the walkways, his interest, like that of the other motel guests, was one of common, not exclusive, use and access. <em>See United States v. Miravalles, </em>280 F.3d 1328, 1332 (11th Cir.2002) (reasoning that common areas in an apartment building are available for the use of other tenants, visitors of other tenants, the landlord, delivery people, repair workers, and the like). The outside walkway of a motel, unlike a traditional curtilage, frequently must be traversed at all hours by strangers, including guests and hotel staff. Although the appellant had a reasonable expectation of privacy inside the rooms he rented, he had no expectation of privacy in the sights, sounds, and smells detectible without unconstitutional intrusion from outside each room. <em>See infra </em>Part II.C.2.b. <em>&amp; </em>n. 8. Accordingly, the presence of law enforcement officers on the motel walkways was not a search within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-5\">\n<em>b. Drug Detection Dogs and Odors</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b799-6\">We turn to whether the use of a drug detection dog in this location somehow converted the presence of the police into an unlawful search. The law is well established that a canine sniff, standing alone, is not a search for purposes of the Fourth Amendment. The Supreme Court explained in <em>Place, </em>462 U.S. at 707, 103 S.Ct. at 2644-45, that the canine sniff was unique at that time because \u201cno other investigative procedure [was] so limited,\u201d both in the manner of obtaining the information and \u201cin the content ... revealed.\u201d <em>See Wright v. Commonwealth, </em>52 Va.App. 263, 270-71, 663 S.E.2d 108, 112-13 (2008); <em>Alvarez v. Commonwealth, </em>24 Va.App. 768, 775, 485 S.E.2d 646, 649-50 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b800-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"754\">*754</page-number>The Supreme Court reaffirmed these principles more than twenty years later in <em>Caballes, </em>543 U.S. 405, 125 S.Ct. 834, which involved a dog sniff during a traffic stop. The Court recognized that the use of \u201ca well-trained narcotics-detection dog\u201d during a lawful traffic stop \u201cgenerally does not implicate legitimate privacy interests\u201d because such use \u201c \u2018does not expose noncontraband items that otherwise would remain hidden from public view.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 409, 125 S.Ct. at 838 (quoting <em>Place, </em>462 U.S. at 707, 103 S.Ct. at 2644); <em>see Wright, </em>52 Va.App. at 270-71, 663 S.E.2d at 112-13. The Court ultimately concluded that governmental action which reveals only the possession of contraband does not compromise a legitimate privacy interest because any interest in possessing contraband cannot itself be deemed legitimate. <em>Caballes, </em>543 U.S. at 408-09, 125 S.Ct. at 837-38.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b800-5\">Although <em>Place </em>involved a dog sniff of luggage and <em>Caballes </em>involved a similar sniff of a motor vehicle, the Supreme Court\u2019s observations in those cases are equally applicable to the facts here. <em>See Jardines, </em>\u2014 U.S. at \u2014 - \u2014, 133 S.Ct. at 1416-17 &amp; n. 3 (citing <em>Place </em>and <em>Caballes </em>and stating explicitly that \u201c[i]t is not the dog that is the problem\u201d but, rather, the \u201cphysical ] intrusion] on Jardines\u2019 property\u201d); <em>cf. Rodriguez v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, \u2014 - \u2014, 135 S.Ct. 1609, 1614-1615, 191 L.Ed.2d 492, 499-501 (2015) (approving the use of a drug detection dog during a traffic stop as long as the officers either conduct the sniff before the stop has concluded and without prolonging it, or develop independent reasonable suspicion to extend the stop). Key to the Supreme Court\u2019s decisions in those cases was that each law enforcement officer and his trained dog were at a location in which they had a right to be at the time of the sniff and alert. <em>See </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"755\">*755</page-number><em>Fitzgerald v. State, </em>384 Md. 484, 864 A.2d 1006, 1012 (2004) (concluding that the \u201conly relevant locational determination\u201d is whether the dog was \u201cpermitted <em>outside </em>the object sniffed\u201d). Similarly here, and in contrast to <em>Jardines, </em>the police officers and the drug detection dog were at a place in which they had a right to be at the time of each sniff. <em>See supra </em>Part II.C.1. Therefore, consistent with <em>Place </em>and its progeny, the dog sniff here was not a search.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-5\">In addition, the manner in which the police used the drug detection dog exposed her to odors outside rather than inside the motel rooms. As used here, a dog \u201cdoes not detect anything inside a [motel room], but merely detects the particulate odors that have escaped from a [motel room]. In that sense, the odors are no longer \u2018private,\u2019 but instead are intermingled with \u2018the public airspace containing the incriminating odor.\u2019\u201d <em>United States v. Broadway, </em>580 F.Supp.2d 1179, 1191 (D.Colo.2008) (quoting <em>United States v. Morales-Zamora, </em>914 F.2d 200, 205 (10th Cir.1990)), <em>appealed and aff'd on other grounds, </em>358 Fed.Appx. 18 (10th Cir.2009) (unpub\u2019d); <em>see also United States v. Marlar, </em>828 F.Supp. 415, 419 (N.D.Miss.1993) (holding that a trained drug dog, similar to a flashlight, does \u201clittle more than [enhance] the officer\u2019s own senses\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b801-6\">Finally, the use of the trained dog, Whiskey, to detect the odor of illegal drugs outside the motel rooms did not reveal any information other than the likely presence of contraband. See <em>Caballes, </em>543 U.S. at 409-10, 125 S.Ct. at 837-39. Thus, viewed objectively, this use did not violate the appellant\u2019s reasonable expectation of privacy.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b802-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"756\">*756</page-number>III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b802-5\">We hold that the dog sniffs conducted on the common external walkways outside the appellant\u2019s motel room doors were not searches under the Fourth Amendment. Therefore, the search warrants obtained in part as a result of those canine alerts were valid, and the fruits of those searches were admissible in evidence. Accordingly, we affirm the appellant\u2019s convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b786-9\">. In reviewing the denial of a motion to suppress, we view the facts, inferences from those facts, and credibility determinations in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, the party that prevailed below. <em>See, e.g., Malbrough v. Commonwealth, </em>275 Va. 163, 168-69, 655 S.E.2d 1, 3 (2008). In this appeal, with one minor exception, <em>see infra </em>note 4, no dispute exists concerning the facts upon which the ruling on the motion to suppress was based. The issue, instead, concerns the legal significance of those facts.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b786-10\">. The basis for probable cause for the stop is not challenged on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b788-9\">. The Commonwealth argues in the alternative that the good faith exception to the exclusionary rule applies or that any errors were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"743\">*743</page-number>harmless. An appellate court decides cases on the best and narrowest ground. <em>Luginbyhl v. Commonwealth, </em>48 Va.App. 58, 64, 628 S.E.2d 74, 77 (2006) <em>(en </em>banc). We hold that the best and narrowest ground here is our conclusion, which affirms the trial court\u2019s ruling on the same point, that using a drug detection dog outside the appellant's motel room was not a search. <em>See, e.g., Armstead v. Commonwealth, </em>56 Va.App. 569, 575-76 &amp; n. 3, 695 S.E.2d 561, 564 &amp; n. 3 (2010) (holding that the constitutional issue rather than the exclusionary rule claim or procedural bar question was the best and narrowest ground for decision), <em>cited with approval in Abdo v. Commonwealth, </em>64 Va.App. 468, 473 n. 1, 769 S.E.2d 677, 679 n. 1 (2015).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b793-15\">. The appellant argues that he was \u201cactually living\u201d at the motel and, as a result, was entitled to have the area outside the motel rooms either classified as protected curtilage or recognized as an area in which he had an objectively reasonable expectation of privacy. We need not determine what impact the appellant\u2019s residing more permanently in the motel might have on our analysis because the record proves only that the appellant had a key to Room 236 on the day it was searched and was registered in Room 217 three months later, on the day that room was searched. <em>See, e.g., Smith v. Commonwealth, </em>16 Va.App. 630, 635, 432 S.E.2d 2, 6 (1993).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b796-6\">. At trial, the appellant offered photos of \"No Trespassing\u201d signs posted on the motel property. However, no testimony was offered as to the significance of those signs in the context of the appellant's claim. Also, nothing in the record establishes that law enforcement lacked the permission of motel management to be on the property. On appeal, the appellant does not assert that the \"No Trespassing\u201d signs were relevant to an assessment of his Fourth Amendment rights. In fact, he did not include these photos in the appendix, and he made no mention of the signs on brief or in oral argument. Therefore, we do not consider these signs in resolving the appeal. <em>See </em>Rule 5A:20(d), (e); <em>Mason v. Commonwealth, </em>64 Va.App. 599, 610 n. 8, 770 S.E.2d 224, 229 n. 8 (2015); <em>Yap v. Commonwealth, </em>49 Va.App. 622, 629, 643 S.E.2d 523, 526 (2007); <em>see also Jay v.
