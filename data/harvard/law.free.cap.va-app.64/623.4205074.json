Bruce argues that Boardwine is nothing more than a sperm donor under Virginia\u2019s assisted conception statute and that he has no right to custody or visitation. Boardwine responds that the assisted conception statute does not apply and that he established his paternity through DNA testing. We agree with Boardwine and affirm the judgment below.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-9\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"Ahb\">I. The Child\u2019s Conception</p>\n<p id=\"b671-10\">Bruce wanted to conceive a child she could raise on her own, without the involvement of a father. Bruce apparently believed that if she became pregnant in a way that did not involve sexual intercourse, the biological father would not have a claim to any parental rights. To accomplish this goal, Bruce approached Boardwine, a longtime friend, and asked him to be a sperm donor. After some hesitation, Boardwine agreed. Although the parties discussed a written contract regarding any resulting pregnancy, none was ever signed.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-11\">Bruce explained the method she used to try to become pregnant. Boardwine would stop by Bruce\u2019s house. He would go to a separate room. Then, he would give her a plastic container containing his sperm. After a brief conversation, Boardwine would leave. Bruce used an ordinary turkey baster to inseminate herself. No other person was involved. They did not go to a doctor\u2019s office or to a medical facility.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number>When this procedure did not cause Bruce to become pregnant, she turned to a fertility doctor, Dr. Robert Slackman. Dr. Slackman ran some tests, suggested assistance from drugs, and attempted two inseminations with sperm from unknown donors. Neither attempt succeeded, and Bruce again turned to Boardwine.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-4\">In June 2010, Boardwine went to Bruce\u2019s home several times. On these occasions, Bruce did not urge him to sign a contract. She explained that she trusted him and, if it worked, they could \u201ctalk about it some more.\u201d Bruce and Boardwine employed the same insemination procedure they had used previously. On July 7, 2010, she discovered that she was pregnant.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-5\">Bruce and Boardwine have never engaged in sexual relations. They have never lived together, and they do not intend to live together.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-6\">II. Bruce and Boardwine\u2019s Subsequent Relationship</p>\n<p id=\"b672-7\">Initially, Bruce and Boardwine remained on good terms. When Bruce informed Boardwine about the pregnancy, he visited and brought gifts, a stuffed bear and clothes for her and the baby.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-8\">Bruce testified that her expectation was that Boardwine would visit and \u201cbe involved as [her] other friends were involved.\u201d She never anticipated that Boardwine would have the child alone away from her or that he would have formal visitation. She stated that she had no problem with Board-wine \u201chaving some involvement\u201d with the child and the child \u201ceventually knowing\u201d that Boardwine was the biological father. Her desire was to be the child\u2019s sole parent. They did not discuss Boardwine\u2019s role. Bruce never asked Boardwine for financial support. Bruce testified that Boardwine attended one of her sonogram visits but did not participate in her prenatal care.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-9\">Boardwine explained that he intended \u201cto always be involved\u201d with the child. According to Boardwine, the two agreed that Bruce would be the sole parent and that he would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"627\">*627</page-number>be able to see the child as little or as much as he wanted. He stated that he expected to be a part of the child\u2019s life, including attending the child\u2019s sporting activities and being involved in the child\u2019s educational and health decisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-5\">Bruce and Boardwine\u2019s relationship deteriorated around October 2010, when Bruce would not agree to Boardwine\u2019s suggested name for the child. After this argument, they did not speak until shortly after the child\u2019s birth, a period of about five months. Bruce did not inform Boardwine of the birth and did not list Boardwine on the birth certificate. Boardwine, however, learned about the birth and went to the hospital with friends and family. Bruce said that she never asked Board-wine for money or supplies and never asked him to visit or to care for the child. After she returned home from the hospital, Boardwine would come over to her home to visit. She characterized the visits as \u201c[s]ort of strained.\u201d Boardwine was never alone with the child. Eventually, Bruce told Boardwine to \u201c[s]top coming by.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b673-6\">III. The legal proceedings below</p>\n<p id=\"b673-7\">Boardwine initiated proceedings in the Roanoke City Juvenile and Domestic Relations District Court to establish his rights regarding the child, whom we will refer to as J.E. The court ordered the appointment of a guardian <em>ad litem </em>for J.E. By consent of the parties, Boardwine\u2019s petitions were dismissed or withdrawn and, then, appealed to the circuit court. Boardwine sought a finding of his paternity over J.E. as well as joint custody and visitation. Bruce filed a plea in bar and motion to dismiss, arguing, among other things, that Board-wine was merely a sperm donor and had no legal rights to the child. The court ordered a DNA test, which established Boardwine as J.E.\u2019s father. Bruce does not contest that Boardwine is the child\u2019s biological father.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-8\">Following a hearing, the court denied Bruce\u2019s plea in bar and motion to dismiss and granted Boardwine\u2019s petitions. In a detailed memorandum opinion, the court made a number of alternative findings. As relevant here, the court held that the assisted conception statute, Code \u00a7 20-156 <em>et seq., </em>did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"628\">*628</page-number>apply because Bruce\u2019s \u201cpregnancy did not result from \u2018artificial insemination\u2019 or any other \u2018intervening medical technology.\u2019 \u201d The court also found, as a factual matter, that, when Boardwine provided his sperm, the parties intended for him to be J.E.\u2019s legal father. Applying the factors listed in Code \u00a7 20-124.3, the court held that it was in J.E.\u2019s best interests to award Boardwine joint legal and physical custody of J.E. as well as visitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-5\">ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b674-6\">This case presents questions of statutory construction. We review such questions <em>de novo </em>on appeal. <em>L.F. v. Breit, 285 </em>Va. 163, 176, 736 S.E.2d 711, 718 (2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b674-7\">I. The assisted conception statute does not apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-8\">The General Assembly patterned Virginia\u2019s assisted conception statute, Code \u00a7 20-156 <em>et seq., </em>after the Uniform Status of Children of Assisted Conception Act.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The statute defines the child\u2019s father as \u201c[t]he husband of the gestational mother of [the] child.\u201d Code \u00a7 20-158(A)(2). In contrast, a \u201cdonor is not the parent of a child conceived through assisted conception, unless the donor is the husband of the gestational mother.\u201d Code \u00a7 20-158(A)(3). In <em>L.F. v. Breit, </em>the Supreme Court explained that the origin and purpose of the assisted conception statute is to protect the interests of married parents by ensuring that \u201ca married couple could obtain sperm from an outside donor without fear that the donor would claim parental rights.\u201d 285 Va. at 175, 736 S.E.2d at 717. If Boardwine is a \u201cdonor\u201d under this statute, then he is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"629\">*629</page-number>not J.E.\u2019s \u201cparent,\u201d and he would have no statutory right to custody or visitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-4\">The statute defines a \u201cdonor\u201d as \u201can individual, other than a surrogate, who contributes the sperm or egg used in assisted conception.\u201d Code \u00a7 20-156. In turn, Code \u00a7 20-156 defines \u201cassisted conception\u201d as</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b675-5\">a pregnancy resulting from any intervening medical technology, whether in vivo or in vitro, which completely or partially replaces sexual intercourse as the means of conception. Such intervening medical technology includes, but is not limited to, conventional medical and surgical treatment as well as noncoital reproductive technology such as artificial insemination by donor, cryopreservation of gametes and embryos, in vitro fertilization, uterine embryo lavage, embryo transfer, gamete intrafallopian tube transfer, and low tubal ovum transfer.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b675-6\">The phrase \u201cmedical technology\u201d is noteworthy because it does not appear in the Uniform Status of Children of Assisted Conception Act.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b675-7\">Bruce argues that, under a plain meaning of the assisted conception statute, Boardwine is nothing more than a sperm donor and, therefore, he \u201cis not the legal father of the child born of that conception.\u201d Bruce argues that her method of becoming pregnant falls within the statute\u2019s provision for assisted conception through \u201cnoncoital reproductive technology\u201d and, specifically, \u201cartificial insemination by donor.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b675-8\">We construe statutes to \u201c \u2018ascertain and give effect to the intention of the legislature.\u2019 \u201d <em>Rutter v. Oakwood Living Ctrs. of Va., Inc., </em>282 Va. 4, 9, 710 S.E.2d 460, 462 (2011) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"630\">*630</page-number>(quoting <em>Va. Polytechnic Inst. &amp; State Univ. v. Interactive Return Serv., Inc., </em>271 Va. 304, 309, 626 S.E.2d 436, 438 (2006)). Ordinarily, \u201cthis only requires applying the plain meaning of the words used in the statute because the General Assembly\u2019s intent \u2018is usually self-evident from the statutory language.\u2019 \u201d <em>Sheppard v. Junes, </em>287 Va. 397, 403, 756 S.E.2d 409, 411 (2014) (quoting <em>Rutter, </em>282 Va. at 9, 710 S.E.2d at 462).</p>\n<p id=\"b676-4\">The statute\u2019s plain language does not support Bruce\u2019s interpretation. The word \u201cmedical,\u201d in its ordinary use, means \u201cof, relating to, or concerned with physicians or with the practice of medicine\u201d and \u201crequiring or devoted to medical treatment.\u201d <em>Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary </em>1402 (unabr.1981). The statute does not encompass all technology. Instead, its language is limited to \u201cmedical technology.\u201d The plain meaning of the term \u201cmedical technology\u201d does not encompass a kitchen implement such as a turkey baster.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-5\">The examples listed in Code \u00a7 20-156 shed further light on the General Assembly\u2019s intent in crafting this statute. \u201cSuch intervening medical technology,\u201d under the statute,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aq_\">includes, but is not limited to, conventional medical and surgical treatment as well as noncoital reproductive technology such as artificial insemination by donor, cryopreservation of gametes and embryos, in vitro fertilization, uterine embryo lavage, embryo transfer, gamete intrafallopian tube transfer, and low tubal ovum transfer.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b676-6\">Code \u00a7 20-156. The meaning of words in a statute \u201cmay be determined by reference to their association with related words and phrases.\u201d <em>Andrews v. Ring, </em>266 Va. 311, 319, 585 S.E.2d 780, 784 (2003). \u201cWhen general words and specific words are grouped together, the general words are limited and qualified by the specific words and will be construed to embrace only objects similar in nature to those objects identified by the specific words.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Bruce did not become pregnant through \u201cconventional medical and surgical treatment.\u201d Furthermore, the examples of \u201cnoncoital reproductive technology\u201d listed in Code \u00a7 20-156 involve procedures performed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"631\">*631</page-number>with the assistance of medical personnel. An ordinary kitchen implement used at home is simply not analogous to the medical technologies that are listed in Code \u00a7 20-156, nor does it constitute a \u201creproductive\u201d technology under the plain meaning of the term.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-5\">Relying on the plain language of Code \u00a7 20-156, we conclude that the assisted conception statute does not apply to Boardwine.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-6\">II. Bruce established that he is J.E.\u2019s FATHER UNDER CODE \u00a7 20-49.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-7\">There is no serious dispute that Boardwine established that he is the biological father of J.E. Boardwine relied on Code \u00a7 20^19.1(B)(1), which provides that \u201c[t]he parent and child relationship between a child and a man may be established by ... [s]cientifically reliable genetic tests, including blood tests, which affirm at least a ninety-eight percent probability of paternity.\u201d Boardwine\u2019s test established his paternity by a probability greater than 99.999%. The path to fatherhood may have been unconventional, but as the father of J.E., Boardwine was entitled to seek (and as the trial court found, receive), visitation with his son.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b677-8\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b677-9\">We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-10\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b674-9\">. The Uniform Status of Children of Assisted Conception Act was drafted by the National Conference of Commissioners of Uniform State Laws, also known as the Uniform Law Commission.
