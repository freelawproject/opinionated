On appeal, he contends the trial court erred in denying his \u201cmotion <em>in limine </em>related to limiting any reference to prior convictions in another state, for third or subsequent purposes, where the convictions were not substantially similar to the instant charge.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We agree in part and disagree in part. Thus, we reverse Mason\u2019s conviction and remand for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-10\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b649-11\">Mason was charged with possession of cocaine with intent to distribute, third or subsequent offense. Mason made a motion <em>in limine </em>seeking to prevent the Commonwealth from presenting as evidence New York Certificates of Disposition showing three prior convictions: (1) \u201cattempted criminal sale <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>of a controlled substance 3rd degree PL 110-220.39 01\u201d (hereinafter \u201cNY PL \u00a7 220.39(1)\u201d)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> on July 18, 1988; (2) \u201cattempted criminal sale of a controlled substance 5th degree PL 110-220.31 00\u201d (hereinafter \u201cNY PL \u00a7 220.31\u201d), for which he \u201cwas sentenced as a second felony offender\u201d on June 24, 1992; and (3) \u201cattempted criminal sale of a controlled substance 5th degree,\u201d in violation of N.Y. PL \u00a7 220.31 on February 15, 2000.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-5\">The Commonwealth argued that the prior convictions were admissible in its case-in-chief for purposes of proving the prior offenses required for a third or subsequent offense conviction. Mason argued that the convictions were not admissible because the New York statutes were not \u201csubstantially similar\u201d to Code \u00a7 18.2-248. Mason contended that according to this Court\u2019s holdings in <em>Dillsworth v. Commonwealth, </em>62 Va.App. 93, 741 S.E.2d 818 (2013), and <em>Dean v. Commonwealth, </em>61 Va.App. 209, 734 S.E.2d 673 (2012), a crime in another state is not substantially similar to the corresponding crime under Virginia law, for purposes of proving subsequent offense, if the other jurisdiction\u2019s law permits convictions for acts which could not be the basis for a conviction in Virginia law. Further, Mason provided the trial court with an opinion by New York\u2019s highest court, which Mason contended establishes that a person could be convicted under N.Y. PL \u00a7 220.31 and N.Y. PL \u00a7 220.39(1) for conduct that would not be the basis for conviction under Code \u00a7 18.2-248.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-6\">The trial court denied the motion to restrict reference to the convictions. The court noted \u201c[t]he gravamen of the New <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>York offense is substantially similar [to the Virginia code section].\u201d The court reasoned that it didn\u2019t \u201cknow of any two statutes that could be any more substantially similar [because t]hey both make the sale of a controlled substance a felony offense.\u201d Therefore, the court denied the motion and found \u201cthe statute[s] of New York [are] substantially similar to the statute in Virginia.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b651-5\">Consequently, the convictions were admitted during the guilt phase of the trial. The jury found Mason guilty of possession with intent to distribute, third or subsequent offense. Mason filed a post-conviction motion to set aside the jury\u2019s verdict on the basis that the New York statutes were not substantially similar to Code \u00a7 18.2-248 and thus were improperly admitted. The court denied Mason\u2019s motion. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-6\">II. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"AHm\">A. Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b651-7\">\u201cGenerally, \u2018[w]e review a circuit court\u2019s decision to admit or exclude evidence under an abuse of discretion standard and, on appeal, will not disturb [that] decision ... absent a finding of abuse of that discretion.\u2019 \u201d <em>Dean, </em>61 Va.App. at 213, 734 S.E.2d at 675 (quoting <em>Herndon v. Commonwealth, </em>280 Va. 138, 143, 694 S.E.2d 618, 620 (2010)). However, \u201cto the extent admissibility rests upon the interpretation of a statute, that interpretation is a question of law subject to <em>de novo </em>review.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Crawford v. Commonwealth, </em>281 Va. 84, 97, 704 S.E.2d 107, 115 (2011)). Further, \u201cthe determination regarding whether appellant\u2019s [prior] conviction is \u2018substantially similar\u2019 to the offense proscribed by Code \u00a7 [18.2-248] is a question of law, and we review the trial court\u2019s judgment on this question <em>de novo.\u201d Dillsworth, </em>62 Va.App. at 96, 741 S.E.2d at 819.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-8\">B. Code \u00a7 18.2-248</p>\n<p id=\"b651-9\">The Code of Virginia allows for enhanced or mandatory minimum punishments for some offenses upon the defen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>dant\u2019s subsequent conviction(s) of the same or other designated offenses. Many of these provisions include as prior convictions those offenses committed under \u201csubstantially similar\u201d statutes in other states.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Appellate courts in Virginia have analyzed \u201csubstantially similar\u201d in the context of several of these statutes,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> but until now have not addressed what is a substantially similar offense in the context of Code \u00a7 18.2-248.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-5\">\u201c \u2018The proper course [in this case as in all cases of statutory construction] is to search out and follow the true intent of the legislature, and to adopt that sense of the words which harmonizes best with the context, and promotes in the fullest manner the apparent policy and objects of the legislature.\u2019 \u201d <em>Johnson v. Commonwealth, </em>53 Va.App. 608, 611, 674 S.E.2d 541, 542 (2009) (alteration in original) (quoting <em>Colbert v. Commonwealth, </em>47 Va.App. 390, 395-96, 624 S.E.2d 108, 111 (2006)). \u201cThe object of all interpretation and construction of statutes is to ascertain and carry out the intention of the lawmakers, and when the intention is ascertained it must always govern.\u201d <em>Kirkpatrick v. Board of Sup\u2019rs, </em>146 Va. 113, 125, 136 S.E. 186, 190 (1926). The intent of the legislature \u201cis usually self-evident from the statutory language.\u201d <em>Johnson, </em>53 Va.App. at 613, 674 S.E.2d at 543. \u201cFurthermore, it is our <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>\u2018duty ... to interpret the several parts of a statute as a consistent and harmonious whole so as to effectuate the legislative goal.\u2019 Thus, we \u2018will look to the whole body of [a statute] to determine the true intention of each part.\u2019 \u201d <em>Gordon v. Ford Motor Co., </em>53 Va.App. 616, 622, 674 S.E.2d 545, 547-48 (2009) (alterations in original) (quoting <em>Oraee v. Breeding, </em>270 Va. 488, 498, 621 S.E.2d 48, 52 (2005)) (internal citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b653-5\">Code \u00a7 18.2-248(A) provides that \u201cit shall be unlawful for any person to manufacture, sell, give, distribute, or possess with intent to manufacture, sell, give or distribute a controlled substance or an imitation controlled substance.\u201d Subsection (C) of the statute sets out the punishment for \u201cany person who violates this section with respect to a controlled substance classified in Schedule I or II[.]\u201d Therefore, when the Commonwealth seeks to impose the punishment set out in subsection (C), it must show both that the defendant committed conduct prohibited by subsection (A)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>and </em>that the substance involved was classified in Schedule I or II.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-6\">Code \u00a7 18.2-248(C) also provides for mandatory minimum punishment for subsequent offenses in violation of the same subsection. Specifically, as applicable here,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b653-7\">When a person is convicted of a third or subsequent offense under this <em>subsection </em>and it is alleged in the warrant, indictment or information that he has been before convicted of two or more <em>such offenses or of substantially similar offenses in any other jurisdiction which offenses would be felonies if committed in the Commonwealth </em>[a mandatory minimum punishment must be rendered].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b653-8\">Code \u00a7 18.2-248(0 (emphasis added).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The plain language of the statute indicates the legislature intended that \u201csubstantial<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number>ly similar offenses\u201d would be treated the same as qualifying convictions for offenses committed in the Commonwealth. <em>See Johnson, </em>53 Va.App. at 612, 674 S.E.2d at 543 (\u201cWhen interpreting a statute, courts \u2018are required to ascertain and give effect to the intention of the legislature, which is usually self-evident from the statutory language.\u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>Va. Polytechnic Inst. &amp; State Univ. v. Interactive Return Serv., </em>271 Va. 304, 309, 626 S.E.2d 436, 438 (2006))).</p>\n<p id=\"b654-5\">The legislature did not define the phrase \u201csubstantially similar.\u201d However, in the context of determining if another state\u2019s statute is substantially similar to a code section, this Court has previously \u201cestablish[ed] that two things are \u2018substantially similar\u2019 if they have common core characteristics or are largely alike in substance or essentials.\u201d <em>Johnson, </em>53 Va.App. at 613, 674 S.E.2d at 543.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-6\">Thus, our goal is to \u201cfollow the true intent of the legislature,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 611, 674 S.E.2d at 543, by including those convictions from other jurisdictions that the General Assembly has authorized, and no others. Simply put, to be substantially similar, and therefore admissible for the purposes of establishing a third or subsequent offense, the offense from another jurisdiction must be for conduct that would be a violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-248(A) <em>and </em>the substance at issue in the other state\u2019s conviction must be classified in Schedule I or II in Virginia.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-7\">C. Mason\u2019s New York Convictions</p>\n<p id=\"AfH\">It is well established that \u201cthe Commonwealth bears the burden of proving an out of state conviction was obtained under laws substantially similar to those of the Commonwealth. If the Commonwealth shows substantial similarity, the burden shifts to the defendant to produce \u2018evidence of dissimilarity.\u2019 \u201d <em>Dean, </em>61 Va.App. at 214, 734 S.E.2d at 676 (citation omitted) (quoting <em>Rufty v. Commonwealth, </em>221 Va. 836, 839, 275 S.E.2d 584, 586 (1981)). Dissimilarity may be shown, for example, if \u201cunder the Virginia statute, one would not necessarily be found guilty of an offense even though having been found to have committed the same act.\u201d <em>Cox v. Commonwealth, </em>13 Va.App. 328, 330, 411 S.E.2d 444, 446 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"609\">*609</page-number>(1991). In other words, the statutes are not substantially similar \u201cif a person may be convicted of an offense under another jurisdiction\u2019s statute for conduct which might not result in a conviction under [the code section at issue].\u201d <em>Id. </em>In <em>Cox, </em>we reasoned that \u201c[i]f a conviction in another state is based on conduct which is not a violation of [the Virginia Code], then to consider it under [a subsequent offense statute] would, without authority, expand the scope of the convictions which could be considered beyond that which the General Assembly specifically authorized.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b655-5\">1. The Text of the Statutes</p>\n<p id=\"b655-6\">To meet its initial burden of showing that Mason\u2019s New York convictions were for offenses that were substantially similar to the prohibited conduct in Code \u00a7 18.2-248(0, the Commonwealth relied on the plain text of the statutes.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b655-7\">According to N.Y. PL \u00a7 220.31, \u201cA person is guilty of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the fifth degree when he knowingly and unlawfully sells a controlled substance.\u201d Similarly, N.Y. PL \u00a7 220.39(1) provides, in relevant part, \u201cA person is guilty of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree when he knowingly and unlawfully sells: 1. a narcotic drug[.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b655-8\">Code \u00a7 18.2-248(A) states that \u201cit shall be unlawful for any person to manufacture, sell, give, distribute, or possess with intent to manufacture, sell, give or distribute a controlled substance or an imitation controlled substance.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b655-9\">The Commonwealth argued to the trial court that the similarity in language between the New York statutes and Code \u00a7 18.2-248(A) makes the statutes substantially similar. The trial court reasoned that the \u201cgravamen\u201d of the New York statutes was substantially similar to Code \u00a7 18.2-248(A). The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"610\">*610</page-number>court concluded, \u201cClearly, both statutes in this context-I don\u2019t know of any two statutes that could be any more substantially similar [to Code \u00a7 18.2-248(A) ]. They both make the sale of a controlled substance a felony offense.\u201d We agree. Under the facts of this case, the Commonwealth established substantial similarity between Code \u00a7 18.2-248(A) and the New York statutes. Looking at the plain language of the New York statutes and of Code \u00a7 18.2-248(A), it is apparent that they both prohibit the same conduct. Both statutes make it unlawful to sell certain controlled substances. Furthermore, no appellate court in Virginia has construed our statute in a way that would limit the plain meaning of the word \u201csell.\u201d Thus, the New York statutes and Code \u00a7 18.2-248(A) \u201chave common core characteristics or are largely alike in substance or essentials.\u201d <em>Johnson, </em>58 Va.App. at 613, 674 S.E.2d at 543.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-5\">However, that does not end our analysis. For a prior conviction to be admissible for purposes of proving a subsequent conviction under Code \u00a7 18.2-248(C), the plain language of the subsection requires the Commonwealth to show both that the conviction was for a \u201csubstantially similar offense in [the] other jurisdiction\u201d <em>and </em>that the violation was \u201cwith respect to a controlled substance classified in Schedule I or II.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b656-6\">2. New York Penal Law \u00a7 220.31</p>\n<p id=\"b656-7\">The Commonwealth failed to present to the trial court any evidence that the substances involved in Mason\u2019s N.Y. PL \u00a7 220.31 convictions are classified in Schedule I or II in Virginia.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Under New York law, a \u201ccontrolled substance\u201d is defined in N.Y. Public Health \u00a7 3302 as a substance \u201clisted in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"611\">*611</page-number>section thirty-three hundred six of this chapter.\u201d In turn, N.Y. Public Health \u00a7 3306 provides \u201cfive schedules of controlled substances, to be known as schedules I, II, III, IV and V respectively.\u201d Consequently, Mason\u2019s conviction under N.Y. PL \u00a7 220.31 could have been for a controlled substance classified in Schedule III, IV, or V. Likewise, because conviction of some controlled substances are misdemeanors in Virginia, the Commonwealth failed to show that the offense Mason was convicted of under N.Y. PL \u00a7 220.31 would have been a felony in Virginia. Mason\u2019s N.Y. PL \u00a7 220.31 convictions, therefore, could have been \u201cfor conduct which might not result in a conviction under [Code \u00a7 18.2-248(0 ].\u201d <em>Cox, </em>13 Va.App. at 331, 411 S.E.2d at 446. And if Mason\u2019s conviction \u201cis based on conduct which is not a violation of [Code \u00a7 18.2-248(0 ], then to consider it under [that subsection] would, without authority, expand the scope of the convictions which could be considered beyond that which the General Assembly specifically authorized.\u201d Id</p>\n<p id=\"b657-5\">The Commonwealth failed to show that Mason\u2019s convictions under N.Y. PL \u00a7 220.31 were substantially similar offenses under Code \u00a7 18.2-248(0 for purposes of establishing third or subsequent offense. Furthermore, because the certificates of disposition constituted the only evidence of third or subsequent offense, we cannot say that the error was harmless. As a result, the trial court erred in admitting Mason\u2019s N.Y. PL \u00a7 220.31 convictions for purposes of proving predicate convictions under Code \u00a7 18.2-248(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b657-6\">3. New York Penal Law \u00a7 220.39(1)</p>\n<p id=\"b657-7\">Mason\u2019s 1988 conviction is a different matter. That conviction was under N.Y. PL \u00a7 220.39(1), which provides that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"612\">*612</page-number>\u201c[a] person is guilty of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree when he knowingly and unlawfully sells: 1. A narcotic drug[.]\u201d A narcotic drug, in New York, \u201cmeans any controlled substance listed in schedule 1(b), 1(c), 11(b) or 11(c) other than methadone.\u201d NY PL \u00a7 220.00. All the substances listed in these subsections of New York\u2019s Schedules I and II are also listed on Virginia\u2019s Schedules I and II. <em>See </em>N.Y. Public Health \u00a7 3306; Code \u00a7\u00a7 54.1-3446 to -3447. Therefore, although the Commonwealth did not introduce evidence as to the identity of the substance involved in Mason\u2019s N.Y. PL \u00a7 220.39(1) conviction, any substance for which he was convicted under this subsection would necessarily have qualified as a Schedule I or II substance in Virginia. Additionally, a conviction for any substance encompassed by N.Y. PL \u00a7 220.39(1) would necessarily have been a felony if committed in Virginia by virtue of the punishment for an offense involving a Schedule I or II drug set out in Code \u00a7 18.2-248(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b658-5\">The plain language of the statutes establish that N.Y. PL \u00a7 220.39(1) and Code \u00a7 18.2-248(C) are \u201clargely alike in substance\u201d because both statutes make it unlawful to sell a controlled substance. Further, it is apparent from the New York definition of a \u201cnarcotic drug\u201d that the prior convictions under this statute related to a substance classified in Schedule I or II. This showing was sufficient \u201cto carry the Commonwealth\u2019s burden of proving substantial similarity and to shift to the defendant the burden of going forward with evidence of dissimilarity.\u201d <em>Rufty, </em>221 Va. at 839, 275 S.E.2d at 586.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-6\">4. Mason\u2019s Arguments as to Dissimilarity</p>\n<p id=\"b658-7\">Mason contends the New York statutes are <em>not </em>substantially similar to the code section because New York case law establishes that a person can be convicted under the New York statutes without ever possessing the controlled substance, while possession is a required element in Virginia. Mason relies on our analysis in <em>Dean </em>to support his argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"613\">*613</page-number>In <em>Dean </em>this Court reviewed whether the appellant\u2019s two Maryland robbery convictions could be admitted to prove the predicate offenses under an indictment in Virginia for \u201crobbery, a third or subsequent offense, in violation of Code \u00a7\u00a7 18.2-58 [robbery] and 19.2-297.1 [providing enhanced punishment for \u2018any person convicted of two or more separate acts of violence\u2019].\u201d 61 Va.App. at 211, 734 S.E.2d at 674. An act of violence is defined as a violation of any one of nine enumerated statutes, one of which is robbery. Code \u00a7 19.2-297.1(A). Under Code \u00a7 19.2-297.1, prior convictions include \u201cconvictions under the laws of any state or of the United States for any offense substantially similar to those listed under \u2018act of violence.\u2019 \u201d Because \u201cact of violence\u201d is defined as a violation of particular statutes, we were required to compare the Maryland statute with the comparable code section. We concluded that although the wording of the statutes prohibiting robbery is similar, a \u201cdistinct difference exists in the development of the common law in these two states.\u201d <em>Dean, </em>61 Va.App. at 218, 734 S.E.2d at 678. We thus concluded that the two statutes were not substantially similar because the elements of robbery no longer coincide between the two states.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-5\">Based on <em>Dean, </em>Mason argues that <em>People v. Samuels, </em>99 N.Y.2d 20, 750 N.Y.S.2d 828, 780 N.E.2d 513 (2002), from New York\u2019s highest court, renders N.Y. PL \u00a7 220.39(1) dissimilar to Code \u00a7 18.2-248 because it establishes that possession of a controlled substance is not required for conviction of sale of a controlled substance under N.Y. PL \u00a7 220.39(1). In contrast, Mason argues, <em>Jordan v. Commonwealth, </em>273 Va. 639, 643 S.E.2d 166 (2007), establishes that possession is a required element for conviction of possession with intent to distribute under Code \u00a7 18.2-248. Mason contends that these two cases show that a person can be convicted under N.Y. PL \u00a7 220.39(1) for conduct that would not be sufficient for conviction under Code \u00a7 18.2-248. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-6\">Assuming for sake of argument that Mason\u2019s interpretation of <em>Samuels </em>is correct, his conclusion is incorrect. Mason\u2019s argument conflates sale of a controlled substance with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"614\">*614</page-number>possession with intent to distribute.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> In <em>Jordan, </em>the Supreme Court held that possession, either actual or constructive, was a required element of possession with intent to distribute. <em>Id. </em>at 645-46, 643 S.E.2d at 170. The Court, however, said nothing regarding the elements of <em>sale </em>of controlled substance. Code \u00a7 18.2-248 makes it unlawful both to \u201csell\u201d a controlled substance and to \u201cpossess with intent to ... distribute\u201d a controlled substance. These offenses are not the same. <em>See Simon v. Forer, </em>265 Va. 483, 490, 578 S.E.2d 792, 796 (2003) (\u201cWhen the General Assembly uses two different terms in the same act, it is presumed to mean two different things.\u201d (quoting <em>Forst v. Rockingham Poultry Mktg. Coop., Inc., </em>222 Va. 270, 278, 279 S.E.2d 400, 404 (1981))). Mason did not provide, nor could we find, any Virginia case law requiring proof of possession of the drug in order to convict someone for the act of <em>selling </em>a controlled substance in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-248. His argument therefore fails to show the statutes are not substantially similar.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b660-4\">Further, in <em>Dean, </em>we looked to the elements of the offense because Code \u00a7 19.2-297.1 defines prior convictions by refer<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"615\">*615</page-number>ence to several particular statutes. Likewise, in <em>Ayers v. Commonwealth, </em>17 Va.App. 401, 402, 437 S.E.2d 580, 581 (1993), \u201cwe look[ed] to the elements of the two statutes rather than to the offender\u2019s conduct\u201d because the code section at issue, Code \u00a7 46.2-351(3) (repealed 1999), defined predicate offenses as including those from other jurisdictions that \u201csubstantially conform[ed] to the aforesaid state statutory provisions.\u201d In contrast, Code \u00a7 18.2-248(C) defines relevant prior convictions as \u201csubstantially similar offenses\u201d to \u201csuch offenses\u201d \u2014 those where \u201ca person is convicted ... under this subsection.\u201d Therefore, here we need look no further than Code \u00a7 18.2-248(C) and ask if appellant\u2019s conduct would have been the basis for a conviction \u201cunder this subsection.\u201d This includes looking to the facts of the conviction to determine the classification of the substance involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-5\">In this ease, to show that his conviction was dissimilar to Code \u00a7 18.2-248(0, Mason had to show that his N.Y. PL \u00a7 220.39(1) conviction was \u201cfor conduct which might not result in a conviction under [Code \u00a7 18.2-248(0 ].\u201d <em>Cox, </em>13 Va.App. at 331, 411 S.E.2d at 446. This he has not done.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b661-6\">Therefore, we hold that Mason\u2019s conviction under N.Y. PL \u00a7 220.39(1) was admissible for purposes of proving a prior conviction under Code \u00a7 18.2-248(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b661-7\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b661-8\">For the reasons stated above, we hold that Mason\u2019s conviction under N.Y. PL \u00a7 220.39(1) was substantially similar to Code \u00a7 18.2-248 for purposes of establishing one prior conviction. Proof of that conviction was therefore properly admissible, and the trial court did not err in allowing its introduction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number>during the guilt phase of Mason\u2019s trial. Mason\u2019s convictions under N.Y. PL \u00a7 220.31, however, were not substantially similar to Code \u00a7 18.2-248 for purposes of establishing prior convictions because the Commonwealth failed to show that the convictions related to a substance classified in Schedule I or II in Virginia. Thus, those convictions were not relevant for the purpose for which they were offered and were therefore inadmissible. Accordingly, we reverse Mason\u2019s conviction and remand for a new trial, if the Commonwealth be so inclined.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b662-5\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b649-12\">. Mason presented a second assignment of error alleging the trial court erred in denying his \"motion to set aside the jury verdict based on the failure of the Commonwealth to prove that the New [York] convictions were substantially similar to the Virginia statute for third or subsequent purposes.\u201d His argument in support of this assignment of error simply referenced the argument he made supporting the first assignment of error. Accordingly, we consider this to simply reference an additional method by which his first assignment of error was preserved in the trial court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b650-7\">. In Mason\u2019s opening brief, he refers only to the language of N.Y. PL \u00a7 220.39(1). <em>See </em>Appellant's Br. at 6. Likewise, in its brief, the Commonwealth stated that \"Mason was convicted of violating subsection \u201901\u2019 of Penal Law \u00a7 220.39. Subsection 1 of that statute prohibits the sale of a narcotic drug.\u201d <em>See </em>Appellee\u2019s Br. at 20. Adopting the argument presented by both parties, and viewing the facts in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, we conclude that the statute referred to in the order of conviction is N.Y. PL \u00a7 220.39(1). Where the record of appellant\u2019s conviction includes a reference to the specific provision of the other state\u2019s statute he violated, we analyze only that provision in determining substantial similarity. <em>Dillsworth v.

The Commonwealth argues on appeal that it \"proffered to the court that two of the defendant\u2019s New York offenses involved cocaine,\u201d citing page ten of the sentencing transcript. Page ten was not included in the joint appendix. We rely upon the parties to include in the appendix those portions of the trial record that are necessary to decide the appeal. \"By requiring the publication and distribution of an appendix which excludes all irrelevances, the Rules of Court expedite the adjudication of the appeal and reduce the costs.

Moreover, to the extent that the Commonwealth \"proffered\" this evidence during the sentencing hearing, that was far too late, especially in a jury trial, to offer evidence supporting admissibility of the prior convictions.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b660-5\">. We note that Mason assigned error to the convictions \"where the convictions were not substantially similar to the <em>instant charge.\u201d </em>Appellant\u2019s Br. at 3 (emphasis added). This misreads Code \u00a7 18.2-248(C), which allows admission of a conviction for any violation of \"this section [Code \u00a7 18.2-248(A)] with respect to a controlled substance classified in Schedule I or II.\u201d The prior convictions are not limited to convictions for the currently charged prohibited act, here possession with intent to distribute. Instead, the prior conviction is admissible if it is substantially similar to <em>any </em>prohibited act set out in Code \u00a7 18.2-248(A), i.e. to manufacture, sell, distribute <em>or </em>possess with intent to distribute.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b660-6\">. Mason also argues, for the first time on brief, that <em>Jordan </em>establishes that, in Virginia, no presumption of possession arises from the presence of a controlled substance in a vehicle. Mason argues this is contrary to New York law, where \"[t]he presence of a controlled substance in an automobile, other than a public omnibus, is presumptive evidence of knowing possession thereof by each and every person in the automobile at the time such controlled substance was found.\u201d NY PL \u00a7 220.25. To the extent that Mason adequately preserved this argument, we reject it. This New York statute applies to <em>knowing possession, </em>but Mason has not shown, and indeed argues to the contrary, that possession is a required element for sale of a controlled substance in New York.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b661-9\">. Mason also argues that New York's schedules of controlled substances contain substances that are not in Virginia\u2019s schedules. Assuming without deciding that Mason is correct, the presence of such substances on New York\u2019s schedules is irrelevant in light of our analysis. The substance at issue in the prior conviction has to be classified as a Schedule I or II in Virginia to be substantially similar for purposes of Code \u00a7 18.2-248(C).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b662-15\">. Mason does not challenge the sufficiency of the evidence to support the third offense conviction. Thus, we are not called upon to address whether the evidence was sufficient to support the subsequent offense conviction, and, if not, whether the conviction for that offense must be dismissed. <em>See Rushing v. Commonwealth, </em>284 Va. 270, 278, 726 S.E.2d 333, 339 (2012) (holding \"an appellate court may <em>not </em>consider evidence illegally admitted at trial\u201d when reviewing the sufficiency of the evidence (quoting <em>Crawford, </em>281 Va. at 111-12, 704 S.E.2d at 123-24)). However, we note Code \u00a7 19.2-324.1, enacted after <em>Rushing, </em>requires an appellate court to remand the case for retrial if it concludes that, absent the erroneously admitted evidence, the evidence as a whole was insufficient and that the error was not harmless.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
