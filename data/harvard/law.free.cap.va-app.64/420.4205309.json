(\u201cWHA\u201d), Angela C. Bess, M.D. (\u201cDr. Bess\u201d), and Loudoun Hospital Center d/b/a Inova Loudoun Hospital, Alysia M. Warfield, R.N., and Azam Dabirzadeh, R.N. (\u201cInova\u201d), (collectively \u201cappellants\u201d) appeal the decision of the Virginia Workers\u2019 Compensation Commission (the \u201ccommission\u201d) transferring Valerie Mucci\u2019s (\u201cMucci\u201d) personal injury claims to the Circuit Court of Loudoun County (the \u201ccircuit court\u201d). The commission affirmed the deputy commissioner\u2019s finding that Mucci\u2019s claimed injuries were separate and distinct from her infant son\u2019s neurological injury, and thus did not fall under the exclusive remedy of the Virginia Birth-Related Neurological Injury Compensation Act of 1987 (the \u201cAct\u201d). For the following reasons, this Court affirms the commission\u2019s decision to transfer Mucci\u2019s personal injury claims to the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-8\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b470-9\">Enacted by the General Assembly in 1987, the Act provides claimants with a no-fault remedy for compensation for qualified injuries. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 38.2-5002. The Act also affords potential tort defendants (at least those who choose to participate in the Birth-Related Neurological Injury Compensation Fund under Code \u00a7 38.2-5015) with an absolute immunity to civil malpractice liability for these injuries. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 38.2-5002(B). By delivering an infant in a participating hospital and/or through a participating physician, the infant\u2019s family <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>automatically waives the right to bring a medical malpractice lawsuit against the participating physician or hospital if the infant incurs a birth injury that meets the definition in the Code. <em>Wolfe v. Va. Birth-Related Neurological Injury Comp. Program, </em>40 Va.App. 565, 584, 580 S.E.2d 467, 476 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b471-4\">Mucci went to Loudoun Hospital Center on February 22, 2006 for a scheduled labor induction. Mucci was approximately forty weeks pregnant and was considered \u201cpostdate.\u201d Cervidil was placed to ripen Mucci\u2019s cervix followed by a Pitocin infusion to initiate uterine contractions. Mucci was monitored by Dr. Bess and other healthcare providers at Inova throughout the labor process. As labor progressed, the monitoring machines began to show signs of fetal distress, including decelerations in the fetal heart rate. As a result, Dr. Bess attempted a vacuum extraction delivery, which proved unsuccessful. Dr. Bess then performed a cesarean section to deliver Mucci\u2019s infant son at 6:56 p.m. on February 23, 2006. Mucci\u2019s son was born with neurological injuries, which all parties agree qualify as birth-related neurological injuries under the Act. The commission admitted Mucci\u2019s son into the Virginia Birth-Related Injury Compensation Program (the \u201cProgram\u201d) on May 1, 2012.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-5\">In addition to her son\u2019s injuries, Mucci claims that she suffered injuries during the course of the labor and delivery of her son. In her complaint and subsequent bill of particulars in the circuit court, Mucci stated that her uterine tissue was injured as a result of Dr. Bess\u2019s failure to \u201cperform the cesarean section that was indicated\u201d and by her decision to \u201ccontinue Pitocin induction for an extended period of time instead of discontinuing it.\u201d Mucci also claimed that these medical decisions also caused uterine hyperstimulation and prolonged labor and resulted in worry and anxiety for Mucci\u2019s own well-being. Inova filed a motion to refer the matter to the commission pursuant to the Act, which the circuit court granted on May 25, 2010.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-6\">In a February 16, 2011 pleading to the commission, Mucci further explained that her claim was for \u201cphysical injuries to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>herself \u2014 a damaged uterus, physical pain, and permanent scarring and disfigurement of her uterus, which occurred during the course of labor and delivery\u201d and emotional distress \u201crelated to the permanent injury of her uterus and the surrounding tissues, rather than emotional distress related to the injuries to her son.\u201d On the morning of the April 10, 2012 evidentiary hearing to determine jurisdiction of Mucci\u2019s claims, the parties exchanged expert designations. Appellants objected to the deputy commissioner\u2019s consideration of Mucci\u2019s expert opinions, arguing that the opinions were materially distinct from the claims pled in Mucci\u2019s complaint and bill of particulars in the circuit court. Mucci presented two expert reports from Dr. Richard Stokes and Dr. Douglas R. Phillips.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-4\">According to Dr. Stokes, Mucci experienced \u201cprolonged hyperstimulation and tetanic contractions\u201d which \u201ccaused increased stretching of the lower uterine segment and disruption of connective tissue resulting in damage to the uterine tissue.\u201d Dr. Stokes concluded that Mucci suffered \u201csevere pain and suffering, as well as substantial concern for her own medical well-being\u201d as a result of the prolonged hyperstimulation and tetanic contractions. Dr. Phillips\u2019s report summarized Mucci\u2019s injuries:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b472-5\">Ms. Mucci suffered injury to her uterine tissue, endured many hours of tetanic contractions, and ultimately had to undergo an emergency cesarean section delivery which resulted in permanent disfigurement and scarring to her uterus. The prolonged hyperstimulation resulted in uterine hypoperfusion and tissue damage and caused Ms. Mucci to suffer significant pain and suffering. Furthermore, Ms. Mucci became a high risk patient for subsequent pregnancies and required that she undergo a repeat cesarean section procedure for the delivery of her second child on February 19, 2009 at George Washington University Hospital.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b472-6\">Appellants relied on the expert opinion of Dr. Norman Armstrong, who stated that Mucci\u2019s medical records indicate that Mucci\u2019s cesarean section in 2006 was \u201ca direct result of the nonreassuring fetal heart rate and signs of fetal distress. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>The C-section was unrelated to the mother\u2019s individual status at the time. It was performed in a standard manner and its sequelae was typical of any C-section.\u201d Ultimately, the deputy commissioner overruled appellants\u2019 objection, allowing Mucci\u2019s expert reports to the extent they addressed whether Mucci\u2019s injuries were derivative of the infant\u2019s injuries. The deputy commissioner found that Mucci\u2019s claimed injuries were separate and distinct from her son\u2019s neurological injuries and therefore were not limited to the exclusive remedy provision of Code \u00a7 38.2-5002(B). The commission affirmed this ruling on May 29, 2014, and transferred Mucci\u2019s claims to the circuit court for resolution in that forum.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-4\">II. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b473-5\">A. The Consideration of Expert Reports for Determining Jurisdiction</p>\n<p id=\"b473-6\">\n<em>Standard of Review</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b473-7\">In their first assignment of error, appellants challenge the commission\u2019s finding that Mucci could offer expert opinions as part of her petition under Code \u00a7 8.01-273.1. Pursuant to Code \u00a7 8.01-273.1(B), the party seeking referral must provide the commission with \u201cappropriate assessments, evaluations, and prognoses and such other records obtained during discovery and are reasonably necessary for the determination of whether the infant has suffered a birth-related injury. The medical records and the pleading referenced in this subsection shall constitute a petition as referenced in \u00a7 38.2-5004.\u201d Because this assignment of error poses a question of law, the Court reviews the commission\u2019s decision <em>de novo. NiSource, Inc. v. Thomas, </em>53 Va.App. 692, 711, 674 S.E.2d 581, 591 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b473-8\">Appellants collectively claim that the commission erred in considering Mucci\u2019s two expert reports arguing that the petition is comprised only of the initial and responsive pleadings of the parties and medical records. Specifically, appellants argue that the commission erred in allowing Mucci to substitute new allegations in her expert reports that were not previously <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>raised in her complaint or bill of particulars in the circuit court.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b474-4\">Even without considering the expert reports, the commission found that \u201c[t]here is ample information in the record transferred to the commission regarding the alleged injuries for which Valerie Mucci seeks a remedy.\u201d When there is evidence to support the commission\u2019s findings, they will not be disturbed on appeal, even though there may be evidence in the record to support a contrary finding. <em>Caskey v. Dan River Mills, Inc., 225 </em>Va. 405, 411, 302 S.E.2d 507, 510-11 (1983). Even when the deputy commissioner considered only the documents appellants rely on, the commissioner still arrived at the same conclusion \u2014 that Mucci\u2019s alleged injuries are non-derivative of her son\u2019s injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-5\">Notably, appellants, not Mucci, referred this case to the commission. In interpreting Code \u00a7 38.2-5001, the commission has found that healthcare providers cannot be a claimant under this statute because they cannot represent the interests of the infant. <em>In re: Subham Patel, </em>No. B-09-05, 10 WC UNP B0905 (Va. Workers\u2019 Comp. Comm\u2019n Nov. 22, 2010). This conclusion is \u201cconsistent with the language in \u00a7 38.2-5004(B) and (C) which says \u2018upon receipt of the petition or the filing of a claim.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at *11 (emphasis added). Because Mucci\u2019s claims were transferred to the commission by appellants, Mucci did not file a complaint before the commission. Instead, appellants, who sought referral to the commission pursuant to the Act, filed a petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-6\">Code \u00a7 8.01-273.1(B) mandates that the party seeking referral provide the commission with \u201cappropriate assessments, evaluations, and prognoses and such other records obtained during discovery and are reasonably necessary for the determination of whether the infant has suffered a birth-related injury. The medical records and the pleading referenced in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>this subsection shall constitute a petition as referenced in \u00a7 38.2-5004.\u201d Therefore, the \u201cpetition\u201d includes all medical records and expert reports that can be characterized as assessments, evaluations, prognoses, and records that can be obtained during discovery. Appellants argue that Mucci\u2019s expert reports do not meet the definition of a \u201cpetition,\u201d because the expert reports relate to Mucci\u2019s injuries and not her infant son\u2019s. However, appellants are unable to point to any statutory language or case law that supports the proposition that the deputy commissioner is limited to considering only the \u201cpetition\u201d to make a jurisdictional determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-4\">The General Assembly has authorized the commission \u201cto hear and pass upon all claims filed pursuant to this [Act]. The [c]ommission may exercise the power and authority granted to it in Chapter 2 of Title 65.2 as necessary to carry out the purposes of this chapter.\u201d Code \u00a7 38.2-5003. The commission has concluded that the purpose of the Act is to \u201cimplement a social policy of providing compensation to families whose neonates suffer birth-related neurological injuries.\u201d <em>Va. Birth-Related Neurological Injury Comp. Program v. Young, </em>34 Va.App. 306, 311-12, 541 S.E.2d 298, 301 (2001). Consistent with this purpose, the commission has been granted broad discretion in reviewing all claims brought under the Act. There is no statutory language that limits the commission\u2019s authority to consider the entire record when making a jurisdictional determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-5\">Finally, the commission\u2019s consideration of the entire record is consistent with the less rigid, informal nature of the pleading requirements of the commission. \u201cPleading requirements in administrative proceedings before the Industrial Commission are traditionally more informal than judicial proceedings ... rigid or technical rules of pleading, evidence, or practice in the conduct of hearings shall not apply so long as the procedures adopted protect the substantial rights of the parties.\u201d <em>Sergio\u2019s Pizza v. Soncini, </em>1 Va.App. 370, 376, 339 S.E.2d 204, 207 (1986) (internal citations omitted). Thus, the commission did not err in considering other documents in the record when making its determination of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>B. Issues Regarding Sufficiency of Notice</p>\n<p id=\"b476-4\">Appellants also claim that the commission erred in finding that issues regarding sufficiency of notice of Mucci\u2019s claim are matters to be resolved by the circuit court upon remand.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> While appellants argue that Mucci\u2019s theory of negligence expressed in her complaint and bill of particulars was different than the theories advanced by her two experts in their reports, this distinction was never relevant to the commission\u2019s inquiry. Because the Program created by the Act was designed as a \u201cno-fault\u201d system of compensation, decisions regarding acceptance into the Program are not based on a finding of negligence. <em>Cooper v. Adler, </em>44 Va.App. 268, 276, 604 S.E.2d 747, 751 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b476-5\">The commission\u2019s task was never to assess whether any of the appellants were negligent with regard to Mucci\u2019s injuries. Instead, the commission\u2019s sole task was to determine if Mucci\u2019s injuries were \u201cseparate and distinct\u201d from her son\u2019s neurological injuries within the meaning of the Act. The deputy commissioner acknowledged this limited inquiry, stating, \u201cI\u2019m going to allow the expert reports only to the extent that they address the nature of the injury and whether or not they\u2019re probative in my determination of whether the injury is derivative.\u201d The fact that the expert reports expressed a different theory of negligence than stated in the circuit court pleadings had no relevance to the commission\u2019s determination of whether Mucci\u2019s injuries were separate and distinct from her infant\u2019s injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-6\">Furthermore, appellants were on notice of Mucci\u2019s specific allegations of injury. It is clear from the medical records and bill of particulars that Mucci seeks damages for her alleged permanent disfigurement and damage to her uterus, and pain <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>and worry about her own well-being. Mucci\u2019s February 16, 2011 pleading to the commission (submitted more than a year before the evidentiary hearing), further explained that her claim is for \u201cphysical injuries to herself \u2014 a damaged uterus, physical pain, and permanent scarring and disfigurement of her uterus, which occurred during the course of labor and delivery\u201d and emotional distress \u201crelated to the permanent injury of her uterus and the surrounding tissues, rather than emotional distress related to the injuries to her son.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b477-4\">Appellants were provided with every opportunity to conduct discovery prior to the evidentiary hearing that the parties, themselves, requested. \u201cAny party ... upon application to the commission setting forth the materiality of the information requested, serve interrogatories or cause the depositions of witnesses residing within or without the Commonwealth to be taken....\u201d Code \u00a7 38.2-5007. Noting the appellants\u2019 failure to conduct discovery, the commissioner stated at the evidentiary hearing,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b477-5\">The [cjommission has discovery rules, we allow discovery, nobody has written asking me for any discovery. The parties were certainly welcome to take any depositions they wanted to take ... to propound interrogatories, request for production of documents. I mean all of that has been free and available to everyone. So I don\u2019t feel that there\u2019s any surprise here today.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b477-6\">Additionally, any variance in the theory of negligence alleged in the complaint and expert reports was not relevant to the commission\u2019s jurisdictional determination. Proving such theories would be a necessary requirement for Mucci to prove in circuit court, not before the commission. Therefore, the commission did not err in finding that any issues of proof or notice are best left to the circuit court upon remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-7\">C. Mucci\u2019s Separate and Distinct Injury Claims</p>\n<p id=\"AH\">\n<em>Standard of Review</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b477-8\">Appellants further argue that the commission erred in its application of the facts of the present ease to the law set forth in the Act. As a result, this alleged error is a mixed question <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>of fact and law and is therefore reviewed <em>de novo. Young v. Va. Birth-Related Neurological Injury Comp. Program, </em>46 Va.App. 558, 569, 620 S.E.2d 131, 137 (2005). Appellants\u2019 third, fourth, fifth, sixth, and seventh assignments of error claim the commission erred in interpreting Code \u00a7 38.2-5002(B). The statute specifically states,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b478-4\">[T]he rights and remedies herein granted to an infant on account of a birth-related neurological injury shall exclude all other rights and remedies of such infant, his personal representative, parents, dependents or next of kin, at common law or otherwise <em>arising out of </em>or related to a medical malpractice claim with respect to such injury to the infant, including any claims by the infant\u2019s personal representative, parents, dependents or next of kin that, by substantive law, are derivative of the medical malpractice claim with respect to the infant\u2019s injury, including but not limited to claims of emotional distress proximately related to the infant\u2019s injury. This subsection shall not be construed to exclude other rights and remedies available to the infant\u2019s mother arising out of or related to a physical injury, <em>separate and distinct </em>from an injury to the infant that is suffered by the infant\u2019s mother <em>during the course of </em>the infant\u2019s delivery.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b478-5\">Code \u00a7 38.2-5002(B) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b478-6\">When construing a statute, \u201c \u2018[cjourts are not permitted to rewrite statutes. This is a legislative function. The manifest intention of the legislature, clearly disclosed by its language, must be applied. There can be no departure from the words used where the intention is clear.\u2019 \u201d <em>Barr v. Town &amp; Country Props., Inc., </em>240 Va. 292, 295, 396 S.E.2d 672, 674 (1990) (quoting <em>Anderson v. Commonwealth, </em>182 Va. 560, 566, 29 S.E.2d 838, 841 (1944)). Courts must also assume that the legislature chose, with care, the words it used when it enacted the relevant statute, and are bound by those words when interpreting the statute. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b478-7\">1. Statutory Interpretation of \u201carising out of,\u201d \u201cderivative,\u201d and \u201cseparate and distinct\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b478-8\">Appellants have advanced three specific assignments of error to the commission\u2019s interpretation of Code \u00a7 38.2-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>5002(B) as it relates to whether a mother\u2019s injury claim is separate and distinct from the infant\u2019s injury. First, appellants claim that the commission erred in finding that Mucci\u2019s alleged injuries are \u201cseparate and distinct\u201d from the child\u2019s neurological injuries.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Appellants also assert that the commission erred in finding that Mucci\u2019s claim does not \u201carise out of\u2019 or relate to a medical malpractice claim with respect to the infant, or is not \u201cderivative of\u2019 the medical malpractice claim with respect to the infant\u2019s injury.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Finally, appellants argue that uncontroverted evidence shows that the timing of and the decision to perform a cesarean section were dictated solely by the needs of the infant, and therefore any injuries to Mucci\u2019s uterus occurred as a direct result.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b479-4\">The statute makes clear, \u201cThis subsection shall not be construed to exclude other rights and remedies available to the infant\u2019s mother arising out of or related to a physical injury, separate and distinct from an injury to the infant that is suffered by the infant\u2019s mother during the course of the infant\u2019s delivery.\u201d Code \u00a7 38.2-5002(B). The preceding sentence of the code section expressly states that the remedies granted to the infant shall exclude all other rights and remedies that may be available to other parties with respect to the infant\u2019s injury \u201carising out of or related to a medical malpractice claim with respect to such injury to the infant ... that ... are derivative to the medical malpractice claim with respect to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>the infant\u2019s injury.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Read together, it follows that the \u201cseparate and distinct\u201d claims of an injured child\u2019s mother that are not subject to the exclusive remedy of the Act, are distinct from the \u201cderivative claims\u201d \u201carising out of\u2019 a claim of injury to the infant, which are encompassed by the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-4\">Appellants mistakenly argue that the correct inquiry under the Act is whether the claim of the parent arises out of or is related to the infant\u2019s medical malpractice claim. The term \u201cmedical malpractice claim\u201d is qualified with the phrase \u201cwith respect to such injury to the infant.\u201d Code \u00a7 38.2-5002(B). Therefore, the medical malpractice claim must be causally related to the injury of the infant. This interpretation is consistent with this Court\u2019s previous holding that the phrase \u201carising out of\u2019 implicates a causation requirement and has been construed as referring to the \u201corigin or cause of the injury.\u201d <em>Cooper, </em>44 Va.App. at 278, 604 S.E.2d at 752 (citing <em>Bradshaw v. Aronovitch, </em>170 Va. 329, 335, 196 S.E. 684, 686 (1938)). Thus, this Court must consider the origin of Mucci\u2019s injury rather than merely the origin of Mucci\u2019s medical malpractice claim as appellants suggest. The Virginia Supreme Court has considered the meaning of a derivative claim, holding it to be a claim \u201chaving no origin in itself, but one owing its existence to a preceding claim.\u201d <em>Mahony v. Becker, </em>246 Va. 209, 212, 435 S.E.2d 139, 141 (1993) (citing <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>443 (6th ed.1990)).</p>\n<p id=\"b480-5\">In analyzing whether a mother\u2019s injury was separate and distinct from her infant\u2019s injury, this Court rejected a mother\u2019s claim for emotional distress stemming from her child\u2019s neurological injuries reasoning, \u201cbut for the injury to the child, appellant would have no claim of emotional distress.\u201d <em>Cooper, </em>44 Va.App. at 279, 604 S.E.2d at 752. In that case, this Court found that the mother\u2019s injuries \u201cflowed naturally from and was incidental to the birth-related neurological injury to her child.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In other words, the mother\u2019s claim was derivative of her child\u2019s injury claim and only existed because her child was born with neurological injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>Conversely, Mucci\u2019s claim for injuries to her uterine tissue and emotional stress relating to those injuries did not occur \u201cbut for\u201d the birth-related neurological injury to her son. These claimed injuries could have also occurred with the delivery of an otherwise healthy child. The commission found that the \u201cinjuries [Ms. Mucci] allegedly sustained were not caused by the loss of oxygen to [her infant son\u2019s] brain but rather by the induction of labor and subsequent cesarean section. Her injuries did not flow naturally and incidentally from those her child suffered.\u201d It is clear from the face of the statute that injuries sustained by a mother that are not incidental to the child\u2019s neurological injuries are not governed by the Act. The record is clear that Mucci\u2019s claims are for separate injuries relating to her uterine tissue.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-4\">2. Statutory Interpretation of \u201cduring the course of delivery\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b481-5\">Appellants\u2019 sixth assignment of error alleges that the commission incorrectly interpreted the injury timing restrictions of Code \u00a7 38.2-5002(B), an issue of first impression for this Court. Specifically, appellants argue that the commission erred in concluding that Mucci\u2019s alleged injuries sustained during labor, and not delivery, are beyond the commission\u2019s jurisdiction.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b481-6\">Words in a statute are to be construed according to their ordinary meaning, given the context in which they are used. <em>Grant v. Commonwealth, </em>223 Va. 680, 684, 292 S.E.2d 348, 350 (1982). \u201cWhere the legislature has used words of a plain and definite import the courts cannot put upon them a construction which amounts to holding the legislature did not mean what it has actually expressed.\u201d <em>Watkins v. Hall, </em>161 Va. 924, 930, 172 S.E. 445, 447 (1934). The term \u201cdelivery\u201d is defined as \u201cthe procedure of delivering the fetus and placenta by manual, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>instrumental, or surgical means.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <em>Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary </em>597 (3d ed.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b482-4\">Appellants limit the statutory language by focusing solely on the term \u201cdelivery\u201d to conclude that Mucci\u2019s injury claims are encompassed by the Act. Yet, the plain language of the statute is, \u201cduring the course of the infant\u2019s delivery.\u201d Code \u00a7 38.2-5002(B). Adopting appellants\u2019 proposed interpretation of this statutory language to mean only the birth of a child, would render the phrase, \u201cduring the course of\u2019 completely meaningless. If the General Assembly intended to limit the statutory exclusion to a mother\u2019s injuries only occurring at the precise moment of delivery, the statute could have been easily written as \u201cat delivery\u201d or \u201cat birth.\u201d Nonetheless, the legislature specifically included the phrase \u201cduring the course of,\u201d which is consistent with a more expansive inclusion of time, place, and circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-5\">Virginia jurisprudence is clear that, \u201cwhere the question involves an interpretation which is within the specialized competence of the agency and the agency has been entrusted with wide discretion by the General Assembly, the agency\u2019s decision is entitled to special weight in the courts.\u201d <em>Johnston-Willis, Ltd. v. Kenley, </em>6 Va.App. 231, 244, 369 S.E.2d 1, 8 (1988).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b482-6\">The rationale of the statutory scheme is that the [administrative agency] shall apply expert discretion to matters coming within its cognizance, and judicial interference is permissible only for relief against the arbitrary or capricious action that constitutes a clear abuse of the delegated discretion. The reviewing judicial authority may not exercise anew the jurisdiction of the administrative agency and merely substitute its own independent judgment for that of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>the body entrusted by the Legislature with the administrative function.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b483-4\"><em>Va. Alcoholic Beverage Control Comm\u2019n v. York St. Inn, Inc., </em>220 Va. 310, 315, 257 S.E.2d 851, 855 (1979).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b483-5\">The commission has exclusive jurisdiction to decide whether an infant\u2019s claim lies within the purview of the Act.Code \u00a7 38.2-5003. The legislature entrusted the commission with broad discretion in interpreting and enforcing the Act. In this role, the commission has consistently held that the key inquiry in determining whether a mother\u2019s claim is barred depends on whether it arises out of, or relates solely to the infant\u2019s injury, not whether the mother\u2019s injury occurred at any particular time during the labor and delivery process. <em>See In re: Robert Chad Lowery, </em>File No. B-04-09, 05 WC UNP B0409 (Va. Workers\u2019 Comp. Comm\u2019n Apr. 29, 2005); <em>see also In re: Nina Scott, </em>File No. B-07-05, 07 WC UNP B0705 (Va. Workers\u2019 Comp. Comm\u2019n Nov. 20, 2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b483-6\">As applied to Code \u00a7 38.2-5002(B), this Court affirms the commission\u2019s determination that limiting the interpretation of the language \u201cduring the course of delivery\u201d to only the moment of the infant\u2019s birth would create an inconsistency with the definition of \u201cbirth related neurological injury,\u201d which can occur during labor, delivery, and resuscitation. This Court appropriately defers to the commission\u2019s consistent interpretation of the Act and its medical terms such as \u201cduring the course of delivery.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b483-7\">3. Commission\u2019s Finding Regarding Mucci\u2019s Remedy</p>\n<p id=\"b483-8\">In their final assignment of error, appellants claim that the commission erred by basing its ruling that it lacks jurisdiction over Mucci\u2019s claims on \u201cthe fact that applying the Act to Ms. Mucci\u2019s personal injury claim would give her no remedy even <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>if she proves her case.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Appellants misstate the commission\u2019s holding. The commission, in interpreting the purpose of the Act, correctly reasoned that the General Assembly did not intend to deprive a mother of a remedy for her own separate physical injuries simply because those injuries, like her child\u2019s neurological injuries, may have also been attributed to medical malpractice. This statement is consistent with the commission\u2019s finding, \u201cwe do not believe that the [Gjeneral [Assembly intended to offer blanket immunity for all physical injuries, including those of the mother.\u201d <em>Lowery, </em>05 WC UNP B0409, at *7. Instead, the Act makes it explicitly clear that non-derivative injuries to the mother are exceptions to the exclusive remedy provision of the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-4\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b484-5\">Finding that the commission did not err in concluding that Mucci\u2019s claims were separate and distinct from her infant son\u2019s neurological injuries and thus, were not subject to the exclusive remedy of the Act, we affirm the commission\u2019s finding and decision to transfer Mucci\u2019s personal injury claims to the circuit court for resolution.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b474-7\">. <em>Assignment of Error </em># <em>1: </em>\"The [Commission erred when it found that Ms. Mucci could raise, and the [c]ommission could consider, new allegations regarding the nature, scope and/or cause of Ms. Mucci's alleged injuries that were not set forth in the Complaint or Bill of Particulars.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b476-7\">. <em>Assignment of Error </em># <em>2: </em>\u201cThe [cjommission erred when it ruled that the issues regarding the sufficiency of notice of Ms. Mucci\u2019s claim, as provided in the Complaint and Bill of Particulars, are 'matters of procedure and proof, which are issues to be resolved by the circuit court upon remand,\u2019 and not matters to be resolved by the [cjommission prior to, and for the purpose of, determining jurisdiction.\u2019\u2019</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b479-5\">. <em>Assignment of Error </em># <em>3: </em>\"The [c]ommission erred when it interpreted and applied Code Section 38.2-5002(33) in such a manner as to conclude that Ms. Mucci\u2019s alleged injuries are separate and distinct from the infant\u2019s neurological injury.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b479-6\">. <em>Assignment of Error </em># <em>4: </em>\"The [cjommission erred when it ruled that Ms. Mucci's claim does not arise out of or relate to a medical malpractice claim with respect to the infant, or is not derivative of the medical malpractice claim with respect to the infant\u2019s injury, pursuant to Code Section 38.2-5002(33).\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b479-7\">. <em>Assignment of Error </em>#5: \"The [cjommission erred when it failed to consider the uncontroverted evidence that the fact of and timing of the cesarean section were dictated solely by the medical needs and condition of the infant, and any alleged injury to Ms. Mucci's uterine tissue occurred as a direct, natural result.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b481-7\">. <em>Assignment of Error </em># <em>6: </em>\"The [Commission erred when it interpreted and applied Code Section 38.2-5002(B) in such matter as to conclude that Ms. Mucci's alleged injuries sustained during labor, and not delivery, are beyond the [Commission's jurisdiction.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b482-7\">. <em>Webster's Third New International Dictionary </em>597 (3d ed.1993), also defines \"delivery\u201d as \"the expulsion or extraction of a fetus and its membranes.\u201d \"Delivery\u201d is also defined as \"giving birth to a child, together with the placenta and membranes, by a parturient woman.\u201d <em>Taber\u2019s Cyclopedic Medical Dictionary </em>640 (22d ed.2013).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b483-9\">.
