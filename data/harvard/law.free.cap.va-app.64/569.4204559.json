The circuit court reversed VMRC\u2019s decision to revoke the licenses and fishing privileges of Darrell Insley (\u201cInsley\u201d) and Dennis Parker (\u201cParker\u201d), and remanded the case back to VMRC to reinstate Insley\u2019s and Parker\u2019s licenses and privileges. VMRC\u2019s single assignment of error is that the circuit court erred by setting aside VMRC\u2019s decision because it was supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-6\">Parker and Insley (collectively \u201cappellees\u201d) submit a cross assignment of error asserting that the circuit court erred in failing to award them attorney\u2019s fees because they substantially prevailed below and VMRC\u2019s position was not substantially justified.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-7\">\n<em>I. Background</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b618-8\">Parker and Insley were issued several summonses by VMRC for violating state fishing laws.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> They were both convicted on all charges in general district court. Neither Parker nor Insley appealed any of their convictions. On March 24, 2014, VMRC held a hearing to consider whether to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>revoke Parker\u2019s and Insley\u2019s fishing licenses and privileges pursuant to Code \u00a7 28.2-232 because of their recent convictions. At the hearing, VMRC heard evidence of Parker\u2019s four convictions stemming from two separate incidents, and Insley\u2019s three convictions stemming from three separate incidents. Parker and Insley each were given an opportunity to present evidence and argument, but neither disputed that they were in fact convicted of those violations. VMRC unanimously decided to revoke their fishing licenses and privileges for one year \u2014 beginning March 25, 2014 and ending March 25, 2015.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-4\">Parker and Insley appealed the VMRC\u2019s decision to the circuit court. On August 22, 2014, the circuit court reversed the VMRC\u2019s decision, holding that it did not \u201cthink the evidence here substantially supports the action that the VMRC took\u201d and that \u201cthe action is too draconian given the nature of the violations.\u201d Concluding that the evidence did not support a finding that Parker\u2019s or Insley\u2019s convictions rose to a \u201ccourse of conduct,\u201d the circuit court found that the evidence therefore did not support a finding that the licenses and privileges ought to have been revoked. On September 8, 2014, the circuit court entered two orders setting aside VMRC\u2019s decision and remanding the matter back to VMRC to reinstate Parker\u2019s and Insley\u2019s licenses and privileges.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-5\">\n<em>II. Analysis</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b619-6\">The Virginia Administrative Process Act (\u201cVAPA\u201d) authorizes judicial review of agency decisions. Code \u00a7 2.2-4026. Specifically, \u201cunder the VAPA, the circuit court\u2019s role in an appeal from an agency decision is equivalent to an appellate court\u2019s role in an appeal from a trial court.\u201d <em>Sch. Bd. of Cnty. of York v. Nicely, </em>12 Va.App. 1051, 1062, 408 S.E.2d 545, 551 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b619-7\">Code \u00a7 2.2-4027 provides that \u201c[t]he duty of the court with respect to the issues of law shall be to review the agency decision de novo.\u201d However, \u201c[w]hen the decision on review is to be made on the agency record, the duty of the court with respect to issues of fact shall be to determine whether there <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>was substantial evidence in the agency record to support the agency decision.\u201d Code \u00a7 2.2-4027. This Court has held that \u201cthe phrase \u2018substantial evidence\u2019 refers to \u2018such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind <em>might </em>accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u2019 \u201d <em>Hedleston v. Va. Retirement Sys., </em>62 Va.App. 592, 599, 751 S.E.2d 1, 4 (2013) (emphasis added) (quoting <em>Va. Real Estate Comm\u2019n v. Bias, </em>226 Va. 264, 269, 308 S.E.2d 123, 125 (1983)). \u201c \u2018[I]n the context of factual issues, the reviewing court shall take due account of the presumption of official regularity, the experience and specialized competence of the agency, and the purposes of the basic law under which the agency has acted.\u2019 \u201d <em>Doe v. Va. Bd. of Dentistry, </em>52 Va.App. 166, 175, 662 S.E.2d 99, 103 (2008) (en banc) (quoting <em>Johnston-Willis, Ltd. v. Kenley, </em>6 Va.App. 231, 242, 369 S.E.2d 1, 7 (1988)). \u201cThe reviewing court may reject the agency\u2019s findings of fact only if, considering the record as a whole, a reasonable mind would necessarily come to a different conclusion.\u201d <em>Johnston-Willis, Ltd., </em>6 Va.App. at 242, 369 S.E.2d at 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-4\">\n<em>A. There Was Substantial Evidence in the Record to Support VMRC\u2019s Decision</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b620-5\">Code \u00a7 28.2-232 provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b620-6\">[VMRC] may revoke the fishing privileges within the Commonwealth\u2019s tidal waters and revoke, prohibit the issuance, reissuance, or renewal of any licenses if, after a hearing held after 10 days\u2019 notice to the applicant or licensee, it finds that the person has violated any provision of this subtitle.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b620-7\">The duration of the revocation and prohibition shall be fixed by [VMRC] up to a maximum of two years with the withdrawal of all fishing privileges conferred by this title during that period, taking into account (i) evidence of repeated or habitual disregard for conservation, health and safety laws and regulations; (ii) abusive conduct and behavior toward officers; and (iii) the severity of any damage that has occurred, or might have occurred, to the natural resources, the public health, or the seafood industry.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b621-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>In other words, all that Code \u00a7 28.2-232 requires for VMRC to revoke a person\u2019s fishing license and privileges is a finding that \u201cthe person has violated any provision of this subtitle.\u201d The second paragraph of the statute relates only to VMRC\u2019s decision regarding the appropriate <em>duration </em>of the revocation period. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b621-4\">In this case, there plainly was substantial evidence in the record to support VMRC\u2019s finding that both Parker and Insley had violated a provision within the \u201cTidal Fisheries\u201d subtitle \u2014 specifically, Code \u00a7 28.2-201; Code \u00a7 28.2-530; Code \u00a7 28.2-515; or Code \u00a7 28.2-517. Evidence of their convictions was presented to VMRC at the hearing. Neither Parker nor Insley disputed that they had been convicted. As explained above, the circuit court \u201cmay reject the agency\u2019s findings of fact <em>only if, </em>considering the record as a whole, <em>a reasonable mind would necessarily come to a different conclusion.\u201d Johnston-Willis, Ltd., </em>6 Va.App. at 242, 369 S.E.2d at 7 (emphasis added). Here, there is no support for the proposition that a reasonable mind would come to a conclusion other than that Parker and Insley had violated one of the provisions of the subtitle. Consequently, the circuit court erred in finding that VMRC\u2019s decision to revoke Parker\u2019s and Insley\u2019s fishing licenses and privileges was not supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-5\">The second paragraph of Code \u00a7 28.2-232 dictates which factors VMRC must consider in determining the appropriate <em>duration </em>of any revocation of fishing licenses or privileges and sets the statutory maximum revocation period. However, \u201c[a] statutory command to consider certain decision making factors does not mean the factfinder must assign \u2018measurable weight in the decisional process\u2019 to each factor or somehow quantify its impact on the final decision.\u201d <em>Campbell v. Dep\u2019t of Forestry, </em>46 Va.App. 91, 103, 616 S.E.2d 33, 38-39 (2005) (quoting <em>Owens v. Owens, </em>41 Va.App. 844, 860, 589 S.E.2d 488, 496 (2003)). \u201cIt means merely the factfinder \u2018cannot deem legally insignificant\u2019 what the statute \u2018declares to be significant.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 103, 616 S.E.2d at 39 (quoting <em>Owens, </em>41 Va.App. at 860, 589 S.E.2d at 496). An opposite principle <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number>applies when a statute requires a specific finding as a <em>precondition </em>to agency action. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b622-4\">Code \u00a7 28.2-232 does not require that VMRC must affirmatively find evidence of any of the factors listed as a precondition to revoke an individual\u2019s fishing license and privileges. The precondition to VMRC\u2019s action to revoking licenses and fishing privileges is listed in the first paragraph of Code \u00a7 28.2-232 \u2014 a finding that a person has \u201cviolated any provision\u201d within the subtitle. Moreover, Code \u00a7 28.2-232 also does not require that VMRC must affirmatively find evidence of one or any of the factors listed in fixing the duration of any revocation period. All that is required in fixing the duration of the revocation period is that VMRC must consider evidence of those factors in making its determination and cannot exclude any of the factors as insignificant. <em>See, e.g., Owens, </em>41 Va.App. at 859-60, 589 S.E.2d at 496 (holding that Code \u00a7 20-107.3(E) required the trial court only to <em>consider </em>the enumerated statutory factors in fixing an equitable distribution award, and the court was only prohibited from failing to consider a factor altogether). Therefore, as long as VMRC considered the three factors listed in the statute in fixing the duration of the revocation period, VMRC\u2019s actions were not beyond its statutory discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-5\">In this case, the circuit court held that it did not \u201cthink the evidence here substantially supports the action that the VMRC took\u201d and that \u201cthe action is too draconian given the nature of the violations.\u201d The circuit court held that as to factor (i) the term repeatedly \u201cmeans again and again,\u201d and \u201cin legal terms, it means a course of conduct.\u201d Concluding that the evidence did not support a finding that Parker\u2019s or Insley\u2019s convictions rose to a \u201ccourse of conduct,\u201d the circuit court held that the evidence did not support a finding that the licenses ought to have been revoked. However, the circuit court erred by ordering the reinstatement of appellees\u2019 fishing licenses and privileges because, as explained above, substantial evidence supported VMRC\u2019s finding that they had violated a provision of the subtitle given their undisputed convictions in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>general district court. Furthermore, the circuit court\u2019s observation that it thought the sanction \u201ctoo draconian\u201d was not an appropriate consideration in its review of the commission\u2019s judgment. Because the presumption of regularity is not rebutted by the evidence in the record and because there is affirmative evidence in the record that VMRC <em>considered </em>all three factors in fixing the duration of their punishment, the circuit court erred in finding that the sanction imposed by the VMRC was not substantially supported by the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-4\">Moreover, appellees\u2019 revocation period did not exceed the statutory maximum of two years. Absent extraordinary circumstances not present in this record, reviewing courts will not judicially supersede an agency\u2019s decision to impose a penalty within the statutory limits. <em>See Campbell, </em>46 Va.App. at 102, 616 S.E.2d at 38.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b623-5\">In sum, we hold that the circuit court erred in finding that there was not substantial evidence in the record to support VMRC\u2019s decision to revoke Parker\u2019s and Insley\u2019s fishing licenses and privileges for the period of one year.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-6\">\n<em>B. VMRC Did Not Retroactively Apply Code \u00a7 28.2-232 to Insley</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b623-7\">Effective July 1, 2013, Code \u00a7 28.2-232 was amended to additionally allow VMRC to revoke \u201cfishing privileges within the Commonwealth\u201d as well as revoke fishing licenses. Insley argues that because VMRC\u2019s March 24, 2014 decision to revoke his fishing privileges and license pursuant to Code \u00a7 28.2-232 was based in part on a conviction that occurred before the July 1, 2013 effective date of the amendment \u2014 his February 20, 2013 violation \u2014 VMRC erred by \u201cretroactively\u201d applying the amendment to Insley.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>The United States Constitution and the Virginia Constitution prohibit the Commonwealth from enacting <em>ex post facto </em>laws. That prohibition only extends to statutes that retroactively impose penalties or where a change in the law retroactively alters the definition of the penal conduct. <em>See Kitze v. Commonwealth, </em>23 Va.App. 213, 216, 475 S.E.2d 830, 832 (1996). \u201c[T]he <em>ex post facto </em>inquiry focuses on \u2018the quantum of punishment attached to the crime\u2019 of which the defendant had notice at the time of the offense.\u201d <em>Evans v. Commonwealth, </em>228 Va. 468, 476-77, 323 S.E.2d 114, 118 (1984) (quoting <em>Dobbert v. Florida, </em>432 U.S. 282, 294, 97 S.Ct. 2290, 2298, 53 L.Ed.2d 344 (1977)). \u201c \u2018Critical to relief under the <em>Ex Post Facto </em>Clause is not an individual\u2019s right to less punishment, but the lack of fair notice and governmental restraint when the legislature increases punishment beyond what was prescribed when the crime was consummated.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Weaver v. Graham, </em>450 U.S. 24, 30, 101 S.Ct. 960, 965, 67 L.Ed.2d 17 (1981)).</p>\n<p id=\"b624-4\">Assuming without deciding that a statute whose purpose is to revoke an individual\u2019s fishing license and privileges is sufficiently penal in nature to trigger the application of the <em>Ex Post Facto </em>Clause, Insley\u2019s argument still fails. <em>See Smith v. Doe, </em>538 U.S. 84, 92, 123 S.Ct. 1140, 1146-47, 155 L.Ed.2d 164 (2003) (holding that in an <em>ex post facto </em>inquiry, the Court must first \u201cascertain whether the legislature meant the statute to establish \u2018civil\u2019 proceedings,\u201d but \u201c[i]f the intention of the legislature was to impose punishment, that ends the inquiry\u201d and <em>ex post facto </em>concerns are applicable; \u201c[i]f however, the intention was to enact a regulatory scheme that is civil and nonpunitive, we must further examine whether the statutory scheme is so punitive either in purpose or effect as to negate [the State\u2019s] intention to deem it civil\u201d (citations omitted)). In this case, no <em>ex post facto </em>concerns are implicated because Insley\u2019s license and fishing privileges were revoked pursuant to Code \u00a7 28.2-232 based on conduct that occurred <em>after </em>the amendments. He had two violations of the subtitle that occurred <em>after </em>the amendments on September 4, 2013 and December 2, 2013. Accordingly, Insley was being <em>punished </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>for conduct that occurred after the change in the statute and he was therefore on notice of the potential \u201cquantum of punishment\u201d attached to the violation at the time it occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-4\">In fixing the <em>duration </em>of the revocation period, VMRC was statutorily required to take into consideration \u201cevidence of repeated or habitual disregard for conservation, health and safety laws and regulations.\u201d Insle/s pre-amendment conduct, the February 20, 2013 violation, was only considered in determining the appropriate length of his penalty. That conduct was illegal at the time it occurred. Consideration of violations of other fishing laws that occurred before the amendments to Code \u00a7 28.2-232 but were still illegal at the time of the offender\u2019s conduct do not raise any more <em>ex post facto </em>concerns when considered only for fixing the duration of the penalty than the consideration of a prior criminal record would in sentencing in a criminal case. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Rodriquez, </em>553 U.S. 377, 386, 128 S.Ct. 1783, 1789, 170 L.Ed.2d 719 (2008) (\u201cWhen a defendant is given a higher sentence under a recidivism statute \u2014 or for that matter, when a sentencing judge, under a guidelines regime or a discretionary sentencing system, increases a sentence based on the defendant\u2019s criminal history \u2014 100% of the punishment is for the offense of conviction. None is for the prior convictions or the defendant\u2019s \u2018status as a recidivist.\u2019 The sentence \u2018is a stiffened penalty for the latest crime, which is considered to be an aggravated offense because [it is] a repetitive one.\u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>Gryger v. Burke, </em>334 U.S. 728, 732, 68 S.Ct. 1256, 1258, 92 L.Ed. 1683 (1948))).</p>\n<p id=\"b625-5\">In sum, because VMRC\u2019s decision to revoke Insley\u2019s fishing license and privileges pursuant to Code \u00a7 28.2-232 was based on a violation of the subtitle that occurred after the amendments became effective, VMRC did not retroactively apply Code \u00a7 28.2-232 to Insley.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-6\">\n<em>C. The Circuit Court Did Not Err in Denying an Award of Attorney\u2019s Fees</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b625-7\">Parker and Insley assign cross-error asserting that the circuit court erred by failed to award them attorney\u2019s fees. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>Specifically, they argue that an award of attorney\u2019s fees was mandatory under the law because they substantially prevailed and VMRC\u2019s position was not substantially justified. For the reasons explained above, VMRC\u2019s position is not only substantially justified, but also adequately supported by the law and the facts. Therefore, we hold that the circuit court did not err in declining to award Parker and Insley attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-4\">\n<em>III. Conclusion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b626-5\">For the reasons stated above, we reverse the circuit court\u2019s September 8, 2014 judgment and order in part. We affirm that portion of the judgment and orders of the circuit court denying attorney\u2019s fees to Parker and Insley and remand these cases to the circuit court and direct that it enter orders consistent with our decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-6\">\n<em>Affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b618-9\">. On February 20, 2013, Insley was issued a summons charging him with possession of unculled oysters in violation of Code \u00a7 28.2-201. On September 4, 2013, he was issued a summons charging him with commercially taking oysters by dredge between sunset and sunrise in violation of Code \u00a7 28.2-530. On December 2, 2013 he was issued a summons charging him with another violation of Code \u00a7 28.2-201. On September 4, 2013, Parker was issued a summons charging him with three separate violations: (1) commercially taking oysters by dredge between sunset and sunrise in violation of Code \u00a7 28.2-530; (2) dredging on private oyster ground without the permit to dredge on the ground in violation of Code \u00a7 28.2-515; and (3) failure to properly mark oyster ground lease and boat before commercially working in violation of Code \u00a7 28.2-517.

Parker and Insley base a large portion of their argument on the fact that the penalty imposed was inconsistent with VMRC's recommended penalty guidelines. However, as the Commonwealth points out, these guidelines are not mandatory and do not carry with them the force of the law. Such documents are not intended to be a substitute for the statute.
