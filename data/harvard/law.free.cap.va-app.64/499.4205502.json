Samartino (\u201cSamartino\u201d) appeals the decision of the Virginia Workers\u2019 Compensation Commission finding that he did not prove total or partial disability resulting from leukemia entitling him to benefits pursuant to Code \u00a7 65.2-402(C). In this case, the parties do not disagree that Samartino was a firefighter who had been diagnosed with an occupational disease. The only dispute was whether he was <em>disabled </em>as a result of his disease.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-11\">\n<em>I. Background</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b548-12\">This Court must view the evidence in the light most favorable to the prevailing party before the commission. <em>See </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number><em>Crisp v. Brown's Tysons Corner Dodge, Inc., </em>1 Va.App. 503, 504, 339 S.E.2d 916, 916 (1986). As such, the evidence viewed in the light most favorable to Fairfax County Fire and Rescue (\u201cthe employer\u201d) is as follows.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-4\">On August 28, 2013, Samartino filed a claim for benefits alleging an occupational disease, leukemia, that arose out of and in the course of his employment. Pursuant to Code \u00a7 65.2-402(0 he sought temporary total disability benefits for September 11, 2012, September 13, 2012, September 15-19, 2012, October 3, 2012, October 18, 2012, October 19, 2012, October 30, 2012, December 10, 2012, and March 3, 2013, as well as a lifetime award for medical expenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-5\">During the November 21, 2013 hearing before the deputy commissioner, the parties stipulated that at the time of the hearing Samartino was employed as a firefighter for more than twelve years by Fairfax County Fire and Rescue and his weekly salary was $1,404.97. They also stipulated that Samartino was diagnosed with chronic lymphocytic leukemia on September 18, 2012.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-6\">Samartino testified that during the course of his seventeen years of employment as a first responder, he was exposed to fire, smoke, and diesel fumes. In the fall of 2012, he began to feel ill. Samartino explained that the days that he missed work were either because he was not feeling well from the symptoms of his illness or was attending medical appointments related to his treatment. In general, if Samartino needed to leave for a medical appointment, he recorded his time as sick leave.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-7\">On September 11, 2012, Samartino took sick leave for twelve hours of his twenty-four-hour shift to attend a doctor\u2019s appointment with oncologist Dr. John P. Williams. He worked the remaining twelve hours on that shift. On September 13, 2012, Samartino worked a full twenty-four-hour shift. Dr. Williams indicated in his office records that Samartino presented with lipomas and three lesions. Dr. Williams felt that biopsy of the lesions was appropriate under the circumstances because Samartino was employed as a first responder, which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>has been associated with increased risk of cancer incidents. He conducted the biopsy and noted that he would call Samartino with the pathology results.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-4\">Dr. Williams provided Samartino with a note dated September 14, 2012 stating that Samartino was under his care from September 15 to 19, 2012, and that he was able to return to work on September 20, 2012. On September 15, 2012, Samartino worked twelve hours of his twenty-four-hour shift and took sick leave the remaining twelve hours. Samartino was not on the schedule to work September 16, 17, 18, or 19, 2012. Samartino was officially diagnosed with leukemia on September 18, 2012. He returned to work on September 20, 2012 and worked a full twenty-four-hour shift.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-5\">Samartino saw oncologist Dr. Jey A. Maran on October 3, 2012 \u2014 he again took sick leave for twelve hours of his twenty-four-hour shift and worked twelve hours. Dr. Maran did not restrict his work activities in any way. There is no record whether Samartino worked or took sick leave on October 18, 2012 because that date is not on his time sheet or otherwise addressed in the record. On October 19, 2012, he had a follow-up appointment with Dr. Maran. That same day Samartino worked twelve hours, took twelve hours sick leave, and earned several hours of \u201ccomp\u201d time. On October 30, 2012, he did not work his normal twenty-four-hour shift but took sick leave for 19.2 hours and annual leave for 4.8 hours.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-6\">Samartino saw Dr. Maran on December 10, 2012 after going to the emergency room the night before complaining of neck pain and a fever. Samartino worked twelve hours of his twenty-four-hour shift and took sick leave the remaining twelve hours. At the December 10, 2012 appointment, Dr. Maran concluded that Samartino\u2019s \u201ccurrent symptoms [we]re unrelated to the lymphoma.\u201d He did not put any restrictions on Samartino\u2019s work activities.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-7\">On March 3, 2013, Samartino\u2019s time sheet indicated that he took twenty-four hours of sick leave, but there is no corresponding medical record or testimony that explains his absence.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>The deputy commissioner issued a decision on January 23, 2014 granting Samartino\u2019s claim for benefits. She found that the evidence established that Samartino had been exposed to a variety of toxins over the course of his seventeen-year career as a firefighter. He was diagnosed with leukemia, and both his treating physicians opined that such exposure was a risk factor in the development of his leukemia. The deputy commissioner found that the employer presented no evidence to the contrary to rebut the statutory presumption of an award and therefore rejected the employer\u2019s claim that Samartino did not suffer a disability as a result of his leukemia. She found that Samartino was totally disabled for the dates he claimed and was entitled to the presumption granted pursuant to Code \u00a7 65.2-402(C). Samartino was awarded temporary total disability for all the claimed dates and medical benefits for as long as necessary pursuant to Code \u00a7 65.2-603.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-4\">The commission, with one commissioner dissenting, reversed the deputy commissioner\u2019s decision and concluded that Samartino failed to prove a <em>disability </em>resulting from his leukemia. The commission concluded that \u201chaving considered the evidence in its entirety, we find that the claimant was not disabled as alleged.\u201d As the factual basis for this conclusion, the commission pointed to the fact that on many of the days that Samartino claimed he was disabled he worked for twelve hours of his twenty-four-hour shift. The commission acknowledged that Samartino missed work for medical appointments \u2014 however that fact alone failed to establish that he was disabled. Drs. Williams and Maran filled out questionnaires prepared by Samartino\u2019s counsel that concluded that he was \u201ccompletely and totally disabled from any and all work as a direct result of his leukemia\u201d on all the claimed dates; however, the commission found that their conclusions were undermined by the fact that Samartino consistently performed his full duties on the days he did not attend medical appointments. Moreover, Dr. Maran\u2019s opinion that he was disabled on all the claimed dates as a direct result of his leukemia was directly contradicted by his office notes for Samartino\u2019s December 10, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>2012 visit where he concluded that Samartino\u2019s \u201ccurrent symptoms [we]re unrelated to the lymphoma.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b552-4\">\n<em>II. Analysis</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b552-5\">If supported by credible evidence, the factual findings of the commission are binding on appeal. Code \u00a7 65.2-706(A); <em>Manassas Ice &amp; Fuel Co. v. Farrar, </em>13 Va.App. 227, 229, 409 S.E.2d 824, 826 (1991). \u201cThe fact that there is contrary evidence in the record is of no consequence if there is credible evidence to support the [c]ommission\u2019s finding.\u201d <em>Wagner Enters., Inc. v. Brooks, </em>12 Va.App. 890, 894, 407 S.E.2d 32, 35 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b552-6\">Code \u00a7 65.2-402, titled \u201c[p]resumption as to death or disability from respiratory disease, hypertension or heart disease, cancer,\u201d subsection (C) provides that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AaIS\">Leukemia ... causing the death of, or any health condition or impairment resulting in total or partial disability of, any volunteer or salaried firefighter ... having completed twelve years of continuous service who has a contact with a toxic substance encountered in the line of duty shall be presumed to be an occupational disease, suffered in the line of duty, that is covered by this title, unless such presumption is overcome by a preponderance of competent evidence to the contrary.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b552-7\">\u201c \u2018In order to establish a prima facie ease, the claimant need only prove his occupation and his disability from one of the diseases identified by statute. The presumption [then] shifts the burden of going forward with the evidence from the claimant to the employer.\u2019 \u201d <em>Town of Purcellville Police v. Bromser-Kloeden, </em>35 Va.App. 252, 259, 544 S.E.2d 381, 384 (2001) (quoting <em>City of Norfolk v. Lillard, </em>15 Va.App. 424, 427, 424 S.E.2d 243, 245 (1992)).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The purpose of the Code \u00a7 65.2-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>402 presumption \u201cis to establish by law, in the absence of evidence, a causal connection between certain occupations and death or disability resulting from specified diseases.\u201d <em>Bass v. City of Richmond Police Dep\u2019t, </em>258 Va. 103, 112, 515 S.E.2d 557, 561 (1999); <em>see also Lillard, </em>15 Va.App. at 430, 424 S.E.2d at 247 (\u201cCode \u00a7 65.1-47.1 (now \u00a7 65.2-402) has long been recognized as a remedial statute, enacted by the legislature to overcome the difficulty that a firefighter would otherwise have in proving causation.\u201d). Thus, in order to establish the relevant prima facie case necessary to secure the benefit of the rebuttable presumption in Code \u00a7 65.2-402(0, a claimant must prove his occupation as a firefighter <em>and his resulting disability </em>from leukemia, or other enumerated disease. <em>See Tomes v. James City Fire, </em>39 Va.App. 424, 431-32, 573 S.E.2d 312, 316 (2002) (applying Code \u00a7 65.2402(A)).</p>\n<p id=\"b553-4\"> \u201c \u2018Disability from a disease has been defined as the stage when the disease prevents the employee from performing his work efficiently.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Salyer v. Clinchfield Coal Corp., </em>191 Va. 331, 338, 61 S.E.2d 16, 20 (1950)). Whether a claimant is disabled is a factual finding. <em>See Tumlin v. Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber, </em>18 Va.App. 375, 378, 444 S.E.2d 22, 23 (1994). If supported by credible evidence, the factual findings of the commission are binding on appeal. Code \u00a7 65.2-706(A); <em>Manassas Ice &amp; Fuel Co., </em>13 Va.App. at 229, 409 S.E.2d at 826. \u201cThe fact that there is contrary evidence in the record is of no consequence if there is credible evidence to support the Commission\u2019s finding.\u201d <em>Wagner Enters., </em>12 Va.App. at 894, 407 S.E.2d at 35. Thus, this Court is bound by the commission\u2019s factual finding that a claimant is not disabled as a result of his disease if there is credible evidence in the record to support it.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-5\">In this case, the parties agree that Samartino was a firefighter that had been diagnosed with leukemia \u2014 their only dispute was whether he had a resulting disability from his illness. The commission found that he did not. In making its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>determination, the commission relied exclusively on an unpublished opinion from this Court, <em>Lipscomb v. City of Lynchburg, </em>No. 2157-13-8, 2014 WL 2187767, 2014 Va.App. LEXIS 210 (Va.Ct.App. May 27, 2014). In <em>Lipscomb, </em>this Court held that \u201ca claimant must show entitlement to some form of economic indemnity\u201d in order to establish a prima facie case under Code \u00a7 65.2-402. <em>Id. </em>at *6, 2014 Va.App. LEXIS 210, at *18. The <em>Lipscomb </em>holding relied heavily on the reasoning articulated in an earlier unpublished opinion, <em>Lussen v. City of Roanoke Fire &amp; EMS, </em>No. 1705-03-3, 2003 WL 22951956, at *2, 2003 Va.App. LEXIS 652, at *6 (Va.Ct.App. Dec. 16, 2003), which stated: \u201cUnder the terms of Code \u00a7 65.2-402, in order for the presumption to apply and to result in an award, a covered claimant must prove [1] the disease and [2] a resulting disability.\u201d Although the claimant in <em>Lipscomb </em>provided evidence that he had one of the statutorily listed diseases and that \u201che was <em>physically </em>incapacitated for the three days he was hospitalized, he did not demonstrate any entitlement to economic indemnity for his physical incapacitation.\u201d <em>Lipscomb, </em>2014 WL 2187767, at *6, 2014 Va.App. LEXIS 210, at *19. Moreover, he could not prove that his disease affected his ability to perform his employment duties. <em>Id. </em>at *6-7, 2014 Va.App. LEXIS 210, at *18-19. Consequently, this Court held that the commission did not err in finding that Lipscomb failed to prove he suffered from a <em>disability as a result </em>of his heart disease, and therefore, the presumption in Code \u00a7 65.2-402 did not apply. <em>Id. </em>at *6, 2014 Va.App. LEXIS 210, at *18.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-4\">Today we clarify our holding in <em>Lipscomb.</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>All that is required to invoke the statutory presumption is proof of the disease and proof of a disability resulting from that disease. A right to economic indemnity is only one factor that a fact finder may consider in determining if a person is disabled as a result of his illness \u2014 in other words, whether he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>has reached \u201c \u2018the stage when the disease prevents the employee from performing his work efficiently.\u2019 \u201d <em>Tomes, </em>39 Va.App. at 431-32, 573 S.E.2d at 316 (quoting <em>Salyer, </em>191 Va. at 338, 61 S.E.2d at 20). Proof of entitlement to economic indemnity may be used to support a finding that a claimant is disabled, however its absence is not dispositive of a finding that a claimant is not disabled.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-4\">Based on the above, we hold that the commission\u2019s finding is supported by credible evidence in the record that Samartino\u2019s leukemia did not result in a disability because he was still capable of performing his full duties. For example, many of the days that he was claiming total disability, he worked for twelve hours and took sick leave for the remaining twelve hours of his twenty-four-hour shift. In sum, the commission did not find that Samartino had established a prima facie case necessary to secure the benefit of the rebuttable presumption in Code \u00a7 65.2-402(0 because he failed to prove that his leukemia had reached a stage that prevented him from performing his work efficiently, thereby making him disabled as a result of his disease. Although Samartino points to many facts in the record that may suggest he was disabled by his illness, \u201c[t]he fact that there is contrary evidence in the record is of no consequence if there is credible evidence to support the [c]ommission\u2019s finding.\u201d <em>Wagner Enters., </em>12 Va.App. at 894, 407 S.E.2d at 35.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-5\">At oral argument, Samartino argued that this interpretation of the term disability was incorrect because, if so, future claims under Code \u00a7 65.2-402(C) would be forever barred by the expiration of the two-year statute of limitations. It is certainly true that Code \u00a7 65.2-406(A)(6) provides that the right to compensation for occupational diseases \u201cshall be forever barred unless a claim is filed with the Commission within\u201d \u201ctwo years after a diagnosis of the disease is first communicated to the employee.\u201d However, we do not agree with Samartino\u2019s argument that our decision today bars him from making a claim in the future.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>In <em>Tomes, </em>the claimant, also a firefighter, was diagnosed in 1995 with \u201cvirtually reversible obstruction,\u201d which is \u201cessentially a mild asthma variant of adult onset reversible obstruction airways disease.\u201d 39 Va.App. at 427, 573 S.E.2d at 313. However, after his progressively worsening lung disease became disabling, the claimant\u2019s lung condition was diagnosed in 2000 as \u201cirreversible chronic pulmonary disease and acute exacerbation of his asthma,\u201d and his doctor directed him to not to return to work as an active firefighter for at least two months. <em>Id. </em>at 427, 573 S.E.2d at 314. The claimant filed claims in 1997 and 2000 for medical benefits. The commission rejected his 1997 claim because it found that he had \u201csustained no disability as a result of the disease communicated to him on October 30, 1995.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 431, 573 S.E.2d at 315. The commission additionally found that the claimant\u2019s 2000 claim was barred by the two-year statute of limitations because it was not a separate claim from his 1997 claim. <em>Id. </em>at 433, 573 S.E.2d at 314. This Court reversed the commission\u2019s decision and found that his 2000 claim was not barred by the two-year statute of limitations. \u201c[A]fter failing to prove he had a compensable occupational disease based on his first diagnosis and claim,\u201d the claimant \u201creceived a second diagnosis and filed a timely second claim pertaining to the same condition, which has since worsened and become compensable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 434-35, 573 S.E.2d at 317.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-4\">Expanding on the rule articulated in <em>Tomes, </em>a claimant\u2019s subsequent claim for benefits is not categorically barred by the statute of limitations merely because the claimant filed an unsuccessful earlier claim that arose from the same initial disease. If a claimant receives a second diagnosis as result of a worsening of his initial condition, his second claim may be compensable. Not every occupational disease is immediately disabling, though one may certainly progress to the point that it is. A second claim may be compensable if the illness has reached \u201c <em>\u2018the stage </em>when the disease prevents the employee from performing his work efficiently.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 431-32, 573 S.E.2d at 316 (emphasis added) (quoting <em>Salyer, </em>191 Va. at 338, 61 S.E.2d at 20).</p>\n<p id=\"b557-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>The statute of limitations for filing a claim is triggered \u201cafter a <em>diagnosis of the disease </em>is first communicated to the employee.\u201d Code \u00a7 65.2-406(A)(6) (emphasis added). Therefore, in determining if a second claim is barred by the statute of limitations the question hinges on the meaning of \u201cdiagnosis.\u201d The plain meaning of diagnosis is \u201cthe art or act of identifying a disease from its signs and symptoms.\u201d <em>Webster\u2019s Third International Dictionary </em>662 (1993). This definition is broad enough to encompass not only the identification of the name of the disease but also the identification of the disease\u2019s symptomatic progression and impact on quality of life and ability to perform tasks. Like in <em>Tomes, </em>if a patient\u2019s symptoms change or worsen, he may be diagnosed with a more severe stage of a disease and consequently trigger the beginning of a new filing period.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Construing the statute otherwise would be inconsistent with the remedial purpose of the statute to protect public servants that become ill as a result of their employment. <em>See Lillard, </em>15 Va.App. at 430, 424 S.E.2d at 247. Reading the statute in such a manner would punish employees who continue to work when they are not yet disabled by their disease because their illness has not yet reached the stage of the disease where they are prevented from performing their work efficiently.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-4\">\n<em>III. Conclusion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b557-5\">Accordingly, because there is credible evidence in the record to support the commission\u2019s factual finding that Samartino was not actually disabled by his disease because he could still perform his employment duties, we must affirm the commission\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b552-8\">. Once the claimant makes a prima facie case, in order to overcome the statutory presumption created by Code \u00a7 65.2-402 \"the employer must show, by a preponderance of the evidence, both that 1) the claimant\u2019s disease was not caused by his employment, and 2) there was a non-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>work-related cause of the disease.\u201d <em>Bass v. City of Richmond Police Dep\u2019t, </em>258 Va. 103, 114, 515 S.E.2d 557, 562-63 (1999).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b554-5\">.
