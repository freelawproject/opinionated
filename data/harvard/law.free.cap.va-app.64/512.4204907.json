HUFF, Chief Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b561-5\">Following a jury trial in the Circuit Court of the City of Radford (\u201ctrial court\u201d), Darius Oneil Dalton (\u201cappellant\u201d) was convicted of distribution of cocaine, in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-248(C), and sentenced to five years\u2019 incarceration. On appeal, appellant presents the following assignments of error:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b561-6\">1. The trial court abused its discretion by admitting certain text messages as each contained inadmissible hearsay and was admitted without proper foundation and authentication.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b561-7\">2. The trial court abused its discretion by permitting Paul Warren to testify as to the contents of a text message, not produced in discovery, and without accounting for its absence in violation of the best evidence rule.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b561-8\">3. The trial court erred by failing to grant [appellant\u2019s] motion to strike and set aside the verdict as the evidence was insufficient to support a finding beyond a reasonable doubt that [appellant] distributed cocaine.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b561-9\">For the following reasons, this Court affirms the rulings of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-10\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b561-11\">On appeal, \u201c \u2018we consider the evidence and all reasonable inferences flowing from that evidence in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, the prevailing party at trial.\u2019 \u201d <em>Williams v. Commonwealth, </em>49 Va.App. 439, 442, 642 S.E.2d 295, 296 (2007) <em>(en </em>banc) (quoting <em>Jackson v. Commonwealth, </em>267 Va. 666, 672, 594 S.E.2d 595, 598 (2004)). So viewed, the evidence is as follows.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-12\">On October 24, 2011, Radford City police officers executed a search warrant at a house where Paul Warren (\u201cWarren\u201d) was living with three roommates. The search commenced after Warren accepted a package of marijuana sent through the mail. After the search, Detectives Eric Martin (\u201cMartin\u201d) and Jimmy Smith (\u201cSmith\u201d) asked Warren whether he would be willing to work as a \u201cconfidential informant\u201d in exchange for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>\u201cconsideration\u201d of his charges.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Warren agreed to do so and provided the officers with the name of a man he knew only as \u201cStreetz.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b562-5\">Warren testified that \u201c[Streetz] used to live behind [his] house\u201d while Warren was a student at Radford. Warren testified that he met Streetz \u201cface-to-face\u201d \u201cabout 100 times.\u201d Additionally, Warren testified that he had communicated with Streetz via phone calls and text messages \u201chundreds\u201d of times. At appellant\u2019s trial, Warren identified appellant as the man he knew as \u201cStreetz.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b562-6\">Warren additionally testified that, as a confidential informant and pursuant to the direction of the officers, he texted appellant to ask if he could \u201cget a G,\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> to which appellant responded, \u201c[y]eah.\u201d Appellant objected to this testimony, arguing that \u201c[w]e need the text\u201d because Warren\u2019s testimony was \u201cnot the best evidence.\u201d The trial court overruled this objection. On cross-examination, Warren testified that he could not produce these text messages because he no longer had that phone.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-7\">Appellant agreed to sell Warren one gram of cocaine for $55. Consequently, Martin and Smith searched Warren and his vehicle to ensure he had no existing cocaine about his person, gave Warren $55 in cash to make the purchase from appellant, and equipped Warren with audio equipment to record the buy. Warren then drove to Apartment L at 1205 Clement Street, which he identified as Streetz\u2019s apartment and testified that he had been to it roughly \u201c[f]ifty\u201d times. Martin and Smith followed appellant in an unmarked police vehicle while listening to the live audio feed.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-8\">After Warren arrived, appellant\u2019s roommate, Jaleesa Cover-dale (\u201cCoverdale\u201d), opened the door and let Warren inside. Warren walked into the kitchen where appellant was weighing out one gram of cocaine. As appellant was doing so, Warren <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>told appellant that he had just \u201caced\u201d an exam in his \u201cECON 106\u201d class. Appellant responded by informing Warren that he took the same class when he was at Radford and asked whether the same professor was still teaching it.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Additionally, the two men discussed a NASCAR race that was taking place that weekend in Martinsville, VA, appellant\u2019s plans to go home for the weekend, and the possibility of future drug transactions. Finally, as he was leaving the apartment, Warren said goodbye to Coverdale and \u201cStreetz.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b563-5\">After the controlled buy, Warren gave Martin and Smith a clear plastic bag containing 0.924 gram of a white, powdery substance later determined to be cocaine. The officers searched Warren and his vehicle again to ensure that he did not have any other drugs or money.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-6\">Appellant testified on his own behalf at trial. Specifically, he admitted that he lived with Coverdale in Apartment L at 1205 Clement Street in October 2011, that he had attended Radford University where he took ECON 106, and that he had met Warren. Appellant denied selling cocaine to Warren, denied that his voice could be heard on the audio tape, denied that Warren was ever inside of his apartment, and denied using the nickname \u201cStreetz.\u201d Additionally, appellant was unable to state whether he was home on the day of the controlled buy \u2014 October 25, 2011 \u2014 and suggested that he and Coverdale might have been at a friend\u2019s house, out to eat, or at one of \u201cmany different places.\u201d He further suggested that his taking ECON 106 at Radford and knowing about the race in Martinsville were coincidences.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-7\">During the Commonwealth\u2019s case-in-chief, appellant objected to the admission into evidence of two screenshots<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> of text messages that Warren received on his cell phone. The text messages were from someone purporting to be \u201cstreets\u201d in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>first screenshot and \u201cstreetz\u201d in the second. The messages informed Warren that \u201cstreetz\u201d had lost his old phone, had gotten a new number, and was requesting that Warren provide \u201cstreetz\u201d with \u201cmikez\u201d and \u201ckellemz\u201d phone numbers. Warren replied to these messages with a phone number.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-5\">Warren testified that the messages, which were sent two months after the controlled drug buy, were sent by appellant. Appellant objected to the admission of these screenshots into evidence on hearsay grounds, arguing that the Commonwealth had not laid an adequate foundation because the messages had not been tied to appellant and were not relevant because they were \u201cbeyond the scope of the indictment.\u201d The trial court overruled these objections.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-6\">At the conclusion of all the evidence, appellant moved to strike the evidence as insufficient to support a conviction. In denying this motion, the trial court noted that this case turned on credibility determinations. After the jury convicted appellant, <em>he </em>filed a <em>motion to set </em>aside the <em>verdict, arguing that </em>he \u201cshould not have been convicted based upon the [unjcorroborated testimony of ... Warren\u201d and that the trial court erred by admitting the two screenshots into evidence because they were not produced before trial, were not properly authenticated, contained hearsay, and were offered without any context. In denying this motion, the trial court cited the jury\u2019s responsibility to judge the credibility of the witnesses and the weight of the evidence. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-7\">II. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b564-8\">A. Authentication of Text Messages</p>\n<p id=\"b564-9\">On appeal, appellant first contends that the trial court erred by allowing into evidence two screenshots of text messages sent to Warren\u2019s phone. Specifically, appellant argues the text messages in the screenshots constituted hearsay because they could not be authenticated as being sent to Warren by appellant. Assuming without deciding that the trial court abused its discretion by admitting the text mes<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>sages,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> this Court nevertheless affirms the trial court\u2019s judgment as harmless error.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-5\">\u201c \u2018No trial is perfect, and error will at times creep in.\u2019 \u201d <em>Lavinder v. Commonwealth, </em>12 Va.App. 1003, 1009, 407 S.E.2d 910, 913 (1991) (quoting <em>Parsons v. Commonwealth, </em>154 Va. 832, 852, 152 S.E. 547, 554 (1930)). \u201c \u2018Every man is entitled to a fair trial and to nothing more, and so ... out of the imperative demands of common sense, has grown the doctrine of harmless error.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Oliver v. Commonwealth, </em>151 Va. 533, 541, 145 S.E. 307, 309 (1928)) (omission in original). As \u201c[t]he effect of an error on a verdict varies widely \u2018depending upon the circumstances of the case,\u2019 ... [e]ach case must ... be analyzed individually to determine if an error has affected the verdict.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Commonwealth v. Story, </em>476 Pa. 391, 383 A.2d 155, 164 (1978)).</p>\n<p id=\"b565-6\">Code \u00a7 8.01-678, Virginia\u2019s harmless error statute, provides that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b565-7\">When it plainly appears from the record and the evidence given at the trial that the parties have had a fair trial on the merits and substantial justice has been reached, no judgment shall be arrested or reversed ... (2) For any other defect, imperfection, or omission in the record, or for any error committed on the trial.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b565-8\">Code \u00a7 8.01-678 has been applied in both criminal and civil cases. <em>See, e.g., Greenway v. Commonwealth, </em>254 Va. 147, 154, 487 S.E.2d 224, 228 (1997). \u201cIn a criminal case, it is implicit that, in order to determine whether there has been \u2018a fair trial on the merits\u2019 and whether \u2018substantial justice has been reached,\u2019 a reviewing court must decide whether the alleged error substantially influenced the jury.\u201d <em>Clay v. Commonwealth, </em>262 Va. 253, 259, 546 S.E.2d 728, 731 (2001) (quoting Code \u00a7 8.01-678).</p>\n<p id=\"b566-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>Accordingly, in Virginia the test for non-constitutional harmless error under Code \u00a7 8.01-678 in a criminal case, as adopted by the Supreme Court in <em>Clay, </em>is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b566-5\">\u201cIf, when all is said and done, the conviction is sure that the error did not influence the jury, or had but slight effect, the verdict and the judgment should stand.... But if one cannot say, with fair assurance, after pondering all that happened without stripping the erroneous action from the whole, that the judgment was not substantially swayed by the error, it is impossible to conclude that substantial rights were not affected____If so, or if one is left in grave doubt, the conviction cannot stand.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b566-8\">262 Va. at 260, 546 S.E.2d at 731-32 (quoting <em>Kotteakos v. United States, </em>328 U.S. 750, 764-65, 66 S.Ct. 1239, 1248, 90 L.Ed. 1557 (1946)).</p>\n<p id=\"b566-9\">In the present case, the admission of the screenshots into evidence was harmless error. The evidence established that Warren had met a man he knew as \u201cStreetz\u201d face-to-face approximately a hundred times before October 25, 2011. Then, during the controlled buy, Warren can be heard saying, \u201cAlright, Streetz,\u201d as he is leaving the apartment \u2014 an apartment where appellant admitted to living at the relevant time. Additionally, at trial, Warren testified that appellant was the man he knew as Streetz and that appellant had sold him one gram of cocaine for $55 on October 25, 2011. Far from being powerfully incriminating evidence, these screenshots were of marginal significance. At best, the screenshots provided some corroboration for Warren\u2019s testimony that he had been communicating with someone he called \u201cStreetz.\u201d Notwithstanding, the text messages were cumulative of otherwise overwhelming evidence admitted at trial. <em>See Dearing v. Commonwealth, </em>260 Va. 671, 673, 536 S.E.2d 903, 904 (2000) (quoting <em>Delaware v. Van Arsdall, </em>475 U.S. 673, 684, 106 S.Ct. 1431, 1437-38, 89 L.Ed.2d 674 (1986) (stating that one of the factors to consider in a constitutional harmless error analysis is whether the evidence was cumulative)); <em>see also Schwartz v. Schwartz, </em>46 Va.App. 145, 159, 616 S.E.2d 59, 66 (2005) (One measure of harmlessness is \u201cif other evidence of guilt is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>so \u2018overwhelming\u2019 and the error so insignificant by comparison ... we can conclude that the error \u2018failed to have any substantial influence on the verdict.\u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>United States v. Lane, </em>474 U.S. 438, 450, 106 S.Ct. 725, 732, 88 L.Ed.2d 814 (1986))).</p>\n<p id=\"b567-5\">Given the circumstances of this case, it \u201c \u2018plainly appears from the record and the evidence given at the trial that the parties ... had a fair trial on the merits and substantial justice has been reached.\u2019 \u201d <em>Lavinder, </em>12 Va.App. at 1005-06, 407 S.E.2d at 911 (quoting Code \u00a7 8.01-678). As such, this Court is confident \u201c \u2018that the error did not influence the jury, or had but slight effect....\u2019\u201d <em>Clay, </em>262 Va. at 260, 546 S.E.2d at 731 (quoting <em>Kotteakos, </em>328 U.S., at 764, 66 S.Ct. at 1248).</p>\n<p id=\"b567-8\">B. Best Evidence Rule</p>\n<p id=\"b567-9\">Next, appellant contends that the trial court erred by allowing Warren to testify regarding the contents of a text message he sent to appellant. Specifically, appellant argues that the text message constituted a writing, and, therefore, an original of the text itself must be introduced before Warren\u2019s testimony regarding the contents will be allowed under the best evidence rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-10\">\u201cGenerally, the admissibility of evidence is within the discretion of the trial court,\u201d and an appellate court will not reject the trial court\u2019s decision absent an abuse of discretion. <em>Midkiff v. Commonwealth, </em>280 Va. 216, 219, 694 S.E.2d 576, 578 (2010). A \u201ctrial judge\u2019s ruling will not be reversed simply because an appellate court disagrees.\u201d <em>Thomas v. Commonwealth, </em>44 Va.App. 741, 753, 607 S.E.2d 738, 743, <em>adopted upon reh\u2019g en banc, </em>45 Va.App. 811, 613 S.E.2d 870 (2005). Instead, a reviewing court can only conclude that an abuse of discretion has occurred in cases where \u201creasonable jurists could not differ\u201d about the correct result. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b567-11\">The \u201cbest evidence rule,\u201d which made its appearance in the English law in the early part of the eighteenth century, was not originally a \u201crule,\u201d but rather \u201ca general observation to the effect that when one sets out to prove something, one ought to prove it by the most reliable evidence available.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>Charles E. Friend, Kent Sinclair, <em>The Law of Evidence in Virginia </em>\u00a7 18-1 (7th ed.2012). Comments to this effect appear in the earliest Virginia cases: \u201c[t]he best evidence which the nature of the case admits of, ought to be produced, and if it may be produced, inferior testimony is inadmissible.\u201d <em>Lee v. Tapscott, </em>2 Va. 276, 280-81 (1796).</p>\n<p id=\"b568-5\">Today, however, this rule is much narrower. Indeed, it is well-established in modern practice that \u201cthe best evidence rule in Virginia applies only to writings.....\u201d <em>Brown v. Commonwealth, </em>54 Va.App. 107, 116, 676 S.E.2d 326, 330 (2009). \u201cAs a legal term of art, \u2018the best evidence rule requires that where the contents of a writing are desired to be proved, the writing itself must be produced or its absence sufficiently accounted for before other evidence of its contents can be admitted.\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 115, 676 S.E.2d at 330 (quoting <em>Bradshaw v. Commonwealth, </em>16 Va.App. 374, 379, 429 S.E.2d 881, 885 (1993)). The definition and scope of the best evidence rule have been succinctly summarized in Rule 2:1002, which provides that \u201c[t]o prove the content of a writing, the original writing is required, except as otherwise provided in these rules, Rules of the Supreme Court of Virginia, or in a Virginia statute.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b568-8\">In the present case, appellant argues that Warren\u2019s testimony regarding the contents of the text message should have been inadmissible under the best evidence rule unless an original of the text itself was first admitted. \u201cNo Virginia appellate court,\u201d however, has \u201cdetermined whether a text message [constitutes] a \u2018writing\u2019 for the purposes of the best evidence rule.\u201d <em>See Cobb v. Commonwealth, </em>No. 1526-12-1, 2013 WL 5744363, at *4, 2013 Va.App. LEXIS 301, at *14 (Va.Ct.App. Oct. 22, 2013) (assuming without deciding that a text message qualifies as a writing).</p>\n<p id=\"b568-9\">\u201cFor purposes of [the best evidence rule],\u201d Rule 2:1001(1) broadly defines \u201cwritings\u201d as \u201cletters, words, or numbers, or their equivalent, set down by handwriting, typewriting, printing, photostating, photographing, magnetic impulse, mechanical or electronic recording, or other form of data compilation or preservation.\u201d This Court has noted that \u201c[t]he potentially <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>limitless application of computer technology to evidentiary questions will continually require legal adaptation.\u201d <em>Penny v. Commonwealth, </em>6 Va.App. 494, 499, 370 S.E.2d 314, 317 (1988). Even the text of Rule 2:1001(1) acknowledges advancements in computer technology by providing that a \u201cwriting\u201d may be produced not only by handwriting, but also by electronic recording.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-5\">Considering these circumstances, it is readily apparent that text messages fall within Rule 2:1001(l)\u2019s broad definition as they consist of letters, words, and numbers set down by electronic recording.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Notably, other state and federal courts, applying similar rules of evidence, have also determined that text messages constitute writings for the purposes of the best evidence rule. <em>See United States v. Harry, </em>927 F.Supp.2d 1185, 1227 (D.N.M.2013) (applying the best evidence rule to text messages); <em>Lorraine v. Market Am. Ins. Co., </em>241 F.R.D. 534, 577 (D.Md.2007); <em>State v. Espiritu, </em>117 Hawai'i 127, 176 P.3d 885, 893 (2008) (noting that the best evidence rule is \u201cparticularly suited\u201d to electronic evidence and admitting testimony about text messages under the best evidence rule when original messages and cell phone were unavailable and there was no evidence of proponent\u2019s bad faith); <em>Laughner v. State, </em>769 N.E.2d 1147, 1159 (Ind.Ct.App.2002) (holding that text messages sent between computers through an internet chat room were subject to the original writing rule and a printout of the messages was an original for purposes of that rule), <em>cert. denied, </em>538 U.S. 1013, 123 S.Ct. 1929, 155 L.Ed.2d 849 (2003), <em>abrogated on other grounds by Fajardo v. State, </em>859 N.E.2d 1201 (Ind.2007). Accordingly, this Court holds that text messages constitute writings for the purposes of the best evidence rule.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b570-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>This does not end our inquiry, however. Under the best evidence rule, \u201c \u2018where the contents of a writing are desired to be proved, the writing itself must be produced <em>or its absence sufficiently accounted for </em>before other evidence of its contents can be admitted.\u2019 \u201d <em>Brown, </em>54 Va.App. at 115, 676 S.E.2d at 330 (emphasis added) (quoting <em>Bradshaw, </em>16 Va.App. at 379, 429 S.E.2d at 885). Indeed, Rule 2:1004 provides a list of exceptions where an</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ATq\">original is not required, and other evidence of the contents of a writing is admissible ...:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b570-7\">(a) <em>Originals lost or destroyed. </em>All originals are lost or have been destroyed, unless the proponent lost or destroyed them in bad faith; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b570-8\">(b) <em>Original not obtainable. </em>No original can be obtained by any available judicial process or procedure, unless the proponent acted in bad faith to render the original unavailable; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b570-9\">(c) <em>Original in possession of opponent. </em>At a time when an original was under the control of the party against whom offered, that party was put on notice, by the pleadings or otherwise, that the contents would be a subject of proof at the hearing, and that party does not produce the original at the hearing; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b570-10\">(d) <em>Collateral matters. </em>The writing is not closely related to a controlling issue.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b570-11\">(Emphasis in original). \u201cThe test of unavailability is proof with reasonable certainty,\u201d <em>Bradshaw, </em>16 Va.App. at 380, 429 S.E.2d at 885, and this question \u2014 a preliminary issue regarding the admissibility of evidence \u2014 is \u201caddressed to the sound discretion of the trial court,\u201d Rule 2:104(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b570-12\">In the present case, Warren testified that he could not produce the text messages because he did \u201cnot have that phone any longer,\u201d and therefore did not have the messages either. As such, Rule 2:1004(a) and (b) are applicable to the present context as the text messages were both lost and unattainable. Indeed the exceptions of Rule 2:1004 are particularly suited to electronic evidence given the myriad of ways <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>that electronic records may be deleted, lost, or purged as a result of routine electronic records management. Additionally, there is no evidence which suggests that the absence of the text messages in the present case was a result of bad faith. Accordingly, this Court cannot say that the trial court abused its discretion by allowing Warren\u2019s testimony regarding the content of the text messages because there was sufficient accounting for the absence of the text messages.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-4\">C. Sufficiency of the Evidence</p>\n<p id=\"b571-5\">Lastly, appellant contends that the evidence was insufficient to support his conviction for distribution of cocaine. Specifically, he argues that because of the lack of physical evidence and Warren\u2019s inherently incredible testimony, appellant\u2019s conviction should be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-6\">Our standard for reviewing the sufficiency of the evidence is firmly established:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b571-7\">[W]hen the sufficiency of the evidence is challenged on appeal, the evidence and all reasonable inferences fairly drawn therefrom must be viewed in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth. The trial court\u2019s judgment should be affirmed unless it appears that it is plainly wrong or without evidence to support it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b571-8\"><em>Spencer v. Commonwealth, </em>238 Va. 275, 283, 384 S.E.2d 775, 779 (1989) (citations omitted). Additionally, under this familiar standard of review, \u201c[a]n appellate court does not \u2018ask itself whether <em>it </em>believes that the evidence at the trial established guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\u2019 \u201d <em>Williams v. Commonwealth, </em>278 Va. 190, 193, 677 S.E.2d 280, 282 (2009) (emphasis in original) (quoting <em>Jackson v. Virginia, </em>443 U.S. 307, 318-19, 99 S.Ct. 2781, 2789, 61 L.Ed.2d 560 (1979)). \u201cRather, the relevant question is whether <em>\u2018any </em>rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b571-9\">\u201cDetermining the credibility of witnesses ... is within the exclusive province of the jury, which has the unique opportunity to observe the demeanor of the witnesses as they testify.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number><em>Lea v. Commonwealth, </em>16 Va.App. 300, 304, 429 S.E.2d 477, 479 (1993). Therefore, this Court will not disturb the fact finder\u2019s determination of the credibility of witness testimony unless, \u201cas a matter of law, the testimony is inherently incredible.\u201d <em>Walker v. Commonwealth, </em>258 Va. 54, 70-71, 515 S.E.2d 565, 575 (1999). Indeed, \u201c[t]he living record contains many guideposts to the truth which are not in the printed record,\u201d and an appellate court, not having the benefit of these guideposts, \u201cshould give great weight to the conclusions of those who have seen and heard them.\u201d <em>Bradley v. Commonwealth, </em>196 Va. 1126, 1136, 86 S.E.2d 828, 834 (1955).</p>\n<p id=\"b572-5\">In the present case, Warren, after testifying that he had seen appellant face-to-face approximately a hundred times, identified appellant in court as the man he knows as \u201cStreetz.\u201d Subsequently, Warren testified that at the direction of Martin and Smith, he went to appellant\u2019s apartment where appellant sold Warren approximately one gram of cocaine for $55. This testimony is corroborated by the audio recording and by the fact that Warren was searched by the officers before and after the controlled buy. Moreover, in the audio recording, Warren can be heard saying goodbye to \u201cStreetz.\u201d This evidence is sufficient to support appellant\u2019s conviction for distribution of cocaine.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-6\">Nevertheless, appellant points to the numerous instances in which Warren\u2019s testimony was impeached and argues that this testimony was therefore not sufficient to support appellant\u2019s conviction. As the Supreme Court has explained, however,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b572-7\">[w]hen the law says that it is for the trier of fact to judge the credibility of a witness, the issue is not a matter of degree. So long as a witness deposes as to facts, which, if true, are sufficient to maintain their verdict, then the fact that the witness\u2019 credit is impeached by contrary statements affects only the witness\u2019 credibility ... [and] the weight and sufficiency of the testimony. If the trier of the facts sees fit to base the verdict upon that testimony, there can be no relief in the appellate court.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A7K\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number><em>Simpson v.

In this case, the jury saw fit to convict appellant based on Warren\u2019s testimony, and this Court will not reverse this conviction because it is not plainly wrong or without evidence to support it.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-4\">III.
