Appellant alleges that the deputy commissioner erred in awarding attorney\u2019s fees to counsel for Reginald Davis (\u201cclaimant\u201d) from the amount paid for his medical care at appellant\u2019s medical facility. Appellant argues that the deputy commissioner\u2019s award violated due process and that the commission erred in refusing to set aside the award. Appellant also contends that the commission erred in finding it had jurisdiction to impose a fee against appellant pursuant to Code \u00a7 65.2-714. We find no error and affirm the commission\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"660\">*660</page-number>I. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b706-4\">On appeal, this Court views the evidence in the light most favorable to the prevailing party below. <em>See R.G. Moore Bldg. Corp. v. Mullins, </em>10 Va.App. 211, 212, 390 S.E.2d 788, 788 (1990). So viewed, the evidence established that in November 2011, claimant sustained a compensable injury by accident to his right knee. The commission awarded medical benefits for the injury against claimant\u2019s employer and its insurance carrier. In late 2012, claimant filed a claim seeking authorization for a right knee total arthroplasty revision surgery. Employer and insurer initially denied the claim for surgery, stating that the injury requiring surgery was not causally related to or a result of the 2011 compensable injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-5\">In February 2013, while his claim was pending, claimant underwent a right total knee arthroplasty revision at appellant\u2019s Tampa, Florida hospital. The hospital billed insurer\u2019s claims\u2019 administrator $119,496.33 for services related to claimant\u2019s surgery. Before a scheduled evidentiary hearing on claimant\u2019s request for authorization and compensation for his knee surgery, employer and insurer abandoned their defenses and executed a stipulated order authorizing claimant\u2019s knee surgery. The commission approved the agreed order on March 15, 2013. Subsequently, insurer paid appellant $80,217.45.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-6\">On September 5, 2013, claimant\u2019s attorney sent appellant a request for payment of attorney\u2019s fees pursuant to Code \u00a7 65.2-714, seeking $20,054 from appellant.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The letter was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"661\">*661</page-number>sent by facsimile to Debbie Wisler and listed appellant\u2019s Tampa, Florida address. This was appellant\u2019s last known address.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> When claimant\u2019s attorney received no response to his request from appellant, on October 20, 2013, he filed a claim for his Code \u00a7 65.2-714 attorney\u2019s fees with the commission. Claimant\u2019s attorney sent a copy of his claim to appellant\u2019s Tampa, Florida address. On October 24, 2013, the commission issued a notice of an on-the-record hearing permitting each party to file a statement of position and documentary evidence by November 13, 2013. Responsive position statements were to be filed by November 23, 2013. Copies of the notice were mailed to claimant, his attorney, claimant\u2019s employer, the insurance carrier and claims administrator, the claims administrator\u2019s attorney, and appellant at its Tampa, Florida address. On October 31, 2013, and November 4, 2013, respectively, the deputy commissioner sent letters to appellant and claimant\u2019s counsel suggesting alternate dispute resolution and inquiring if the parties would be open to mediation. Both letters were again sent to appellant\u2019s Tampa, Florida address.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-4\">Claimant\u2019s attorney filed his position statement and provided supporting documentation on November 13, 2013. On November 18, 2013, claimant\u2019s attorney faxed a copy of his position statement and supporting documentation, which included a copy of the original claim and other correspondence, to Christopher Gena, a project manager at the company to which appellant apparently outsourced management of its Florida business address. Again, appellant filed no response.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-5\">On November 26, 2013, the deputy commissioner issued an opinion granting claimant\u2019s attorney\u2019s requested fee of $20,054.36. A copy of the opinion was mailed to appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"662\">*662</page-number>On January 16, 2014, appellant\u2019s attorney filed an objection to the assessment of the fee. Appellant asserted that the commission lacked jurisdiction to award the attorney\u2019s fee because appellant was located in Florida and, therefore, was not a healthcare provider as defined by Code \u00a7 65.2-714. The deputy commissioner responded that she no longer had jurisdiction, as her opinion was issued on November 26, 2013.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-4\">On February 7, 2014, appellant\u2019s attorney filed a motion to vacate and set aside the deputy commissioner\u2019s opinion. Counsel argued that appellant\u2019s right to due process of law had been violated and that the commission had no jurisdiction to award the fee. Counsel supplied an affidavit from Shaun Smith, Corporate Manager for Legal and Risk Services for appellant. Smith admitted that he received a copy of claimant\u2019s position statement after it was faxed to Christopher Gena on or about November 19, 2013; however, Smith stated that he did not recognize its significance at the time. Smith stated that appellant did not receive the claim, notice of the on-the-record hearing, or the deputy commissioner\u2019s opinion until after appellant retained counsel in Virginia.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b708-5\">Claimant\u2019s attorney responded that the motion to vacate was untimely as filed more than thirty days after the deputy commissioner\u2019s opinion. Claimant\u2019s attorney also noted that none of the correspondence sent to appellant had been returned as undeliverable. Finally, claimant\u2019s attorney disputed the claim that the commission did not have jurisdiction to award the attorney\u2019s fee.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-6\">On February 20, 2014, the deputy commissioner referred the motion to vacate to the full commission for review.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Both <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"663\">*663</page-number>parties thereafter filed written statements. By opinion dated October 3, 2014, the commission concluded that appellant\u2019s request for review of the deputy commissioner\u2019s opinion was untimely. Therefore, the commission did not address any of appellant\u2019s claims with the exception of its jurisdictional challenge, where the commission concluded that appellant consented to jurisdiction under the Act by accepting payment in a workers\u2019 compensation case. Accordingly, the commission upheld the award of attorney\u2019s fees. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-4\">II. Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b709-5\">Appellant contends that the commission erred in failing to vacate and set aside the deputy commissioner\u2019s award of attorney\u2019s fees. Appellant argues that the award violated its right to due process because it was denied its right to notice and an opportunity to be heard.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-6\">A. Timeliness of appellant\u2019s request for review</p>\n<p id=\"b709-7\">As the full commission concluded, consideration of any complaint appellant may have had about proceedings before the deputy commissioner is time-barred. Commission Rule 3.1 provides that \u201cA request for review of a decision, order or award of the [cjommission <em>shall be filed by a party in writing </em>with the Clerk of the [cjommission <em>within thirty (30) days of the date of such decision, </em>order or award.\u201d (Emphasis added). Likewise, Code \u00a7 65.2-705(A) provides, \u201cIf an application for review is made to the [cjommission <em>within 30 days after issuance of an award, </em>the full [cjommission ... shall review the evidence or ... hear the parties at issue, their representatives, and witnesses.\u201d (Emphasis added). The deputy commissioner issued her opinion on November 26, 2013, and appellant did not file its objection until January 16, 2014. Therefore, appellant\u2019s request was untimely and, absent an allegation of fraud or mistake, the full commission had no jurisdiction to hear appellant\u2019s request for review or motion to set aside the deputy commissioner\u2019s award. <em>See McCarthy Electric Co., Inc. v. Foster, </em>17 Va.App. 344, 345, 437 S.E.2d 246, 247 (1993) (\u201cIf the application for review is not made <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"664\">*664</page-number>within the [thirty]-day limitation period, the commission has no jurisdiction to review the matter unless the petitioning party alleges fraud or mistake in the procurement of the award.\u201d <em>(citing K &amp; L Trucking Co. v. Thurber, </em>1 Va.App. 213, 218, 337 S.E.2d 299, 302 (1985))).</p>\n<p id=\"b710-4\">The commission found no evidence of \u201cfraud, mistake or imposition sufficient to permit [the commission] to review the [deputy commissioner\u2019s] Opinion.\u201d The commission\u2019s determination is supported by the record. While appellant argued in its motion that it did not receive notice of the commission\u2019s notices of on-the-record hearings or entry of the deputy commissioner\u2019s award, appellant concedes that it did receive a copy of claimant\u2019s position statement on or about November 19, 2013, a full week before the deputy commissioner issued her opinion. Claimant\u2019s position statement set forth the history of claimant\u2019s medical procedure, the amounts and bills paid, quoted in its entirety Code \u00a7 65.2-714(B), and provided the date claimant filed his claim for attorney\u2019s fees, and the total fees sought. Further, attached to his position statement, claimant\u2019s attorney provided copies of his claim for fees, the agreed order and stipulations between claimant, employer, and insurer, a copy of bills sent by appellant to claimant, and claimant\u2019s counsel\u2019s September 5, 2013 letter to appellant requesting fees. To its credit, appellant simply states that it was unfamiliar with Virginia Workers\u2019 Compensation law and therefore, \u201cdid not recognize the significance of such document.\u201d This unfortunate and obviously regrettable oversight by appellant does not equate to the existence of fraud or mistake in the procurement of claimant\u2019s attorney\u2019s fee award.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-5\">Additionally, and tellingly, appellant never asserts that the Tampa, Florida address to which notices were sent was incorrect, only that it was not the address of its registered agent. Further, as noted by claimant, none of the documents sent to the appellant\u2019s Tampa, Florida address were returned undeliverable. Appellant\u2019s arguments regarding the lack of notice it received are \u201cnot the type[s] of \u2018mistake[s] in the procurement of the award\u2019 contemplated by Virginia\u2019s case law\u201d and there<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"665\">*665</page-number>fore, we hold that the commission did not err in determining that its review of the deputy commissioner\u2019s award was time-barred. <em>See McCarthy, </em>17 Va.App. at 347, 437 S.E.2d at 248 (commission\u2019s failure to send a copy of the penalty award to employer when employer received notice of employee\u2019s request for penalty award insufficient to allege fraud or mistake allowing commission to consider an untimely appeal).</p>\n<p id=\"b711-4\">B. Jurisdiction</p>\n<p id=\"b711-5\">We agree with the commission\u2019s determination that it had jurisdiction to award attorney\u2019s fees against appellant in this case and hold that a party consents to the commission\u2019s jurisdiction by accepting payment of a claimant\u2019s bills, pursuant to a workers\u2019 compensation award.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The workers\u2019 compensation process provides an optional alternative to traditional civil remedies. One way a provider can \u201copt in\u201d and consent to the jurisdiction of the commission is by accepting payment pursuant to a workers\u2019 compensation award. Therefore, we hold that by accepting payment of claimant\u2019s medical bills from insurer in this case, appellant consented to the jurisdiction of the commission and Virginia Workers\u2019 Compensation law.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Consequently, the commission correctly found <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"666\">*666</page-number>that the deputy commissioner had jurisdiction to assess an award of attorney\u2019s fees against appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-4\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b706-7\">. Code \u00a7 65.2-714 provides in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b706-8\">A.

If a contested claim is held to be compensable under this title and, after a hearing on the claim on its merits or after abandonment of a defense by the employer or insurance carrier, benefits for medical services are awarded and inure to the benefit of a third party insurance carrier or health care provider, the Commission shall award to the employee's attorney a reasonable fee and other reasonable pro rata costs as are appropriate from the sum which benefits <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"661\">*661</page-number>the third party insurance carrier or health care provider. Such fees shall be based on the amount paid by the employer or insurance carrier to the third party insurance carrier or health care provider for medical, surgical and hospital service rendered to the employee through the date on which the contested claim is heard before the Deputy Commissioner....</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b707-7\">. The letter listed appellant\u2019s address at 6001 Webb Road, Tampa, FL 33615. This was apparently the hospital facility\u2019s street address.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b708-7\">. The record does not reflect how appellant eventually became aware of the deputy commissioner's award or when it retained counsel in Virginia.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b708-8\">. Initially, appellant's motion to vacate was referred to the on-the-record hearing docket. However, in her February 20, 2014 letter, the deputy commissioner stated that the matter had been referred to the on-the-record docket erroneously, and referred the matter instead to the full commission.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b711-6\">. <em>See Fairfax Hospital Ass\u2019n v.
