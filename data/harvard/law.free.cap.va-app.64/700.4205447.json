For the reasons expressed below, we agree and reverse appellant\u2019s conviction under Code \u00a7 46.2-301(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b748-7\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b748-8\">The facts in this matter are not in dispute. On November 6, 2013, appellant was driving in Loudoun County when he was stopped by Officer Clark McDaniel. During the course of the stop, Officer McDaniel used the computer in his patrol car to access appellant\u2019s Department of Motor Vehicles (\u201cDMV\u201d) record, which listed appellant\u2019s driver\u2019s license status as \u201crevoked.\u201d When asked whether he possessed a driver\u2019s license, appellant responded that he did not. Appellant was arrested and subsequently charged with driving on a suspended or revoked license, in violation of Code \u00a7 46.2-301(B).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b748-9\">At appellant\u2019s bench trial, the Commonwealth introduced appellant\u2019s DMV record as an exhibit. The transcript reflects that on February 15, 2008, appellant was convicted of driving while intoxicated, a first offense, and that the trial court suspended his driver\u2019s license for a period of twelve months. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"703\">*703</page-number>Shortly thereafter, upon receipt of appellant\u2019s conviction order, the Commissioner of the DMV, pursuant to Code \u00a7 46.2-389,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> revoked appellant\u2019s license for a term ending on February 8, 2009.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-5\">According to his transcript, appellant was again convicted of driving while intoxicated on February 25, 2008. As before, the trial court suspended appellant\u2019s license for twelve months, and the Commissioner revoked appellant\u2019s license upon receipt of appellant\u2019s conviction order. Appellant\u2019s transcript lists the \u201cterm\u201d of this revocation as February 18, 2009.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-6\">In addition to the two periods of revocation, appellant\u2019s transcript lists five separate suspensions (each for an indefinite period) incurred by appellant for failing to pay fines and court costs associated with prior court proceedings (including appellant\u2019s two convictions for driving while intoxicated).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> During trial, appellant introduced receipts proving that he paid in full his past due fines and court costs relating to all of the prior convictions approximately two months before he was stopped by Officer McDaniel. Appellant testified, however, that he had not paid any reinstatement fees; nor had he applied for a new or renewal driver\u2019s license at the time he was stopped.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-7\">At the close of the evidence, appellant argued that he was not driving on a suspended or revoked license when he was stopped by Officer McDaniel because the periods of suspension and revocation had ended. According to appellant, his indefinite suspensions terminated upon payment of his past due fines and court costs, while each of his revocations expired on set dates prior to when he was stopped \u2014 February 8, 2009 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"704\">*704</page-number>and February 18, 2009, respectively. Because Code \u00a7 46.2-301(B) penalizes driving only during the period of suspension or revocation, appellant asserted that the evidence was insufficient to support his conviction. Appellant further asserted that his failure to reapply for a new or renewal license had no bearing on whether the periods of suspension and revocation ended prior to when he was stopped. At most, appellant contended that he was guilty of violating Code \u00a7 46.2-300, which punishes as a Class 2 misdemeanor any person who drives without a valid license on a highway in the Commonwealth.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-4\">Following the parties\u2019 closing arguments, the trial court convicted appellant of driving after his privilege was suspended or revoked. In reaching its decision, the trial court noted that Code \u00a7 46.2-100 draws a distinction between suspension and revocation: While the trial court recognized some \u201cmerit to [appellant\u2019s] argument about suspension \u2014 the idea that ... it might be self-curing, that you pay and you no longer have that suspension because it was only suspended indefinitely until you pay,\u201d the trial court found no support for appellant\u2019s argument that a revocation terminated prior to restoration of one\u2019s driver\u2019s license. Relying on appellant\u2019s DMV transcript, which identified appellant\u2019s then-status as revoked, the trial court found appellant guilty of driving on a revoked license.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-5\">This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-6\">ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b750-7\">Appellant contends that the trial court erred by finding the evidence sufficient to support his conviction of driving under a suspended or revoked license. According to appellant, his license was neither suspended nor revoked when he was stopped by Officer McDaniel. This is so, appellant says, because the period of his license suspension terminated upon payment of his outstanding court costs, and his period of revocation ended years prior to his arrest for driving under a revoked license. Although appellant concedes that he did not formally reapply to have his license reinstated or renewed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"705\">*705</page-number>after the term of his suspension and revocation ended, he contends that his failure to reapply for a reinstated license is immaterial to his conviction under Code \u00a7 46.2-301(B), because \u201cthe revocation provisions [of Chapter 3 of Title 46.2] separate the termination of the revocation from the reinstatement of one\u2019s [license]\u201d and \u201crevocation must end before reinstatement may occur.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Br. at 12. In other words, appellant asserts that, although he was an unlicensed driver at the time he was stopped,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> he was not guilty of driving under a <em>revoked </em>license because Code \u00a7 46.2-301(B) penalizes driving on a suspended or revoked license only \u201cuntil the period of suspension or revocation has terminated,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 4, and both periods expired before the date of his stop. Accordingly, appellant contends that the Commonwealth did not meet its burden of proving a violation of Code \u00a7 46.2-301(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b751-4\">In response, the Commonwealth contends that the suspension and revocation of appellant\u2019s license remained in effect at the time of his arrest, because \u201ca suspension or revocation does not end automatically by operation of law, but instead continues until a new license is applied for and issued.\u201d Commonwealth\u2019s Br. at 8. According to the Commonwealth, this conclusion follows primarily from Code \u00a7 46.2-411(C), which states that \u201c[an] order of suspension or revocation shall remain in effect and the driver\u2019s license, ... shall not be reinstated and no new driver\u2019s license, ... shall be issued or granted unless such person, in addition to complying with all other provisions of law, pays to the Commissioner a reinstatement fee.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Because the Commissioner was not permitted to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"706\">*706</page-number>issue appellant a new or renewal license until appellant satisfied these statutory prerequisites, which appellant admittedly did not complete following the terms of his suspension and revocation, the Commonwealth asserts that appellant\u2019s suspension and revocation remained in effect at the time of his stop.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-5\">The issue presented in this appeal raises a question of statutory construction, which we review <em>de novo. Kirby v. Commonwealth, </em>63 Va.App. 665, 669, 762 S.E.2d 414, 416 (2014). Our review is guided by well-settled principles.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b752-6\">\u201cIt is one of the fundamental rules of construction of statutes that the intention of the legislature is to be gathered from a view of the whole and every part of the statute taken and compared together, giving to every word and every part of the statute, if possible, its due effect and meaning, and to the words used their ordinary and popular meaning, unless it plainly appears that they were used in some other sense. If the intention of the legislature can be thus discovered, it is not permissible to add to or subtract from the words used in the statute.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b752-7\"><em>Shreve v. Commonwealth, </em>44 Va.App. 541, 546-47, 605 S.E.2d 780, 782 (2004) (quoting <em>Posey v. Commonwealth, </em>123 Va. 551, 553, 96 S.E. 771, 771 (1918)). We are also mindful that a proceeding under Code \u00a7 46.2-301 is criminal, and violations are punished as misdemeanors. Accordingly, Code \u00a7 46.2-301 \u201c \u2018must be strictly construed against the state and limited in application to cases falling clearly within the language of the statute.\u2019 \u201d <em>Davis v. Commonwealth, </em>12 Va.App. 246, 248, 402 S.E.2d 711, 712 (1991) (quoting <em>Crews v. Commonwealth, </em>3 Va.App. 531, 536, 352 S.E.2d 1, 3 (1987)).</p>\n<p id=\"b752-8\">Code \u00a7 46.2-301(B) prohibits an individual whose driver\u2019s license has been suspended or revoked from driving \u201cuntil the period of such suspension or revocation has terminated or the privilege has been reinstated or a restricted license is issued.\u201d In other words, this statutory provision criminalizes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"707\">*707</page-number>driving only during the period in which one\u2019s driver\u2019s license is suspended or revoked. <em>See Paduano v. Commonwealth, </em>64 Va.App. 173, 180, 766 S.E.2d 745, 748 (2014) (\u201c \u2018Courts are required to apply the plain language of a statute when possible and may not rewrite it.\u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>Parker v. Warren, </em>273 Va. 20, 23, 639 S.E.2d 179, 181 (2007))). It follows no less clearly from Code \u00a7 46.2-301(B)\u2019s plain language that license suspensions and revocations have defined beginnings and endings; that is the natural import of the phrase \u201cthe period of ... suspension or revocation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b753-5\">Moreover, those periods of suspension and revocation come about independent of the Commissioner\u2019s reinstatement or renewal of one\u2019s driver\u2019s license. Code \u00a7 46.2-100 clarifies this point. Under that provision, the legislature has defined \u201csuspension\u201d to \u201cmean[ ] that the document or privilege suspended has been temporarily withdrawn, but may be reinstated <em>following the period of suspension </em>\u201d and \u201crevocation\u201d to \u201cmean that the document or privilege revoked is not subject to renewal or restoration except through reapplication <em>after the expiration of the period of revocation.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added). In other words, Code \u00a7 46.2-100 references the reinstatement or renewal of a suspended or revoked license as an event separate from (and in this context, subsequent to) the termination of the period of suspension or revocation. Thus, Code \u00a7 46.2-100 makes reinstatement or renewal of a driver\u2019s license contingent upon the termination of the period of suspension or revocation \u2014 not vice versa, as the Commonwealth contends.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-6\">Furthermore, to adopt the Commonwealth\u2019s assertion \u2014 that a period of \u201csuspension or revocation ... continues until a new license is applied for and issued\u201d \u2014 would not only invert this relationship but also conflate the Commissioner\u2019s authority to suspend or revoke a license with his distinct authority to issue a new or renewal license. While the issuance of a new or renewal license is \"within the Commissioner\u2019s broad discretion, <em>see </em>Code \u00a7 46.2-411(A) (stating that the Commissioner may refuse to issue any new or renewal license <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"708\">*708</page-number>to an individual whose license has been suspended or revoked \u201cwhenever he deems ... it necessary for the safety of the public\u201d), the Commissioner\u2019s authority to suspend or revoke a driver\u2019s license is strictly circumscribed by statute, <em>see generally </em>Code \u00a7 46.2-410 (noting that suspension or revocation of a license is mandatory in certain cases). In other words, the Commissioner\u2019s authority to suspend or revoke an individual\u2019s driver\u2019s license extends no further than the authorizing statute permits.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-5\">As relevant here, Code \u00a7 46.2-389 mandated revocation of appellant\u2019s license \u201cfor one year\u201d upon the Commissioner receiving a record from the trial court of appellant\u2019s convictions for driving while intoxicated. Appellant incurred both convictions in February 2008, the trial court notified the Commissioner on both occasions within the same month, and the Commissioner issued revocation orders shortly thereafter. Appellant\u2019s period of revocation therefore lasted no later than February 2009. <em>See </em>App. at 68 (appellant\u2019s DMV transcript identifying the \u201cterm\u201d of his revocations as February 8, 2009 and February 18, 2009, respectively). Similarly, Code \u00a7 46.2-395(B) authorized suspension of appellant\u2019s license upon his failure to pay court costs and fines assessed against him by the trial court \u2014 but only until the costs \u201cha[d] been paid in full.\u201d The undisputed facts of this case establish that appellant paid in full his assessed court costs and fines approximately two months prior to when he was stopped. Accordingly, the periods of suspension and revocation assessed against appellant terminated prior to when he was stopped by Officer McDaniel.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-6\">Although appellant concedes that he made no effort to acquire a new driver\u2019s license following the termination of the relevant periods of suspension and revocation, this failure had no bearing on whether he violated Code \u00a7 46.2-301(B). The periods of suspension and revocation terminated by operation of the same statutory provisions that first authorized them<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>\u2014 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"709\">*709</page-number>and appellant\u2019s failure to complete the necessary steps to acquire a new license (those relied upon by the Commonwealth on brief) concerns only whether appellant is validly permitted to drive in the Commonwealth. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 46.2-300 (punishing as a Class 2 misdemeanor any person who drives any motor vehicle on any highway in the Commonwealth without a valid license). This conclusion is apparent from the very statutory provision relied upon by the Commonwealth. While Code \u00a7 46.2-411(0 states that an \u201corder of suspension or revocation shall remain in effect\u201d until an individual \u201cpays to the Commissioner a reinstatement fee,\u201d Code \u00a7 46.2-302 provides that an individual who \u201chas failed to pay a reinstatement fee, shall be tried under [Code] \u00a7 46.2-300\u201d \u2014 not, as here, under Code \u00a7 46.2-301(B).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b755-5\">This is so because, while Code \u00a7 46.2-411(0 states that \u201c[an] order of suspension or revocation shall remain in effect,\u201d it does not perpetuate the \u201cperiod of suspension or revocation\u201d that is the focus of Code \u00a7 46.2-301(B). The termination of a period of suspension or revocation precedes the reinstatement (or in the case of revocation, restoration) of one\u2019s license. <em>See </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"710\">*710</page-number>Code \u00a7 46.2-100 (stating that a revoked license may be restored \u201cthrough reapplication <em>after the expiration of the period of revocation </em>\u201d and a suspended license may be reinstated <em>\u201cfollowing the period of suspension </em>\u201d (emphasis added)). It is the termination of the period of suspension or revocation that triggers an individual\u2019s eligibility for reinstatement (or restoration). It makes little sense, then, to suggest that the period of suspension or revocation continues until the reinstatement fee is paid.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-5\">Moreover, Code \u00a7 46.2-411(0 grants to the Commissioner the discretion to waive repayment of the reinstatement fee \u201c[w]hen three years have elapsed <em>from the termination date of the order of suspension or revocation </em>and the person has complied with all other provisions of law.\u201d (Emphasis added). Were we to assume that repayment of the reinstatement fee was required before a period of suspension or revocation terminated, as the Commonwealth contends, this provision would be meaningless. The Commissioner could never relieve an individual of paying the reinstatement fee after \u201cthree years have elapsed from the termination of the date of the order of suspension or revocation,\u201d if the period of suspension or revocation terminated only upon payment of the fee.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-6\">Our construction of the relevant statutory texts causes us to conclude that a period of suspension or revocation terminates independent of reinstatement or renewal of one\u2019s driver\u2019s license. Thus, we find that appellant\u2019s failure to reapply for a new license or formally become a reinstated licensee did not extend the periods of his suspension or revocation, as argued by the Commonwealth. Accordingly, we hold that the evidence was insufficient to prove that appellant drove a motor vehicle on any highway in the Commonwealth before \u201cthe period of [his] suspension or revocation ha[d] terminated.\u201d Code \u00a7 46.2-301(B). We therefore reverse appellant\u2019s conviction for driving on a suspended or revoked license in violation of Code \u00a7 46.2-301(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b756-7\">Because we hold that the evidence was insufficient to prove that appellant drove a vehicle in violation of any existing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"711\">*711</page-number>period of suspension or revocation, we reverse the trial court\u2019s conviction of appellant under Code \u00a7 46.2-301(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b757-5\">\n<em>Reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b748-10\">.

Because appellant\u2019s numerous suspensions were largely coterminous, we refer throughout this opinion to a singular period of suspension rather than multiple, overlapping periods of suspension.

The Commonwealth cites also to Code \u00a7 46.2-411.1, which requires \"written confirmation\" that the person whose license was suspended or revoked as a result of a conviction for driving while intoxicated \"successfully completed\" an alcohol safety action program, and Code \u00a7 46.2-412, which provides, in relevant part, that \u201c[e]very suspension or revocation shall remain in effect and the Commissioner shall not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"706\">*706</page-number>issue any new or renewal license ... until permitted under the provisions of [Chapter 3 \u2014 Licensure of Drivers].\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b754-7\">. The Commonwealth contests this point, asserting \"that a suspension or revocation does not end automatically by operation of law, but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"709\">*709</page-number>instead continues until a new license is applied for and issued.\u201d Commonwealth\u2019s Br. at 8. In support of this contention the Commonwealth cites <em>Sears v. Commonwealth, </em>29 Va.App. 158, 510 S.E.2d 274 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b755-7\">We find the Commonwealth's reliance on <em>Sears </em>misplaced. In <em>Sears, </em>which concerned the habitual offender statute in place at that time, we concluded that a defendant's privilege to drive was not automatically restored simply \"by the passage of the revocation period,\u201d because the court order suspending the defendant\u2019s privilege to drive expressly prohibited the defendant from driving \"for a period of ten (10) years ... <em>and until [defendant\u2019s] privilege ... to operate a motor vehicle ... ha[d] been restored by [a court of record].\" Id. </em>at 161, 510 S.E.2d at 275 (emphasis added).
