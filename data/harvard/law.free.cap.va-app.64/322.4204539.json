He argues that the Commonwealth failed to present sufficient evidence to prove that he did anything other than sign three summonses with a false name. The appellant suggests that his actions did not constitute utterings under Virginia law because the evidence failed to prove that he acted with the \u201cpurpose of obtaining the [object] mentioned\u201d in the summonses. We hold that the evidence was sufficient to prove that the appellant uttered public records. Specifically, the record supports the conclusion that the appellant, through his actions, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>asserted that his false signatures on the summonses were good and valid. These actions were sufficient to prove uttering. Therefore, we affirm the convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-4\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b370-5\">On appeal of a challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence, this Court views the record in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, the prevailing party at trial. <em>Stevenson v. Commonwealth, </em>258 Va. 485, 488, 522 S.E.2d 368, 368 (1999); <em>Henry v. Commonwealth, </em>63 Va.App. 30, 35, 753 S.E.2d 868, 870 (2014). To do so, we \u201c \u2018discard all evidence of the accused that conflicts with that of the Commonwealth.\u2019 \u201d <em>Henry, </em>63 Va.App. at 37, 753 S.E.2d at 871 (quoting <em>Holcomb v. Commonwealth, </em>58 Va.App. 339, 346, 709 S.E.2d 711, 714 (2011)). The Court also accepts as true all the credible evidence favorable to the prosecution as well as all fair inferences in support of the conviction that may be drawn from the record. <em>Id. </em>Viewed under this standard, the evidence is as follows.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-6\">On November 8, 2012, Deputy Scott Craig of the Augusta County Sheriffs Department stopped the appellant\u2019s vehicle for a speeding violation. Before Deputy Craig approached the automobile, the appellant, who was driving, got out of the car. The appellant turned, placed his hands behind his back, and announced that he did not have a driver\u2019s license.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-7\">The deputy assured him that driving without a license did not necessarily warrant an arrest. The appellant identified himself as Christopher Venable, stated that he was from New York, and provided Deputy Craig with a date of birth and social security number. Due to technical difficulties with equipment, Craig was unable to verify the out of state information with dispatch.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-8\">The deputy issued three summonses to the appellant in the name of Christopher Venable for speeding, driving without an operator\u2019s license, and failure to wear a seatbelt. The appellant signed the summonses as \u201cChristopher Venable\u201d and returned them to Deputy Craig. He signed each document below two pre-printed sentences: \u201cI promise to appear at the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>time and place shown above, signing this summons is not an admission of guilt. I certify that my current mailing address is as shown below.\u201d Two of the documents included \u201cchecked\u201d boxes informing the recipient that he could avoid going to court if he followed the accompanying instructions.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-5\">Over a month later, Deputy Craig learned the appellant\u2019s true identity. The appellant had represented himself as Christopher Venable during a separate encounter with Officer Robert Dean of the Waynesboro Police Department. When Dean saw the name Christopher Venable on a recent record, he contacted Deputy Craig and provided the deputy with the appellant\u2019s actual name.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-6\">At the completion of the Commonwealth\u2019s case, the appellant moved to strike the uttering charges, alleging that the evidence was insufficient to support them. He argued that the Commonwealth failed to prove that he sought to obtain an \u201cobject mentioned in the [forged] writing.\u201d The court denied the motion. During closing arguments, the appellant renewed the motion. The trial court again denied the motion, holding that the forgeries were \u201cthe signature[s] of Christopher Venable.\u201d The court further explained that the appellant \u201cintended to have the officer believe that\u201d he was Christopher Venable \u201cand handed [them] back with that false impression\u201d and \u201cthat was the object of his uttering.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b371-7\">The court convicted the appellant of three counts of uttering a public record, in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-168.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> He was sentenced to a total of nine years in prison for these offenses, with eight years suspended.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-8\">II. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b371-9\">The appellant argues that the evidence was insufficient to prove uttering.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Relying on <em>Bennett v. Commonwealth, </em>48 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>Va.App. 354, 357, 631 S.E.2d 332, 333 (2006), he suggests that an uttering occurs only when the act was \u201cmade in the prosecution of the purpose of obtaining the [object] mentioned in the said writing.\u201d The Commonwealth responds that \u201cuttering,\u201d as used in the statute at issue, is complete upon proof of \u201can assertion by word or action that a writing known to be forged is good and valid.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b372-5\">The relevant facts are not in dispute. Rather, the question in this appeal is whether the facts of this case meet the definition of \u201cuttering\u201d under Code \u00a7 18.2-168. In order to resolve this issue, we must determine the applicable definition of \u201cuttering,\u201d and then review the relevant evidence supporting the appellant\u2019s convictions to ascertain whether it was sufficient to prove that he uttered the forged summonses.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b372-6\">\n<em>A. Meaning of Uttering for Purposes of the Statute</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b372-7\">The interpretation of a statute is a question of law which this Court reviews <em>de novo </em>on appeal. <em>Baker v. Commonwealth, </em>278 Va. 656, 660, 685 S.E.2d 661, 663 (2009); <em>Belew v. Commonwealth, </em>62 Va.App. 55, 62, 741 S.E.2d 800, 803 (2013). Generally, an undefined statutory term \u201c \u2018must be given its ordinary meaning, given the context in which it is used.\u2019 \u201d <em>Lawlor v. Commonwealth, </em>285 Va. 187, 237, 738 S.E.2d 847, 875 (2013) (quoting <em>Meeks v. Commonwealth, </em>274 Va. 798, 802, 651 S.E.2d 637, 639 (2007)).</p>\n<p id=\"b372-8\">Code \u00a7 18.2-168, in pertinent part, forbids \u201cany person [from] forg[ing] a public record ... or [from] utter[ing], or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>attempting] to employ as true, such forged record ... knowing the same to be forged.\u201d The code section prohibits two distinct offenses: forging a public record and uttering, or attempting to employ as true, the forged record.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>Bennett, </em>48 Va.App. at 357, 631 S.E.2d at 333; <em>see also Bateman v. Commonwealth, </em>205 Va. 595, 599, 139 S.E.2d 102, 105 (1964) (holding that Code \u00a7 18.1-96 (1960), the precursor to Code \u00a7 18.2-172, \u201clist[ed] two offenses in the disjunctive: one, forgery, and the other, uttering or attempting to employ as true a forged writing\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b373-5\">The Supreme Court of Virginia considered the definition of \u201cuttering\u201d in <em>Bateman, </em>205 Va. 595, 139 S.E.2d 102. The Court referenced <em>Black\u2019s Law </em>Dictionary\u2019s entry on uttering, \u201c \u2018[t]o put or send [as a forged check] into circulation[;] ... to utter and publish.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 599-600, 139 S.E.2d at 106 (first and second alterations in original) (quoting <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>1716 (4th ed.1957)). <em>See generally Elliott v. Commonwealth, </em>277 Va. 457, 463, 675 S.E.2d 178, 182 (2009) (\u201cWhen the language of a statute is unambiguous, courts are bound by the plain meaning of that language and may not assign a construction that amounts to holding that the General Assembly did not mean what it actually has stated.\u201d). The Court ultimately defined an uttering as \u201can assertion by word or action that a writing known to be forged is good and valid.\u201d <em>Bateman, </em>205 Va. at 600, 139 S.E.2d at 106.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-6\">In <em>Bennett, </em>this Court applied the definition of uttering provided in <em>Bateman </em>in the context of Code \u00a7 18.2-168. <em>Bennett, </em>48 Va.App. at 357, 631 S.E.2d at 333. Bennett had submitted an application for a driver\u2019s license under an alias. <em>Id. </em>During the application process, he signed a false name on \u201ca computer screen bearing his digitalized image.\u201d <em>Id. </em>On appeal, Bennett argued that the single act of signing the false name could not constitute both a forgery and an uttering of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>public record, because he did not \u201cput the forged document into circulation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 358, 631 S.E.2d at 333. This Court rejected that notion and explained that the forged document \u201c \u2018is uttered when it is offered to another as genuine, without regard to whether it is so accepted.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting 4 Charles E. Torcia, <em>Wharton\u2019s Criminal Law </em>\u00a7 496 (15th ed.1996)). The Court further made clear that there was \u201cno requirement that a forged instrument be negotiated.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 358, 631 S.E.2d at 334. The opinion adopted the definition of uttering provided in <em>Bateman, </em>\u201c \u2018an assertion by word or action that a writing known to be forged is good and valid.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 357, 631 S.E.2d at 333 (quoting <em>Bateman, </em>205 Va. at 600, 139 S.E.2d at 106). The Court reasoned that the act of signing was an assertion to the Department of Motor Vehicles agent that the false name was \u201cgood and valid.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 358, 631 S.E.2d at 334. The signing triggered the production of the fraudulent license and, therefore, simultaneously constituted a forgery and an uttering. <em>Id. </em>Thus, both the definition applied in <em>Bennett </em>and its ultimate holding are consistent with <em>Bateman.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b374-5\">The appellant cites specific language in <em>Bennett </em>as controlling. The <em>Bennett </em>opinion does, as the appellant suggests, include language that an uttering is comprised of an assertion that a forged writing is true if the assertion \u201c \u2018was made in the prosecution of the purpose of obtaining the [object] mentioned in the said writing.\u2019 \u201d 48 Va.App. at 357, 631 S.E.2d at 333 (alteration in original) (quoting <em>Sands v. Commonwealth, </em>61 Va. (20 Gratt.) 800, 823-24 (1871)).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The appellant contends <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>that this language signifies that in order for an action to constitute an uttering, it not only must be an assertion that a forged writing is good and valid, the action must also be done in pursuit of a goal specifically mentioned in the forged document. A full reading of the opinion, however, demonstrates that the actual analysis did not consider the purpose stated in the writing to which the defendant affixed his false signature.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-5\">The reference to the purpose mentioned in the writing was \u201cnot essential to the Court\u2019s judgment\u201d in <em>Bennett </em>and, as such, \u201cis unbinding dicta.\u201d <em>Sarafin v. Commonwealth, </em>\u2014 Va. -, -, 764 S.E.2d 71, 77 (2014). In other words, the language relied upon by the appellant does not bind this Court. <em>See, e.g., Cooper v. Commonwealth, </em>54 Va.App. 558, 571, 680 S.E.2d 361, 367-68 (2009) (explaining that dicta can be persuasive but is not controlling). Consequently, while the <em>Bennett </em>holding is instructive and consistent with the common definition of uttering, it compels a result contrary to the appellant\u2019s argument. We decline to hold, as the appellant suggests, that an uttering occurs <em>only </em>when the action is done in pursuit of a purpose specifically mentioned in the forged writing.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-8\">Our conclusion that <em>Bennett </em>did not place an additional requirement on the general statutory meaning of \u201cuttering\u201d and, instead, applied the common definition, is supported by <em>Bateman </em>and the many Virginia appellate opinions that reviewed uttering convictions <em>without </em>discussing the \u201cpurpose of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>obtaining the object mentioned\u201d in the forged writing. <em>See, e.g., Oliver v. Commonwealth, </em>35 Va.App. 286, 295-96, 544 S.E.2d 870, 874-75 (2001) (affirming uttering conviction under Code \u00a7 18.2-172); <em>Dillard v. Commonwealth, </em>32 Va.App. 515, 519, 529 S.E.2d 325, 327 (2000) (analyzing sufficiency of the evidence to support convictions for forging and uttering a check); <em>Ramsey v. Commonwealth, 2 </em>Va.App. 265, 269-70, 343 S.E.2d 465, 468-69 (1986) (affirming conviction for uttering a forged check); <em>see also </em>Va. Model Jury Inst.-Crim. Inst. No. G30.300. Based upon this Court\u2019s <em>de novo </em>review of the statute, we hold that in order to sustain the convictions for uttering under Code \u00a7 18.2-168, the Commonwealth was required to prove that the appellant knew that the writings were forged, yet asserted that they were \u201cgood and valid.\u201d We next review whether the evidence supporting the uttering convictions was sufficient to prove that the appellant\u2019s actions met this definition.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-4\">\n<em>B. Sufficiency of the Evidence</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b376-5\">When considering a challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence, we must affirm the decision below unless the trial court\u2019s decision was plainly wrong or lacked evidence to support it. <em>See, e.g., Allison v. Commonwealth, </em>207 Va. 810, 811, 153 S.E.2d 201, 202 (1967); <em>Henry, </em>63 Va.App. at 37, 753 S.E.2d at 871. In our review of the record, we accord the trial court\u2019s factual determinations \u201cgreat deference.\u201d <em>See, e.g., Towler v. Commonwealth, </em>59 Va.App. 284, 297, 718 S.E.2d 463, 470 (2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b376-6\">During a routine traffic stop, the appellant identified himself as Christopher Venable to Deputy Craig. The appellant told the deputy that he was from New York and provided him with a date of birth and social security number. Based on the appellant\u2019s representations, the deputy issued three summonses to the appellant under the name of Christopher Venable. The appellant signed the summonses as \u201cChristopher Venable\u201d and returned them to Deputy Craig. The trial court found that the appellant uttered the forged summonses when he handed them back to Deputy Craig with the intent to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>convey that the false signatures were true. Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, the record supports the reasonable conclusion that, through his actions, the appellant asserted that his forged name was true and that the forged summonses were good and valid. Thus, the trial court\u2019s finding was not plainly wrong, and the convictions were supported by the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-5\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b377-6\">We hold that the definition of uttering is \u201can assertion by word or action that a writing known to be forged is good and valid.\u201d <em>Bateman, </em>205 Va. at 600, 139 S.E.2d at 106. Under this definition, the evidence was sufficient for the trial court to conclude that the appellant uttered the summonses. Therefore, we affirm the convictions for uttering a public record.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b371-10\">. The appellant\u2019s convictions for forging public records are not challenged in this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b371-11\">. The appellant does not contest that the traffic summonses are public records. <em>See Rodriquez v. Commonwealth, </em>50 Va.App. 667, 671, 653 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>S.E.2d 296, 298 (2007) (holding that the summonses issued to the defendant were \"public records\u201d under Code \u00a7 18.2-168).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b372-10\">. We do not consider the Commonwealth\u2019s contention that under Rule 5A:18, the appellant procedurally defaulted any argument that the evidence was insufficient to prove that he made the requisite assertion because Deputy Craig took the documents from him. <em>See </em>Rule 5A:18 (\"No ruling of the trial court ... will be considered as a basis for reversal unless an objection was stated with reasonable certainty at the time of the ruling____\u201d). Although the Commonwealth\u2019s point that the appellant did not raise this issue below is well founded, the appellant acknowledged at oral argument that he did not intend to raise that argument on brief. (Oral Argument Audio at 22:52).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b373-7\">. A separate statute, Code \u00a7 18.2-172, prohibits the forgery and uttering of instruments other than public records and currency. <em>See, e.g., Beiler v. Commonwealth, </em>243 Va. 291, 415 S.E.2d 849 (1992) (affirming convictions under Code \u00a7 18.2-172 for forging and uttering two checks).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b374-6\">. In <em>Sands, </em>the case from which the <em>Bennett </em>language cited by the appellant originated, the Supreme Court of Virginia reviewed convictions for forging and uttering a written document. The language from <em>Sands </em>that the jury should have been instructed that an assertion \"is an uttering ... provided that [it] was made in the prosecution of the purpose of obtaining the money mentioned in said writing\u201d has no application here because the case dealt with a jury instruction specific to the Commonwealth's theory of guilt charged in the indictment. <em>Sands, </em>61 Va. (20 Gratt.) at 823-24; <em>see also Cooper v. Commonwealth, </em>2 Va.App. 497, 500, 345 S.E.2d 775, 777 (1986) (noting that jury instructions should inform the jury \" 'as to the law of the case applicable to the facts\u2019 \u201d (quoting 75 Am.Jur.2d <em>Trial </em>\u00a7 573 (1974))); <em>cf. Shaikh v. Johnson, </em>276 Va. 537, 546, 666 S.E.2d 325, 329 (2008) (cautioning <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>against using language from an appellate opinion in jury instructions). Further, <em>Sands </em>involved an uttering of a private financial document, not a public record. <em>Sands, </em>61 Va. (20 Gratt.) at 823-24. Applying <em>Sands </em>to Code \u00a7 18.2-168 would be at odds with the statutory language because that language specifically encompasses the forgery and uttering of \"public documents.\u201d The statute is written to include all public documents, not exclusively documents with writing pertaining to money. Indeed, <em>Bateman, </em>which also involved money and was decided ninety-three years after <em>Sands, </em>did not even cite the <em>Sands </em>case or the expanded language relied upon by the appellant. <em>Bateman, </em>205 Va. at 599-600, 139 S.E.2d at 105-06 (reviewing convictions for uttering forged checks).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
