Commonwealth, </em>275 Va. 144, 148, 654 S.E.2d 584, 586 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b698-12\">Appellant shot the victim in the abdomen with a .45 caliber Glock pistol. The bullet caused a \u201cthrough and through\u201d wound, entering and exiting the victim\u2019s abdomen. As a result of the shooting, the victim had surgery in his abdominal area, and he was hospitalized for two weeks.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"653\">*653</page-number>At trial, the victim showed the two bullet holes to the jury. The record indicates he pointed to a wound located above his right hip and a wound located on the lower left quadrant of his abdomen. In addition, the victim exhibited the surgical scar to the jury. The trial court described the sear as follows.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A4d\">The scar is a thick scar. This is not a hairline scar, this is a thick scar, half-inch wide. Midline surgical incision goes below his sternum, down to his navel. It curves around his navel and then goes a couple of inches, two, three inches down below his navel____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b699-5\">The trial court also stated the scar was \u201cvery clear and obvious\u201d eleven months after the injury, and the \u201cpoints\u201d where the staples or sutures entered the victim\u2019s skin were still visible at the time of trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-6\">The Commonwealth presented no medical evidence. On cross-examination, the victim agreed that after the shooting, he is able to do all the physical activities he could perform prior to the shooting. When asked by the trial court if he had any \u201cdisabilities from the shooting,\u201d appellant replied, \u201cNo, Sir, I mean I have ... sometimes, every now and then, stomach pain as far as that.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b699-7\">At the conclusion of the evidence, appellant made a motion to strike the aggravated portion of the charge. Appellant asserted that the bullet he fired did not cause the large sear, rather the surgery caused the scar. Appellant concluded he could not be held responsible for causing the surgical scar, the injury that the Commonwealth relied upon as proof that appellant committed aggravated malicious wounding.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-8\">The trial court denied the motion to strike, ruling:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b699-9\">WTien you get a gunshot wound that goes from one side of your pelvis to the other side of the pelvis, it\u2019s going to cause some kind of injury and the surgery has to be done. [The] surgical incision was obviously directly related to that and that significant surgical scar is sufficient for the Commonwealth to proceed on the charge of aggravated malicious wounding.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b700-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"654\">*654</page-number>\n<em>Analysis</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b700-4\">In ruling on a defendant\u2019s motion to strike the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence, a trial court must view that evidence in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth. <em>Cirios v. Commonwealth, </em>7 Va.App. 292, 298, 373 S.E.2d 164, 167 (1988). A motion to strike tests the legal sufficiency of the evidence. <em>See </em>Rule 3A:15.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-5\">Code \u00a7 18.2-51.2(A), the statute defining aggravated malicious wounding, provides in pertinent part: \u201cIf any person maliciously shoots ... any other person ... with the intent to maim, disfigure, disable or kill, he shall be guilty of a Class 2 felony if the victim is thereby severely injured and is caused to suffer permanent and significant physical impairment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b700-6\">Appellant does not deny that he fired the bullet that entered and exited the victim\u2019s abdomen. Appellant does not deny that the surgical scar is a permanent and significant physical impairment pursuant to Code \u00a7 18.2-51.2. Appellant\u2019s Brief at 3. <em>See also Newton v. Commonwealth, </em>21 Va.App. 86, 90, 462 S.E.2d 117, 119 (1995) (scars caused by defendant cutting victim with a box cutter visible after five months constituted \u201cpermanent and significant physical impairment\u201d). Rather, appellant maintains that the scar is attributable to the surgery and not to his shooting the victim. Appellant asserts that a fair reading of Code \u00a7 18.2-51.2 \u201cshows that the statute criminalizes acts which are attributable to\u201d appellant, and appellant did not \u201cdirectly\u201d cause the surgical scar.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-7\">When analyzing the offense of aggravated malicious wounding, it has been stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b700-8\">The impairment must be caused by the defendant. Presumably, as in homicide, there is both a cause-in-fact and proximate causation issue. The latter is obviously the more difficult. The rules applicable in homicide cases are probably transferrable so that if the defendant had the appropriate mental state and did the appropriate act, and the impairing outcome was foreseeable, he should be convicted. So if a victim with a preexisting weakness is maliciously shot by a defendant who intends to kill and the combination <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"655\">*655</page-number>of weakness and injury produces impairment, the impairment is foreseeable and proximately caused by the defendant.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b701-5\">Ronald J. Bacigal, <em>Criminal Offenses and Defenses </em>56 (2014).</p>\n<p id=\"b701-6\">Therefore, in addressing appellant\u2019s argument, we consider the principles of causation. Causation is circumscribed by reasonably foreseeable consequences of an act. The concept of proximate causation is \u201capplicable in both civil and criminal cases.\u201d <em>Brown v. Commonwealth, </em>278 Va. 523, 529, 685 S.E.2d 43, 46 (2009) (citing <em>Robinson v. Commonwealth, </em>274 Va. 45, 53, 645 S.E.2d 470, 474 (2007)). \u201cA proximate cause is \u2018an act or omission that, in natural and continuous sequence unbroken by a superseding cause, produces a particular event and without which that event would not have occurred.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Williams v. Joynes, </em>278 Va. 57, 62, 677 S.E.2d 261, 264 (2009)). \u201c\u2018An intervening act which is reasonably foreseeable cannot be relied upon as breaking the chain of causal connection between an original act of negligence and subsequent injury.\u2019 \u201d <em>Gallimore v. Commonwealth, </em>246 Va. 441, 447, 436 S.E.2d 421, 425 (1993) (quoting <em>Delawder v. Commonwealth, </em>214 Va. 55, 58, 196 S.E.2d 913, 915 (1973)). Furthermore, \u201can intervening event, even if a cause of the harm, does not operate to exempt a defendant from liability if the intervening event was put into operation by the defendant\u2019s negligent acts.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b701-7\">\u201c \u2018Generally, negligence (whether ordinary, gross, or willful and wanton), contributory negligence, and proximate cause are issues for a jury\u2019s resolution. They only become questions of law to be determined by a court, when reasonable minds could not differ.\u2019 \u201d <em>Forbes v. Commonwealth, </em>27 Va.App. 304, 309, 498 S.E.2d 457, 459 (1998) (quoting <em>Tubman v. Commonwealth, </em>3 Va.App. 267, 273-74, 348 S.E.2d 871, 875 (1986)).</p>\n<p id=\"b701-8\">Applying these principles to appellant\u2019s case, we cannot say the trial court erred by denying appellant\u2019s motion to strike the aggravated malicious wounding charge. Appellant shot the victim in the abdomen with a .45 caliber Glock pistol. But <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"656\">*656</page-number>for appellant shooting the victim, the victim would not have had abdominal surgery resulting in the large scar, a permanent and significant physical impairment. In addition, the surgery did not relieve appellant from liability or break the chain of the causal connection between the shooting and the scar because the surgery was a reasonably foreseeable consequence of the shooting.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-4\">As the Supreme Court has stated in the context of a murder conviction:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b702-5\">When a defendant has inflicted wounds upon a victim that result in an affliction or a disease, the defendant is criminally responsible for the victim\u2019s death from that affliction or disease if the wounds caused the death indirectly through a chain of natural effects and causes. An intervening event, even if a cause of death, does not exempt the defendant from liability if that event was put into operation by the defendant\u2019s initial criminal acts.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b702-6\"><em>Commonwealth v. Jenkins, </em>255 Va. 516, 521, 499 S.E.2d 263, 265-66 (1998) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b702-7\">In <em>Jenkins, </em>the defendant shot the victim and the victim received medical treatment in the hospital. Four days later, the victim died while still in the hospital. The medical examiner testified the victim \u201c \u2018died as a result of [the] aspiration following the gunshot wound to the abdomen.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 518, 499 S.E.2d at 264. Other evidence indicated \u201cmany factors\u201d contributed to the victim\u2019s death \u201cbut all were\u201d the result of the gunshot wound. <em>Id. </em>at 521, 499 S.E.2d at 266. The Court found the evidence was sufficient to prove \u201cthe required causal connection between Jenkins\u2019 acts and the victim\u2019s death.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b702-8\">We also find the analysis in <em>Brown </em>is instructive here. In <em>Brown, </em>the defendant was convicted of involuntary manslaughter where, during a high-speed chase of Brown, a police officer\u2019s vehicle struck another vehicle, killing that driver, the victim. Brown argued his actions did not directly cause the death of the victim, but rather the victim died \u201csolely because\u201d the officer conducted a high-speed chase into a populated area. <em>Brown, </em>278 Va. at 527, 685 S.E.2d at 45. The Court found the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"657\">*657</page-number>high-speed chase was \u201ca direct result of Brown\u2019s reckless driving\u201d and his decision to flee. <em>Id. </em>at 530, 685 S.E.2d at 47. Furthermore, the Court found Brown\u2019s actions \u201c \u2018put into operation\u2019 \u201d the high-speed chase, thus, Brown was responsible for the victim\u2019s death and Brown\u2019s conduct \u201cwas a cause without which [the victim]\u2019s death would not have occurred.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b703-5\">Similarly, here, appellant\u2019s shooting of the victim \u201cput into operation\u201d the victim\u2019s need for surgery, and appellant\u2019s conduct was a cause \u201cwithout which\u201d the victim\u2019s surgery and resulting surgical scar would not have occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-6\">We find additional support for our conclusion in <em>State v. Anderson, </em>370 N.W.2d 703 (Minn.Ct.App.1985), in which the court found the defendant responsible for causing a surgical scar where the defendant\u2019s actions caused the need for the surgery. In Anderson, the defendant was convicted of assault in the first degree, which was defined as assaulting another and inflicting great bodily harm. Id. at 705. \u201cGreat bodily harm\u201d was defined, in part, as: \u201cBodily injury which ... causes serious permanent disfigurement.... \u201d Id. (quoting Minn.Stat. \u00a7 609.02, subd. 8 (1982)).</p>\n<p id=\"b703-7\">In Anderson, the evidence showed the defendant kicked and \u201cstamped on\u201d the victim\u2019s stomach area, resulting in a lacerated liver. Surgical repair of that internal laceration created a scar. Id. Despite the fact that the defendant did not inflict the surgical incision that created the scar, the court held the evidence was sufficient for the jury to find the surgical scar constituted \u201cserious and permanent disfigurement.\u201d Id. at 706.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-8\">We conclude the trial court did not err in denying appellant\u2019s motion to strike the evidence because the Commonwealth presented a prima facie case for consideration by the fact finder. Accordingly, we affirm appellant\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-9\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b698-13\">. Appellant was also convicted of two counts of use of a firearm in the commission of a felony, malicious wounding, and three counts of shooting into an occupied vehicle. However, he challenges only the aggravated malicious wounding conviction on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
