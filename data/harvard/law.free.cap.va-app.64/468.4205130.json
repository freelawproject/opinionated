Abdo appeals from a conviction of criminal contempt. He argues that (1) the evidence does not establish that he possessed the requisite intent for conviction; (2) the circuit court erroneously refused to apply <em>Singleton v. Commonwealth, </em>278 Va. 542, 685 S.E.2d 668 (2009), to a police officer; and (3) the circuit court erred in considering prior unadjudicated acts. We find no error and affirm the decision of the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-6\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b517-7\">Appellant is a police officer for the Town of Remington, in Fauquier County. On November 22, 2013, he had scheduled several cases on the town traffic docket. He was not present in the courthouse when the cases were called. The general district court granted the Commonwealth\u2019s motion for a <em>nolle prosequi </em>Appellant arrived nine minutes late, after the court had granted the \u201cnol pros.\u201d The court issued a show cause order for appellant to explain why he should not be held in contempt.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-8\">At the contempt hearing, appellant apologized for his tardiness and \u201ctendered a reason for his non-appearance,\u201d which the court found unsatisfactory. The court noted that appellant had \u201con several occasions, failed to appear or appeared late\u201d and that \u201c[t]his ha[d] routinely resulted in the <em>nolle prosequi </em>of his cases.\u201d In its written order, the general district court recounted three prior instances of tardiness. On the first such occasion, appellant tendered a handwritten apology, in which he stated that he had \u201coverslept and have no other excuse. It will not happen again.\u201d Another time, appellant explained that his vehicle had broken down. In a later instance of tardiness, he stated that \u201chis wife had taken his car, which had his copies of the summonses he wrote for court that day.\u201d The general district court observed that, \u201c[o]n none of these occasions, either the ones for which he offered an excuse or the others for which no excuse was offered, did the court issue any contempt process against Officer Abdo after receiving an apology and further assur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>anees of timely attendance to his court obligations.\u201d The court concluded that \u201c[t]his recurring misbehavior by a law enforcement officer cannot be ignored by the court, lest it send a message that such conduct will be countenanced.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b518-4\">Based on the evidence and the testimony presented at the hearing, the general district court found appellant in contempt and imposed a $25 fine, which the court suspended upon twelve months of good behavior. The general district court prepared a certificate of conviction based on Code \u00a7 18.2-459 memorializing the court\u2019s rationale for finding appellant in contempt.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-5\">Appellant appealed this decision to circuit court. In addition to the certificate, the circuit court received stipulated evidence that, on November 22, 2013, appellant called another police officer, Officer Bryan Reese, and asked him to inform the court that appellant would be running a few minutes late. Officer Reese testified that, at 9:00 a.m., he informed the general district court judge that appellant was running late. Appellant also testified and explained that his tardiness was inadvertent and that he had no intent to delay, obstruct, or harass the proceedings of the general district court. He stated that he was late because \u201chis wife had taken the vehicle that contained his paperwork for the cases on that morning\u2019s docket.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b518-6\">The circuit court found appellant guilty of contempt and imposed a $25 fine, which the court suspended. The court observed that, \u201cif this were the first time the defendant had been late to court, its ruling would be different; but because of the previous instances set out in the Certificate of Conviction, it found the defendant guilty as charged.\u201d Appellant moved to set aside this order or stay the sentence\u2019s execution. The circuit court denied that motion. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-7\">ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b518-8\">I. Instances of Appellant\u2019s past tardiness were relevant AND ADMISSIBLE.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-10\">At the outset, we examine whether the circuit court properly admitted evidence of appellant\u2019s previous instances of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>tardiness.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Appellant argues that the court cannot consider such \u201cprior unadjudicated acts,\u201d which were \u201cused for the impermissible purpose of suggesting criminal propensity.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b519-5\">\u201cThe admissibility of evidence is within the broad discretion of the trial court, and a ruling will not be disturbed on appeal in the absence of an abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>Blain v. Commonwealth, </em>7 Va.App. 10, 16, 371 S.E.2d 838, 842 (1988). As a general proposition, evidence of prior crimes or bad acts is inadmissible to prove that the accused committed the crime charged. <em>See Wilson v. Commonwealth, </em>16 Va.App. 213, 220, 429 S.E.2d 229, 233 (1993). This general rule, however, \u201c \u2018must sometimes yield to society\u2019s interest in the truth-finding process,\u2019 and numerous exceptions allow evidence of prior misconduct \u2018whenever the legitimate probative value outweighs the incidental prejudice to the accused.\u2019 \u201d <em>Wilkins v. Commonwealth, </em>18 Va.App. 293, 297, 443 S.E.2d 440, 443 (1994) (quoting <em>Lewis v. Commonwealth, </em>225 Va. 497, 502, 303 S.E.2d 890, 893 (1983)). Such evidence may be admitted if offered \u201cto prove any number of relevant facts, such as motive, intent, agency, or knowledge.\u201d <em>Wilson, </em>16 Va.App. at 220, 429 S.E.2d at 234.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-6\">Evidence of appellant\u2019s past tardiness was relevant on several grounds. First, it was relevant to establish his knowledge that being late would disrupt the court\u2019s docket. As the general district court noted, when appellant had been late in the past, his eases had to be <em>nolle prosequied </em>from the court\u2019s docket. Second, repeated affronts to the court\u2019s dignity are relevant in establishing intent. Prior warnings constitute evidence of willfulness when they go unheeded. For example, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>in <em>In re Marshall, </em>549 A.2d 311, 313 (D.C.1988) (per curiam), the appellant argued that the trial judge could not consider the prior occasions on which the defendant, an attorney, had been absent or late. The court held that the prior incidents were relevant to the critical issue of the attorney\u2019s willfulness in failing to appear in the instant case and, therefore, the trial court properly considered them as evidence of his contumacious intent. <em>Id. </em>Similarly, in <em>Thompson v. United States, </em>690 A.2d 479, 482 (D.C.1997) (quoting <em>Williams v. United States, </em>576 A.2d 1339, 1342 (D.C.1990)), the court observed that, \u201c \u2018[i]n order to hold a defendant in [criminal] contempt for appearing late, a court must find that the defendant behaved with willful, deliberate, or reckless disregard of the obligation to appear on time.\u2019 \u201d The court explained,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b520-5\">A wrongful intent is a state of mind, and in most cases it cannot be proved directly. Our case law makes it clear, however, that willfulness will not readily be inferred from isolated instances of late arrival. Where the defendant is a repeat offender, on the other hand, a finding that his conduct was willful has been sustained.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b520-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 483.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-7\">We do not hold that any instance of past misbehavior is relevant in contempt cases. Here, however, the behavior in question, being late for a court proceeding, was the very same misconduct that was at issue before the court. On these facts, the circuit court committed no abuse of discretion in considering appellant\u2019s past instances of tardiness.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b520-8\">II. Viewed in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, THE EVIDENCE IS SUFFICIENT FOR THE COURT TO FIND APPELLANT IN CONTEMPT.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-9\">\u201cWhere the court\u2019s authority to punish for contempt is exercised by a judgment rendered, its finding is presumed correct and will not be reversed unless plainly wrong or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>without evidence to support it.\u201d <em>Brown v. Commonwealth, </em>26 Va.App. 758, 762, 497 S.E.2d 147, 149 (1998). In considering a challenge to \u201cthe sufficiency of the evidence ..., we review the evidence in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, according it the benefit of all reasonable inferences fairly deducible therefrom.\u201d <em>Singleton v. Commonwealth, </em>278 Va. 542, 548, 685 S.E.2d 668, 671 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b521-5\">Appellant argues that he lacked the intent necessary for a finding of criminal contempt.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> \u201cIntent may, and most often must, be proven by circumstantial evidence and the reasonable inferences to be drawn from proven facts are within the province of the trier of fact.\u201d <em>Fleming v. Commonwealth, </em>13 Va.App. 349, 353, 412 S.E.2d 180, 183 (1991). \u201c \u2018Intent in fact is the purpose formed in a person\u2019s mind and may be, and frequently is, shown by circumstances. It is a state of mind which may be shown by a person\u2019s conduct or by his statements.\u2019 \u201d <em>Vincent v. Commonwealth, </em>276 Va. 648, 652-53, 668 S.E.2d 137, 140 (2008) (quoting <em>Hargrave v. Commonwealth, </em>214 Va. 436, 437, 201 S.E.2d 597, 598 (1974)). \u201cCircumstantial evidence is as acceptable to prove guilt as direct <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>evidence, and in some cases, such as proof of intent or knowledge, it is practically the <em>only </em>method of proof.\u201d <em>Parks v. Commonwealth, </em>221 Va. 492, 498, 270 S.E.2d 755, 759 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b522-4\">There is no question that \u201cthe element of intent\u201d must be present for a defendant to be found guilty of contempt. <em>Singleton, </em>278 Va. at 549, 685 S.E.2d at 672. Appellant states, without offering any supporting authority, that contempt <em>\u201cis </em>a specific-intent crime.\u201d We disagree. \u201cSpecific intent is the intent to accomplish the precise criminal act that one is later charged with.\u201d <em>Winston v. Commonwealth, </em>268 Va. 564, 600, 604 S.E.2d 21, 41 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b522-5\">The roots of the courts\u2019 contempt power run deep in the common law. <em>Carter v. Commonwealth, </em>96 Va. 791, 806, 32 S.E. 780, 782 (1899) (\u201cThat the English courts have exercised the power in question from the remotest period does not admit of doubt.\u201d). Despite this ancient pedigree, we can find no Virginia authority for the proposition that specific intent is necessary for a finding of contempt. New crimes at common law called for proof of specific intent. <em>See Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>931 (10th ed. 2014) (\u201cAt common law, the specific-intent crimes were robbery, assault, larceny, burglary, forgery, false pretenses, embezzlement, attempt, solicitation, and conspiracy.\u201d). Nor does the language of Code \u00a7 18.2-456(1) require specific intent. <em>See Johnson v. Commonwealth, </em>37 Va.App. 634, 640, 561 S.E.2d 1, 4 (2002) (\u201cSpecific intent ... must be explicitly found in the statute\u2019s language in order to establish such intent as an element of an offense.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b522-6\">Contempt under Virginia law is \u201c \u2018an act in disrespect of the court or its processes, or which obstructs the administration of justice, or tends to bring the court into disrepute.\u2019 \u201d <em>Robinson v. Commonwealth, </em>41 Va.App. 137, 142, 583 S.E.2d 60, 63 (2003) (quoting <em>Carter v. Commonwealth, </em>2 Va.App. 392, 396, 345 S.E.2d 5, 7 (1986)); <em>see also Burdett v. Commonwealth, </em>103 Va. 838, 843, 48 S.E. 878, 880 (1904) (\u201c \u2018Contempt of court is a disobedience to the court, or an opposing or despising the authority, justice or dignity thereof.\u2019 \u201d (quoting 2 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>R.T. Barton, <em>The Practice in the Courts of Law in Civil Cases </em>774 (2d ed.1892))). Professor Costello aptly observes that \u201c[c]ontempt is, itself, a frame of mind\u201d that consists in \u201can unwillingness to recognize the authority and dignity of the court.\u201d John L. Costello, <em>Virginia Criminal Law and Procedure </em>\u00a7 26.4(1] (4th ed.2014).</p>\n<p id=\"b523-5\">Under Virginia precedent, willfulness or recklessness satisfies the intent element necessary for a finding of criminal contempt. In <em>Carter, </em>we noted that a contempt conviction must be supported by evidence that \u201cthe contempt was committed <em>willfully.\u201d </em>2 Va.App. at 397, 345 S.E.2d at 8. In <em>Barrett v. Commonwealth, </em>268 Va. 170, 183, 597 S.E.2d 104, 111 (2004) (alterations in original) (quoting <em>United States v. Murdock, </em>290 U.S. 389, 394, 54 S.Ct. 223, 225, 78 L.Ed. 381 (1933)), the Supreme Court explained that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Av1\">\u201cThe word [willful] often denotes an act which is intentional, or knowing, or voluntary, as distinguished from accidental. But when used in a criminal statute it generally means an act done with a bad purpose; without justifiable excuse; stubbornly, obstinately, perversely[.] The word is also employed to characterize a thing done without ground for believing it is lawful.\u201d The term \u201cwillful act\u201d imports knowledge and consciousness that injury -will result from the act done. The act done must be intended or it must involve a reckless disregard for the rights of another and will probably result in an injury.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b523-6\">In <em>Robinson, </em>we observed that, \u201c[w]here an attorney schedules multiple matters in different jurisdictions at the same time, his assertions of good faith \u2018[d]o not negate the reasonable inference that he <em>recklessly or willfully </em>failed [timely] to advise the court of his conflicting schedule.\u2019 \u201d 41 Va.App. at 143, 583 S.E.2d at 63 (second and third alterations in original) (emphasis added) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b523-7\">Persuasive authority bolsters our conclusion that specific intent is not required and that willfulness or recklessness will support a finding of criminal contempt. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Allen, </em>587 F.3d 246, 256 (5th Cir.2009) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>(federal statute) (\u201cA conviction for criminal contempt requires both a \u2018contemptuous act and a willful, contumacious, or reckless state of mind.\u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>United States v. West, </em>21 F.3d 607, 608 (5th Cir.1994))); <em>United States v. Kouri-Perez, </em>187 F.3d 1, 8 (1st Cir.1999) (federal statute) (\u201c[T]he criminal contempt power is to be reserved for conduct that bespeaks a criminal <em>mens rea (ie., </em>intentional or reckless conduct).\u201d); <em>Williams, </em>576 A.2d at 1342 (\u201cIn order to hold a defendant in [criminal] contempt for appearing late, a court must find that the defendant behaved with willful, deliberate, or reckless disregard of the obligation to appear on time.\u201d); <em>People v. Ernest, </em>188 Ill.App.3d 987, 136 Ill.Dec. 500, 544 N.E.2d 1275, 1276 (1989) (\u201cSpecific intent is not a necessary predicate for criminal contempt.... In terms of common law analysis of <em>mens rea, </em>therefore, a general intent is all that is required. Thus, intent, knowledge, or recklessness will satisfy the <em>mens rea.\u201d).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b524-5\">Accordingly, willfulness or recklessness satisfies the intent required for a finding of criminal contempt.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> If specific intent were required, a court could not punish witnesses or attorneys whose chronic laziness or carelessness consistently thwarted the administration of justice, so long as the witness or attorney did not specifically intend to disrupt court proceedings. Such a view would seriously erode the authority of the courts to efficiently administer their dockets.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-6\">We conclude that the evidence, viewed in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, supports the circuit court\u2019s conclusion that appellant was guilty of criminal contempt. The fact that appellant contacted a fellow officer to inform the court that he would be late, as well as the fact that he was late by only nine minutes, <em>mitigate </em>the gravity of the offense but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>do not alter the fundamental problem: appellant was late without a valid excuse after repeated warnings to appear on time. Appellant\u2019s repeated tardiness not only disrupted court proceedings but also evidenced his willful and reckless disregard of the obligation to appear on time. Therefore, the circuit court did not err in finding the element of intent satisfied.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-5\">Appellant seeks to analogize his case to <em>Wise v. Commonwealth, </em>97 Va. 779, 34 S.E. 453 (1899). In that case, an attorney had scheduled two cases for trial on the same morning, one in Henrico County and the other in the City of Richmond. <em>Id. </em>at 780, 34 S.E. at 453. Upon discovering that he might be late, he communicated with the Henrico County Commonwealth\u2019s Attorney, who was at the courthouse, to inform the court of his concern. <em>Id. </em>He sought to continue the Richmond matter, but the trial court declined his request, and the court in Henrico held him in contempt for appearing late. <em>Id. </em>at 780-81, 34 S.E. at 453. The Supreme Court overturned the finding of contempt, concluding that the attorney had scheduled both cases \u201cin the reasonable expectation\u201d that the first case \u201cwould be completed in time to enable him to keep his appointment as counsel\u201d in the Henrico case. <em>Id. </em>at 781, 34 S.E. at 453. <em>Wise </em>is distinguishable. Here, appellant was not in a position of having to appear in two courts with the reasonable expectation that he would be able to conclude his first court appearance in sufficient time for him to appear on time for his second court appearance. Instead, he was late\u2014 again and again. In short, although contumacious intent was lacking in <em>Wise, </em>the facts support the conclusion that it was present here.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b526-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>Finally, appellant argues that the circuit court misapplied the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling in <em>Singleton. </em>In <em>Singleton, </em>two attorneys released their clients from appearing in court based on agreements with opposing counsel that the case should be continued. 278 Va. at 545, 547, 685 S.E.2d at 670, 671. One of the lawyers did not appear on the scheduled trial date. <em>Id. </em>at 545, 685 S.E.2d at 670. At that point, however, the court had not entered orders granting a continuance. <em>Id. </em>at 545, 547, 685 S.E.2d at 670-71. The trial court found the two attorneys guilty of contempt. <em>Id. </em>at 546, 547, 685 S.E.2d at 670, 671. The attorneys argued that their actions were not taken to obstruct or interrupt the administration of justice and that, instead, they reasonably expected the court to enter the mutually agreed continuance. <em>Id. </em>On appeal, the Supreme Court concluded that the evidence failed to establish an intent required for a conviction of contempt of court. <em>Id. </em>at 551, 685 S.E.2d at 673.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-5\">The circuit court\u2019s statement of proceedings in this case contains the following paragraph:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b526-6\">[TJhis Court noted that the <em>Singleton </em>case was inapposite for two reasons. First, it found that the defendants in <em>Singleton </em>were attorneys, not police officers. Second, the Court noted that <em>Singleton </em>did not fit the facts of this case because the lawyers in that case had called off their clients because of a prior agreement with a prosecutor for a continuance. The Court noted that if this were the first time the defendant had been late to court, its ruling would be different; but because of the previous instances set out in the Certificate of Conviction, it found the defendant guilty as charged.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b526-7\">Appellant characterizes this passage as encapsulating a ruling that \u201ca different standard applies to police officers (and presumably other witnesses) as compared with attorneys.\u201d We do not read the passage in this way. Rather, the court simply suggested a factual distinction between this case and the facts before the Court in <em>Singleton. </em>We agree with the circuit court that recurring lateness that disrupts the docket is different from the factual situation presented in <em>Singleton, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>where the lawyers anticipated the court would continue the case based on a mutual agreement of the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-5\">Certainly not every instance of tardiness will justify a finding of criminal contempt. The evidence here, however, supports the judgment of the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-6\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b527-7\">We affirm the judgment below.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-8\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b519-7\">. The Commonwealth argues that appellant has procedurally defaulted this issue under Rule 5A:18. Our jurisprudence requires us to seek \"the best and narrowest ground available\u201d for our decision. <em>Armstead v. Commonwealth, </em>56 Va.App. 569, 576, 695 S.E.2d 561, 564 (2010). In this case, resolution of the merits constitutes the best and narrowest ground. Accordingly, we decline to decide whether Rule 5A:18 precludes a litigant from raising on appeal a challenge to the admission of evidence by post-trial motion, in the context of a bench trial, when the Commonwealth does not object to the belated nature of the motion to exclude the evidence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b520-10\">. A contrary rule would provide a powerful disincentive for a court to exercise restraint when faced with conduct that justifies a sanction of contempt.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b521-6\">. The power to summarily punish direct contempt is more limited than the power to punish indirect contempt. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 18.2-456 (limiting the courts' power to summarily punish contempt to the instances listed in that statute). The circuit court did not hold appellant in direct contempt, and appellant does not argue that he was summarily punished. Appellant was convicted following notice and the opportunity to be heard. <em>See Scialdone v. </em>Commonwealth, 279 Va. 422, 442-43, 689 S.E.2d 716, 727-28 (2010) (explaining the difference between direct or summary contempt and indirect contempt). Confusingly, however, even though the court did not hold appellant in summary contempt, the circuit court\u2019s order cites the summary contempt statute, Code \u00a7 18.2-456. The court was not required, however, to restrict appellant\u2019s behavior into one of the subsections of Code \u00a7 18.2-456 because the court did not punish appellant summarily. The parties dispute which clause of Code \u00a7 18.2-456 the court employed for its finding of contempt. Upon review of the record, as the law of this case, we agree with appellant that the court relied on. subsection (1) of Code \u00a7 18.2-456. That subsection prohibits \u201cmisbehavior in the presence of the court, or so near thereto as to obstruct or interrupt the administration of justice.\u2019\u2019 Appellant's argument is that he did not have the intent to obstruct or interrupt the administration of justice and, therefore, he cannot be convicted under this provision.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b524-7\">. We acknowledge the holding of some courts that, when a defendant is charged with violating the terms of a court order, willfulness requires a specific intent to consciously disregard the order. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Lynch, </em>162 F.3d 732, 735 (2d Cir.1998); <em>see also Leisge v. Leisge, </em>224 Va. 303, 309, 296 S.E.2d 538, 541 (1982) (suggesting in dicta that criminal <em>contempt </em>for violating the terms of a court order requires specific intent). This case does not present such a scenario.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b525-6\">. In support of his argument that he lacked the requisite intent, appellant also relies on his own testimony \u2014 that his wife drove off in the car that contained his court papers. There is no indication that the circuit court accepted this version of events. \"The factfinder need not believe an accused's explanation and, if that explanation is' not believed, may infer that the accused is lying to conceal his guilt.\u201d <em>Phan v. Commonwealth, </em>258 Va. 506, 511, 521 S.E.2d 282, 284 (1999).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
