PETTY, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b85-13\">The Bristol Department of Social Services (DSS) and Patricia E. Smith, Guardian <em>ad litem, </em>appellants, appeal from the circuit court\u2019s denial of the petition to terminate the parental rights of Maggie S. Welch with respect to her minor child, C.W.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The appellants argue that the circuit court erred in: (1) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>delaying its decision regarding the termination of Welch\u2019s parental rights, (2) ignoring the statutory time frame in which the parent may remedy the conditions that led to foster care, and (3) failing to protect the best interests of the child. For the following reasons, we affirm in part and dismiss in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-4\">I. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b86-5\">On appeal, we view the evidence \u201cin the light most favorable to the prevailing party below and its evidence is afforded all reasonable inferences fairly deducible therefrom.\u201d <em>Logan v. Fairfax Cnty. Dep\u2019t of Human Dev., </em>13 Va.App. 123, 128, 409 S.E.2d 460, 462 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b86-6\">On December 26, 2010, DSS removed two children from Welch\u2019s care because of their suspicious injuries. Welch\u2019s three biological children, B.N.G., B.S.G., and C.W., were also removed from her care on that day. At the time of removal, B. N.G. was seven years old, B.S.G. was two years old, and C. W. was five months old.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-9\">On February 16, 2011, DSS prepared an initial foster care plan with the goal of returning C.W. to his own home within a year. DSS expressed concerns about returning C.W. and the other children to Welch\u2019s care because of her history of domestic violence with her husband and because of the trauma that the children suffered from witnessing the abusive relationship. DSS referred Welch to various services, including parenting classes, individual counseling, anger management classes, job searches and programs, parenting and psychological assessments, and visitations as scheduled by DSS.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-10\">Welch was arrested on federal charges on June 7, 2011. Welch pled guilty to drug conspiracy charges and the knowing use and carrying of a firearm in furtherance of a drug trafficking crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-11\">DSS prepared a revised foster care plan with the goal of adoption. DSS stated in the plan that Welch had refused <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>individual counseling and \u201ccontinued her lifestyle of drugs, dealing drugs, and remaining involved with convicted felons.\u201d On February 8, 2012, the juvenile and domestic relations district (JDR) court terminated Welch\u2019s residual parental rights to B.N.G., B.S.G., and C.W. Welch appealed to the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-4\">On May 8, 2012, the circuit court heard evidence on DSS\u2019s petitions to terminate Welch\u2019s residual parental rights to her three children. Welch testified that she had not resided with her husband since December 2010 and that her relationship with him was over.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-5\">On October 19, 2012, the circuit court terminated Welch\u2019s residual parental rights with respect to the two older children, B.N.G. and B.S.G. The circuit court found that B.N.G. was a special needs child and that B.S.G. \u201chas been diagnosed with Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, Developmental Coordination Disorder, anxious moods, and is asthmatic.\u201d This Court affirmed the circuit court\u2019s decisions regarding B.N.G. and B.S.G. by memorandum opinion dated May 21, 2013. The circuit court withheld its decision on the termination of Welch\u2019s residual parental rights with respect to C.W. until the outcome of Welch\u2019s federal sentencing hearing was known.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-6\">On November 8, 2012, Smith filed a motion requesting that the circuit court rule on the termination of Welch\u2019s residual parental rights with respect to C.W. The circuit court again reserved the decision regarding C.W., noting that Welch\u2019s anticipated release date from federal custody was July 28, 2013.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-7\">Smith and DSS filed a second motion, which was heard on September 5, 2013. Welch had been released from federal custody under terms and conditions. She was living at a halfway house and working at a nursing home. Welch testified that she would be eligible for release to house arrest in November 2013 and that she would continue her job at the nursing home. Welch stated that she had a trust fund to finance housing and support for herself and her child. Welch testified that she had not seen C.W. since February 2011. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>While incarcerated, Welch completed a parenting certificate and acted as a mentor to other inmates who suffered drug addiction. Both Welch and her father testified that he stood behind her during the entire period and that he would continue to support and assist her in the future.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-4\">The circuit court concluded that DSS failed to prove that terminating Welch\u2019s parental rights was in the best interests of C.W. On February 29, 2014 the circuit court entered a final order denying DSS\u2019s petition to terminate. These appeals followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-5\">II. Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b88-6\">A. Delay in Entering a Final Order</p>\n<p id=\"A6X\">First, the appellants argue that the circuit court violated C.W.\u2019s statutory right to expeditious review under Code \u00a7 16.1-296(D) by withholding judgment regarding the termination of Welch\u2019s parental rights. However, it was within the discretion of the trial court to reserve judgment following the May 2012 hearing.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Furthermore, this issue is now moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-7\">\u201c \u2018[T]he general rule [is] that appellate courts do not sit to give opinions on moot questions or abstract matters, but only to decide actual controversies injuriously affecting the rights of some party to the litigation.\u2019 \u201d <em>Baldwin v. Commonwealth, </em>43 Va.App. 415, 421, 598 S.E.2d 754, 757 (2004) (quoting <em>Hallmark v. Jones, </em>207 Va. 968, 971, 154 S.E.2d 5, 7 (1967)). The issues presented must be \u201clive\u201d at all stages of review. <em>Id. </em>\u201c \u2018Courts are not constituted ... to render advisory opinions, to decide moot questions or to answer inquiries which are merely speculative.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Commonwealth v. Harley, </em>256 Va. 216, 219-20, 504 S.E.2d 852, 854 (1998)). Where there is no actual controversy, the case will be dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>missed as moot. <em>Id. </em>And even, as is the case here, \u201cwhen the parties do not raise the issue of mootness, appellate courts should raise the issue <em>sua sponte </em>when the record does not present a live case or controversy.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 421-22, 598 S.E.2d at 757.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-4\">The circuit court\u2019s ultimate termination decision regarding C.W., entered on February 19, 2014, rendered moot any justiciable challenge to the court\u2019s delay in making that decision. <em>See Najera v. Chesapeake Division of Soc. Servs., </em>48 Va.App. 237, 241, 629 S.E.2d 721, 722 (2006) (\u201c[A] termination decision, if final and unappealed, moots any justiciable contest over a prior decision to approve DSS\u2019s foster care plan recommendations.\u201d). Because the circuit court decided to deny DSS\u2019s petition to terminate, it \u201cno longer matters\u201d how much time it took to do so. <em>Id. </em>at 241, 629 S.E.2d at 723. There is no relief that this Court can grant appellants, even if we were to agree that the circuit court should not have delayed its decision, because the decision has already been made.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Therefore, the appeal as to the question of whether the circuit court should have made its decision at an earlier time is dismissed as moot. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b89-5\">B. Refusal to Terminate Parental Rights</p>\n<p id=\"b89-6\">Next, appellants argue that the circuit court erred in denying DSS\u2019s petition to terminate Welch\u2019s parental rights to C.W. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>\u201cIn matters of a child\u2019s welfare, trial courts are vested with broad discretion in making the decisions necessary to guard and to foster a child\u2019s best interests.\u201d <em>Kilby v. Culpeper Dept. of Soc. Services, </em>55 Va.App. 106, 110, 684 S.E.2d 219, 220-21 (2009). \u201c[W]here, as here, the court hears the evidence <em>ore tenus, </em>its finding is entitled to the same weight accorded a jury verdict, and it will not be disturbed on appeal unless plainly wrong or without evidence to support it.\u201d <em>Martin v. Pittsylvania Cnty. Dep\u2019t of Soc. Servs., </em>3 Va.App. 15, 20, 348 S.E.2d 13, 16 (1986). \u201c \u2018[W]e presume the circuit court thoroughly weighed all the evidence, considered the statutory requirements, and made its determination based on the child\u2019s best interests.\u2019\u201d <em>T.S.G. v. B.A.S., </em>52 Va.App. 583, 588, 665 S.E.2d 854, 857 (2008) (quoting <em>Toms v. Hanover Dep\u2019t of Social Servs., </em>46 Va.App. 257, 265-66, 616 S.E.2d 765, 769 (2005)).</p>\n<p id=\"b90-4\">The United States Supreme Court has recognized that the Due Process Clause protects the \u201cfundamental right of parents to make decisions concerning the care, custody and control of their children.\u201d <em>Troxel v. Granville, </em>530 U.S. 57, 66, 120 S.Ct. 2054, 2060, 147 L.Ed.2d 49 (2000). That \u201cliberty interest ... does not evaporate simply because they have not been model parents.... [P]arents retain a vital interest in preventing the irretrievable destruction of their family life.\u201d <em>Santosky v. Kramer, </em>455 U.S. 745, 753, 102 S.Ct. 1388, 1395, 71 L.Ed.2d 599 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b90-5\">This Court has recognized that the termination of this fundamental right is a \u201c \u2018grave, drastic, and irreversible action.\u2019 \u201d <em>Helen W. v. Fairfax Cnty. Dep\u2019t of Human Dev., </em>12 Va.App. 877, 883, 407 S.E.2d 25, 28-29 (1991) (quoting <em>Lowe v. Dep\u2019t of Pub. Welfare, </em>231 Va. 277, 280, 343 S.E.2d 70, 72 (1986)). \u201c \u2018While it may be occasionally necessary to sever the legal relationship between parent and child, those circumstances are rare.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Weaver v. Roanoke Department of Human Resources, </em>220 Va. 921, 926, 265 S.E.2d 692, 695 (1980)). When considering petitions for termination of parental rights,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b91-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>\u201cwe must have a respect for the natural bond between children and their natural parents. The preservation of the family, and in particular the parent-child relationship, is an important goal for not only the parents but also government itself.... Statutes terminating the legal relationship between parent and child should be interpreted consistently with the governmental objective of preserving, when possible, the parent-child relationship.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b91-4\"><em>Richmond Dep\u2019t of Soc. Servs. v. L.P., </em>35 Va.App. 573, 580, 546 S.E.2d 749, 752-53 (2001) (quoting <em>Weaver, </em>220 Va. at 926, 265 S.E.2d at 695). \u201c \u2018[T]he rights of parents may not be lightly severed but are to be respected if <em>at all </em>consonant with the best interests of the child.\u2019\u201d <em>Ward v. Faw, </em>219 Va. 1120, 1124, 253 S.E.2d 658, 661 (1979) (quoting <em>Malpass v. Morgan, </em>213 Va. 393, 400, 192 S.E.2d 794, 799 (1972) (emphasis added)). And the state cannot \u201c \u2018infringe on the fundamental right of parents ... simply because a state judge believes a better decision could be made.\u2019\u201d <em>Dung Thi Thach v. Human Servs. Dep\u2019t, </em>63 Va.App. 157, 173, 754 S.E.2d 922, 930 (2014) (quoting <em>Copeland v. Todd, </em>282 Va. 183, 199, 715 S.E.2d 11, 19-20 (2011)). Finally, the Supreme Court has long recognized that when it comes to the custody of children, \u201cthe law presumes that the child\u2019s best interests will be served when in the custody of its parent.\u201d <em>Judd v. Van Horn, </em>195 Va. 988, 996, 81 S.E.2d 432, 436 (1954).</p>\n<p id=\"b91-5\">Code \u00a7 16.1-283(B) and (C) governs the termination of parental rights. In this case, DSS sought termination under subsection (C)(1) and (C)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b91-6\">Code \u00a7 16.1-283(0 provides that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b91-7\">[t]he residual parental rights of a parent or parents of a child placed in foster care as a result of court commitment, an entrustment agreement entered into by the parent or parents or other voluntary relinquishment by the parent or parents may be terminated if the court finds, based upon clear and convincing evidence, that it is in the best interests of the child <em>and </em>that:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b92-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>1.

Amherst Cnty. Dep\u2019t of Soc. Servs., </em>41 Va.App. 51, 56, 581 S.E.2d 886, 889 (2003) (quoting <em>Roanoke City Dep\u2019t of Soc. Servs. v. Heide, </em>35 Va.App. 328, 335-36, 544 S.E.2d 890, 893 (2001)). It follows that under Code \u00a7 16.1-283(C) the \u201ctrial judge must make two separate inquires in order to terminate parental rights.\u201d <em>Richmond Dep\u2019t of Soc. Servs. v. Crawley, </em>47 Va.App. 572, 579, 625 S.E.2d 670, 673 (2006). The court must find that DSS has met its burden of proving, by clear and convincing evidence: (1) that termination is in the best interests of the child; <em>and </em>(2) that the parent has not maintained a relationship with the child <em>or </em>remedied the conditions that led to foster care placement. <em>L.G., </em>41 Va.App. at 56, 581 S.E.2d at 889. Whether the second prong is met is determined by reference to the statutory time frames. <em>Crawley, </em>47 Va.App. at 579, 625 S.E.2d at 673.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-9\">However, because Code \u00a7 16.1-283(C) requires a two-pronged inquiry, a parent\u2019s failure to comply with the statutory time frames of (C)(1) or (C)(2) will never be dispositive. <em>See id. </em>DSS must always <em>also </em>prove by clear and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>convincing evidence the first prong: that termination is in the child\u2019s best interests. <em>See id. </em>And in evaluating the best interests of the child, \u201cthe factfinder may consider evidence before or after the twelve-month time period.\u201d <em>Thach, </em>63 Va.App. at 171, 754 S.E.2d at 929. To \u201ctemporally restrict the trial court\u2019s consideration\u201d of the parent-child relationship to the statutory periods in (C)(1) and (C)(2) would \u201c \u2018deny the fact finder the opportunity to evaluate the present best interests of the child.\u2019 \u201d <em>L.G., </em>41 Va.App. at 57, 581 S.E.2d at 889 (quoting <em>Heide, </em>35 Va.App. at 337, 544 S.E.2d at 894). Accordingly, a court may determine \u201c \u2018that a parent\u2019s delayed, but nonetheless substantial, progress may overcome the time delay.\u2019 \u201d <em>Thach, </em>63 Va.App. at 171, 754 S.E.2d at 929 (quoting <em>L.G., </em>41 Va.App. at 57, 581 S.E.2d at 889-90). \u201c We will not deprive the trial court of the opportunity to weigh the rights of the parents and the best interests of the child.\u2019 \u201d <em>L.G., </em>41 Va.App. at 57, 581 S.E.2d at 890 (quoting <em>Heide, </em>35 Va.App. at 337, 544 S.E.2d at 894).</p>\n<p id=\"b93-4\">Here, the appellants claim that termination of parental rights would have been proper under (C)(1) or (C)(2) because DSS proved by clear and convincing evidence that Welch did not maintain contact with C.W. for a period of more than six months after foster care placement and Welch did not correct the conditions that caused C.W. to be placed in foster care within twelve months of such placement. These arguments fail to recognize that termination is not necessarily or automatically in the best interests of the child, even where these statutory requirements are met by DSS. <em>See Crawley, </em>47 Va.App. at 582, 625 S.E.2d at 675 (\u201cThe lack of a definite timeline in which a parent will be able to comply with social services\u2019 plan is a relevant factor under the statute, but is not alone dispositive of the inquiry the trial judge must make under the statute.\u201d). In denying the petition to terminate in this case, the circuit court explicitly stated that \u201c[t]he preservation of the family is of utmost importance, especially when it is in the best interest of the child to do so.... The Court is looking at what is in the best interest of the child and permanency.\u201d Thus, the appellants cannot prevail simply by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>proving that Welch failed to comply with the requirements of (C)(1) or (C)(2). Rather, the appellants must persuade this Court that, as a matter of law, the circuit court erred in finding that termination was not in the best interests of C.W. This, they simply have not done.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-4\">This Court has said that \u201cthere is no simple, mechanical, \u2018cut and dried\u2019 way\u201d to apply the best interests of the child standard. <em>Peple v. Peple, </em>5 Va.App. 414, 422, 864 S.E.2d 232, 237 (1988). Instead, \u201cthe question must be resolved ... in light of the facts of each case.\u201d <em>Toombs v. Lynchburg Div. of Soc.

Tazewell County Dep\u2019t of Soc. Servs., </em>42 Va.App. 149, 161, 590 S.E.2d 575, 581-82 (2004) (quoting <em>Barkey v. Commonwealth, 2 </em>Va.App. 662, 668, 347 S.E.2d 188, 191 (1986)).</p>\n<p id=\"b94-7\">The circuit court considered appropriate factors in making its decision. In its December 20, 2013 opinion letter, the court discussed Welch\u2019s employment situation and financial ability to support C.W. The court also noted that Welch attended parenting classes and accepted responsibility for having her children taken away from her. The court found that \u201cthere is no evidence before the [c]ourt that the mother ever abused or neglected this child, except for her criminal enterprise.... \u201d As to C.W.\u2019s condition, the court found that \u201c[t]he evidence is that [C.W.] appears happy, well-adjusted, and is progressing normally at Head Start.... He does not appear to have any special needs.\u201d The court properly placed great weight on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>preservation of the family and stated that it \u201cconsider[ed] all relevant facts\u201d in making its decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-4\">Given that the best interests of the child analysis is highly fact-sensitive and discretionary, overturning the circuit court\u2019s decision in a case such as this regarding the best interests of the child would necessarily require this Court to improperly substitute its judgment for that of the circuit court. <em>See Simmons v. Simmons, </em>1 Va.App. 358, 361, 339 S.E.2d 198, 199 (1986).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> There simply is no bright line standard that this Court can apply to conclude that as a matter of law, the circuit court erred in determining that termination was not in the best interests of the child. Instead, we must presume that the circuit court made its determination based on' the best interests of the child. <em>T.S.G., </em>52 Va.App. at 588, 665 S.E.2d at 857. Here, because the circuit court relied on appropriate factors and pointed to some evidence supporting its decision, this Court cannot hold that the circuit court\u2019s best interests determination was \u201cplainly wrong\u201d or \u201cwithout evidence to support it.\u201d <em>Martin, </em>3 Va.App. at 20, 348 S.E.2d at 16.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-5\">The appellants argue that the circuit court improperly distinguished C.W. from his siblings in deciding his best interests. However, this Court has repeatedly affirmed decisions terminating a parent\u2019s right to only some of her children. <em>See Fauquier County Dep\u2019t of Soc. Servs. v. Ridgeway, </em>59 Va.App. 185, 717 S.E.2d 811 (2011); <em>Norfolk Div. Soc. Servs. v. Hardy, </em>42 Va.App. 546, 593 S.E.2d 528 (2004). The parent-child relationship is to be preserved whenever possible, even where the parent\u2019s relationship with his or her other children must be terminated. Welch\u2019s two older children, B.N.G. and B.S.G., witnessed Welch\u2019s abusive relationship with her husband. C.W., however, was only five months old when he was removed from Welch\u2019s care. The circuit court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>found that B.N.G. was a special needs child and that B.S.G. suffered from post traumatic stress disorder and anxiety. As a result, both older children were in need of special care that Welch could not provide. C.W., though, did not appear to need the specialized therapy that the two older children required. C.W. was progressing normally at a regular foster care home and was reported to be happy and healthy. Thus, the circuit court had credible factual basis for distinguishing C.W. from his siblings.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-4\">The appellants also argue that the circuit court erred in finding that termination was not in C.W.\u2019s best interests because Welch did not present evidence proving that she had the ability to parent C.W. However, DSS, not Welch, bore the burden of proving that parental rights should be terminated. When parents appeal to the circuit court from a final order of the JDR court terminating residual parental rights under Code \u00a7 16.1-283, the burden of proof is on DSS to demonstrate that the parent\u2019s residual parental rights should be terminated. <em>See Walker v. Dep\u2019t of Public Welfare, </em>223 Va. 557, 562, 290 S.E.2d 887, 890 (1982).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b96-5\">[T]he termination of parental rights ... requires that DHS establish by clear and convincing evidence that termination of a parent\u2019s right is the only reasonable and appropriate recourse \u2014 it does not require a parent to prove by clear and convincing evidence that he should retain his fundamental liberty interest in the custody of his child.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b96-6\"><em>Thach, </em>63 Va.App. at 174, 754 S.E.2d at 930. Thus, the appellants\u2019 argument that Welch did not present certain evidence supporting her ability to parent C.W. is irrelevant. She was entitled to rely on the strong presumption that it was in C.W.\u2019s best interests to ultimately be returned to his parent. DSS failed to meet its burden of proof and cannot make up for that failure on appeal by arguing that Welch\u2019s presentation of evidence was lacking.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-7\">III. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b96-8\">In summary, the trial court held that the DSS failed to prove, by clear and convincing evidence, that it was in the best <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>interests of C.W. to terminate Welch\u2019s parental rights. We cannot say that the evidence as to the best interests of the child, viewed in a light most favorable to Welch, was so overwhelming that this decision was plainly wrong. Accordingly, we affirm in part and dismiss in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-5\">Affirmed&gt; <em>in part and dismissed in part.</em></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b85-14\">. For purposes of this opinion, the Court has consolidated the cases of the Bristol Department of Social Services and Patricia E. Smith, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>Guardian <em>ad litem. </em>The facts of both cases are identical, the issues on appeal are the same, and the resolution of the cases is the same.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b88-8\">. The Supreme Court has repeatedly held that \" 'during the interval between the conclusion of the evidence and the entry of a written order ... [a trial court has] the inherent power, in the exercise of its discretion, to take the matter under advisement and to continue the case for future disposition.' \u201d <em>Starrs v. Commonwealth, </em>287 Va. 1, 7, 752 S.E.2d 812, 815 (2014) (quoting <em>Hernandez v. Commonwealth, </em>281 Va. 222, 226, 707 S.E.2d 273, 275 (2011)).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b89-7\">. This does not leave the parties without a remedy in future cases. Parties claiming that a judge has unreasonably delayed rendering a decision may seek relief by filing a complaint under Code \u00a7 17.1-107, which provides in part that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b89-8\">In any civil action, a judge of a circuit court who fails to act on any matter, claim, motion, or issue that has been submitted to the court for a decision or render a final decision in the action shall report, in writing, to the parties or their counsel on any such matter, claim, motion, issue, or action held under advisement for more than 60 days after such submission stating an expected time of a decision. In any civil action in which a judge fails to report as required by this section or fails to render a decision within the expected time stated in the report, any party or their counsel may notify the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b95-6\">. Indeed, the appellants have not cited a single case in which this Court has reversed the denial of a petition for termination on the grounds that termination would have been in the best interests of the child. Nor has this Court\u2019s research revealed any such case.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
