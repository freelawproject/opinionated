The Circuit Court for the City of Richmond upheld the Director\u2019s decision. The Hospital appeals, arguing that: (1) the Hospital\u2019s form admitting a patient for treatment, which is signed by a physician, satisfies the certification requirement; (2) alternatively, if the Hospital\u2019s certification was deficient, the Hospital\u2019s substantial compliance with its contractual obligations excuse the absence of a certification; and (3) finally, the Director and the circuit court should have adopted the hearing officer\u2019s recommendation. For the reasons noted below, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-7\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b255-8\">Culpeper Regional Hospital is a seventy-bed community hospital located in Culpeper, Virginia. The Hospital is a participating provider in the Medicaid program. DMAS is the agency charged with administering the Medicaid program for Virginia. According to the Provider Participation Agreement between the Hospital and DMAS, the Hospital must \u201ccomply with all applicable state and federal laws, as well as administrative policies and procedures of [DMAS] as from time to time amended.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b256-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>DMAS issues a Hospital Manual that contains applicable policies and procedures. The Manual specifies that \u201c[pjroviders will be required to refund payments made by Medicaid if they are found to have ... failed to maintain any record or adequate documentation to support their claims.\u201d Hosp. Manual, ch. VI, at 2 (June 12, 2006).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b256-4\">On October 24, 2011, DMAS informed the Hospital that an audit identified deficiencies in the Hospital\u2019s documentation. Specifically, the auditor determined that the Hospital failed to certify that admitting certain patients for inpatient treatment was medically necessary. Based on this failure, DMAS claimed it was entitled to recoup $46,760.10 in Medicaid payments it made to the Hospital. The Hospital argued that a patient\u2019s admission form is sufficient to satisfy the certification requirement and, in the alternative, that its substantial compliance with the contractual agreement precluded DMAS from recovering any past payments.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-5\">The Hospital eventually sought a formal appeal hearing pursuant to Code \u00a7 32.1-325.1. The Hospital withdrew its appeal for two of the patients at issue, leaving an amount in controversy of approximately $36,000. At the hearing, the Hospital contended that the Admission Order Forms, which were signed by a physician, satisfied the certification requirement. One of the Hospital\u2019s physicians testified that, in his eyes, the admission form is \u201cmy certification. That\u2019s my word. That\u2019s my name. And I\u2019m taking responsibility of it.\u201d The hearing officer found in favor of the Hospital, concluding that the Hospital\u2019s records were satisfactory and that DMAS\u2019s interpretation of the law was \u201carbitrary and capricious.\u201d DMAS appealed. The Director overturned the hearing officer\u2019s decision, finding his conclusion constituted \u201can error of law and Department policy.\u201d The Director upheld the retrac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>tion of payment. The Hospital appealed to the Circuit Court for the City of Richmond, which upheld the Director\u2019s decision. The instant appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-4\">ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b257-5\">The facts are not in dispute. The questions at issue in this appeal are matters of law. We review an agency\u2019s legal determinations <em>de novo, </em>while taking \u201cdue account of the presumption of official regularity, the experience and specialized competence of the agency, and the purposes of the basic law under which the agency has acted.\u201d Code \u00a7 2.2-4027. <em>See 1st Stop Health Services, Inc. v. Department of Medical Assistance Services, </em>63 Va.App. 266, 276-77, 756 S.E.2d 183, 188-89 (2014).</p>\n<p id=\"b257-6\">Federal regulations require a physician to \u201ccertify for each applicant or beneficiary that inpatient services in a hospital are or were <em>needed.\u201d </em>42 C.F.R. \u00a7 456.60(a)(1) (emphasis added). The Provider Participation Agreement further requires the Hospital to \u201ccomply with ... administrative policies and procedures of [DMAS] as from time to time amended.\u201d The Hospital Manual issued by DMAS provides that \u201cMedicaid requires that payment for certain covered services may be made to a provider of services only if there is a physician\u2019s certification concerning the necessity of the services furnished. ...\u201d Hosp. Manual, <em>supra, </em>ch. VI, at 2. \u201cA physician must certify the need for inpatient care at the time of admission.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 3 (emphasis is original). \u201cThe certification must be dated at the time it is signed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Furthermore, \u201c[t]he certification must be in writing and signed by an individual clearly identified as a physician (M.D.), doctor of osteopathy (D.O.), or dentist (D.D.S.).\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b257-7\">Neither the Manual nor applicable regulations specify any particular wording or format for the required certification. The Manual provides,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b257-8\">The certification may be either a separate form to be included with the patient\u2019s records or a stamp stating \u201cCertified for Necessary Hospital Admission\u201d which must <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>be made an identifiable part of the physician orders, history, and physical or other patient records. This certification must be signed and dated by the physician at the time of admission or, if an individual applies for assistance while in the hospital, before payment is to be made by DMAS.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b258-4\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b258-5\">I. The Hospital Did not Certify the Need for Inpatient Care.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-6\">The Hospital first argues that DMAS has imposed an \u201cunwritten, unknown standard\u201d on the Hospital by faulting the Hospital for failing to include \u201ccertifying language\u201d or an \u201cauthoritative attestation\u201d in the Hospital\u2019s records. Opening Br. at 10. It contends that checkboxes on the Admission Order Form indicating \u201cinpatient status,\u201d along with a physician signature and date, are sufficient to satisfy its obligation.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-7\">Although the regulation and the Manual do not define the term \u201ccertification,\u201d it has a plain meaning. \u201cCertification\u201d is simply \u201cthe act of certifying,\u201d <em>Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary </em>367 (1981), and to \u201ccertify\u201d means \u201cto attest ... authoritatively or formally.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Whatever form it takes, the certification is an additional step beyond simply admitting the patient. Merely admitting a patient does not constitute a formal act declaring that \u201cinpatient services in a hospital are or were needed.\u201d 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 456.60(a)(1). Instead, the admission form only admits the patient for treatment. The Hospital\u2019s interpretation would render the certification requirement superfluous, and we will not construe statutes or regulations in such a manner. <em>See, e.g., Cnty. of Albemarle v. Camirand, </em>285 Va. 420, 425, 738 S.E.2d 904, 906-07 (2013).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b259-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>II. The Contract Displaces Ordinary Principles of Substantial Compliance.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-4\">Alternatively, the Hospital argues that it substantially complied with the regulations governing the Medicaid program, that the failure to certify is a minor breach, and that DMAS does not contend that the Hospital provided unnecessary services.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-5\">The agreement between DMAS and the Hospital is governed by the law of contracts. <em>See Psychiatric Solutions of Va., Inc. v. Finnerty, </em>54 Va.App. 173, 176, 676 S.E.2d 358, 359 (2009). The law of contracts supplies a number of default rules that govern contract interpretation. For example, the law generally presumes that, in contracts for the sale of real estate, time is not of the essence. <em>Cranford v. Hubbard, </em>208 Va. 689, 694, 160 S.E.2d 760, 764 (1968). Nevertheless, the parties to a contract may agree to displace this default rule, and \u201c \u2018[t]ime may be made of the essence of the contract by express stipulation.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b259-6\">Another default rule is that of \u201cmaterial breach\u201d and \u201csubstantial compliance.\u201d The Supreme Court has recognized that,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b259-7\">[generally, a party who ... breaches] ... a contract is not entitled to enforce the contract. An exception to this rule arises when the breach did not go to the \u201croot of the contract\u201d but only to a minor part of the consideration. If the ... breaching party committed a material breach, however, that party cannot enforce the contract. A material breach is a failure to do something that is so fundamental to the contract that the failure to perform that obligation defeats an essential purpose of the contract.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b259-8\"><em>Horton v. Horton, </em>254 Va. 111, 115, 487 S.E.2d 200, 203-04 (1997) (quoting <em>Fed. Ins. Co. v. Starr Elec. Co., </em>242 Va. 459, 468, 410 S.E.2d 684, 689 (1991)); <em>see also Akers v. James T. Barnes of Wash., D.C., Inc., </em>227 Va. 367, 371, 315 S.E.2d 199, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>201 (1984). Substantial compliance is the inverse of the proposition that a breach of the contract must be \u201cmaterial\u201d or significant before it will excuse non-performance. <em>See </em>Restatement (Second) of Contracts \u00a7 237, cmt. d (1981) (\u201cThe considerations in determining whether performance is substantial are those listed in \u00a7 241 for determining whether a failure is material.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b260-5\">We addressed substantial compliance in the context of provider agreements in <em>Psychiatric Solutions. </em>In that case, we held that \u201ccontract principles applied to the interpretation of the provider agreement and that, under settled principles of contract law, appellant would be entitled to payment if its noncompliance did not amount to a material breach of the agreement.\u201d <em>Psychiatric Solutions of Va., Inc., </em>54 Va.App. at 176, 676 S.E.2d at 359-60. We concluded that the provider did not substantially comply because, on those facts, its documentation deficiencies were material. <em>Id. </em>at 190-91, 676 S.E.2d at 367. We rejected the argument that the failures to document represented a \u201c \u2018trifling\u2019 technical deficiency in the documentation of those sessions.\u201d <em>See id. </em>at 191-92, 676 S.E.2d at 367. Instead, as a factual matter, DMAS established that the documentation failure \u201csignificantly impacted\u201d the ability to provide care and, therefore, was a material breach. <em>See id. </em>at 192, 676 S.E.2d at 367-68.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-6\">We were called upon to revisit the issue of substantial compliance in <em>1st Stop Health Services, Inc. </em>We again concluded that the provider\u2019s documentation failures were material. 63 Va.App. at 270, 756 S.E.2d at 185. The provider\u2019s documentation in that case was \u201c \u2018abysmal\u2019 to the point [that] the auditor [could not] determine that certain payments were justified.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 280, 756 S.E.2d at 190. We also pointed to the language of the Provider Agreement and the applicable DMAS Manual to hold that the retraction of payment was a plainly authorized remedy for the provider\u2019s failure to maintain the required documentation. <em>Id. </em>at 281, 756 S.E.2d at 191.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>Turning to the case at bar, we find that the language of the agreement controls. The Provider Agreement requires the Hospital to follow the provisions of the Manual. The Manual unambiguously requires providers \u201cto refund payments made by Medicaid if they are found to have ... failed to maintain any record or adequate documentation to support their claims.\u201d Hosp. Manual, <em>supra, </em>ch. VI, at 2. The Hospital was required to \u201ccertify for each applicant or beneficiary that inpatient services in a hospital are or were needed.\u201d 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 456.60(a)(1). The Hospital failed to make this required certification. DMAS could enforce the terms of the agreement and require repayment for patients that were admitted without the required certification. Accordingly, the Director was entitled to set aside, as contrary to law, the hearing officer\u2019s decision in favor of the Hospital.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-4\">The retraction of payment under the facts before us, where there is no allegation of self-dealing or impropriety by the Hospital, may come across as harsh and formalistic. Nevertheless,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b261-5\">It is the function of the court to construe the contract made by the parties, not ... to alter the contract they have made so as to conform it to the court\u2019s notion of the contract they should have made in view of the subject matter and the surrounding facts and circumstances.... The court ... is not at liberty ... to put a construction on the words the parties have used which they <em>do not properly bear. </em>It is the court\u2019s duty to declare what the <em>instrument itself </em>says it says.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b261-6\"><em>Ames v. Am. Nat\u2019l Bank of Portsmouth, </em>163 Va. 1, 38, 176 S.E. 204, 216 (1934) (emphasis in original). Moreover, courts will not set aside a contractual provision simply because it constitutes a \u201c \u2018hard bargain.\u2019 \u201d <em>Payne v. Simmons, </em>232 Va. 379, 384, 350 S.E.2d 637, 640 (1986) (quoting <em>Long v. Harrison, </em>134 Va. 424, 441-42, 114 S.E. 656, 661-62 (1922)).</p>\n<p id=\"b261-7\">Accordingly, we affirm the judgment below.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b262-4\">We affirm the judgment of the Circuit Court for the City of Richmond.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-5\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b256-6\">. The Manual was revised in 2009. The only substantive difference between the 2006 Manual and the 2009 Manual, as relevant here, is that the 2009 Manual provides that the physician may complete, sign, and date the certification within twenty-four hours of admission rather than at the time of admission. That change is not at issue in this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b258-8\">. Invoking the void for vagueness doctrine, the Hospital argues that its rights to due process were violated when DMAS \"impos[ed] a requirement that was altogether absent from the relevant Manual provisions and the applicable federal regulation.\u201d Opening Br. at 13. This argument fails, first, because DMAS has done no such thing. Second, the argument is not encompassed by any assignment of error. Accordingly, it is barred for that reason as well. <em>See </em>Rule 5A:20(c); <em>Ceres </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number><em>Marine Terminals v.
