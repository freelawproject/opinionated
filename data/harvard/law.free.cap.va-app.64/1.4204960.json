Loewinger (\u201cappellant\u201d) appeals an order of the Circuit Court of Loudoun County (\u201ctrial court\u201d) directing Stephen J. Loewinger (\u201cLoewinger\u201d) to pay appellant a lump sum amount of $59,805.67 pursuant to the parties\u2019 premarital agreement. Appellant presents the following assignments of error on appeal:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b48-12\">1. The [trial cjourt erred in its interpretation of the parties\u2019 premarital agreement in the way the [trial cjourt calculated the marital share of the proceeds of the Bethesda, Maryland property upon its sale in 2004 to determine [appellant\u2019s] interest therein.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b48-13\">2. The [trial cjourt erred in its interpretation of the parties\u2019 premarital agreement by excluding from [appellant\u2019s] lump sum award her share of the marital portion of the equity in the Bethesda, Maryland property, which had been retained by [Loewinger] following the sale of that property in 2004.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b49-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"3\">*3</page-number>For the following reasons, this Court holds that appellant\u2019s action against the Estate of Stephen J. Loewinger (\u201cappellee\u201d) in the present case is a nullity. Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-5\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b49-6\">\u201cWhen reviewing a trial court\u2019s decision on appeal, we view the evidence in the light most favorable to the prevailing party, granting it the benefit of any reasonable inferences.\u201d <em>Congdon v. Congdon, </em>40 Va.App. 255, 258, 578 S.E.2d 833, 835 (2003). So viewed, the evidence is as follows.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-7\">On December 2, 1999, the parties executed a premarital agreement (\u201cthe agreement\u201d) prior to, and in consideration of, their marriage on December 18, 1999. At the time of their marriage, Loewinger owned a house in Bethesda, Maryland (\u201cthe Bethesda house\u201d) that became the parties\u2019 marital residence after the wedding. The agreement states that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AC\">The parties agree that [Loewinger] shall retain a separate interest in [the Bethesda house] in an amount equal to the net asset value of the property as of the date of the marriage as shown on Exhibit A. The parties further agree that any appreciation beyond the value as shown on Exhibit A shall be treated as marital property [ (\u201cmarital equity\u201d) ] to be shared equally by the parties in the event their marriage should subsequently dissolved [sic] by Decree of Divorce.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b49-8\">Elsewhere, the agreement states that \u201call property now owned by either party shall remain and be his/her separate property---- The property currently owned by each party is set forth on Exhibits A and B, which by reference are made a part hereof.\u201d Exhibit A, which details Loewinger\u2019s separate property at the time the agreement was executed, lists multiple retirement and money market accounts, including an account Loewinger referred to as his premarital \u201cmoney market account.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b49-10\">In 1999, when the parties entered into the agreement, the Bethesda house was valued at $500,000 with a mortgage debt <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>of $265,000. The parties sold the Bethesda house in 2004, however, for $810,000. When the house was sold, it had an outstanding mortgage debt of $311,898.55. This increased mortgage debt led the trial court to conclude, by \u201cinference,\u201d that the Bethesda house had been refinanced even though there was not \u201cany direct evidence\u201d of this. After satisfying the outstanding mortgage and closing costs from the sale of the Bethesda house, the parties netted $458,289.20, the entirety of which was deposited into Loewinger\u2019s money market account.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-5\">In August 2011, eight years after the sale of the Bethesda house, Loewinger left the marital home and instituted divorce proceedings against appellant. At the time of the parties\u2019 trial for divorce and distribution of marital property on August 29, 2012, the money market account had a balance of $811. The trial court found that after depositing the proceeds from the sale of the Bethesda house in the money market account, Loewinger had used the money to make a substantial down payment on a house in Leesburg, Virginia, buy a $38,000 Lexus for appellant, redecorate their house, install a deck, and <em>go on </em>family vacations.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-6\">In the decree of divorce, the trial court awarded appellant $59,805.67 as a lump sum award under the agreement. The trial court also noted, however, that \u201cthere is no money left from [the sale of the] Bethesda [house]. Had there been, [appellant] would have ... received a more significant sum.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b50-7\">On October 6, 2013, more than one year after the entry of the divorce decree, Loewinger passed away, causing the trial court to enter a final order dismissing the case on November 20, 2013.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Appellant subsequently noted her appeal to this Court on December 12, 2013, but thereafter obtained leave for the trial court to substitute Stephen Loewinger\u2019s estate as the party in interest.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b51-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>II. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b51-4\">On appeal, appellant contends the trial court erred in its interpretation of the premarital agreement. Specifically, appellant argues that the trial court erred (1) in \u201cits interpretation of the parties\u2019 premarital agreement ... [when] calculating] the marital share of the proceeds from the sale of the Bethesda [house],\u201d and (2) by \u201cexcluding from [appellant\u2019s] lump sum award her share of the marital portion of the equity in the Bethesda [house].... \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b51-5\">As an initial matter, however, appellee responds by arguing that the current appeal is a nullity and must be dismissed because appellee is not a proper party to the case. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-6\">It is well established in Virginia that \u201c[a]ll suits and actions must be prosecuted by and against living parties, in either an individual or representative capacity.\u201d <em>Rennolds v. Williams, </em>147 Va. 196, 198, 136 S.E. 597, 597 (1927). This is so because \u201c[t]here must be such parties to the record as can be affected by the judgment and from whom obedience can be compelled.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 198-99, 136 S.E. at 597. This principle applies \u201cto writs of error, which are in the nature of new actions, as well as to an original action.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 199, 136 S.E. at 597; <em>see also </em>Martin P. Burks, <em>Common Law and Statutory Pleading and Practice </em>\u00a7 423 (4th ed.1952) (\u201cappellate proceedings must be between living persons, either in a personal or representative capacity ... and if the defendant-in-error dies after the judgment appealed from, but before the writ of error is applied for, the writ of error will be dismissed as it should have been applied for against the personal representative of the deceased\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b51-7\">Accordingly, Code \u00a7 8.01-229(B)(1) and (B)(2) \u201cdirect [a] decedent\u2019s <em>personal representative </em>to file any personal action which the decedent may have been entitled to bring and to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>defend any personal action which could be brought against the decedent.\u201d <em>Swann v. Marks, </em>252 Va. 181,184, 476 S.E.2d 170, 171 (1996) (emphasis added). This limitation is further highlighted by the language of Code \u00a7 8.01-229(B) \u201cwhich allows <em>claims </em>to be filed against the property of the estate, but provides that <em>actions </em>may only be filed against the decedent\u2019s personal representative.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing Code \u00a7 8.01-229(B)(2) and (B)(4)).</p>\n<p id=\"b52-4\">In the present case, appellant is not asserting a \u201cclaim ... against the property of [Loewinger\u2019s] estate,\u201d <em>id., </em>but rather, she is asserting an action against Loewinger personally based upon the terms of their premarital agreement. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 8.01-2 (defining \u201c[a]ction,\u201d for the purposes of Title 8, as a term that \u201cmay be used interchangeably [with \u2018suit\u2019] and shall include all civil proceedings whether upon claims at law, in equity, or statutory in nature and whether in circuit courts or district courts\u201d). In other words, appellant is asserting a contract action against Loewinger personally. <em>See Smith v. Smith, </em>43 Va.App. 279, 286-87, 597 S.E.2d 250, 254 (2004) (premarital agreements \u201cshould be interpreted and enforced no differently than any other type of contract\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b52-5\">As such, appellant was required under Code \u00a7 8.01-229(B)(2) to name Loewinger\u2019s personal representative, not his estate, as the party in interest in the present case. Appellant\u2019s failure to do so nullifies her appeal, and, therefore, the appeal must be dismissed. <em>See Rennolds, </em>147 Va. at 200-01, 136 S.E. at 598.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b53-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b53-5\">For the foregoing reasons, this Court holds that appellant\u2019s action against appellee in the present case is a nullity. Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-6\">\n<em>Dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b50-8\">. At the time of appellee's death, the parties were still litigating issues regarding custody and visitation of their minor child.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b50-9\">. After noting her appeal, appellant filed with this Court a \"Motion for Substitution of Appellee or, In the Alternative, for a Stay of Appeal to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>Permit Entiy of Order of Substitution by the Circuit Court.\u201d Upon consideration of this motion, this Court granted \"leave\u201d for \"the trial court to consider the appellant[\u2019s] motion for substitution.\u201d The trial court then granted appellant\u2019s motion to substitute Stephen Loewinger\u2019s estate as the party in interest.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b52-6\">. Code \u00a7 8.01-20 provides that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b52-7\">[i]f at any time after verdict or judgment in the trial court during the pendency of an appeal or before the appeal is granted ... [there is a] death of a party ... the Court of Appeals or Supreme Court ... may, in its discretion, take or retain jurisdiction and enter judgment or decree in the case as if such event had not occurred.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b52-8\">This provision, however, \"has no application where the death occurs <em>before </em>the appeal or writ of error is awarded.\" <em>Rennolds, </em>147 Va. at 199, 136 S.E. at 597-98 (emphasis added); <em>see also Poff v. Poff, </em>128 Va. 62, 72, 104 S.E. 719, 722 (1920) (\"Where [the death of a party] occurs before the appeal is allowed ... the suit or action abates as to the deceased party.... But where an appeal is allowed ... before such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>death, the case is from that moment a case pending in the appellate court, and under the statute ... there is no abatement in the appellate court because of death.\u201d (citing <em>Reid v. Strider, </em>48 Va. (7 Gratt.) 76 (1850))).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
