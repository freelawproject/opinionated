On appeal he contends that the trial court erred: 1) when it denied his motion to dismiss the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>indictments against him, because the delay prior to his indictment violated his right to due process; 2) when it denied his motion to strike ten of the indecent liberties charges on the grounds they were incidental to the manufacturing of child pornography charges and a conviction for both offenses violated double jeopardy principles; 3) when it denied his motion to strike ten counts of indecent liberties down to one count on the grounds that the unit of prosecution for indecent liberties is a common scheme or transaction; and 4) when it denied his motion to strike ten counts of manufacturing child pornography down to one count on the grounds that the unit of prosecution for manufacturing child pornography is a common scheme or transaction. For the reasons that follow, we disagree and affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-4\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"Ary\">A. Underlying Offenses</p>\n<p id=\"b450-5\">In 2004, appellant was convicted of carnal knowledge and aggravated sexual battery for offenses he committed against his stepdaughters, L.M. and S.M. In August 2004, while incarcerated for those offenses, appellant placed a series of seven calls to his wife, Helen Mason, over a three-day span, in which he requested \u201ckinky pictures\u201d of L.M. Helen Mason subsequently took ten pictures of L.M. in various sexually explicit poses, following appellant\u2019s instructions as to the kind of pictures he wanted. Mason then delivered the photographs to appellant at the detention center where he was imprisoned.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b450-6\">Appellant and Mason were both criminally charged for their actions. On September 14, 2004, Mason was indicted on numerous counts of indecent liberties and production of obscene materials arising out of the August 2004 events involving L.M. In March of the following year, Mason was convicted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>of five counts of indecent liberties and ten counts of production of obscene material. She appealed her convictions to this Court. Thereafter, on April 15, 2005, appellant was indicted on three counts of taking indecent liberties with a minor, ten counts of producing child pornography, and two counts of conspiracy. Those indictments were subsequently <em>nolle prosequied </em>during the pendency of Mason\u2019s appeal of her convictions to this Court. We issued an opinion affirming Mason\u2019s convictions on November 7, 2006. <em>See Mason v. Commonwealth, </em>49 Va.App. 39, 636 S.E.2d 480 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b451-5\">Still incarcerated for his prior convictions of carnal knowledge and aggravated sexual battery, on November 13, 2012, appellant was indicted on eleven counts of indecent liberties with a minor, in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-370, ten counts of manufacturing child pornography, in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-374.1(B), and three counts of conspiracy, in violation of Code \u00a7\u00a7 18.2-22 and 18.2-374.1 all relating to his August 2004 actions involving L.M.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-6\">On December 5, 2012, the Office of the Attorney General filed a civil petition to commit appellant as a sexually violent predator pursuant to the Civil Commitment of Sexually Violent Predators Act. Citing appellant\u2019s convictions for carnal knowledge and aggravated sexual battery, as well as a Sexually Violent Predator Evaluation of appellant prepared by Dr. Ilona Gravers, a licensed clinical psychologist, who had been designated by the Commissioner of the Department of Behavioral Health and Development Services to conduct a mental health examination of appellant, the Attorney General alleged that appellant met the criteria under Code \u00a7 37.2-900 as a sexually violent predator. As detailed in her evaluation, Dr. Gravers diagnosed appellant with a personality disorder that made appellant more likely to engage in future sexually violent acts.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-7\">B. Motion to Dismiss</p>\n<p id=\"b451-8\">Appellant filed with the trial court a motion to dismiss the indictments against him, alleging that his prosecution following a preindictment delay of over eight years violated his due <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>process rights. He asserted in a supporting memorandum that he was prejudiced by the delay, as \u201cthe age of the case and witnesses\u2019 diminished memories\u201d made \u201ca proper investigation by the defense ... all but impossible,\u201d \u201cevidence may have been lost or misplaced,\u201d and the victim would likely \u201ctestify differently\u201d now as an adult than she would have as a minor. Appellant also asserted that the development of \u201ccase law favorable to the prosecution\u201d and \u201csociety\u2019s view of child pornography offenders[, which had] evolved and become more harsh over the intervening years,\u201d \u201cstrengthened the prosecution\u2019s hand.\u201d Finally, appellant expressed concern that Dr. Gravers\u2019 evaluation \u201cmay have played a role in the charging decision\u201d for his August 2004 offenses and that appellant\u2019s statements to Dr. Gravers \u201ccould possibly be used against him at either the trial or sentencing in his criminal case.\u201d The preindictment delay was not only prejudicial, appellant argued, but also \u201cdone by a prosecutor seeking a tactical advantage\u201d at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-4\">In a memorandum in opposition to appellant\u2019s motion to dismiss, the Commonwealth explained both its decision to <em>nolle prosequi </em>the initial charges against appellant and to subsequently seek indictments against appellant in 2012. The Commonwealth stated that it moved to <em>nolle prosequi </em>the initial charges against appellant when Helen Mason appealed her convictions because \u201c[t]he Commonwealth wanted to avoid [L.M.] having to testify multiple times. If the Court of Appeals remanded the <em>Mason </em>case it would also remand[ ] [appellant\u2019s] case and the victim would have to testify in a total of four trials if both cases were then re-tried.\u201d When Helen Mason\u2019s appeal finally resolved, L.M. \u201cwas sixteen and it had been three years since she had been removed from [her] home,\u201d and appellant \u201cremained incarcerated on other charges.\u201d The Commonwealth explained that it chose not to seek indictments against appellant at that time because \u201c[t]he cost of putting [L.M.] through trial was too great compared to any benefit.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b452-5\">The record suggests, however, that the calculus changed in 2012, when the Commonwealth became aware that appellant had contacted L.M.\u2019s sister, and after the Los Angeles County <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>District Attorney\u2019s Office contacted the Commonwealth regarding allegations that appellant had forcibly raped a child in California in 2000. That information led the Commonwealth to contact L.M., who expressed her interest in seeing appellant charged because \u201cshe did not want [appellant] doing the same thing to anybody else.\u201d The Commonwealth justified its 2012 indictment of appellant for these reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-4\">The trial court held a hearing on appellant\u2019s motion to dismiss on April 8, 2013. The trial court indicated at that time that the only issue \u201cthat had any traction, was the sexually violent predator evaluation\u201d performed by Dr. Gravers. However, upon the Commonwealth Attorney\u2019s assertion that he had not read the evaluation, did not intend to introduce it at trial, and intended to confine the evidence to events occurring in 2004, the trial court concluded that the evaluation \u201c[was] not an issue in th[e] case.\u201d The trial court denied appellant\u2019s motion to dismiss, finding that appellant had failed to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that he suffered actual prejudice or that the Commonwealth intentionally delayed indicting him in order to gain a tactical advantage.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-5\">C. Bench Trial</p>\n<p id=\"b453-6\">The trial court held a bench trial on July 17, 2013. The Commonwealth offered two main witnesses. Gene Boyce, a systems officer for the detention center at which appellant was imprisoned, authenticated a CD that contained relevant portions of the August 2004 phone conversations between appellant, Mason, and L.M. L.M. also testified for the Commonwealth. L.M. testified that the voices on the recording belonged to appellant, Helen Mason, and herself. L.M. also identified the ten photographs taken of her by Mason in August 2004. L.M. testified that she \u201cdidn\u2019t want to ... [take] the pictures,\u201d but her mother threatened to \u201csend [her] back to foster care\u201d if she did not. L.M. testified that all ten photographs were taken on one night. L.M. was only thirteen when the photographs were taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-7\">Following the Commonwealth\u2019s case-in-chief, appellant made a motion to strike. Appellant first moved to strike the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>eleven counts of indecent liberties down to one count of indecent liberties. Appellant argued that \u201cthe unit of prosecution for indecent liberties is not each proposal\u201d that a minor expose her sexual or genital parts. Rather, appellant asserted that \u201c[i]f there is a continuing kind of scheme or one prolonged proposal ... [then] the whole incident is the unit of prosecution.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b454-5\">Appellant next moved to strike the charges of indecent liberties on the grounds that each indecent liberties charge was incidental to the manufacture of child pornography-charges. Appellant therefore contended that his conviction for both offenses would violate double jeopardy principles. Appellant clarified under questioning from the trial court that an indecent liberties offense is not incidental to every production of child pornography offense \u2014 but each indecent liberties offense \u201cin this instance\u201d was incidental to the production of child pornography.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-6\">Finally, appellant raised a motion to strike the ten counts of manufacturing child pornography down to one count. Appellant argued that the \u201cunit of prosecution should be the incident during which pictures were taken and there is only one here.\u201d In making that argument, appellant acknowledged that this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Mason </em>held \u201cthat the unit of prosecution for child pornography is the number of pictures,\u201d but appellant argued that the <em>Mason </em>Court\u2019s decision was incorrect.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-7\">The trial court denied each of appellant\u2019s motions to strike. Appellant did not put on any evidence and renewed his motions to strike, which the trial court again denied. The trial court found appellant guilty of each of the ten counts of manufacturing child pornography and the eleven counts of indecent liberties with a minor.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-8\">D. Sentencing</p>\n<p id=\"b454-9\">The trial court held a sentencing hearing on August 9, 2013. During the hearing, the Commonwealth submitted a sex offender evaluation form prepared by Dr. Gravers. The form <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>was required at sentencing under Code \u00a7 19.2-301 and distinct from Dr. Gravers\u2019 sexually violent predator evaluation that was previously prepared for the civil case. However, Dr. Gravers consulted the sexually violent predator evaluation while preparing the sex offender evaluation. The trial court permitted the introduction of the sex offender evaluation over appellant\u2019s objection that Dr. Gravers improperly used the prior sexually violent predator evaluation report as a source of information. The trial court then sentenced appellant to a total term of imprisonment of thirty years, with ten years suspended.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-4\">This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-5\">ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b455-6\">A. Preindictment Delay</p>\n<p id=\"b455-7\">Appellant first contends that the trial court erred when it denied his motion to dismiss the indictments for violating his right to due process. On appeal, appellant argues that the charges against him should have been dismissed with prejudice because the preindictment delay of over eight years was entirely unjustified, prejudicial, and done by a prosecutor seeking a tactical advantage at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-8\">It is not questioned that the primary guarantee against stale prosecutions is the statute of limitations. <em>See Anderson v. Commonwealth, </em>48 Va.App. 704, 711, 634 S.E.2d 372, 375 (2006) (\u201cVirginia has no general statute of limitations on felonies.\u201d). As we have noted previously, \u201cthe Constitution plays [only] a \u2018limited role\u2019 in situations alleging preindictment delay.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 712, 634 S.E.2d at 375 (quoting <em>Morrisette v. Commonwealth, </em>264 Va. 386, 393, 569 S.E.2d 47, 52 (2002)). \u201cIn cases of [preindictment] delay, the issue is whether the accused was denied due process as a result of the delay.\u201d <em>Hall v. Commonwealth, </em>8 Va.App. 526, 529, 383 S.E.2d 18, 20 (1989). \u201cDue process principles bar a prosecution for preindictment delay only when the \u2018defendant incurred actual prejudice as a result of the delay\u2019 and the \u2018prosecutor intentionally delayed indicting the defendant to gain a tactical advantage.\u2019 \u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number><em>Anderson, </em>48 Va.App. at 712, 634 S.E.2d at 376 (quoting <em>Morrisette, </em>264 Va. at 393, 569 S.E.2d at 52). \u201cThe defendant bears the burden of proving both actual prejudice and improper purpose.\u201d <em>Morrisette, </em>264 Va. at 393, 569 S.E.2d at 52.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-4\">Appellant has not shown that he was meaningfully impaired in his ability to defend against the charges to such an extent that he was denied a fair trial. On appeal, appellant advances numerous assertions of prejudice. Appellant contends that he was prejudiced by the preindictment delay because during that time society\u2019s view of child pornography offenders hardened, this Court issued an opinion that strengthened the Commonwealth\u2019s hand in plea negotiations, the Commonwealth gained access to Dr. Gravers\u2019 sexually violent predator evaluation, and L.M. \u201chad grown up, gone to counseling, and <em>become </em>a better witness for\u201d the Commonwealth. However, to constitute a showing of actual prejudice, appellant must prove actual and concrete prejudice as a result of the delay, not merely speculative prejudice. <em>See generally United States v. Madden, </em>682 F.3d 920, 929 (10th Cir.2012) (\u201c \u2018To constitute a showing of actual prejudice ... the defendant must show that he has suffered definite and not speculative prejudice.\u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>United States v. Colonna, </em>360 F.3d 1169, 1177 (10th Cir.2004))). <em>Accord United States v. Gregory, </em>322 F.3d 1157, 1165 (9th Cir.2003); <em>United States v. Crouch, </em>84 F.3d 1497, 1523 (5th Cir.1996); <em>Acha v. United States, </em>910 F.2d 28, 32 (1st Cir.1990); <em>United States v. Antonino, </em>830 F.2d 798, 805 (7th Cir.1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b456-5\">Appellant\u2019s allegations fail to show actual prejudice to his right to a fair trial. Appellant\u2019s claim that society\u2019s view of child pornography offenders has hardened over the years and this \u201cincreased intolerance for such offenders <em>would have been </em>reflected in a jury pool, <em>had </em>this case gone to a jury trial,\u201d is entirely speculative. Appellant\u2019s Br. at 13. Appellant waived his right to a jury trial, he has not asserted that he would have chosen a jury trial but for the delay, and he has not asserted that society\u2019s \u201cincreased intolerance\u201d actually prejudiced his bench trial. Moreover, even if appellant had chosen a jury <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>trial, his claim would still fall short of demonstrating actual prejudice. Implicit in appellant\u2019s argument that society\u2019s hardening view \u201cwould have been reflected in a jury pool,\u201d is the speculative premise that this \u201cincreased intolerance\u201d would have biased the jury against him. But such an unsubstantiated claim of bias falls short of demonstrating actual, concrete prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-5\">Similarly, appellant has not shown how the Commonwealth\u2019s \u201cstrengthen[ed] ... hand in plea negotiations\u201d prejudiced him at trial. Appellant was not entitled to an even hand in plea negotiations with the Commonwealth, and the Commonwealth was not required to entrench its position based on the status quo at the time of appellant\u2019s offenses. Like all agreements, plea negotiations are fluid until finalized. <em>See generally Lampkins v. Commonwealth, </em>44 Va.App. 709, 723, 607 S.E.2d 722, 729 (2005) (\u201cAbsent judicial approval, a proposed plea agreement cannot be binding on the Commonwealth because the defendant has suffered no harm.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b457-6\">Likewise, appellant\u2019s conclusory allegation that L.M. matured as a witness during the preindictment delay does not demonstrate prejudice to appellant\u2019s defense at trial. Despite his claim that L.M. \u201chad become a better witness\u201d for the Commonwealth, appellant has not demonstrated any effect this had on his ability to defend against the charges at trial. As appellant conceded below, he did not lose any evidence or witnesses as a result of the delay. Appellant also stated on brief that \u201cthere was <em>no </em>significant additional investigation into this case\u201d during the delay, (emphasis in original). At trial, the case remained as before, including L.M.\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-7\">Finally, appellant has not demonstrated that the Commonwealth\u2019s access to the sexually violent predator evaluation prepared for the civil adjudication prejudiced his right to a fair trial, as the Commonwealth\u2019s Attorney conceded during the hearing on appellant\u2019s motion to dismiss that the report was not relevant to the charges against appellant. Even more significant, the evaluation was not introduced during appellant\u2019s trial. Put simply, appellant has not demonstrated any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>real, concrete prejudice the preindictment delay caused to his ability to defend against the charged offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-4\">Because appellant failed to meet his burden of proving that he suffered actual prejudice as a result of the preindictment delay, we need not consider at length appellant\u2019s claim that the Commonwealth intentionally delayed indicting him in order to gain a tactical advantage at trial. We find it sufficient to note that the trial court concluded that the Commonwealth delayed indicting appellant out of \u201cconsideration for the victim\u201d and not in order to gain a tactical advantage over appellant. The trial court\u2019s determination on the question of intent is a finding of fact to which we accord great deference and reverse only if clearly erroneous. <em>See Evans v. Commonwealth, 228 </em>Va. 468, 479, 323 S.E.2d 114, 120 (1984) (finding that the record supported the trial court\u2019s finding that \u201cthe evidence fail[ed] to prove ... that the Commonwealth purposefully and wrongfully delayed resolution of the defendant\u2019s petition for a writ of habeas corpus in order to achieve a tactical advantage\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b458-5\">Upon our review of the record, we find that the trial court\u2019s decision is not without support in the evidence. During the hearing on appellant\u2019s motion to dismiss, the Commonwealth\u2019s Attorney explained that he delayed indicting appellant prior to November 2012 because \u201c[t]he cost of putting [L.M.] through trial was too great compared to any [possible] benefit.\u201d Moreover, the Commonwealth\u2019s Attorney stated that he charged appellant only after speaking to the victim, who expressed her willingness to testify in order to prevent appellant from doing \u201cto anybody else\u201d what he had done to her. Accordingly, we find that appellant has not demonstrated that the Commonwealth intentionally delayed indicting him in order to gain a tactical advantage at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-6\">Because appellant has not shown that the preindictment delay caused him actual prejudice at trial and that the Commonwealth intentionally delayed indicting him in order to gain a tactical advantage, his due process challenge must fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>B. Double Jeopardy</p>\n<p id=\"b459-4\">Appellant next contends that the trial court erred when it denied appellant\u2019s motion to strike ten of the indecent liberties charges on the grounds that they are incidental to the manufacture of child pornography charges and a conviction for both violates double jeopardy principles.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-5\">\u201cThe constitutional provision concerning double jeopardy embodies three guarantees: \u2018(1) It protects against a second prosecution for the same offense after acquittal. [ (2) ] It protects against a second prosecution for the same offense after conviction. [ (3) ] And it protects against multiple punishments for the same offense.\u2019\u201d <em>Blythe v. Commonwealth, </em>222 Va. 722, 725, 284 S.E.2d 796, 797 (1981) (quoting <em>Illinois v. Vitale, </em>447 U.S. 410, 415, 100 S.Ct. 2260, 2264, 65 L.Ed.2d 228 (1980)). \u201cTwo offenses will be considered the same when (1) the two offenses are identical, (2) the former offense is lesser included in the subsequent offense, or (3) the subsequent offense is lesser included in the former offense.\u201d <em>Commonwealth v. Hudgins, </em>269 Va. 602, 605, 611 S.E.2d 362, 364 (2005). The Double Jeopardy Clause \u201cdoes not apply where the same conduct is used to support convictions for separate and distinct crimes.\u201d <em>Brown v. Commonwealth, </em>37 Va.App. 507, 517, 559 S.E.2d 415, 420 (2002). \u201cIt is well settled that two or more distinct and separate offenses may grow out of a single incident or occurrence, warranting the prosecution and punishment of an offender for each.\u201d <em>Jones v. Commonwealth, </em>208 Va. 370, 375, 157 S.E.2d 907, 910 (1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b459-6\">\u201cWhen \u2018the same act or transaction constitutes a violation of two distinct statutory provisions, the test to be applied to determine whether there are two offenses or only one is whether each [offense charged] requires proof of an additional fact which the other does not.\u2019 \u201d <em>Coleman v. Commonwealth, </em>261 Va. 196, 200, 539 S.E.2d 732, 734 (2001) (quoting <em>Blockburger v. United States, </em>284 U.S. 299, 304, 52 S.Ct. 180, 182, 76 L.Ed. 306 (1932)). In applying this test, we \u201clook at the offenses charged in the abstract, without referring to the particular facts of the case under review.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cThis <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>standard requires that we view the elements of the offenses generally and conceptually, rather than the elements of the offenses as charged in a specific instance.\u201d <em>Johnson v. Commonwealth, </em>58 Va.App. 303, 323, 709 S.E.2d 175, 185 (2011). \u201cThus, \u2018[a] double jeopardy violation exists only if the offenses <em>always </em>require proof of the same elements.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Davis v. Commonwealth, </em>57 Va.App. 446, 456, 703 S.E.2d 259, 263 (2011) (emphasis added)).</p>\n<p id=\"b460-5\">As in effect at the time of appellant\u2019s offenses,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Code \u00a7 18.2-374.1 stated, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b460-6\">B.

(3) Propose[s] that any such child feel or fondle his own sexual or genital parts of the sexual or genital parts of such person or propose that such person feel or fondle the sexual or genital parts of any such child; or (4) Propose[s] to such child the performance of an act of sexual intercourse ... or (5) Entice[s], allure[s], persu\u00e1delas], or invite[s] any such child to enter any vehicle, room, house, or other place, for any of the purposes set forth in the preceding subdivisions....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b461-5\">Code \u00a7 18.2-370(B) states, in relevant part, that any person over the age of eighteen who, \u201cwith lascivious intent, knowingly and intentionally ... encourages [a person under the age of 18 years] to perform in or be a subject of sexually explicit material is guilty of a Class 5 felony.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b461-6\">Analytically, the charged offenses do not require proof of the same elements in all circumstances. Appellant conceded this point at trial. When asked by the trial court whether \u201cevery production of child pornography [includes] ... an indecent liberty,\u201d appellant answered, \u201c[n]ot in every one.\u201d We agree. At the time of his offenses, Code \u00a7 18.2-374.1(B)(1) required proof that an adult enticed or solicited a minor \u201cto perform in or be a subject of <em>sexually explicit visual material\u201d </em>which is not a <em>required </em>element of the offense of indecent liberties. (Emphasis added). While Code \u00a7 18.2-370(B) proscribes a person over the age of eighteen from encouraging a minor \u201cto perform in or be subject of sexually explicit material,\u201d the prosecution is not required to prove such an offense in order to obtain a conviction under Code \u00a7 18.2-370. Because Code \u00a7 18.2-370 includes several disjunctive elements, the Commonwealth can obtain a conviction of indecent liberties, even in the absence of evidence that appellant encouraged the victim to perform in or be the subject of sexually explicit visual material. <em>See Dezfuli v. Commonwealth, </em>58 Va.App. 1, 11, 707 S.E.2d 1, 6 (2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b461-7\">Similarly, while sexually explicit visual material includes visual representations that depict \u201ca lewd exhibition of nudity,\u201d Code \u00a7 18.2-374.1(B) was also written in the disjunctive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>and did not require as an element of proof that the perpetrator exposed his or her genital or sexual parts to the victim or proposed that the victim expose his or her sexual or genital parts to such person, which is an element of indecent liberties. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 18.2-874.1(A) (defining sexually explicit visual material to include visual representations of sexual conduct or sadomasochistic abuse); <em>see also </em>Code \u00a7 18.2-390 (defining sexual conduct to include \u201can act of apparent sexual stimulation ... with a person\u2019s <em>clothed </em>or unclothed genitals,\u201d and sadomasochistic abuse as \u201cactual or explicitly simulated flagellation or torture by or upon a person who is nude <em>or clad in undergarments, a mask or bizarre costume </em>...\u201d (emphasis added)). In addition, Code \u00a7 18.2-370 requires that appellant acted with \u201clascivious intent,\u201d whereas then-Code \u00a7 18.2-374.1 contained no equivalent element.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-5\">Because each charged offense required proof of an additional fact that the other did not, the trial court did not err when it denied appellant\u2019s motion to strike the ten indecent liberties charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-6\">C. Indecent Liberties Convictions</p>\n<p id=\"b462-7\">Appellant next contends that the trial court erred in denying his motion to strike ten counts of indecent liberties down to one count because the unit of prosecution for indecent liberties is a common act, scheme, or transaction and not each proposal that a minor expose their private parts. Because \u201cthe ten photographs of the victim were taken over the course of one evening into early the next morning,\u201d appellant contends \u201cthere was clearly only one transaction or scheme ... and that is the unit of prosecution for this offense.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Br. at 20.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-8\">\u201cIn a simultaneous prosecution, the role of the Double Jeopardy Clause is \u2018limited to assuring that the court does not exceed its legislative authorization by imposing multiple punishments for the same offense.\u2019 \u201d <em>De\u2019Armond v. Commonwealth, </em>51 Va.App. 26, 32, 654 S.E.2d 317, 320 (2007) (quoting <em>Stephens v. Commonwealth, </em>263 Va. 58, 62, 557 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>S.E.2d 227, 230 (2002)). However, \u201cconduct may constitute more than one violation of a single criminal proscription.\u201d <em>Jordan v. Commonwealth, </em>2 Va.App. 590, 593, 347 S.E.2d 152, 154 (1986). \u201cWhere the legislature has authorized cumulative punishments, regardless of whether the offenses are the \u2018same,\u2019 the prosecutor may seek and the trial court may impose cumulative punishments in a single trial.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 594, 347 S.E.2d at 154. \u201cThe multiple punishments prohibition, therefore, remains from start to finish wholly dependent on statutory interpretation.\u201d <em>De\u2019Armond, </em>51 Va.App. at 33, 654 S.E.2d at 320 (citing John L. Costello, <em>Virginia Criminal Law &amp; Procedure </em>\u00a7 51.3-4, at 688-90 (3d ed.2002)).</p>\n<p id=\"b463-5\">The trial court convicted appellant of ten violations of Code \u00a7 18.2-370.Code \u00a7 18.2-370(A)(1) states that \u201c[a]ny person 18 years of age or over, who, with lascivious intent, knowingly and intentionally ... propose[s] that any ... child expose his or her sexual or genital parts to such person\u201d is guilty of a Class 5 felony. Under the plain language of the statute, <em>\u201c[t]he simple act of proposing or inviting constitutes the completed crime </em>if the offender is over the age of 18, the act is done with lascivious intent and the victim is under the age of 14.\u201d <em>Hix v. Commonwealth, </em>270 Va. 335, 347, 619 S.E.2d 80, 87 (2005) (emphasis added) (noting that the victim need not \u201cagree to perform any of the acts\u201d). In other words, the gravamen of the offense is the <em>proposal or encowragement </em>to a child, under the age of fourteen, to expose his or her sexual parts. <em>See Baker v. Commonwealth, </em>284 Va. 572, 576, 733 S.E.2d 642, 644-45 (2012) (noting that when determining \u201cwhen one offense ends and the next begins,\u201d courts should determine \u201cthe gravamen of the offense\u201d for which the defendant was convicted). Consistent with this plain reading of Code \u00a7 18.2-370(A)(1), we find that each distinguishable incident in which an adult articulates such a proposal constitutes a violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-370(A)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b463-6\">Code \u00a7 18.2-370(C) adds support to this conclusion. That code section states, in relevant part, that \u201c[a]ny person who is convicted of a second or subsequent violation of this section is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>guilty of a Class 4 felony, provided that ... the offenses were not part of a common act, transaction or scheme.... \u201d Contrary to appellant\u2019s assertions, Code \u00a7 18.2-370(C) by its express terms applies only to enhanced punishments for \u201csecond or subsequent violation[s].\u201d And by permitting enhanced punishment for \u201csecond or subsequent violation[s]\u201d provided the violations \u201cwere not a part of a common act, transaction or scheme,\u201d Code \u00a7 18.2-370(C) underscores the General Assembly\u2019s expressed intent in Code \u00a7 18.2-370(A)(1) that distinguishable proposals are subject to multiple first violation charges, regardless of whether the proposals occurred during a common transaction or scheme.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-4\">We therefore reject appellant\u2019s contention that the trial court erred by denying his motion to strike ten counts of indecent liberties down to one count because the offenses occurred during a common transaction or scheme.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-5\">D. Manufacturing Child Pornography Convictions</p>\n<p id=\"b464-6\">Finally, appellant contends that \u201c[t]he trial court erred when it denied [his] motion to strike [ten] counts of manufacturing child pornography down to [one] count on the grounds that the unit of prosecution for manufacturing child pornography is a common scheme or transaction, and there was only one such scheme or transaction in this case. <em>Mason v. Commonwealth, </em>49 Va.App. 39, 636 S.E.2d 480 (2006), should be overruled because it leads to an absurd result.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b464-7\">\u201c \u2018When considering multiple punishments for a single transaction, the controlling factor is legislative intent.\u2019 \u201d <em>Mason, </em>49 Va.App. at 46, 636 S.E.2d at 483 (quoting <em>Kelsoe v. Commonwealth, </em>226 Va. 197, 199, 308 S.E.2d 104, 104 (1983)). \u201cWhere the legislature has authorized cumulative punishments, regardless of whether the offenses are the \u2018same,\u2019 the prosecutor may seek and the trial court may impose cumulative punishments in a single trial.\u201d <em>Jordan, </em>2 Va.App. at 594, 347 S.E.2d at 154.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-8\">In this case, the trial court convicted appellant of ten violations of Code \u00a7 18.2-374.1(B). Code \u00a7 18.2-374.1(B) pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>scribes the production or attempted production of child pornography, which Code \u00a7 18.2-374.1(A) defines as <em>\u201ca </em>picture, photograph, drawing, sculpture, motion picture film, digital image ... or similar visual representation\u201d depicting lewd conduct or sexual activity. (Emphasis added). As we explained in <em>Mason, </em>\u201c[b]y using the word \u2018a\u2019 followed by a succession of singular nouns in the definition of [child pornography] in Code \u00a7 18.2-374.1(A), the Virginia legislature has demonstrated its clear intent that [production] of a single photograph could constitute an offense under Code \u00a7 18.2-374.1 and that multiple punishments would result from multiple violations of the statute.\u201d 49 Va.App. at 48, 636 S.E.2d at 484; <em>see Papol v. Commonwealth, </em>63 Va.App. 150, 153, 754 S.E.2d 918, 920 (2014) (stating that \u201c[t]his analysis tracks the underlying purpose of the statute to protect children from pornographers, pedophiles, and others who seek to take advantage of their vulnerabilities\u201d). Therefore, we conclude that the number of separate offenses of manufacturing or producing child pornography \u201ccorresponds to the number of individual items of [child pornography].\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b465-5\">Acknowledging this Court\u2019s prior holding that the number of offenses under Code \u00a7 18.2-374.1(B) corresponds to \u201cthe number of pictures or videos,\u201d appellant contends on brief that <em>\u201cMason v. Commonwealth </em>should be overruled because it leads to an absurd result.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Br. at 21-22. The interpanel accord doctrine precludes our reconsideration of <em>Mason. </em>Under that doctrine, a decision from a panel of this Court \u201ccannot be overruled except by the Court of Appeals sitting <em>en banc </em>or by the Virginia Supreme Court.\u201d <em>Clinchfield Coal Co. v. Reed, </em>40 Va.App. 69, 73, 577 S.E.2d 538, 540 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b465-6\">For the foregoing reasons, we conclude that the trial court did not err by denying appellant\u2019s motion to strike.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-7\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b465-8\">For the reasons stated above, we find that the trial court did not err in denying appellant\u2019s motion to dismiss the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>indictments and did not err in denying appellant\u2019s motions to strike the charges of indecent liberties or manufacturing child pornography.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-5\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b450-7\">. Upon delivering these photographs to appellant at the detention center where he was imprisoned, Mason took several sexually explicit photographs of appellant, which Mason later showed to L.M. Appellant was charged and convicted of one count of indecent liberties for those images. Appellant does not challenge that conviction on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b460-13\">. Code \u00a7 18.2-374.1(B)(1) has since been amended to refer to \"child pornography\u2019\u2019 rather than \"sexually explicit visual material.\u201d However, the offense is essentially the same, as the current statute defines child pornography as meaning sexually explicit visual material.
