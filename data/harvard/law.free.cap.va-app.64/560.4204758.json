He argues that the evidence was insufficient to support his conviction because the Commonwealth failed to prove that he was aware that he was under indictment at the time that he completed the form.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We hold that the evidence was sufficient to support the conviction. Consequently, we affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-5\">I. BACKGROUND<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b608-6\">At the appellant\u2019s trial for making a materially false statement on a federal form in connection with a purchase of a firearm, the Commonwealth presented undisputed evidence that the appellant falsely represented on a federal firearms transaction form that he was not \u201cunder indictment or information in any court for a felony, or any other crime, for which the judge could imprison [him] for more than one year.\u201d The only issue that the appellant contested at trial was whether he understood that he was under indictment at the time that he completed the form and attested to its accuracy.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-7\">Jeremy Allen Reynolds testified that on July 7, 2013, he worked as a retail clerk for Bass Pro Shops selling firearms. As part of his employment duties, Reynolds was responsible <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>for administering federal and state firearm transaction forms. The appellant was a customer. Reynolds stated that he gave the appellant the firearm transaction forms and the appellant completed them. He also explained that the store personnel never filled out the forms for the purchasers.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-5\">Over seven weeks before the appellant attempted to buy the firearm, he was indicted for a felony. Twelve days before the attempted purchase, he appeared in circuit court, and his case was continued.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-6\">Brenda Stokes, a Virginia State Trooper, testified that she investigated the appellant\u2019s offense related to his application to buy a firearm. When she interviewed the appellant, he told her that the store clerk completed the application for him. The appellant admitted that he had been arrested and the case was still \u201cpending.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b609-7\">After the close of the Commonwealth\u2019s case-in-chief, the appellant moved to strike the evidence. He argued that the evidence did not prove that he knew that he was under indictment and, as a result, did not support a finding that his giving of a materially false statement was willful and intentional. The trial court denied the motion. In doing so, it observed that the appellant admitted that he had \u201ca ease pending,\u201d which the court described as \u201ca term of art.\u201d The court imputed \u201csome understanding\u201d to the appellant based on his use of the phrase.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-8\">The appellant testified in his defense. He stated that at the time he completed the firearm transaction form he \u201chad no idea what indictment\u201d meant. The appellant acknowledged, however, that he knew his court dates and that he had been charged with a felony. He also admitted that he had appeared in general district court and understood that his case had been transferred to circuit court. The appellant noted one appearance, during which his case was continued in order to appoint a new attorney. He claimed that when he completed the firearm transaction form, Reynolds \u201ctold [him] just to mark no on everything unless [he had] been convicted of a felony.\u201d The appellant explained that although he read the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number>form, he did not do so carefully or completely, and instead relied on Reynolds\u2019 explanation of the form. In response to the court\u2019s questions, the appellant admitted that he specifically read the portion of the form pertaining to an indictment, but added that he did not know what the word meant nor did he ask Reynolds about it.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-5\">After the close of the appellant\u2019s case, he again moved to strike the evidence. He maintained that the Commonwealth failed to prove that he provided the untruthful information in a willful and intentional manner. He relied on <em>Smith v. Commonwealth, </em>282 Va. 449, 718 S.E.2d 452 (2011), to support his argument that the Commonwealth failed to show that he received notice of the indictment or understood the term. The appellant stressed that evidence that he \u201cdidn\u2019t know what indictment meant ... but he answered it anyway\u201d was not sufficient to constitute a violation of the statute. The Commonwealth responded that the length of time that passed between the appellant\u2019s indictment and his attempted firearm purchase, combined with the appellant\u2019s inconsistent statements, provided circumstantial evidence sufficient to support the inference that the appellant knew that he had been indicted.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-6\">The trial court denied the motion and found the appellant guilty of making a materially false statement on a form in connection with a firearm transaction, in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-308.2:2(K). The appellant was sentenced to five years in prison, with all the time suspended.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-7\">II. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b610-8\">The appellant argues that the trial court erred by finding the evidence sufficient to convict him of making a false statement in connection with a firearm transaction. Relying on <em>Smith, </em>282 Va. 449, 718 S.E.2d 452, he contends that the Commonwealth failed to prove that he had actual knowledge that he was under criminal indictment. The Commonwealth responds that <em>Smith </em>is distinguishable because in that case the defendant had not made any court appearances.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>This Court applies a well-established standard when reviewing the sufficiency of the evidence to support a criminal conviction. We examine \u201c\u2018the evidence in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth.\u2019 \u201d <em>Fritter v. Commonwealth, </em>45 Va.App. 345, 351, 610 S.E.2d 887, 890 (2005) (quoting <em>Clark v. Commonwealth, </em>30 Va.App. 406, 409-10, 517 S.E.2d 260, 261 (1999)). In doing so, the Court \u201c \u2018discard[s] all evidence of the accused that conflicts with that of the Commonwealth and regard[s] as true all credible evidence favorable to the Commonwealth and all fair inferences reasonably deducible\u2019 \u201d from that evidence. <em>Henry v. Commonwealth, </em>63 Va.App. 30, 37, 753 S.E.2d 868, 871 (2014) (quoting <em>Holcomb v. Commonwealth, </em>58 Va.App. 339, 346, 709 S.E.2d 711, 714 (2011)).</p>\n<p id=\"b611-5\">The appellant was tried by the circuit court, sitting without a jury. Consequently, that court was the fact finder and its judgment is afforded the same weight as a jury verdict. <em>E.g., Preston v. Commonwealth, </em>281 Va. 52, 57, 704 S.E.2d 127, 129 (2011). In our review of the sufficiency of the evidence, we must affirm the conviction unless the trial court was plainly wrong or the conviction lacked evidence to support it. Code \u00a7 8.01-680; <em>see, e.g., Maldonado-Mejia v. Commonwealth, </em>287 Va. 49, 54, 752 S.E.2d 833, 835 (2014).</p>\n<p id=\"b611-6\">The law is also clear that determining the credibility of the witnesses and the weight afforded the testimony of those witnesses are matters left to the trier of fact. <em>Richardson v. Commonwealth, </em>21 Va.App. 93, 99, 462 S.E.2d 120, 124 (1995). The fact finder is not required to believe all aspects of the testimony of a witness. <em>Moyer v. Commonwealth, </em>33 Va.App. 8, 28, 531 S.E.2d 580, 590 (2000) <em>(en </em>banc). Instead, it may \u201caccept the parts of a witness\u2019 testimony it finds believable and reject other parts as implausible.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Finally, \u201c[i]f the evidence is sufficient to support the conviction,\u201d the reviewing appellate court will not \u201csubstitute its own judgment for that of the trier of fact, even if its opinion might differ from the conclusions reached by the [fact finder].\u201d <em>Jordan v. Commonwealth, </em>286 Va. 153, 156-57, 747 S.E.2d 799, 800 (2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b612-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>It is under these familiar standards that we conduct our review of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-4\">Code \u00a7 18.2-308.2:2(K) provides, in pertinent part, that \u201c[a]ny person willfully and intentionally making a materially false statement ... on such firearm transaction records as may be required by federal law, shall be guilty of a Class 5 felony.\u201d The language of the statute reflects the General Assembly\u2019s intent \u201cto impose upon the Commonwealth a very strict standard of scienter in prosecutions.\u201d <em>Smith, </em>282 Va. at 455, 718 S.E.2d at 455. The Commonwealth is required to prove \u201cthat the defendant had <em>actual knowledge </em>that his statement was false when he made it.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis added). Stated more specifically, \u201c[t]here must be evidence to support a finding that he knew the truth but nevertheless intended to, and did, utter a falsehood.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b612-5\">The appellant\u2019s actual knowledge and intent are factual determinations to be decided by the trier of fact. <em>E.g., Tooke v. Commonwealth, </em>47 Va.App. 759, 766, 627 S.E.2d 533, 536 (2006); <em>Richardson, 21 </em>Va.App. at 99, 462 S.E.2d at 123. A defendant\u2019s intent, due to its very nature, \u201cmay, and often must, be inferred from the facts and circumstances in [the] particular case.\u201d <em>Ridley v. Commonwealth, </em>219 Va. 834, 836, 252 S.E.2d 313, 314 (1979). Circumstantial evidence is treated in the same manner as direct evidence. <em>See Chambliss v. Commonwealth, </em>62 Va.App. 459, 465, 749 S.E.2d 212, 215 (2013). It \u201c \u2018is as competent and is entitled to as much weight.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Salcedo v. Commonwealth, </em>58 Va.App. 525, 535, 712 S.E.2d 8, 12 (2011)).</p>\n<p id=\"b612-6\">The record supports the trial court\u2019s conclusions that the appellant knew that he was under indictment at the time that he completed the form and that he willfully and intentionally provided the false answer. The evidence showed that the appellant had multiple inconsistent explanations of why he answered the question in the manner in which he did. He initially told Trooper Stokes that -the store clerk filled out the form for him. After the clerk contradicted this earlier statement through his testimony that the appellant completed the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>form himself, the appellant testified that he did not read the questions and simply answered all the questions on the form \u201cno\u201d as instructed by the clerk. During cross-examination, the appellant offered a third version of events when he conceded that he had specifically read the question asking whether he had been indicted. The fact finder was entitled to believe the store clerk and infer that the appellant\u2019s inconsistent statements were additional evidence of his guilt. <em>See Taylor v. Commonwealth, </em>61 Va.App. 13, 31, 733 S.E.2d 129, 138 (2012) (\u201c \u2018A defendant\u2019s false statements are probative to show he is trying to conceal his guilt, and thus [are] evidence of his guilt.\u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>Rollston v. Commonwealth, </em>11 Va.App. 535, 548, 399 S.E.2d 823, 831 (1991))); <em>see also Pugliese v. Commonwealth, </em>16 Va.App. 82, 92, 428 S.E.2d 16, 24 (1993) (\u201c[T]he fact finder is not required to believe all aspects of a defendant\u2019s statement or testimony....\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b613-5\">Further, the appellant admitted to Stokes that he had been arrested and that the case was still \u201cpending.\u201d At trial, the appellant acknowledged that at the time he completed the form, he knew he \u201chad been charged under warrants with a felony.\u201d Additionally, the appellant stated that he appeared in general district court and was notified that his ease had transferred to circuit court. He knew that he \u201cwent to court\u201d on July 26 and that his case was continued in order to appoint a new attorney to represent him. The continuance order entered into evidence reflects that the appellant received the continuance in circuit court only twelve days before he attempted to buy the firearm. This evidence supports the findings that the appellant was aware that he was under indictment when he completed the form and knew \u201cthat his statement was false when he made it.\u201d <em>See Smith, </em>282 Va. at 455, 718 S.E.2d at 455.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-6\">The case upon which the appellant relies, <em>Smith, </em>282 Va. 449, 718 S.E.2d 452, does not compel a different outcome. In that case, at the time that the defendant falsely completed the firearm transaction form, he had been arrested on a felony charge and released on bond. <em>Id. </em>at 452, 718 S.E.2d at 453. Although he had received a letter from his attorney stating <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>that his case had been certified to the grand jury, his lawyer had not notified him of his subsequent indictment, which occurred only two days before he attempted to buy a handgun. <em>Id. </em>at 452, 718 S.E.2d at 453-54. Further, Smith had not been arraigned by the circuit court. <em>Id. </em>The Supreme Court has subsequently recognized that circumstantial evidence that a defendant knew that he or she was under indictment can overcome a claim to the contrary. <em>See Maldonado-Mejia, </em>287 Va. at 56, 752 S.E.2d at 836-37.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-5\">Here, consistent with the legal standard espoused in <em>Smith </em>and <em>Maldonado-Mejia, </em>viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, a rational fact finder could have concluded that the appellant had been to court and understood that he was under indictment until his case was resolved. As discussed <em>supra, </em>the witnesses\u2019 testimony, combined with the evidence of the appellant\u2019s court appearances, provided a sufficient basis for the trial court to infer that he knew the meaning of the term \u201cindictment\u201d at the time he completed the federal firearm transaction form. For these reasons, the trial court\u2019s findings that the appellant knew that he was under indictment and acted intentionally and willfully were not plainly wrong or without evidence to support them.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-6\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b614-7\">We hold that the evidence was sufficient to prove that the appellant intentionally and willfully made a materially false statement on a form completed in conjunction with a firearm transaction, in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-308.2:2(K). Consequently, we affirm the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-8\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b608-8\">. The appellant\u2019s single assignment of error reads, \"The trial court erred in convicting Appellant because there was insufficient evidence that Appellant willfully and intentionally made a false statement on a firearm transaction form because there was no evidence that Appellant actually knew he was under indictment at the time he filled out the form.\u201d To the extent that the argument portion of the appellant\u2019s brief appears to question the legal standard applied by the trial court in finding him guilty, his counsel clarified at oral argument that the assignment of error solely challenges the sufficiency of the evidence to support the conviction.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b608-9\">. On appeal, we view \" 'the evidence in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth.\u2019 \u201d <em>Fritter v.
