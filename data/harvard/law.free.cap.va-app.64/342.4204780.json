Layne (claimant) was not entitled to workers\u2019 compensation benefits because claimant committed a willful breach of a workplace safety rule. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 65.2-306(A)(5). On appeal, claimant asserts that there was not a workplace safety rule that applied to the work he was performing at the time of his injury, that the commission applied the wrong legal standard in determining whether his actions were willful for purposes of Code \u00a7 65.2-306(A)(5), and that his actions were at most negligent. For the following reasons, we affirm the commission\u2019s decision in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>I. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b391-4\">Under settled principles of appellate review, we consider the evidence in the light most favorable to employer, as the prevailing party before the commission. <em>Apple Constr. Corp. v. Sexton, </em>44 Va.App. 458, 460, 605 S.E.2d 351, 352 (2004). Consistent with this well-established standard, \u201cwe cannot \u2018retry the facts, reweigh the preponderance of the evidence, or make [our] own determination of the credibility of the witnesses.\u2019 \u201d <em>McKellar v. Northrop Grumman Shipbuilding Inc., </em>63 Va.App. 448, 451, 758 S.E.2d 104, 105 (2014) (quoting <em>Wagner Enters. v. Brooks, </em>12 Va.App. 890, 894, 407 S.E.2d 32, 35 (1991)). \u201cIn addition, the commission\u2019s \u2018conclusions upon conflicting inferences, legitimately drawn from proven facts, are equally binding on appeal.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Watkins v. Halco Eng\u2019g, Inc., </em>225 Va. 97, 101, 300 S.E.2d 761, 763 (1983)).</p>\n<p id=\"b391-5\">In this case, claimant was an employee of Crist Electrical Contractor, Inc. (employer), which was a subcontractor performing electrical work in a massive Lynchburg warehouse owned and operated by Delta Star, Inc. On January 19, 2009, at about 11:30 a.m., claimant was installing electrical conduit from a scissor lift high up in Delta Star\u2019s core cutting room\u2014 and had almost completed installing the conduit. Delta Star\u2019s \u201cbridge crane,\u201d which was operational at that time, hit claimant\u2019s scissor lift \u2014 causing both the scissor lift and claimant to fall far to the floor. Through a personal representative, claimant filed a claim for benefits in the commission alleging injuries to his brain, head, face, spine, and multiple extremities.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b391-6\">Employer acknowledged that claimant\u2019s accident arose out of and occurred in the course of the employment. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 65.2-101. However, employer defended against the claim on the ground that claimant was violating employer\u2019s \u201clockouttagout\u201d rule at the time of the accident. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 65.2-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>306(A)(5). Employer asserted that the bridge crane would not have hit the scissor lift \u2014 and claimant\u2019s resulting injuries would not have occurred \u2014 if claimant had rendered the bridge crane inoperable by following the \u201clockout-tagout\u201d safety procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-4\">The deputy commissioner held an evidentiary hearing on October 20, 2010, when several witnesses testified. The testimony taken at that proceeding establishes that employer hired claimant about four-and-a-half months prior to claimant\u2019s workplace accident on January 19, 2009. Employer assigned claimant the role of \u201celectrician\u2019s helper.\u201d Although an electrician\u2019s helper held the lowest status in employer\u2019s jobsite hierarchy, claimant\u2019s supervisors considered him an \u201cexperienced\u201d helper \u2014 rather than a mere \u201cgreen\u201d helper.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Harry Spruce, a foreman for employer at the time of claimant\u2019s workplace accident, testified that he had known claimant for several years, that he and claimant \u201chad worked together on a couple other projects,\u201d and that claimant \u201cbasically knew what he was doing\u201d because claimant had \u201cbeen in the [electrical] field for a while.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b392-5\">John Crist, employer\u2019s vice president, testified that the Delta Star warehouse\u2019s core cutting room had a bridge crane that moved high above (and horizontal to) the floor. The bridge crane operated on rails that were embedded in the walls of the core cutting room. When the bridge crane\u2019s rails were electrified (or \u201chot\u201d), the bridge crane was able to move. Therefore, before installing conduit or doing other tasks in the bridge crane\u2019s vicinity, the bridge crane and its electrified rails needed to be rendered inoperable through a procedure known as \u201clockout-tagout.\u201d Although it is undisputed that claimant was never given any written materials addressing the \u201clockout-tagout\u201d procedure and did not attend employer\u2019s formal safety orientation, Spruce testified that he gave claimant a tour of the Delta Star facility in which he discussed safety procedures \u2014 including \u201clockout-tagout.\u201d Spruce explained <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>that he had stressed to claimant that open, electrified rails are dangerous and also emphasized the importance of ensuring that the bridge crane was locked out before working in that area.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-4\">Dennis Branham, another of employer\u2019s foremen, testified that he also toured the facility with claimant and told claimant about the importance of the \u201clockout-tagout\u201d procedure. Branham described the \u201clockout-tagout\u201d procedure and explained its importance during the evidentiary hearing. Bran-ham testified that employer\u2019s workers who needed to do work in the path of Delta Star\u2019s bridge crane were required to get the bridge crane operator\u2019s permission to work in that area and ensure that the bridge crane was rendered inoperable. According to Branham, the process of locking out the bridge crane occurs when a person finds the crane\u2019s \u201cdisconnect box,\u201d pulls the \u201chandle down in the off position,\u201d and puts a lock in the \u201choles where that handle comes down.\u201d Branham explained, \u201cYou put your lock through there. That prevents anybody from coming by and pushing that lock up.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> During his examination at the evidentiary hearing, Branham indicated that it does not take \u201ca mechanical engineer\u201d or someone with a \u201chigh level of electrician\u2019s training\u201d to perform the process of applying the lock to the bridge crane\u2019s disconnect box. Branham denied that this procedure was \u201cjust a good idea,\u201d but instead testified that he told claimant, \u201cI said this is our procedure here that we [used] when we work on these cranes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b393-5\">Spruce testified that he \u201cknew [claimant] knew lock out, tag out procedures\u201d based on his interactions with claimant. While the record does not indicate that employer provided claimant with his own lock to be used on the bridge crane\u2019s disconnect box, David Wright, a Delta Star employee, testified that he showed claimant where Delta Star\u2019s locks were in its maintenance department and that he and claimant had locked out the bridge crane together. Clyde Campbell, another Delta Star employee, testified that claimant had informed him on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>several occasions that he was going to lock out the bridge crane. Although Campbell testified that claimant\u2019s helper was with claimant on many of those occasions, Campbell explained that sometimes claimant would do so alone.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-4\">The record shows that claimant successfully locked out the bridge crane on the morning of claimant\u2019s workplace accident \u2014 three hours before the accident occurred. Wright testified that claimant had asked for permission \u201cto lock the [bridge] crane out.\u201d Wright witnessed claimant apply a lock to the crane at approximately 8:30 a.m., thereby rendering the bridge crane inoperable. Claimant did some work from a boom lift for 30 to 45 minutes and then came down from the boom lift. Wright asked claimant if he could again use the bridge crane, and claimant indicated that he could.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-5\">Wright testified that he observed claimant \u201cunlock the [bridge crane disconnect] box\u201d so that the bridge crane could be used again. There is no evidence that the bridge crane was locked out from that point until claimant\u2019s workplace accident occurred at approximately 11:30 a.m. on the same morning\u2014 even though claimant apparently had returned to his work in the core cutting room at about 10:45 a.m., this time using the scissor lift that was then struck by the bridge crane.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-6\">Michael Manning, Delta Star\u2019s bridge crane operator at the time of the accident, testified that the scissor lift was about five feet from the bridge crane\u2019s disconnect box when he arrived at the scene of the accident. Spruce also testified that the scissor lift was \u201cright beside\u201d and \u201c[a]lmost up against\u201d the disconnect box for the bridge crane. Spruce testified that the disconnect box was not locked out and that there was no lock in the area. The evidence was undisputed at the evidentiary hearing that the bridge crane could not operate if the disconnect box had been locked out.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-7\">Following the evidentiary hearing, the deputy commissioner issued an opinion finding that an award of benefits was barred under Code \u00a7 65.2-306(A)(5) because claimant had violated the \u201clockout-tagout\u201d procedure. Claimant sought review by the full commission. The deputy commissioner\u2019s decision was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>affirmed, with one commissioner dissenting, on March 20, 2013. However, in a published opinion, this Court held that the review of the deputy commissioner\u2019s decision had not been conducted by a properly constituted full commission review panel. <em>See Layne v. Crist Electrical Contractor, Inc., </em>62 Va.App. 632, 751 S.E.2d 679 (2013). We reversed the commission\u2019s decision on that specific basis and remanded the matter for reconsideration by a properly constituted full commission review panel \u2014 without addressing the merits of employer\u2019s defense under Code \u00a7 65.2-306(A)(5). <em>Id. </em>at 635 n. 1, 751 S.E.2d at 681 n. 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-4\">On remand from this Court, the full commission issued a second review opinion on May 20, 2014 affirming the deputy commissioner\u2019s decision on the merits, again with one commissioner dissenting.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The full commission\u2019s majority opinion adopted the findings from its first review opinion and expressly held that \u201cclaimant\u2019s conduct was not simply negligent.\u201d Claimant now appeals to this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-5\">II. Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b395-6\">Code \u00a7 65.2-306(A) states, in pertinent part, \u201cNo compensation shall be awarded to the employee or his dependents for an injury or death caused by ... [t]he employee\u2019s willful breach of any reasonable rule or regulation adopted by the employer and brought, prior to the accident, to the knowledge of the employee....\u201d Code \u00a7 65.2-306(A)(5). Under Code \u00a7 65.2-306(B), the party raising a defense under Code \u00a7 65.2-306(A) \u201cshall have the burden of proof with respect thereto.\u201d Therefore, in this case, employer had the burden of satisfying the following elements of the defense under Code \u00a7 65.2-306(A)(5):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-7\">To prevail on the defense of a willful violation of a safety rule, employer must prove that: (1) the safety rule was reasonable;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>(2) the rule was known to the employee; (3) the rule was promulgated for the benefit of the employee; and (4) the employee intentionally undertook the forbidden act. <em>Spruill v. C.W. Wright Construction Co., </em>8 Va.App. 330, 334, 381 S.E.2d 359, 360-61 (1989).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b396-4\"><em>Owens Brockway &amp; Nat\u2019l Union Fire Ins. Co. v. Easter, </em>20 Va.App. 268, 271, 456 S.E.2d 159, 161 (1995); <em>see also Riverside &amp; Dan River Cotton Mills, Inc. v. Thaxton, </em>161 Va. 863, 172 S.E. 261 (1934). Moreover, as the Supreme Court has held,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-5\">If the safety rule is reasonable and is known to the employee and for his benefit, and yet he intentionally does the forbidden act, then he is guilty of wilful misconduct within the meaning of [former] \u00a7 65-35. The employer is not required to prove that the employee, with the rule in mind, purposely determined to break it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b396-6\"><em>Mills v. Virginia Electric &amp; Power Co., </em>197 Va. 547, 552, 90 S.E.2d 124, 127 (1955).</p>\n<p id=\"b396-7\">The Supreme Court in <em>Mills </em>stated, \u201cThe questions of whether or not a claimant has been guilty of wilful misconduct and whether such misconduct was a proximate cause of the employee\u2019s accident are issues of fact.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 551, 90 S.E.2d at 127. The Supreme Court further explained that \u201cthe decision of the Commission \u2018shall be conclusive and binding as to all questions of fact,\u2019 and we have no right to disturb the Commission\u2019s finding of fact if it be supported by credible evidence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting former Code \u00a7 65-94); <em>see </em>Code \u00a7 65.2-706(A) (stating that the commission\u2019s decision \u201cshall be conclusive and binding as to all questions of fact\u201d); <em>see also, e.g., Spruill, 8 </em>Va.App. at 333, 381 S.E.2d at 360; <em>Uninsured Employer\u2019s Fund v. Keppel, </em>1 Va.App. 162, 165, 335 S.E.2d 851, 852 (1985). \u201c[W]e must defer to the commission\u2019s findings of fact if supported by credible evidence in the record.\u201d <em>Diaz v. Wilderness Resort Ass\u2019n, </em>56 Va.App. 104, 114, 691 S.E.2d 517, 522 (2010).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b397-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>A. Existence and Applicability of Safety Rule</p>\n<p id=\"Avj\">In his first assignment of error, claimant contends:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-4\">1. The Commission erred in finding that the employer met its burden of proving the necessary elements of the willful misconduct defense.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-5\">a. The Commission erred in finding that the lockout procedure was a \u201csafety rule.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-6\">b. The Commission erred in finding that the lockout procedure applied to work Layne was performing when he was injured.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b397-7\">Binding case law interpreting Code \u00a7 65.2-306(A)(5) holds that an employer may rely on the existence of a workplace safety rule that has been presented to an employee either in writing or verbally. For example, in <em>Peanut City Iron &amp; Metal Co. v. Jenkins, </em>207 Va. 399, 400, 150 S.E.2d 120, 121 (1966), the Supreme Court stated, \u201cThere was an oral work rule of the company that before an automobile was dismantled with a blow torch air holes were to be made in its gas tank by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>means of an axe or pick.\u201d Likewise, in <em>Phipps v. Rann Industries, Inc., </em>16 Va.App. 394, 396, 429 S.E.2d 886, 887 (1993), this Court observed, \u201cHairfield\u2019s verbal instructions to the employees is Rann\u2019s basis for asserting the existence of the safety rule and the limits of the safety rule.\u201d Thus, because claimant had received verbal directives informing him of the \u201clockout-tagout\u201d rule, his argument on brief that employer\u2019s <em>written </em>\u201clockout-tagout\u201d procedure was insufficient to be a workplace safety rule and that claimant never received a copy of that written procedure cannot, standing alone, defeat employer\u2019s defense under Code \u00a7 65.2-306(A)(5).</p>\n<p id=\"b398-4\">Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to employer (as we must, since the employer prevailed below), the record supports the commission\u2019s finding that employer verbally communicated the \u201clockout-tagout\u201d rule to claimant. Furthermore, the evidence also supports the commission\u2019s finding that the \u201clockout-tagout\u201d rule that employer verbally communicated to claimant actually applied to the work that claimant was performing when he was injured on January 19, 2009.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-5\">Harry Spruce testified that he gave claimant a tour of the Delta Star facility, during which he addressed the need to follow the \u201clockout-tagout\u201d procedure when working near the \u201chot rails\u201d of the bridge crane. Spruce testified that he told claimant to make sure that the crane was locked out \u201cif [claimant] was anywhere around them.\u201d Spruce explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ADd\">I went to each crane rail and showed the disconnects on the crane rail and said that if you\u2019re working in the area of the crane rail it needs to be locked out and tagged out and the [Delta Star] supervisor in that area needs to be told that you [are] going to lock it out. It was up to them when we could lock it out and when we could work in the area and when we couldn\u2019t work in the area.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b398-6\">Spruce indicated that claimant understood employer\u2019s rule relating to this procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-7\">In addition, Dennis Branham testified that he walked through the Delta Star facility with claimant on claimant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>first day with employer. He told claimant that the bridge crane\u2019s rails were \u201cvery dangerous\u201d and specifically warned claimant that, if an employee was \u201cup in a lift,\u201d then the bridge crane \u201ccould hit the lift\u201d if the bridge crane was not locked out. Branham testified that he showed claimant where the \u201clockout boxes\u201d or \u201cdisconnect switches\u201d for the bridge crane were located. He testified that he explained the \u201clockout-tagout\u201d procedure to claimant step-by-step, stating that he told claimant:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b399-4\">These cranes are very dangerous. They are, you can be hit by them, you can shove something into the electrical rods on the side that I showed in the exhibit right there. I said you go to the person operating that crane in that area. You tell that person I have some work over here to do, is it okay. And if the time, if that Delta Star employee says yes you can go ahead; and then you proceed to take your lock, you cut the disconnect off, and you lock it out. You do what work you have there, you get down, make sure everything is out of the way and then you go take your lock off and tell the operator okay, I\u2019m done now. The Delta Star employee can then go back to work.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b399-5\">Branham testified that he told claimant that \u201cthis is our procedure here\u201d when working around a bridge crane \u2014 adding that he had observed claimant working near the bridge crane on several occasions with it properly locked out and inoperable.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-6\">Therefore, based on testimony adduced at the evidentiary hearing, the full commission did not err in determining that claimant was aware of employer\u2019s \u201clockout-tagout\u201d rule communicated by his supervisors \u2014 and that this rule applied to the work claimant was doing at the time of his workplace accident on January 19, 2009.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-7\">B. Willfulness vs. Negligence</p>\n<p id=\"b399-8\">In his second, third, and fourth assignments of error, claimant alleges:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b400-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>2. The commission erred in finding that the claimant \"willfully, knowingly, and/or intentionally violated a known safety rule adopted by the employer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b400-4\">3. The commission erred in finding that the claimant\u2019s conduct was not simply negligent.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b400-5\">4. The commission erred in finding that, to establish a willful violation of a safety rule, an employer does not have to prove that the claimant intended to violate the safety rule.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b400-6\">As an initial matter, claimant challenges (in his fourth assignment of error) the legal standard used by the commission for determining whether a workplace safety rule has been willfully violated for purposes of Code \u00a7 65.2-306(A)(5). Claimant interprets the term \u201cwillful breach\u201d in Code \u00a7 65.2-306(A)(5) to require proof by a preponderance of the evidence that the employee actually intended to violate the workplace safety rule. In other words, claimant asserts that employer was required to prove claimant\u2019s specific intent to break the workplace safety rule at the time that claimant violated the rule. A majority of the full commission disagreed with this position in its May 20, 2014 review opinion, explaining:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b400-7\">To require, as argued by the dissent, the employer to prove the claimant\u2019s state of mind, i.e., that he intended to violate the safety rule, rather than simply that he intended the act which constituted a violation of the rule, would eviscerate the defense [under Code \u00a7 65.2-306(A)(5) ], which defense was specifically provided by the General Assembly.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b400-8\">The commission\u2019s majority opinion specifically denied the dissenting commissioner\u2019s assertion that the \u201cresult here is a <em>per se </em>rule that violating a known and enforced safety rule, even negligently, bars compensation.\u201d Instead, the commission majority opinion explained that the evidence simply \u201cproved the necessary elements of the willful misconduct defense\u201d under binding case law interpreting Code \u00a7 65.2-306(A)(5), that \u201cthe claimant\u2019s conduct was not simply negligent,\u201d and that the evidence \u201cestablished that the claimant intentionally <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>performed the forbidden act, thereby forfeiting his entitlement to benefits.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b401-4\">In its 1934 decision in <em>Riverside &amp; Dan River Cotton Mills, Inc. v. Thaxton, </em>161 Va. at 872, 172 S.E. at 264, the Supreme Court of Virginia interpreted the meaning of the word \u201cwilful\u201d from Section 14 of the former Workmens\u2019 Compensation Act\u2014 which is now Code \u00a7 65.2-306 of the current Workers\u2019 Compensation Act. The Supreme Court explained that willful in this context means \u201cwith deliberate intent.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks and citation omitted). The Supreme Court then held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b401-5\">If the employee knows the rule, and yet intentionally does the forbidden thing, he has wilfully failed to obey the rule. <em>It is not necessary for the employer to show that the employee, having the rule in mind, determined to break it; it is enough to show that, knowing the rule, he intentionally performed the forbidden act.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b401-6\"><em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks and citation omitted). The Supreme Court reaffirmed its <em>Thaxton </em>holding in <em>Griffey v. Clinchfield Coal Corp., </em>183 Va. 715, 720, 33 S.E.2d 178, 180 (1945), and it also recited the same holding from <em>Thaxton, </em>essentially word-for-word, on two subsequent occasions. <em>See Jenkins, </em>207 Va. at 403, 150 S.E.2d at 123; <em>Mills, </em>197 Va. at 552, 90 S.E.2d at 127. Thereafter, this Court has applied the same legal test for determining willfulness under what is currently Code \u00a7 65.2-306(A)(5). <em>See, e.g., Spruill, </em>8 Va.App. at 334, 381 S.E.2d at 361 (\u201cThe defense may be established without the necessity of proving that the employee, with the rule in mind, purposefully determined to break it.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b401-7\">In short, the full commission did not err in assessing whether claimant \u201cintentionally performed the forbidden act\u201d under the \u201clockout-tagout\u201d rule that was communicated to claimant.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> By focusing on whether claimant \u201cintentionally <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>performed the forbidden act,\u201d the commission simply applied the longstanding legal standard that has been used for decades by the Supreme Court and by this Court. Furthermore, the Supreme Court has explained, \u201cThe adverb \u2018intentionally\u2019 is defined as: \u2018To do something purposely and not accidentally.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>Smith v. Commonwealth, </em>282 Va. 449, 454, 718 S.E.2d 452, 455 (2011) (quoting <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>810 (6th ed.1990)). Applying the plain meaning of this term, the commission could infer from the hearing testimony that claimant \u201cintentionally performed the forbidden act\u201d\u2014and, on appeal, we cannot disturb that finding because it was supported by credible evidence in the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-4\">\u201cThe commission is authorized to draw reasonable inferences from the evidence, and on appeal, we will not disturb reasonable inferences drawn by the commission from the facts proven by the evidence presented.\u201d <em>Turf Care, Inc. v. Henson, </em>51 Va.App. 318, 324, 657 S.E.2d 787, 789-90 (2008); <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number><em>see Watkins, </em>225 Va. at 101, 300 S.E.2d at 763; <em>see also S &amp; S Elec., Inc. v. Markulik, </em>61 Va.App. 515, 527, 738 S.E.2d 512, 518 (2013) (noting that, on appeal, the party that prevailed in the commission \u201cbenefits from all reasonable inferences from the evidence\u201d). Here, the commission was faced with two possible inferences from the evidence \u2014 i.e., either (1) that claimant\u2019s violation of the \u201clockout-tagout\u201d rule was accidental and at most negligent (as claimant argues on appeal); or (2) that claimant \u201cintentionally performed the forbidden act\u201d by purposely failing to disable the bridge crane before working in its path, in violation of the \u201clockout-tagout\u201d rule that was communicated to him by his supervisors. The commission weighed the evidence relating to the accident that caused claimant\u2019s very serious injuries and chose to adopt the second of these possible inferences. We may not second-guess or disturb the full commission\u2019s decision to infer that claimant \u201cintentionally performed the forbidden act\u201d because that inference was supported by credible evidence in the record on appeal. <em>See Henson, </em>51 Va.App. at 324, 657 S.E.2d at 789-90; <em>see also Diaz, </em>56 Va.App. at 114, 691 S.E.2d at 522.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-4\">Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to employer, as we must since employer was the prevailing party below, the following evidence in the record supports the full commission\u2019s conclusion here. Both Harry Spruce and Dennis Bran-ham plainly instructed claimant that work was not to be performed in the area of the bridge crane unless the crane was locked out and tagged out. Branham testified credibly that a person did not need to have a mechanical background or be a trained electrician to follow the \u201clockout-tagout\u201d procedure. Indeed, while the \u201clockout-tagout\u201d rule as described by the testimony below was a multi-step process, it had two essential and simple components: (1) to seek and receive permission from the Delta Star bridge crane operator to perform work in the area of the bridge crane; and (2) to render the bridge crane inoperable by engaging the lock in the disconnect box. The evidence proved that claimant had satisfied both of these essential components of the \u201clockout-tagout\u201d rule on prior occasions \u2014 including a mere three hours before <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>the workplace accident that occurred that same morning on January 19, 2009.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> However, the evidence established that claimant had not satisfied either of these essential components as he was working in the path of the bridge crane at the time of the workplace accident later that morning. Claimant not only failed to \u201clock out\u201d the bridge crane \u2014 but he also <em>did not even tell the Delta Star bridge crane operator </em>that he needed to work near the bridge crane or ask for permission to \u201clock out\u201d the bridge crane before he got in the scissor lift and ascended in it to do the work he was doing near the bridge crane when he was injured.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b404-4\">Intent \u201c \u2018is a question of fact to be determined from the evidence.\u2019 \u201d <em>Jacobsen v. Jacobsen, </em>41 Va.App. 582, 590, 586 S.E.2d 896, 899 (2003) (quoting <em>Hall Bldg. Corp. v. Edwards, </em>142 Va. 209, 215, 128 S.E. 521, 523 (1925)). Based on the stark difference between claimant\u2019s past conduct complying with employer\u2019s workplace safety rule and the evidence of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>claimant\u2019s clear disregard of all of the components of this same workplace safety rule directly prior to the accident, the full commission could reasonably infer that claimant deliberately decided not to lock out the bridge crane before beginning work on the lift \u2014 an action that was forbidden by employer. <em>See Mills, </em>197 Va. at 552, 90 S.E.2d at 127. While claimant is correct that negligence \u2014 even gross negligence \u2014 does not bar recovery of workers\u2019 compensation benefits,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> neither the facts of this case nor any prior published decision compelled the commission to find that claimant\u2019s actions were negligent here. The cases relied upon by claimant where negligence, but not willfulness, was proven are distinguishable.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b406-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>Here, claimant, after having followed the workplace safety-rule perfectly just earlier that morning when he locked out the bridge crane before working in that area \u2014 and then unlocked it when he was finished working there \u2014 got into the scissor lift and went up to the area of the bridge crane and worked there without asking a Delta Star employee if he might do so (and without then locking out the bridge crane again). Claimant was then tragically and badly injured when the bridge crane struck the scissor lift and claimant was thrown all the way to the ground below. The Delta Star employee operating the bridge crane did not even know claimant was working nearby as he testified he could not see claimant. As tragic and sad as claimant\u2019s injuries are, they could have been avoided if he had followed the steps of the workplace safety rule that employer had put in place to avoid this sort of outcome \u2014 and which claimant had just perfectly followed only hours earlier that morning.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-4\">A majority of the full commission here found that claimant intentionally committed conduct that was forbidden under the \u201clockout-tagout\u201d rule that had been communicated to him on a number of occasions \u2014 and that, therefore, claimant\u2019s conduct was willful for purposes of Code \u00a7 65.2-306(A)(5). Given that willfulness in this context is a question of fact, <em>Mills, </em>197 Va. at 552, 90 S.E.2d at 127, we must defer to the full commission\u2019s conclusion that claimant\u2019s conduct was willful and \u201cnot simply negligent.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b406-5\">III. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b406-6\">Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to employer (as we must, since the employer was the prevailing party below), the record supports the full commission\u2019s conclusion that the elements of the employer\u2019s affirmative defense under Code \u00a7 65.2-306(A)(5) were proven. Accordingly, for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>foregoing reasons, we affirm the full commission\u2019s decision here.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-4\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b391-7\">. It is undisputed that claimant suffered serious injuries, including brain damage. After a claim for benefits was filed on his behalf, claimant was unable to testify at the evidentiary hearing before the deputy commissioner due to his brain damage.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b392-6\">. In fact, the evidence establishes that claimant often had a less experienced \"helper\u201d of his own assigned to him.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b393-6\">. It appears from the record that \"tagging out\u201d is an alternative means of rendering machinery inoperable.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b395-8\">. Another commissioner wrote a separate concurring opinion, in which he addressed the state of the law relating to the willful misconduct defense under Code \u00a7 65.2-306(A)(5). That commissioner concurred that the elements of the defense had been proven in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b396-8\">. We observe this Court\u2019s statement in <em>Buzzo v. Woolridge Trucking, Inc., </em>17 Va.App. 327, 437 S.E.2d 205 (1993), that \"whether [the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>employee's] conduct in the abstract constitutes willful misconduct is a mixed question of fact and law and is reviewable by this Court on appeal.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 333, 437 S.E.2d at 209. This Court cited as supporting authority the decision in <em>Israel v. Virginia Employment Comm\u2019n, </em>7 Va.App. 169, 172, 372 S.E.2d 207, 209 (1988), which involved misconduct in the context of eligibility to receive unemployment compensation. This Court subsequently has stated that certain specific aspects of the willful misconduct defense for employers in the workers\u2019 compensation context under what is currently Code \u00a7 65.2-306 involve mixed questions of law and fact. <em>See Easter, </em>20 Va.App. at 271-72, 456 S.E.2d at 161 (\"Whether the rule is reasonable and applies to the situation from which the injury results, and whether the claimant knowingly violated it, is a mixed question of law and fact to be decided by the commission and reviewable by this Court.\u201d). At any rate, the only aspect of the willful misconduct defense that the Supreme Court has actually held involves a mixed question of law and fact is whether the employer \"strictly enforced\u201d the workplace safety rule \u2014 an issue not raised in claimant\u2019s assignments of error here. <em>See Peanut City Iron &amp; Metal Co. </em>v. <em>Jenkins, </em>207 Va. 399, 403, 150 S.E.2d 120, 123 (1966) (holding that the issue of whether the rule has been strictly enforced is a mixed question of law and fact). Nevertheless, in this case, for the reasons explained <em>infra, </em>we hold that the commission did not err in applying Code \u00a7 65.2-306(A)(5) and that its findings of fact were supported by credible evidence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b401-8\">. The \"forbidden act,\u201d in the context of the safety rule at issue, has two components:</p>\n<p id=\"b401-9\">(1) ascending in the lift without the approval of the Delta Star crane operator; and (2) failing to \"lock out\u201d in order to disable the crane <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>while doing the work of installing the conduit. Code \u00a7 65.2-306(A)(5) would disqualify claimant from receiving benefits only if both components were willfully violated.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b402-6\">\"Wilful,\u201d as used in the statute, imports something more than a mere exercise of the will in doing the act. It imports a wrongful intention. An intention to do an act that he knows, or ought to know, is wrongful or forbidden by law. It involves the idea of premeditation and determination to do the act, though known to be forbidden.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b402-7\"><em>King v. Empire Collieries Co., </em>148 Va. 585, 590, 139 S.E. 478, 479 (1927).</p>\n<p id=\"b402-8\">Thus, to prevail, employer would have to establish that the claimant intentionally ascended in the lift without the Delta Star crane operator\u2019s approval <em>and </em>that he intentionally failed to disable the crane before doing so.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b402-9\">. Similarly, the United States Supreme Court has noted that one definition of a willful act is \u201can act which is intentional, or knowing, or voluntary, <em>as distinguished from accidental.\" Bryan v. United States, </em>524 U.S. 184, 192 n. 12, 118 S.Ct. 1939, 1945 n. 12, 141 L.Ed.2d 197 (1998) (emphasis added) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). <em>See also id. </em>at 191, 118 S.Ct. at 1944-45 (The word \"willfully\u201d is sometimes said to be \"a word of many meanings\u201d whose construction is often dependent on the context in which it appears.).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b404-5\">. The testimony of Delta Star employee Clyde Campbell and other witnesses establishes that claimant in the past had appropriately communicated with Delta Star employees and had successfully locked out the bridge crane \u2014 including only three hours before his workplace accident. Specifically, Delta Star bridge crane operator David Wright testified that claimant told him at 8:30 a.m. on January 19, 2009 that he needed to work in the area of the bridge crane. Wright then observed claimant lock out the bridge crane using the appropriate disconnect box.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b404-6\">. Michael Manning, the Delta Star employee who was operating the bridge crane at the time of claimant\u2019s accident, testified that no one told him that the crane was not operational or needed to be locked out. He also testified that nobody told him about any work that was being done above the machinery in the core cutting room. Manning explained further that he never actually saw the bridge crane come into contact with claimant\u2019s scissor lift. Clearly, Manning was not even aware that claimant was working in the area until the tragic moment when the bridge crane impacted against claimant's scissor lift. Moreover, claimant was working very near a disconnect box for the bridge crane at the time of the accident, given the testimony of Manning and Spruce that the scissor lift was located within just a few feet of the disconnect box when they arrived at the scene of the accident. However, Spruce testified that the bridge crane had not been \"locked out,\u201d and this testimony was corroborated by the undisputed evidence that a \"locked out\u201d bridge crane is inoperable and cannot move.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b405-4\">. The record indicates that the concurring commissioner in this case was concerned by language in the Supreme Court's decision in <em>Thaxton </em>suggesting that workers' compensation benefits would have been barred in that case even if there was evidence that the employee failed to follow the employer's workplace safety rule \"due to a lapse of memory\u201d on his part. <em>See Thaxton, </em>161 Va. at 870, 172 S.E. at 263. The parties seem to indicate on brief that this portion of the <em>Thaxton </em>opinion was <em>dicta. </em>However, we need not and do not address that point. A majority of the full commission in this case \u2014 whether in the majority opinion or the concurring opinion \u2014 found based on the record in this case that claimant here intentionally committed a forbidden act under the employer\u2019s workplace safety rule that had been communicated to him. <em>See id. </em>at 872, 172 S.E. at 264 (\"[I]t is enough to show that, knowing the rule, [the employee] intentionally performed the forbidden act.\u201d); <em>see also, e.g., Mills, </em>197 Va. at 552, 90 S.E.2d at 127.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b405-5\">. <em>See, e.g., Williams v.
