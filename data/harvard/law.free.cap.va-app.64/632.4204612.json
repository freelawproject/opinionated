Chianelli asserts two assignments of error in support of his appeal. First, he argues that the circuit court erred in \u201cholding that he could not raise a facial challenge to Virginia\u2019s drug paraphernalia statute.\u201d Second, he argues that the circuit court erred in rejecting his challenge to Code \u00a7 18.2-265.3 on the ground that it was unconstitutionally vague as applied to Chianelli\u2019s conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-10\">I. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b681-11\">\u201cOn appeal, we view the facts established at trial in the \u2018light most favorable\u2019 to the prevailing party below, in this case the Commonwealth, and we grant to that party all fair inferences flowing from those facts.\u201d <em>Crawford v. Commonwealth, </em>55 Va.App. 457, 462 n. 1, 686 S.E.2d 557, 559 n. 1 (2009) (citations omitted). In this light, the evidence establishes the following.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"636\">*636</page-number>\n<em>A. The Investigation</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b682-4\">Chianelli has owned and operated Papa Joe\u2019s Smoke Shop (\u201cPapa Joe\u2019s\u201d) in Virginia Beach since 2008. On April 27, 2010, undercover Virginia Beach police detectives Cutler and Shabu visited Papa Joe\u2019s to investigate a complaint that the store was selling suspected drug paraphernalia. Upon first entering the store the officers observed \u201chundreds of bowls,\u201d \u201cbongs,\u201d \u201cdrug test kits,\u201d \u201cliquid detoxification drinks,\u201d \u201cvaporizers,\u201d \u201cgrinders,\u201d \u201chidden concealment devices,\u201d \u201cdigital scales,\u201d \u2014 some of which were designed to look like innocuous items such as a cell phone \u2014 and a \u201chigh end LED grow apparatus.\u201d Throughout the store, there were paraphernalia and memorabilia for sale, such as glass bowls, glass bongs, magazines, stickers, posters,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> etc., that depicted marijuana leaves. There was also a mannequin wearing a \u201cgas mask\u201d \u201cwith a bong apparatus attached to it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b682-5\">The undercover detectives approached the counter and told the clerk that they \u201cwere looking for some glass bowls.\u201d There was a glass display case with a sign that read, \u201cAll pipes are for tobacco use only. All pipes and water pipes are called just that, please do not call them anything else. Any mention of illegal substances will result in refusal of sale, and you\u2019ll be asked to leave. Thank you. Papa Joe\u2019s.\u201d Another sign read, \u201cAll accessory items are for tobacco use only.\u201d Nearby, another sign stated, \u201cIQ test, Can you say water pipe?\u201d After the clerk removed several glass bowls from the display case, and the detectives selected one to purchase, Shabu told Cutler within earshot of the clerk that \u201cI\u2019ll buy the bud, if you buy the bowl.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Cutler turned to the clerk and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"637\">*637</page-number>said \u201cYou heard that right?\u201d to which the clerk said \u201cyeah.\u201d Cutler then asked the clerk directly if they had \u201csome bud in the back,\u201d but the clerk said that they did not \u201chave any of that here.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b683-5\">Before exiting Papa Joe\u2019s, the detectives walked over to a large \u201chigh end,\u201d \u201cLED\u201d light \u201cgrow machine.\u201d Chianelli initiated a conversation with Cutler and Shabu where he described the machine\u2019s attributes. Cutler then said to Shabu, \u201c[w]e can go half on this when you get your paycheck, but then we won\u2019t be able to get any bud for a while.\u201d Shabu said to Chianelli, \u201cI thought it was illegal to sell this stuff in Virginia Beach?\u201d Chianelli responded, \u201cIt\u2019s for tobacco use only.\u201d Shabu replied, \u201cOh, that\u2019s how you get around it?\u201d Chianelli said, \u201c[w]ell, you just have to be discreet about it. Things are a little lax now. They have been a little more laxed [sic] over the past four or five years.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b683-6\">On May 3, 2010, Cutler and Shabu again entered Papa Joe\u2019s in their undercover capacity. The two detectives approached the same clerk and asked about the grow equipment and if the store had sold many of those machines to which the clerk replied no. Cutler stated that he thought this was because a person would have to spend all their money to buy it, then grow it, and \u201cwouldn\u2019t have any bud for a while.\u201d He asked the clerk \u201chow long it would take to grow?\u201d The clerk replied, \u201cSix weeks. Yeah. That stuff grows like weed.\u201d Cutler and Shabu then browsed some other merchandise, and Cutler told the clerk that he would \u201ctake this one-hitter.\u201d A \u201cone hitter\u201d is a small smoking device used to place a small amount of marijuana for \u201cone quick hit.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b683-7\">Finally, on May 5, 2010, Cutler and Shabu returned to Papa Joe\u2019s, this time identifying themselves as police officers investigating the sale of illegal drug paraphernalia, and informed Chianelli that they would be seizing any illegal drug paraphernalia. Chianelli gave the officers permission to search the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"638\">*638</page-number>store. The officers seized and photographed dozens of items. In addition to the items described above, the officers seized what they believed to be synthetic cannabinoids and pouches and cases used to transport pipes and bongs. Inside Chianelli\u2019s back office, the officers saw a sign on the wall that said \u201cMary Jane\u2019s potpourri. Slinging it here,\u201d and another that said \u201c100 percent natural dank on sale here.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Inside his desk, they recovered numerous business cards and advertisements depicting marijuana leaves, a card that depicted a topless woman and read \u201cI love pot,\u201d as well as catalogs featuring various types of glass bongs for sale. The officers did not seize any items that were unrelated to drug paraphernalia such as tobacco products, beer, energy drinks, soft drinks, cigars, cigarettes, humidors, hookahs,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> etc. No marijuana was found on the premises.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-5\">After collecting all the evidence, Cutler advised Chianelli of his rights to counsel and to remain silent, and Chianelli indicated that he understood his rights and then waived those rights to make a statement to the detective. At trial Cutler testified to highlights of their conversation as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b684-6\">[Cutler:] \u201cYou understand customers come in to buy paraphernalia for the purposes of smoking marijuana or other illegal substances with them, correct?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b684-7\">[Chianelli:] \u201cI do understand that.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b684-8\">Hi ^ H* H?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b684-9\">[Chianelli:] \u201cI sell to people who have legitimate medical problems. They don\u2019t like prescription medications.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AL-\">[Cutler:] \u201cYou know that smoking marijuana is illegal in Virginia?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b684-10\">[Chianelli:] \u201cOf course I do.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b684-11\">Hi \u2756 H\u00ed H* ^ H\u00ed</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b685-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"639\">*639</page-number>[Cutler:] \u201cYou do understand that your bongs are used to smoke marijuana, correct?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b685-5\">[Chianelli:] \u201cYes, they can be used to smoke marijuana.\u201d ... \u201cThings [with respect to marijuana] appear to becoming accepted throughout the country.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b685-6\">[Cutler:] \u201cWhy are there marijuana leaves depicted on items for sale in your store?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b685-7\">[Chianelli:] \u201cBecause manufacturers make them that way.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b685-8\">Cutler also advised the store clerk of his constitutional rights to counsel and to remain silent who similarly indicated that he understood his rights and waived those rights to make a statement. Cutler asked the clerk how often people enter the store looking to purchase marijuana. The clerk said, \u201cOnce a month. People ask for marijuana. People know how to talk though. People know what the pipes are used for. If they want to do illegal things on their own time, that\u2019s up to them.\u201d Cutler asked, \u201cYou know that a significant amount of the products here are used to smoke marijuana, right?\u201d He replied \u201cyes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b685-9\">\n<em>B. The Conviction</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b685-10\">Chianelli and the clerk were issued summons and jointly tried in the Virginia Beach General District Court (the \u201cdistrict court\u201d). Both Cutler and Shabu testified as to the details of the investigation of Papa Joe\u2019s as described above. Shabu was qualified as an expert in the field of use, packaging, and distribution of controlled substances, particularly marijuana. Shabu explained the relevance of many of the items and terms that related to marijuana consumption, specifically that many of the items collected from Papa Joe\u2019s were primarily used and designed to smoke or consume marijuana. In his experience, those items were not used in connection \"with tobacco use.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-11\">Chianelli testified in his own defense. He stated that he did not intend to sell any of the items for the use of marijuana, but rather \u201cthe products in the store are sold for the use of tobacco and legitimate herbs that are commercially available <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"640\">*640</page-number>on the market.\u201d In order to ensure that customers understand that the products for sale are not intended to be used for illegal purposes, Chianelli put the signs in the store. According to Chianelli, if a customer said that they wanted to use something for illegal purposes they would be asked to leave immediately. Chianelli said that although he understood that marijuana use is illegal, he did not really understand that the distribution of the products he carried for the use of marijuana was also illegal. He based this assumption on the fact that since he has owned the store, numerous police officers had come in the store and never told him that any of the items he was selling were illegal. Chianelli clarified his statement to the police, i.e., that he understood that some of the products he sold <em>could </em>be used to smoke marijuana but he does not sell them for that purpose. Chianelli testified that \u201conce or twice\u201d he \u201cmay\u201d have sold products to individuals who have prescriptions to smoke marijuana.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-5\">The district court found Chianelli and the clerk guilty of misdemeanor sale of drug paraphernalia in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-265.3. Only Chianelli appealed his conviction to the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-6\">On June 21, 2013, Chianelli moved to dismiss the charge in the circuit court on the ground that \u201cthe statutes prohibiting the sale of drug paraphernalia are unconstitutionally vague.\u201d Specifically, he argued that Code \u00a7 18.2-265.3 (Virginia\u2019s prohibition on the sale of drug paraphernalia) and Code \u00a7 18.2-251.1 (Virginia\u2019s medical marijuana statute) conflict and consequently prevent the average citizen from knowing what conduct is prohibited. Chianelli additionally argued that there was no evidence that he knew or reasonably should have known that his products were designed for unlawful purposes or that he intended that the products be used for unlawful purposes. The circuit court took the matter under advisement, and the parties submitted a transcript of the district court proceedings as stipulated evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-7\">The circuit court issued a detailed fourteen-page letter opinion denying Chianelli\u2019s motion to dismiss. The circuit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"641\">*641</page-number>court found that because Chianelli\u2019s facial challenge to Code \u00a7 18.2-265.3 did not implicate First Amendment concerns, the court would address Chianelli\u2019s vagueness challenge on an as-applied basis. The circuit court held that in conducting an as-applied analysis, Code \u00a7 18.2-265.3 provided Chianelli with sufficient notice of the prohibited activity and was sufficiently definite to avoid arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-5\">Quoting <em>Gonzales v. Carhart, </em>550 U.S. 124, 149, 127 S.Ct. 1610, 1628, 167 L.Ed.2d 480 (2007), the circuit court found that a scienter requirement alleviates vagueness concerns because if the mens rea requirement is met, an individual has a reasonable opportunity to know what conduct was prohibited. The circuit court examined the scienter element of Code \u00a7 18.2-265.3 articulated in <em>Morrison v. Commonwealth, </em>37 Va.App. 273, 557 S.E.2d 724 (2002). In <em>Morrison, </em>this Court held that Code \u00a7 18.2-265.3 requires that the Commonwealth only prove that the seller was aware at the time he sold the items or possessed the items with the intent to sell, that buyers in general are likely to use the items with illegal drugs \u2014 the Commonwealth is not required to prove that a seller knew that particular buyer intended to use them in that fashion. Furthermore, certain items listed in Code \u00a7 18.2-265.1(12) are <em>per se </em>drug paraphernalia because they have no other use than to consume illegal substances.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Because Chianelli possessed with the intent to sell many of the items listed in Code \u00a7 18.2-265.1(12), the circuit court found there was sufficient evidence to find he had the requisite intent under Code \u00a7 18.2-265.3. Moreover, the circuit court noted that Chianelli admitted to the officers that \u201cthe products he sold could be used to smoke marijuana.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b687-6\">The circuit court further concluded that Chianelli had presented no evidence the police enforced the statute arbitrarily by specifically targeting his store, or that they had engaged in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"642\">*642</page-number>a pattern of favoritism. It held that the words of Code \u00a7\u00a7 18.2-265.3 and 18.2-265.1 are precise and readily understood and clearly identify what items are prohibited drug paraphernalia and therefore do not allow individual police officers to decide what conduct is illegal and what is not.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-5\">As to Chianelli\u2019s vagueness argument stemming from an alleged conflict between Code \u00a7 18.2-265.3 and Virginia\u2019s medical marijuana statute, the circuit court held that Chianelli \u201clacked standing to challenge the law on such a theory,\u201d because Chianelli did not sell paraphernalia exclusively to individuals who held a valid prescription for marijuana. The circuit court declined to address such a hypothetical argument as it might apply to third parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-6\">Chianelli entered a conditional guilty plea reserving his right to appeal the circuit court\u2019s denial of his motion to dismiss on vagueness grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-7\">II. Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b688-8\">On appeal, Chianelli first argues that the trial court erred in \u201cholding that he could not raise a facial challenge to Virginia\u2019s drug paraphernalia statute,\u201d and second, he argues that the trial court erred in rejecting his challenge to Code \u00a7 18.2-265.3 on the ground that it was unconstitutionally vague as-applied to Chianelli\u2019s conduct. This Court has not previously addressed the issue of the constitutionality of Code \u00a7 18.2-265.3.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-9\">This Court reviews the constitutionality of statutes <em>de novo. </em>Our review of Chianelli\u2019s arguments is guided by the well-established principle that duly enacted laws are presumed constitutional. <em>See Tanner v. City of Va. Beach, </em>277 Va. 432, 438, 674 S.E.2d 848, 852 (2009). \u201cWe are required to resolve any reasonable doubt concerning the constitutionality of a law in favor of its validity. Thus, if a statute or ordinance can be construed reasonably in a manner that will render its terms definite and sufficient, such an interpretation is required.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 438-39, 674 S.E.2d at 852 (citations omitted). \u201c \u2018Nevertheless, construing statutes to cure constitutional deficiencies is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"643\">*643</page-number>allowed only when such construction is reasonable. A statute cannot be rewritten to bring it within constitutional requirements.\u2019 \u201d <em>Volkswagen v. Smit, </em>279 Va. 327, 336, 689 S.E.2d 679, 684 (2010) (quoting <em>Jaynes v. Commonwealth, </em>276 Va. 443, 464, 666 S.E.2d 303, 314 (2008) (citation omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b689-5\">\n<em>A. Facial Challenge to Code \u00a7 18.2-265.3</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b689-6\">Chianelli first argues that the circuit court erred in holding that he could not raise a facial vagueness challenge to Code \u00a7 18.2-265.3. He asserts that a facial analysis is \u201cwarranted and appropriate\u201d because the statute \u201ccannot be reconciled with Virginia\u2019s medical marijuana statute, and therefore, the entire statutory scheme is unconstitutional on its face.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b689-7\">In this case, the constitutional principles applicable to Chianelli\u2019s vagueness challenge derive from the requirement of fair notice embodied in the Due Process Clause. <em>See Tanner, </em>277 Va. at 439, 674 S.E.2d at 852. Penal statutes must be sufficiently precise and definite to give fair warning to an actor that contemplated conduct is criminal. <em>See id. </em>There are two, independent ways in which a statute can be impermissibly vague. <em>Volkswagen, </em>279 Va. at 337, 689 S.E.2d at 685. \u201c \u2018First, if it fails to provide people of ordinary intelligence a reasonable opportunity to understand what conduct it prohibits,\u2019 \u201d or \u201c \u2018[s]econd, if it authorizes or even encourages arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement.\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Hill v. Colorado, </em>530 U.S. 703, 732, 120 S.Ct. 2480, 2498, 147 L.Ed.2d 597 (2000)).</p>\n<p id=\"b689-9\">However, \u201cvagueness challenges to statutes not threatening First Amendment interests are examined in light of the facts of the case at hand; the statute is judged on an as-applied basis.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 336, 689 S.E.2d at 684 (quoting <em>Motley v. Va. State Bar, </em>260 Va. 243, 247, 536 S.E.2d 97, 99 (2000)). Because our jurisprudence recognizes that a penal statute may be facially valid and yet unconstitutional as-applied in a particular case, \u201c[t]he usual judicial practice is to address an as-applied challenge before a facial challenge.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotations omitted). This method is generally more efficient <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"644\">*644</page-number>because this sequencing decreases the odds that facial attacks will be addressed unnecessarily and avoids encouraging gratuitous wholesale attacks upon state laws. <em>See id. </em>Courts \u201cshould not declare a statute to be wholly unconstitutional unless such a determination is absolutely necessary to decide the merits of the case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 337, 689 S.E.2d at 684.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-5\">In <em>Toghill v. Commonwealth, </em>\u2014 Va. -, -, 768 S.E.2d 674, 678 (2015), the Supreme Court of Virginia recently reaffirmed the rule that an \u201cappellant can only mount a successful facial challenge to a statute by showing first that the statute in question is unconstitutional as applied to him.\u201d Furthermore, \u201cif there is no constitutional defect in the application of the statute to a litigant, he does not have standing to argue that it would be unconstitutional if applied to third parties in hypothetical situations.\u201d <em>MacDonald v. Commonwealth, </em>48 Va.App. 325, 329, 630 S.E.2d 754, 756 (2006) (citing <em>Ulster Cnty. v. Allen, </em>442 U.S. 140, 154-55, 99 S.Ct. 2213, 2223, 60 L.Ed.2d 777 (1979)).</p>\n<p id=\"b690-7\">Therefore, because Chianelli\u2019s argument raises no First Amendment concerns, we must first determine whether Code \u00a7 18.2-265.3 was unconstitutional as-applied to Chianelli\u2019s conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-8\">\n<em>B. As-Applied Challenge to Code \u00a7 18.2-265.3</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b690-9\">Chianelli argues that the circuit court erred in holding that Code \u00a7 18.2-265.3(A) is not vague as-applied to his conduct. Summarizing his argument, Chianelli asserts that the circuit court erred in holding that because he did not exclusively intend to sell products to individuals with medical marijuana prescriptions, his argument was merely hypothetical as-applied to his conduct and he therefore did not have standing to challenge the charging statute on the basis that Code \u00a7\u00a7 18.2-265.3 and 18.2-251.1 conflict.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b691-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"645\">*645</page-number>Pursuant to Code \u00a7 18.2-265.3(A) it is a misdemeanor for</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b691-4\">Any person who sells or possesses with intent to sell drug paraphernalia, knowing, or under circumstances where one reasonably should know, that it is either designed for use or intended by such person for use to illegally plant, propagate, cultivate, grow, harvest, manufacture, compound, convert, produce, process, prepare, test, analyze, pack, repack, store, contain, conceal, inject, ingest, inhale, or otherwise introduce into the human body marijuana or a controlled substance.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b691-5\">In a different section of the Code, Code \u00a7 18.2-251.1, entitled \u201cPossession or distribution of marijuana for medical purposes permitted,\u201d describes three situations involving marijuana where <em>prosecution </em>is prohibited:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b691-6\">A. No person <em>shall be prosecuted </em>under \u00a7 18.2-250 or \u00a7 18.2-250.1 for the possession of marijuana or tetrahydrocannabinol when that possession occurs pursuant to a valid prescription issued by a medical doctor in the course of his professional practice for treatment of cancer or glaucoma.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b691-7\">B. No medical doctor <em>shall be prosecuted </em>under \u00a7 18.2-248 or \u00a7 18.2-248.1 for dispensing or distributing marijuana or tetrahydrocannabinol for medical purposes when such action occurs in the course of his professional practice for treatment of cancer or glaucoma.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b691-8\">C. No pharmacist <em>shall be prosecuted </em>under \u00a7\u00a7 18.2-248 to 18.2-248.1 for dispensing or distributing marijuana or tetrahydrocannabinol to any person who holds a valid prescription of a medical doctor for such substance issued in the course of such doctor\u2019s professional practice for treatment of cancer or glaucoma.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b691-9\">(Emphasis added). Code \u00a7 18.2-251.1 describes three situations involving marijuana where \u201cno person shall be prosecuted\u201d under particular enumerated statutes. It protects pre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"646\">*646</page-number>scription holders from being prosecuted for possession of marijuana under Code \u00a7\u00a7 18.2-250 or 18.2-250.1 and doctors and pharmacists from being prosecuted for distribution of marijuana to valid prescription holders under Code \u00a7\u00a7 18.2-248 or 18.2-248.1. Thus, when attempting to harmonize these statutes, it is important to note that rather than legalizing the possession of marijuana, what Code \u00a7 18.2-251.1 actually does is provide legislative immunity from prosecution to those who meet the statute\u2019s requirements. Code \u00a7 18.2-251.1 unquestionably does <em>not </em>immunize persons selling or intending to sell paraphernalia to an individual <em>without </em>a valid prescription from being prosecuted under Code \u00a7 18.2-265.3(A).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AMX\">Chianelli argues that,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b692-5\">[r]ead together, [Code \u00a7\u00a7 18.2-265.3 and 18.2-251.1] permit the possession of marijuana in some circumstances but categorically prohibit the sale of any item of any nature whatsoever in order to store, process, ingest, etc. that marijuana____[T]his cannot be what the General Assembly intended when it passed the medical marijuana statute, and yet the legislature has provided no guidance on how to resolve the clear conflict between the paraphernalia statutes and the medical marijuana statute.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b692-8\">Chianelli asserts that the legislature has not clearly defined what conduct is to be prohibited because the two statutory schemes are in conflict with each other. Chianelli argues that he is <em>\u201ca </em>legitimate businessperson engaged in retail sales to persons lawfully allowed to possess marijuana.\u201d Because of the conflicting statutes described above, Chianelli argues that the law provides no guidance how he can operate his business \u201cwithout running afoul of the paraphernalia statute.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b693-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"647\">*647</page-number>Chianelli concedes that in order to raise a facial attack, he must first meet the standing requirement that the statute be unconstitutional as-applied to his own conduct. Chianelli is correct that a person \u201cwho engages in some conduct that is clearly proscribed cannot complain of the vagueness of the law as applied to the conduct of others.\u201d <em>Holder v. Humanitarian Law Project, </em>561 U.S. 1, 18-19, 130 S.Ct. 2705, 2719, 177 L.Ed.2d 355 (2010) (quoting <em>Hoffman Estates v. Flipside, Hoffman Estates, Inc., </em>455 U.S. 489, 495, 102 S.Ct. 1186, 1191, 71 L.Ed.2d 362 (1982)). We must \u201c \u2018therefore examine the complainant\u2019s conduct before analyzing other hypothetical applications of the law.\u2019\u201d <em>Commonwealth v. Hicks, </em>267 Va. 573, 580-81, 596 S.E.2d 74, 78 (2004) (quoting <em>Hoffman Estates, </em>455 U.S. at 494-95, 102 S.Ct. at 1191).</p>\n<p id=\"b693-4\">In order to determine whether the statute is unconstitutional as applied to Chianelli\u2019s conduct, we must identify what conduct is at issue. Code \u00a7 18.2-265.3(A) makes it a misdemeanor crime for an individual to sell <em>or </em>possess with the intent to sell drug paraphernalia. In this case, it is unclear from the record whether Chianelli\u2019s conviction was based on the <em>sale </em>of paraphernalia or the <em>possession with intent to sell </em>drug paraphernalia.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> However, under either scenario, the statute is constitutional as-applied to Chianelli\u2019s conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"648\">*648</page-number>If Chianelli\u2019s conviction is based solely on an individual sale to the undercover detectives, that conduct is clearly proscribed conduct because there is no evidence in the record that Chianelli meets the definition of any of those who are immunized from prosecution by the provisions of Code \u00a7 18.2-251.1 or even that the detectives presented a medical marijuana prescription. Therefore, Code \u00a7 18.2-265.3(A) is clearly constitutional as-applied to Chianelli\u2019s sale of narcotics paraphernalia to the undercover detectives. <em>See MacDonald, </em>48 Va.App. at 332, 630 S.E.2d at 758 (concluding that the appellant\u2019s as-applied challenge failed because application of the statute to his conduct had no adverse impact on his personal due process rights).</p>\n<p id=\"b694-4\">If Chianelli\u2019s conviction is based on possession with intent to sell drug paraphernalia, Code \u00a7 18.2-265.3(A) is also constitutional as-applied to Chianelli\u2019s conduct because there is ample evidence in the record that he possessed items that <em>per se </em>constituted drug paraphernalia under the holding of <em>Morrison </em>and did so with intent to sell to non-prescription holders-conduct that is clearly prohibited by Code \u00a7 18.2-265.3(A) and not immunized by Code \u00a7 18.2-251.1. <em>See, e.g., Hoffman Estates, </em>455 U.S. at 500, 102 S.Ct. at 1194 (holding that the appellant\u2019s as-applied vagueness challenge failed because \u201cat least some of the items sold\u201d were proscribed by the statute); <em>see also Boyd v. Cnty. of Henrico, </em>42 Va.App. 495, 519, 592 S.E.2d 768, 780 (2004) (en banc) (stating that one who engages in \u201csome conduct that is clearly proscribed cannot complain of the vagueness of the law\u201d). Moreover, the record is clear that Chianelli acknowledged his conduct was illegal in Virginia.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-5\">Chianelli sold items that are intended to conceal marijuana and drug paraphernalia, and digital scales designed to look like innocuous items. When he told the detectives that the paraphernalia was for tobacco use only and they asked if that\u2019s how he \u201cgot around it,\u201d he responded that you \u201cjust have to be discreet about it\u201d and that things were \u201ca little lax now.\u201d He also stated that although he knew smoking marijuana was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"649\">*649</page-number>illegal in Virginia, things appeared to be \u201cbecoming more accepted in this county.\u201d He acknowledged that people came into his store to buy paraphernalia for the purposes of smoking marijuana. Although he stated he sold to people with \u201clegitimate medical problems\u201d who \u201cdon\u2019t like prescription medications,\u201d he never suggested that he required them to produce a medical marijuana prescription. The record is devoid of evidence that would suggest Chianelli had any intention to sell paraphernalia to medical marijuana prescription holders. The store was littered in signs that said that the products were intended for tobacco use only. He testified on the stand that he intended to sell the paraphernalia for tobacco use only, not for marijuana consumption. Chianelli\u2019s repeated insistence that he intended to sell the items for tobacco use only demonstrates that he was well aware that selling drug paraphernalia for marijuana consumption was illegal. He never suggested that he only intended to sell items to individuals with medical marijuana prescriptions.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-5\">Therefore, Code \u00a7 18.2-265.3(A) is constitutional as-applied to Chianelli\u2019s conduct because there is ample evidence in the record that he possessed drug paraphernalia with intent to sell to non-prescription holders \u2014 conduct that is clearly prohibited by the statute. Because the statute is not unconstitutionally vague as-applied to Chianelli\u2019s conduct, we cannot engage in a facial analysis of a purely hypothetical conflict between the paraphernalia statute and the medical marijuana statute. <em>See Turner v. Jackson, </em>14 Va.App. 423, 433, 417 S.E.2d 881, 888 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b695-6\">III. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b695-7\">For the reasons stated above, Code \u00a7 18.2-265.3(A) is not unconstitutionally vague as-applied to Chianelli\u2019s conduct, and accordingly, we affirm his conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-8\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b682-6\">.

The <em>Morrison </em>Court based its holding on the United States Supreme Court\u2019s interpretation of an almost identically worded federal statute, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 863, in <em>Posters \u2018N\u2019 Things, Ltd. v. United States, </em>511 U.S. 513, 114 S.Ct. 1747, 128 L.Ed.2d 539 (1994).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b690-10\">. Despite the Commonwealth\u2019s claim that the circuit court made a factual finding that Chianelli was not in the business of selling paraphernalia to people with prescriptions for marijuana, the circuit court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"645\">*645</page-number>only concluded that he did \"not sell paraphernalia <em>only </em>to those who hold a valid prescription for marijuana.\"</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b692-9\">. For the reasons explained below, we need not today decide the applicability of Code \u00a7 18.2-265.3(A) to those selling or intending to sell drug paraphernalia to valid prescription holders because doing so would constitute an improper advisory opinion. <em>See Commonwealth v. Harley, 256 </em>Va. 216, 220, 504 S.E.2d 852, 854 (1998) (stating that courts may not render advisory opinions \" \u2018to answer inquires that are merely speculative\u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>City of Fairfax v.
