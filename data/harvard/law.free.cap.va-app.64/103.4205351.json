(\u201cemployer\u201d) appeals a decision of the Virginia Workers\u2019 Compensation Commission (\u201ccommission\u201d) finding that .Elizabeth A. Wilson (\u201cclaimant\u201d) suffered a compensable injury. On appeal, employer asserts that the commission \u201cerred in finding that the claimant sustained a compensable injury by accident arising out of her employment, given that the evidence did not prove that the injury was caused by an actual risk of the employment or an actual risk inherent and unique to the employment.\u201d For the following reasons, this Court affirms the commission\u2019s ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-9\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b151-10\">On appeals from the commission, \u201cwe review the evidence in the light most favorable to the prevailing party.\u201d <em>R.G. Moore Bldg. Corp. v. Mullins, </em>10 Va.App. 211, 212, 390 S.E.2d 788, 788 (1990). If supported by credible evidence, the commission\u2019s factual findings are \u201cbinding on appeal,\u201d <em>Tomes v. James City Fire, </em>39 Va.App. 424, 430, 573 S.E.2d 312, 315 (2002), \u201ceven though there is evidence in the record to support a contrary finding,\u201d <em>Morris v. Badger Powhatan/Figgie Int\u2019l, Inc., </em>3 Va.App. 276, 279, 348 S.E.2d 876, 877 (1986). When \u201cdetermining whether credible evidence exists,\u201d we cannot \u201cretry the facts, reweigh the preponderance of the evidence, or make [our] own determination of the credibility of the witnesses.\u201d <em>Wagner Enters. v. Brooks, </em>12 Va.App. 890, 894, 407 S.E.2d 32, 35 (1991). In addition, the commission\u2019s \u201cconclusions upon conflicting inferences, legitimately drawn from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>proven facts, are equally binding on appeal.\u201d <em>Watkins v. Halco Eng\u2019g, Inc., </em>225 Va. 97, 101, 300 S.E.2d 761, 763 (1983). So viewed, the evidence is as follows.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-4\">On October 21, 2011, claimant was employed as the manager of the Dollar Tree Store in Altavista, Virginia. The store\u2019s layout, at that time, consisted of aisles, \u201cgondolas,\u201d and \u201cend caps\u201d for product displays and sale to the general public. The store also had four cash registers. At the front of one of the registers was a water display stack (\u201cwater stack\u201d), which consisted of cases of one-gallon water containers that were stacked three cases deep and three cases wide.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-5\">As store manager, claimant was responsible for \u201cclosing out\u201d the store\u2019s registers at the end of each day. Around closing time on the day of the incident, claimant \u201cclosed out\u201d a register that Robin East (\u201cEast\u201d), a store employee, had been using. Claimant handed East the register drawer, and East started walking with the drawer towards claimant\u2019s office. Claimant turned to follow East, but \u201ccaught [her] foot on [the water] stack\u201d as she was going \u201caround the end of the ... register.\u201d Claimant \u201cgrabbed the end of the register\u201d to keep herself from falling, but testified that she felt \u201cimmediate pain.\u201d Additionally, claimant testified that she did not have to \u201cturn sideways,\u201d \u201cback up,\u201d or \u201cwalk unusually\u201d to get past the water stack.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-6\">After tripping over the water stack, claimant did not initially realize how \u201csevere ... it was.\u201d Consequently, she finished closing down the store for the day. A week later, however, claimant sought medical attention from Dr. Robert Sydnor (\u201cSydnor\u201d). An MRI revealed \u201ca nondisplaced stress fracture at the left femoral neck and low grade stress reaction of the right femoral neck.\u201d Claimant underwent surgery to repair the fracture, and Sydnor released her to return to light-duty work on December 21, 2011. Claimant resumed earning her usual salary on December 25, 2011, although she did not return to work until January 3, 2012. Sydnor released claimant of all restrictions on March 13, 2012.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>Claimant filed a claim with the commission on February 9, 2012 seeking temporary total disability benefits from October 22, 2011 through December 28, 2011 and temporary partial disability benefits from December 29, 2011 through March 12, 2012. On August 9, 2012, the deputy commissioner denied the claim for benefits, holding that claimant failed to meet her burden of establishing that her injury arose out of her employment. Claimant appealed this decision to the full commission, which reversed the deputy commissioner, holding that the water stack constituted a \u201cworkplace hazard,\u201d and remanded the case for consideration of remaining issues. On remand, the deputy commissioner held that claimant suffered a compensable injury by accident and awarded claimant various periods of temporary total and temporary partial disability benefits. Employer appealed this decision to the full commission, which affirmed the deputy commissioner\u2019s finding of a compensable injury by accident, but modified the compensation award. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-4\">II. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b153-5\">On appeal, employer contends that the commission erred by finding that claimant suffered a compensable injury. Specifically, employer argues there was no evidence showing that claimant\u2019s injury arose out of her employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-6\">\u201cWhether an injury arises out of ... employment involves a mixed question of law and fact, which we review <em>de novo </em>on appeal.\u201d <em>Blaustein v. Mitre Corp., </em>36 Va.App. 344, 348, 550 S.E.2d 336, 338 (2001) (citing <em>Norfolk Community Hosp. v. Smith, </em>33 Va.App. 1, 4, 531 S.E.2d 576, 578 (2000)); <em>see also Dublin Garment Co. v. Jones, </em>2 Va.App. 165, 167, 342 S.E.2d 638, 638 (1986). On review to this Court, \u201c \u2018[decisions of the commission as to questions of fact, if supported by credible evidence, are conclusive and binding on this Court.\u2019 \u201d <em>VFP, Inc. v. Shepherd, </em>39 Va.App. 289, 292, 572 S.E.2d 510, 511 (2002) (quoting <em>WLR Foods v. Cardosa, </em>26 Va.App. 220, 230, 494 S.E.2d 147, 152 (1997)).</p>\n<p id=\"b154-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>Under Virginia\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation statutes, \u201c \u2018injury\u2019 means only injury by accident arising out of and in the course of the employment.\u201d Code \u00a7 65.2-101.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b154-4\">Thus, for an injury to be compensable under the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, the claimant must prove by a preponderance of the evidence three elements: (1) that the injury was caused by an accident; (2) that the injury was sustained in the course of the employment; and (3) that the injury arose out of the employment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b154-5\"><em>Southland Corp. v. Parson, </em>1 Va.App. 281, 283-84, 338 S.E.2d 162, 163 (1985). The \u201cconcepts \u2018arising out of and \u2018in the course of employment are not synonymous and both conditions must be proved before compensation will be awarded.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>PYA/Monarch &amp; Reliance Ins. Co. v. Harris, </em>22 Va.App. 215, 221, 468 S.E.2d 688, 689 (1996) (quoting <em>Marketing Profiles, Inc. v. Hill, </em>17 Va.App. 431, 433, 437 S.E.2d 727, 729 (1993) <em>(en banc)).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b154-6\">Virginia adheres to the actual risk test to determine whether an injury arises out of the employment. <em>Cnty. of Chesterfield v. Johnson, </em>237 Va. 180, 185, 376 S.E.2d 73, 75-76 (1989). \u201cThe phrase arising \u2018out of refers to the origin or cause of the injury.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 183, 376 S.E.2d at 74. Under the actual risk test, an injury arises out of the employment when \u201c \u2018there is apparent to the rational mind upon consideration of all the circumstances, a causal connection between the conditions under which the work is required to be performed and the resulting injury.\u2019 \u201d <em>Marketing Profiles, </em>17 Va.App. at 434, 437 S.E.2d at 729 (quoting <em>Bradshaw v. Aronovitch, </em>170 Va. 329, 335, 196 S.E. 684, 686 (1938)). Conversely,</p>\n<p id=\"ALG\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number><em>Vint v. Alleghany Reg\u2019l Hosp., </em>32 Va.App. 60, 63-64, 526 S.E.2d 295, 297 (2000) (quoting <em>Bradshaw, </em>170 Va. at 335, 196 S.E. at 686).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b154-7\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>[a]n injury does not arise out of the employment when it \u201ccannot fairly be traced to the employment as a contributing proximate cause and ... comes from a hazard to which the workmen would have been equally exposed apart from the employment. The causative danger must be peculiar to the work and not common to the neighborhood.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b155-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>In the present case, this Court holds that the commission did not err by concluding that claimant\u2019s injury arose out of her employment. Specifically, claimant\u2019s employment required her to maneuver around the water stack after closing out the register for the day. As she was doing so, her left foot caught the corner of the water stack, resulting in the injury. The commission found, as a matter of fact, that the water stack was a hazard peculiar to the workplace when it identified the stack as a \u201cworkplace hazard.\u201d On appeal, this Court cannot disturb this factual determination as it is supported by credible evidence. <em>See Diaz v. Wilderness Resort Ass\u2019n, </em>56 Va.App. 104, 114, 691 S.E.2d 517, 522 (2010) (\u201c[W]e must defer to the commission\u2019s findings of fact if supported by credible evidence in the record.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b155-5\">The present case is distinguishable from this Court\u2019s unpublished opinion in <em>Jennings v. Richmond Pub. Schs., </em>No. 2497-11-2, 2012 WL 2378611, 2012 Va.App. LEXIS 212 (Va.Ct.App. June 26, 2012), upon which employer relies. In <em>Jennings, </em>the claimant tripped over the threshold of a doorway, resulting in injury. The commission, sitting as the trier of fact, found \u201cno evidence that the threshold was unusual\u201d or \u201cdefective in any way.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at *1, 2012 Va.App. LEXIS 212 at *2. As such, it did not constitute a hazard peculiar to the claimant\u2019s employment. By contrast, in the present case, the commission was entitled to conclude that the water stack, around which claimant was required to maneuver as a part of her employment, was peculiar to claimant\u2019s workplace and not \u201ccommon to the neighborhood.\u201d <em>Bradshaw, </em>170 Va. at 335, 196 S.E. at 686.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-6\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b155-7\">For the foregoing reasons, this Court affirms the commission\u2019s ruling that claimant\u2019s injury arose out of her employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-8\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b154-8\">.
