HUFF, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b107-12\">Gene Anthony Brown (\u201cappellant\u201d) appeals his convictions of first-degree murder, in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-32, use of a firearm in the commission of first-degree murder, in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-53.1, and possession of a firearm by a convicted felon, in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-308.2. Following a jury trial in the Circuit Court of the City of Roanoke (\u201ctrial court\u201d), appellant was sentenced to a total of forty three years\u2019 incarceration in the Department of Corrections. On appeal, appellant first argues that \u201c[t]he trial court erred by wrongfully removing juror [M.B.] from the jury without cause.\u201d Next, appellant argues \u201c[t]he trial court erred by denying [appellant\u2019s] alternate motion for [a] mistrial on account of the wrongful removal of juror [M.B.]\u201d For the following reasons, this Court affirms the trial court\u2019s rulings.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-13\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b107-14\">On appeal, \u201c 'we consider the evidence and all reasonable inferences flowing from that evidence in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, the prevailing party at trial.\u2019 \u201d <em>Williams v. Commonwealth, </em>49 Va.App. 439, 442, 642 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>S.E.2d 295, 296 (2007) <em>(en </em>banc) (quoting <em>Jackson v. Commonwealth, </em>267 Va. 666, 672, 594 S.E.2d 595, 598 (2004)). So viewed, the evidence is as follows.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-5\">In the August 2011 term, a grand jury empaneled by the trial court indicted appellant for first-degree murder, in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-32, use of a firearm in the commission of first-degree murder, in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-53.1, and possession of a firearm by a convicted felon, in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-308.2. A three-day trial ensued, and appellant was convicted of all three charges.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> At the outset of appellant\u2019s trial, the trial court began the jury selection process with a pool of twenty-three prospective jurors. At the conclusion of <em>voir dire, </em>each side exercised five peremptory strikes, leaving a thirteen-member jury \u2014 twelve regular jurors and one alternate, who was to be selected at random. Without objection, the thirteen jurors were seated, and M.S. was randomly chosen as the alternate.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-6\">Following lunch on the first day of appellant\u2019s trial, one of the regular jurors, M.B., informed the trial court that a young woman, whose name she did not know, \u201crecognized\u201d her as she exited the elevator in the courthouse. The woman informed M.B. that her grandparents live \u201cdown the street\u201d from M.B.\u2019s house. M.B. told the trial court that she had not noticed the woman at the outset of the proceedings, but later realized that the woman \u201cwas with ... [appellant\u2019s] party.\u201d Additionally, M.B. informed the trial court that she is \u201ca single parent\u201d and that she \u201c[doesn\u2019t] want to have any problems.\u201d When the trial court asked if M.B. thought the woman was threatening her, M.B. responded, \u201cNo, no, no, ... but it just worries me that someone knows where I live.\u201d The trial judge returned M.B. to the jury, and appellant\u2019s trial proceeded.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-7\">On the second day of appellant\u2019s trial, the Commonwealth moved for the trial court to excuse M.B. for cause and replace <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>her with M.S., the alternate juror. Specifically, the Commonwealth was concerned that M.B. may be considering \u201cthings other than the law and the evidence.\u201d The trial court agreed that the Commonwealth\u2019s concern was \u201clegitimate,\u201d but nevertheless took the Commonwealth\u2019s request \u201cunder advisement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b109-5\">On the morning of the third day of appellant\u2019s trial, the Commonwealth renewed its motion to replace M.B. with M.S. on the ground that M.B. \u201cmay be taking into account [other concerns] other than the law and the evidence.\u201d Appellant objected to the Commonwealth\u2019s motion, arguing that M.B. had \u201cbeen one of the more attentive jurors in the whole case.\u201d The trial court decided to bring M.B. back into the courtroom to further inquire about her encounter with the young woman outside of the elevator.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-6\">M.B. informed the trial court that she told the other jurors that the encounter with the woman made her \u201cfeel scared; especially, someone knowing where [she] live[s].\u201d In response to a question by appellant\u2019s counsel, M.B. stated that the jury \u201cexpressed] a ... belief to [her] that it would concern them as well.\u201d She later clarified, however, that the jury meant that they would be concerned if they were in M.B.\u2019s position, not that they were concerned for themselves. Finally, M.B. stated that she did not feel \u201cdistracted by knowing that ... the connection was made.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b109-7\">The Commonwealth again asserted its desire to have M.B. replaced with M.S. Appellant opposed the Commonwealth\u2019s motion to replace M.B., but alternatively moved for a mistrial arguing that \u201cif [M.B.] is tainted to the degree that the Commonwealth believes, I don\u2019t think that you could say that the rest of the jury is not tainted as well.\u201d The trial court subsequently ruled on both motions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b109-8\">So, what I\u2019d like to do, probably over the objection of both sides ... I\u2019d like to keep [M.B.] on the jury for right now. But, then, excuse her for cause before deliberation and substitute the ... alternate for her....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b109-9\">I think that from what [M.B.] said, in terms of the jury ... not being individually alarmed, that we are going to have to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>keep going forward. And, I deny [appellant\u2019s] motion for a mistrial.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b110-5\">At the end of closing arguments, the trial court submitted the case to the jury, but waited for the bailiff to return with M.B. The trial court then informed M.B. that she was excused from the jury because \u201cjust twelve (12) [jurors] are going to hear the matter.\u201d This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-6\">II. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"AfQ\">A. Juror M.B.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-7\">On appeal, appellant first argues that the trial court erred by removing M.B. for cause. Specifically, appellant argues that when one looks at M.B.\u2019s <em>voir dire </em>as a whole, there was no evidence to support the conclusion that M.B. could not weigh the evidence impartially and without distraction. Additionally, appellant argues that even if there was a reasonable doubt regarding M.B.\u2019s ability to remain impartial, such doubt should have been resolved in appellant\u2019s favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-8\">Code \u00a7 8.01-361 provides, in pertinent part, that \u201c[i]f a juror, after he is sworn, be unable from any cause to perform his duty, the court may, in its discretion, cause another qualified juror to be sworn in his place....\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> \u201c[T]rial courts have discretion to determine the appropriate solution when jury problems arise.\u201d <em>Waddler v. Commonwealth, </em>50 Va.App. 113, 117, 646 S.E.2d 896, 898 (2007) (citing <em>Satcher v. Commonwealth, </em>244 Va. 220, 238, 421 S.E.2d 821, 832 (1992) (\u201cthe manner of proceeding under the circumstances [is] a matter for the exercise of the trial court\u2019s discretion\u201d)); <em>see also Irving v. Commonwealth, </em>19 Va.App. 581, 584, 453 S.E.2d 577, 579 (1995) (\u201cCode \u00a7 8.01-361 allows the court in its discretion 'to cause another qualified juror to be sworn in\u2019 to replace the juror who is unable to serve.... \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b111-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>In the present case, the trial court acted within its discretion when it replaced M.B. with the alternate juror. M.B. informed the trial court that she was scared and worried as a result of her interaction with the young woman. From this, the trial court reasonably questioned M.B.\u2019s ability to remain impartial and whether M.B. may consider \u201cthings other than the law and evidence.\u201d Accordingly, from the record before us, this Court cannot say that the trial court abused its discretion by removing M.B. from the jury and replacing her with the alternate.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b111-5\">Nevertheless, appellant argues that this Court should reverse the trial court\u2019s decision to remove M.B. because, \u201cby ancient rule, any reasonable doubt as to a juror\u2019s qualifications must be resolved in favor of the accused.\u201d <em>Green v. Commonwealth, </em>262 Va. 105, 117, 546 S.E.2d 446, 452 (2001). Appellant argues that if a reasonable doubt existed as to M.B.\u2019s impartiality, the issue must be resolved in his favor \u2014 resulting in M.B. remaining on the jury. Appellant\u2019s attempt to apply this \u201cancient rule\u201d to the present case, however, is misplaced.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-6\">In <em>Wright v. Commonwealth, </em>73 Va. (32 Gratt.) 941, 943 (1879), the Supreme Court held that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b111-7\">[A prospective juror] must be able to give [the accused] a fair and impartial trial. Upon this point nothing should be left to inference or doubt. All the tests applied by the courts, all the enquiries made into the state of the juror\u2019s mind, are merely to ascertain whether he comes to the trial free from partiality and prejudice.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b112-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>\n<em>If there be a reasonable doubt whether the juror possesses these qualifications, that doubt is sufficient to insure his exclusion.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b112-5\">(Emphasis added). The Court went on to explain that the reason for such a rule is that \u201cit is not only important that justice should be impartially administered, but it should also flow through channels as free from suspicion as possible.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b112-6\">Nearly one-hundred years later, the Supreme Court, citing to <em>Wright, </em>noted that \u201cby ancient rule, any reasonable doubt as to a juror\u2019s qualifications <em>must be resolved in favor of the accused.\u201d Breeden v. Commonwealth, 217 </em>Va. 297, 298, 227 S.E.2d 734, 735 (1976) (emphasis added); <em>see also Green, </em>262 Va. at 117, 546 S.E.2d at 452 (\u201cby ancient rule, any reasonable doubt as to a juror\u2019s qualifications must be resolved in favor of the accused\u201d). Relying on <em>Green, </em>appellant argues that whenever there is a reasonable doubt regarding the impartiality <em>of </em>a juror, the accused, by \u201cancient rule,\u201d has the right to decide whether the juror will remain on the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-7\">Contrary to appellant\u2019s argument, the \u201cancient rule\u201d upon which he relies has never provided an accused with the ability to keep a juror whose impartiality can be reasonably questioned on the jury. Rather, the original justification of the rule, and its application in subsequent cases, demonstrate that its purpose is to \u201cinsure [a juror\u2019s] <em>exclusion \u201cfrom </em>the jury when there is a reasonable doubt about that juror\u2019s ability\u201d to give [the accused] a fair and impartial trial.\u201d <em>Wright, 73 </em>Va. (32 Gratt.) at 943 (emphasis added). Phrased differently, the \u201cancient rule\u201d that \u201cany reasonable doubt as to a juror\u2019s qualifications must be resolved in favor of the accused,\u201d <em>Green, </em>262 Va. at 117, 546 S.E.2d at 452, does not give an accused the final say as to whether a potentially biased juror is removed, but rather, it requires that juror\u2019s dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-8\">This rule not only ensures that justice is \u201cimpartially administered,\u201d but also ensures that it flows \u201cthrough channels as free from suspicion as possible.\u201d <em>Wright, </em>73 Va. (32 Gratt.) at 943; <em>see also Breeden, </em>217 Va. at 298, 227 S.E.2d at 735 (application of this ancient rule ensures an accused\u2019s constitu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>tional right \u201cto trial by \u2018an impartial jury,\u2019 \u201d which demands that \u201cveniremen must stand indifferent in the cause\u201d (quoting U.S. Const, amend. VI)). Indeed, contrary to appellant\u2019s argument, application of the rule to the present case would result in dismissing M.B. from the jury, not retaining her. Accordingly, appellant\u2019s argument fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-5\">B. Mistrial</p>\n<p id=\"b113-6\">In his second assignment of error, appellant alleges that the trial court erred by denying appellant\u2019s motion for a mistrial. Specifically, appellant argues that he was prejudiced because M.B. was one of the more attentive jurors. Additionally, appellant argues that if M.B. was tainted by her encounter with the young woman so as to justify her removal, then the rest of the jury must have also been tainted.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-7\">Under settled principles of appellate review, \u201cthe party moving for a mistrial ... has the burden of establishing a manifest probability of prejudice.\u201d <em>Perez v. Commonwealth, </em>40 Va.App. 648, 655, 580 S.E.2d 507, 510 (2003). Thus, on appeal \u201cthe denial of a motion for a mistrial will not be overruled unless there exists a manifest probability that the denial of a mistrial was prejudicial.\u201d <em>Harward v. Commonwealth, </em>5 Va.App. 468, 478, 364 S.E.2d 511, 516 (1988) (citing <em>LeVasseur v. Commonwealth, </em>225 Va. 564, 589, 304 S.E.2d 644, 657 (1983), <em>cert. denied, </em>464 U.S. 1063, 104 S.Ct. 744, 79 L.Ed.2d 202 (1984)).</p>\n<p id=\"b113-9\">In the present ease, this Court finds that appellant has failed to meet his burden of demonstrating a \u201cmanifest probability\u201d that the denial of his motion for a mistrial was prejudicial. First, appellant argues that he was prejudiced because M. B. was more attentive than the other jurors, including the alternate who replaced her. Regarding this argument, the record reveals that when discussing whether M.B. should be dismissed from the jury, appellant\u2019s counsel asserted that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b113-11\">[M.B. has] been one of the more attentive jurors in the whole case. She\u2019s been the one who has been taking a lot of notes ... [a]nd I say that \u2014 I don\u2019t remember which one was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>the alternate. It is one of the guys, I believe and ... he has [not] been anywhere near as attentive as [M.B.] in the case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b114-4\">The record reveals nothing else regarding jurors M.B.\u2019s and M.S.\u2019s attentiveness, or lack thereof.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-5\">In <em>Mayo v. Commonwealth, </em>10 Va.App. 335, 337, 391 S.E.2d 888, 890 (1990), this Court noted that it would not be able to determine whether a juror was actually asleep even though the record revealed that the trial court <em>sua sponte </em>admonished the jury to keep their eyes open, and the Commonwealth\u2019s Attorney later jokingly referred to a man on the jury as the \u201csleeping juror.\u201d Similarly, in the present case, the record reveals one assertion by appellant\u2019s counsel that M.B. was more attentive than the alternate juror. Without more, this Court cannot conclude that M.B. was indeed more attentive than the alternate, let alone that it is manifestly probable that appellant was prejudiced by the trial court\u2019s decision to replace M.B. with the alternate. Moreover, just because a juror appears to be taking copious notes does not necessarily mean that the juror is attentive. <em>See id. </em>(noting that just because a juror\u2019s eyes are closed \u201cdoes not mean that the juror was inattentive\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b114-6\">Next, appellant asserts he was prejudiced because the other jurors \u201ceasily could have inferred\u201d from M.B.\u2019s removal that the trial judge believed that M.B. needed to be protected from retribution by appellant. While the record establishes that the other jurors knew of M.B.\u2019s encounter with the young woman, it provides no support for appellant\u2019s assertion that they were also tainted. Rather, M.B. specifically told the trial court that the other jurors were only \u201cconcern[ed]\u201d for M.B., not that they were concerned individually.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-7\">Without a showing that the other jurors were also tainted by M.B.\u2019s encounter with the woman, appellant is left only with his speculative assertions that the rest of the jury could have been adversely affected. Such assertions are insufficient to demonstrate a manifest probability that appellant has been prejudiced.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>Therefore, this Court finds appellant has failed to meet his burden of demonstrating a \u201cmanifest probability\u201d that he was prejudiced by the trial court\u2019s denial of a motion for a mistrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-5\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b115-6\">For the foregoing reasons, this Court holds that the trial court did not abuse its discretion by removing M.B. from the jury and replacing her with the alternate. Additionally, this Court holds the trial court did not err by denying appellant\u2019s motion for a mistrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b108-8\">. Appellant waived trial by jury on the possession of a firearm by a convicted felon charge. Consequently, a bench trial on that charge was consolidated with a jury trial on the first-degree murder and use of a firearm in the commission of first-degree murder charges.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b110-9\">. Appellant does not challenge that M.S., the alternate who replaced M.B., was \"another qualified juror\u201d as is contemplated by Code \u00a7 8.01-361. Accordingly, this Court's analysis does not address this requirement.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b111-8\">. Citing to <em>Parker v. Commonwealth, </em>14 Va.App. 592, 421 S.E.2d 450 (1992), appellant argues that the trial court erred by removing M.B. for cause after \"final submission of the case.\u201d This argument, however, is procedurally defaulted because appellant failed to make the argument before the trial court. Accordingly, it is barred by Rule 5A:18, which \"requires a litigant to make timely and specific objections, so that the trial court has 'an opportunity to rule intelligently on the issues presented, thus avoiding unnecessary appeals and reversals.'\" <em>Brown v. Commonwealth, </em>279 Va. 210, 217, 688 S.E.2d 185, 189 (2010) (quoting <em>West v. Commonwealth, </em>43 Va.App. 327, 337, 597 S.E.2d 274, 278 (2004)).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
