Prior to trial, Mason moved to suppress the evidence, claiming that the traffic stop was unconstitutional. The trial court disagreed, denied the motion, and convicted Mason of the charged offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-9\">On appeal, Mason challenges the trial court\u2019s denial of his motion to suppress. A divided panel of this Court agreed with Mason, reversed the trial court\u2019s ruling on the motion to suppress, and remanded the matter to the trial court. <em>Mason v. Commonwealth, </em>63 Va.App. 587, 760 S.E.2d 831 (2014). We granted the Commonwealth\u2019s petition for rehearing <em>en banc, </em>vacated the panel opinion, and now affirm the decision of the trial court.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b341-10\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-11\">We restate the facts \u201cin the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, giving it the benefit of any reasonable infer<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>ences.\u201d <em>Glenn v. Commonwealth, </em>49 Va.App. 413, 416, 642 S.E.2d 282, 283 (2007) <em>(en </em>banc) (internal quotation marks omitted), <em>aff'd, </em>275 Va. 123, 654 S.E.2d 910 (2008). \u201cIn doing so, we consider facts presented both at the suppression hearing and at trial.\u201d <em>Elliott v. Commonwealth, </em>61 Va.App. 48, 51, 733 S.E.2d 146, 148 (2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b342-5\">In this case, a police officer testified that, while operating a stationary radar unit, he saw a sedan with a \u201cdangling object\u201d that was \u201changing from the rearview mirror.\u201d App. at 24. The officer testified that he \u201csaw it clearly\u201d as the vehicle \u201cwent by\u201d him at \u201capproximately 2:30 in the afternoon.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 21, 31. The object, reproduced below, was admitted into evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>[[Image here]]</p>\n<p id=\"b343-11\">In his testimony, the officer identified this object as the \u201cdangling object that [he] saw on that particular day.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 24. It is an opaque parking pass measuring five inches long and three inches wide. When asked if the dangling parking pass that he observed \u201ccould obstruct a driver\u2019s view,\u201d the officer replied unequivocally, \u201cIt could, yes, ma\u2019am.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 31. Code \u00a7 46.2-1054 prohibits, among other things, any object from being \u201csuspended from any part of the motor vehicle in such a manner as to obstruct the driver\u2019s clear view of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>highway through the windshield, the front side windows, or the rear window.\u201d Mason conceded in the trial court that the officer made a traffic stop of the sedan believing that \u201che was acting properly\u201d pursuant to Code \u00a7 46.2-1054. <em>Id. </em>at 89.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-5\">At the time of the traffic stop, Mason was a passenger in the sedan. The officer intended to issue the driver a summons for driving without a seatbelt and for violating Code \u00a7 46.2-1054. Prior to issuing the summons, however, the officer asked the driver if he would consent to a \u201cweapons\u201d pat down. <em>Id. </em>at 58. The driver consented, and the officer found marijuana on the driver during the pat down.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-6\">The officer then searched the sedan and found a backpack containing cocaine, ecstasy pills, a \u201clarge sum of individually wrapped bags\u201d of marijuana, <em>id. </em>at 130, a digital scale, and a box of plastic bags. Other evidence established that the backpack belonged to Mason. The officer then arrested Mason for possession of drugs. A search of Mason incident to his arrest yielded $3,381 in cash and a cell phone on his person.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-7\">Prior to trial, Mason sought to suppress all incriminating evidence gathered during the traffic stop on the basis that no officer could reasonably suspect that the parking pass violated Code \u00a7 46.2-1054. At the suppression hearing, the trial judge made various remarks from the bench suggesting his inclination to grant the motion to suppress. After making these remarks, however, the judge \u201casked for additional time to consider\u201d the issue, <em>id. </em>at 101, and issued an order stating that the court needed \u201cmore time to deliberate on the motion to suppress,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 98. The trial judge also took a \u201cview of the scene,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 101, to determine if the parking pass could obstruct a driver\u2019s vision in a sedan similar to the one that the officer had stopped. <em>See </em>Oral Argument Audio at 9:47 to 9:55, 26:04 to 26:30 (Apr. 1, 2014) (stipulation of counsel).</p>\n<p id=\"b344-8\">At a later hearing, the judge advised counsel that he had reconsidered his earlier remarks.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> He said that his initial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>\u201cconcern\u201d was that the parking pass did not <em>\u201csubstantially </em>obstruct\u201d the driver\u2019s view of the highway. App. at 102 (emphasis added). But after reviewing the caselaw \u201cstacked up against [him],\u201d the judge explained, he realized that neither the statute nor the reasonable suspicion standard required a substantial obstruction. <em>Id. </em>at 105. The case law he reviewed included an unpublished opinion from our Court, <em>Commonwealth v. Bryant, </em>No. 0076-04-1, 2004 WL 1313044, at *1, 2004 Va.App. LEXIS 283, at *4 (Va.Ct.App. June 15, 2004), which reversed a suppression order when an officer had stopped a vehicle displaying an \u201cair freshener hanging from the rear view mirror\u201d that \u201ccould\u201d have obstructed the driver\u2019s view in violation of Code \u00a7 46.2-1054. <em>Accord Richardson v. Commonwealth, </em>No. 0946-13-3, 2014 WL 1041799, at *1, 2014 Va.App. LEXIS 98, at *4, *11 (Va.Ct.App. Mar. 18, 2014) (upholding a traffic stop when the officer observed that an air freshener \u201ccould be in violation\u201d of Code \u00a7 46.2-1054); <em>Pegram v. Commonwealth, </em>No. 1041-95-2, 1996 WL 537862, at *1, 1996 Va.App. LEXIS 611, at *2 (Va.Ct.App. Sept. 24, 1996) (validating a traffic stop pursuant to Code \u00a7 46.2-1054 given the officer\u2019s observation of a \u201clarge cloth object\u201d hanging from the rearview mirror).</p>\n<p id=\"b345-5\">Acknowledging that he \u201cinitially disagreed\u201d with the view taken by these unpublished (and thus nonbinding) opinions, the trial judge explained that \u201cwhat carrie[d] the day\u201d was the definition of \u201cobstruction.\u201d App. at 105. \u201c[Ujltimately it\u2019s the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>definition that persuaded the Court that that\u2019s what the law is intended and that\u2019s what the law says.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Repudiating some of his earlier statements, the trial judge held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b346-5\">[T]he Court is of the opinion that the standard for [the officer] to have stopped the vehicle was[:] is there <em>reasonable suspicion </em>that this object is ... cutting off from sight or blocking an unhampered, ... unrestricted <em>view of the highway ? </em>Well, <em>there is reason to believe that it could be, </em>because there is an object dangling. He is entitled constitutionally to investigate further. So the Court believes that the presence of the object is, in fact, sufficient reasonable suspicion to justify a detention of the vehicle.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b346-6\"><em>Id. </em>(emphasis added).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In short, the trial court explained, \u201cHit\u2019s a parking pass, it\u2019s not a driving pass.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 40.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-8\">A. The Reasonable Suspicion Standard</p>\n<p id=\"b346-9\">Reasonable suspicion is simply suspicion that is reasonable. It is not something more than suspicion. And it can hardly be called proof. To be sure, the degree of certitude required by reasonable suspicion is \u201c \u2018considerably less than proof of wrongdoing by a preponderance of the evidence,\u2019 and \u2018obviously less demanding than that for probable cause.\u2019\u201d <em>Perry v. Commonwealth, </em>280 Va. 572, 581, 701 S.E.2d 431, 436 (2010) (quoting <em>United States v. Sokolow, </em>490 U.S. 1, 7, 109 S.Ct. 1581, 1585, 104 L.Ed.2d 1 (1989)); <em>see also Navarette v. California, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, \u2014, 134 S.Ct. 1683, 1687, 188 L.Ed.2d 680 (2014). Consequently, \u201cthe mere possibility of an innocent explanation does not necessarily exclude a reasonable suspicion that the suspect might be violating the law.\u201d <em>Morris </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number><em>v. City of Va. Beach, </em>58 Va.App. 173, 183, 707 S.E.2d 479, 483 (2011) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b347-5\">No one can be arrested on the basis of reasonable suspicion. It serves merely to justify a brief detention to investigate. Because the need for justification is quite low, so too is the justifying legal standard. <em>See </em>4 Wayne R. LaFave, <em>Search &amp; Seizure </em>\u00a7 9.5(b), at 658-59 (5th ed.2012) (noting that reasonable suspicion requires merely \u201cthat there exists at the time of the stop a substantial possibility \u2014 or, indeed, <em>even a \u2018moderate chance\u2019 </em>\u2014 that [unlawful] conduct has occurred, is occurring, or is about to occur\u201d (emphasis added) (footnotes omitted) (quoting <em>Safford Unified Sch. Dist. No. 1 v. Redding, </em>557 U.S. 364, 371, 129 S.Ct. 2633, 2639, 174 L.Ed.2d 354 (2009))).</p>\n<p id=\"b347-6\">In suppression hearings, a police officer usually takes the stand and describes what he saw and, occasionally, why he did what he did. While the first part is highly relevant, the second is not. \u201cExamining the subjective intent of the officer \u2018is fundamentally inconsistent with our Fourth Amendment jurisprudence,\u2019 <em>Kentucky v. King, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, \u2014, 131 S.Ct. 1849, 1859, 179 L.Ed.2d 865 (2011), because \u2018the Fourth Amendment regulates conduct rather than thoughts,\u2019 <em>Ashcroft v. al-Kidd, </em>\u2014 U.S.-,---, 131 S.Ct. 2074, 2080-81, 179 L.Ed.2d 1149 (2011) (noting narrow exceptions).\u201d <em>Washington v. Commonwealth, </em>60 Va.App. 427, 435, 728 S.E.2d 521, 525 (2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b347-11\">For these reasons, settled precedent governing Fourth Amendment cases has \u201crepeatedly rejected a subjective approach.\u201d <em>Fernandez v. California, </em>\u2014 U.S.-,-, 134 S.Ct. 1126, 1134, 188 L.Ed.2d 25 (2014) (internal quotation marks omitted); <em>see also Robinson v. Commonwealth, </em>273 Va. 26, 37, 639 S.E.2d 217, 223 (2007) (holding that the officer\u2019s \u201csubjective motivation is irrelevant\u201d (quoting <em>Brigham City v. Stuart, </em>547 U.S. 398, 404, 126 S.Ct. 1943, 1948, 164 L.Ed.2d 650 (2006))). A police officer\u2019s \u201caction is \u2018reasonable\u2019 under the Fourth Amendment, regardless of the individual officer\u2019s state of mind, \u2018as long as the circumstances, viewed <em>objectively, </em>justify the action.\u2019 \u201d <em>Stuart, </em>547 U.S. at 404, 126 S.Ct. at 1948 (brackets omitted) (quoting <em>Scott v.

Commonwealth, </em>279 Va. 665, 673, 691 S.E.2d 801, 805 (2010) (emphasis added and internal quotation marks omitted); <em>see also Stuart, </em>547 U.S. at 404, 126 S.Ct. at 1948.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b348-7\">Because courts \u201cdo not examine the subjective understanding of the particular officer involved,\u201d <em>Heien v. North Carolina, </em>\u2014 U.S.-,-, 135 S.Ct. 530, 539, 190 L.Ed.2d 475 (2014), it necessarily follows that, when deciding a suppression motion, a court should not limit itself \u201cto what the stopping officer says or to evidence of his subjective rationale,\u201d <em>Raab v. Commonwealth, </em>50 Va.App. 577, 583 n. 2, 652 S.E.2d 144, 148 n. 2 (2007) <em>(en </em>banc) (quoting <em>United States v. Brown, </em>232 F.3d 589, 594 (7th Cir.2000)).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Courts should instead \u201clook to the record as a whole to determine what facts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>were known to the officer and then consider whether a reasonable officer in those circumstances would have been suspicious.\u201d LaFave, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 9.5(a), at 647 n. 22 (quoting <em>United States v. McKie, </em>951 F.2d 399, 402 (D.C.Cir.1991)). Because the reasonable suspicion test \u201cis <em>purely </em>objective,\u201d the reasonable suspicion standard imposes \u201cno requirement that an <em>actual suspicion </em>by the officer be shown.\u201d <em>Id. \u00a7 </em>9.5(a), at 647 (second emphasis added). This approach \u201cis obviously far preferable to a system based on the suppositions of individual officers.\u201d <em>Fox v. Commonwealth, </em>43 Va.App. 446, 450, 598 S.E.2d 770, 772 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b349-5\">We thus reject Mason\u2019s contention that an officer making an investigatory stop must actually articulate, from the witness stand, the articulable facts and then explain, in his personal opinion, why these facts prompted him to be suspicious. Any assertion to the contrary is inconsistent with prior <em>en banc </em>precedent from our Court, <em>Raab, </em>50 Va.App. at 583 n. 2, 652 S.E.2d at 148 n. 2, as well as the uniform view among courts that have addressed this issue.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b349-6\">B. Obstructing a Driver\u2019s \u201cClear View op the Highway\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b349-7\">Code \u00a7 46.2-1054 prohibits, among other things, any object<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> from being \u201csuspended from any part of the motor vehicle in such a manner as to obstruct the driver\u2019s clear view of the highway through the windshield, the front side windows, or the rear window.\u201d Applied to a sedan, this portion of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>statute has three components: (i) something \u201csuspended\u201d (ii) that serves to \u201cobstruct\u201d a \u201cclear view of the highway\u201d (iii) through the windshield, the front side windows, or the rear window. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b350-4\">By statute, a highway includes \u201cthe <em>entire width between the boundary lines </em>of every way or place open to the use of the public for purposes of vehicular travel in the Commonwealth, including the streets and alleys.\u201d Code \u00a7 46.2-100 (emphasis added). A highway is not, as Mason presumes, simply the stretch of pavement immediately in front of a driver\u2019s vehicle. Under Virginia law, a \u201chighway\u201d is not limited \u201cto a hard-surfaced or partly hard-surfaced way or to a dirt and gravel way. It does not confine a highway to the main-travelled portion of the way or to lanes specifically designated for vehicular traffic.\u201d <em>Crouse v. Pugh, </em>188 Va. 156, 164-65, 49 S.E.2d 421, 426 (1948); <em>see also Jessee v. Slate, </em>196 Va. 1074, 1083, 86 S.E.2d 821, 826 (1955).</p>\n<p id=\"b350-5\">Because a \u201chighway\u201d includes the \u201centire width between the boundary lines\u201d of the \u201cway or place\u201d used by vehicular traffic, Code \u00a7 46.2-100, it includes overhead highway signs,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> on-ramps and off-ramps, merge lanes, deceleration lanes, roadways,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> bridges,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> intersections,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> shoulders,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>pedestrian crosswalks,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> and shared-use paths.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Thus, a \u201cclear view of the highway,\u201d as used in Code \u00a7 46.2-1054, no doubt means the pavement itself and everything physically on it. It would make no sense for Code \u00a7 46.2-1054 to prohibit a dangling object from obstructing a driver\u2019s view of the pavement directly in front him but not a vehicle, bicyclist, or pedestrian<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> moving across that same pavement.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-4\">In this case, the police officer testified that he \u201cclearly\u201d observed the parking pass prior to stopping the vehicle. App. at 31. The parking pass is an exhibit. We need no description of it from the officer. We are looking at the very thing that the officer said he clearly saw: an opaque plastic card that is five inches long and three inches wide. And the trial judge had something even better. He took a \u201cview of the scene\u201d to determine if the parking pass could obstruct a driver\u2019s vision in a vehicle similar to the one that the officer had stopped. <em>Id. </em>at 101; <em>see </em>Oral Argument Audio at 9:47 to 9:55, 26:04 to 26:30 (Apr. 1, 2014).</p>\n<p id=\"b351-5\">Given these facts, we agree with the trial court that a reasonable officer could suspect that the opaque, five-by-three-inch parking pass dangling from a rearview mirror might violate Code \u00a7 46.2-1054 and thus warrant an investigatory stop. Several scenarios illustrate why. The bottom of the parking pass would be at or slightly above eye level for a driver of average height. The parking pass could be at an angle that might partially block a driver\u2019s clear view of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>vehicle ahead and to the right of him. If that vehicle put on its left-turn signal, for example, the driver with the parking pass might not see it at all \u2014 particularly when the vehicle is merging into highway traffic from an on-ramp. If a driver simply wanted to make a right turn at an intersection, the parking pass could partially obscure his field of vision. An enhanced risk would exist when the driving occurs at night, and only the taillights of a vehicle ahead and to the right are visible. Consider, too, highway signs that are often placed overhead and on the right shoulder of the highway. A person of any height could have his clear view of highway signs partially obstructed by the parking pass, especially during nighttime driving.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-5\">It bears repeating that an officer need not have proof beyond a reasonable doubt of any of these scenarios before he makes a vehicular stop. Nor does he need to be convinced by a preponderance of the evidence. To be sure, the quantum of confidence need not even rise to the level of probable cause. <em>See Perry, </em>280 Va. at 581, 701 S.E.2d at 436. It is enough that the officer is aware of facts that, viewed objectively, could give rise to a reasonable suspicion that the parking pass may be non-compliant with Code \u00a7 46.2-1054. Settled precedent has \u201cconsistently recognized that reasonable suspicion \u2018need not rule out the possibility of innocent conduct.\u2019 \u201d <em>Navarette, </em>\u2014 U.S. at -, 134 S.Ct. at 1691 (quoting <em>United States v. Arvizu, </em>534 U.S. 266, 277, 122 S.Ct. 744, 753, 151 L.Ed.2d 740 (2002)). In this respect, the law employs a \u201ccommonsense approach,\u201d <em>id. </em>at -, 134 S.Ct. at 1690, that takes into account \u201cthe totality of the circumstances \u2014 the whole picture,\u201d <em>id. </em>at-, 134 S.Ct. at 1687 (quoting <em>United States v. Cortez, </em>449 U.S. 411, 417-18, 101 S.Ct. 690, 695, 66 L.Ed.2d 621 (1981)), and asks simply whether unlawful activity \u201cmay be afoot,\u201d <em>id. </em>at-, 134 S.Ct. at 1690 (quoting <em>Terry v. Ohio, </em>392 U.S. 1, 30, 88 S.Ct. 1868, 1884, 20 L.Ed.2d 889 (1968)).</p>\n<p id=\"b352-14\">Mason does not directly challenge these principles. Instead, underlying much of his argument is the unstated, but implied, assertion that this type of traffic infraction is simply too trifling to warrant an investigatory stop. Underlying <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>Code \u00a7 46.2-1054, however, is the General Assembly\u2019s unstated, but implied, recognition that a driver\u2019s ability to see clearly through an unobstructed windshield is crucial to the safety of the driver as well as others sharing the road. We certainly concur. At some point in every trial judge\u2019s career, he or she has heard a confounded witness, while testifying about a tragic automobile accident, say simply, \u201cI don\u2019t know what happened. I just didn\u2019t see the other car.\u201d Given the multitude of other distractions competing for a driver\u2019s attention, it hardly makes sense for the law to treat as trivial the perfectly reasonable suspicion that a five-by-three inch opaque parking pass, hanging from the rearview mirror of a sedan, could obstruct a driver\u2019s clear view of the highway.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b353-5\">Needless to say, our holding does not endorse any <em>per se </em>rule authorizing traffic stops whenever an object of any kind is observed dangling from a vehicle\u2019s rearview mirror. While the prosecutor asserted as much in the trial court, <em>see id. </em>at 53, the Attorney General correctly disavowed the overstatement on appeal, <em>see </em>Oral Argument Audio at 14:56 to 15:10, 16:22 to 16:57 (Nov. 18, 2014). Code \u00a7 46.2-1054, after all, does not uniformly forbid drivers from dangling objects from their rearview mirrors \u2014 only those positioned \u201cin such a manner as to obstruct the driver\u2019s clear view of the highway.\u201d We thus limit our holding to the suspected obstruction in this case: a five-by-three-inch opaque parking pass hanging from a rearview mirror of a sedan.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>Finally, we acknowledge that the application of the concept of reasonable searches and seizures to Code \u00a7 46.2-1054\u2019s prohibition on dangling obstructions involves an inescapable exercise in judicial line-drawing. But, as Justice Holmes once said, we should not be \u201ctroubled by the question where to draw the line. That is the question in pretty much everything worth arguing in the law.\u201d <em>Irwin v. Gavit, </em>268 U.S. 161, 168, 45 S.Ct. 475, 476, 69 L.Ed. 897 (1925).

Despite the majority\u2019s assertion to the contrary, I believe that the majority opinion in this case will be read to provide \u201cautomatic\u201d reasonable articulable suspicion for any officer to pull a citizen over if he/she observes <em>any </em>object dangling from a rearview mirror. Moreover, henceforth, reasonable suspicion justifying the seizure of citizens will be found even if police officers are mistaken concerning the law as long as their testimony includes magic words such as \u201cI thought ... I believed ... I mistakenly believed ... I suspected ... I mistakenly suspected ...\u201d or as in this case, the officer just doesn\u2019t really know one way or the other.

Reasonable Suspicion and the Fourth Amendment</p>\n<p id=\"b356-5\">Even a cursory review of <em>Terry </em>and the cases which follow it reveal often repeated language requiring specific facts in support of an officer\u2019s suspicion that criminal activity is afoot. \u201c[T]he police can stop and briefly detain a person for investigative purposes if the officer has a reasonable suspicion supported by articulable facts that criminal activity \u2018may be afoot,\u2019 even if the officer lacks probable cause.\u201d <em>United States v. Sokolow, </em>490 U.S. 1, 7, 109 S.Ct. 1581, 1585, 104 L.Ed.2d 1 (1989). \u201c[I]n justifying the particular intrusion the police officer must be able to point to specific and articulable facts which, taken together with rational inferences from those facts, reasonably warrant that intrusion.\u201d <em>Terry, </em>392 U.S. at 21, 88 S.Ct. at 1880. \u201cA court sitting to determine the existence of reasonable suspicion must require the agent to articulate the factors leading to that conclusion.\u201d <em>Sokolow, </em>490 U.S. at 10, 109 S.Ct. at 1587.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-7\">\u201cTo establish reasonable suspicion, an officer must be able to articulate more than an unparticularized suspicion or \u2018hunch\u2019 that criminal activity is afoot.\u201d <em>Rudolph v. Commonwealth, </em>277 Va. 209, 210, 722 S.E.2d 527, 528 (2009). \u201cThis demand for specificity in the information upon which police action is predicated is the central teaching of [the United States Supreme Court\u2019s] Fourth Amendment jurisprudence.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number><em>Terry, </em>392 U.S. at 21 n. 18, 88 S.Ct. at 1880 n. 18.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> It is axiomatic that whether or not reasonable suspicion of criminal activity exists must be determined from <em>\u201cthe facts available to the officer at the moment of the seizure.\u201d Id. </em>at 21-22, 88 S.Ct. at 1880 (emphasis added).

Jurisprudence from various federal circuits supports this proposition. <em>See e.g., United States v. Branch, </em>537 F.3d 328, 336 (4th Cir.2008) (\u201cIf a police officer wants to detain a driver beyond the scope of a routine traffic stop ... he must possess a justification for doing so other than the initial traffic violation that prompted the stop in the first place.\u201d (citation omitted));<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number><em>Croom v.

First, Officer Richards\u2019s failure to investigate the existence of the alleged \u201ccriminal activity\u201d is fatal to any justification of Mason\u2019s seizure under <em>Terry </em>and its progeny. Second, the testimony of Officer Richards articulated absolutely no facts from which reasonable suspicion of criminal activity can be inferred, and the parking pass, in its capacity as an exhibit, does nothing to overcome that failure.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-5\">Officer Richards made no effort whatsoever to investigate the \u201ccriminal activity\u201d he asserted to be the basis for the stop. Instead, Officer Richards testified that the only reason he stopped the vehicle was because he observed \u201ca dangling object.\u201d<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> Yet, Officer Richards testified that, after stopping the vehicle, he never sat in the driver\u2019s seat or otherwise made any attempt to determine if a driver could see the roadway through the windshield given the \u201cdangling object\u2019s\u201d size and location behind the rearview mirror. At no point was Officer Richards able to articulate any facts that, even when coupled <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>with an examination of the pass itself and other evidence in the record, would lead to any objective belief that the \u201cdangling object\u201d was suspended \u201cin such a manner as to obstruct the driver\u2019s clear view of the highway\u201d as prohibited by Code \u00a7 46.2-1054.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b359-5\">Despite the deficiencies in Officer Richards\u2019s testimony, the majority asserts that his testimony supplied evidence of \u201ccriminal activity\u201d when, after being handed the parking pass as an exhibit in the trial, he noted in response to the prosecutor\u2019s abstract question that because of its opaque nature, the 3\" x 5\" parking pass \u201ccould [obstruct a driver\u2019s view].\u201d<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> Alternatively, the majority reasons that the parking pass itself supplies the missing articulated evidence of \u201ccriminal activity\u201d despite factual findings by the trial court to the contrary. These conclusions are inapposite to <em>Terry </em>and its progeny.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-6\">As to the former position advanced by the majority, the record is clear that neither Officer Richards\u2019s answer to the prosecutor\u2019s abstract question, nor the context supplied by the question itself established any facts or reasonable inferences that the parking pass and its placement in the vehicle blocked any view of the highway. If either the answer or the context of the question had done so, the record then would at least have provided the missing evidence of criminality that the majority creates out of whole cloth. In this case, Officer Richards articulated only facts that supported entirely lawful conduct and failed to provide any reason to suspect that criminal activity was occurring or about to occur. Insofar as evidence of \u201ccriminal activity\u201d provided by the parking pass <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>itself is concerned, I believe that the unequivocal and reiterated factual findings by the trial court which consistently and repeatedly stated that the parking pass, as placed in the vehicle, would <em>not </em>obstruct the driver\u2019s view of the highway renders this portion of the majority\u2019s analysis untenable.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-4\">The majority insists that the trial court\u2019s statement, \u201cbecause there is an object dangling ... [the officer] is entitled constitutionally to investigate further\u201d was the actual factual finding by the trial court rather than simply its legal conclusion. In my view, the context of the trial court\u2019s words could hardly be clearer that this statement was actually an erroneous legal holding based upon the Commonwealth\u2019s equally erroneous argument that the mere fact that any object was suspended from the rearview mirror, was <em>per se </em>sufficient reasonable suspicion of criminal activity to justify the seizure of the vehicle and its occupants.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-5\">The majority generally dismisses all of the trial court\u2019s statements regarding the parking pass as \u201cthe judge\u2019s off-the-cuff remarks from the bench.\u201d However, immediately following Officer Richards\u2019s testimony, and in response to the prosecutor\u2019s argument that reasonable suspicion exists to stop the car because there is an object hanging from the mirror that \u201cdoes obstruct and you can\u2019t see through it,\u201d the trial court responded,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b360-6\">I will say this to you Ms. Pleas [prosecutor], I think you can hang this [parking pass] on any car in America, and it won\u2019t obstruct the view at all. It hangs up on the rearview mirror, which is up here. That doesn\u2019t obstruct your view. You don\u2019t even see the highway up there. The highway is out here. It doesn\u2019t obstruct your view at all. But that\u2019s not even the question. Now \u2014 but that\u2019s not even the question \u2014 the question in the case is whether there is reasonable suspicion that the object could obstruct the view. Because it doesn\u2019t \u2014 I\u2019m trying whether the officer could believe it. And I think it\u2019s not an obvious answer to that.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b360-7\">J.A. at 34-35. Contrary to the assertion of the majority, the trial court\u2019s subsequent erroneous legal holding does not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>nullify or \u201csupersede\u201d its factual findings that the parking pass would not obstruct the view of the driver \u201con any car in America.\u201d Such a conclusion would fly in the face of well-settled law in Virginia that mandates this Court evaluate a trial court\u2019s fact-finding through a wholly distinct lens than a trial court\u2019s conclusions of law. Indeed, in a Fourth Amendment case, this Court must evaluate both the factual findings and conclusions of law of the trial court. In such a scenario, this Court gives \u201cdeference to the factual findings of the trial court\u201d and \u201cindependently determined\u201d whether those findings satisfy the requirements of the Fourth Amendment. <em>Whitfield v. Commonwealth, </em>265 Va. 358, 361, 576 S.E.2d 463, 464 (2003). \u201cThere is good reason for the rule that appellate courts must defer to the factual findings of the trial judge in Fourth Amendment cases. The fact patterns in such cases arrive in infinite variety, seldom or never exactly duplicated.\u201d <em>Malbrough v. Commonwealth, </em>275 Va. 163, 171, 655 S.E.2d 1, 5 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b361-5\">The factual statements of the trial court regarding the parking pass support only the legal position advanced by the Commonwealth and ultimately adopted by the trial court, that <em>all </em>objects suspended from a rearview mirror <em>per se </em>provide reasonable suspicion to detain a vehicle\u2019s occupants. The majority overcomes this logical deficiency by recasting the trial court\u2019s legal conclusion that \u201can object dangling ... [entitles the officer] constitutionally to investigate further\u201d as a factual finding that the pass obstructs a driver\u2019s view of the highway. However, such recasting is outside the proper role of an appellate court. <em>See Thomas v. Commonwealth, </em>48 Va.App. 605, 608, 633 S.E.2d 229, 231 (2006) (\u201cWe review the factfinding of a lower court \u2018with the highest degree of appellate deference.\u2019 \u201d); <em>see also Commonwealth v. Hilliard, </em>270 Va. 42, 49-50, 613 S.E.2d 579, 584 (2005) (An appellate court reviews the trial court\u2019s \u201cfindings of historical fact only for clear error and must give deference to the inferences that may be drawn from those factual findings.\u201d). As such, this Court is bound by the repeated factual findings of the trial court that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>the parking pass did not, and would not obstruct the view on \u201cany car in America.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b362-4\">II. The Officer\u2019s Mistake of Law</p>\n<p id=\"b362-5\">Officer Richards\u2019s failure to investigate the criminal activity suspected here is also fatal to a Fourth Amendment analysis.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> Investigation of the suspected criminal activity is the only rationale for a detention under <em>Terry. </em>It is axiomatic that if an officer takes no action to confirm or dispel the suspicion of criminal activity, the detention is unwarranted. Moreover, while pretextual stops are permissible under the Supreme Court\u2019s holding in <em>Whren v. United States, </em>517 U.S. 806, 116 S.Ct. 1769, 135 L.Ed.2d 89 (1996), that is only so if probable cause exists that an offense has been committed. Thus, even though the offense for which probable cause exists is a pretext for the real reason for the detention, the existence of probable cause for <em>any </em>offense, satisfies the Fourth Amendment. Here, there is no suggestion of probable cause for any offense whatsoever and therefore any detention that does not serve the limited purpose of a <em>Terry </em>stop, is necessarily unconstitutional.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b362-6\">It is also obvious to me, as it was to the trial court, that Officer Richards never investigated the \u201ccriminal activity\u201d he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>asserted was afoot because he mistakenly believed that <em>any </em>object suspended from the interior of a vehicle violated the law. The trial court asked counsel \u201cIs it of any probative value that the officer never inquired as to whether \u2014 never even looked to see whether the object, in fact obstructed the highway?\u201d J.A. at 47. The trial court then noted, \u201cListening to [Officer Richards] answering the questions, this was a stop because of the existence of a dangling object. That\u2019s what the officer did. And he \u2014 and I\u2019m not claiming bad faith. It may be a misapprehension of the law.\u201d J.A. at 51. \u201c[Officer Richards] didn\u2019t have any idea that this [object] needed to be an obstruction.\u201d J.A. at 52.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-5\">Significantly, the trial court then asked the prosecutor, \u201cIs it the Commonwealth\u2019s position that <em>any </em>object that dangles gives rise to the stop of the vehicle?\u201d The prosecutor responded in the affirmative, and the trial court noted <em>\u201cI </em>think you\u2019ve got to get there. I think that\u2019s what you\u2019ve got to argue.\u201d \u201c[S]o the issue becomes, and where the Court has put its focus, is whether or not essentially <em>the mere fact of a dangling object gives the officer reasonable suspicion </em>to stop to determine whether or not the object, and I quote the statute <em>\u2018obstructs the driver\u2019s clear view of the highway.\u2019 \u201d </em>J.A. at 102 (emphasis added). The trial court ultimately and, in my view, erroneously, adopted the Commonwealth\u2019s argument as its holding, relying upon two circuit court opinions and an unpublished opinion of this Court and never considered the officer\u2019s failure to actually investigate the statutory violation as a factor in its analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-6\">The Commonwealth previously maintained on brief and at oral argument before the panel, the position it took at trial and that the trial court adopted, that \u201cdangling objects\u201d <em>per se </em>\u201cprovide reasonable suspicion to stop any vehicle.\u201d The Commonwealth retreated from this position to the \u201cknow it when you see it\u201d reasonable suspicion standard for the first time in oral argument before this Court sitting <em>en banc, </em>implying without overtly arguing that the trial court now was right but for the wrong reason. The majority now adopts this standard. In my view, the Commonwealth is incorrect in both its original <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>and revisionist positions on the application of the law. Moreover, without any guidance or any limitations to lower courts or police officers, the majority\u2019s analysis amounts to choosing the latter option of overreaching hindsight in the Hobson\u2019s Choice of either agreeing with the trial court and the Commonwealth\u2019s original position that it is objectively reasonable to stop <em>all </em>motor vehicles with <em>any </em>object hanging from the mirror regardless of any possible obstruction of the view of the highway, and the alternative \u201cwe will know it when we see it\u201d standard advanced today pursuant to <em>de novo </em>fact-finding by this Court regarding the object in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-5\">To be clear, a traffic stop will be deemed a reasonable \u201cseizure\u201d when an objective review of the facts shows that an officer possessed specific, articulable facts that an individual was violating a traffic law at the time of the stop. An officer need not be factually accurate in his belief that a violation has occurred, but, instead, need only produce facts establishing that he <em>reasonably </em>believed a violation had taken place. <em>Illinois v. Rodriguez, </em>497 U.S. 177, 185-86, 110 S.Ct. 2793, 2799-800, 111 L.Ed.2d 148 (1990) (emphasis added). In order to satisfy the reasonableness requirement of the Fourth Amendment, what is necessary of \u201cthe police officer conducting a search or seizure under one of the exceptions to the warrant requirement ... is not that they always be correct, but that they always be reasonable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 185, 110 S.Ct. at 2800. However, reasonableness will not normally be found in mistakes of law by a police officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-6\">The United States Supreme Court recently held that only <em>objectively reasonable </em>mistakes of law are acceptable excuses from strict compliance with the Fourth Amendment. Significantly, for the purposes of the analysis here, the Supreme Court rejected the proposition that a good faith mistake of law was <em>per se </em>unreasonable under the Fourth Amendment, but Chief Justice Roberts clarified that \u201c[t]he limit is that the mistakes must be those of reasonable men.\u201d <em>Heien v. North Carolina, </em>\u2014 U.S.-,-, 135 S.Ct. 530, 536, 190 L.Ed.2d 475 (2014). \u201cAn officer can gain no Fourth Amendment advantage through a sloppy study of the laws he is duty-bound <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>to enforce.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at-, 135 S.Ct. at 539-40. The statute in question in <em>Heien </em>contained confusing language, making it unclear whether only one working \u201cstop lamp\u201d (brake light) was required by law, especially considering another statute seemed to suggest that vehicles must have \u201call originally equipped rear lamps or the equivalent in good working order.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at-, 135 S.Ct. at 540.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-6\">Unlike the statute in <em>Heien </em>that involved a difficult issue of statutory interpretation well outside the ken of non-lawyer police officers, the statute at issue in this case suffers from no such infirmity. No objectively reasonable officer could sensibly conclude from a reading of Code \u00a7 46.2-1054 that an object simply hanging from the rearview mirror is unlawful, unless it also obstructs the driver\u2019s clear view of the highway. Indeed, it is evident from the totality of Officer Richards\u2019s testimony that the trial court was correct in observing that Officer Richards mistakenly believed that <em>any </em>object suspended from the interior of a vehicle constituted a Class 4 misdemeanor pursuant to Code \u00a7 46.2-1054, as opposed to only those objects which are suspended \u201cin such a manner as to obstruct the driver\u2019s clear view of the highway.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b365-7\">The alleged traffic infraction (merely having a parking pass suspended from the rearview mirror) that formed the basis of the stop, was at best the sort of \u201csloppy study\u201d of Code \u00a7 46.2-1054 referred to by Chief Justice Roberts in <em>Heien. </em>To hold otherwise ignores the observation by both the majority and dissent in <em>Heien </em>that it would be a <em>rare </em>situation where the law is so confusing that it would be reasonable for a police officer to be unaware of it. Further, such a holding would also mean that ignorance of the plain language used in the law, as opposed to any nuanced interpretation of it, is an automatic excuse for police officers, although certainly not for those they arrest. Since Officer Richards was unable to testify to any facts, objectively viewed, that would support reasonable suspicion that the parking pass violated Virginia law, application of the Supreme Court\u2019s holding in <em>Heien </em>compels a conclusion that Officer Richards\u2019s objectively unreasonable mistake of law was insufficient to justify a stop under the Fourth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>Moreover, several other states with similar statutes to Code \u00a7 46.2-1054 have also held that the mere presence of dangling objects from the rearview mirror, without facts supporting an objective officer\u2019s reasonable suspicion that the object was obstructing the driver\u2019s view of the highway, violates the Fourth Amendment. <em>See e.g. People v. Arias, </em>159 P.3d 134, 138-39 (Colo.2007) (holding that a motor vehicle stop was unjustified because the officer who erroneously thought that an air freshener hanging from a rearview mirror, regardless of whether it \u201cobstructed\u201d the \u201cdriver\u2019s vision through any required glass equipment,\u201d was a violation of Colorado law had not testified to any facts to support an objective finding that the air freshener obstructed driver\u2019s view); <em>People v. Cole, </em>369 Ill.App.3d 960, 314 Ill.Dec. 171, 874 N.E.2d 81, 87-88 (finding that a motor vehicle stop was unjustified because the officer did not realize the statute required the suspended object to \u201cmaterially obstruct\u201d the driver\u2019s view and that despite the officer\u2019s mistaken interpretation of the law, was unable to articulate facts that a reasonable officer would have found to support reasonable suspicion that the defendant, who had beads hanging from his rearview mirror, was violating the law as written), <em>cert. denied, </em>223 Ill.2d 644, 310 Ill.Dec. 251, 865 N.E.2d 971 (2007); and <em>State v. Cyrus, </em>297 Conn. 829, 1 A.3d 59, 68 (2010) (holding that an officer\u2019s mistaken belief that any object hanging from the rearview mirror violated Connecticut law could not support a finding of reasonable suspicion because the officer\u2019s testimony offered no facts or any objective basis to conclude he suspected that the chain and cross hanging from the defendant\u2019s rearview mirror obstructed the driver\u2019s view or that such a belief would have been objectively reasonable).</p>\n<p id=\"b366-5\">The majority asserts that \u201cour holding does not endorse any <em>per se </em>rule authorizing traffic stops whenever an object of any kind is observed dangling <em>from </em>a vehicle\u2019s rearview mirror.\u201d Yet, its analysis, failing as it does to provide any substantive guidance to police and trial courts, has the consequence of implying just the opposite \u2014 that it is nevertheless reasonable to stop <em>any </em>vehicle, <em>any </em>time, if it has <em>any </em>object suspended <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>from the mirror or windshield. It does not matter that the object may be a parking pass, graduation tassel, GPS receiver, government issued toll transponder, or any other object no matter the size. All such vehicles may now be stopped and the occupants detained in the sure and certain knowledge that today\u2019s precedent will justify their stop despite any testimonial deficiency in the articulation of facts establishing reasonable suspicion of criminal activity, any failure to conduct an investigation into the suspected criminal activity, and even ignorance of the plain language of the statute in question by those supposed to enforce it.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-4\">III. The Exclusionary Rule</p>\n<p id=\"b367-5\">Although, for the reasons stated, I would hold that Mason\u2019s Fourth Amendment rights were violated when the vehicle in which he was a passenger was stopped, I cannot say based upon the record before us that the exclusionary rule requires the suppression of the evidence in this case. <em>See Hudson v. Michigan, </em>547 U.S. 586, 592, 126 S.Ct. 2159, 2164, 165 L.Ed.2d 56 (2006) (noting that the exclusionary rule does not apply to \u201c \u2018every item of evidence that has a causal connection with police misconduct\u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>Segura v. United States, </em>468 U.S. 796, 829, 104 S.Ct. 3380, 3398, 82 L.Ed.2d 599 (1984) (Stevens, J., dissenting))). Mason had no apparent standing to object to the seizure or search of the driver, and the trial court, having denied the motion to suppress, made no determination as to whether the driver\u2019s consent to search his person, which led to the search of the car and the discovery of evidence against Mason, attenuated any illegality of the stop as it pertained to and affected Mason. <em>See Schneckloth v. Bustamonte, </em>412 U.S. 218, 248-49, 93 S.Ct. 2041, 2058-59, 36 L.Ed.2d 854 (1973) (holding that whether an individual\u2019s consent to a search was voluntary is a factual question); <em>United States v. Seidman, </em>156 F.3d 542, 548 (4th Cir.1998) (concluding that after the trial court determined that the officer entered Seidman\u2019s residence in violation of the Fourth Amendment and that Seidman voluntarily consented to the conversation with the officer, the trial court should have gone further and determined \u201cwhether <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>the taint arising from the unlawful entry was sufficiently attenuated by the consent\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b368-5\">IV. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b368-6\">Concluding as I do that the trial court erred in its holding that reasonable suspicion existed to justify the seizure of the vehicle and its occupants under the Fourth Amendment, I would reverse and remand for a new trial including a determination by the trial court regarding the applicability of the exclusionary rule if the Commonwealth is so advised.</p>\n<footnote label=\"22\">\n<p id=\"b355-14\">. <em>Robbins v.
