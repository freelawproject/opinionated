Taylor was convicted of battery pursuant to Code \u00a7 18.2-57. On appeal, she argues (1) the trial court erred in denying her motion to strike and in failing to grant her motion to set aside the verdict as to the sufficiency of the evidence regarding the battery charge because the conduct did not exceed the bounds of lawful parental discipline; and (2) the trial court erred in denying her motion to set aside the verdict because the misdemeanor was not timely prosecuted under Code \u00a7 19.2-8.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> For the reasons stated below, we reverse the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-7\">I. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b330-8\">\u201cOn appeal, \u2018we review the evidence in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, granting to it all reasonable inferences fairly deducible therefrom.\u2019 \u201d <em>Archer v. Commonwealth, </em>26 Va.App. 1, 11, 492 S.E.2d 826, 881 (1997) (quoting <em>Martin v. Commonwealth, </em>4 Va.App. 438, 443, 358 S.E.2d 415, 418 (1987)).</p>\n<p id=\"b330-9\">So viewed, the record establishes that on April 15, 2013, a grand jury indicted Taylor for felony child endangerment in violation of Code \u00a7 40.1-103. The indictment alleged that the offense occurred between January 1, 2011 and February 23, 2012. On September 25, 2013, a bench trial was held on the charge. Taylor made a motion to strike at the conclusion of the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence. She renewed her motion to strike at the conclusion of the defense\u2019s case. The trial court overruled the motion to strike. At the conclusion of the trial, the court withheld judgment and continued the case until September 30, 2013 for the purpose of reviewing relevant precedent on the matters before it.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>On September 30, 2013, the trial court held that the evidence was insufficient to convict Taylor of the charged crime of child endangerment; however, it held that the evidence was sufficient to convict Taylor of the misdemeanor offense of battery under Code \u00a7 18.2-57, which it concluded was a lesser-included offense of child endangerment. No warrant, bench or otherwise, was issued against Taylor on that misdemeanor charge. Taylor then made a motion to set aside the verdict, objecting to the sufficiency of the evidence and the trial court\u2019s ruling that battery is a lesser-included offense of Code \u00a7 40.1-103.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Taylor also alleged that even if battery is a lesser-included offense of child endangerment, prosecution of that misdemeanor was commenced more than one year from the date of the offense and thus was barred by the statute of limitations. The trial court denied the motion, found Taylor guilty of battery, and sentenced her to eight months of incarceration. Taylor appeals that conviction here.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-5\">II. Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b331-6\">Taylor argues that the trial court erred in denying her motion to set aside the verdict because the misdemeanor was not timely prosecuted pursuant to Code \u00a7 19.2-8. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-7\">\u2018Whether a claim is barred by the statute of limitations is a question of law. This Court \u2018review[s] questions of law <em>de novo.\u201d\u2019 Tuck v. Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Co., </em>47 Va.App. 276, 284, 623 S.E.2d 433, 437 (2005) (quoting <em>Tomes v. James City Fire, </em>39 Va.App. 424, 430, 573 S.E.2d 312, 315 (2002) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted)). Furthermore, when reviewing the statutory language, \u201cwe must give effect to the legislature\u2019s intention as expressed by the language used unless a literal interpretation of the language would result in a manifest absurdity.\u201d <em>Conyers v. Martial Arts World, </em>273 Va. 96, 104, 639 S.E.2d 174, 178 (2007). \u201cIf a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>statute is subject to more than one interpretation, we must apply the interpretation that will carry out the legislative intent behind the statute.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b332-4\">Code \u00a7 19.2-8 states, \u201cA prosecution for a misdemeanor ... shall be commenced within one year next after there was cause therefor.... \u201d We have previously held that \u201c[t]he issuance of a warrant commences a prosecution within the meaning of this provision.\u201d <em>Hall v. Commonwealth, </em>2 Va.App. 159, 162, 342 S.E.2d 640, 641 (1986) (citing <em>Ange v. Commonwealth, </em>217 Va. 861, 862, 234 S.E.2d 64, 65 (1977)); <em>cf. Phillips v. Commonwealth, </em>257 Va. 548, 553, 514 S.E.2d 340, 343 (1999) (noting that a prosecution \u201cis the process in which an accused is brought to justice from the time a formal accusation is made through trial and final judgment in a court of appropriate jurisdiction\u201d). This case, however, presents an issue not yet considered by the courts of the Commonwealth of Virginia: whether one can be convicted of a lesser offense upon a prosecution for a greater crime, which includes the lesser offense, commenced after the limitations period has run on the lesser offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-5\">In <em>Hall, </em>we held that the Commonwealth\u2019s prosecution of the defendant for a lesser-included misdemeanor was not barred by the statute of limitations because the warrant and subsequent indictment charging the defendant with a greater felony was commenced within the statute of limitations for the misdemeanor. <em>Hall, 2 </em>Va.App. at 162-63, 342 S.E.2d at 641-42. In dicta, we left open the resolution of the issue presented in this case, noting in a footnote that \u201cmost authorities agree that the commencement of a felony prosecution <em>after </em>the running of the limitation period for a necessarily included misdemeanor offense would result in a bar to a conviction for the necessarily included lesser offense.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 162 n. 2, 342 S.E.2d at 641 n. 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-6\">Although we have not had an occasion to consider this issue, the overwhelming majority of American courts that have addressed it have concluded that one cannot be convicted of a lesser-included offense upon a prosecution for the greater <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>crime when the prosecution is commenced after the limitations period has run on the lesser offense. <em>See Waters v. United States, </em>328 F.2d 739 (10th Cir.1964); <em>Askins v. United States, </em>251 F.2d 909 (D.C.Cir.1958); <em>Spears v. State, </em>26 Ala.App. 376, 160 So. 727 (1935); <em>Padie v. State, </em>557 P.2d 1138 (Alaska 1976); <em>Drott v. People, </em>71 Colo. 383, 206 P. 797 (1922); <em>Cane v. State, </em>560 A.2d 1063 (Del.1989); <em>Nelson v. State, </em>17 Fla. 195 (1879); <em>State v. Brossette, </em>163 La. 1035, 113 So. 366 (1927); <em>People v. Burt, </em>51 Mich. 199, 16 N.W. 378 (1883); <em>Riggs v.

Stillwell, </em>175 N.J.Super. 244, 418 A.2d 267 (Ct.App.Div.1980); <em>People v. Di Pasquale, </em>161 A.D. 196, 146 N.Y.S. 523 (1914); <em>State v. Price, </em>1998 WL 896358, 1998 Ohio App. LEXIS 6266 (Ohio Ct.App.1998); <em>Osborn v. State, </em>86 Okla. Crim. 259, 194 P.2d 176 (1948) (recognizing without explicitly affirming the general rule); <em>Hickey v. State, </em>131 Tenn. 112, 174 S.W. 269 (1915) (recognizing rule, which stemmed from Tennessee statute almost identical to Code \u00a7 19.2-8); <em>Fuecher v. State, </em>33 Tex.Crim. 22, 24 S.W. 292 (1893); <em>State v. King, </em>140 W.Va. 362, 84 S.E.2d 313 (1954). In fact, Georgia appears to be the only state that permits such a conviction without a statute expressly allowing it. <em>See Manning v. State, </em>123 Ga.App. 844, 182 S.E.2d 690, 691 (1971).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b333-5\">Recognizing the overwhelming authority supporting Taylor\u2019s argument, the Commonwealth argues that a misdemeanor prosecution was never \u201ccommenced\u201d against Taylor within the meaning of Code \u00a7 19.2-8. Therefore, it reasons, Code \u00a7 19.2-8 does not apply. Furthermore, the Commonwealth argues that Code \u00a7 19.2-8 is <em>in pari materia </em>with Code \u00a7 19.2-285, and thus, they should be construed together. According to the Commonwealth, Code \u00a7 19.2-285 expressly permits a fact-finder to convict a defendant of a lesser-included part of the larger offense. That statute does not reference any time limitation. Code \u00a7 19.2-285 provides,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b334-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>If a person indicted of a felony be by the jury acquitted of part of the offense charged, he shall be sentenced for such part as he is so convicted of, if the same be substantially charged in the indictment, whether it be felony or misdemeanor. If the verdict be set aside and a new trial granted the accused, he shall not be tried for any higher offense than that of which he was convicted on the last trial.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b334-5\">Therefore, the Commonwealth asserts, because there was no \u201ccommencement\u201d of a prosecution under Code \u00a7 19.2-8, the court was required by Code \u00a7 19.2-285 to sentence Taylor for misdemeanor battery without regard to the statute of limitations. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-6\">West Virginia, which shares our statutory scheme, provides particularly helpful guidance in addressing this argument. In <em>State v. King, </em>the Supreme Court of Appeals of West Virginia adopted the majority rule, construing statutes nearly identical to our Code \u00a7\u00a7 19.2-8 and 19.2-285.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>See King, </em>140 W.Va. at 363-72, 84 S.E.2d at 314-18. In that case, King was indicted by a grand jury for malicious assault, a felony, in October 1953. <em>Id. </em>at 364, 84 S.E.2d at 314. The indictment alleged that the crime occurred in October 1951. <em>Id. </em>at 371-72, 84 S.E.2d at 318. At the conclusion of the trial, the jury found King guilty of assault and battery, a misdemeanor, and he was sentenced accordingly. <em>Id. </em>at 364, 84 S.E.2d at 314. King appealed his conviction, alleging that a conviction for the lesser-included misdemeanor was barred by the statute of limitations under W. Va.Code \u00a7 61-11-9. <em>Id. </em>The Supreme Court of Appeals of West Virginia reversed the judgment against King, holding that his conviction for assault and battery was barred by the statute of limitations. <em>Id. </em>at 371-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>72, 84 S.E.2d at 318. In doing so, West Virginia adopted the general rule that \u201c \u2018one indicted for an offense not barred by limitation, but convicted of a lesser included offense which is so barred, is entitled to discharge.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 369, 84 S.E.2d at 317 (quoting 22 C.J.S. <em>Criminal Law </em>\u00a7 225(b) (1989)).</p>\n<p id=\"b335-5\">In <em>King, </em>the attorney general made essentially the same argument asserted by the Commonwealth here: that W. Va. Code \u00a7 62-3-14, West Virginia\u2019s equivalent of our Code \u00a7 19.2-285, read in conjunction with the misdemeanor statute of limitations, \u201crender[ed] [that] case ... a prosecution for a felony,\u201d taking <em>King </em>outside the scope of the general rule quoted above. <em>Id. </em>The court reasoned, however, that W. Va.Code \u00a7 62-3-14 \u201csimply provides a rule for criminal pleading.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 369, 84 S.E.2d at 317. The court noted that W. Va.Code \u00a7 62-3-14 merely provides that the accused in a trial on an indictment that charges a felony and a misdemeanor may be found not guilty of the felony, but guilty of a misdemeanor that is an inherent part of the felony charged. <em>Id. </em>The court observed that if King had been initially indicted for assault and battery, a misdemeanor, a conviction for that crime would have been barred by the statute of limitations. <em>Id. </em>at 371-72, 84 S.E.2d at 318. Thus, it \u201cnecessarily follow[ed]\u201d that his conviction for assault and battery was still barred by the statute of limitations, even though he was indicted for a felony that included the misdemeanor. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b335-6\">The arguments of the parties in this case are almost identical to those in <em>King. </em>Here, like the attorney general in <em>King, </em>the Commonwealth argues that this case did not involve the \u201ccommencement\u201d of a misdemeanor prosecution, making Code \u00a7 19.2-8 inapplicable; therefore, Code \u00a7 19.2-285 controls, allowing the misdemeanor conviction to stand.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-7\">As in <em>King, </em>had Taylor been indicted for a misdemean- or at the time she was actually charged with a felony, a conviction for the misdemeanor would have been barred by the statute of limitations.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Here, \u201ccause\u201d for prosecution arose sometime between January 1, 2011 and February 23, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>2012. Prosecution was commenced, with respect to the felony child endangerment charge and, accordingly, the lesser-included battery charge, when a grand jury indicted Taylor on April 15, 2013, approximately a year and two months after the last date in which the crime could have occurred, February 23, 2012. Simply put, it would negate the purpose and meaning of the statute of limitations to allow the Commonwealth to charge a defendant with a felony \u2014 after the limitations period on a lesser-included misdemeanor had run \u2014 just to obtain a conviction on the otherwise time-barred, lesser-included misdemeanor when the evidence proves insufficient to convict for the greater felony.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-5\">We are unpersuaded by the Commonwealth\u2019s argument that Code \u00a7 19.2-285 rendered this case a prosecution of a felony. The fact that no warrant was issued against Taylor on the misdemeanor does not render Code \u00a7 19.2-8 inapplicable. If battery were not \u201csubstantially charged in the indictment\u201d for felony child endangerment, Taylor could not have been convicted of that offense under the felony indictment. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 19.2-285. In <em>King, </em>for example, King was indicted for felony malicious assault, but, at the conclusion of the trial, the court instructed the jury on only misdemeanor assault and battery. This sequence did not lead the Supreme Court of Appeals of West Virginia to find the misdemeanor limitation period inapplicable. King was still \u201cprosecuted\u201d under the statute for the misdemeanor because he was indicted, and the prosecution presented evidence, on a greater felony that necessarily included the misdemeanor.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-6\">Therefore, consistent with the majority rule, we hold that one cannot be convicted of a lesser offense upon a prosecution for a greater crime, which includes the lesser offense, commenced after the statute of limitations has run on the lesser offense.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> As the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>recognized, \u201c \u2018Statutes of Limitation in criminal cases differ from such statutes in civil cases, in that in civil cases they are statutes of repose, while in criminal cases they create a bar to the prosecution.\u2019 \u201d <em>Benes v. United States, </em>276 F.2d 99, 108-09 (6th Cir.1960) (quoting 1 Wharton, <em>Criminal Procedure </em>\u00a7 367, at 415 (10th ed.)).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Thus, because prosecution was commenced more than one year from the date of the offense, the misdemeanor conviction under Code \u00a7 18.2-57 must be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-5\">III. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b337-6\">For the foregoing reasons, we reverse the ruling of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-7\">\n<em>Reversed and dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b330-10\">. Because we hold that prosecution of the misdemeanor battery charge was not timely commenced, and therefore dismiss the charge for that reason, we need not address Taylor\u2019s first assignment of error regarding the sufficiency of the evidence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b331-8\">. We note that although Taylor contemporaneously objected to the trial court\u2019s finding that battery is a lesser-included offense of child endangerment, she did not assign error to that finding here. Thus, we will assume without deciding that misdemeanor battery is a lesser-included offense of felony child endangerment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b333-6\">. By statute, Maine allows conviction for a time-barred, lesser-included offense. <em>See State </em>v. <em>Borucki, </em>505 A.2d 89, 91 n. 2 (Me.1986).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b334-7\">.
