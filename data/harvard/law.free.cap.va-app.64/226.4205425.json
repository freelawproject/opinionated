Susan L. French, a neighbor of the permitee, unsuccessfully contested the issuance of the permit during the administrative process and on appeal to the circuit court. French now appeals to us, claiming that the VMRC violated her procedural due process rights and failed to exercise properly its discretion in issuing the permit. We disagree and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>I.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-4\">This case comes to us, as it did to the circuit court, pursuant to judicial review provisions of the Virginia Administrative Process Act (VAPA), Code \u00a7\u00a7 2.2-4025 to -4030. We thus review \u201cthe facts in the light most favorable to sustaining the agency\u2019s action.\u201d <em>Comm\u2019r, Va. Dep\u2019t of Soc. Servs. v. Fulton, </em>55 Va.App. 69, 79, 683 S.E.2d 837, 841-42 (2009) (internal quotation marks and alteration omitted); <em>see also Mattaponi Indian Tribe v. Dep\u2019t of Envtl. Quality, </em>43 Va.App. 690, 713, 601 S.E.2d 667, 679 (2004), <em>aff'd in relevant part sub nom. Alliance to Save the Mattaponi v. Dep\u2019t of Envtl. Quality, </em>270 Va. 423, 621 S.E.2d 78 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b275-5\">This case involves a dispute between two neighbors in Frederick County. In 2011, Donald Foor bought property abutting Hogue Creek. As part of the purchase agreement, the seller constructed a bridge across the creek so that Foor could access the property through a private right of way connecting the property to a public road. The \u201clow water bridge\u201d is little more than concrete slab over corrugated steel drainage pipes. App. at 374, 417. The creek typically is \u201conly a few inches deep\u201d and thus, the bridge does not implicate \u201cany navigation issues.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 486.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-6\">The seller built the bridge believing that he did not need a VMRC permit. He did so because he had applied for a permit to construct a similar bridge across Hogue Creek in 2003 and had been \u201cnotified from VMRC that a permit was not required\u201d <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> because VMRC typically did not \u201cexert jurisdiction on non-tidal streams where the drainage area upstream of the impact area is less than five square miles, which was what was thought to be in this situation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 485 (background summary by VMRC staffer); <em>see also id. </em>at 492.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>French, one of Foor\u2019s neighbors, became aware of the bridge and notified the VMRC of her objections to it. Reconsidering their earlier position, VMRC staff concluded that \u201cthe drainage area upstream of the bridge location was greater than five square miles,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 485, and advised Foor to apply for an after-the-fact permit. During the administrative process, VMRC staff received from French detailed written objections to the application.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-4\">In response to her environmental concerns, VMRC staff contacted the Virginia Department of Game and Inland Fisheries and the Virginia Department of Conservation and Recreation. These agencies \u201cdid not see any major environmental impact upon protected species and other resources in the area.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Addressing French\u2019s worries about the possibility that \u201cthe bridge would exacerbate flooding conditions upon her property,\u201d VMRC staff reviewed a flood plain study for the area and \u201cdetermined that a 100-year flood event would not raise flood levels significantly on the upstream areas of the bridge.\u201d <em>Id. </em>French also suggested that the bridge might interfere with the possibility that she would build a \u201clow water bridge\u201d across the creek to her property sometime in the future. <em>Id. </em>at 486. VMRC staff concluded that the presence of Foor\u2019s bridge \u201cwould not necessarily affect [French\u2019s] application\u201d for her own bridge. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b276-5\">VMRC staff presented their findings to the full commission at a public hearing. The written recommendation concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ACQ\">Staff understands the need for the applicant to have access to his property and feels that a low water bridge crossing is an appropriate structure to provide such access. Staff also understands the confusion created by a previous inaccurate determination that a similar project did not require permits from VMRC. In light of this error, staff feels that the assessment of any civil charges or additional fees would be inappropriate.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-6\">Accordingly, after evaluating the merits of the project, and after considering all of the factors contained in \u00a7 28.2-1205(A) of the Code of Virginia, staff recommends approval <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>of the project without any civil charges or additional permit fees.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b277-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 517 (\u201cHabitat Management Division Evaluation\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b277-6\">French appeared at the VMRC hearing to voice her objections to the proposed permit. In her opening remarks, she informed the VMRC that Hogue Creek \u201cmay be a small stream,\u201d but \u201cit\u2019s sort of my stream, and it matters to me.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 486. The first thing that mattered to her, French asserted, was that \u201cthe lawful right of way across Hogue Creek was not where this bridge was constructed.\u201d <em>Id.; see also id. </em>at 503. The properly located right of way, she alleged, was in a location \u201cshared\u201d by her. <em>Id. </em>at 487; <em>see also </em>Oral Argument Audio at 18:00-18:15. She went on to assert, among other things, that the public did not benefit from the bridge, the bridge adversely affected the environment, the \u201cconcrete bunker in the middle of the stream\u201d unfairly \u201cincreases\u201d the value of Foor\u2019s land, <em>id. </em>at 489, and the bridge might negatively affect her future ability to construct a bridge across the creek to access her mountain property, <em>id. </em>at 490-91.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-7\">An engineer hired by Foor testified at the VMRC hearing. His firm conducted a flood plain study, designed the drain field for the bridge, and produced information required by the VMRC staff. He pointed out that, without the bridge, the landowners would be fording the creek with vehicular traffic creating \u201cdisturbance from an environmental standpoint.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 491. The bridge ameliorated this concern by connecting the dirt and gravel right of way, which was \u201cthe only means of ingress and egress\u201d to Foor\u2019s landlocked parcel. <em>Id. </em>The bridge thus benefitted the public, he testified, because the landowners \u201cdon\u2019t have to [ford] the creek any more\u201d \u2014 thus reducing \u201cpollutants in the water\u201d inevitably left by vehicular traffic. <em>Id. </em>at 492. He added that French misunderstood the risk of flooding and explained that the bridge \u201chas no impact [on] the flood zone whatsoever.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b277-8\">After reviewing the staffs recommendation and the evidence received during the public meeting, the VMRC issued the permit. In a letter to French, the VMRC explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b278-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>The Commission reviewed slides of the proposal, all documents in the official record and carefully considered the supporting testimony [Foor\u2019s engineer] presented, as well as your opposing testimony and exhibits. After careful deliberation and after considering all of the factors contained in \u00a7 28.2-1205 of the Code of Virginia, the Commission voted five to three [to] approve the project as presented.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b278-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 343. French appealed to the circuit court pursuant to Code \u00a7 28.2-219, VAPA\u2019s judicial review provision. The circuit court affirmed the VMRC decision, and French appealed to us.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-6\">On appeal, French claims that the VMRC decision violated her procedural due process rights and that the VMRC acted arbitrarily in granting the after-the-fact permit. The circuit court rejected these arguments, as do we.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-7\">A. Procedural Due Process Claim</p>\n<p id=\"b278-8\">French argues on appeal that she has \u201cconstitutionally protected property rights as an adjacent riparian landowner\u201d and that VMRC\u2019s \u201csham\u201d public hearing, resulting in the issuance of Foor\u2019s permit, violated these rights. Appellant\u2019s Br. at 28-29.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We find fault with the assumptions underlying this argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-9\">\u201cThe democratic process presumes a constant interchange of voices.\u201d <em>Nev. Comm\u2019n on Ethics v. Corrigan, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, -, 131 S.Ct. 2343, 2352, 180 L.Ed.2d 150 (2011) (Kennedy, J., concurring). If a governmental body conducts a public hearing and invites the participation of those in attend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>anee, participants may offer their opinions if they are germane to the subject and presented in an orderly manner. <em>See, e.g., Perry Educ. Ass\u2019n v. Perry Local Educators\u2019 Ass\u2019n, </em>460 U.S. 37, 46, 103 S.Ct. 948, 955-56, 74 L.Ed.2d 794 (1983) (approving \u201ctime, place, and manner regulations\u201d if reasonable and viewpoint neutral); <em>Steinburg v. Chesterfield Cnty. Planning Comm\u2019n, </em>527 F.3d 377, 380 (4th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b279-4\">We would not, however, characterize the general right to be heard in a participatory democracy as a constitutional attribute of procedural due process principles. \u201cThe point of due process is to ensure that the government does not deprive anyone of \u2018life, liberty, or property\u2019 arbitrarily and capriciously \u2014 that is, \u2018without due process of law.\u2019 \u201d <em>Va. Dep\u2019t of Alcoholic Bev. Control v. Tyson, </em>63 Va.App. 417, 426, 758 S.E.2d 89, 93 (2014) (quoting U.S. Const, amend. XIV, \u00a7 1). \u201cThe first inquiry in every due process challenge is whether the plaintiff has been deprived of a protected interest in \u2018property\u2019 or \u2018liberty.\u2019 Only after finding the deprivation of a protected interest do we look to see if the State\u2019s procedures comport with due process.\u201d <em>Am. Mfrs. Mut. Ins. Co. v. Sullivan, </em>526 U.S. 40, 59, 119 S.Ct. 977, 989-90, 143 L.Ed.2d 130 (1999); <em>see also McManama v. Plunk, </em>250 Va. 27, 34, 458 S.E.2d 759, 763 (1995). This principle applies to administrative agency hearings no less than it does to any other governmental proceeding. <em>See </em>Richard J. Pierce, Jr., II <em>Administrative Law Treatise </em>\u00a7 9.4, at 578 (4th ed.2002).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b279-5\">French does not claim that the permit deprived her of life or personal liberty. Instead, she claims that the VMRC\u2014 merely by issuing the after-the-fact permit to Foor \u2014 deprived her of \u201creal property rights\u201d and, in particular, her common-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>law \u201criparian\u201d rights. Appellant\u2019s Br. at 7, 28, 39-40. We need not determine the scope of French\u2019s riparian rights, if any, implicated by Foor\u2019s bridge, because the VMRC permit did not (and, as a matter of law, could not) deprive French of any cognizable property rights. The <em>bridge </em>may or may not affect such rights, but the <em>permit </em>does not.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-4\">This seemingly subtle distinction is intrinsic to the very structure of the Constitution. With a few notable exceptions, the Constitution restrains only state action \u2014 not the actions of private individuals. <em>See Edmonson v. Leesville Concrete Co., </em>500 U.S. 614, 620, 111 S.Ct. 2077, 2082-83, 114 L.Ed.2d 660 (1991); <em>Lugar v. Edmondson Oil Co., </em>457 U.S. 922, 924, 102 S.Ct. 2744, 2746-47, 73 L.Ed.2d 482 (1982). It necessarily follows that procedural due process principles \u201capply <em>only if a government action </em>will constitute the impairment of some individual\u2019s life, liberty or property.\u201d Ronald D. Rotunda <em>&amp; </em>John E. Nowak, 3 <em>Constitutional Law: Substance and Procedure </em>\u00a7 17.2, at 5 (5th ed.2012) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b280-5\">In this case, the VMRC issued the permit but did not build the bridge. Thus, the only question is whether the issuance of the permit, by itself, has the legal effect of depriving French of any property rights. As a matter of law, the answer must be \u201cno.\u201d Regulatory permits generally do \u201cnot affect property rights or otherwise adjudicate their merits.\u201d <em>Alliance to Save the Mattaponi, </em>270 Va. at 447, 621 S.E.2d at 91 (citing <em>Zappulla v. Crown, </em>239 Va. 566, 571, 391 S.E.2d 65, 68 (1990)). \u201cSuch regulatory permits determine only the rights of an applicant with relation to the Commonwealth and the public.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 447, 621 S.E.2d at 91-92. Absent specific statutory authority to do so, a permitting agency has \u201cauthority only to issue or to deny the permit,\u201d and that \u201cdecision does not and, by law, cannot affect private rights of action between competing litigants.\u201d <em>Mattaponi Indian Tribe, </em>43 Va.App. at 708, 601 S.E.2d at 676.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b281-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>What is true generally of permitting agencies is also true of the VMRC. The General Assembly made this clear by providing that nothing in the VMRC\u2019s basic law \u201cshall be construed to deprive a riparian landowner of such rights as he may have at common law.\u201d Code \u00a7 28.2-1205(F); <em>accord Zappulla, </em>239 Va. at 569, 391 S.E.2d at 67 (\u201c[T]he <em>sole </em>jurisdiction to resolve conflicting private riparian claims is vested in a court of equity.\u201d (emphasis added)).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In short, because the VMRC permit has no legal effect on French\u2019s property rights, French cannot claim that the VMRC deprived her of any property rights in violation of due process principles.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-4\">This legal conclusion wholly disposes of French\u2019s constitutional challenge. We thus need not address the other grounds asserted by the VMRC and considered by the circuit court for rejecting this portion of French\u2019s argument. \u201cAs an appellate court, we seek \u2018the best and narrowest ground available\u2019 for our decision,\u201d <em>Morris v. City of Va. Beach, </em>58 Va.App. 173, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>180, 707 S.E.2d 479, 482 (2011) (quoting <em>Armstead v. Commonwealth, </em>56 Va.App. 569, 576, 695 S.E.2d 561, 564 (2010)), and we \u201cthus strive to resolve eases \u2018on what we conceive to be the determinative points,\u2019 \u201d <em>id. </em>(quoting Justice Herbert B. Gregory, <em>Shorter Judicial Opinions, </em>34 Va. L.Rev. 362, 365 (1948)).</p>\n<p id=\"b282-4\">B. The VAPA Challenge to the VMRC Permit</p>\n<p id=\"b282-5\">Even though French has no property interest upon which to predicate her due process claim, that does not mean she has no standing to challenge the VMRC\u2019s permit as arbitrary and capricious. While the first issue involves the elements of a constitutional due process claim, the second involves a question of \u201caggrieved party\u201d standing, Code \u00a7 28.2-1205(F), and the statutory guidelines applicable to the VMRC\u2019s discretionary power to issue permits, Code \u00a7 28.2-1205(A).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b282-6\">Under settled VAPA law, the circuit court reviews an agency\u2019s action in a manner \u201cequivalent to an appellate court\u2019s role in an appeal from a trial court.\u201d <em>Boone v. Harrison, </em>52 Va.App. 53, 61, 660 S.E.2d 704, 708 (2008) (internal quotation marks omitted). \u201cThe circuit court has no authority under VAPA to reweigh the facts in the agency\u2019s evidentiary record. VAPA authorizes the court to reject the agency\u2019s findings of fact only if, considering the record as a whole, a reasonable mind would <em>necessarily </em>come to a different conclusion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 61-62, 660 S.E.2d at 708 (internal quotation marks omitted and emphasis in original). Consequently, no court can \u201csubstitute its own judgment for the agency\u2019s on matters committed by statute to the agency\u2019s discretion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 62, 660 S.E.2d at 708.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>Instead, \u201cwhen the appellant challenges a judgment call on a topic on which the agency has been entrusted with wide discretion by the General Assembly, we will overturn the decision only if it can be fairly characterized as arbitrary or capricious and thus a clear abuse of delegated discretion.\u201d <em>Citland, Ltd. v. Commonwealth ex rel. Kilgore, </em>45 Va.App. 268, 275, 610 S.E.2d 321, 324 (2005) (internal quotation marks omitted). \u201cThis standard recognizes the larger premise that, before any legal question can be answered, an <em>a priori </em>question must first be asked \u2014 who has the authority to decide. It is the one question that precedes all others.\u201d <em>Boone, </em>52 Va.App. at 62, 660 S.E.2d at 708.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-4\">The General Assembly \u201chas invested the VMRC with wide discretion in determining whether to issue permits for projects over state-owned subaqueous lands.\u201d <em>Id. </em>As we have explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b283-5\">Relying on the \u201cspecialized competency of the VMRC\u201d on such matters, <em>Palmer v. Commonwealth Marine Res. Comm\u2019n, </em>48 Va.App. 78, 86, 628 S.E.2d 84, 88 (2006), the legislature did not restrict the VMRC\u2019s judgment to any decisionmaking formula intended to dictate the outcome of each permitting decision. Instead, Code \u00a7 28.2-1204 instructs the VMRC to permit \u201creasonable uses\u201d of state-owned bottomland. The VMRC \u201cshall be guided in its deliberations,\u201d Code \u00a7 28.2-1205(A), by the Virginia Constitution\u2019s emphasis on the preservation of the environment, the public\u2019s access to public lands for recreation, and maintenance of all public resources \u201cfor the benefit, enjoyment, and general welfare of the people of the Commonwealth,\u201d Va. Const. Art. IX, \u00a7 1.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b283-6\">Code \u00a7 28.2-1205(A) also directs the VMRC to exercise its authority consistent with the \u201cpublic trust doctrine as defined by the common law of the Commonwealth\u201d and to consider an additional list of specific factors, including the effect of the project on \u201c[a]djacent or nearby properties.\u201d <em>See Palmer, </em>48 Va.App. at 87-88, 628 S.E.2d at 89. \u201cThe presence or absence of any given factor is not dispositive of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>whether a permit should be granted; further, not every factor is applicable in every case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 90, 628 S.E.2d at 90.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b284-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 62-68, 660 S.E.2d at 708-09.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-5\">Applying these principles, we cannot conclude that the VMRC abused its discretion in issuing the permit to Foor. The VMRC reviewed a detailed recommendation from its staff, received testimony from Foor\u2019s engineer, and considered French\u2019s testimony and exhibits. The agency record shows a need for the bridge to accommodate ingress and egress to a landlocked parcel of land. Virginia law disfavors property segmentation that results in inaccessible parcels of land and, in some cases, implies easements and other rights of way for this very reason.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The public at large, not just the landlocked landowner, has an interest in doing so.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b284-6\">In addition, both the VMRC staff and the other agencies they consulted concluded that the bridge provided access without any appreciable damage to the environment.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Foor\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>engineer added that the bridge had the effect of protecting the stream from contaminates that could be deposited from vehicular traffic fording the stream. The VMRC likewise considered the evidence that this stream, typically \u201conly a few inches deep,\u201d did not implicate any \u201cnavigation issues,\u201d and posed no threat to French\u2019s property from flooding. App. at 486.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-4\">We review these facts not to signal our agreement with them or to evaluate the wisdom of issuing a permit based upon them. Like the circuit court, we have \u201cno authority under VAPA to reweigh the facts in the agency\u2019s evidentiary record\u201d or to decide <em>de novo </em>whether we would issue a discretionary permit under these circumstances. <em>Boone, </em>52 Va.App. at 61-62, 660 S.E.2d at 708. The VMRC\u2019s factual findings can be overturned \u201conly if, considering the record as a whole, a reasonable mind would <em>necessarily </em>come to a different conclusion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 62, 660 S.E.2d at 708 (internal quotation marks omitted). French\u2019s challenge to the permit falls far short of satisfying this standard.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b285-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-6\">In sum, French\u2019s procedural due process challenge fails because the VMRC permit did not deprive her of any property <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>rights. Her VAPA challenge to the permit fails because the VMRC\u2019s decision to issue the permit cannot be judicially deemed arbitrary and capricious. We thus affirm the circuit court\u2019s final order upholding the VMRC decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-4\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b275-7\">. The agency record contains a letter, dated January 25, 2005, from the VMRC to Foor\u2019s predecessor in interest.
