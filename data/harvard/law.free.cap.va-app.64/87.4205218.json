On appeal to this Court, appellant argues that the trial court erred by denying appellant\u2019s motion to suppress her statements to the police, contending that \u201claw enforcement conducted a custodial interrogation of appellant without availing her of her <em>Miranda </em>rights and after appellant gave the Commonwealth proper notice of appellant\u2019s claims\u201d as required by Code \u00a7 19.2-266.2. Appellant also argues on appeal that the trial court erred by allowing an expert witness, Detective O\u2019Connell, to \u201ctestify as to intent,\u201d which appellant contends was \u201cthe ultimate issue of fact\u201d pertaining to her charge for possession with intent to distribute marijuana.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> For the following reasons, we affirm appellant\u2019s convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-10\">I. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b135-11\">Applying the established standard of review on appeal, we consider the evidence at trial \u201c \u2018in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, as we must since it was the prevailing party\u2019 \u201d in the trial court. <em>Beasley v. Commonwealth, </em>60 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>Va.App. 381, 391, 728 S.E.2d 499, 504 (2012) (quoting <em>Riner v. Commonwealth, </em>268 Va. 296, 330, 601 S.E.2d 555, 574 (2004)). On February 16, 2012, Richmond police responded to the Hillside Court area of Richmond upon the report of shots fired. As they were investigating this report, they saw a woman running in the area of appellant\u2019s apartment so they approached the apartment and knocked on the door. Appellant answered the door. Office Butler testified that he asked appellant if he and the other officers could \u201ccome inside and talk to [her]\u201d and that appellant replied that they could. Once inside her apartment, Butler noticed in plain view \u201can ashtray with four marijuana blunts inside.\u201d Butler asked appellant about those, and noted that \u201cshe said she had been smoking weed.\u201d Butler also told appellant that he \u201csmelled both burnt and unburnt marijuana.\u201d Appellant then produced a small bag of marijuana from the top of a kitchen cabinet and a larger quantity of marijuana in plastic bags. She also produced some cash from a fruit snack box.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-5\">Officer Butler asked for appellant\u2019s \u201cconsent to search the rest of the residence to make sure there\u2019s nothing else illegal in the house,\u201d and he testified that she \u201csaid yes.\u201d (i.e. that she would consent). At about the same time, another officer, Officer Spann, came back downstairs from the upstairs, where he had taken appellant\u2019s children, and reported that \u201cthere\u2019s some ammunition upstairs\u201d \u2014 causing concern among the officers that there might be a gun in the house. The officers inquired about whether she had a firearm, and, according to Butler, appellant \u201ceventually directed Officer Spann to the closet that was downstairs by the kitchen,\u201d where a revolver was found.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-6\">While Officer Spann was not called as a witness at the suppression hearing, he did testify at the trial which immediately followed the suppression hearing. He stated that, when he asked appellant why she would keep a loaded firearm in a place where children could find and take it, she indicated that she needed the gun for protection because \u201cshe said she was selling weed.\u201d Appellant was arrested and taken into custody.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>Thirteen days prior to trial, appellant\u2019s trial counsel filed, as required by Code \u00a7 19.2-266.2, a written motion to suppress \u201call evidence seized and all statements made incident to or as a result of an illegal entry into and warrantless search of her residence and interrogation,\u201d claiming that \u201csuch evidence was obtained in violation of the Fourth, Fifth, and Fourteenth Amendments of the Constitution of the United States, and Article I, \u00a7\u00a7 8, 10 and 11 of the Constitution of Virginia.\u201d As support for the motion to suppress, appellant\u2019s counsel focused on arguing that the police executed an unlawful, warrantless search and seizure of appellant\u2019s home without having any exigent circumstances and without appellant\u2019s consent.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The written motion to suppress did not specifically allege that appellant\u2019s incriminating statements to the police were the product of an unlawful custodial interrogation in violation of <em>Miranda v. Arizona, </em>384 U.S. 436, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694 (1966). While the written motion to suppress characterized Gregory\u2019s incriminating statements as \u201cfruit of the poisonous tree,\u201d the written motion did not develop an argument pertaining to a Fifth Amendment violation <em>under Miranda </em>although it referred generally to the Fourth, Fifth, and Fourteenth Amendments. The trial judge denied the motion to suppress, stating that \u201cfailure to give <em>Miranda </em>warnings [is] not before the court in this motion.\u201d He explained, \u201cThe motion deals with unlawful entry, warrantless search. The boilerplate language in the introductory paragraph is not enough to put the Commonwealth on notice that failure to give <em>Miranda </em>warnings at a particular time is fatal to the use of statements that were made.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b137-5\">Appellant\u2019s jury trial immediately followed the denial of her motion to suppress. The Commonwealth introduced (during the direct examination of a Department of Forensic Science analyst) a certificate of analysis that the analyst prepared indicating that 4.9 ounces of marijuana were obtained from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>appellant\u2019s residence. In addition, there was evidence admitted that a digital scale and $250 in cash were seized from appellant\u2019s residence. The prosecutor asked Richmond Police Detective Daniel O\u2019Connell, who was received as an expert in the street-level distribution of marijuana, whether he had drawn \u201ca conclusion\u201d whether \u201cthis marijuana that was seized was consistent or inconsistent with personal use.\u201d Appellant\u2019s attorney objected to this question on the ground that the question pointed to \u201cthe ultimate issue for the jury.\u201d The trial judge disagreed and overruled the objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-5\">When O\u2019Connell testified that the circumstances were \u201cinconsistent with personal use,\u201d the prosecutor asked O\u2019Connell to explain what \u201cfactors went into your analysis.\u201d O\u2019Connell then testified, \u201cThe first factor is drug dealing is very \u2014 it\u2019s a business. It\u2019s a big business. And the defendant in this case in my opinion was running it as a business.\u201d Appellant\u2019s counsel objected, stating specifically, \u201cThat goes beyond what he\u2019s here to testify to, whether it\u2019s inconsistent or consistent with personal use or distribution.\u201d Defense counsel added, \u201cConcluding that my client is running a business is not proper testimony for his expertise.\u201d The prosecutor responded that, if O\u2019Connell could reasonably \u201cextrapolate\u201d from the circumstances that \u201cit was some kind of business enterprise,\u201d then the testimony was appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-6\">The trial judge allowed the testimony to be admitted, making the specific finding that Detective O\u2019Connell\u2019s opinion testimony that appellant was running a business was \u201cwithin [O\u2019Connell\u2019s] expertise.\u201d The trial judge did not expressly rule on whether this particular testimony was improper \u201cultimate issue\u201d testimony from an expert witness. The jury found appellant guilty of both offenses, and appellant timely appealed her convictions to this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-7\">II. Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b138-8\">A. <em>Motion to Suppress the Evidence</em></p>\n<p id=\"b138-9\">Appellant challenges the trial court\u2019s decision to deny her motion to suppress incriminating statements that she <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>made to the police. \u201cWhen reviewing a denial of a motion to suppress evidence, an appellate court considers the evidence in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth and will accord the Commonwealth the benefit of all reasonable inferences fairly deducible from that evidence.\u201d <em>Branham v. Commonwealth, </em>283 Va. 273, 279, 720 S.E.2d 74, 77 (2012) (citing <em>Sidney v. Commonwealth, </em>280 Va. 517, 520, 702 S.E.2d 124, 126 (2010)). In addition, \u201cthe defendant has the burden of showing that even when the evidence is reviewed in that light, denying the motion to suppress was reversible error.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Sidney, </em>280 Va. at 522, 702 S.E.2d at 127). \u201cWe review <em>de novo </em>the trial court\u2019s application of the law to the particular facts of the case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Glenn v. Commonwealth, </em>275 Va. 123, 130, 654 S.E.2d 910, 913 (2008)). The trial court\u2019s findings of fact are not disturbed unless plainly wrong or without evidence to support them. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 8.01-680.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-5\">Appellant argues that, because she was not Mirandized before she made various incriminating statements to the police, the trial court erred in not suppressing those statements. However, Code \u00a7 19.2-266.2 states, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b139-6\">A. Defense motions or objections seeking (i) suppression of evidence on the grounds such evidence was obtained in violation of the provisions of the Fourth, Fifth or Sixth Amendments of the Constitution of the United States or Article I, Section 8, 10, or 11 of the Constitution of Virginia proscribing illegal searches and seizures and protecting rights against self-incrimination ... shall be raised by motion or objection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b139-7\"><em>B. Such a motion or objection in a proceeding in circuit court shall be raised in uniting, before trial. </em>The motions or objections shall be filed and notice given to opposing counsel not later than seven days before trial in circuit court.... A hearing on all such motions or objections shall be held not later than three days prior to trial in circuit court, unless such period is waived by the accused, as set by the trial judge. The circuit court may, however, for good <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>cause shown and in the interest of justice, permit the motions or objections to be raised at a later time.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b140-6\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b140-7\">In this case, appellant\u2019s counsel did file a timely pretrial written motion to suppress. However, the issue here is whether the written motion appellant filed with the circuit court actually raised a <em>Miranda </em>claim so as to advise the Commonwealth and the trial judge of that specific claim prior to trial. The conclusion of the written motion states, \u201cThis evidence was the immediate fruit of the entry and search. Any incriminating statements were likewise <em>the fruit of an illegal entry, search, and seizure. Mapp v. Ohio, </em>367 U.S. 643, 81 S.Ct. 1684, 6 L.Ed.2d 1081 (1961).\u201d (Emphasis added). In <em>Mapp, the </em>United States Supreme Court applied the <em>Fourth Amendment </em>exclusionary rule to the States. <em>Id. </em>at 648, 81 S.Ct. at 1687-88; <em>see also, e.g., County of Henrico v. Ehlers, </em>237 Va. 594, 602, 379 S.E.2d 457, 461 (1989); <em>Bellamy v. Commonwealth, </em>60 Va.App. 125, 130, 724 S.E.2d 232, 235 (2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b140-8\">Nowhere in appellant\u2019s \u201cMotion, Memorandum and Notice to Suppress Pursuant to Va.Code \u00a7 19.2-266.2\u201d did appellant ever refer to <em>Miranda </em>or even to \u201ccustodial interrogation.\u201d As the Commonwealth argues, there are a number of rights enumerated in the Fifth Amendment so even a blanket referral to the Fifth Amendment does not necessarily give the Commonwealth or the trial judge notice of a <em>Miranda </em>argument by appellant, as required by Code \u00a7 19.2-266.2.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Furthermore, the Commonwealth argues that Rule 3A:9(b) applies here, which states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b141-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>Any motion made before trial shall be in writing if made in a circuit court, unless the court for good cause shown permits an oral motion. <em>A motion shall state with particularity the ground or grounds on which it is based.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b141-5\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b141-6\">Because a <em>Miranda </em>claim is not actually raised \u2014 and certainly not raised \u201cwith particularity\u201d \u2014 in the pre-trial written motion to suppress, the Commonwealth asserts that appellant failed to satisfy Rule 3A:9(b) with respect to her <em>Miranda </em>claim that she later raised at the suppression hearing. Appellant actually had at least two ways to argue in her written motion to suppress that her statements to the officer should be suppressed. First, she could argue, as she did, that the statements were derivative of an illegal search (that was not consensual) and seizure under the Fourth Amendment (i.e., \u201cfruit of the poisonous tree\u201d). Second, she could argue that the statements were illegally obtained \u2014 independent of any Fourth Amendment violation \u2014 because the statements were the product of an unlawful custodial interrogation. Here, appellant\u2019s counsel made the first argument (i.e., fruit of the poisonous tree) in her written motion to suppress. While never making the second argument in the written motion to suppress, appellant changed course during the actual suppression hearing and tried to make that argument based on <em>Miranda. </em>Because her written motion failed to refer to <em>Miranda </em>or to allege an improper custodial interrogation, the trial court ruled correctly that Code \u00a7 19.2-266.2 would not allow appellant to make such an argument in the actual suppression hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-7\">B. <em>\u201cUltimate Issue\u201d Testimony</em></p>\n<p id=\"b141-8\">On appeal we review the trial court\u2019s decisions as to the admissibility of testimony to determine if the trial court abused its discretion. <em>See, e.g., Coe v. Commonwealth, </em>231 Va. 83, 87, 340 S.E.2d 820, 823 (1986). Appellant argues that the trial judge abused his discretion in permitting Detective O\u2019Connell to deliver opinion testimony on the \u201cultimate issue of fact\u201d \u2014 i.e., appellant\u2019s intent to distribute marijuana. Ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>pellant specifically points to Detective O\u2019Connell\u2019s expert opinion testimony that appellant was \u201crunning it as a business.\u201d Appellant contends that this testimony invaded the jury\u2019s role of determining whether appellant had the required intent to distribute, given that \u201crunning it as a business\u201d would suggest that appellant was selling marijuana.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-5\">There is a longstanding jurisprudential rule against an expert in a criminal case giving \u201chis opinion upon the precise or ultimate fact in issue.\u201d <em>See Webb v. Commonwealth, </em>204 Va. 24, 33, 129 S.E.2d 22, 29 (1963). This rule is now codified in Virginia\u2019s Rules of Evidence, which states, \u201cIn criminal proceedings, opinion testimony on the ultimate issues of fact is not admissible.\u201d Rule 2:704(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b142-6\">Assuming without deciding that it was error for the trial court to allow Detective O\u2019Connell\u2019s testimony that appellant was \u201crunning it as a business,\u201d it was nevertheless harmless error because there was so much other evidence properly before the trial court for the jury to convict appellant. Not only was there all of the marijuana found in several locations in appellant\u2019s residence, including the marijuana that appellant retrieved for the police, but also appellant\u2019s comment that she had the firearm in her home because she \u201csold weed.\u201d Code \u00a7 8.01-678 states, \u201cWhen it plainly appears from the record and the evidence given at the trial that the parties have had a fair trial on the merits and substantial justice has been reached, no judgment shall be arrested or reversed ... [f]or any other defect, imperfection, or omission in the record, or for any error committed on the trial.\u201d <em>See also Ferguson v. Commonwealth, 396 </em>S.E.2d 675 (1990) (stating that Code \u00a7 8.01-678 makes harmless error review \u201crequired in <em>all </em>cases\u201d). On brief, appellant argues that any harmless error review must be under the constitutional harmless error standard, but she provides no authority for that contention. The Supreme Court\u2019s post <em>-Llamera</em><footnotemark><em>4</em></footnotemark><em> </em>decision in <em>Rodriguez v. Commonwealth, </em>249 Va. 203, 454 S.E.2d 725 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>(1995), indicates that the non-constitutional harmless error standard should be used here. <em>Id. </em>at 208, 454 S.E.2d at 728.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-5\">In that regard, after Detective O\u2019Connell\u2019s testimony that appellant was \u201crunning it as a business,\u201d the prosecutor questioned <em>O\u2019Connell </em>\u2014 without <em>objection </em>\u2014 as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b143-6\">Q: And so the evidence was that there was $250 in this box along with the bags of marijuana. What conclusion can you draw from that without getting into how things were folded? A: <em>That it is set up for distribution. </em>There were also other factors leading into that in that there was more marijuana recovered outside of the box. There was U.S. currency found on her person. So everything \u2014 my conclusion is based on <em>everything that was needed for dealing marijuana </em>was inside that box, five separate individual bags of marijuana with over four ounces, $250 U.S. currency which is ample currency to give change if somebody needs change.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b143-7\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b143-8\">In addition, Detective O\u2019Connell then testified it was \u201ccommon\u201d for \u201cdrug dealers\u201d to have digital scales and firearms\u2014 and that, even without considering appellant\u2019s statement to Officer Spann that she had a firearm because she \u201csold weed,\u201d the detective testified that he \u201cwould still draw the conclusion that it\u2019s inconsistent with personal use <em>and it was there for </em>distribution.\u201d (Emphasis added). Appellant also did not object to these statements from Detective O\u2019Connell.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-9\">In short, none of these statements by Detective O\u2019Connell were objected to by appellant\u2019s counsel at trial, and so these statements \u2014 which were admitted at trial without any \u201cultimate issue\u201d objection \u2014 are now part of the record before this Court on appeal.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Therefore, we conclude that the testimony <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>by Detective O\u2019Connell that appellant does challenge on appeal as reaching the \u201cultimate issue\u201d of intent is <em>cumulative </em>of other expert testimony, which was never challenged on the ground that it violated the \u201cultimate issue\u201d rule. <em>See Delaware v. Van Arsdall, </em>475 U.S. 678, 674, 106 S.Ct. 1431, 1432-33, 89 L.Ed.2d 674 (1986) (explaining that the question of whether an error \u201cis harmless in a particular case depends upon a host of factors, all readily accessible to reviewing courts,\u201d including whether the testimony that should not have been admitted \u201cwas cumulative\u201d of other evidence before the factfinder); <em>see also, e.g., Sargent v. Commonwealth, </em>5 Va. App. 143, 154, 360 S.E.2d 895, 903 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b144-5\">Furthermore, at trial, Officer Spann testified that he asked appellant why she had \u201ca firearm where her children could get to it.\u201d According to Spann, appellant replied that she had the firearm because \u201cshe was selling weed\u201d and that she was selling marijuana because \u201cshe needed the rent money.\u201d Therefore, since we decided <em>supra </em>that appellant\u2019s statements are admissible \u2014 and need not be suppressed \u2014 Officer Spann\u2019s testimony here also is a significant factor in a harmless error analysis relating to any improper testimony by Detective O\u2019Connell because the jury could conclude from appellant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>admission to Officer Spann that she intended to distribute the marijuana in her possession.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-5\">In <em>Llamera v. Commonwealth, </em>243 Va. 262, 414 S.E.2d 597 (1992), the Supreme Court reaffirmed the rule that an expert witness \u201cmay be permitted to express his opinion relative to the existence or nonexistence of facts not within common knowledge\u201d \u2014 but \u201ccannot give his opinion upon the precise or ultimate fact in issue, which must be left to the jury or to the court trying the case without a jury for determination.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 264, 414 S.E.2d at 598 (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). In <em>Llamera, </em>the Supreme Court held that the trial court\u2019s decision to permit an expert to opine that the quantity of cocaine involved in that case \u201cwould suggest that the owner of the cocaine <em>was a person who sold cocaine </em>\u201d was reversible error because that testimony \u201cclearly expressed an opinion upon an ultimate issue of fact\u201d \u2014 i.e., whether Llamera had the requisite intent to distribute cocaine. <em>Id. </em>at 265, 414 S.E.2d at 599 (emphasis added).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b145-6\">In addition, in <em>Llamera, </em>the trial court had inculpatory evidence of Llamera\u2019s involvement, when he essentially confessed to the police \u201cthat the cocaine was his and that he used and sold cocaine.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 264, 414 S.E.2d at 598. The Supreme Court found that was not enough additional evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>to say that the error in admitting the testimony on the ultimate issue was harmless error. <em>Id. </em>at 265-66, 414 S.E.2d at 599.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-4\">The circumstances of this case, however, are distinguishable from those in <em>Llamera. </em>Here, we have appellant\u2019s acknowledgement to the police that she possessed the firearm because she sold marijuana. However, unlike in <em>Llamera, </em>this <em>de facto </em>confession must be considered <em>in addition to </em>other portions of Detective O\u2019Connell\u2019s testimony to which appellant never objected. Here, we have additional expert opinion testimony relating to drug distribution at two other points during trial\u2014 which the expert made without objection \u2014 and from this testimony the jury also could have drawn the conclusion that appellant was selling marijuana.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-5\">Moreover, the Supreme Court has also explained on multiple occasions, \u201cSeveral factors may constitute probative evidence of intent to distribute a controlled substance. These factors include the quantity of the drugs seized, the manner in which they are packaged, and the presence of an unusual amount of cash, equipment related to drug distribution, or firearms.\u201d <em>McCain v. Commonwealth, </em>261 Va. 483, 493, 545 S.E.2d 541, 547 (2001); <em>see also, e.g., Dukes v. Commonwealth, </em>227 Va. 119, 122, 313 S.E.2d 382, 383 (1984); <em>Colbert v. Commonwealth, </em>219 Va. 1, 4, 244 S.E.2d 748, 749 (1978). In this case, the jury had before it several factors that also would support the conclusion that appellant intended to distribute drugs \u2014 i.e., that 4.9 ounces of marijuana were obtained from appellant\u2019s residence, that much of this marijuana was individually packaged, that $250 was recovered from a fruit snack box, that a digital scale was also recovered from appellant\u2019s residence, and that appellant possessed a firearm. <em>See Bandy v. Commonwealth, 52 </em>Va.App. 510, 518, 664 S.E.2d 519, 522 (2008) (\u201cCourts have often recognized that \u2018the connection between illegal drug operations and guns is a tight one.\u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>Jones v. Commonwealth, </em>272 Va. 692, 701 n. 3, 636 S.E.2d 403, 407 n. 3 (2006))); <em>see also United States v. Grogins, </em>163 F.3d 795, 799 (4th Cir.1998). The jury could reach its conclusion after considering all of these factors, in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>addition to Detective O\u2019Connell\u2019s expert opinion testimony that the circumstances here were inconsistent with personal use of marijuana \u2014 which, as we have explained, was properly admitted by the trial judge. <em>See supra </em>at 11, fn. 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-5\">In short, unlike in <em>Llamera, </em>here there is overwhelming evidence in the record on appeal that proves the ultimate issue before the jury. Therefore, even assuming without deciding that the admission of Detective O\u2019Connell\u2019s testimony that appellant was \u201crunning it as a business\u201d was error, that testimony is only cumulative of significant other expert testimony that was admitted without objection \u2014 as well as the evidence of appellant\u2019s admission that she possessed the firearm because she \u201csold weed\u201d \u2014 and also other evidence and testimony in the record indicating that the circumstances here were inconsistent with solely a personal use of marijuana. <em>See Van Arsdall, </em>475 U.S. at 674, 106 S.Ct. at 1432-33; <em>Sargent, </em>5 Va.App. at 154, 360 S.E.2d at 903. The result in <em>Llamera </em>is not controlling here because, in this case, we have significantly more evidence in the record that makes any evidence admitted by error here simply cumulative such that it could not have affected the jury\u2019s decision. <em>See Rodriguez, 249 </em>Va. at 208, 454 S.E.2d at 728 (\u201cIn sum, the accused has had a fair trial according to law, and the proof is conclusive of his guilt; any error in admitting the expert\u2019s testimony was utterly harmless.\u201d (citing Code \u00a7 8.01-678)).</p>\n<p id=\"b147-6\">Any error in admitting the detective\u2019s testimony that appellant is \u201crunning it as a business\u201d was simply harmless error. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 8.01-678. For these reasons, we will not disturb appellant\u2019s conviction for possession of marijuana with intent to distribute or appellant\u2019s conviction for possession of a firearm by a convicted felon.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-7\">III. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b147-8\">The trial court did not err in denying the motion to suppress the statements appellant made to the officers that were admitted into evidence by the trial court. Even assuming without deciding that it was error to allow the detective to testify that appellant was \u201crunning it as a business\u201d because it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>was testimony on the ultimate issue in the case, that error was harmless because it was cumulative of significant other such evidence before the court that was admitted without objection. Accordingly, we affirm both of appellant\u2019s felony convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-5\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b135-12\">. Appellant also requested appellate review on four other assignments of error noted in her petition for appeal, but the Court did not grant the petition for appeal on those assignments of error.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b137-6\">. Appellant\u2019s assignment of error related to a warrantless search without her consent or without exigent circumstances was not granted, and, therefore, it is not presently before the Court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b140-9\">. For example, a defendant might claim that an incriminating statement or confession actually \"was coerced, in violation of his Fifth Amendment rights.\u201d <em>Sellers v. Commonwealth, </em>41 Va.App. 268, 276, 584 S.E.2d 452, 456 (2003). Such a claim is not premised on the failure to give <em>Miranda </em>warnings but on other circumstances, such as threats made against a suspect that involve physical coercion, that could render the suspect's statements involuntary. <em>See id. </em>at 276, 584 S.E.2d at 457.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b142-7\">. <em>See Llamera v.

These statements from Detective O\u2019Connell reflected his expert opinion that the circumstances in this case were generally consistent with the distribution of illegal drugs. They were of a different nature than the detective\u2019s earlier opinion testimony that appellant specifically was \"running\u201d a \"business.\u201d Therefore, appellant's objection to O\u2019Connell's testimony that appellant was \"running it as a business\u201d did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>place the trial court on notice that appellant also intended to object to O'Connell\u2019s later testimony that the circumstances here were consistent with the distribution of illegal drugs \u2014 to which no objection was made. <em>See Brown v. Commonwealth, </em>279 Va. 210, 217, 688 S.E.2d 185, 189 (2010) (explaining that Code \u00a7 8.01-384 only eliminates the need to make a further objection when the \"trial court is aware of a litigant\u2019s legal position and the litigant did not expressly waive\u201d that position); <em>cf. Donahue v. Commonwealth, </em>225 Va. 145, 153, 300 S.E.2d 768, 772 (1983) (holding that, once the trial judge overruled the defendant\u2019s objection to the admission of a handwritten note, the defendant was not required to object once again every time the Commonwealth referred to the same handwritten note); <em>Johnson v. Commonwealth, </em>20 Va.App. 547, 552-53, 458 S.E.2d 599, 601-02 (1995) (en banc) (holding that the issue was preserved for appeal where the defendant's counsel properly objected that the defendant could not be convicted of use of a firearm in the attempted commission of unlawful wounding, counsel never wavered in this position, and the issue remained the same throughout the proceedings).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b145-7\">. This Court has interpreted the Supreme Court's <em>Llamera </em>decision as not affecting this Court's <em>pre-Llamera </em>holding in <em>Davis v. Commonwealth, </em>12 Va.App. 728, 733, 406 S.E.2d 922, 925 (1991), which held that the factfinder could rely on expert testimony that the quantity of illegal drugs in question \"was inconsistent with an individual\u2019s personal use.\u201d <em>See Shackleford v. Commonwealth, 32 </em>Va.App. 307, 327, 528 S.E.2d 123, 133 (2000) (where this Court, in a <em>post-Llamera </em>decision, explained, \"Expert testimony, usually that of a police officer familiar with narcotics, is routinely offered to prove the significance of the weight and packaging of drugs regarding whether it is for personal use.\u201d); <em>see also, e.g., Burrell v. Commonwealth, </em>58 Va.App. 417, 434, 710 S.E.2d 509, 517 (2011); <em>Ervin v. Commonwealth, </em>57 Va.App. 495, 522, 704 S.E.2d 135, 148 (2011) (en banc); <em>Williams v. Commonwealth, </em>52 Va.App. 194, 202, 662 S.E.2d 627, 631 (2008); <em>Askew v. Commonwealth, </em>40 Va.App. 104, 109, 578 S.E.2d 58, 60 (2003). Thus, Detective O'Connell\u2019s testimony that the circumstances here were inconsistent with personal use of marijuana was properly before the jury for its consideration.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
