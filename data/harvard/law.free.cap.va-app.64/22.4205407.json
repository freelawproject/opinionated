Barnes (\u201cappellant\u201d) appeals a ruling of the Fairfax County Circuit Court (\u201ctrial court\u201d) granting Lucille F. Barnes\u2019 (\u201cappellee\u201d) motion to strike appellant\u2019s evidence in appellant\u2019s petition to modify spousal support. On appeal, appellant first argues that the trial court erred by granting appellee\u2019s motion to strike on the ground that appellant failed to prove a change in circumstances that warrants a modification in spousal support. Next, appellant argues that the trial court erred by failing to take judicial notice of appellant\u2019s monthly income in 1991 as recorded in <em>Barnes v. Barnes, </em>16 Va.App. 98, 428 S.E.2d 294 (1993). Finally, appellant argues that the trial court erred by failing to apply the correct standard for evaluating a motion to strike when considering the testimony of Christopher Blank (\u201cBlank\u201d). For the following reasons, we affirm in part and dismiss in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-10\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b72-11\">\u201cAccording to well-settled principles of appellate review, when the trial court grants a motion to strike the plaintiffs evidence, we review the evidence on appeal in the light most favorable to the plaintiff.\u201d <em>Green v. Ingram, </em>269 Va. 281, 284, 608 S.E.2d 917, 919 (2005) (citing <em>Perdieu v. Blackstone Family Practice Ctr., Inc., </em>264 Va. 408, 411, 568 S.E.2d 703, 704 (2002)); <em>see also Bryan v. Burt, </em>254 Va. 28, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>30-31, 486 S.E.2d 536, 537 (1997). So viewed, the evidence is as follows.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-4\">The parties were married in June 1981 and divorced in December 1991. Although the divorce was granted in appellant\u2019s favor on the ground of adultery, appellee was nevertheless awarded $1,200 per month in spousal support. This award was appealed to, and affirmed by, this Court in <em>Barnes v. Barnes, </em>16 Va.App. 98, 428 S.E.2d 294 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b73-5\">More than two decades later, appellant filed a petition to amend spousal support, which the trial court heard in May 2013. At the hearing on appellant\u2019s petition, Blank testified that he was appellant\u2019s former business partner and is the current president of Love, Barnes and McKew Insurance Adjusters. In December 2006, Blank, along with other employees of the business, entered into a \u201cBuy/Sell Agreement\u201d with appellant, whereby they purchased appellant\u2019s interest in the business. The agreement went into effect in January 2008, at which point appellant retired. Under the terms of the agreement, the buyers agreed to pay appellant a total of $500,000 in various installments. The agreement terminated on December 23, 2011, when the last installment was paid.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-6\">Appellant was called as the next witness, but he was unable to answer many questions or even provide his home address. The trial judge allowed appellant\u2019s counsel to ask some leading questions, which resulted in appellant affirming that he had dementia and heart problems.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-7\">Appellant\u2019s last witness was Sharon Lewis (\u201cLewis\u201d). Lewis is appellant\u2019s live-in caretaker. She does all the cooking and cleaning, gives appellant his medications, pays some of his bills, takes him to the doctor, and provides any other necessary help. Lewis testified that appellant has \u201clost thirty pounds in the last six months. He is forgetful. I\u2019ve taken over \u2014 he can\u2019t \u2014 he doesn\u2019t do math. He doesn\u2019t have any comprehension of a lot of things.\u201d Lewis also testified that, at the time of the hearing, appellant\u2019s income consisted of $1,242 per month from two annuities and $2,202 per month from social security.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>After appellant concluded his case-in-chief, appellee moved to strike appellant\u2019s evidence, arguing that it failed to prove a change of circumstances that justified amending the current spousal support award. The trial court granted appellee\u2019s motion stating,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b74-5\">You\u2019ve got to show an economic change of circumstances .... Coming in and saying, \u201cWoe is me\u201d at this point isn\u2019t enough____You can\u2019t just come in and say \u201cI am in a bad situation today,\u201d and then presume that I was in a good situation in 199[1]----</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b74-8\">Appellant subsequently filed a motion for reconsideration, which was heard on October 10, 2013. At the hearing on his motion, appellant argued that the trial court should take judicial notice of appellant\u2019s monthly income of $7,700 in 1991, as is recorded in <em>Barnes, </em>16 Va.App. 98, 428 S.E.2d 294. The trial court declined to do so, stating that the opinion was not in evidence. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-9\">II. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b74-10\">A. Change In Circumstances</p>\n<p id=\"b74-11\">On appeal, appellant first contends that the trial court erred by granting appellee\u2019s motion to strike on the ground that appellant failed to present sufficient evidence to demonstrate a change in circumstances that warrants a modification of the existing spousal support award. Specifically, appellant argues that the trial court erred by reasoning that he must prove his financial status as it existed in 1991 in order to show a change in circumstances. Additionally, appellant argues that both his dementia and retirement, standing alone, were sufficient evidence to support a holding that appellant has suffered a change in circumstances that warrants a modification of spousal support.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-12\">When considering on appeal a trial court\u2019s decision to grant a motion to strike, \u201cit is [this Court\u2019s] duty to view the evidence and all reasonable inferences therefrom in the light most favorable to the plaintiff whose evidence was struck.\u201d <em>Costner v. Lackey, </em>223 Va. 377, 381, 290 S.E.2d 818, 820 (1982) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>(citing <em>Warehouse v. Prudential Storage, </em>208 Va. 784, 790, 161 S.E.2d 86, 90 (1968)).</p>\n<p id=\"b75-5\">Code \u00a7 20-109(A) provides that \u201c[u]pon petition of either party the court may increase, decrease, or terminate the amount or duration of any spousal support and maintenance ... as the circumstances may make proper.\u201d Under this provision, the party moving for a modification of support payments must prove \u201cboth a material change in circumstances and that this change warrants a modification of support.\u201d <em>Schoenwetter v. Schoenwetter, </em>8 Va.App. 601, 605, 383 S.E.2d 28, 30 (1989). Furthermore, the \u201cmaterial change in circumstances must have occurred after the most recent judicial review of the award.\u201d <em>Moreno v. Moreno, </em>24 Va.App. 190, 195, 480 S.E.2d 792, 795 (1997) (citing <em>Hiner v. Hadeed, </em>15 Va.App. 575, 577, 425 S.E.2d 811, 812 (1993)).</p>\n<p id=\"b75-6\">In the present case, appellant argues that the trial court should have determined that both his dementia and retirement constituted a change in circumstances regardless of his financial status in 1991. Other than death, remarriage, or cohabitation \u201cin a relationship analogous to marriage,\u201d Code \u00a7 20-109(A) and (D), \u201cthe [only] \u2018circumstances\u2019 which make \u2018proper\u2019 an increase, reduction or cessation of spousal support under Code \u00a7 20-109 <em>are financial and economic </em>ones.\u201d <em>Hollowell v. Hollowell, </em>6 Va.App. 417, 419, 369 S.E.2d 451, 452-53 (1988) (emphasis added). Or, in other words, the change \u201c \u2018must bear upon the financial needs of the dependent spouse or the ability of the supporting spouse to pay.\u2019 \u201d <em>Moreno, </em>24 Va.App. at 195, 480 S.E.2d at 795 (quoting <em>Hollowell, </em>6 Va.App. at 419, 369 S.E.2d at 452).</p>\n<p id=\"b75-7\">In the present case, appellant failed to show how, if at all, his dementia and retirement have adversely affected his financial and economic status since the previous spousal support award. Rather, appellant\u2019s evidence only demonstrated that he developed dementia, retired, and currently has a monthly income of $3,444 \u2014 notably absent is any evidence demonstrating how appellant\u2019s income is different than it was 1991. Viewing this evidence in the light most favorable to appellant, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>it failed to show that appellant has suffered any \u201cfinancial or economic\u201d changes in circumstances, <em>Hollowell, </em>6 Va.App. at 419, 369 S.E.2d at 452-53, that \u201cbear upon ... [his] ability ... to pay\u201d appellee\u2019s spousal support, <em>Moreno, </em>24 Va.App. at 195, 480 S.E.2d at 795. Phrased differently, there is no indication that appellant\u2019s current financial status \u2014 and thereby his ability to pay appellee\u2019s spousal support \u2014 is any different than it was in 1991.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Without such a showing, the trial court was without any basis for determining how, if at all, the current spousal support order should be modified.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-5\">Therefore, as appellant\u2019s evidence failed to demonstrate a change in circumstances that justifies a modification in the existing spousal support order, the trial court did not err by granting appellee\u2019s motion to strike.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-6\">B. Judicial Notice</p>\n<p id=\"b76-7\">Appellant next argues that the trial court erred by failing to take judicial notice of appellant\u2019s monthly income in 1991 as recorded in <em>Barnes, </em>16 Va.App. 98, 428 S.E.2d 294.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-8\">\u201cJudicial notice permits a court to determine the existence of a fact without formal evidence tending to support that fact.\u201d <em>Taylor v. Commonwealth, </em>28 Va.App. 1, 7, 502 S.E.2d 113, 116 (1998) (citation omitted). Generally, \u201c[a] trial court may take judicial notice of those facts that are either (1) so \u2018generally known\u2019 within the jurisdiction or (2) so \u2018easily ascertainable\u2019 by reference to reliable sources that reasonably informed people in the community would not regard them as reasonably subject to dispute.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Ryan v. Commonwealth, </em>219 Va. 439, 445, 247 S.E.2d 698, 703 (1978)); <em>see also </em>Rule 2:201 (judicial notice of adjudicative facts). \u201cThe taking of judicial notice is generally within the discretion of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>the trial court.\u201d <em>Ryan, </em>219 Va. at 446, 247 S.E.2d at 703. \u201cA trial court\u2019s discretion to take judicial notice, however, is not without limits.\u201d <em>Taylor, </em>28 Va.App. at 8, 502 S.E.2d at 116.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-5\">It is well-settled that both trial courts and appellate courts will take judicial notice of the case records in the proceeding at bar. <em>Peterson v. Haynes, </em>145 Va. 653, 658, 134 S.E. 675, 676 (1926). Appellate courts may also notice prior proceedings in the same case, <em>Haynes v. Glenn, </em>197 Va. 746, 752, 91 S.E.2d 433, 437 (1956), and their own records in other cases, <em>Harris v. Commonwealth, </em>262 Va. 407, 413, 551 S.E.2d 606, 609 (2001). Trial courts, however, \u201cwill not take judicial notice of [their] records, judgments and orders in other and different cases or proceedings, <em>even though such cases or proceedings may be between the same parties and in relation to the same subject matter.\u201d Fleming v. Anderson, </em>187 Va. 788, 794, 48 S.E.2d 269, 272 (1948) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b77-6\">In <em>Bernau v. Nealon, </em>219 Va. 1039, 1043, 254 S.E.2d 82, 85 (1979), the Supreme Court summarized this rule as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b77-7\">[trial] court[s] will not travel outside the record of the case before it in order to take notice of the proceedings in another case, even between the same parties and in the same court, unless the proceedings are put into evidence. The reason for the rule is that the decision of a cause must depend upon the evidence introduced. If the courts should recognize judicially facts adjudicated in another case, it makes those facts, though unsupported by evidence in the case at hand, conclusive against the opposing party; while if they had been properly introduced they might have been met and overcome by him.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b77-8\">This rule, however, does not prohibit the introduction of a certified copy of another court\u2019s records into evidence. <em>Ballard v. Thomas &amp; Annon, </em>60 Va. (19 Gratt.) 14, 18 (1868). Indeed, \u201c[t]he usual mode of proving the record of another court, is by the production of a certified copy.\u201d <em>Id.; see also </em>Code \u00a7 8.01-389(A) (\u201cThe records of any judicial proceeding and any other official records of any court of this Common<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>wealth shall be received as prima facie evidence provided that such records are authenticated and certified by the clerk of the court where preserved to be a true record.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b78-4\">Thus, in the present case, appellant could have moved for this Court\u2019s opinion in <em>Barnes, </em>16 Va.App. 98, 428 S.E.2d 294, to be admitted into evidence before the trial court, but he did not. Rather, he asked the trial court to take judicial notice of an adjudicated fact from that opinion, which might have been dispositive in the case at bar. While trial courts generally have discretion regarding whether to take judicial notice, a trial court has no discretion to take judicial notice of an adjudicated fact from another case unless that case is offered into evidence. As such, the trial court in the present case did not err when it declined to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-5\">C. Motion to Strike Standard</p>\n<p id=\"b78-6\">In his third assignment of error, appellant argues that the trial court \u201cdid not correctly apply the standards for evaluating a motion to strike\u201d when evaluating Blank\u2019s testimony. This argument, however, is procedurally defaulted.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-7\">Rule 5A:20(e) requires that appellant\u2019s opening brief include the \u201cprinciples of law, the argument, and the authorities relating to <em>each </em>assignment of error.\u201d (Emphasis added). Appellant\u2019s brief does not meet these requirements regarding his third assignment of error. Instead, it relies on broad and conclusory assertions without a single citation to any controlling legal authority that supports his position.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-8\">As this Court noted in <em>Buchanan v. Buchanan, </em>14 Va.App. 53, 56, 415 S.E.2d 237, 239 (1992), \u201c[statements unsupported by argument, authority, or citations to the record <em>do not merit appellate consideration. </em>We will not search the record for errors in order to interpret the appellant\u2019s contention and correct deficiencies in a brief.\u201d (Emphasis added).; <em>see also Fadness v. Fadness, </em>52 Va.App. 833, 850, 667 S.E.2d 857, 865 (2008) (\u201c \u2018[W]hen a party\u2019s failure to strictly adhere to the requirements of Rule 5A:20(e) is significant, the Court of Appeals may ... treat a question presented as waived.\u2019 \u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>(quoting <em>Parks v. Parks, </em>52 Va.App. 663, 664, 666 S.E.2d 547, 548 (2008))).</p>\n<p id=\"b79-4\">Accordingly, this Court holds that appellant\u2019s third assignment of error fails to satisfy the requirements of Rule 5A:20(e) and therefore does not merit appellate consideration. Assignment of error three therefore is dismissed pursuant to Rule 5A:26.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-5\">D. Attorney\u2019s Fees</p>\n<p id=\"b79-6\">Appellee requests costs and attorney\u2019s fees for matters relating to this appeal.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b79-7\">The rationale for the appellate court being the proper forum to determine the propriety of an award of attorney\u2019s fees for efforts expended on appeal is clear. The appellate court has the opportunity to view the record in its entirety and determine whether the appeal is frivolous or whether other reasons exist for requiring additional payment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b79-8\"><em>O\u2019Loughlin v. O\u2019Loughlin, </em>23 Va.App. 690, 695, 479 S.E.2d 98, 100 (1996). In this context, and upon consideration of the entire record, this Court holds that appellee 'is not entitled to costs or attorney\u2019s fees associated with this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-9\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b79-10\">Therefore, this Court holds that the trial court did not err by striking appellant\u2019s evidence because it was insufficient to support a finding of a change in circumstances that warrants a modification in spousal support. This Court also holds that the trial court did not abuse its discretion by failing to take judicial notice of an adjudicated fact from this Court\u2019s opinion in <em>Barnes, </em>16 Va.App. 98, 428 S.E.2d 294. Finally, this Court holds that appellant\u2019s third assignment of error does not merit appellate consideration under Rule 5A:20(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b79-11\">\n<em>Affirmed, in part; dismissed, in part.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b76-9\">. While appellant\u2019s evidence established that his current monthly expenses exceed his monthly income, there was no evidence presented from which the trial court could have concluded that this was not also the state of appellant\u2019s financial condition in 1991. As the trial court noted, appellant cannot simply say \" '[w]oe is me\u2019 ... 'I am in a bad situation today,' and then [ask this Court to] presume that I was in a good situation in 199[1].\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
