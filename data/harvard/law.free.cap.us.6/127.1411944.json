As, if a verdict be found for the debt, damages and costs, and the judgment be only for the debt and damages, the defendant may assign for error that the judgment was not also for costs, although the error is for his advantage.</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b82-9\">Here, it was the duty of the court to see that they had jurisdiction, for the consent of parties could not give it. It is, therefore, an error of the court, and the plaintiff has a right to take advantage of it. 2 Bac. Abr. tit. Error, K. <em>4 </em>; <em>Beecher's Case, </em>8 Co. 59 <em>a; </em>1 Roll.
