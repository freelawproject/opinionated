This is an action of debt, upon a bond given by the defendant\u2019s testator, to the testator of the plaintiff, on the 2d day of March 1775. The defendant, among other pleas, pleads in bar an act of the general assembly of the state of North Carolina, passed in the year 1715, entitled, \u201c an act concerning proving wills and granting letters of administration, and to prevent frauds in the management of ^intestate estates,\u201d the 9th section of which was in the following words : \u201c And be it further enacted, that creditors of any persons deceased, shall make their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>\u25a0claim within seven years after the death of said debtor, otherwise such creditors shall be for ever barred.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b173-6\">To which plea, the plaintiff replies, in substance, that the plaintiff\u2019s testator was, at his death, a British subject, and the debt within the true intent and operation of the fourth article of the treaty of peace concluded between the King of Great Britain and the United States.

On which question, the opinions of the judges were opposed. Whereupon, on a motion of the plaintiff, by his counsel, that the point on which the disagreement hath happened may, during the term, be stated under the direction of the judges, and certified, under the \u00a1seal of the court, to the supreme court, to be finally decided : it is ordered, \u25a0that the foregoing state of the pleadings and the following statement of facts, which is made under the direction of the judges, be certified, according to the request of the plaintiff, by his counsel, and the law in that case made- \u25a0and provided <em>; to </em>wit :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b173-8\">1st.

(Iredell\u2019s Digest of the Laws of N. Carolina, p. 30.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b173-16\">1. The first inquiry involved in this general question is, whether that section was repealed, before its operation upon the present case. We contend, that it was repealed : 1st. By the act of assembly of North Carolina, passed in April 1784, c. 23, p. 492,<footnotemark>(b)</footnotemark> which makes a *different provision on the same subject. Its preamble refers to the 9th section of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>the act of 1715, and the 2d section makes the estate liable to creditors, without being subject to limitation or time,\u201d which is a negative mode of expression, and clearly repeals the former provision in the act of 1715. But even without such negative words, a statute may be repealed by a subsequent act,, which makes a different provision on the same subject. 4 Bac. Abr. tit. Statute. And although the act of 1784 mentions only administrators, yet it evidently applies to executors also. Indeed, the term administrators comprehends executors, for every executor is an administrator; they both plead <em>plene administravit, </em>and the only difference between them is, that one is-created by the act of law, and the other by the act of the party. Even the statute of treasons, 25 <em>Edw. III., </em>stat. 5, c. 2, in which it is declared to bepetit treason, \u201c where a servant slayeth his master,\u201d has always been construed to comprehend a servant who kills his mistress, or his master\u2019s wife \u00bf, <em>d fortiori, </em>in a remedial statute shall the term administrator include executor. If the 9th section of the act of 1715 was repealed by the act of 1784, the former was no bar to the plaintiff\u2019s action ; for the seven years had not elapsed, after the death of the defendant\u2019s testator, before the repeal took, place. 2d. But if the act of 1784 did not operate as a repeal, yet it is contended, that the act of 1789, c. 23 (Iredell\u2019s Digest, p. 676), clearly rejsealed the clause of limitation in the act of 1715. The 6th section enacts, \u201cthat *^a'w's an&lt;^ Parts laws that come within the purview and meaning of this act, are hereby declared void and of no effect.\u201d The only question upon this law is, whether the 9th section of the act of 1715 comes-within its purview and meaning ; and to show that it does, it is only necessary to read and compare the two acts together, <footnotemark><em>(a)</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b175-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>But the legislature of North Carolina passed a law in 1799 (c. 26), which \u2019declares, in substance, that notwithstanding the 6th section of the act of 1789, the 9th section of the act of 1715 was not repealed. This, however, \u25a0cannot affect the present case, for this action was ^brought in October 1798, before the law of 1799 was passed. But even if it had been brought after the law of 1790, that act could not alter the past law, and make that to have been law which was not law at the time. To declare what the law is, or has been, is a judicial power; to declare what the law shall be, is legislative. One of the fundamental principles of all onr governments is, that the legislative power shall be separated from the judicial.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b175-5\">The Coubt stopped the counsel, observing that it was unnecessary to argue that point.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b175-6\">The act of 1789, by making a provision on the same subject, differing from that of 1715, would have repealed it, without the express clause of repeal contained in the 6th section. Should it be said, that although the 9th section of the act of 1715 may be repealed, yet the present action is within the 4th section of the act of 1789, and barred thereby ; the answer is, that the defendant has not pleaded that act in bar, and the court will not notice a limitation unless pleaded.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b175-7\">2. The second inquiry involved in the general question is, whether, if the act of 1789 repealed the limitation of 1715, the latter had operated upon this case, before the repeal.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b175-8\">The defendant\u2019s testator died in 1780. The plaintiff\u2019s testator was a. British subject, and his right of action was suspended, not only by the act of assembly of North Carolina, passed in 1777, c. 2, \u00a7 101 (Iredell\u2019s Digest, p. 318), <footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark> but by the law of nations, which prohibits an alien enemy from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>maintaining ^action in- the courts of tbe nation with whom bis sovrigbt of action was not restored until tbe act any ereign is at war : and bis of assembly of 1787, c.' 1 (Iredell\u2019s Digest, p. 607), declared tbe treaty with Great Britain to be tbe law of tbe land, and directed tbe courts to decide accordingly, <footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b176-11\">By tbe 4th article of tbe definitive treaty of peace, creditors are to meet with no lawful impediment to tbe recovery of their debts. The limitation therefore, could not begin to run, before the removal of all such lawful impediments. Tbe treaty was ratified on tbe 14th of January 1784, and even calculating from that date, only five years bad elapsed before tbe repeal.</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b176-12\">It may be remarked also, that this same Samuel Cornell is one of tbe persons expressly named in tbe act of confiscation of October 1779, c. 2 (Iredell\u2019s Digest, p. 479), and therefore, it cannot be contended, that be was not one of tbe persons whose rights of action were suspended by tbe act of 1777s-c. 2. At tbe time of tbe repeal, tbe plaintiff was entitled to bring and maintain bis action. Ro right bad then vested in tbe defendant, under tbe act of limitations, and therefore, tbe principle does not apply, that tbe repeal shall not divest a right. *Acts of limitation do not absolve tbe debt; they only bar tbe remedy. <em>Quantock </em>v. <em>England, </em>5 Burr. 2628. They are nothing more than legal impediments. Tbe replication of tbe treaty was therefore, good.</p>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"b176-13\">March 6th, 1804.</decisiondate>\n<footnote data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b172-16\">A declaratory statute cannot have the legal effect of taking away a vested right, or of changing the rule of construction as to a preexisting law.
