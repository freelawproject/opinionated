Memorandum: Webelieve the surrogate erroneously granted the proponents\u2019 motion to limit the issues to be determined by the jury. <em>(Matter of Mackenzie, </em>272 N. Y. 403.) Chapter 613 of the Laws of 1937, which amended section 463 of the Civil Practice Act, was designed to effect a statutory change in the rule of the <em>Mackenzie Case (supra). </em>The statutory change thus made, however, applies only in the event a jury fails to agree upon a verdict, not to the situation with which this appeal is concerned where the decree reversed (253 App. Div. 120) was entered upon a jury\u2019s verdict. (See, also, <em>Matter of Gallo, </em>252 App. Div. 861, decided after the effective date of the statutory amendment mentioned above.) All concur. (The decree admits a will to probate.) Present \u2014 Sears, P. J., Crosby, Lewis, Taylor and Dowling, JJ.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
