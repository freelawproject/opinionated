Criminal Law Article, \u00a7 5-601. To possess that heroin with the intent to distribute it, however, escalates the crime into a felony with a maximum sentence of twenty years imprisonment. \u00a7\u00a7 5-602, 5-608. How then does the State go about proving that specific intent to distribute which is the escalating trigger? The defendant, of course, could tell us, but defendants are seldom so forthright. As an alternative, the State sometimes looks into the mind of the defendant inferentially, with the help of an expert witness. There is a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>discernible line, however, between what the expert is permitted to tell us and what he may not. The burden of this appeal is to determine on which side of that line the testimony of the State\u2019s expert fell.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-5\">The appellant, Keith S. Barkley, was convicted in the Circuit Court for Wicomico County by a jury, presided over by Judge W. Newton Jackson, III, of 1) possession with intent to distribute heroin; 2) the simple possession of heroin; and 3) the simple possession of cocaine. On appeal he raises two contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-6\">1. That Judge Jackson erroneously permitted a police detective, as an expert witness, to testify as to the appellant\u2019s state of mind; and</p>\n<p id=\"b162-7\">2. That Judge Jackson erroneously refused to allow him to discharge his attorney and to proceed <em>pro se.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b162-8\">Keeping Alleged Error In Perspective</p>\n<p id=\"b162-9\">To place the appellant\u2019s primary contention in perspective, we must ask, \u201cWhy would we, or why would anyone, care about the appellant\u2019s state of mind?\u201d It is a legitimate contention, but it does affect only one of the three charges for which the appellant was convicted. Even if the contention were to prevail, two of the appellant\u2019s three convictions would remain totally unscathed.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-10\">The hard core of basic facts in this case is not in dispute. On March 21, 2013, the appellant was arrested at the intersection of Lehigh Street and North Division Street in Salisbury. The legality of that warrantless arrest is not contested. In the presence of several other officers, Officer Brandon Cat\u00f3n of the Salisbury Police Department searched the appellant as an incident of the arrest. The Fourth Amendment reasonableness of that search incident is not contested. What that search revealed, moreover, is not factually contested.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-11\">Officer Cat\u00f3n recovered from the appellant\u2019s right front pocket 53 wax baggies containing a total weight of 10.7 grams of heroin. The 53 baggies were bundled together with a small rubber band. There was also recovered from the appellant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>person five twenty dollar bills, one ten dollar bill, one five dollar bill, and eight one dollar bills. From the appellant\u2019s left front pocket Officer Cat\u00f3n recovered a glass smoking device containing trace amounts of cocaine on the glass pipe.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-5\">The evidence of the appellant\u2019s basic guilt is not controverted. As the appellant stood there on that street corner in the presence of three officers, he was indisputably in unlawful possession of both heroin and cocaine. With respect to the charges of unlawful possession, moreover, the state of the appellant\u2019s mind was immaterial. Crimes of simple possession require only a general intent to possess. A specific intent (either to distribute or to do anything else) is not involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-6\">The appellant was convicted on three charges. He was convicted for the simple possession of cocaine. That conviction, and the four-year sentence imposed for it, will not be affected by whatever happens on the present contention. The appellant was also convicted for the simple possession of heroin. That conviction will also be unaffected by the present contention. For sentencing purposes, the conviction for that lesser included offense, of course, was merged into the conviction for the greater inclusive offense of possession of heroin with the intent to distribute. Should the sentence for the greater inclusive offense for any reason be vacated, however, the now merged conviction for simple possession would reemerge from its state of suspended animation and, on remand for resentencing, become the predicate for a sentence in its own right. We will go forward with the contention but with the awareness that it can affect only the conviction for the specific-intent crime of possessing heroin with the intent to distribute it.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-7\">Thinking About Thinking</p>\n<p id=\"b163-8\">The intent to distribute is, by definition, an element involving a defendant\u2019s <em>mens rea. </em>Frequently, however, the proof of that particular <em>mens rea, </em>to wit, that particular specific intent, is established by inference from the surrounding physical circumstances. What then were the surrounding physical circumstances in this case?</p>\n<p id=\"b164-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>Of the 53 baggies of heroin taken from the appellant\u2019s right front pocket, those that were tested by the crime laboratory showed that each contained trace amounts of heroin. The chemist testified that the term \u201ctrace amount\u201d refers to anything less than one-tenth of a gram. Trooper First Class Kenneth Moore of the Maryland State Police, who was accepted as an expert on street level identification, sales, packaging, and marketing of narcotic drugs for distribution, testified, without objection, that heroin on the street is \u201cnormally\u201d sold \u201cin those little packages in 100th of a gram.\u201d He testified, without objection, that what was in the bags recovered from the appellant was what \u201cyou normally purchase.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b164-5\">The cash recovered from the appellant included a $10 bill and five $20 bills. Trooper Moore testified, without objection, that a baggie of heroin \u201con average will cost you about $20 a fold.\u201d He testified, without objection, that \u201coftentimes\u201d drug dealers \u201cutilize 20s and 10s, smaller denominations, there\u2019s not change.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b164-6\">Trooper Moore also testified, without objection, as to the characteristic possessory behavior of a \u201ctypical user\u201d of drugs in contrast to the possessory habits of a distributor of drugs. With respect to a \u201ctypical user,\u201d he testified, without objection, \u201cMost of the time heroin addicts nowadays don\u2019t normally carry their heroin around with them ... oftentimes you don\u2019t find larger amounts of heroin with a person that is a user. They use what they get and most of the time that\u2019s a bag or two at a time.\u201d He further testified, again without objection, that when making a street level arrest of a \u201ctypical user,\u201d the police would find \u201cone to two bags\u201d in the arrestee\u2019s pocket but would not typically find \u201call that cash in that pocket after they purchased their heroin.\u201d Fact by fact by fact, the prosecution was loading the major premise into the syllogism.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-7\">The number of baggies of heroin found on the appellant was 53. Trooper Moore testified, without objection, that \u201ca bundle is what normally a middleman will buy as far as heroin. They are 13 bags.\u201d Four bundles of 13 baggies each would yield a product of 52 baggies, and the appellant had 53. Was there a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>miscount? Had 12 baggies already been sold from a fifth bundle? Or did one of the bundles come with an unexpected bonus? All this is grist for the jury mill! In any event, all of this testimony by Trooper Moore, unobjected to, dealt with general street level patterns and not with this appellant personally.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-5\">The stage was set. Having established the constituent elements without objection, the prosecutor put them all together for an omnibus conclusion. Although the question still meticulously referred not to the appellant personally but only to \u201can individual with this set of facts\u201d generically, the alarm went off on the defense side of the trial table.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b165-6\">[PROSECUTOR]: And combining all of this evidence, the fact that we don\u2019t have any needles or any way of using the heroin, the money in the pocket, the denominations, the number of bags, <em>are you able to form an expert opinion as to whether an individual with this set of facts </em>was engaged or possessing the heroin with the purpose of distributing it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b165-7\">[TROOPER MOORE]: What I\u2019ve heard today based on the amounts that were located, the manner of the bands, the lack of any type of device to utilize the heroin, it\u2019s pretty evident to me just based on my training and experience here in Wicomico County in recent weeks that <em>it was destined to be distributed </em>to persons here in Wicomico County.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b165-8\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Objection, Your Honor, move to strike.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b165-9\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b165-10\">At first it appeared that the court was ready to sustain the objection. If the question was not a question that was ultimately one for the jury, it was at least tantalizingly close.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b165-11\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Objection, Your Honor, move to strike.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b165-12\">THE COURT: Based on what?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b165-13\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Your Honor, that is a question for the jury, that is not a question for this expert.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b166-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>THE COURT: Which is what, the question?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b166-5\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Whether or not he possessed with the intent to distribute. That is the question for the jury.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b166-6\">THE COURT: That is an ultimate jury question so the witness\u2019s opinion is to be disregarded by the jury. Go ahead.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b166-7\">The prosecutor immediately threw out the life preserver of the critical distinction between the generic major premise that \u201cany person with this pattern of behavior would be distributing\u201d and the more suspect but unspoken minor premise that \u201cthe appellant with this pattern of behavior was distributing.\u201d It was, indeed, a fine line, but a dispositive one.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b166-8\">[PROSECUTOR]: I believe if I could clarify for the record, Your Honor, the witness\u2019s testimony was <em>whether this particular fact pattern would be indicative of an individual whose intent was to distribute heroin, he was not testifying as to the Defendant\u2019s particular mindset.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b166-9\">THE COURT: As <em>an individual in general as opposed to this particular Defendant?</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b166-10\">[PROSECUTOR]: <em>Correct.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b166-11\">THE COURT: All right, with that understanding the objection is overruled.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b166-12\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b166-13\">This all may be a tempest in a teapot. The factual premises had all been established without objection. Trooper Moore had laid out the characteristic behavior of a distributor as contrasted to the more innocuous behavior of a mere user. The jury was readily capable, without spoonfeeding, of completing the syllogism for itself. The obvious syllogism before the jury was, stating it simplistically:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b166-14\">All persons who exhibited such behavior probably intended to distribute.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b166-15\">The appellant is a person who exhibited such behavior. ERGO: The appellant probably intended to distribute.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b167-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>The conclusion is as obvious as it is valid. Even without benefit of formal terminology, that is the way the human mind works. Less pedantically, the jury verdict may simply have been the drawing of an irresistible inference. \u201cIf it looks like a duck and walks like a duck and quacks like a duck, it\u2019s a duck.\u201d It is a classic inference. It is permissible, it is irresistible, and it is obvious. We are persuaded beyond all reasonable doubt, therefore, that the jurors would have drawn this inference, or would validly have reached this conclusion, for themselves even if no one else, from the witness stand or in closing argument, had articulated it for them. As this Court observed in <em>Cirincione v. State, </em>75 Md.App. 166, 181-82, 540 A.2d 1151 (1988):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b167-4\">In terms of its helpfulness to the jury, we find the distinction between an opinion as to a predicate fact that inevitably yields the ultimate fact and an opinion as to the ultimate fact itself to be a distinction without a difference. We will not hypothesize a jury so dense that it would be helped by the latter opinion but would be left adrift by the former.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b167-5\">We will not, however, leap forward to an alternative holding of hypothetical harmless error on this contention because we adamantly believe that there was no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-6\">Expert Opinions and Ultimate Issues</p>\n<p id=\"b167-7\">Our bottom-line decision that Judge Jackson was not in error in overruling the appellant\u2019s objection to Trooper Moore\u2019s testimony is easy. Explaining how we get to that decision is another matter entirely. Involved is the incredibly dense subject of expert opinions and ultimate issues. At the most fundamental level, the problem is that the law has been attempting, with only limited success, to create a general rule to cover a broad congeries of situations that defy generalization.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-8\">Under the pre-1994 regime of Maryland\u2019s common law of evidence, the rule had almost accidentally or haphazardly emerged that an expert witness could not give an opinion on an issue that was an ultimate issue for decision by a jury. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number><em>Bentley, Shriver &amp; Co. v. Edwards, 100 Md. 652, 665, 60 </em>A. 283 (1905); <em>McClees v. Cohen, </em>158 Md. 60, 68, 148 A. 124 (1930). The notion was that the expert should not be permitted to invade the province of the jury. The problem with the rule was that frequently it did not work. There arose so many <em>ad hoc </em>exceptions and modifications to the rule that the end product was chaotic. In 6 Lynn McLain, <em>Maryland Evidence, </em>\u00a7 704:1 at 971-72 (3d ed.2013), Professor McLain describes the pre-1994 pandemonium:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b168-5\"><em>The common law decisions, </em>in excluding certain unhelpful, superfluous opinion testimony, often <em>justified their rulings by stating that opinions on the ultimate issue to be decided by the jury in a case were inadmissible. This approach led to the creation of artificial distinctions and exceptions, where circumvention of the \u201crule\u201d </em>of inadmissibility of opinions on ultimate issues <em>was necessary, for </em>example, with regard to opinions regarding mental capacity and sanity, permanent disability, and forgery.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b168-6\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b168-7\">When the Court of Appeals adopted the Maryland Rules of Evidence in 1994, it included Maryland Rule 5-704(a), which is identical to Federal Rule of Evidence 704(a). It provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"APN\">(a) In General. Except as provided in section (b) of this Rule, testimony in the form of an opinion or inference otherwise admissible is not objectionable merely because it embraces an ultimate issue to be decided by the trier of fact.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b168-8\">The new rule effectively abrogated the former prohibition. Professor McLain, \u00a7 704:l(b) at 973, both described and commended the change:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b168-9\">Modern Maryland case law, codified in <em>Md. Rule 5-70U(a), more wisely states that the fact that a witness\u2019s opinion addresses an ultimate issue </em>as to which the judge or jury must reach a conclusion <em>does not preclude </em>automatically <em>the witness\u2019s testifying to it. </em>Rather, <em>the question, </em>as with regard to any opinion testimony, <em>will be whether the witness\u2019s opinion is rationally based and would be helpful </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number><em>to the fact-finder. If both criteria are met, the opinion will be admissible </em>under Md. Rule 5-701 as to a lay witness and under Md. Rule 5-702 as to an expert witness.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b169-5\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b169-6\">The exception to that amelioration is subsection (b). The exception applies to criminal cases only. Rule 5-704(b) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b169-7\">(b) Opinion on Mental State or Condition. <em>An expert witness </em>testifying with respect to the mental state or condition of a defendant in a criminal case <em>may not state an opinion </em>or inference <em>as to whether the defendant had a mental state or condition constituting an element of the crime </em>charged. That issue is for the trier of fact alone. This exception does not apply to an ultimate issue of criminal responsibility.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b169-8\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b169-9\">The final sentence makes it clear that the prohibition of the earlier limitation on expert opinions does not apply to cases raising the issue of insanity or other aspects of criminal responsibility. The thing that is still prohibited is \u201can opinion ... as to whether the defendant had a mental state or condition constituting an element of the crime charged.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b169-10\">It is on Rule 5-704(b) that the appellant exclusively relies. He charges that the court erroneously received in evidence \u201can expert\u2019s opinion that Appellant possessed the heroin with the intent to distribute.\u201d One of the issues, of course, is that of whether the expert ever actually expressed an opinion that the appellant possessed an intent to distribute. The appellant does, in that regard, acknowledge a chink in his armor. He does not assert (on the facts of this case, he could not) that the expert opinion ever explicitly called him out by name or ever expressly stated that this appellant personally had an intent to distribute. He accused the expert opinion, more obliquely, of supplying the predicate from which an inference of the appellant\u2019s intent to distribute would necessarily be drawn. The appellant\u2019s argument is:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b170-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>The prosecutor cannot shield that this question was directed at Appellant\u2019s state of mind by proffering that the question was \u201cwhether this particular fact pattern would be indicative of an individual whose intent was to distribute heroin\u201d rather than focusing on the specific intent of Appellant. Simply put, <em>there was no other individual discussed during trial \u201cwith this set of facts.\u201d </em>The State alleged at trial only that Appellant was involved in \u201cthis particular fact pattern.\u201d <em>While the State attempted to disguise the question in the form of a hypothetical, the question was directed at the facts of this case and this case dealt only with Appellant. The State effectively inquired and received testimony about Appellant\u2019s mental state. </em>This testimony crossed this line and should have been excluded.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b170-5\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b170-6\">The appellant\u2019s drop-back position necessarily is that the expert\u2019s suggesting his intent to distribute indirectly as part of a two-step process is tantamount to ascribing that intent to distribute to him directly as part of a one-step process. The argument is that if the appellant is the only person on trial, everything in the State\u2019s case is necessarily about him. He claims that the expert opinion rule protects him from ricochets as well as from direct hits. As we turn to the caselaw interpreting Rule 5 \u2014 704(b), that is precisely the issue we must decide.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-7\">\n<em>Gauvin v. State</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b170-8\">For better or for worse, the appellant relies on <em>Gauvin v. State, </em>411 Md. 698, 985 A.2d 513 (2009). So, indeed, does the State. In <em>Gauvin </em>the critical conviction was for the possession of phencyclidine (PCP) with the intent to distribute. The defendant\u2019s actual possession of the PCP was not disputed. The key issue in the <em>Gauvin </em>case, as in this case, concerned the State\u2019s proof of the specific intent to distribute. The defendant\u2019s contention was that the court \u201cpermitted an expert witness to state an opinion that the defendant/appellant possessed PCP with an intent to distribute.\u201d 411 Md. at 700, 985 A.2d 513. The defendant\u2019s argument was that the ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>pert\u2019s testimony was a forbidden opinion about his \u201cmental state or condition constituting an element of the crime charged\u201d in direct contravention of Rule 5 \u2014 704(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b171-4\">Although Judge Murphy\u2019s opinion for the Court of Appeals affirmed the conviction and held that \u201cthe testimony at issue did not violate Rule 5-704(b),\u201d 411 Md. at 700, 985 A.2d 513, it did, in passing, give the appellant here a small moral victory, around which he now builds his entire argument. The <em>Gauvin </em>opinion observed that the question put to the expert by the prosecuting attorney did violate Rule 5-704(b), although, more significantly, the ultimate answer given by the expert did not. The offending question was:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b171-5\">[D]o you have the ability to form an opinion as to whether or not <em>the PCP that was seized from Ms. Gauvin </em>on December 15, 2006 <em>was for her personal consumption or for distribution?</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b171-6\">411 Md. at 701-02, 985 A.2d 513 (emphasis supplied). With respect to that question itself, the Court of Appeals was firm in its disapproval.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b171-7\">In the case at bar, it is clear that the prosecutor\u2019s question \u2014 \u201cwhether or not <em>the PCP that was seized from [Appellant] was for her personal consumption or for distribution? </em>\u201d \u2014 sought an opinion that is prohibited by MRE 5-704(b). The Circuit Court should have sustained the objection to this question on the ground that <em>no expert is entitled to express the opinion that the defendant possessed a controlled dangerous substance with the intent to distribute it.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"AFt\">411 Md. at 710-11, 985 A.2d 513 (emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b171-8\">In redeeming contrast to the offending question, however, the less personally focused response of the expert witness was based on neutral physical circumstances.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b171-9\"><em>[T]he amount would indicate to me </em>that it was possessed with intent to distribute. I would base that on different factors.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b171-10\">411 Md. at 702, 985 A.2d 513 (emphasis supplied). The expert went on immediately to explain that \u201ca \u2018hand-rolled\u2019 cigarette is commonly used to ingest PCP\u201d and that \u201cthe 18 doses of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>PCP seized from the vehicle \u2018is kind of [an] unusually large amount for just a user to be driving around with in a vehicle.\u2019 \u201d He proceeded to detail his analysis of the tangible evidence.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b172-5\">This is \u2014 in my opinion \u2014 again, based on just, you know, the 18 doses average of what you would use a cigarette for, <em>the going rate going 15 to 20 dollars per </em>dipper or a <em>cigarette </em>laced or saturated with phencyclidine, the money that was also recovered, <em>the $250 was all in twenties. There is obviously liquid missing from these vials. </em>So <em>that would indicate to me that some of it had already been distributed. </em>It\u2019s not uncommon for <em>people </em>\u2014 the <em>gloves also help add to that opinion </em>because users and people that handle PCP are aware that it is transdermal, that it is absorbed through the skin. Also people that \u2014 it\u2019s common also even amongst crack dealers where it\u2019s not transdermal where they say they don\u2019t leave fingerprints on any of the things that they have handled. So it serves kind of a dual purpose when you see the rubber gloves there.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b172-6\"><em>Id. </em>(emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b172-7\">Judge Murphy explained that the expert witness never \u201ccrossed the line\u201d established by Rule 5-704(b) and that his opinion was, therefore, admissible.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b172-8\">Sgt. McDonough, however, <em>never expressed an opinion that \u201ccrossed the line\u201d established by MRE 5-70](b). ... </em>Sgt. McDonough <em>\u201cnever directly and unequivocally testified to [Appellant\u2019s] mental state; </em>he <em>never stated directly that [Appellant] had the intent to distribute. \u201d </em>... Sgt. McDon-ough\u2019s <em>opinion was based upon his \u201cknowledge of common practices in the drug trade, rather than on some special familiarity with the workings of [Appellant\u2019s] mind.\u201d </em>No unfair prejudice occurs when an erroneous evidentiary ruling results in the introduction of admissible evidence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b172-10\">411 Md. at 711, 985 A.2d 513 (emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b172-11\">The Court of Appeals made it clear, moreover, that it is the actual opinion rendered by the expert and not the antecedent question that is controlling in a Rule 5-704(b) analysis.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b173-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number><em>[AJlthough the prosecutor\u2019s question \u201cstrayed from the track\u201d </em>established by MRE 5 \u2014 704(b), <em>Sgt. McDonough\u2019s \u201canswer did not. </em>\u201d Under these circumstances, Appellant is not entitled to a new trial on the ground that Sgt. McDon-ough expressed an opinion that should have been excluded under Md. Rule 5-704(b).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b173-4\">411 Md. at 713, 985 A.2d 513 (emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b173-5\">Before turning our attention to the quality of the expert opinion given by the expert in <em>Gauvin, </em>it behooves us to note that the affirmance of the conviction in the case now before us does not depend on Gauvin\u2019s distinction between the question and the answer. In <em>Gauvin </em>the offending question focused in very personally on \u201cthe PCP that was seized from <em>Ms. Gau-vin </em>\u201d and asked whether the expert thought it was <em>\u201cfor her personal consumption </em>or for distribution.\u201d 411 Md. at 701-02, 985 A.2d 513 (emphasis supplied). In the present case, by contrast, the question, after listing the physical factors developed by the police, sought an opinion about \u201cwhether an individual with this set of facts\u201d would have \u201cthe purpose of distributing?\u201d \u201cAn individual with this set of facts\u201d could be anybody. The question was appropriately generic.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-6\">With respect to the expert opinion, the <em>Gauvin </em>opinion focused on</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b173-7\">the critical distinction between (1) an explicitly stated opinion that the criminal defendant had a particular mental state, and (2) an explanation of why an item of evidence is consistent with a particular mental state.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b173-8\">411 Md. at 708, 985 A.2d 513.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-9\">An admissible expert opinion may come close to a defendant\u2019s state of mind or specific intent and may strongly suggest the answer to that ultimate issue but it stays deftly one step back from the ultimate answer. It brings to mind the classical philosophical problem of how progressively closer one can approach toward a point without getting there. Unlike in horseshoes, close does not count. <em>Gauvin </em>quoted with approval from Christopher B. Mueller &amp; Laird C. Kirkpatrick, <em>Evidence, </em>\u00a7 7.13 at 670 (4th ed.2009):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b174-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number><em>Expert testimony at one remove from such ultimate issues as intent may be admitted even though it indirectly supports a conclusion or suggests an inference on some ultimate issue. Thus testimony </em>describing typical patterns of organized crimes or conspiracies <em>does not violate FRE 70Jp(b) even though it provides evidence </em>that persuades a jury, in light of what defendant and others are shown to have done, <em>that the requisite intent existed.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b174-5\">411 Md. at 708, 985 A.2d 513 (emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b174-6\"><em>Gauvin </em>relied heavily on the two federal cases of <em>United States v. Lipscomb, </em>14 F.3d 1236 (7th Cir.1994), and <em>United States v. Gonzales, </em>307 F.3d 906 (9th Cir.2002). In <em>Lipscomb, </em>three law enforcement officers offered expert opinions that the cocaine seized from the defendant\u2019s person was \u201cfor street level distribution.\u201d The Seventh Circuit, 14 F.3d at 1242-43, explained why such expert opinion did not run afoul of Federal Rule of Evidence 704(b).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b174-7\">[W]e conclude that when a law enforcement official states an opinion about the criminal nature of a defendant\u2019s activities, <em>such testimony should not be excluded </em>under Rule 704(b) as <em>long as it is made clear, </em>either by the court expressly or in the nature of the examination, <em>that the opinion is based on the expert\u2019s knowledge of common criminal practices, and not on some special knowledge of the defendant\u2019s mental processes. </em>Relevant in this regard, though not determinative, is the degree to which the expert refers specifically to the \u201cintent\u201d of the defendant, ... for this may indeed suggest, improperly, that the opinion is based on some special knowledge of the defendant\u2019s mental processes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b174-8\">In this case, <em>each of the challenged opinions was immediately followed by a precise explanation of the grounds for the opinion, </em>and <em>the grounds cited made it clear that the officers were relying on their knowledge of common practices in the drug trade, rather than on some special familiarity with the workings of Lipscomb\u2019s mind.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b174-9\">411 Md. at 708-09, 985 A.2d 513 (emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b174-10\">In the <em>Gonzales </em>case, also relied on by <em>Gauvin, </em>the critical issue was proof of the specific intent to distribute narcotics. A <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>DEA agent, qualified as an expert in drug distribution and possession, \u201cwas asked whether the particular amount of drugs found on a person indicated whether such an individual possessed the drugs for personal use or for distribution.\u201d 307 F.3d at 911. The defendant\u2019s claim on appeal was indistinguishable from the one now before us.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b175-4\">On appeal, Gonzales argues that the district court erred in admitting Heald\u2019s expert testimony because it consisted of an opinion about Gonzalez\u2019s mental state, in violation of Rule 704(b) of the Federal Rules of Evidence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b175-5\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b175-6\">The <em>Gonzales </em>opinion, quoted with approval by <em>Gauvin, </em>411 Md. at 710, 985 A.2d 513, held that the expert\u2019s opinion, albeit making the conclusion that Gonzales had the intent to distribute almost inevitable, did not cross the fine line between an express assertion and providing the basis for an inference.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b175-7\"><em>Heald never directly and unequivocally testified to Gonzalez\u2019s mental state; he never stated directly that Gonzales had the intent to distribute. </em>Rather, <em>he indicated </em>his firm conviction <em>that a \u201cperson\u201d possessing the evidence in question would, in fact, possess the drugs for the purpose of distributing.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b175-8\">307 F.3d at 911 (emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b175-9\">This Court in <em>Pringle v.

The conviction was for the possession of cocaine with the intent to distribute. Detective Frank Masso-ni was accepted as an expert in controlled substances. He testified that the drugs in that case \u201cwere intended to be distributed.\u201d 141 Md.App. at 299, 785 A.2d 790.

The question itself summed up four undisputed physical circumstances and then asked whether any \u201cindividual with this set of facts\u201d would intend to distribute. Trooper Moore did not even know the appellant and had no special knowledge about the appellant\u2019s mind. His opinion was based exclusively on \u201c[wjhat I\u2019ve heard today based on the amounts that were located, the manner of the bands, the lack of any type of device to utilize the heroin.\u201d His expert opinion did not offend Rule 5 \u2014 704(b). The appellant\u2019s state of mind could be inferred from the circumstances themselves, as ultimately it was.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-11\">Discharging Counsel in Mid-Trial</p>\n<p id=\"b177-12\">The second contention concerns the appellant\u2019s effort to discharge his counsel. The trial took place on September 9, 2013. The appellant was represented by an assistant public <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>defender. Following the swearing in of the jury and opening statements by the prosecution and defense, the State proceeded to present its case-in-chief. Two State\u2019s witnesses were examined, cross-examined, and excused. The third witness was Officer Brandon Cat\u00f3n of the Salisbury Police Department. Following direct examination by the prosecution, the assistant public defender began her cross-examination. In the course of that cross-examination, counsel informed the court that a serious dispute had arisen between her and the appellant with respect to her conduct of the cross-examination.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b178-5\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Your Honor, <em>my client is having an issue with the questions that I\u2019m asking the witnesses. He believes that I\u2019m not asking questions that he wants asked. </em>I\u2019m exercising my discretion in asking these questions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b178-6\">[THE DEFENDANT]: Your Honor, what it is\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b178-7\">THE COURT: You want her to be your lawyer?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b178-8\">THE DEFENDANT: What it is\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b178-9\">THE COURT: Well, let me ask you a question. Are you a lawyer?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b178-10\">THE DEFENDANT: Huh?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b178-11\">THE COURT: Are you a lawyer?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b178-12\">THE DEFENDANT: No. I know enough about my case and the law and what went on that what ain\u2019t being established in this case right now.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b178-13\">THE COURT: Well, <em>you have a right to testify if you want. You can testify later.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b178-14\">THE DEFENDANT: I know I can testify but <em>she has evidence </em>like awhile ago he came and stopped me but <em>this cop told her he did not offer testimony </em>that he knew.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b178-15\">THE COURT: I don\u2019t know\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b178-16\">THE DEFENDANT: <em>That he did not know anything.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b178-17\">THE COURT: You have an attorney representing you. The attorney is the person to ask questions and to make oral argument and to make legal argument.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b178-18\">THE DEFENDANT: I made that argument awhile ago.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b179-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>THE COURT: <em>So you have the right to talk to your attorney </em>and I would suggest you whisper to her so the jury doesn\u2019t hear what you\u2019re saying.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b179-5\">THE DEFENDANT: <em>I did but she didn\u2019t agree with me.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b179-6\">THE COURT: So just deal or talk to your own attorney. You can\u2019t come up here and tell me.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b179-7\">(Emphasis supplied). Our quotation in full of the colloquy between the appellant and the trial judge is not without significance, as will be more fully discussed <em>infra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b179-8\">At that point the appellant indicated that he wanted to discharge his assigned counsel for the specific reason that she was not asking the questions that the appellant wanted to be asked. Judge Jackson warned him that if he discharged his lawyer he would be left to represent himself.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b179-9\">THE DEFENDANT: But I\u2019m saying <em>I did not want to go ahead with this trial.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b179-10\">THE COURT: You want to <em>fire </em>\u2014 you <em>want to discharge your attorney?</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b179-11\">THE DEFENDANT: <em>Because she\u2019s not asking the questions that are supposed to be asked. </em>She has a witness go off the stand who was perjuring.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b179-12\">THE COURT: Listen to me, Mr. Barkley. <em>You have a right to represent yourself if you want. You can discharge [defense counsel], but then you\u2019re on your own, you\u2019re representing yourself. I don\u2019t think you want to do </em>that. You want to be your own lawyer? <em>I don\u2019t think you want to be your own lawyer.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b179-13\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b179-14\">The appellant persisted that he wanted to represent himself so that he could recall the State\u2019s witnesses who had already testified and ask questions of them that he thought should have been but were not originally asked.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b179-15\">THE DEFENDANT: <em>I need to recall them back again </em>to establish\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b179-16\">THE COURT: You have a lawyer. He doesn\u2019t want to fire his attorney. Go back to the trial table.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b180-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>THE DEFENDANT: No, I\u2019m saying <em>I want to represent myself to recall them.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b180-5\">THE COURT: <em>We\u2019re not going to recall any witnesses.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b180-6\">THE DEFENDANT: <em>Because she didn\u2019t establish that he lied to her in this courtroom. He said on July 12th that he didn\u2019t remember anything, but said yet he testified and told a lie.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b180-7\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b180-8\">Judge Jackson then directed the jury to retire to the jury room. Officer Cat\u00f3n was excused from the stand and told to wait in the hall. Judge Jackson then invited the appellant to explain fully his basis for his dissatisfaction with counsel. The gist of the appellant\u2019s complaint was that a policeman had lied on the stand, but that his attorney had failed to expose the falsity.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b180-9\">THE COURT: <em>Now that the jury has left the courtroom, </em>they are in the jury room, <em>tell me what it is you want to say, Mr. Barkley.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b180-10\">THE DEFENDANT: <em>She advised me that Lieutenant King on July the 12th told her </em>when asked what did he hear, what did you remember hearing on the thing, he said <em>he don\u2019t remember anything. And he\u2019s coming here today, and he just testified </em>on that stand <em>that he heard me say $20, which I know I didn\u2019t say, </em>that\u2019s all a lie. <em>Every officer that took that stand is telling a bald-faced lie </em>and the only way to prove anything if they had recorded it. They didn\u2019t record anything, because none of that happened. Nothing like they\u2019re saying. And I\u2019ll take a polygraph and you make them take a polygraph because it\u2019s just a lie. You know they in here telling a bald-faced lie in everything that just happened. <em>Everything they are saying is a lie. </em>And how you going to prove it because they didn\u2019t tape it, when they had it in their power to tape the conversation. <em>They\u2019re lying.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b180-11\">THE COURT: All right you have an attorney. <em>You have an experienced attorney. You have an Assistant Public Defender who I have recognized or have had before me </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number><em>many times and I recognize her to be a very capable criminal defense attorney. </em>You on the other hand told me you have not been to law school, you are not a lawyer, I assume you are not trained in the law in any way. You have a good attorney. <em>Are you telling me you wish to fire your attorney ?</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-4\">THE DEFENDANT: I\u2019m saying, Your Honor, right now releasing them witnesses from the witness stand\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-5\">THE COURT: <em>That\u2019s not what I\u2019m asking you.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-6\">THE DEFENDANT: \u2014 without questioning the proper questions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-7\">THE COURT: That\u2019s not what I\u2019m asking.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-8\">THE DEFENDANT: <em>Then yes.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-9\">THE COURT: <em>And you understand those witnesses cannot be recalled. They are not going to come back and testify. You\u2019ve also sat next to your attorney, you could have whispered in her ear.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-10\">THE DEFENDANT: <em>I did tell her, but you excused the witness off the stand.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-11\">THE COURT: Well, maybe she knows what\u2019s better for you than you do. Maybe she knows what to ask.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-12\">THE DEFENDANT: <em>How is that better when he lied? </em>He lied on the stand. You\u2019re not going to establish the fact that he lied and when she know it and the State\u2019s Attorney go up there and you not allow it in. How is that being fair?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-13\">THE COURT: There\u2019s no need for you to argue to me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-14\">THE DEFENDANT: That\u2019s not being fair.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-15\">THE COURT: There\u2019s no need to argue with me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-16\">THE DEFENDANT: <em>You\u2019re saying I can\u2019t recall a witness back to establish that fact?</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b181-17\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b181-18\">Although the appellant persisted in wishing to discharge counsel, it also became clear that the reason for the requested discharge was so the appellant himself could then recall the witnesses and also so that he could call the assistant public defender as a defense witness. Judge Jackson admonished <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>him that, even if he represented himself, he could do neither. Those purely anticipatory rulings, we hasten to point out, are not an appellate contention in this case. Their hypothetical merit or demerit is not an issue before us.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b182-5\">THE COURT: <em>Right now you have an attorney. My recommendation is that you keep that attorney; </em>however, <em>if you wish to discharge your attorney I\u2019ll consider your request. Tell me what you want to do.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b182-6\">THE DEFENDANT: <em>I want to discharge her.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b182-7\">THE COURT: <em>You want to discharge her. And that means you understand you mil be alone sitting by yourself at the trial table.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b182-8\">THE DEFENDANT: <em>Yes, and I want to take and recall.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b182-9\">THE COURT: <em>No, you cannot recall the witnesses, they\u2019ve already testified.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b182-10\">THE DEFENDANT: <em>Why can\u2019t I rebut and call them </em>in to re ask them and reestablish? If she have to take the witness stand, I can go from here and then have her to say what the officer said. I can take over and call her as a witness because she stated it to me. I can do that, can\u2019t I?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b182-11\">THE COURT: Call whom as a witness?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b182-12\">THE DEFENDANT: [Defense counsel],</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b182-13\">THE COURT: <em>Your attorney cannot testify.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b182-14\">THE DEFENDANT: <em>Why can\u2019t she? </em>She heard what he said on July 12th to know that he told a lie on this witness stand. That he perjured, that\u2019s definitely something for the jury to hear. He perjured on the witness stand. He perjured. Officer Sigmund perjured.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b182-15\">THE COURT: Well, you also know, and <em>I told you this earlier at the bench. You\u2019re not required to testify. </em>If you don\u2019t testify I\u2019m going to tell the jury that they cannot assume you\u2019re guilty and that you have an absolute constitutional right not to testify and you\u2019re presumed innocent. <em>But you also have the right to testify.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b182-16\">THE DEFENDANT: <em>I am testifying.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b183-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>THE COURT: <em>Well, you also need to talk to your attorney before you do that </em>because the State can impeach you with evidence of convictions of other crimes, too.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b183-5\">THE DEFENDANT: I\u2019m aware of that, which <em>a motion in limine should have been filed in that case, but it wasn\u2019t. </em>(Emphasis supplied).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b183-6\">Having heard enough to understand fully the appellant\u2019s position, Judge Jackson noted that the State still had two expert witnesses to call and that the appellant was almost certainly incompetent to cross-examine an expert witness. The appellant\u2019s tentative flirtation with representing himself, moreover, was expressly for the alternative purposes of 1) recalling witnesses to the stand and 2) \u201cshutting down\u201d the jury trial then in progress, postponing the case, and subsequently going forward with a \u201cbench trial.\u201d Judge Jackson firmly informed him that neither one of those procedures would be permitted. The court\u2019s final decision was that the trial would go forward, the discharge of counsel would not be permitted, and the assistant public defender would continue to represent the appellant.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b183-7\">THE COURT: We still have a lot to do in this trial, there are more witnesses to call from the State\u2019s point of view, including two expert witnesses. <em>I doubt very seriously you know how to cross-examine an expert witness. </em>Maybe you do, I don\u2019t know. <em>I strongly urge you to retain [Defense Counsel] as your lawyer, </em>but it\u2019s your choice. The trial will continue right now from this point forward. <em>You will not recall any other witnesses. </em>So tell me what you want to do.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b183-8\">THE DEFENDANT: So you\u2019re not going to let me be able to establish it, <em>so I can\u2019t call her to the witness stand?</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b183-9\">THE COURT: <em>That creates a lot of problems and the answer is no, </em>you cannot call your own criminal defense attorney to the witness stand. She was not present at the events.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b183-10\">THE DEFENDANT: She was present for what he stated to her on July 12th during the hearing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b183-11\">THE COURT: So the answer is no.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b184-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>THE DEFENDANT: He perjured on the stand today by what was being established.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b184-4\">THE COURT: Mr. Barkley, you\u2019re not answering\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b184-5\">THE DEFENDANT: <em>Okay. Then what if I say okay, I just shut down the jury thing today and I want to postpone and then go ahead and have a bench trial.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b184-6\">THE COURT: Well, <em>it\u2019s not going to be postponed. We\u2019re not going to postpone your trial, you\u2019ve started with a jury trial. </em>If you want to excuse the jury now and have a bench trial, we\u2019ll continue forward because I\u2019ve heard the witnesses. <em>There\u2019s no need to start over.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b184-7\">THE DEFENDANT: <em>And still I can\u2019t start over?</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b184-8\">THE COURT: <em>No.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b184-9\">THE DEFENDANT: So I can\u2019t establish the fact of what he said. You\u2019re not going to allow the establishment to show that he perjured.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b184-10\">THE COURT: <em>From what Fm hearing you don\u2019t want to discharge [Defense Counsel] so she will continue in the case as your attorney. Bring back in the jury.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b184-11\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b184-12\">The trial then proceeded with no further snags or signs of discord between the appellant and his attorney. The assistant public defender competently cross-examined the State\u2019s expert witnesses, appropriately moved for a judgment of acquittal, and ably delivered a closing argument to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-13\">\u201cMeaningful Trial Proceedings\u201d Had Begun</p>\n<p id=\"b184-14\">This is not a case involving the \u201cprecise rubric\u201d of Maryland Rule 4-215(e). That Rule\u2019s prescribed rigid drill for considering the requested discharge of counsel only applies pretrial. Once meaningful trial proceedings have commenced, the decision of whether to permit the discharge of counsel is entrusted to the discretion of the trial judge. In <em>State v. Brown, </em>342 Md. 404, 426, 676 A.2d 513 (1996), the Court of Appeals was unequivocal.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b184-15\"><em>[T]he right to substitute counsel and the right to self-representation are, </em>of necessity, <em>curtailed once trial begins. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number><em>After meaningful trial proceedings have commenced, the decision </em>to permit the defendant to exercise either right <em>must be committed to the sound discretion of the trial court. Once trial begins, </em>therefore, <em>Rule Jp-215 no longer governs, </em>although the court must still adhere to constitutional standards.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b185-5\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b185-6\">That holding was reaffirmed by <em>State v. Campbell, </em>385 Md. 616, 632, 870 A.2d 217 (2005).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b185-7\">Our focus now must shift to the logistical requirements imposed upon a request to discharge counsel. We have held that <em>a defendant\u2019s right to waive counsel and proceed pro se or to substitute counsel is more limited once \u201cmeaningful trial proceedings\u201d have begun, </em>because <em>the mandatory nature of Rule Jp-215(e) is inapplicable, </em>and the \u201cdecision to permit discharge of counsel after trial has begun is within the sound discretion of the trial court.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b185-8\">(Emphasis supplied). See also <em>State v. Hardy, </em>415 Md. 612, 624, 4 A.3d 908 (2010) (\u201cRule 4-215(e) ceases to apply as soon as \u2018meaningful trial proceedings\u2019 begin.\u201d). The Sixth Amendment right to represent oneself per <em>Faretta v. California, </em>422 U.S. 806, 95 S.Ct. 2525, 45 L.Ed.2d 562 (1975), is not nearly so unforgiving as Maryland Rule 4-215(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b185-9\">In <em>Campbell, </em>385 Md. at 634, 870 A.2d 217, it was held that meaningful trial proceedings had begun when the request to discharge counsel came at the close of the State\u2019s case-in-chief.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b185-10\">In the present case, <em>Campbell made a request to discharge counsel at the close of the State\u2019s case-in-chief </em>and after defense counsel had announced that Campbell had elected to remain silent. We find that <em>\u201cmeaningful trial proceedings\u201d definitely had begun, </em>rendering Rule 4-215(e) inapplicable.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b185-11\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b185-12\">The request to discharge counsel came at a significantly earlier juncture in <em>State v. Brown, </em>342 Md. at 410, 676 A.2d 513, where it was made \u201c[bjefore the State completed the direct examination of the first witness.\u201d It was nonetheless <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>held that meaningful trial proceedings had begun. In <em>State v. Hardy, </em>415 Md. at 627, 4 A.3d 908, meaningful trial proceedings were deemed to have begun even during the course of, but prior to the completion of, the voir dire examination of prospective jurors.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b186-5\">Two considerations inform our conclusion that the proper resolution of this issue is that <em>\u201cmeaningful trial proceedings\u201d have begun when a request to discharge counsel is made during voir dire. </em>First, voir dire is a \u201cmeaningful trial proceeding\u201d under the plain meaning of the phrase....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b186-6\">Second, <em>voir dire is a \u201cmeaningful trial proceeding\u201d </em>under the functional definition of the phrase.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b186-7\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b186-8\">By those lights, the request to discharge counsel in this case, first arising during the cross-examination of the third State\u2019s witness and deeper into the trial than had been the case in either <em>State v. Brown </em>or <em>State v. Hardy, </em>clearly came after meaningful trial proceedings had begun.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-9\">The Standard of Review Is the Abuse of Discretion</p>\n<p id=\"b186-10\">In relaxed contrast to the regime of Rule 4-215, where even substantial compliance will not pass muster, the decision of whether to permit the discharge of counsel once meaningful trial proceedings have begun is comfortably entrusted to the broad discretion of the trial judge. As Judge Raker stated in <em>State v. Brown, </em>342 Md. at 420, 676 A.2d 513:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b186-11\">We agree with the conclusion reached by the Court of Special Appeals in <em>Ross </em>and in <em>Johnson, </em>that <em>the decision to permit discharge of counsel </em>after trial has begun <em>is within the sound discretion of the trial court.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b186-12\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b186-13\">Judge Harrell in <em>State v. Hardy, </em>415 Md. at 621-22, 4 A.3d 908, was emphatic about the breadth and flexibility permitted under a discretionary ruling:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b186-14\">Where a motion to discharge counsel is made during trial, however, Rule 4-215(e) does not apply, and <em>we evaluate the trial court\u2019s ruling </em>on a motion to discharge counsel <em>under </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number><em>the far more lenient abuse of discretion standard. </em>We have noted that <em>a court abuses its discretion </em>in this regard <em>only when it acts \u201cwithout reference to any guiding rules or principles, \u201d </em>and that <em>we find an abuse of discretion only when the court\u2019s act is so untenable as to place it \u201cbeyond the fringe of what the court deems minimally acceptable. \u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b187-5\">(Emphasis supplied). See also <em>State v. Campbell, </em>385 Md. at 632, 870 A.2d 217 (\u201c[T]he decision to permit discharge of counsel after trial has begun is within the sound discretion of the trial court.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b187-6\">Providing the Appellant a Forum</p>\n<p id=\"b187-7\">Although the caselaw universally holds that the ultimate decision of whether to permit the discharge of counsel is entrusted to the broad discretion of the trial judge, there is one antecedent procedural step that is mandatory. The defendant must be afforded the opportunity to explain to the court why he wishes to discharge his counsel. The ultimate decision remains discretionary. What is mandatory is the provision of the opportunity to explain. <em>State v. Brown, </em>342 Md. at 428, 676 A.2d 513, was very clear.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b187-8\"><em>[T]he trial court must determine the reason for the requested discharge before deciding whether dismissal should be allowed. </em>While the trial court has broad discretion, once trial has begun, to determine whether dismissal of counsel is warranted, the court\u2019s discretion is not limitless. <em>The court must conduct an inquiry to assess whether the defendant\u2019s reason for dismissal of counsel justifies any resulting disruption.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b187-9\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b187-10\">In <em>State v. Campbell </em>the defendant was not given nearly as formal an opportunity to address the court as the appellant enjoyed in the present case. Even in that case, however, the informality still did not matter, because preceding exchanges had already made clear to the trial judge the nature of Campbell\u2019s dissatisfaction with his attorney. As long as the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>message itself gets across, that is the critical factor that is dispositive.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b188-4\"><em>Because Campbell\u2019s reasons </em>for wanting to dismiss his counsel <em>were apparent </em>based upon his statements, <em>the trial judge was not required to make any farther inquiry.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b188-5\">385 Md. at 635, 870 A.2d 217 (emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b188-6\"><em>State v. Hardy, </em>415 Md. at 628, 4 A.3d 908, made perspicuously clear that the trial court must provide the defendant a forum. Once that forum has been provided, what the trial court then does by way of response, however, is measured by the deferential abuse of discretion standard.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b188-7\">When a defendant makes a request to discharge counsel at a time when Rule 4-215(e) does not apply strictly, <em>\u201c[t]he court must conduct an inquiry </em>to assess whether the defendant\u2019s reason for dismissal of counsel justifies any resulting disruption\u201d and rule on the request exercising broad discretion. <em>The court\u2019s burden </em>in making this inquiry <em>is to provide the defendant the opportunity to explain his or her reasons for making the request; </em>in other words, <em>the court need not do any more than supply the forum </em>in which the defendant may tender this explanation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b188-8\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b188-9\">At that point, the reins get looser and appellate scrutiny mellows into a more deferential mood.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b188-10\">If the court provides this opportunity, <em>how to address the request is left almost entirely to the court\u2019s \u201csound discretion. \u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b188-11\">415 Md. at 629, 4 A.3d 908 (emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b188-12\">As the preceding pages of this opinion copiously reflect, the appellant was allowed to air his grievances without impediment, even if not to his ultimate satisfaction. The witnesses were excused to the hallway and the jurors were cleared from the courtroom so that the appellant could give full vent to his chagrin at his assigned public defender. He was given an open microphone and was neither gagged nor censored in any way.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>In terms of the ultimate decision not to permit the discharge of counsel, there were substantial factors supporting Judge Jackson\u2019s judgment. He was familiar with the skill and proven experience of the assistant public defender assigned to the appellant, as well as with the perils of <em>pro se </em>representation.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b189-5\">THE COURT: All right you have an attorney. <em>You have an experienced attorney. </em>You have <em>an Assistant Public Defender who I have recognized or have had before me many times and I recognize her to be a very capable criminal defense attorney. </em>You on the other hand told me you have not been to law school, you are not a lawyer, I assume you are not trained in the law in any way. <em>You have a good attorney.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b189-6\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b189-7\">Judge Jackson was also at the procedural control panel and had determined that the appellant was not going to be permitted to do either of those two specific things for which he desired to represent himself, to wit, to recall excused witnesses or to abort the jury trial then in progress. A good reason for denying a requested discharge is the awareness that by the discharge the appellant will be able to accomplish nothing that he seeks to accomplish.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-8\">Judge Jackson was alert to the forensic white water that lay ahead for a legally untrained layman.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b189-9\">THE COURT: We still have a lot to do in this trial, there are more witnesses to call from the State\u2019s point of view, including two expert witnesses. I doubt very seriously you know how to cross-examine an expert witness.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b189-10\">There may always be, moreover, factors that do not appear in the cold record before us. It is the trial judge who has lived through the trial process and has observed the players. He is there on the ground and his thumb is on the pulse of the trial. He just may have the intuitive \u201csense\u201d or \u201cfeel\u201d that the appellant is a loose cannon on the deck and that entrusting to him the conduct of the rest of the trial could be an invitation to disaster. This for us, of course, is only conjecture, but it is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>why appellate review defers to the umpire on the field and does not presume to second-guess judgment calls.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-4\">Even if, <em>arguendo, </em>there were plausible arguments pushing in the opposite direction (we are aware of none), that would create, at most, a moot controversy that judges could reasonably resolve in either direction without abusing their discretion. Judge Jackson did not abuse his discretion in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-5\">JUDGMENT AFFIRMED; COSTS TO BE PAID BY APPELLANT.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
