After arriving at the homicide unit in a District of Columbia police station, appellant was charged and then placed into an interrogation room, along with two Prince George\u2019s County police officers, Detective Harris <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and Sergeant Gregory McDonald. Immediately prior to being advised of his <em>Miranda </em>rights, appellant made the comment, \u201cI don\u2019t want to say nothing. I don\u2019t know, \u2014 \u201d. The police then gave appellant his <em>Miranda </em>rights, after which he confessed to shooting the victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-6\">Appellant\u2019s subsequent motion to suppress his confession was denied by the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County. Thereafter, appellant and the State agreed to proceed via a not guilty plea on an agreed statement of facts. The court convicted appellant of first degree murder and use of a handgun in the commission of a crime of violence.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Appellant was sentenced to life imprisonment, with all but forty-nine years suspended for first degree murder, and a concurrent twenty years\u2019 incarceration for use of a handgun in the commission of a crime of violence.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-7\">On appeal to this Court, appellant presents two questions for our review, which we have combined into one:<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b326-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>Did the suppression court err by denying appellant\u2019s motion to suppress the inculpatory statement that he made to the police?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b326-5\">For the reasons we shall explain, we answer this question \u201cno\u201d and, therefore, we affirm the judgments of the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-6\">\n<em>BACKGROUND</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AEG\">The Underlying Incident</p>\n<p id=\"b326-7\">For context to our review of the suppression hearing and the trial court\u2019s ruling, we shall summarize the agreed statement of facts presented to the circuit court on February 10, 2012, when appellant entered his not guilty plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-8\">On or about January 10, 2011, appellant and Stephan Weaver<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> agreed to rob Justin DeSha-Overcash of marijuana and money, at gunpoint. The next day, Weaver picked up appellant at a Super Fresh Market in the Glendale area and drove to 38th Avenue in College Park. After Weaver parked across the street from the house where DeSha-Overcash was living, appellant got out of the car alone and put on a ski mask. Brandishing a black ten-millimeter handgun, appellant entered the residence at 8809 38th Avenue and announced a robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-9\">Inside the house, a physical struggle ensued between De-Sha-Overcash and appellant. DeSha-Overcash resisted the robbery by throwing a glass jar at appellant\u2019s head. When the two of them struggled for the gun, appellant shot DeSha-Overcash. Appellant fled the house and ran back to the car where Weaver was waiting. As Weaver drove off, his car was captured by a speed camera fleeing from the scene.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-10\">Inside the car, Weaver asked appellant what happened. Appellant told Weaver that he shot \u201chim,\u201d meaning the victim, \u201cdown low.\u201d Appellant later told the police that he eventually threw the gun that he used during the shooting into the Anacostia River.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>During the subsequent investigation, the police recovered three fired ten-millimeter cartridge casings from the scene of the incident, all of which were determined to have been fired from the same unknown firearm. However, no physical evidence recovered from the scene of the incident was ever linked to appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-4\">Additionally, an autopsy of Justin DeSha-Overcash was conducted by Dr. Russell Alexander of the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner in Baltimore. As part of the autopsy, Dr. Alexander recovered a ten-millimeter bullet, as well as a base jacket fragment from a fired ten-millimeter bullet, from the victim\u2019s abdomen. Dr. Alexander determined that the cause of death was multiple gunshot wounds to the abdomen and that the manner of death was homicide.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-5\">On March 26, 2011, the police arrested Weaver. After being advised of his rights, Weaver confessed to conspiring with appellant to rob the victim at gunpoint by helping to orchestrate the attempted aimed robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-6\">Appellant\u2019s Police Interview</p>\n<p id=\"b327-7\">On March 30, 2011, appellant was brought in for questioning at the District of Columbia homicide unit. Prior to being questioned by Detective Harris and Sergeant McDonald, appellant was charged with twelve criminal offenses, including first degree murder and use of a handgun in the commission of a crime of violence. The interview took place in an interrogation room and was videotaped by a single camera placed in a corner of the room. It is undisputed that appellant was in police custody at the time of his being questioned.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-8\">Appellant admitted diming his interview that he entered the house and eventually shot the victim during an attempted robbery. According to appellant, the victim \u201crushed [him],\u201d at which point appellant \u201cwhipped the gun out.\u201d During the ensuing struggle, appellant explained, he shot the victim twice.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-9\">The Suppression Hearing</p>\n<p id=\"b327-10\">Appellant subsequently moved to suppress his inculpatory statements, arguing that he had unambiguously invoked his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number><em>Miranda </em>right to silence. On December 14, 2011, the circuit court (\u201cthe suppression court\u201d) held a hearing on appellant\u2019s motion to suppress. The DVD containing the interview, and a written transcript of the interview, were admitted into evidence as joint exhibits. At the hearing, appellant testified about his questioning by the police. Neither Detective Harris nor Sergeant McDonald testified at the hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-5\">According to the DVD, which the suppression court viewed, and the transcript of the interview, Detective Harris began the interview by asking appellant several ministerial, \u201cicebreaker\u201d questions concerning his address, contact information, and educational background. Appellant stated, among other things, that he had worked \u201c[o]n and off\u2019 for Safeway for the past six or seven years, and that he attended college for two years on a football scholarship. The interview proceeded as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b328-6\">DETECTIVE HARRIS: (Inaudible). Heard you was fast as lightning. Lightning. Okay. The reason why me and Sergeant McDonald are here, we are investigating an incident that happened in January. We been working nonstop on it. Through our investigation your name came up, okay?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b328-7\">[APPELLANT]: Uh-huh.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b328-8\">DETECTIVE HARRIS: Now, what we have now are what other people have been saying about it. It was enough for us to get an arrest warrant for you, okay? What we\u2019d like to do is give you an opportunity to answer any questions that we may have, or ask us any questions that you have about the incident. We want to ask you questions. You can stop answering at any time. You don\u2019t have to talk to us. We want you to talk to us, to be honest with you. Like I say, it\u2019s your prerogative. Like I said, you can talk to us about anything. If you are wondering what we may have to say, this is your opportunity to say, okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b328-9\">[APPELLANT]: What\u2019s the incident?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b328-10\">DETECTIVE HARRIS: Huh?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b329-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>[APPELLANT]: I said what\u2019s the incident?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b329-4\">DETECTIVE HARRIS: What\u2019s the answer to what?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b329-5\">[APPELLANT]: I said what\u2019s the incident?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b329-6\">DETECTIVE HARRIS: Well, we\u2019ll get into it after I, if you want to know about it, if you want to know what we\u2019re talking about, I\u2019m going to have to read you your rights. You have the right to talk to us, you have the right not to talk to us. You have the right to talk to us and stop talking at any time. You understand that? Like I said, we\u2019d like to lay everything out for you and then sit back and listen to what you have to say. We\u2019ll listen to anything that you have to say. Anything. You can dispute anything that we might say, and then we\u2019ll listen to you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b329-7\">You understand that? Okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b329-8\">Like I said, all we have at this point is what we\u2019ve heard up to this point. We would love to hear from you. You understand? We\u2019re fair. You\u2019ve probably got two of the fairest people at the Homicide Unit talking to you right now, okay? Like I said, that\u2019s your prerogative. Like I said, we\u2019d love to lay it out and get you to talk to us, but like I said, you don\u2019t have to. But we would love for you to talk to us, and we can stop so you can see exactly where we\u2019re coming from and go from there. Is that something you\u2019d like to do?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b329-9\">[APPELLANT]: I don\u2019t even know what\u2019s going on. That\u2019s why I ask you what\u2019s the incident.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b329-10\">DETECTIVE HARRIS: That\u2019s what I said. I can read you your rights. Like I said, after that, we can talk. Like I said, if you don\u2019t like what I\u2019m saying you ain\u2019t got to say nothing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b329-11\">[APPELLANT]: I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on, so I\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b329-12\">DETECTIVE HARRIS: Okay. This incident happened January in College Park. Through our investigation your name came up. Like I said, this is your opportunity to say, yeah, you were involved or no, you weren\u2019t involved.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b330-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>[APPELLANT]: I don\u2019t know anything about what you all are talking about.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b330-4\">SERGEANT MCDONALD: Well, we can get to that. We got to go over your, your rights, first.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b330-5\">[APPELLANT]: I know. I still, I don\u2019t know what,\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b330-6\">SERGEANT MCDONALD: I understand that. I understand that. But we got to go through the process. Before we can ask you were you involved, we got to,\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b330-7\">DETECTIVE HARRIS: We got stuff we got to take care of before we,\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b330-8\">[APPELLANT]: Yeah, I understand that. I still don\u2019t know,\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b330-9\">SERGEANT MCDONALD: I understand that. But we still got to go through the process, though. You know. We want to talk to you, but we got to go through the process.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b330-10\">DETECTIVE HARRIS: We want to lay everything out to you, but you have to agree to, you want to at least hear what we have to say, and that\u2019s fine. But you say you don\u2019t, once we read you your rights, if you don\u2019t have nothing to do with it, then we just get up and roll. But we can\u2019t get into it until we get through that. That\u2019s all I\u2019m saying.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b330-11\">So if you\u2019re sitting here and wondering why you\u2019re here, we, we\u2019re ready to tell you why you are here.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b330-12\">[APPELLANT]: We already know but it\u2019s so, you all sound, it sounds so confusing. I don\u2019t know\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b330-13\">SERGEANT MCDONALD: It\u2019s not confusing. Let me break it down to you like this right here. You be, you watch T.V., right? Do you see when the police walk up to somebody, and we want to ask you, we want to talk to you about something, we always read the person their rights? You\u2019ve seen that on T.V., right? They say, you\u2019ve got the right to remain silent. Anything you say can and will be used against you in court. You\u2019ve heard that before, haven\u2019t you? Yeah. We have to go through <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>that formality to get to what we want to talk about. That\u2019s, we have to go through that formality.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b331-5\">[APPELLANT]: <em>I don\u2019t want to say nothing. I don\u2019t </em>know,\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b331-6\">SERGEANT McDONALD: <em>But you don\u2019t have to say nothing.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b331-7\">[APPELLANT]: <em>Yeah.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b331-8\">SERGEANT MCDONALD: Tom <em>don\u2019t have to say nothing. </em>That\u2019s you know, <em>that\u2019s your right. </em>But to get to one point, from point A to point B, we have to read you your rights. And the key word is, they\u2019re your rights. So we got to read them to you, so you understand.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b331-9\">(Emphasis added). The DVD of the interview reveals that Sergeant McDonald raised his hands and interrupted the end of appellant\u2019s sentence as appellant was saying, \u201cI don\u2019t want to say nothing. I don\u2019t know, \u2014 \u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b331-10\">Shortly after the excerpted portion above, Detective Harris read appellant his <em>Miranda </em>rights. The detective then asked appellant, \u201cwould you like to make a statement or would you like to talk about why we are here, without a lawyer?\u201d As the DVD shows, appellant nodded his head silently up and down, signaling \u201cyes.\u201d Detective Harris then asked appellant if he had been promised anything, \u201coffered any kind of reward or benefit, or ... threatened in any way in order to get [him] to make a statement?\u201d The DVD depicts appellant shaking his head from left to right, signaling \u201cno.\u201d Detective Harris then pulled out a standard Prince George\u2019s County Advice of Rights and Waiver form (\u201cP.G.C. Form 2628\u201d), signed his initials next to each paragraph, and gave the form to appellant. Appellant was then asked to read aloud a portion of the form in order to prove that he could read English, and he did so successfully. At Detective Harris\u2019s request, appellant proceeded to read over the form and signed his initials next to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>each paragraph. During the course of the interview, appellant made the following statement:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b332-5\">[APPELLANT]: Pm going to tell you all.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b332-6\">DETECTIVE HARRIS: What happened?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b332-7\">[APPELLANT]: I\u2019m going in the joint and shit. I\u2019m [sic] didn\u2019t even have a mother fucking gun out, or no shit like that. So, like you said, somebody came in the house. But at this point, there still wasn\u2019t no mother fucking gun or nothing like that. The dude rushed me and shit. So I whipped the gun out and shit. He tried to take the mother fucking gun. So, I shoot the gun, but I don\u2019t want to shoot him. He\u2019s still trying to take the mother fucking gun. Boom. I shoot the gun again. Then after that, I don\u2019t know where the fuck I shot, but I didn\u2019t want to hit him or nothing, no way. I just was trying to get him off me and shit, because he was on me and shit, and then that was that.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b332-8\">Following the evidence and argument by counsel for both parties, the suppression court denied appellant\u2019s motion, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b332-9\">This Court has had an opportunity to review the motion, the opposition, the transcript, the DVD, the evidence admitted, as well as the testimony and the arguments.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b332-10\">The [appellant\u2019s] prior statement, of course, whether in-culpatory or falsely exculpatory, cannot be admitted unless it was elicited in compliance with Miranda procedural safeguards, was voluntarily made under Maryland common law, Maryland constitutional law and the federal constitutional law and did not violate the [appellant\u2019s] right to counsel.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b332-11\">The State must prove by a preponderance of the evidence that [appellant] has been warned adequately and weighed the privilege against self-incrimination knowingly and intelligently under the totality of the circumstances. The Court must consider the [appellant\u2019s] age, and in this case, it\u2019s 23 at the time of the statement. Intelligence; in this case, [appellant] testified that he was a sophomore in college. Experience; the experience of [appellant] is that he\u2019s had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>six to seven prior offenses so that he has both pled before the court and he has experience with the criminal court. Mental capacity; in this situation, there\u2019s no indication that there\u2019s any mental incapacity on the part of [appellant] to the contrary. He testified that he believes himself to be an intelligent person. The interrogation which I will get to shortly; duration, tactics and inducements to confess among the various issues.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b333-5\">In this case, two different issues were raised. One, the issue of the Miranda Waiver, and the second, the volun-tariness of the subsequent confession. The Court notes that at issue in particular is the expression by [appellant] on page 11 of the transcript after [appellant], Sergeant McDonald and Detective Harris had had some lay discussion regarding Miranda Rights. That [appellant] then said, \u201cI don\u2019t want to say nothing. I don\u2019t know.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b333-6\">This Court finds the I don\u2019t know, as the State indicated, to render what would have otherwise been a clear statement at which time the questions would have to stop an ambiguous and equivocal statement. Thereafter, Sergeant McDonald says, but you don\u2019t have to say nothing. [Appellant] says, yeah. Then Sergeant McDonald again says, you don\u2019t have to say nothing. That, you know, that\u2019s your right. And they continue to talk about it and, again, in more or less a lay manner after which [appellant] says, hold on, I\u2019d like to know what\u2019s going on. So if you all got to read me my rights, then go ahead. Where after, the Advice of Rights were presented to [appellant].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b333-7\">Detective Harris went over the Advice of Rights with [appellant]. He asked at this point, would you like to make a statement or would you like to talk about why we are here without a lawyer, and [appellant] nodded his head yes. He then went on to say, have you been promised anything, have you been offered anything, any kind of reward or benefit or have you been threatened in any way in order to get you to make a statement, have I threatened you, has he threatened <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>you, and [appellant] shook his head no. The Advice of Rights went on.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b334-4\">The detective asked [appellant] if he could read, but didn\u2019t take his word for it. He actually had him read something out loud to make sure that he wasn\u2019t just asserting that he was intelligent and literate, but that indeed he was literate, and then gave it to [appellant] to read.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b334-5\">In observing the DVD, one notes that [appellant] did not just take the form and sign it as one often does when one gets a contract, but rather actually took his time and read over the Advice of Rights which he did then sign. Accordingly, this Court does not find the claim, vis-a-vis the Miranda Rights, to be a valid claim and finds the State has met its burden as regards to that claim.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b334-6\">The second issue is the issue of whether or not the actual confessions were coerced and whether they were truly, voluntarily and intelligently made. A review of the DVD indicated that the interrogation was certainly not a long prolonged interrogation. [Appellant] was not cuffed. There was no allegations of any physical coercion, and the interaction between [appellant], Sergeant McDonald and Detective Harris was indeed cordial. To be sure, the detectives distinguished premeditated murder and a robbery gone bad. However, [appellant\u2019s] refusal to acknowledge on the stand that the gone bad part of the robbery gone bad was a shooting of the victim flies in the face of the DVD and the transcript and is simply not credible.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b334-7\">The officers in this matter clearly employed trickery regarding the DNA and fingerprinting, yet such trickery is permissible.[<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>] The question is whether [appellant\u2019s] state<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>ments were coerced or compelled or whether they were freely, voluntarily made.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b335-5\">The Court agrees with the State that [appellant] was well aware that not only did he have an option not to speak, but that he had repeatedly been advised that he could stop speaking at any time even if he had started to speak. The Court further finds that the [appellant\u2019s] statements during the interrogation, including that on Page 36, no matter what you all find out, they\u2019re going to smoke my boots anyway, and that which is found on Page 46 of the transcript, I mean, am I ever going to see the street again, do you all know, indicate that he did not have the misunderstanding that he now alleges.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b335-6\">Considering the totality of the circumstances, this Court does not find that the [appellant\u2019s] decision to give a statement was the product of physical or psychological coercion, nor that the officer\u2019s conduct in this case overbore his will to resist or otherwise brought about a statement not freely self-determined by [appellant]. Accordingly, the Court finds that the State has met its burden of proof, and the motion to suppress will be denied.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b335-7\">(Emphases added).</p>\n<p id=\"b335-8\">Disposition of Appellant\u2019s Criminal Proceedings</p>\n<p id=\"b335-9\">On February 10, 2012, the parties proceeded before the circuit court on an agreed statement of facts, with appellant entering a plea of not guilty. The court found appellant guilty of first degree murder and use of a handgun in the commission of a crime of violence. At sentencing on April 25, 2012, the court imposed on appellant a life sentence, with all but forty-nine years suspended for first degree murder, and a concurrent twenty years\u2019 incarceration for use of a handgun in the commission of a crime of violence.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-10\">This timely appeal followed. Additional facts will be set forth below as necessary to resolve the issues presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>\n<em>DISCUSSION</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b336-4\">In Maryland, the overarching law regarding the use of a criminal defendant\u2019s confession against him is clear.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b336-5\">The introduction of a confession as evidence against an accused at trial is permitted only after it is determined that the confession was (1) \u201cvoluntary under Maryland noncon-stitutional law, (2) voluntary under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution and Article 22 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights, and (3) elicited in conformance with the mandates of <em>Miranda.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b336-6\"><em>Costley v. State, </em>175 Md.App. 90, 105-06, 926 A.2d 769 (2007) (quoting <em>Winder v. State, </em>362 Md. 275, 305-06, 765 A.2d 97 (2001)). Thus, a confession must clear all three hurdles before its use as evidence against a criminal defendant is permitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-7\">In the case <em>sub judice, </em>appellant does not challenge the voluntariness of his confession under the second avenue\u2014 namely, that his confession was obtained in violation of the United States Constitution or the Maryland Declaration of Rights. Rather, he limits himself before this Court to two arguments: (i) the officers failed to comply with Miranda\u2019s requirements; and (ii) the confession was obtained involuntarily under Maryland nonconstitutional law as the result of improper police inducement. Therefore, we will conduct our review accordingly. <em>See </em>Md. Rule 8-504(a)(6) (requiring a party\u2019s brief to contain argument in support of its position on each issue).</p>\n<p id=\"b336-8\">The suppression court\u2019s ruling denying appellant\u2019s motion to suppress is reviewable in this appeal of his convictions. Md. Rule 4-252(h)(2)(C). \u201cWhen reviewing a court\u2019s ruling on a suppression motion, we are constrained to rely solely on what was before the suppression court.\u201d <em>Ballard v. State, </em>420 Md. 480, 484 n. 3, 24 A.3d 96 (2011). Specifically,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"amt-dedup-0\">we consider only those relevant facts produced at the suppression hearing that are most favorable to the State as the prevailing party on the motion.

If the <em>Miranda </em>right to counsel can be invoked at a preliminary hearing, it could be argued, there is no logical reason why it could not be invoked by a letter prior to arrest, or indeed even prior to identification as a suspect. Most rights must be asserted when the government seeks to take the action they protect against. <em>The fact that we have allowed the Miranda right to counsel, once asserted, to be effective with respect to future custodial interrogation does not necessarily mean that we will allow it to be asserted initially outside the context of custodial interrogation, with similar future effect.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b340-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number><em>Marr, </em>134 Md.App. at 174-75, 759 A.2d 327 (quoting <em>McNeil, </em>501 U.S. at 183 n. 3, 111 S.Ct. 2204) (italics added in Marr).</p>\n<p id=\"b340-5\">In the case <em>sub judice, </em>it is undisputed that appellant was in custody at the time he commented, \u201cI don\u2019t want to say nothing, I don\u2019t know, \u2014 \u201d.

We noted further that \u201cat least five federal courts of appeal subsequently have interpreted [footnote 3 of the <em>McNeil </em>opinion] to mean that an individual may not invoke the <em>Miranda </em>right to counsel before custodial interrogation has begun <em>or is imminent.\u201d Marr, </em>134 Md.App. at 175, 759 A.2d 327 (emphasis added) (citing, e.g., <em>United States v.

Because the suspect\u2019s purported invocation of his right to counsel occurred prior to his being in custody, we held that the anticipatory invocation was invalid under our reading of <em>Miranda </em>and its progeny. <em>Marr, </em>134 Md.App. at 178, 759 A.2d 327. We did not reach the issue of \u201cwhether, in addition to custody, interrogation must be actual or at least imminent before the right to counsel can be invoked.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 178, 759 A.2d 327.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>In <em>Costley, </em>we revisited the issue left open by <em>Marr. </em>The suspect had been arrested by a police officer and was being transported in the front seat of the police car to a holding cell. <em>Costley, 175 </em>Md.App. at <em>97, 926 A.2d 769. </em>While stopped at a traffic light, the officer grabbed a Maryland State Police Detention Log form on which he intended to record the suspect\u2019s personal information, such as his name, the case number, address, and social security number. <em>Id. </em>According to the officer\u2019s testimony at the suppression hearing, the officer asked for the suspect\u2019s social security number. <em>Id. </em>The suspect did not acknowledge the officer\u2019s question initially. <em>Id. </em>The officer then asked again for the suspect\u2019s social security number, at which point the suspect stated, \u201cYou have my wallet, don\u2019t you?\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 97-98, 926 A.2d 769. When the officer responded, Wes, but why don\u2019t you make this easier on both of us and just give me the information I need?,\u201d the suspect responded, \u201cI\u2019m not telling you shit.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 98, 926 A.2d 769. Later, after the suspect was placed in the holding cell, the police read him his <em>Miranda </em>rights and obtained a signed waiver form from the suspect, as well as a subsequent statement. <em>Id. </em>As in <em>Marr, </em>the suspect later moved to suppress the statement, and the circuit court denied the suspect\u2019s motion. <em>Id. </em>at 99-100, 926 A.2d 769. Again, we affirmed. <em>Id. </em>at 109-10, 926 A.2d 769.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-4\">In analyzing the suspect\u2019s claim, we noted that the custodial interrogation requirement of <em>Miranda </em>is \u201capplicable to invocation of a suspect\u2019s right to remain silent as well as his or her right to counsel.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 106, 926 A.2d 769 (citing <em>Marr, </em>134 Md.App. at 177, 759 A.2d 327). We elaborated that \u201cthe language of <em>McNeil </em>suggests that custody, <em>absent interrogation, </em>is insufficient.\u201d <em>Costley, </em>175 Md.App. at 111, 926 A.2d 769 (emphasis added). We stated that, under the circumstances, the suspect was not being interrogated when he said, \u201cI\u2019m not telling you shit,\u201d because \u201c[t]he officer\u2019s comments might have been unwise, but the comments complained of were not questions and did not relate to the crime.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 107, 926 A.2d 769. Therefore, we held that the suspect\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number><em>Miranda </em>rights had not attached at the time of his comment. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b343-4\">We analyzed the issue of whether the invocation of the right to counsel was made in the context of interrogation after the suspect was taken into custody in <em>Hoerauf, </em>178 Md.App. at 307, 941 A.2d 1161. In <em>Hoerauf, </em>patrol officers arrested the suspect and brought him to the police station. <em>Id. </em>at 299, 941 A.2d 1161. After arriving at the police station, the suspect was handcuffed to a table and fingerprinted, then placed in a holding cell, where he remained for several hours. <em>Id. </em>at 304, 941 A.2d 1161. The suspect testified at the suppression hearing that, while in the holding cell, he requested several times to call his mother, an attorney. <em>Id. </em>at 304-05, 941 A.2d 1161. The suspect was subsequently brought into an interrogation room and subjected to questioning by a police detective. <em>Id. </em>at 299, 300 n. 5, 941 A.2d 1161. At the suppression hearing, the detective testified that the suspect \u201cdid not want an attorney\u201d while being questioned in the interrogation room. <em>Id. </em>at 303, 941 A.2d 1161. Furthermore, the suspect himself did not remember whether he requested to speak to his mother or otherwise requested an attorney while inside the interrogation room. <em>Id. </em>at 305, 941 A.2d 1161. The suppression court denied the suspect\u2019s motion. <em>Id. </em>at 312, 941 A.2d 1161.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-5\">On appeal, we affirmed the trial court\u2019s conclusion that the suspect \u201cdid not validly invoke his Fifth Amendment right to counsel prior to giving a statement\u201d to the police. <em>Id. </em>at 318, 941 A.2d 1161.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> As we explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b343-6\">We come to the same conclusion in the case <em>sub judice </em>as we did in <em>Costley. </em>Assuming that appellant clearly expressed his desire for the assistance of counsel by repeatedly asking to talk to his mother, an attorney, all such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>requests were made by appellant prior to being placed in the interrogation room and questioned by Detective So-felkanik. As found by the trial court, and not disputed by appellant, at no time from his entry into the interrogation room until the completion of his statement did appellant ask to speak with his mother, or otherwise request the assistance of counsel. Accordingly, we hold that appellant did not validly invoke his Fifth Amendment right to counsel prior to giving a statement to Detective Sofelkanik.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b344-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 318, 941 A.2d 1161 (emphasis added). Stated another way, we held that, where the suspect <em>does not </em>invoke his <em>Miranda </em>right after \u201chis entry into the interrogation room,\u201d his prior invocation <em>was not </em>valid, <em>i.e., </em>such invocation was not made in the context of custodial interrogation. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b344-6\">In the case <em>sub judice, </em>we conclude that appellant\u2019s <em>Miranda </em>rights had attached by the time that he made the critical comment to Detective Harris and Sergeant McDonald. In contrast to the suspect in <em>Hoerauf, </em>appellant\u2019s comment was made after he was placed in the interrogation room and after he began speaking with the police. Although actual interrogation had not yet commenced, because Detective Harris had only a \u201clay discussion\u201d with, and asked \u201cicebreaker\u201d questions of, appellant up to that point, the interrogation was \u201cimminent.\u201d <em>See Marr, </em>134 Md.App. at 174-75, 759 A.2d 327. Appellant had already been arrested and had entered an interrogation room, where he remained in close physical proximity with two police officers. In addition, prior to appellant\u2019s comment, the officers told appellant at least three separate times that they would be advising appellant of his <em>Miranda </em>rights. Detective Harris explained: \u201cYou have the right to talk to us, you have the right not to talk to us. You have the right to talk to us and stop talking at any time.\u201d In short, these circumstances present the \u201ccompelling atmosphere\u201d\u2014 and its corresponding danger of \u201cinherent compulsion\u201d \u2014 that the <em>Miranda </em>prophylaxis was expressly designed to guard against. <em>Id. </em>at 173, 177, 759 A.2d 327 (citing <em>Alston, </em>34 F.3d at 1247). Therefore, we hold that appellant\u2019s comment was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>made \u201cin the context of custodial interrogation,\u201d <em>McNeil, </em>501 U.S. at 182 n. 3, 111 S.Ct. 2204 and consequently, appellant could invoke his right to silence under <em>Miranda.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b345-4\">Appellant was, as he argues in his brief, \u201cin the right time and place to invoke\u201d his <em>Miranda </em>rights and, thereby, terminate the interrogation if he so chose. <em>See McNeil, </em>501 U.S. at 182 n. 3, 111 S.Ct. 2204 (\u201cMost rights must be asserted when the government seeks to take the action they protect against.\u201d). We must now evaluate whether appellant\u2019s comment, \u201cI don\u2019t want to say nothing. I don\u2019t know, \u2014 \u201d was, as a matter of law, a valid invocation of his right to silence.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-5\">\n<em>B.

I don\u2019t know, \u2014 \u2019 to which the police responded \u2018but you don\u2019t have to say nothing\u2019 but continued with the interrogation.\u201d In support of this contention, appellant argues that he \u201cclearly, unambiguously and unequivocally invoked his right to remain silent.\u201d Pointing to the context in which appellant\u2019s statement was made during the videotaped questioning, as well as the transcript itself, appellant claims that, \u201c[i]t is clear from [his] body language, tone and speed and cadence of his speech that the second sentence was going to be consistent with the first sentence and that he was not equivocating.\u201d To that end, appellant asserts that \u201c[i]t makes no sense whatsoever for [appellant] to say in the same breath, ... I want to remain silent and then I don\u2019t know.\u201d Instead, appellant claims, \u201c[t]he only reasonable interpretation is that [appellant\u2019s] second sentence was a continuation and not a renunciation of the sentence he spoke not one second earlier.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b345-7\">Appellant also argues that \u201cthere is no need to speculate what a reasonable officer would have interpreted [appellant\u2019s] statement to mean,\u201d because the police officers questioning appellant clearly understood his statement as an invocation of his right to silence. In support of this claim, appellant notes that the officers \u201crepeated back to [appellant] twice \u2018But you don\u2019t have to say nothing.\u2019 \u201d Indeed, appellant asserts, Ser<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>geant McDonald cut him off by raising both of his hands and speaking over appellant as he was saying \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d From this, appellant argues that \u201c[t]he State cannot have the police silence a criminal defendant during his attempt to invoke the right to remain silent and then claim that said defendant failed to invoke that right.\u201d Therefore, appellant claims, the police did not \u201cscrupulously honor[ ]\u201d his invocation of his right to silence, and the suppression court erred in failing to suppress his statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-5\">The State asserts, in response, that, \u201cthe motions court properly found that [appellant\u2019s] invocation was ambiguous and equivocal and did not preclude the officers from obtaining his <em>Miranda </em>waiver and questioning him.\u201d Specifically, the State claims that appellant\u2019s statement was \u201cgiven while police were explaining the \u2018process\u2019 of going through his <em>[Miranda </em>] rights,\u201d and, therefore, \u201ccould be reasonably understood by the police to be a matter of [appellant] trying to decide his course of action in dealing with the police, particularly in light of his subsequent advisement and waiver of those rights and his decision to speak with the police.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b346-6\">In denying appellant\u2019s motion on this issue at the close of the December 14 hearing, the suppression court determined that, \u201cthe I don\u2019t know, as the State indicated, [ ] render[s] what would have otherwise been a clear statement at which time the questions would have to stop an ambiguous and equivocal statement.\u201d The suppression court further concluded that, following appellant\u2019s statement, the officers properly proceeded through the Advice of Rights form with appellant before ultimately obtaining his confession. Accordingly, the court \u201c[did] not find [appellant\u2019s] claim, vis-a-vis the Miranda Rights, to be a valid claim\u201d and \u201c[ruled] the State has met its burden as regards to that claim.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b346-7\">In <em>Davis v. United States, </em>a case involving the right to counsel, the Supreme Court explained that the</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ADhy\">[invocation of the <em>Miranda </em>right to counsel \u201crequires, at a minimum, some statement that can reasonably be construed to be an expression of a desire for the assistance of an attorney.\u201d But if a suspect makes a reference to an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>attorney that is ambiguous or equivocal in that a reasonable officer in light of the circumstances would have understood only that the suspect <em>might </em>be invoking the right to counsel, our precedents do not require the cessation of questioning.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b347-5\">Rather, the suspect must unambiguously request counsel. As we have observed, \u201ca statement either is such an assertion of the right to counsel or it is not.\u201d Although a suspect need not \u201cspeak with the discrimination of an Oxford don,\u201d he must articulate his desire to have counsel present sufficiently clearly that a reasonable police officer in the circumstances would understand the statement to be a request for an attorney. If the statement fails to meet the requisite level of clarity, <em>Edwards [v.

After discussing the <em>Davis </em>precedent, the Court explained that \u201cthere is no principled reason to adopt different standards for determining when an accused has invoked the <em>Miranda </em>right to remain silent and the <em>Miranda </em>right to counsel at issue in <em>Davis.\u201d Id. </em>at 381, 130 S.Ct. 2250.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b347-7\">Consequently, it is the law in Maryland that a suspect in custodial interrogation must unequivocally and unambigu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>ously invoke his or her right to silence before the police are required to terminate the interrogation. Furthermore, as we have noted, the <em>Davis </em>standard applies to both <em>post-Miranda </em>waiver and pr <em>e-Miranda </em>waiver situations, as in the case <em>sub judice. See Wimbish, </em>201 Md.App. at 253, 29 A.3d 635 (citing <em>Berghuis, </em>560 U.S. at 378-82, 130 S.Ct. 2250). Therefore, using an objective standard, we must evaluate whether a reasonable police officer under the circumstances present in the instant case would understand appellant\u2019s statement to be an invocation of the right to silence. <em>See Ballard, </em>420 Md. at 490, 24 A.3d 96 (noting that the inquiry is objective).</p>\n<p id=\"b348-5\">As the State conceded below, the isolated statement \u201cI don\u2019t want to say nothing\u201d would be unambiguous. <em>See also People v. Arroyo, </em>988 P.2d 1124, 1133 (Colo.1999) (\u201cI don\u2019t wanna talk no more\u201d held to be an unambiguous invocation); <em>Ballard, </em>420 Md. at 491, 24 A.3d 96 (\u201cYou mind if I not say no more and just talk to an attorney about this\u201d held to be an unambiguous invocation of suspect\u2019s right to counsel); <em>Law v.

We agree with the suppression court, however, that the \u201cI don\u2019t know, \u2014 \u201d appended to the statement, and made by appellant in the same breath as the first portion of his comment, \u201crender[s] what would have otherwise been a clear statement at which time the questions would have to stop an ambiguous and equivocal statement.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>As a classic expression of uncertainty, \u201cI don\u2019t know\u201d introduced a level of doubt into the message being communicated by appellant to Detective Harris and Sergeant McDonald. Indeed, the inclusion of those three words strongly suggest that appellant himself \u2014 let alone the police officers whom the law charges with understanding his intent \u2014 was unsure of how to proceed.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> At most, appellant\u2019s comment suggested that he <em>might </em>want to remain silent. <em>See Wimbish, </em>201 Md.App. at 259, 29 A.3d 635 (\u201cIf appellant\u2019s comment indicated that he <em>might </em>want a lawyer provided, that was not enough, under <em>Davis, </em>to require the detectives to end the interview.\u201d). Consequently, we cannot say that a reasonable police officer faced with the same circumstances would find appellant\u2019s comment an unambiguous and unequivocal invocation of the right to silence.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-5\">Furthermore, appellant\u2019s comment was more ambiguous when placed in context with the other statements that he had made in the interrogation room up to that point. Courts from other jurisdictions have concluded that a suspect\u2019s comments that \u201ccould be construed as an invocation of [the] right to remain silent\u201d may be ambiguous after examining the circumstances under which those comments were made. <em>United States v.

I don\u2019t know, \u2014 \u201d suggest that appellant was merely trying to ascertain from the police what was the specific incident they were investigating.

Voluntariness of Appellant\u2019s Confession Under Maryland Common Law</p>\n<p id=\"b351-5\">Appellant argues that his confession was involuntary \u201cunder Maryland common law because the police implied that [he] might see outside again if he confessed to a robbery gone bad instead of a premeditated murder.\u201d Appellant further contends that the police \u201cdid more than just present [appellant] with two different characterizations of the crime at issue.\u201d Instead, appellant asserts that, through their statements, \u201cthe police made it clear that if [appellant] confessed that he had committed the murder, but that it was a \u2018robbery gone bad\u2019 as opposed to a premeditated murder,\u201d he might \u201csee outside again\u201d or receive some other form of a less harsh sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-6\">Citing <em>Ball v. State </em>and <em>Smith v. State, </em>the State responds that the police officers did not improperly induce appellant to give his confession. <em>Ball, </em>347 Md. 156, 699 A.2d 1170 (1997), <em>cert. denied, </em>522 U.S. 1082, 118 S.Ct. 866, 139 L.Ed.2d 763 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>(1998); <em>Smith, </em>20 Md.App. 577, 591, 318 A.2d 568, <em>cert.. denied, </em>272 Md. 748 (1974), <em>cert. denied, </em>420 U.S. 984, 95 S.Ct. 1416, 43 L.Ed.2d 666 (1975). The State further responds that the police merely \u201cpresented two versions of facts with respect to the shooting.\u201d Furthermore, according to the State, \u201c[t]he police never threatened [appellant] with a longer prison sentence, or promised a lighter sentence if he confessed\u201d; rather, \u201cthey were explaining that \u2018[t]here were two different charges here,\u2019 explaining the differences between premeditated murder, and a possible accidental shooting during a botched robbery.\u201d The State asserts that, to the extent that the police made reference \u201cto a longer sentence associated with [the] first-degree premeditated murder version of facts,\u201d they were merely stating \u201cpossible legal consequences of the findings of fact at trial.\u201d Nor, the State argues, did the police officers improperly promise benefits to appellant, because \u201cany benefit to [appellant] based on the facts of the case would have nothing to do with the officer\u2019s actions.\u201d Instead, the benefit \u201cwould come from the state of the law, or a decision by a fact-finder, which is entirely out of the officer\u2019s hands.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b352-4\">As an appellate court, we \u201cundertaken a <em>de novo </em>review of the [suppression court]\u2019s ultimate determination on the issue of voluntariness.\u201d <em>Knight v. State, </em>381 Md. 517, 535, 850 A.2d 1179 (2004). Our review is guided by the following principles of Maryland nonconstitutional law.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-5\">\u201c[A] confession that is preceded or accompanied by threats or a promise of advantage will be held involuntary, notwithstanding any other factors that may suggest voluntariness, unless the State can establish that such threats or promises in no way induced the confession.\u201d <em>Hill v. State, </em>418 Md. 62, 75-76, 12 A.3d 1193 (2011). In evaluating whether a confession was improperly induced by the police, we are guided by the two-pronged test set forth in <em>Hillard v. State, </em>286 Md. 145, 406 A.2d 415 (1979), and explained again recently by the Court of Appeals in <em>Hill:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b352-6\">[A]n inculpatory statement is involuntary and must be suppressed if: (1) any officer or agent of the police force <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>promises or implies to a suspect that he will be given special consideration from a prosecuting authority or some other form of assistance in exchange for the suspect\u2019s confession, and (2) the suspect makes a confession in apparent reliance on the police officer\u2019s explicit or implicit inducement. Both prongs of the <em>Hillard </em>test must be satisfied before a confession is deemed to be involuntary.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b353-5\">The first prong of the <em>Hillard </em>test is an objective one. In other words, when determining whether a police officer\u2019s conduct satisfies the first prong, the court must determine whether a reasonable person in the position of the accused would be moved to make an inculpatory statement upon hearing the officer\u2019s declaration; an accused\u2019s subjective belief that he will receive a benefit in exchange for a confession carries no weight under this prong. Ultimately, the court must determine whether the interrogating officers or an agent of the police made a threat, promise, or inducement. The threat, promise, or inducement can be considered improper regardless whether it is express or implied.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b353-6\">If the suppression court finds that the law enforcement officer improperly induced the accused, then the second prong of the <em>Hillard </em>test requires the court to determine whether the accused relied on that inducement in making the statement he or she seeks to suppress. Specifically, the court must examine whether there exists a causal nexus between the inducement and the statement!)]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b353-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 76-77, 12 A.3d 1193 (emphasis added) (citations and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b353-8\">In denying appellant\u2019s motion on this issue, the suppression court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b353-9\">The [ ] issue is ... whether or not the actual confessions were coerced and whether they were truly, voluntarily and intelligently made. A review of the DVD indicated that the interrogation was certainly not a long prolonged interrogation. [Appellant] was not cuffed. There was no allegations <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>of any physical coercion, and the interaction between [appellant], Sergeant McDonald and Detective Harris was indeed cordial. To be sure, the detectives distinguished premeditated murder and a robbery gone bad. However, [appellant\u2019s] refusal to acknowledge on the stand that the gone bad part of the robbery gone bad was a shooting of the victim flies in the face of the DVD and the transcript and is simply not credible.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-5\">The officers in this matter clearly employed trickery regarding the DNA and fingerprinting, yet such trickery is permissible. The question is whether [appellant\u2019s] statements were coerced or compelled or whether they were freely, voluntarily made.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-6\">The Court agrees with the State that [appellant] was well aware that not only did he have an option not to speak, but that he had repeatedly been advised that he could stop speaking at any time even if he had started to speak. The Court further finds that [appellant\u2019s] statements during the interrogation, including that on Page 36, no matter what you all find out, they\u2019re going to smoke my boots anyway, and that which is found on Page 46 of the transcript, I mean, am I ever going to see the street again, do you all know, indicate that he did not have the misunderstanding that he now alleges.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-7\">Considering the totality of the circumstances, this Court does not find that the [appellant\u2019s] decision to give a statement was the product of physical or psychological coercion, nor that the officer\u2019s conduct in this case overbore his will to resist or otherwise brought about a statement not freely self-determined by [appellant]. Accordingly, the Court finds that the State has met its burden of proof, and the motion to suppress will be denied.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b354-8\">\u201cThose statements that have been held to be improper inducements have involved promises by the interrogating officers either to exercise their discretion or to convince the prosecutor to exercise discretion to provide some special advantage to the suspect.\u201d <em>Knight, </em>381 Md. at 536 &amp; n. 14, 850 A.2d 1179 (compiling a list of statements held to be improper <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>inducements); <em>see also Winder, </em>362 Md. at 313-14, 316, 765 A.2d 97 (promises of \u201cspecial consideration in the prosecution of [a suspect]\u2019s case\u201d and implied promises of guaranteeing suspect\u2019s personal protection against acts of revenge or going to prison are improper inducements). Beyond this, though, \u201c \u2018[c]oercive barnacles\u2019 can take many forms and are not limited to instances in which interrogating officers promise <em>their </em>assistance to the accused.\u201d <em>Hill, </em>418 Md. at 80, 12 A.3d 1193 (quoting <em>Hillard, </em>286 Md. at 150, 406 A.2d 415). Thus in <em>Hill, </em>the Court of Appeals held that a detective\u2019s promise (or suggestion) that the victim\u2019s family \u201cdid not want to see [the suspect] get into trouble, but they only wanted an apology\u201d improperly implied that the family would assist the suspect in \u201cavoid[ing] criminal charges or, at the least, lessen the likelihood of a successful criminal prosecution.\u201d 418 Md. at 79-10, 12 A.3d 650. Thus \u201cspecial consideration from a prosecuting authority or some other form of assistance in exchange for the suspect\u2019s confession\u201d is improper. <em>Id. </em>at 76, 12 A.3d 650.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-4\">On the other hand, \u201ca promise to a suspect that the interrogator truthfully would inform the prosecutor that the suspect either did or did not cooperate is not a promise of special advantage,\u201d and, therefore, not an improper inducement. <em>Knight, </em>381 Md. at 536, 850 A.2d 1179. Further, \u201can appeal to \u2018the inner psychological pressure of conscience to tell the truth does not constitute coercion in the legal sense.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ball, </em>347 Md. at 179, 699 A.2d 1170 (quoting <em>Kier v. State, </em>213 Md. 556, 562, 132 A.2d 494 (1957)); <em>see also Smith, </em>20 Md.App. at 591, 318 A.2d 568 (\u201c[A] mere exhortation to tell the truth [does] not amount to a prohibited inducement.\u201d) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b355-5\">In the instant case, after Detective Harris and Sergeant McDonald advised appellant of his <em>Miranda </em>rights, both orally and in writing via an Advice of Rights form, appellant waived his rights and agreed to speak with the officers. As the questioning proceeded, appellant told the police that the incident \u201cwasn\u2019t supposed to be nothing but a robbery.\u201d Detective Harris then went on at length, speaking largely uninterrupted by either appellant or Sergeant McDonald:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b356-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>At this point, we can\u2019t believe what he said because in my opinion, or in our opinion, you could have just went in there, shot the dude, took whatever he had. You have no witnesses at that point, and rolled out. But, [the driverj\u2019s just saying that you had no intentions other than going in there.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b356-5\">There are two different charges here. There is a premeditated going in, blasting somebody away, taking their stuff and roll. That\u2019s a bad charge. We go by [the driver\u2019s] story, the fact that you went in there, he had no intentions on killing this dude. None. Stuff got out of hand, the dude wouldn\u2019t talk, wouldn\u2019t putting up what he was saying. The dude is a big dude. You\u2019re kind of a slim dude, and he wanted to fight. He wanted to see whether or not you had balls enough to pull the trigger. Came after you, you gave a warning shot. He still wouldn\u2019t listen to what you were saying, and then bam, all hell broke loose. Glass breaking, whole nine.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b356-6\">That\u2019s a different charge, okay? All I\u2019m saying is, I would not, if I were you, I would not want us to leave here thinking that you walked in that house, popped this dude, premeditated, walked in there, I\u2019m going to kill this cat, take everything in the house, and roll out. You may never see outside again if you let us leave here thinking that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b356-7\">We\u2019re trying to figure out what happened. Did you just go in there, cold blooded, shot that dude for no reason, or you just went in there to do what somebody did to you, just to get back on your feet and get hack in the game? Now, like I said, you\u2019re a smart dude. You can tell if you\u2019re looking at me, I ain\u2019t playing. I\u2019m telling you. There\u2019s only two ways out of this thing. That you go in there, gun that man (indiscernible), flat out no heart, cold blooded like you, like you could care less about life or you were in there just to do, and you wasn\u2019t even as violent as the person who did that to you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b357-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>We can\u2019t go by what [the driver] said why you were there or what happened, because they may be trying to cover up, you know, make it look good for you. Maybe they\u2019re trying to help you out. Hey man, he didn\u2019t mean to shoot nobody. Man, who, I\u2019m the police. As far as I\u2019m concerned, you walked up in that joint with the intentions of killing that dude.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b357-4\">But I need to hear from you and figure out how sincere you are that that\u2019s not what you meant to happen. That\u2019s the only reason why we\u2019re here, and if we were some heartless bastards we could just, screw it, first degree murder. He went in there. He premeditatedly killed that dude, and that\u2019s it. We ain\u2019t taking no deals. We\u2019re walking out the door. We ain\u2019t even talking to you. Send you straight to jail. I mean, if that\u2019s the way, I mean, but we\u2019re not like that. We, we want to give people opportunities.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b357-5\">You\u2019re another black guy. You\u2019re still young, and I want to make sure that you get every opportunity to tell us the truth. Tell us that you\u2019re not a heartless bastard and went in there and just killed that dude. We want to know that.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b357-6\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b357-7\">Later in the interview, appellant expressed concern to the officers about the potential consequences of his charges, saying, \u201cYou all tell me I\u2019m already being charged with that shit. No matter what you all find out, they\u2019re going to smoke my boots anyway.\u201d The officers denied that this was where things stood, and told appellant that his \u201cstatement goes a long way.\u201d Detective Harris then informed appellant of two possible outcomes, as he saw it: \u201cIt could be as simple as a robbery gone bad, or a flat out cold blooded first degree murder. It\u2019s as simple as that. Robbery gone bad. First degree murder. Prove it.\u201d Immediately thereafter, appellant stated, \u201cI\u2019m going to tell you all[,]\u201d and confessed that he shot the victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-8\">Appellant claims that \u201cthe implication of [what the police told him] is that if [appellant] were to confess to a robbery <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>gone bad, the police would be able to ensure that [appellant] would \u2018see outside again.\u2019 \u201d Appellant also argues that he \u201cwas left with the idea that a deal might be offered, and that his \u2018boots might not be smoked\u2019 if he confessed to a robbery gone bad.\u201d Viewing these claims objectively, we do not agree that Detective Harris\u2019s statements would cause a layperson to form such beliefs and inferences. Thus, we conclude that there was no improper inducement made by the State in eliciting appellant\u2019s confession.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-5\">We find <em>Ball v. State </em>of great value in evaluating this issue. In <em>Ball, </em>the police were investigating a burglary in which the victim was fatally shot multiple times in the torso. 347 Md. at 167, 699 A.2d 1170. Their investigation eventually led them to the appellant as a suspect, and the police brought him in for questioning. <em>Id. </em>at 167-68, 699 A.2d 1170. After properly <em>Mimndizing </em>the appellant, the interrogating officers presented the appellant with two documents that one of the officers had prepared ahead of time. <em>Id. </em>at 168, 699 A.2d 1170. The two documents were organized in a parallel structure, with each weaving a narrative hypothesizing about what happened during the shooting. <em>Id. </em>The first document stated that the victim was \u201cbrutally killed\u201d in her parents\u2019 home, and that the appellant \u201cis a cold blooded killer\u201d who \u201chas no regard for human life\u201d and \u201cwould kill again because he liked it.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The second document, by comparison, painted a softer portrait of the incident. <em>Id. </em>at 169, 699 A.2d 1170. In this version, the victim was \u201caccidentally killed,\u201d and the appellant \u201chas had a tough life,\u201d and \u201cdidn\u2019t want to\u201d kill the victim, but did so during a struggle with the victim and \u201cbecause he was afraid she could identify him.\u201d <em>Id. </em>One of the detectives testified that, after reading the documents, the appellant asked him, \u201cwhat do they do for me.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The detective explained to the appellant that the documents \u201cwere two different ways of characterizing [the appellant].\u201d <em>Id. </em>After further discussion between the appellant and the police, the appellant orally confessed to killing the victim and then provided a written confession. <em>Id. </em>at 170, 172, 699 A.2d 1170. Before trial, the circuit court denied the appellant\u2019s motion to suppress both <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>the oral and written statements. <em>Id. </em>at 172, 699 A.2d 1170. Subsequently, the suspect was convicted of first degree murder and sentenced to death. <em>Id. </em>at 172-73, 699 A.2d 1170.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-5\">The Court of Appeals affirmed the conviction. <em>Id. </em>at 207, 699 A.2d 1170. Recognizing that \u201cdeception short of an overbearing inducement is a valid weapon of the police arsenal,\u201d the Court noted that the police \u201care permitted to trick the suspect into making an inculpatory statement.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 178-79, 699 A.2d 1170 (citations and internal quotation marks omitted). The trickery used by the police was that both documents presented fact patterns that supported first degree murder convictions, albeit under different theories \u2014 namely, first degree premeditated murder and felony murder, respectively. <em>See id. </em>at 180, 699 A.2d 1170. The Court then determined that the record did not support the appellant\u2019s assertion that the police somehow took advantage of his ignorance. <em>Id. </em>Instead, the Court explained, \u201cdeception short of an overbearing inducement is a valid weapon of the police arsenal,\u201d and \u201c[similarly, an appeal to the inner psychological pressure of conscience to tell the truth does not constitute coercion in the legal sense.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 178-79, 699 A.2d 1170. Therefore, the Court concluded that the appellant\u2019s confession was not rendered involuntary.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-6\">The case before us is strikingly similar to <em>Ball. </em>Here, Detective Harris stated (albeit more explicitly than the officer in Ball) that there were \u201ctwo different charges\u201d: \u201ca premeditated\u201d murder that revealed appellant to have \u201cflat out no heart\u201d and be \u201ccold blooded like [he] ... could care less about life,\u201d and \u201cshot that dude for no reason,\u201d <em>or </em>an accidental killing in which appellant went to rob the victim\u2019s house with \u201cno intentions on killing this dude.\u201d In the latter version, appellant went in \u201cjust to get back on [his] feet and get back in the game,\u201d <em>i.e., </em>obtain enough drugs to viably deal them to others for his financial well-being, but encountered \u201ca big dude\u201d who \u201cwanted to fight\u201d and came after him such that \u201call hell broke loose.\u201d What the officers did not tell appellant was that, regardless of whether the scenario was a \u201crobbery gone bad\u201d or \u201ca flat out cold blooded first degree murder,\u201d appel<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>lant would, just like the suspect in <em>Ball, </em>face the identical criminal penalty (a conviction of first degree murder), albeit on different theories (first degree premeditated murder versus felony murder). Such conduct does not constitute an improper inducement under Maryland law. <em>See id. </em>at 176, 699 A.2d 1170.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-4\">In addition, we conclude that neither officer promised or even suggested that either they or someone else involved in the case would assist in obtaining a more favorable prosecuto-rial outcome for appellant. Although Detective Harris told appellant that he \u201cmay never see outside again\u201d if the officers were left with the impression that appellant was guilty of premeditated first degree murder, Detective Harris did not give any indication that he would obtain special consideration from the court or the prosecutor on appellant\u2019s behalf. <em>See Hill, </em>418 Md. at 76, 12 A.3d 1193. <em>Compare Winder, </em>362 Md. at 314, 765 A.2d 97 (finding improper inducement where the police told the suspect, among other things, that they were \u201cnot interested in sending [him] to jail for the rest of [his] life,\u201d and repeatedly promised to get \u201chelp\u201d for the suspect, both from the police themselves and from the State\u2019s Attorney\u2019s Office). Instead, Detective Harris was merely advising appellant of the <em>possible </em>legal consequences of a verdict of first degree premeditated murder at appellant\u2019s future trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-5\">Detective Harris further explained during his lengthy comment to appellant that he wanted to ensure that appellant \u201cget every opportunity to tell us the truth.\u201d This latter entreaty to appellant\u2019s sense of conscience was among the last words appellant heard before confessing to killing the victim. Such appeals to conscience are plainly permissible under our case law. <em>See Kier, </em>213 Md. at 562, 132 A.2d 494.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-6\">Finally, appellant\u2019s statement that the police (and, by proxy, the State) were \u201cgoing to smoke [his] boots anyway,\u201d followed by the officers\u2019 denial of that assertion, along with the suggestion to appellant that his \u201cstatement goes a long way,\u201d did not constitute an improper promise or inducement by the police. Again, neither officer indicated that he would help <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>appellant with the prosecutor or the court in exchange for his confession. Moreover, encouraging a suspect to adopt a version of the facts that might mitigate the punishment for the crime that the suspect committed is not an improper inducement under Maryland law. <em>See Smith, </em>20 Md.App. at 591, 318 A.2d 568 (holding that a detective\u2019s statement \u201cthat the court might take into consideration a version by the accused of the fire being accidental\u201d was not an improper inducement); see <em>also Merchant v. State, </em>217 Md. 61, 69-70, 141 A.2d 487 (1958) (holding that an officer\u2019s statement that he did not know whether or not it would be \u201ceasier\u201d on the suspect if he told the truth, but encouraged the suspect to do so regardless, did not improperly induce a confession).</p>\n<p id=\"b361-4\">Therefore, we conclude that the police did not make any improper promises or inducements to secure appellant\u2019s confession. Accordingly, appellant\u2019s confession was not involuntary under Maryland\u2019s nonconstitutional law.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-5\">JUDGMENTS OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR PRINCE GEORGE\u2019S COUNTY AFFIRMED; APPELLANT TO PAY COSTS.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b325-8\">.

This Court has reviewed the DVD of the interview.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b334-8\">. Appellant makes no argument in his brief that the officers\u2019 references to finding his DNA and fingerprints at the scene of the crime was improperly deceptive. We note that the police \"are permitted to use a certain amount of subterfuge, when questioning an individual about his or her suspected involvement in a crime.\u201d <em>Ball v. State, </em>347 Md. 156, 178, 699 A.2d 1170 (1997), <em>cert. denied, </em>522 U.S. 1082, 118 S.Ct. 866, 139 L.Ed.2d 763 (1998).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b338-9\">. There is not a <em>per se </em>bar, however, to subsequent police questioning following an invocation of the right to silence. A \"defendant\u2019s invocation of his right to remain silent does not preclude later questioning for an indefinite period.\u201d <em>Costley v. State, </em>175 Md.App. 90, 107, 926 A.2d 769 (2007) (citing <em>Michigan v. Mosley, </em>423 U.S. 96, 102-03, 96 S.Ct. 321, 46 L.Ed.2d 313 (1975)). At the very least, however, police must \"suspend[] questioning entirely for a significant period\u201d of time before reinitiating an interrogation. <em>Mosley, </em>423 U.S. at 107, 96 S.Ct. 321.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-10\">There is likewise no <em>Miranda </em>violation where the person being questioned voluntarily reinitiates the interview with the police. <em>See </em>384 U.S. at 478, 86 S.Ct. 1602. Further, even where there <em>is </em>a <em>Miranda </em>violation, the law \"does not preclude a later voluntary confession by a defendant.\u201d <em>Costley, </em>175 Md.App. at 109, 926 A.2d 769.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b343-7\">. Although this Court ultimately reversed the judgment of the trial court in <em>Hoerauf v. State, </em>it did so for reasons unrelated to those posed by the instant appeal \u2014 namely, that the trial court abused its discretion in propounding a pattern jury instruction on flight. <em>See </em>178 Md.App. 292, 318-28, 941 A.2d 1161 (2008).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b347-8\">. In <em>Freeman v. State, </em>this Court held that, before a suspect has waived his or her <em>Miranda </em>rights, an ambiguous invocation of the right to silence restricted the police to merely asking clarifying questions. 158 Md.App. 402, 433, 857 A.2d 557 (2004). However, as we noted in <em>Wimbish v. State, Freeman </em>was decided \u201cin the absence of any clear indication from the Supreme Court as to [the] reach\u201d of <em>Davis v. United </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number><em>States, </em>512 U.S. 452, 458, 114 S.Ct. 2350, 129 L.Ed.2d 362 (1994). 201 Md.App. 239, 252, 29 A.3d 635 (2011). Thus, following <em>Berghuis v. Thompkins, </em>560 U.S. 370, 130 S.Ct. 2250, 176 L.Ed.2d 1098 (2010), we noted that, \"it appears that our holding in <em>Freeman </em>... is no longer viable.\u201d <em>Wimbish, </em>201 Md.App. at 254 n. 8, 29 A.3d 635 (citing Andrew V.

In addition, all of the cases that we have found analyzing comments that include the phrase \u201cI don't know\u201d found such comments to be ambiguous. <em>See Commonwealth v.

We would be remiss if we did not discuss the nonverbal conduct of the police officers, as captured on the DVD. Such consideration is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>permissible, because it is clear from the record that the suppression court was presented with and actually watched the DVD. <em>See Rush v. State, </em>403 Md. 68, 104, 939 A.2d 689 (2008) (remanding for consideration of both the interview transcript and DVD, because the \u201cobservation of [] inflections and demeanor ... may differ from those inferences that can be drawn from the bare transcript\u201d). As mentioned <em>supra, </em>appellant was interrupted in the midst of his statement (\u201cI don\u2019t want to say nothing. I don't know, \u2014 \u201d) by Sergeant McDonald, who noticeably raised his hands and spoke with a forceful tone.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-8\">Nothing we state in this opinion should be read to condone police conduct, verbal or nonverbal, that seeks to prevent a suspect\u2019s invocation of his <em>Miranda </em>rights by metaphorically \"put[ting] masking tape\u201d on the suspect\u2019s mouth, as appellant argued to the suppression court. <em>Cf. Ballard, </em>420 Md. at 489, 24 A.3d 96 (\"[A] valid waiver 'cannot be established by showing only that [the accused] responded to further police-initiated custodial interrogation.\u2019 Using an accused\u2019s subsequent responses to cast doubt on the adequacy of the initial request <em>itself </em>is even more intolerable.\u201d) (quoting <em>Smith v.

However, under the totality of the circumstances in the case <em>sub judice, </em>and upon our own review of the DVD, we cannot objectively say that Sergeant McDonald\u2019s comments and conduct were so coercive that appellant was prevented, or even discouraged, from invoking his right to silence.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
