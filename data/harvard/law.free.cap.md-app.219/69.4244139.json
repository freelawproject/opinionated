The agreement contained an indemnification provision, which provided that CCBC would indemnify Patient First for any liability arising from negligent acts of CCBC students.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-10\">On January 13, 2007, a CCBC student phlebotomist at a Patient First clinic accidentally stuck herself with a needle and then drew blood from a child using the contaminated needle. As a result of the ensuing lawsuit by the child\u2019s family, Patient First was required to pay $10,000 to settle the case. Patient First sought to enforce the indemnification provision of the agreement to recover its payment, as well as the attorneys\u2019 fees incurred in defending the negligence action. The circuit court found that CCBC breached the agreement by failing to indemnify Patient First for its costs. It awarded $87,097.08, consisting of $10,000 paid toward the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>settlement of the lawsuit and the remainder toward attorneys\u2019 fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-4\">On appeal, CCBC presents two questions for our review, which we have rephrased slightly, as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b95-5\">1. Did the circuit court err in determining that the indemnification provision of the agreement required CCBC to indemnify Patient First for its defense of the negligence action?</p>\n<p id=\"b95-6\">2. Did the circuit court abuse its discretion in allowing testimony regarding the reasonableness of Patient First\u2019s attorneys\u2019 fees, and in awarding attorneys\u2019 fees based on that testimony?</p>\n<p id=\"b95-7\">For the reasons set forth below, we shall affirm the judgment of the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-8\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b95-9\">On September 12, 2003, CCBC and Patient First entered into an Agreement for Clinical Program \u2014 Venipuncture (the \u201cAgreement\u201d). Pursuant to the Agreement, Patient First would provide a \u201csupervised clinical experience\u201d for students in CCBC\u2019s venipuncture program, and CCBC would maintain \u201cprofessional liability insurance that covers the Venipuncture Students and [CCBC] faculty in the Program in the amounts of $1,000,000 per occurrence and $3,000,000 in the aggregate.\u201d The Agreement, which was drafted by CCBC, also contained a section entitled \u201cIndemnification,\u201d which provided, in pertinent part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b95-10\">7.1 [CCBC] will defend, indemnify, and hold [Patient First] harmless from any and all losses, claims, liabilities, damages, costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees) which arise out of the negligent acts or omissions of [CCBC], its agents, employees, or Venipuncture Students in connection with this Agreement.... The obligations of [CCBC] under this subparagraph 7.1 are subject to and limited by its liability under Section 5-301 et [s]eq. [a]nd 5-519, Courts and Judicial Proceedings, Annotated Code of Maryland, as amended.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b96-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>It is further understood and agreed that [CCBC] is not waiving or relinquishing in any manner any defenses that may be available to [CCBC] including, but not limited to, government sovereign immunity or breach of contract or otherwise, nor is [CCBC] relinquishing any defenses that may become available to it at any time during the term of this Agreement, but that [CCBC] is free to assert all defenses that may be available to it at law or in equity.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b96-4\">On January 13, 2007, Morgan Ebaugh, a CCBC student working as a student phlebotomist at a Patient First clinic pursuant to the Agreement, drew blood from a six-year-old patient, Dimitris Politis (\u201cDimitris\u201d), after she first stuck herself with the needle she was using. Ms. Ebaugh subsequently tested positive for Hepatitis C. Dimitris was then tested for a year, but he did not test positive for Hepatitis C.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-5\">On December 14, 2009, Susan Politis, Dimitris\u2019 mother, filed suit, individually and as parent and next friend of Dimitris, against Patient First, Patient First\u2019s affiliates, and Ms. Ebaugh. The complaint asserted that Ms. Ebaugh \u201cacted as an actual and/or apparent agent, servant and employee of\u2019 Patient First. It further asserted that the defendants, including both Patient First and Ms. Ebaugh, owed a duty of care, which included \u201cthe performance of a simple blood draw without injury and the protection of the Plaintiffs from contaminated needles.\u201d On March 16, 2011, the parties reached a settlement agreement, in which Patient First agreed to pay $10,000 toward the $50,000 agreed upon.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-6\">Pursuant to the Agreement, Patient First requested that CCBC indemnify it for Ms. Ebaugh\u2019s negligence and reimburse Patient First for the $10,000 in settlement funds, as well as its attorneys\u2019 fees in defending the lawsuit. CCBC refused Patient First\u2019s request for indemnification.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-7\">Patient First subsequently filed suit for breach of contract, alleging that CCBC\u2019s \u201cfailure to indemnify Patient First as required by Paragraph 7.1 of the Agreement constitutes a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>breach of the Agreement.\u201d <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Patient First sought $88,937.39 in damages, consisting of the $10,000 settlement payment and $78,937.39 in costs and attorneys\u2019 fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-4\">On August 25, 2011, CCBC filed its answer to Patient First\u2019s Amended Complaint, generally denying liability for breach of contract. Although CCBC admitted that the student was negligent, it asserted in its answer that \u201c[t]he contract does not indemnify [Patient First] against its own negligence,\u201d and \u201c[t]o construe the contract to indemnify [Patient First] for its own negligence would violate public policy.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b97-5\">On June 25, 2012, both parties filed motions seeking summary judgment. In its motion, CCBC argued that Patient First was \u201cnot entitled to indemnification for its own admitted negligence,\u201d asserting that Patient First was negligent in supervising Ms. Ebaugh at the time she performed the needle stick on Demitris. It contended that it would be \u201cagainst public policy to uphold Patient First\u2019s breach of contract claim for indemnification for its own admitted negligence and the costs of defending itself from a claim based on that negligence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b97-6\">Patient First argued that \u201cthe plain language of the Agreement require[d] CCBC to indemnify Patient First,\u201d noting that it was undisputed that Ms. Ebaugh was a Venipuncture Student under the Agreement, that she was negligent, and that Patient First incurred losses, costs, and expenses in defending the lawsuit that resulted from Ms. Ebaugh\u2019s negligence. It disagreed with CCBC\u2019s argument that it was not entitled to indemnification because of negligence in supervising Ms. Ebaugh, asserting that Paragraph 7.1 of the Agree<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>ment \u201cdoes not except circumstances where Patient First is allegedly negligent.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b98-4\">On August 24, 2012, the court denied both motions, noting that, although it was undisputed that Ms. Ebaugh \u201cperformed a negligent act\u201d while working as a student phlebotomist at Patient First, it was not \u201csufficiently clear as to whether there was negligence or not in supervision of [Ms.] Ebaugh at the time she was negligent in performing a vein puncture.\u201d The court concluded that, because there was \u201ca dispute of material facts,\u201d and due to the \u201cabsence of specifics sufficient to allow [it] to conclude that either party is correct in its assertions,\u201d summary judgment was not proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-5\">On January 11, 2013, Patient First filed a motion in limine to \u201cexclude any evidence or legal argument by [CCBC] that Patient First\u2019s claims are barred because of its own negligence.\u201d It asserted that CCBC \u201ccould not point to any facts that constituted Patient First\u2019s negligence other than its alleged failure to supervise [Ms.] Ebaugh \u2014 which was not required by the parties\u2019 Agreement.\u201d It argued that any negligence on its part was not relevant, and in any event, CCBC could not prove that it was negligent, asserting that expert testimony is required to establish negligence, and CCBC had \u201cfailed to identify any expert.\u201d Patient First argued that, without expert testimony that it was negligent, CCBC should be excluded from introducing evidence or legal argument in that regard.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b98-6\">Trial began on April 10, 2013. Melanie Mendoza, the Medical Director of the Patient First facility where Ms. Ebaugh performed the needle stick on Dimitris, ordered blood work to be performed on Dimitris during his visit on January 13, 2007.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> She informed Ms. Politis that someone would come to draw the blood, and she left the room to see other patients. Dr. Mendoza\u2019s expectation was that a \u201clab person\u201d who was a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>Patient First employee would come to the room and draw Dimitris\u2019 blood.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-4\">Because the results of the blood test were taking a while, Dr. Mendoza returned to the examination room to check with Ms. Politis regarding whether blood had been drawn. Ms. Politis informed Dr. Mendoza that, during the blood draw, the phlebotomist stuck herself with the needle she was attempting to use on Dimitris. Dr. Mendoza went to the lab, where she learned that Ms. Ebaugh was the person who attempted Dimitris\u2019 blood draw. Prior to visiting the lab, Dr. Mendoza was unaware that there was a student phlebotomist working that day.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-5\">When Dr. Mendoza asked what had happened during the blood draw, Ms. Ebaugh told her that she used a butterfly needle and \u201cgrazed herself\u2019 with the needle. She saw blood on the needle, so she threw it away and used a second needle to attempt once again to draw Dimitris\u2019 blood, but she was unsuccessful. Dr. Mendoza returned to the room and told Ms. Politis what she learned from Ms. Ebaugh. Ms. Politis told Dr. Mendoza that she only saw Ms. Ebaugh use one needle. Dr. Mendoza then checked the needle box in the examination room and found only one needle inside.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-6\">After Dr. Mendoza informed Ms. Ebaugh that she had observed only one needle in the needle box, Ms. Ebaugh admitted that she had used the same needle that she stuck herself with on Dimitris. At Dr. Mendoza\u2019s direction, Ms. Ebaugh obtained a blood test. She tested positive for Hepatitis C. Dr. Mendoza did not know whether Dimitris was tested for Hepatitis C.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-7\">On cross-examination, Dr. Mendoza agreed that performing a blood draw on a six-year-old child \u201cis much more difficult than doing a blood draw on an adult,\u201d and it required experience. Dr. Mendoza felt confident when she ordered the blood draw that \u201cwhoever draws the blood knows what they are doing drawing the blood.\u201d It was her understanding that student phlebotomists working at Patient First were supervised by Patient First lab technicians when they performed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>blood draws, and \u201cthe lab techs and nurses and medical assistants are there to supervise them and help them.\u201d Dr. Mendoza testified that she was not responsible for supervising Ms. Ebaugh.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b100-4\">Lisa Baldwin, Director of Training for Patient First, signed the Agreement. She explained that, under the Agreement, Patient First did not agree to supervise or observe \u201ceach and every needle stick.\u201d With respect to supervision of CCBC students, Ms. Baldwin explained Patient First\u2019s policies and practices as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b100-5\">[W]hen we got a student from [CCBC], we would have the student observe the person that was working with them for phlebotomy sticks and then we would ... observe the student while they performed the phlebotomy sticks. Once the student was deemed competent, then we would allow the student to then go and perform venipunctures and they were to come back to us if they had any issues, and they could go to the medical assistants, the nurses, lab.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b100-6\">Based on the indemnification provision of the Agreement contained in Paragraph 7.1, Ms. Baldwin understood that if a CCBC student \u201chad any issues or caused any problems, that the school would be held responsible and deal with all of those issues.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b100-7\">Stephen McCoy, Vice President and General Counsel for Patient First, testified that, after being served with the complaint filed by Ms. Politis in January 2010, Patient First retained counsel, Hancock, Daniel, Johnson, <em>&amp; </em>Nagle, P.C. (the \u201cHancock Firm\u201d), to defend it in the litigation. After the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>Politis litigation was resolved via settlement in January 2011, the firm sent Patient First a bill for $87,097.08, which included $10,000 for Patient First\u2019s portion of the settlement and $77,097.08 for attorneys\u2019 fees and costs. Mr. McCoy stated that the amount Patient First was billed and paid was \u201cslightly less\u201d than the amount sought as damages in Patient First\u2019s complaint. Patient First paid the bill.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-4\">On cross-examination, Mr. McCoy agreed that the complaint in the Politis litigation alleged that Patient First was negligent in supervising Ms. Ebaugh. Accordingly, the settlement funds, attorneys\u2019 fees, and costs associated with the litigation were expended in order to defend against the allegation that Patient First\u2019s negligence caused Dimitris\u2019 damages. In the settlement agreement reached in the Politis litigation, Patient First did not admit liability and denied all allegations of negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-5\">At the conclusion of Patient First\u2019s case, CCBC moved for judgment on the grounds alleged in its motion for summary judgment. The court denied CCBC\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-6\">CCBC\u2019s first witness was Lane Miller, Coordinator of Allied Health for CCBC. As coordinator, Mr. Miller oversaw the phlebotomy program, and one of his duties included setting up clinical assignments for students. He was responsible for contacting local healthcare providers to inquire whether they would participate in a program providing clinical experience to CCBC phlebotomy students. He contacted Patient First regarding a potential partnership and met with Ms. Baldwin.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-7\">Before the Agreement was signed, Mr. Miller met with Ms. Baldwin twice, during which they discussed the type of supervision that would be provided to CCBC students. The first few days of the clinical externship, CCBC students would shadow Patient First staff, and then, once the student was accomplished and the site supervisor was confident with that student, \u201cthe student would then begin to do their own blood draws with the direct supervision from Patient First.\u201d After the supervisor observed the student, \u201cthe student could then work independently.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b102-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>Mr. Miller and Ms. Baldwin also discussed \u201chard sticks,\u201d which referred to blood draws for \u201cany children under the age of ten, any elderly patient and any obese patient because it\u2019s typically harder to get a successful draw from those patients.\u201d Mr. Miller\u2019s understanding from his conversations with Ms. Baldwin was that CCBC students would not do a hard stick, or \u201cif a decision was made that a hard stick was to be drawn by our [student], that they would have a direct supervisor over their shoulder in case there [were] any complications.\u201d This understanding was not put in writing.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-4\">Mr. Miller believed that the supervision arrangement he described at trial was what was meant by the term \u201csupervised clinical experience\u201d in Paragraph 1.1 of the Agreement. On cross-examination, he clarified that it was not his understanding that Patient First promised that a Patient First employee would observe \u201ceach and every needle stick.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b102-5\">Students participating in the CCBC program were required to work 80 hours and perform at least 100 successful needle sticks. Ms. Ebaugh was scheduled to work at Patient First Monday through Friday, from 5:00 p.m. to 10:00 p.m., and one weekend shift. At the time of the Politis incident, Ms. Ebaugh had completed 25-30 hours at Patient First. After the incident, Ms. Ebaugh sent an e-mail to Mr. Miller stating that she did not wish to continue with the phlebotomy program. She did not respond to his requests that she come in and discuss the incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-6\">Michelle Jancewski, Director of Health and Human Services and Workforce Development at CCBC, supervised Mr. Miller when he was in charge of the phlebotomy program. With respect to CCBC\u2019s Agreement with Patient First, her understanding was that Patient First \u201cwould supervise the student so that the student and patient were safe,\u201d and that CCBC students would not perform difficult needle sticks. She understood that Patient First employees would supervise CCBC students performing ordinary needle sticks. She acknowledged, however, that CCBC admitted, in response to Patient First\u2019s request for admissions, that \u201cPatient First had no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>contractual obligation to [CCBC] to personally observe the students during needle sticks.\u201d She also acknowledged that, during her deposition as a corporate designee of CCBC, she agreed that the Patient First clinical sites came up with then-own guidelines for supervision, depending on the patient.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-4\">Charles Andrews, an adjunct faculty member at CCBC, testified that he taught phlebotomy courses at the college, and Ms. Ebaugh was one of his students. In his experience as a preceptor, he had never allowed a venipuncture student to do a blood draw on a six-year-old child.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-5\">Melissa Hopp, CCBC\u2019s Vice President of Administrative Services, testified that, pursuant to the Agreement, CCBC obtained professional liability insurance for its students participating in the program. After the Politis lawsuit was filed, CCBC notified the insurer, and the \u201c[insurance kicked in to defend [Ms.] Ebaugh.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b103-6\">As a result of the lawsuit, Ms. Hopp received a letter from Patient First asking CCBC to indemnify it for its costs in defending the lawsuit. Ms. Hopp spoke with Patient First\u2019s counsel, and she advised that they would not indemnify Patient First. She explained that indemnification was not required because \u201cwe judged that they were negligent\u201d in their supervision of Ms. Ebaugh, \u201cand they were asking us to pay for their negligence.\u201d It was her understanding that, pursuant to the Agreement, Patient First was to \u201csupervise [CCBC] students, to observe and instruct them and to prevent those students from committing errors or ... from being unsafe.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b103-7\">At the conclusion of CCBC\u2019s case, counsel for CCBC read into evidence Patient First\u2019s answer to a question in CCBC\u2019s first set of interrogatories, in which CCBC asked if Ms. Ebaugh was under supervision by any agent, servant, or employee of Patient First Corporation at the time of the incident alleged in the lawsuit filed by Susan Politis. Patient First responded: \u201cAt the time of the Politis incident, [Ms.] Ebaugh was under the general supervision of Dr. Mendoza.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b103-8\">Prior to issuing its ruling, the court heard closing argument from the parties. Patient First argued that the indemnifica<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>tion provision in Paragraph 7.1 clearly applied because the Politis lawsuit against Patient First was based on Ms. Ebaugh\u2019s negligence. With respect to CCBC\u2019s argument that Patient First was negligent in supervising Ms. Ebaugh, it argued that there was \u201cno sufficient allegation in the Politis Complaint that stands alone as a negligence claim against Patient First independent of [Ms.] Ebaugh\u2019s actions in sticking the child with the same needle.\u201d Patient First contended that, without expert testimony establishing its negligence, there was no basis on which the court could determine that Patient First was prohibited from enforcing the indemnification provision due to its own negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-4\">CCBC argued that, pursuant to Paragraph 7.1 of the Agreement, which provided that CCBC was not waiving any defenses to Patient First\u2019s claim for indemnification, it could successfully defend against Patient First\u2019s claim based on Patient First\u2019s own negligence in supervising Ms. Ebaugh. Specifically, it asserted that it was \u201cblack letter law\u201d that a party was not required to indemnify another party for its own negligence. CCBC contended that the Politis complaint was based on Patient First\u2019s own negligence, as well as Ms. Ebaugh\u2019s, and if Patient First had employed the proper supervision, \u201cwe wouldn\u2019t be standing here today because [Ms.] Ebaugh would not have been allowed to do the draw.\u201d CCBC asserted that the testimony of Dr. Mendoza, the person responsible for supervising Ms. Ebaugh, that she was unaware that a student phlebotomist was in the building, \u201cends the case right there.\u201d The court ruled in favor of Patient First, explaining its ruling as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b104-5\">When you look at this cause of action, the broadest reading of the Complaint that was filed, alleges very clearly negligence on the part of the student and nobody disputes that, and it alleges liability on the part of Patient First for respondeat superior because the student was their actual or apparent agent and I think that still would fall within the indemnification____ But the indemnification piece really depends on ... where the liability rests. It\u2019s not just what was alleged but what\u2019s the basis for liability.... So it comes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>down to me whether there was adequate proof in this case that there was an independent breach of, you know, a duty by Patient First.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b105-4\">With respect to CCBC\u2019s argument that \u201cthere was a failure to supervise and clearly that\u2019s what caused this,\u201d the court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b105-5\">[T]his Agreement was very non-specific about what the supervised clinic was supposed to be, and everybody who looked at it after the fact had a slightly different view of what supervised meant, including the people who were operating in the clinic at times, but there was no meeting of the minds or understanding of what the supervision obligation is for venipuncture students in a Patient First clinic.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b105-6\">The court agreed with Patient First that, to determine whether Patient First breached the appropriate standard of care, \u201csome expertise\u201d was required because it was not \u201capparent on [the] face\u201d of the Agreement. Because the court did not \u201cknow what the standard is,\u201d it could not \u201cindependently determine whether Patient First breached it,\u201d and \u201c[t]hat leaves me with liability being established based upon the breach by [Ms.] Ebaugh herself but a question mark as to whether the evidence is sufficient to show a breach by Patient First.\u201d The court concluded: \u201cFor that reason, all Pm left with is something that clearly falls under the Indemnification Provision in this contract.\u201d Accordingly, it awarded Patient First \u201cthe $87,097.08[,] which was the $10,000 paid in settlement plus the attorney\u2019s fees in the third party action.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b105-7\">On April 30, 2013, the court filed a written order reflecting its oral ruling. This timely appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-8\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b105-9\">We review a bench trial \u201con both the law and the evidence,\u201d and we \u201cwill not set aside the judgment of the trial court on the evidence unless clearly erroneous, and will give due regard to the opportunity of the trial court to judge the credibility of the witnesses.\u201d Md. Rule 8 \u2014 131(c). \u201c \u2018A factual finding is clearly erroneous if there is no competent and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>material evidence in the record to support it.\u2019 \u201d <em>Hillsmere Shores Improvement Ass\u2019n, Inc. v. Singleton, </em>182 Md.App. 667, 690, 959 A.2d 130 (2008) (quoting <em>Hoang v.

Woods, </em>353 Md. 425, 447, 727 A.2d 358 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b106-4\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b106-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-6\">Indemnification Provision</p>\n<p id=\"b106-7\">CCBC contends that \u201cthe circuit court erred as a matter of law in awarding Patient First indemnification damages,\u201d asserting that a party can recover contractual indemnity for its legally culpable conduct only if the contract contains clear and unequivocal language indemnifying the party for its own negligence, which the Agreement here did not do. It argues that the circuit court erroneously put the burden of showing Patient First\u2019s negligence on CCBC, asserting that Patient First had the burden to show that CCBC had a contractual obligation to indemnify it for its own loss.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-8\">Patient First acknowledges that, in the absence of unequivocal language, there generally is a presumption against indemnification for a service provider\u2019s own negligence. It contends, however, that the circuit court properly ruled in its favor for two reasons. First, it argues that, before reaching the issue of whether the presumption against indemnification applied, CCBC had to prove that Patient First was negligent, which it failed to do in the absence of expert testimony regarding the standard of care. Second, it argues that, even if CCBC did prove that Patient First was negligent, based solely <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>on the allegations in the Politis Lawsuit, the presumption against indemnification for a party\u2019s own negligence is inapplicable here because there was no evidence that CCBC \u201cwas the type of unwary or uninformed Indemnitor that the presumption was designed to protect,\u201d and the language used in the Agreement was sufficient to show that it applied to the provider\u2019s own negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-4\">Initially, we note that CCBC does not dispute that Ms. Ebaugh was negligent, and under the plain language of the Agreement, CCBC would be required to indemnify Patient First for Ms. Ebaugh\u2019s negligence. CCBC contends, however, that there is an exception to this requirement, relying on its assertion that Patient First was negligent in its supervision of Ms. Ebaugh and the general rule that \u201c \u2018contracts will not be construed to indemnify a person against his own negligence unless an intention so to do is expressed in those very words</p>\n<p id=\"ALJ\">or in other unequivocal terms.\u2019 \u201d <em>Kreter v. HealthSTAR Communications, Inc., </em>172 Md.App. 243, 254, 914 A.2d 168 (2007) (quoting <em>Crockett v. Crothers, </em>264 Md. 222, 227, 285 A.2d 612 (1972)). <em>Accord Heat &amp; Power Corp. v. Air Products &amp; Chemicals, Inc., </em>320 Md. 584, 593, 578 A.2d 1202 (1990) (where \u201ccontract did not expressly or unequivocally indemnify [the plaintiff] against its own negligence, the circuit court judge was correct in ruling as a matter of law that [the defendant] had no contractual duty to indemnify [the plaintiff]\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b107-5\">The contract here did not contain express language that CCBC would indemnify Patient First for its own negligence.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>Before CCBC can rely on the presumption against indemnification for the indemnitee\u2019s own negligence, however, there must be a determination whether Patient First was negligent. In determining this question, a critical issue is who had the burden to prove the negligence or lack of negligence of Patient First.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-4\">Although there does not appear to be a Maryland case directly on point, other courts have addressed the issue and held that, where an indemnitor seeks to deny payment on the ground that the indemnitee was negligent, that is an affirmative defense that the indemnitor must prove. <em>See Norddeutscher Lloyd v. Jones Stevedoring Co., </em>490 F.2d 648, 649 (9th Cir.1973) (indemnitor bore burden of proof of establishing that indemnitee\u2019s negligence precluded its recovery under indemnification agreement); <em>Grubb &amp; Ellis Mgmt. Sews., Inc. v. 407417 B.C., L.L.C., </em>213 Ariz. 83, 138 P.3d 1210, 1215 (Ariz.Ct.App.2006) (\u201c[Indemnitor\u2019s] contention that [indemnitee] was grossly negligent is in the nature of an affirmative defense,\u201d and \u201c[t]he proponent of an affirmative defense has the burden of pleading and proving it.\u201d); <em>N. Little Rock Elec. Co. v. Pickens-Bond Const. Co., </em>253 Ark. 172, 485 S.W.2d 197, 199 (1972) (where indemnitor asserted \u201cthe affirmative defense that [the indemnittee] was guilty of negligence,\u201d the court noted the absence of \u201csatisfactory authority which would place the burden on [the indemnittee] to establish that they were free of negligence\u201d); <em>Tesoro Petroleum Corp. v. Nabors Drilling USA Inc., </em>106 S.W.3d 118, 126 (Tex.App.2002) (\u201cA claim that a contractual exclusion precludes indemnity is an affirmative defense.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b109-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>We agree with this analysis. We hold that an indemnitor who seeks to avoid payment under an indemnity agreement, based on the presumption against indemnification for a party\u2019s own negligence, has the burden to prove the indemnitee\u2019s negligence. Accordingly, the circuit court properly focused on whether CCBC established that Patient First was negligent.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-4\">In finding that CCBC failed to show that Patient First was negligent, the court found that there was not a meeting of the minds between the parties regarding the supervision requirement. It stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b109-5\">CCBC\u2019s argument ... is that there was a failure to supervise .... and for me to then figure out what is the standard of care in that context and whether it was breached ... requires something other than individual people\u2019s opinions on what it should be[.] [I]t required some expertise because it\u2019s not something that\u2019s apparent on its face.... I don\u2019t know what the standard is and, therefore, I can\u2019t independently determine whether Patient First breached it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b109-6\"> We agree with the circuit court\u2019s analysis. Expert testimony generally is required to establish a professional standard of care for a negligence claim, unless the negligence is obviously proven. <em>Schultz v. Bank of America N.A., </em>413 Md. 15, 19, 990 A.2d 1078 (2010). The party alleging negligence \u201c \u2018bears the burden of overcoming the presumption that due skill and care were used.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 29, 990 A.2d 1078 (quoting <em>Crockett v. Crothers, </em>264 Md. 222, 224, 285 A.2d 612 (1972)).</p>\n<p id=\"b109-7\">We are not persuaded by CCBC\u2019s argument that the allegations in the Politis lawsuit that Patient First was negligent were sufficient to meet CCBC\u2019s burden of proof. <em>See Tesoro Petroleum Corp., </em>106 S.W.3d at 125 (\u201cFacts ... not allegations, determine an indemnitor\u2019s duty to indemnify. The duty to defend may be triggered by the pleadings, but the duty to indemnify is based on the jury\u2019s findings.\u201d). Without a jury finding that Patient First was negligent, or any other evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>of Patient First\u2019s negligence, the circuit court properly found that CCBC was required to indemnify Patient First.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b110-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-5\">Damages</p>\n<p id=\"b110-6\">CCBC next argues that the circuit court abused its discretion in allowing Mr. McCoy, Patient First\u2019s General Counsel, \u201cto testify about the reasonableness of the Hancock firm\u2019s fees, and it clearly erred in awarding $77,097.08 in attorneys\u2019 fees based on that deficient testimony.\u201d In support, it argues that Mr. McCoy was not identified, or qualified, as an expert, but the court allowed him to \u201cexpress an opinion as to whether the bill [was] reasonable.\u201d It asserts that Mr. McCoy\u2019s \u201cscant and conclusory opinion testimony\u201d was insufficient to prove that Patient First was entitled to attorneys\u2019 fees where there was no testimony regarding the reasonableness of the rates charged or the work done.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-7\">Patient First argues that Mr. McCoy \u201cwas competent to testify to the reasonableness of the Hancock fees,\u201d and \u201cthe trial court did not err in awarding such fees.\u201d It contends that it \u201cproduced sufficient testimony and documentation\u201d on which the circuit court \u201ccould rely to evaluate the reasonableness of the Hancock fees.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b110-8\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-9\">Proceedings Below</p>\n<p id=\"b110-10\">During Mr. McCoy\u2019s direct examination regarding the bill Patient First paid to the Hancock firm, counsel for Patient First asked him whether \u201ca total invoice of $77,000 [was] reasonable\u201d in his \u201copinion as general counsel of Patient First.\u201d Counsel for CCBC objected on the following grounds: (1) \u201cMr. McCoy was never identified as an expert witness previously\u201d; and (2) Mr. McCoy could not testify that the fee <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>he paid in litigation in which he was a plaintiff was reasonable. With respect to the second ground, the court stated that there was \u201cnothing about the fact that he\u2019s a plaintiff that ... precludes him from testifying to the fairness and reasonableness of the bill.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b111-4\">Counsel for Patient First argued that it did not need to admit Mr. McCoy as an expert, asserting that, in order to prove damages, it only needed to \u201cestablish that the amounts were invoiced and ... paid,\u201d and it was in the court\u2019s discretion to determine whether those amounts were reasonable. The court noted that it could not make such a determination absent testimony, but that, \u201cas the general counsel, [Mr. McCoy] can express an opinion as to whether the bill was reasonable.\u201d The court overruled CCBC\u2019s objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-5\">Mr. McCoy then testified that, in his experience with Patient First, the bill represented \u201ca reasonable and customary amount for a lawsuit that proceeds through depositions, a mediation and to a settlement.\u201d An itemized list of the Hancock firm\u2019s fees was admitted as an exhibit during trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-6\">At the conclusion of trial, both parties presented arguments regarding the damage award. The court noted that Patient First\u2019s burden was to prove \u201cnot just that a fee was incurred but the fairness and reasonableness.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b111-7\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-8\">Attorneys\u2019 Fee Portion of Damage Award</p>\n<p id=\"b111-9\">The indemnification language contained in Paragraph 7.1 of the Agreement expressly provided that CCBC \u201cwill defend, indemnify, and hold [Patient First] harmless from any and all losses, claims, liabilities, damages, costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees)\u201d for claims that arise out of the negligence of a CCBC student. Accordingly, the plain language of the Agreement provided that Patient First was entitled to indemnification for its attorneys\u2019 fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-10\">\u201cWhen an award of attorneys\u2019 fees is \u2018based on a contractual right, the losing party is \u201centitled to have the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>amount of fees and expenses proven with the certainty and under the standards ordinarily applicable for proof of contractual damages.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>B &amp; P Enterprises, </em>133 Md.App. 583, 624, 758 A.2d 1026 (1999) (citations omitted).

A circuit court\u2019s determination regarding the reasonableness of attorneys\u2019 fees \u201c \u2018is a factual determination within the sound discretion of the court, and will not be overturned unless clearly erroneous.\u2019 \u201d <em>Carroll Indep.

The itemization included the date, the amount of time, the attorney, the attorney\u2019s rate, and description of the task for each task completed in connection with the Politis Lawsuit. Mr. McCoy testified that, in his experience as General Counsel for Patient First, the fees charged were reasonable. This evidence was sufficient to establish the reasonableness of the fees. <em>See Zachair Ltd. v.
