The circuit court denied the writ, but stayed Burton\u2019s extradition until the conclusion of this timely appeal. Burton submits one question for our review, which we have rephrased into the following two questions:<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b701-5\">1. Did the circuit court err in denying Burton\u2019s Writ of Habeas Corpus because it incorrectly applied the <em>Doran </em>requirements<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b701-6\">2. Did the circuit court err by dismissing Burton\u2019s Constitutional and Maryland Declaration of Rights claims?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b701-7\">For the following reasons, we shall affirm the judgment of the circuit court.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b701-8\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b701-9\">On June 15, 2012, the Worcester County police found in a wooded area near the Delaware-Maryland border the body, later identified as Nicole Bennett, a missing Delaware resident. Through investigation, Maryland authorities came to believe that Burton was responsible for Mrs. Bennett\u2019s death and charged him with first- and second-degree murder. Because Burton was a resident of Delaware, Maryland Governor Martin O\u2019Malley submitted an application for requisition to Delaware Governor Jack Markell, who, in turn, issued a Governor\u2019s Warrant of Rendition for Burton. Delaware authorities apprehended Burton in Sussex County, Delaware on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"680\">*680</page-number>August 6, 2012. After failing to obtain habeas corpus relief in Delaware, Burton was transported to Worcester County.</p>\n<p id=\"A7P\">A Maryland grand jury indicted Burton on crimes related to Mrs. Bennett\u2019s death including murder, rape, and kidnapping.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The State of Maryland notified Burton that it would be seeking the death penalty, but, when Maryland repealed the death penalty in 2013, that notice was withdrawn.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-6\">On May 31, 2013, the State\u2019s Attorney for Worcester County wrote Burton\u2019s counsel:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b702-7\">Please find attached copy of a letter dated May 8, 2013 from the Delaware Department of Justice regarding the above referenced criminal matter.[<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b702-8\">Based upon recent discussion with other interested jurisdictions it has been determined that the Delaware Department of Justice will indict and prosecute your client on charges related to the kidnapping, rape, and murder of Nicole Bennett on June 14, 2012. The Delaware Department of Justice has expressed their intent to initiate a capital prosecution against the Defendant. Any prosecution by Delaware will supersede the current criminal case in the State of Maryland.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b703-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"681\">*681</page-number>This criminal matter may be concluded in the State of Maryland should the Defendant agree to the following conditions:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b703-5\">2. The Court will impose the following binding sentences:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b703-6\">a. As to the Count One, First Degree Murder, the Defendant will receive a sentence of Life without the Possibility of Parole, consecutive to any other sentence previously imposed upon the Defendant in Worcester County, Maryland or in any other jurisdiction;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b703-7\">b. As to Count Three, First Degree Rape, the Defendant will receive a sentence of Life without the Possibility of Parole, consecutive to Count One and consecutive to any other sentence previously imposed upon the Defendant in Worcester County, Maryland or in any other jurisdiction....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b703-8\">If your client fully accepts each and every term and condition of this letter please sign and have your client sign the original and return it to the State no later than noon on July 1, 2013 at which time this offer will expire....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b703-9\">Burton rejected the plea offer, and on August 12, 2013, the State nol prossed<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> all pending charges in Maryland.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-10\">Seven days later, a Delaware grand jury indicted Burton on two counts of first-degree murder and one count of first-degree rape related to Mrs. Bennett\u2019s death. On September 25, 2013, Governor Markell submitted an application for requisition to Governor O\u2019Malley. That submission included (1) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"682\">*682</page-number>Governor Markell\u2019s signed application for requisition along with the sworn statement of Deputy Attorney General Elizabeth R. MacFarlan, (2) a docket sheet, (3) a grand jury indictment, (4) a warrant for Burton\u2019s arrest, <em>(5) </em>the Delaware Attorney General\u2019s Identification Report including a fingerprint card, and (6) an annexed application for requisition, which included an application for requisition signed by Governor Markell, representations by Deputy Attorney General Elizabeth R. MacFarlan, and copies of the Delaware Code concerning murder and rape. Governor O\u2019Malley signed a Governor\u2019s Warrant of Rendition for Burton on October 28, 2013.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-5\">As authorized by Maryland Code (2001, 2008 Repl. Vol.), \u00a7 9-110 of the Criminal Procedure Article (\u201cC.P.\u201d), Burton filed a Writ of Habeas Corpus challenging his extradition to Delaware. At a November 4, 2013 hearing, the circuit court held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b704-6\">The case of Michigan versus Doran ... limitfs] the Court\u2019s [consideration to] four items: ... whether the extradition documents on their face are in order. There\u2019s been argument, primarily the argument has been the identification ... isn\u2019t good enough, it said Wicomico instead of Worcester, even though I have the file here and everyone knew it was Worcester. I quite frankly find that to be equivalent to a typo. It\u2019s what the case referred to as a minor irregularity and I find \u2014 both arguments that [Burton has] made on that issue being minor irregularities.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b704-7\">Whether the Petitioner has been charged with a crime in the demanding state.... Of course he had been charged with two counts of first degree murder and one count of first degree rape.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b704-8\">[T]he third one is whether the petitioner is the person named in the request for extradition. And I find the arguments that were made in that regard are without merit, it\u2019s almost desperate. There\u2019s no requirement about finger<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"683\">*683</page-number>prints.... We have an affidavit in the file saying he\u2019s who he is, it\u2019s signed by him .... it\u2019s just without merit. Whether the Petitioner is a fugitive.... Under the extradition ... definition ... if you\u2019re in another state and charged with a crime from another state you\u2019re a fugitive.... [Y]ou don\u2019t have to sneak over here. And the fact that he came over here against his will ... makes no difference as far as the extradition process goes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b705-5\">So on those four [Burton] loses.... But I do want to go just a little bit further and address these arguments.... [Burton argues that] [t]he prosecution[\u2019]s attempt to extradite [him] back to Delaware is vindictive and violated the due process clause of the United States Constitution and the Maryland Declaration of Rights.... You could draw the conclusion that it\u2019s vindictive. But it\u2019s a guess, it\u2019s simply a guess. There\u2019s been no offer of proof or anything, it\u2019s just that, well, you\u2019ve got this letter, and you know, we\u2019ve had numerous hearing[s] and motions, we\u2019ve had three trial dates set. So in the meantime Maryland did away with the death penalty and Delaware still has theirs and that\u2019s the only reason it\u2019s being sent there is because ... they want to subject [Burton] to the death penalty.... [T]hat\u2019s a good argument I suppose, but all it is is [Burton\u2019s] suggestion of what it indicates to [him], it\u2019s really nothing else. So [Burton] lose[s] on that argument....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b705-6\">[Burton contends that his] extradition ... violated the Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution and Articlefs] of the Maryland Declaration of Rights. And again, I think this had to do with the death penalty and the vindictiveness and all and I\u2019ve addressed that. So really it\u2019s the same argument, it\u2019s just their raising it to a constitutional level. But for all of the same reasons the Court rules against [Burton] on that argument....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b705-7\">[Burton asserts that] the State of Maryland is legally bound to its previous statements and is collaterally estopped from now adopting an inconsistent position. Actually, if you want <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"684\">*684</page-number>to get technical about it, they\u2019re not. They nolle prossed the case. It\u2019s no longer in existence, and what we\u2019re doing now is we\u2019re arguing what the State of Delaware is alleging who\u2019s the one now trying to get [Burton] back there to prosecute him. So I don\u2019t find any merit in [that] argument</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b706-5\">[The State argues that that constitutional claims are] not within the permissible scope of the habeas corpus hearing; he may be right, but I addressed [them] anyway. Even if permissible the argument is without merit and not supported by any authority. I\u2019ve addressed that and I agree....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b706-6\">[The State] says minor irregularities ... minor defects in the wording or discrepancies between charging papers and the requisition do not affect the asylum state\u2019s action. In other words, to be considered problems of the demanding state. And that\u2019s sort of what I\u2019ve alluded to a couple of times ... A lot of these arguments seem more appropriately raised in Delaware than here, and undoubtedly as [Burton\u2019s] counsel suggests they will be raised there ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b706-7\">[T]he former application for requisition was made by the State of Maryland, not the State of Delaware, therefore, there\u2019s been no former application for requisition but that demanding state which is something I\u2019ve already alluded to and I agree. That there was no delay in the prosecution of the said crime and the application of a requisition. Being [that Delaware] just recently charged him in Delaware with these crimes, I\u2019ll have to agree with that, but undoubtedly that is going to be a very serious argument to be raised in Delaware.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b706-8\">The circuit court denied the writ, but, at Burton\u2019s request, later ordered a stay of his extradition pending this timely appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"Abl\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"685\">*685</page-number>DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b707-5\">Modern interstate extradition proceedings arise out of the Extradition Clause of the United States Constitution:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b707-6\">A Person charged in any State with Treason, Felony, or other Crime, who shall flee from Justice, and be found in another State shall on Demand of the executive Authority of the State from which he fled, be delivered up to be removed to the State having Jurisdiction of the Crime.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b707-7\">U.S. Const. art. IV \u00a7 2, cl. 2. The United States Supreme Court has explained the purpose and intent of the Extradition Clause:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b707-8\">The Extradition Clause was intended to enable each state to bring offenders to trial as swiftly as possible in the state where the alleged offense was committed. The purpose of the Clause was to preclude any state from becoming a sanctuary for fugitives from justice of another state and thus \u201cbalkanize\u201d the administration of criminal justice among the several states. It articulated, in mandatory language, the concepts of comity and full faith and credit, found in the immediately preceding clause of Art. IV. The Extradition Clause, like the Commerce Clause served important national objectives of a newly developing country striving to foster national unity. In the administration of justice, no less than in trade and commerce, national unity was thought to be served by de-emphasizing state lines for certain purposes, without impinging on essential state autonomy.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b707-9\">Interstate extradition was intended to be a summary and mandatory executive proceeding derived from the language of Art. IV, \u00a7 2, cl. 2, of the Constitution. The Clause never contemplated that the asylum state was to conduct the kind of preliminary inquiry traditionally intervening between the initial arrest and trial.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b707-10\"><em>Doran, </em>439 U.S. at 287-88, 99 S.Ct. 530 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b707-11\">Because the Extradition Clause was not self-executing, Congress enacted the Act of 1793, which outlined the procedural requisites of interstate extradition proceedings. 18 U.S.C. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"686\">*686</page-number>\u00a7 3182 (2012).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> States began to adopt their own variations of the Act of 1793, and inconsistency among the states prompted the National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws to adopt the Uniform Criminal Extradition Act in 1926. <em>Report of the Standing Committee on Uniform State Laws, </em>49 Annu.

Vol.) \u00a7 9-114 of the Criminal Procedure Article (\u201cC.P.\u201d), Maryland\u2019s extradition law has only endured stylistic alterations and is now codified in C.P. \u00a7\u00a7 9-101-9-128.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"687\">*687</page-number>Extradition is essentially an executive process, but the judiciary does have a limited role when considering Writs of Habeas Corpus arising from extradition proceedings. The <em>Doran </em>Court held that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b709-5\">a court considering release on habeas corpus [in an extradition proceeding] <em>can do no more than </em>decide (a) whether the extradition documents on their face are in order; (b) whether the petitioner has been charged with a crime in the demanding state; (c) whether the petitioner is the person named in the request for extradition; and (d) whether the petitioner is a fugitive. These are historic facts readily verifiable.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b709-6\"><em>Doran, </em>439 U.S. at 289, 99 S.Ct. 530 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b709-7\">A court begins its inquiry with the presumption that \u201conce a governor has granted extradition, ... there is prima facie evidence that constitutional and statutory requirements have been met.\u201d <em>Doran, </em>439 U.S. at 289, 99 S.Ct. 530. The Court of Appeals has likewise opined that the Governor\u2019s issuance of a Warrant of Rendition, \u201craises [the] presumption that the accused is the fugitive wanted and [the warrant] is sufficient to justify his arrest, detention[,] and delivery to the demanding state.\u201d <em>Solomon v. Warden, Baltimore City Jail, </em>256 Md. 297, 300-01, 260 A.2d 68 (1969) (citations omitted); <em>see also Bryson v. Warden, Baltimore City Jail, </em>287 Md. 467, 470, 413 A.2d 554 (1980). And, as this Court has stated, there is a presumption that when the Governor grants extradition, the Governor\u2019s Warrant of Rendition and all documents accompanying the original demand are in order. <em>Roscoe v. Warden, Baltimore City Jail, </em>23 Md.App. 516, 521-22, 328 A.2d 64 (1974). To rebut the presumptions that the constitutional and statutory requirements have been met, and receive habeas corpus relief, the accused must \u201cprove beyond a reasonable doubt either that he was not present in the demanding state at the time of the alleged offense or that he was not the person named in the warrant....\u201d <em>Solomon, </em>256 Md. at 300-01, 260 A.2d 68. This requires \u201c \u2018overwhelming evidence,\u2019 \u201d not mere contradictory evidence. <em>Id. </em>at 301, 260 A.2d 68 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"688\">*688</page-number>(citing <em>Mason v. Warden, </em>203 Md. 659, 661, 99 A.2d 739 (1953)).</p>\n<p id=\"b710-4\">Burton\u2019s challenges to the circuit court\u2019s denial of his Writ of Habeas Corpus rest on two contentions: (1) that the circuit court erred in its application of the <em>Doran </em>requirements; and (2) that the extradition proceedings in this case have violated his due process rights and rights against cruel and unusual punishment under the United States Constitution and the Maryland Declaration of Rights. We will address his claims in that order.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-5\">\n<em>Whether the extradition documents are on their face in order</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b710-6\">Burton contends that, on their face, Delaware\u2019s extradition documents are not in order because they incorrectly state that (1) he was in Wicomico County rather than Worcester County; (2) \u201cno former application for requisition for [him] growing out of the same transaction has been made;\u201d and (3) \u201cno delay has occurred in the prosecution of said crimes once [he] was located.\u201d In his view, these errors are not \u201ctypo[s]\u201d or \u201cminor irregularities,\u201d and therefore, are sufficient to find the extradition documents are not on their face in order.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-9\">The State responds that the circuit court did not err in finding that the errors in Delaware\u2019s extradition documents were minor typographical errors, and, despite these errors, there remained \u201ca lawful demand from the Governor of Delaware supported by affidavits, identification of Burton, and a copy of an indictment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b710-10\">Maryland appellate courts have yet to address whether \u201ctypo[s]\u201d or \u201cminor irregularities\u201d of a clerical nature can invalidate extradition documents, but several of our sister states have concluded that such minor errors do not invalidate extradition documents. <em>See, e.g., State v. McKenzie, </em>179 W.Va. 300, 301, 367 S.E.2d 769 (1988) (a warrant indicating that \u201cpolice officers had been \u2018appointed by the Governor of the State of Pennsylvania\u2019 (rather than by the Governor of the State of New York) and that the appellant was to be conveyed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"689\">*689</page-number>to Pennsylvania (rather than New York)\u201d \u201cwas [an error] of clerical nature and did not constitute such a harmful error as to justify the discharge of the appellant\u201d); <em>Andrews v. State, </em>241 Ind. 180, 181, 169 N.E.2d 193, 193-94 (1960) (misspelling Alabama (\u201cAlamaba\u201d) on an extradition request was a mere typographical error and did not invalidate the extradition documents); <em>Ex parte Morrow, </em>310 Mich. 597, 599, 17 N.W.2d 767, 768 (1945) (referencing to a warrant as an affidavit was harmless error). Such opinions reflect an understanding that allowing minor typographical or clerical irregularities to invalidate extradition documents would conflict with the United States Supreme Court\u2019s admonition that \u201ccare must be taken [so] that the process of extradition [is] not so burdened as to make it practically valueless.\u201d <em>Doran, </em>439 U.S. at 288, 99 S.Ct. 530 (citing <em>In re Strauss, </em>197 U.S. 324, 332-333, 25 S.Ct. 535, 49 L.Ed. 774 (1905)). We agree that careful consideration must be given to a claim that a minor typographical or clerical error is sufficient to invalidate extradition documents.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-5\">Burton contends that the reference to Wicomico County as his residence rather than Worcester County is sufficient to render the extradition documents not, on their face, in order. The State responds that Burton has not proven beyond a reasonable doubt that he was not in Wicomico County at the time of the extradition request. But, even if he had, the correct name of the county is insignificant because it was only necessary for the Governor to be satisfied that Burton was <em>\u201cin Maryland </em>\u201d in order to issue a Governor\u2019s Warrant of Rendition. (Emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b711-6\">The record reveals that only two documents reference Wi-comico County as Burton\u2019s residence \u2014 (1) the sworn statement by the Delaware Deputy Attorney General and (2) the Deputy Attorney General\u2019s representations in the annexed application for requisition. The other documents accompanying Delaware\u2019s application for requisition indicate that he was located in Worcester County. For example, the Delaware Attorney General\u2019s Identification Report provides that Burton\u2019s \u201cother known address\u201d is \u201c5022 Joyner Road, Snow Hill, MD 21863,\u201d which is the address of the Worcester County Jail. <em>Worcester </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"690\">*690</page-number><em>County Jail, </em>The Official Website of Worcester County, Maryland, http://co.worcester.md.us/jail/jail.aspx (last visited August 29, 2014). In addition, Worcester County Sheriff Reggie Mason received the Governor\u2019s Warrant of Rendition on October 29, 2013, along with a letter from Maryland\u2019s Extradition Coordinator requesting that \u201c[w]hen the Warrant of Rendition is executed before a judge and the fugitive is ready for return, please notify John Desmond ... and return this warrant to our office as your final report....\u201d The assertive language in the Extradition Coordinator\u2019s letter to the Worcester County Sheriff further supports the circuit court\u2019s finding that \u201ceveryone knew [the documents meant] Worcester[,].... [and the error was the] equivalent to a typo....\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b712-5\">The burden to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the extradition documents are not on their face in order falls on Burton. <em>Solomon, </em>256 Md. at 300-01, 260 A.2d 68. Starting from the presumption that, when a governor grants extradition, the Governor\u2019s Warrant of Rendition <em>and all documents accompanying the original demand </em>are in order, we are persuaded that that burden was not met. <em>See Roscoe, </em>23 Md.App. at 521-22, 328 A.2d 64. These errors are minor typographical or clerical errors that do not destroy the validity of the documents.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-6\">Burton also asserts that, because Maryland itself had filed an application for requisition to extradite Burton from Delaware, its authorities \u201chad <em>actual knowledge </em>that there had been a former application for a requisition for [him] growing out of the same transaction,\u201d (Emphasis in original), and yet, despite this knowledge, Maryland did not reject the Delaware Deputy Attorney General\u2019s statement that \u201c \u2018no former appli<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"691\">*691</page-number>cation for requisition for [Burton] growing out of the same transaction\u2019 ha[d] been made.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b713-5\">According to the State, Delaware was only assuring \u201cthat Delaware <em>itself </em>[was] not engaging in an abuse of the extradition process and ... the contested language is a reference to whether Delaware <em>itself </em>has made a prior extradition request arising from the underlying incident.\u201d (Emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b713-6\">In considering this issue, the circuit court reasoned that \u201cthe former application for requisition was made by the State of Maryland, not the State of Delaware, therefore, there\u2019s been no former application for requisition\u201d by Delaware. We agree that Delaware\u2019s extradition documents were only certifying that <em>Delaware </em>had not submitted an application for requisition of Burton.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b713-7\">Maryland\u2019s extradition statute states,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b713-8\">(a) In general \u2014 A demand for the extradition of a person charged with crime in another state may not be recognized by the Governor unless it is:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b713-9\">(1) in writing and alleging, except in cases arising under \u00a7 9-106 of this title, that the accused was present in the demanding state at the time of the commission of the alleged crime, and that thereafter the accused fled from the state; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b713-10\">(2) accompanied by:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b713-11\">(i) a copy of an indictment found or by information supported by affidavit in the state having jurisdiction of the crime, or by a copy of an affidavit made before a justice of the peace or magistrate there, together with a copy of any warrant which was issued thereupon</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b713-12\">(b) Contents of demand. \u2014 (1) The indictment, information, or affidavit made before the magistrate or justice of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"692\">*692</page-number>peace must substantially charge the person demanded with having committed a crime under the law of that state.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ADv6\">(2) The copy of indictment, information, affidavit, judgment of conviction, or sentence must be authenticated by the executive authority making the demand.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b714-5\">C.P. \u00a7 9-103. The plain language of this statute does not require a certification \u201cthat no former application for a requisition for said fugitive, growing out of the same transaction has been made.\u201d Assuming, however, that such a certification was required,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> it would seem illogical to require a state to certify what another state may have done. Moreover, Governor O\u2019Malley had sufficient accurate information to determine the issues before him. <em>See People v. Hardiman, </em>152 Ill.App.3d 38, 43, 105 Ill.Dec. 240, 504 N.E.2d 109, 113 (1987) (holding that even though the State of Florida had to resubmit an application for requisition and thereby incorrectly stated that \u201cno former applications for requisition [had] been made,\u201d the claim was without merit because \u201c[t]he Governor of Illinois had before him additional correct information to ensure that he could properly decide the matter at hand.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b714-6\">According to Burton, the extradition documents are also not in order because they falsely assert \u201cthat no delay has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"693\">*693</page-number>occurred in the prosecution of said crime once [he] was located.\u201d He states that \u201cMaryland had <em>actual knowledge </em>that Delaware had delayed more than a year in prosecuting [him].... \u201d (Emphasis in original). The State interprets, and we agree, this claim is a right to a speedy trial claim, which is a constitutional claim that we will address below.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-4\">\n<em>Whether Burton has been charged with a crime in Delaware</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b715-5\">Burton asserts that Delaware has not demonstrated that they have jurisdiction over a criminal case related to Mrs. Bennett\u2019s death, and therefore, this Court cannot conclude he is charged with a crime until Delaware establishes jurisdiction. But, \u201c[t]he [Extradition] Clause never contemplated that the asylum state was to conduct the kind of preliminary inquiry traditionally intervening between the initial arrest and trial.\u201d <em>Doran, </em>439 U.S. at 288, 99 S.Ct. 530. A Delaware grand jury has now indicted Burton, and upon that indictment, a Delaware judge has issued a warrant for Burton\u2019s arrest. It is not for Maryland courts to question Delaware\u2019s grand jury indictment or its arrest warrant.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-6\">\n<em>Whether Burton is the person named in the request for extradition</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b715-7\">Relying again on the extradition documents\u2019 incorrect statement that Burton was in Wicomico County rather than Worcester County, Burton contends that the circuit court erred in finding that Delaware\u2019s application sufficiently identified him as the person named in the application for requisition. The State responds that the extradition documents adequately identified him because they contained Burton\u2019s \u201cname, date of birth, Delaware case number, social security number, \u2018FBI # ,\u2019 and fingerprints.\u201d Again, we agree with the State.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-8\">Delaware\u2019s extradition documents provide several identifiers including Burton\u2019s height, weight, social security number, date of birth, \u201cFBI # ,\u201d Delaware case number, and fingerprints, in addition to his \u201cother known address\u201d at \u201c5022 Joyner Road, Snow Hill, MD 21863,\u201d which, as explained above, is the address of the Worcester County Jail.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"694\">*694</page-number>Burton\u2019s challenge is similar to the challenge in <em>Fullerton v. McCord, </em>339 Ark. 45, 2 S.W.3d 775 (1999), where Fullerton asserted that the trial court erred in finding that the application for requisition adequately identified him as the wanted fugitive because the documents misspelled his name. 339 Ark. at 50, 2 S.W.3d 775. The Arkansas Supreme Court determined that the demanding state also produced Fullerton\u2019s \u201cbirth date, social security number, height,\u201d weight, and testimony from an Arkansas County Deputy, who knew the appellant prior to serving him with an arrest warrant, identifying Fullerton as the accused. <em>Id. </em>at 51, 2 S.W.3d at 779. The Arkansas Supreme Court concluded that the misspelling of Fullerton\u2019s name was a \u201ctypographical error\u201d that did not negate the sufficiency of the extradition documents in identifying the appellant as the requested fugitive. <em>Id. </em>Burton\u2019s Wicomico County claim is nothing more than a clerical error that does not negate the sufficiency of the extradition documents identifying him as the accused.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-5\">Burton also challenges the circuit court\u2019s finding of a proper identification based on the failure to compare Burton\u2019s \u201clive\u201d fingerprints to the fingerprint card in the Delaware Attorney General\u2019s Identification Report. The State contends it did not have to conduct a \u201clive fingerprint examination,\u201d and its failure to do so does not satisfy Burton\u2019s burden to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that he is not the accused.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-6\">In addressing this claim, the circuit court determined that \u201c[t]here is no requirement that comparison between fingerprint cards and physical fingerprints of [Burton] be conducted ... for identification to be appropriate.... \u201d We agree. The law requires nothing more than enough evidence, which was clearly provided, to support a finding that Burton is the person sought in the application for requisition. <em>Bryson, </em>287 Md. at 470, 413 A.2d 554 (citations omitted); <em>see also Fullerton, </em>339 Ark. at 51, 2 S.W.3d at 779.

He avers that the definition of \u201cfugitive,\u201d although not specifically defined in C.P. \u00a7 9-105(b), means and requires proof that he left Delaware voluntarily in the hope of evading justice. He contends that other articles of the Maryland Code using the term \u201cfugitive\u201d all illustrate the</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b717-7\">core principle that the person willfully absented himself from a state for the purpose of evading justice. <em>See </em>Md.

It states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A-v\">[t]he Governor of this State may also surrender, on demand of the executive authority of any other state, any person in this State who is charged in the manner provided in \u00a7 9-123 of this title with having violated the laws of the state whose executive authority is making the demand, <em>even though the person left the demanding state involuntarily.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b717-10\">C.P. \u00a7 9-105(b) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b717-11\">When the General Assembly adopted the Uniform Criminal Extradition Act of 1936, which included \u00a7 5 of the Uniform Criminal Extradition Act of 1936, now codified as C.P. \u00a7 9-105(b), it stated as its purpose \u201cto make uniform the procedure on interstate extradition.\u201d 1937 Md.

The <em>Bordenkircher </em>Court addressed a prosecutorial vindictiveness claim in a pretrial setting. <em>Id. </em>at 358, 98 S.Ct. 663. The state prosecutor in <em>Bordenkircher </em>told that defendant that if he chose to not plead guilty to \u201cuttering a forged instrument ... an offense then punishable by a term of 2 to 10 years in prison,\u201d he would also be indicted on charges under the \u201cHabitual Criminal Act,\u201d which carried \u201ca mandatory sentence of life imprisonment by reason of his two prior felony convictions.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 358-59, 98 S.Ct. 663. The Supreme Court began its analysis by distinguishing prosecutorial vindictiveness in a post-trial setting from a pretrial setting, stating,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b725-6\">[t]o punish a person because he has done what the law plainly allows him to do is a due process violation of the most basic sort, and for an agent of the State to pursue a course of action whose objective is to penalize a person\u2019s reliance on his legal rights is patently unconstitutional. But in the \u201cgive-and-take\u201d of plea bargaining, there is no such element of punishment or retaliation so long as the accused is free to accept or reject the prosecution\u2019s offer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b725-7\">Plea bargaining flows from the mutuality of advantage to defendants and prosecutors, each with his own reasons for wanting to avoid trial. Defendants advised by competent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"704\">*704</page-number>counsel and protected by other procedural safeguards are presumptively capable of intelligent choice in response to prosecutorial persuasion, and unlikely to be driven to false self-condemnation. Indeed, acceptance of the basic legitimacy of plea bargaining necessarily implies rejection of any notion that a guilty plea is involuntary in a constitutional sense simply because it is the end result of the bargaining process. By hypothesis, the plea may have been induced by promises of a recommendation of a lenient sentence or a reduction of charges, and thus by fear of the possibility of a greater penalty upon conviction after a trial.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b726-5\"><em>Bordenkircher, </em>434 U.S. at 363-64, 98 S.Ct. 663 (internal quotations and citations omitted).<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> The Supreme Court ultimately found that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b726-6\">[t]o hold that the prosecutor\u2019s desire to induce a guilty plea is an \u201cunjustifiable standard,\u201d which, like race or religion, may play no part in his charging decision, would contradict the very premises that underlie the concept of plea bargain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"705\">*705</page-number>ing itself.

The defendant in <em>Goodwin </em>contended that after he exercised his right to demand a jury trial for a misdemeanor charge, the prosecutor also indicted the defendant for \u201ca felony charge,\u201d which according to the defendant, warranted a presumption of prosecutorial vindictiveness. <em>Id. </em>at 370, 102 S.Ct. 2485. The Supreme Court stated that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b727-6\">[tjhere is good reason to be cautious before adopting an inflexible presumption of prosecutorial vindictiveness in a pretrial setting. In the course of preparing a case for trial, the prosecutor may uncover additional information that suggests a basis for further prosecution or he simply may come to realize that information possessed by the State has a broader significance. At this stage of the proceedings, the prosecutor\u2019s assessment of the proper extent of prosecution may not have crystallized.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b727-7\">A prosecutor should remain free before trial to exercise the broad discretion entrusted to him to determine the extent of the societal interest in prosecution. An initial decision should not freeze future conduct.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b728-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"706\">*706</page-number><em>Id. </em>at 381-82, 102 S.Ct. 2485. The <em>Goodwin </em>Court explained that the reasons for creating a presumption of prosecutorial vindictiveness in a post-trial setting were less persuasive in a pretrial setting because of the inherent unpredictability of pretrial proceedings. <em>Id. </em>The Court again limited its holding to the specific facts of the case and did \u201cnot foreclose the possibility that a defendant in an appropriate case might prove objectively that a prosecutor\u2019s charging decision was motivated by a desire to punish him for doing something that the law plainly allowed him to do.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 384, 102 S.Ct. 2485.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-5\">Since these Supreme Court decisions, the case by case approach has rendered prosecutorial vindictiveness jurisprudence, as one court put it, \u201ccomplicated.\u201d <em>Wilson, </em>262 F.3d at 314. Currently, prosecutorial vindictiveness jurisprudence indicates that a defendant can demonstrate a prosecutorial vindictiveness claim through (1) objective and direct evidence of actual vindictiveness or (2) circumstantial evidence that warrants a presumption of vindictiveness. <em>Id. </em>The presumption of prosecutorial vindictiveness, however, is not likely, if ever, to take root in a pretrial setting. <em>Id. </em>at 315 (citing <em>Goodwin, </em>457 U.S. at 381, 102 S.Ct. 2485).</p>\n<p id=\"b728-6\">Burton does not expressly argue that the circumstances surrounding the State\u2019s decision not to prosecute in Maryland warrants a presumption of prosecutorial vindictiveness. We recognize, however, that the circumstances surrounding the State\u2019s decision not to prosecute and most especially, the lack of a death penalty in Maryland as there is in Delaware, is a significant backdrop to his vindictive prosecution argument. Therefore, with that in mind, possibly, we turn to whether he has demonstrated actual vindictiveness through direct and objective evidence that the prosecutors action\u2019s were not lawful, and were solely motivated \u201cby a desire to punish [him] for doing something that the law plainly allowed him to do.\u201d <em>Goodwin, </em>457 U.S. at 384, 102 S.Ct. 2485; <em>Wilson, </em>262 F.3d at 315 (stating that courts must \u201cbe cautious not to intrude unduly in the broad discretion given to prosecutors in making charging decisions. Indeed, a prosecutor\u2019s charging decision is presumptively lawful.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b729-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"707\">*707</page-number>In reviewing Burton\u2019s Brief along with the record, it appears that, Burton is claiming that the Maryland prosecutor dropped the Maryland charges because he refused to accept the plea deal. What pervades Burton\u2019s argument is the possibility that if he were tried in Delaware he could receive the death penalty, and that the prosecutors were working together to achieve a plea. But, as we see it, the Maryland prosecutor was simply informing Burton and his counsel that if he did not accept the plea offer, Maryland would drop the pending charges and \u201cany prosecution by Delaware would supersede the current criminal case in Maryland.\u201d The Maryland prosecutor attached the letter from Delaware prosecutors, which expressed their interest in charging Burton in Delaware and seeking the death penalty. The letter articulated the Delaware prosecutors\u2019 general theory on the murder and rape of Mrs. Bennett. Burton was aware of these alternatives when he made his decision. Like the prosecutor in <em>Bordenkircher, </em>the Maryland prosecutor merely \u201copenly presented [Burton] with the unpleasant alternatives of forgoing charges on which he was plainly subject to prosecution.\u201d <em>Bordenkircher, </em>434 U.S. at 365, 98 S.Ct. 663. The presentation of an alternative does not rise to a due process violation.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b729-5\">This case differs from <em>Bordenkircher </em>in that the prosecutor did not increase charges and did not even proceed with prosecution, but this distinction does not negate the fact that <em>Bordenkircher's </em>instructive value. Other courts presented with similar situations, have considered whether a state prosecutor has acted with actual vindictiveness when the state prosecutor drops state charges to allow a federal indictment after a defendant has refused to plead guilty to those state <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"708\">*708</page-number>charges and have not found prosecutorial vindictiveness. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Williams, </em>47 F.3d 658, 662-63 (4th Cir.1995) (holding that a state prosecutor carrying out a threat to drop a case so federal prosecutors could impose a harsher sentence was not actually vindictive); <em>United States v. Allen, </em>954 F.2d 1160, 1166 (6th Cir.1992) (holding that a state prosecutor was not actually vindictive when the state prosecutor referred the defendant\u2019s case to federal prosecutors because the federal offense carried a stiffer penalty); <em>United States v. Gray, </em>382 F.Supp.2d 898, 907 (E.D.Mich.2005) (discussing multiple federal circuit court decisions that did not find actual vindictiveness in a pretrial setting). We too are not persuaded that the Maryland prosecutor\u2019s actions demonstrate actual vindictiveness, and did not violate Burton\u2019s due process rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-5\"><em>Fifth Amendment, Fourteenth Amendment, &amp; Article 2D Due Process </em>\u2014 Governor\u2019s <em>Warrant of Rendition</em></p>\n<p id=\"b730-6\">Burton also contends that Maryland violated his due process rights by issuing the Governor\u2019s Warrant of Rendition. Burton seemingly ignores that fact that the United States Constitution and C.P. \u00a7 9-102 mandate the Governor comply with interstate extradition requests. <em>See Puerto Rico v. Branstad, </em>483 U.S. 219, 227, 107 S.Ct. 2802, 97 L.Ed.2d 187 (1987) (\u201cthe commands of the Extradition Clause are mandatory, and afford no discretion to the executive officers or the courts of the asylum State.\u201d (citation omitted)); C.P. \u00a7 9-102 (\u201c[I]t is the duty of the Governor of this State to have arrested and delivered up to the executive authority of any other state any person charged in that state with treason, felony, or other crime, who has fled from justice and is found in this State.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b730-7\">JUDGMENT AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-8\">COSTS TO BE PAID BY APPELLANT.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b701-10\">.
