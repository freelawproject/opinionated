That same year, he pleaded not guilty, in the Circuit Court for Baltimore County, to those charges and alleged that he was not competent to stand trial. The Baltimore County circuit court subsequently ordered him committed to the Clifton T. Perkins Hospital Center (\u201cPerkins\u201d) for inpatient care and treatment. There, he remained for the next four years until Perkins, in a letter to the circuit court, expressed its view that Sibug was now competent to stand trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-9\">In May of 2004, Sibug was transported from Perkins to the courthouse, where he entered a plea of not guilty, on an agreed statement of facts, to the 1999 charge of second-degree assault, and was sentenced to a term of four-and-a-half years\u2019 imprisonment on that charge. A year later, however, the circuit court vacated his conviction and sentence, concluding that Sibug\u2019s trial counsel had rendered ineffective assistance of counsel by not informing him of the immigration consequences of his assault conviction, and granted Sibug a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-10\">Sibug was retried in September of 2008. After a jury found him guilty of multiple counts of assault, using a handgun in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>the commission of a crime of violence, and giving minors access to a firearm, he was sentenced to a term of ten years\u2019 imprisonment. Although Sibug did not note an appeal from his convictions, three years later he did file a petition for post-conviction relief and was thereafter granted the right to file a belated appeal. Having done so, he now presents two questions for our consideration. Rephrased to facilitate review, they are:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b384-5\">I. Was Sibug\u2019s right to due process of law violated by the court\u2019s failure to determine, prior to his new trial, that he was competent to stand trial?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b384-6\">II. Did the trial court err in finding, at the sentencing hearing following Sibug\u2019s new trial, that he was competent to stand trial?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b384-7\">Finding no merit to either contention, we affirm.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b384-8\">Background</p>\n<p id=\"b384-9\">In October of 1998, Sibug called his five children to the kitchen table. When the family had gathered as demanded, Sibug pulled out a handgun and pointed it at each of his children, and then \u201ccock[ed]\u201d it to demonstrate that it was loaded. He then instructed his frightened children that they were to stop acting \u201crebellious\u201d and were to respect his authority as their father.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-10\">A month later, Sibug\u2019s fifteen-year-old son called the police to report this incident. He told them that Sibug, after becoming angry with him and his siblings, had pointed a gun at him and that he was afraid that his father was going to kill him. When Baltimore County police subsequently arrested Sibug, they found a handgun, as well as an assault rifle, lying on shelves in Sibug\u2019s bedroom at the family\u2019s residence. Both guns were in cases, but neither case was locked and both weapons were loaded and fully operable. Sibug was ultimately charged with multiple counts of both first-degree assault and second-degree assault, reckless endangerment, and using a handgun in the commission of a crime of violence, as well as permitting a minor access to a firearm.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>When Sibug subsequently alleged that he was not competent to stand trial, the Baltimore County circuit court ordered the State Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (\u201cthe Department\u201d) to examine Sibug.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In accordance with that order, Sibug was admitted to Perkins for evaluation on November 2, 1999.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-5\">A little more than a month later, Perkins sent a letter and a \u201ccompetency evaluation\u201d of Sibug to the circuit court. In that evaluation, Perkins opined that Sibug was not competent to stand trial and was suffering from a mental disorder that rendered him \u201cdangerous\u201d to himself and others. The evaluation further disclosed that Sibug believed that his children were \u201cbad\u201d and \u201clawless\u201d in spite of his \u201cgodly instruction,\u201d and that he had decided to discipline his children according to the Bible and \u201cGod\u2019s law.\u201d Perkins ultimately diagnosed Sibug as suffering from both a \u201cDelusional Disorder, Mixed Type\u201d and a \u201cNarcissistic Personality Disorder.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b385-6\">As for Sibug\u2019s competency to stand trial, the Perkins evaluation stated that, although Sibug understood the operation and purpose of the judicial system, he was convinced that he would not receive a fair trial because \u201cthe judicial system and its agents are \u2018of Satan,\u2019 \u201d and the prosecution against him was a battle between the \u201crighteous\u201d and the \u201cwicked.\u201d He therefore intended to base his defense on Scripture. The evaluation concluded that Sibug was unable to \u201cappreciate\u201d the proceedings against him or to assist a lawyer in his defense, particularly if the lawyer did not share his religious beliefs. In light of that evaluation, the circuit court found, on January 13, 2000, that Sibug was not competent to stand trial and then ordered that Sibug be committed to the Department for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>inpatient care and treatment at Perkins until the court was \u201csatisfied that [he was] no longer incompetent to stand trial.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b386-5\">Four months later, on May 1, 2000, Perkins sent the circuit court a letter and a new evaluation that opined that, in its view, Sibug was now competent to stand trial and, furthermore, it believed that he was \u201ccriminally responsible\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> at the time of the offense. Sibug\u2019s trial was subsequently set for August 28,'2000.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> But three-and-a-half weeks before that trial was to occur, the court received, on August 3, 2000, yet another letter from Perkins. This letter advised that Sibug\u2019s condition had \u201cdeteriorated\u201d and that, consequently, he was currently not competent to stand trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-6\">Almost three years later, on May 27, 2003, Perkins sent another letter to the circuit court, informing it that Sibug\u2019s condition had improved as a result of the medication he was receiving and that, as a consequence, Sibug was now competent to stand trial. Although Perkins requested that the court schedule a hearing to determine Sibug\u2019s competence to do so and attached, to that letter, a \u201cdraft order of competence\u201d for the court to execute, the record does not contain this order or provide any indication that a hearing was ever held.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-7\">On September 22, 2003, Sibug entered, in the Baltimore County circuit court, pleas of not guilty and not criminally responsible \u201cat the time of the commission of the offenses alleged,\u201d but did not claim that he was not competent to stand trial. Two days later, the circuit court, once again, ordered the Department to examine Sibug and determine whether he was criminally responsible \u201cat the time of [his] alleged criminal conduct.\u201d But nothing in that order required the Depart<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>ment to determine whether Sibug was presently competent to stand trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-4\">Perkins informed the court, in a letter received on October 20, 2003,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> of its conclusion that Sibug was criminally responsible \u201cat the time of the offense,\u201d as indicated by the accompanying report. That letter was followed by two additional letters from Perkins, the first on December 4, 2003, and the second on January 14, 2004; both of which reiterated that Sibug was presently competent to stand trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-5\">On May 11, 2004, four months after Perkins sent its final letter opining that Sibug was competent to stand trial, Sibug appeared in Baltimore County circuit court and, though no competency hearing had been held or a formal judicial finding of competency made, entered a plea of not guilty, on an agreed statement of facts, to one count of second-degree assault. The court then found Sibug guilty and sentenced him to a term of four-and-a-half years\u2019 imprisonment, but granted him credit for time served, which resulted in Sibug\u2019s immediate release. During that proceeding, neither defense counsel, the State, nor the court raised the question of Sibug\u2019s competence to stand trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-6\">Only two months later, Sibug filed a petition for writ of error coram nobis in the Baltimore County circuit court, contending, among other things, that he had not been advised of the effect a conviction for assault would have on his immigration status.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> On June 21, 2005, the circuit court, upon finding that Sibug\u2019s trial counsel had rendered ineffective assistance of counsel by not advising him of the immigration consequences of his assault conviction, granted Sibug\u2019s peti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>tion for writ of error coram nobis, vacated his sentence, and granted Sibug a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-5\">Three years later, on September 10, 2008, Sibug\u2019s new trial commenced before a jury in the Baltimore County circuit court. The record reveals that, in the three years between the circuit court\u2019s order granting a new trial and the start of that trial, Sibug never pleaded that he was not competent to stand trial, nor did he or his counsel give any indication to the court that his competence was in issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-6\">At trial, the jury heard testimony from three of Sibug\u2019s children regarding the events of October of 1998. Sibug\u2019s oldest son, who had reported the incident to the police, recalled Sibug pointing his handgun at each of the children and that he had been \u201cscared\u201d and \u201cthought [he] was going to die.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Then, testifying on his own behalf, Sibug admitted that he placed his handgun on the kitchen table, while sitting with his children, but said that he was only trying to \u201cget [his children\u2019s] attention\u201d because they did not respect and love him and, consequently, did not respect and love the teachings of the Bible. His display of a handgun was, in his words, to \u201ctest\u201d his children\u2019s \u201cfaith.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b388-7\">The jury found Sibug guilty of two counts of first-degree assault, two counts of second-degree assault, one count of using a handgun in the commission of a crime of violence, and one count of giving minors access to a firearm. A motion for a new trial followed in which Sibug alleged, for the first time, that he had not been competent to stand trial, which was bourne out, asserted the motion, by Sibug\u2019s testimony at trial and \u201chis lack of intelligent communications with his trial attorney.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b389-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>At Sibug\u2019s sentencing proceeding on October 31, 2008, over a month after his trial had ended, the court considered his motion for a new trial. At that time, the court asked Sibug\u2019s counsel whether he wished to proffer any \u201cadditional evidence\u201d as to Sibug\u2019s competence to stand trial. Defense counsel responded that he was \u201cnot prepared\u201d to do so.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> After observing that neither Sibug nor his counsel had ever alleged, either before or during trial, that Sibug\u2019s competency was in question; that the court file contained the January 14, 2004 letter from Perkins stating that, in its opinion, Sibug was competent to stand trial; and that Sibug had \u201cseemed to understand exactly what was going on\u201d during his trial proceedings, the court found that Sibug was competent to stand trial. It therefore denied Sibug\u2019s motion for a new trial and sentenced him to a total of ten years\u2019 imprisonment with credit for pre-trial detention, which included the time that Sibug had been committed to Perkins.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-4\">Although Sibug did not appeal his convictions, he filed, two- and-a-half years later, on March 8, 2011, a <em>pro se </em>petition for post-conviction relief, seeking the right to file a belated notice of appeal. On December 18, 2012, with the consent of both sides to the controversy, the circuit court entered an order granting Sibug the right to file a belated notice of appeal within thirty days. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-5\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b389-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-7\">Sibug contends that the circuit court denied him due process of law in failing to determine whether he had regained his competence to stand trial before proceeding with his re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>trial. He points out that, after the circuit court found him to be incompetent to stand trial in 2000, the court never subsequently formally found him to be otherwise. The court erred, he insists, in trying him in 2008 without rendering such a finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-5\">It is \u201cwell established that the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment prohibits the criminal prosecution of a defendant who is not competent to stand trial.\u201d <em>Medina v. California, 505 </em>U.S. 437, 439, 112 S.Ct. 2572, 120 L.Ed.2d 353 (1992); <em>see also Trimble v. State, </em>321 Md. 248, 254, 582 A.2d 794 (1990) (\u201cIf a state fails to observe procedures adequate to protect a defendant\u2019s right not to be tried or convicted while incompetent, it denies him due process.\u201d). To be \u201cnot competent to stand trial\u201d means that a defendant is not able \u201c(1) to understand the nature or object of the proceeding; or (2) to assist in [his] defense.\u201d Md.Code Crim. Proc. \u00a7 3 \u2014 101(f) (2001, 2008 Repl.Vol.). Conversely, \u201cto be competent to stand trial\u201d means that a defendant has the \u201cpresent ability to consult with his lawyer with a reasonable degree of rational understanding\u201d and a \u201crational as well as factual understanding of the proceedings against him.\u201d <em>Thanos v. State, </em>330 Md. 77, 85, 622 A.2d 727 (1993) (internal citation omitted). In any event, until proven otherwise, a defendant is presumed to be competent to stand trial. <em>Peaks v. State, </em>419 Md. 239, 251, 18 A.3d 917 (2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b390-6\">In \u201cplac[ing] the duty to determine competence to stand trial on the trial court,\u201d <em>Gregg v. State, </em>377 Md. 515, 526, 833 A.2d 1040 (2003), the legislature has mandated \u201cprecise actions to be taken by a trial court when an accused\u2019s competency to stand trial [is] questioned,\u201d <em>Roberts v. State, </em>361 Md. 346, 363, 761 A.2d 885 (2000). Of particular relevance to any competency determination is section 3-104(a) of the Criminal Procedure Article,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> which states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b390-7\">If, before or during a trial, the defendant in a criminal case ... appears to the court to be incompetent to stand trial or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>the defendant alleges incompetence to stand trial, the court shall determine, on evidence presented in the record, whether the defendant is incompetent to stand trial.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b391-5\">In other words, there are three ways a trial court\u2019s duty to determine a defendant\u2019s competence may be triggered: upon the motion of the defendant, upon the motion of the defendant\u2019s counsel, or \u201cupon a <em>sua sponte </em>determination by the court that the defendant may not be competent to stand trial.\u201d <em>Thanos, </em>330 Md. at 85, 622 A.2d 727. Once a defendant\u2019s incompetence to stand trial has been alleged, the actions a court must take in determining his or her competence are organized into three successive steps:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b391-6\">(1) First, a determination of competency may be made at any time before or during a trial; (2) Second, such a determination must be made if the defendant in a criminal case appears to be incompetent to stand trial or the defendant alleges incompetence to stand trial; and (3) Finally, the court must make its determination on the evidence presented on the record.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b391-7\"><em>Wood v. </em>State, 436 Md. 276, 286, 81 A.3d 427 (2013) (quoting <em>Roberts, </em>361 Md. at 364, 761 A.2d 885).</p>\n<p id=\"b391-8\">The first step \u201cspecifies the time frame within which the question of the [defendant\u2019s] competency must be made,\u201d the second step requires that the issue of competency be \u201cproperly before the court,\u201d and the third step ensures that the defendant\u2019s due process rights are protected. <em>Id. </em>at 286-87, 81 A.3d 427. Although the court\u2019s determination of competence \u201cneed not be in the form of a formal hearing,\u201d <em>Peaks, </em>419 Md. at 254, 18 A.3d 917 if the defendant\u2019s allegation of incompetence is \u201cunsupported by any evidence on the record to that time,\u201d the defendant must be allowed to \u201cpresent evidence on which a determination may be made,\u201d <em>Gregg, </em>377 Md. at 539, 833 A.2d 1040. Finally, the court\u2019s determination of competency \u201cis to be held to a standard of beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Roberts, </em>361 Md. at 365-67, 761 A.2d 885.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-9\">It is clear from the record that the issue of Sibug\u2019s competence was properly before the circuit court before his initial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>trial when he alleged, in 1999, that he was not competent to stand trial. The sentence he subsequently received was vacated on the grounds of ineffective assistance of counsel, and he was awarded a new trial. But the issue of Sibug\u2019s competence was never raised by counsel or Sibug\u2019s courtroom behavior prior to or during his new trial in 2008.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-5\">Given that the reversal of a conviction \u201cwith an order for a new trial, \u2018wipe[s] the slate clean,\u2019 and the case [begins] anew procedurally,\u201d returning the case to the stage where \u201cany pretrial motions could be filed and resolved,\u201d <em>Hammersla v. State, </em>184 Md.App. 295, 313-14, 965 A.2d 912 (2009), it was incumbent upon Sibug, or his counsel, to raise the issue of incompetency anew. <em>Cf. Harrod v. State, </em>423 Md. 24, 34-36, 31 A.3d 173 (2011) (explaining that the grant of a mistrial, like the grant of a new trial, \u201crequires the litigants to observe pretrial procedures once again,\u201d including the State\u2019s obligation to give notice of its intent to introduce a chemist\u2019s report even though the same report had been introduced at the first trial); <em>Marshall v. State, </em>213 Md.App. 532, 550-54, 74 A.3d 831 (2013) (concluding that the grant of a new trial \u201ceffectively wipe[d] out the prior proceedings\u201d and required the defendant to allege at his second trial that the Maryland gang statute was unconstitutional even though he had raised that same issue prior to his first trial).</p>\n<p id=\"b392-6\">Although no appellate decision has stated that a defendant\u2019s incompetence to stand trial must be raised anew, by court, counsel, or circumstances, after a new trial has been granted, the Court of Appeals\u2019 decision in <em>Gregg v. State </em>has lent helpful guidance to us in reaching the conclusion that we do today. In that case, the District Court of Maryland ordered a competency evaluation of John Leon Gregg, who was charged with second-degree assault. 377 Md. at 518, 833 A.2d 1040. At the competency hearing that followed, the district court\u2014 after reviewing the report prepared by the facility where Gregg had been evaluated, hearing testimony from one of Gregg\u2019s evaluators, and questioning Gregg directly \u2014 found Gregg competent to stand trial. <em>Id. </em>at 518-22, 833 A.2d 1040. Gregg subsequently prayed a jury trial and the case was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>transferred to the circuit court, where Gregg was tried by a jury and found guilty. <em>Id. </em>at 523, 833 A.2d 1040. He thereafter noted an appeal, contending that the circuit court had a duty to inquire into his competence to stand trial and had erred in failing to do so. <em>Id. </em>at 524-25, 833 A.2d 1040.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-5\">The Court of Appeals explained that, when Gregg\u2019s case was removed to the circuit court, \u201cthe proceedings properly began anew,\u201d and the circuit court was not bound by the district court\u2019s ruling on \u201cpre-trial matters,\u201d including any prior determination of Gregg\u2019s competence. <em>Id. </em>at 542-43, 833 A.2d 1040. Since the circuit court trial was a \u201cseparate and distinct\u201d proceeding from the district court trial, the issue of Gregg\u2019s competence to stand trial had to be \u201craised anew in the Circuit Court proceedings,\u201d according to the Court of Appeals, \u201cin order to compel the need for a competency determination.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 545, 833 A.2d 1040. Because that issue was not raised anew in the circuit court, and because Gregg\u2019s behavior at trial did not trigger any obligation of that court to evaluate his competence <em>sua sponte, </em>the issue of Gregg\u2019s competency \u201cwas not properly before the court,\u201d said the Court of Appeals, and thus the circuit court did not err in failing to address it. <em>Id. </em>at 541-45, 833 A.2d 1040.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-6\">As Gregg\u2019s circuit court trial was \u201cseparate and distinct\u201d from the preceding district court proceeding, so too was Sibug\u2019s new trial \u201cseparate and distinct\u201d from his first trial. It, in effect, \u201cwiped the slate clean.\u201d <em>Hammersla v. State, </em>184 Md.App. at 313, 965 A.2d 912. It is therefore clear that the issue of competence had to be raised afresh at Sibug\u2019s new trial, a conclusion particularly compelling in the instant case, given that four-and-a-half years had passed since his first trial and that he was ultimately assessed as competent, if not by the court then at least by the evaluators at Perkins. Thus, if Sibug wished to again raise the issue of his competence, he was required to bring that issue to the court\u2019s attention before or during his new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-7\">But, at no time before or during his new trial did Sibug or his counsel allege, suggest, or give the slightest indication that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>his competence might be at issue. And, since the court was never asked to evaluate Sibug\u2019s competency by anyone, the \u201conly way\u201d in which the question of competency could have been placed before the circuit court was if Sibug \u201cappear[ed] to the court to be incompetent to stand trial,\u201d triggering the court\u2019s <em>\u201csua sponte </em>duty\u201d to evaluate his competence. <em>Gregg, </em>377 Md. at 545, 833 A.2d 1040. But there was nothing about Sibug\u2019s appearance, conduct, or behavior that indicated to the court that such an evaluation was appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-4\">As we have previously explained, a defendant is considered competent to stand trial if he has the \u201cpresent ability to consult with his lawyer with a reasonable degree of rational understanding\u201d to assist in his own defense, as well as a \u201crational as well as factual understanding of the proceedings against him.\u201d <em>Thanos v. State, </em>330 Md. 77, 84-85, 622 A.2d 727 (1993). The circuit court, in finding at sentencing that Sibug was competent to stand trial, recalled its observations of Sibug during the trial and concluded that Sibug \u201cseemed to understand exactly what was going on\u201d during the proceedings. The court\u2019s conclusion is supported by the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-5\">At no time during trial did it appear from the transcript of that proceeding that Sibug did not have the ability to work with his lawyer and to assist in his own defense. In fact, when he was called to the stand, he gave coherent responses to his counsel\u2019s questions, elaborating lucidly upon those responses when asked to do so. Then, on cross-examination, Sibug responded to the State\u2019s questions without any outbursts or digressions and even engaged in efforts to correct the State when he believed it had mis-characterized his testimony.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b395-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>Furthermore, Sibug appeared to have a complete understanding of why he was being prosecuted and what his role was in the proceedings against him. Before taking the stand to testify, Sibug informed the court that he could not \u201cswear\u201d but that he could \u201cappear ... for the record,\u201d indicating that he understood the importance of testifying under oath. And, although his testimony was heavily infused with references to Scripture, Sibug provided a rational, albeit disturbing, justification for his actions, explaining that he brought his handgun out in front of his children not to scare them but to \u201ctest their faith.\u201d Their faith needed to be tested, he said, because they were \u201crebellious\u201d and \u201cwicked,\u201d and they did not respect his authority as their father.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-5\">Moreover, Sibug\u2019s attentive and appropriate behavior at trial stands in stark contrast to the actions of defendants who, in other cases, such as <em>Trimble v. State, </em>321 Md. 248, 582 A.2d 794 (1990), and <em>Thanos v. State, </em>330 Md. 576, 625 A.2d 932 (1993), later claimed on appeal that their behavior at trial was so abnormal as to warrant a competency hearing. Although the actions of the defendants in those cases were, unlike Sibug\u2019s trial conduct, disruptive, the Court of Appeals held that such behavior did not raise a question of competency to stand trial. <em>See Trimble, </em>321 Md. at 254-56, 582 A.2d 794 (concluding that the court was not required to hold an additional competency hearing despite the defendant\u2019s \u201cbizarre behavior,\u201d which included painting a red cross on his shaved head and making obscene gestures); <em>Thanos, </em>330 Md. at 584-87, 625 A.2d 932 (holding that the defendant\u2019s documented history of mental illness and his \u201cobnoxious comments and angry outbursts throughout the proceedings\u201d did not obligate the court to inquire into his competence when the defendant interacted with the court and his attorney and \u201cclearly understood the proceedings against him\u201d)</p>\n<p id=\"b395-6\">In contrast, the transcript of the trial proceedings reveals that Sibug presented himself as an individual with strong religious views which, he believed, supported his actions. But there were no outbursts from Sibug during the trial, no obnoxious or aggressive comments to the court or to counsel, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>and no vulgar gestures or actions. Indeed, his participation in his trial was respectful and his testimony was responsive to the questions posed by defense counsel and the State. Quite simply, there is nothing in the record that would indicate to the court that Sibug lacked a rational or factual understanding of the proceedings or the ability to assist in his own defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-5\">We conclude that the issue of Sibug\u2019s competence to stand trial was never before the circuit court at his new trial as it was not raised by counsel, the court, or Sibug\u2019s courtroom behavior. As such, the circuit court did not err in not determining whether Sibug was competent, because the issue was not before it.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-7\">Sibug contends that the circuit court erred in finding, at the sentencing hearing following his second trial, that he was competent when he stood trial, without holding a competency hearing, as his counsel requested. He further claims that the court did not base its decision that Sibug was competent on an \u201cadequate record.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b396-8\">As we previously noted, section 3-104(a) of the Criminal Procedure Article requires a judicial determination of a defendant\u2019s competence to stand trial only if the question of competence is raised before or during the trial. And, as we stated earlier, Sibug\u2019s competence to stand trial was never made an issue before or during his trial. Accordingly, section 3-104(a) is not applicable to this case, and the court had no obligation to make a judicial determination of Sibug\u2019s competence.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-9\">Nonetheless, the court decided that it \u201ccould\u201d hold a hearing under the auspices of section 3-104(c) of the Criminal Procedure Article, which states: \u201cAt any time before final judgment, the court may reconsider the question of whether the defendant is incompetent to stand trial.\u201d And, although the court was only required, under section 3-104(c), to consider \u201cevidence presented on the record during the course\u201d of the trial with regard to Sibug\u2019s competency, <em>Peaks, </em>419 Md. at 259, 18 A.3d 917 the court nonetheless gave Sibug\u2019s counsel <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>the opportunity to proffer additional evidence in support of the allegation that Sibug was not competent to stand trial. Si-bug\u2019s counsel, however, responded that he was \u201cnot prepared\u201d at that time to present evidence \u201cto suggest competency or incompetency\u201d and that he was basing his request for a competency determination on his \u201cobservation[s] and [his] consistent contact\u201d with Sibug. The court then determined that Sibug was competent to stand trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-4\">In concluding that Sibug was competent to stand trial, the court noted that neither Sibug nor his counsel had alleged, before or during the trial, that his competence was in question. Then, after noting that the last letter from Perkins stated that, in its opinion, Sibug was competent to stand trial, and after observing that Sibug \u201cseemed to understand exactly what was going on\u201d at trial, the court found that Sibug understood \u201cthe nature of the proceedings against him, [that] he was able to assist in his own defense,\u201d and that he was therefore competent to stand trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-5\">In sum, at Sibug\u2019s sentencing, the court held a hearing on the issue of Sibug\u2019s competence, even though it was not required to do so. At that time it offered Sibug\u2019s counsel the opportunity to present additional evidence on that issue and, when no further evidence was offered, it based its determination that Sibug was competent on the information provided in the court file and on its personal observations of Sibug during trial. We find that the court did not err in so finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-6\">JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR BALTIMORE COUNTY AFFIRMED.

It is unclear whether this letter was sent in direct response to the court's September 24th order that Sibug be evaluated to determine whether he was criminally responsible at the time of the alleged offenses.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b387-8\">. Sibug was born in the Philippines but had been a permanent resident of the United States since 1993. The Immigration and Nationalization Service issued a warrant for Sibug\u2019s arrest one day after he was found guilty of second-degree assault. Because of his assault conviction, Sibug was facing deportation to the Philippines.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b388-8\">.

The circuit court noted that the certificate of service filed with Sibug's motion for a new trial \u201cre\u00a3lect[ed] a notice of appeal and not a motion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>fer new trial.\u201d Because of that error, the court docketed the motion as \u201ccorrespondence only\u201d and did not rule on the motion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b389-9\">. Defense counsel also informed the court that Sibug wished to proceed to sentencing and had asked him to withdraw his motion, but counsel felt he had \u201cto make this motion as his lawyer\u201d and asked the court to grant a new trial so that Sibug\u2019s competence could be evaluated.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b390-9\">.
