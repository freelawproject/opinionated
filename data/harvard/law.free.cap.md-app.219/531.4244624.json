Francis, Milton G. Smith, III, and Gregory Hellen, appellants.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The complaint alleged a violation of Articles 24 and 26 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights (Count I), false imprisonment (Count II), battery (Count III), and, assault (Count IV) based on the officers\u2019 actions in taking him from Baltimore in a police van, assaulting him, breaking his phone, and then dropping him off in Howard County, in the rain, without shoes, socks or a way home.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-9\">A jury found in favor of Mr. Johnson, awarding compensatory damages in the amount of $465,000 and $35,000 in punitive damages. The court subsequently granted, in part, the officers\u2019 motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict (\u201cJNOV\u201d), striking the $1,000 punitive damages award against Detective Hellen and finding the award of compensatory damages to be excessive.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-10\">On appeal, the officers present the following questions for our review, which we have revised, as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b560-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>1. Did the circuit court err in admitting evidence of a similar incident relating to another individual?</p>\n<p id=\"b560-5\">2. Did the circuit court err in failing to further reduce the damages award?</p>\n<p id=\"b560-6\">3. Did the circuit court err in allowing the jury to consider the issue of malice?</p>\n<p id=\"b560-7\">For the reasons set forth below, we agree that the damages award should be reversed, in part. Otherwise, we affirm the judgment of the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-8\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b560-9\">The complaint alleged that, on Thursday, May 4, 2009, at approximately 6:30 p.m., Mr. Johnson was in front of his cousins\u2019 house at 1648 North Gilmor Street with a group of teenagers. A BCPD van pulled up, and an officer inside the van told the group: \u201cKeep it moving.\u201d The teens left the area and walked around the block to a playground. After some time, they returned to 1648 North Gilmor Street.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-10\">The BCPD van came back, and the police officer sitting on the passenger side of the van, Detective Hellen, rolled down the window and told Mr. Johnson to come over to the van. Mr. Johnson did so, and the driver of the van, Detective Francis, commented on his \u201cnice watch.\u201d A third police officer in the back of the van, Detective Smith, stated: \u201cIf you look at me the wrong way again, I am going to ram this stick up your ass.\u201d Mr. Johnson responded: \u201cMan you ain\u2019t going to do nothing,\u201d and he walked away.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-11\">Detective Francis then backed up the van, and Detective Smith got out, grabbed Mr. Johnson and pulled him into the back of the van. Detective Smith began hitting him in the legs with his police baton, and he placed his hands around Mr. Johnson\u2019s neck, choking him. Detective Smith then took Mr. Johnson\u2019s cell phone, broke it in half, and threw it out the window. Detective Francis told Detective Smith that he would \u201ckeep driving until you say stop.\u201d Detective Smith did <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>not tell Detective Francis to stop until they had arrived in Ellicott City, Maryland.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-5\">Detective Francis told Mr. Johnson to give him his shoes. Detective Hellen told Detective Smith to \u201ctake his socks too.\u201d Mr. Johnson responded: \u201cMan it is cold and raining,\u201d to which Detective Smith responded: \u201cWe don\u2019t care.\u201d Detective Smith then took off Mr. Johnson\u2019s socks, opened the door to the van, and pushed Mr. Johnson out onto the grass.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-6\">Mr. Johnson walked to a gas station and called 911. The Howard County Police Department (\u201cHCPD\u201d) responded and contacted the BCPD, asking to meet at the county line to transfer Mr. Johnson. The BCPD responded that it did not do transfers to take people home. The HCPD drove Mr. Johnson back to his home in Baltimore City.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-7\">The complaint alleged that the officers were \u201cacting ... within the scope of their employment as Baltimore City Police Officers\u201d when the foregoing occurred, and they \u201cmaliciously, intentionally, carelessly, recklessly, with gross negligence, wantonly, willfully, wrongfully, unreasonably, with reckless disregard for human life; and without justification assaulted, battered, and detained\u201d Mr. Johnson. Mr. Johnson sought compensatory damages in the amount of ten million dollars ($10,000,000) and punitive damages in the amount of fifteen million dollars ($15,000,000).</p>\n<p id=\"b561-8\">Trial was held on January 17-25, 2013. At the start of trial, counsel for the officers moved <em>in limine </em>to exclude any reference to the alleged abduction of Shawnquin Woodland,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> which involved the same officers and occurred approximately one hour prior to the incident with Mr. Johnson. Counsel argued that any such evidence was irrelevant, and that Mr. Johnson was seeking to introduce that evidence to prejudice the jury by attempting to show that \u201cthese officers were riding around kidnapping people.\u201d Mr. Johnson\u2019s counsel responded that the evidence of Mr. Woodland\u2019s abduction was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>being offered pursuant to Md. Rule 5-404(b) to show proof of motive and to show that the officers\u2019 actions were part of a common scheme.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-5\">The court denied the motion <em>in limine. </em>It began by stating that, pursuant to <em>Ruffin Hotel Corporation of Maryland v. Gasper, </em>418 Md. 594, 625, 17 A.3d 676 (2011), Md. Rule 5-404(b) applied only to evidence offered by the State against a defendant in a criminal case; it did not apply in the civil context. Applying the applicable civil rules, the court addressed whether the evidence was relevant. In that regard, the court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b562-6\">The evidence that\u2019s been ... proffered to me is that an incident that occurred ... less than an hour prior to the incident in question at a location that was at or near the location of the incident in question. The incident involved all three of the same defendants. They were obviously ... working as police officers at that time. They were driving the same vehicle, an unmarked van. At that time from what\u2019s been proffered to me and what\u2019s been shown is that they used their police powers, their ... presence as police officers to take an individual into custody in the van.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b562-7\">[Thereafter the individual is in the van and the officers allegedly ... make statements to that ... particular person, exerting their influences, which I assume to be characterized, again, these are allegations at this point in time, of intimidation in an attempt to, in a sense to exert their influence____And after ... having the person in the van for a period of time, then, in fact, they then mete out the same type of punishment, meaning driving them to a far off location and basically ejecting the person from the van.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b562-10\">It seems to me under [Rule] 401 that\u2019s clearly going to be relevant evidence. They\u2019re clearly and these, the contested issues in this case are fairly obvious, but for instance, the ... that particular evidence being, I\u2019d ... say arguably not just a common scheme but part of the same scheme....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b563-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>[T]he same scheme with Mr. Woodland and with Mr. Johnson. So I find that certainly it has relevance among many different things ... for instance ... whether or not the defendants acted reasonably and took actions that were not reasonably necessary, whether they acted with or without malice, and whether they acted with or without justification, whether they acted intentionally and knowingly in carrying out this alleged act of intimidation. And clearly also relevant to whether or not the plaintiff, himself, had given his consent.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b563-5\">After finding that the evidence was relevant, the court addressed whether the probative value of the evidence substantially outweighed the danger of unfair prejudice pursuant to Md. Rule 5-403. In that regard, the court stated that the evidence that\u2019s going to be provided \u201cgoes to the crux of this case, what exactly was the intent of the parties and whether or not the plaintiff consented.\u201d Although the evidence \u201cwill have substantial impact on this trial, I do find ... that ... the probative value significantly outweighs any danger of unfair prejudice.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b563-6\">Mr. Woodland was Mr. Johnson\u2019s first witness. He testified that, on May 4, 2009, he was 15 years old. He lived on Pennsylvania Avenue in Baltimore, approximately three blocks from North Gilmor Street, where he sometimes would \u201chang out\u201d with his friends. That day, Mr. Woodland was outside standing on North Gilmor Street talking to his friend when he observed a blue van with tinted windows pull up. He could see three people in the van. Mr. Woodland was laughing at a joke that his friend had made, and when the van pulled up, the driver of the van, Detective Francis, asked him: \u201cWhat was funny.\u201d Mr. Woodland did not respond. The three officers then got out of the van and asked Mr. Woodland for his name. Again, he did not respond because he \u201cwasn\u2019t doing nothing wrong.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b563-7\">The officer sitting in the back of the van, Detective Smith, said that Mr. Woodland \u201cthought [he] was tough\u201d and asked him \u201cwhat was [he] laughing at.\u201d Detective Smith then placed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>Mr. Woodland in handcuffs, told him that he \u201cneeded to learn respect,\u201d and placed Mr. Woodland in the van. Mr. Woodland went to sit down on the seat, and Detective Smith told him that he \u201cwasn\u2019t good enough to sit in a seat,\u201d and he \u201chad to sit on the floor.\u201d When the van drove away, Detective Francis stated that he wanted to \u201csee [Mr. Woodland] dead in three years,\u201d and he wanted to \u201cscrape [him] off the street.\u201d Detective Francis and Detective Smith joked that they were going to take Mr. Woodland to Ocean City, strip him naked, and take him to the train tracks and leave him there. Detective Hellen, who was sitting in the front passenger seat of the van, did not say anything.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-5\">After approximately twenty-five minutes of driving, the van slowed down. Detective Smith took off the handcuffs, and without waiting for the van to come to a complete stop, pushed Mr. Woodland out of the van near a group of men standing on the corner, yelling \u201cthanks for the information.\u201d Mr. Woodland had not given the officers any information. Mr. Woodland, who had no money and no cell phone, got up and began walking back to West Baltimore. It took him approximately 45 minutes to walk home.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-6\">When Mr. Woodland got back to North Gilmor Street, he saw Mr. Johnson and Myron Evans. Mr. Woodland told Mr. Johnson and Mr. Evans what had happened to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-7\">Sometime thereafter, the same blue van with the same officers came through North Gilmor Street again and drove by Mr. Woodland and his friends. The van stopped, and Detective Francis said that Mr. Woodland was a \u201cfast motherfucker.\u201d Mr. Woodland walked away down the street.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-8\">Mr. Woodland later saw the van stopped and the officers yelling at Mr. Johnson. Mr. Johnson walked away from the van, but Detective Smith got out from the back of the van, grabbed Mr. Johnson\u2019s shirt, and pulled him into the van. The van drove away. Mr. Woodland did not speak to Mr. Johnson again until the next day. He did not speak to any police officer about the incident until a few weeks later, when they contacted him.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>Mr. Johnson testified on his own behalf. On May 4, 2009, Mr. Johnson was 15 years old. That day, after school, he went home, dropped his books off, changed his clothes, took his father\u2019s cell phone from his house, and went to his cousin\u2019s house at 1648 North Gilmor Street. Mr. Johnson was playing video games with his cousin, Myron Evans, when they heard people outside talking. They went outside to see what was going on and saw Mr. Woodland walking down the street. Mr. Woodland looked \u201csluggish and lost ... dehydrated.\u201d When Mr. Woodland reached Mr. Johnson and Mr. Evans, they had a conversation that made Mr. Johnson \u201cwonder what they was going to do next or was they going to come back.\u201d At the time of the conversation, Mr. Johnson noticed a blue van with tinted windows in the vicinity. The van pulled over, and the driver of the van, Detective Francis, stated to Mr. Woodland that \u201che was a fast motherfucking walker.\u201d The van then pulled away, and Mr. Woodland left.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-4\">A short while later, as Mr. Johnson and Mr. Evans were sitting in front of 1648 North Gilmor Street, Mr. Johnson observed the van, followed by a white Nissan, driving through the neighborhood. The third or fourth time the van and the Nissan drove down the block, one of the occupants of the van told Mr. Johnson to \u201ckeep it moving.\u201d Mr. Johnson and Mr. Evans then walked to a nearby playground. Corey Taylor, another friend, was at the playground.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-5\">While Mr. Johnson, Mr. Evans, and Mr. Taylor were at the playground, they saw the van again, so they went back to North Gilmor Street to try to \u201cget away from them.\u201d When they got to North Gilmor Street, the van came back around the corner and pulled up next to Mr. Johnson and Mr. Evans. The van stopped, and Detective Francis stated to Mr. Johnson: \u201c[Y]ou in the black, come here.\u201d Mr. Johnson walked to the van. Detective Francis told Mr. Johnson to \u201cstick [his] head in the window,\u201d and when Mr. Johnson complied, he saw Detective Smith in the back of the van \u201cswinging a nightstick.\u201d Detective Smith asked Mr. Johnson \u201cwhat [he] was looking at\u201d and told him if he \u201cever look[ed] at [him] wrong again,\u201d he would \u201cram this stick up your ass.\u201d Mr. Johnson walked away <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>from the van, telling Detective Smith \u201cyou ain\u2019t going to do nothing.\u201d As Mr. Johnson walked away, the van backed up and Detective Smith got out, grabbed Mr. Johnson by the collar, threw him in the van, and hit him in the side of his face with the nightstick.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-4\">Detective Smith then told Mr. Johnson to \u201c[s]coot the fuck over.\u201d Mr. Johnson sat on the seat behind Detective Hellen, who was in the front passenger seat. The van then pulled away. Detective Smith asked Mr. Johnson if he had any money. He then went into Mr. Johnson\u2019s pockets and took his father\u2019s cell phone, telling him he would not need it. Detective Smith broke the phone in half and threw the battery out of the window. He told Mr. Johnson: \u201cTail's corner [is] ... going to learn some respect.\u201d Detective Francis said that he would continue driving until Detective Smith told him to stop. Detective Hellen never said anything.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-5\">Mr. Johnson estimated that he was in the van for a couple of hours. The van stopped in a park in Howard County. Mr. Johnson did not know anyone in Howard County. It was dark outside and pouring rain. When the van stopped, one of the officers told Mr. Johnson to take his shoes off. Detective Smith then snatched his shoes from him. Another officer told Detective Smith to \u201cget his socks, too.\u201d Mr. Johnson complained that it was raining, and one of the officers said: \u201c[D]o you think we care?\u201d Detective Smith opened the door and pushed Mr. Johnson out in the grass. The van then pulled away.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-6\">Mr. Johnson sat on the ground for a while, trying to figure out what to do. He started walking, and when he came to a Citgo gas station, he called 911, telling the dispatcher that the police had beat him up and dropped him off, and he did not know where he was. Approximately 15 minutes later, a Howard County police officer arrived. The officer drove Mr. Johnson back to his home. After Mr. Johnson returned home, he saw Mr. Taylor, who had Mr. Johnson\u2019s shoes and socks.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-7\">Mr. Taylor testified that he had seen Mr. Johnson and Mr. Evans at the playground, and they then returned to North <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>Gilmor Street. He observed a blue van stopped a few doors down from Mr. Evans\u2019s house. Mr. Johnson walked toward the van and put his head in the window. Mr. Johnson then walked away from the van, but someone got out of the van, grabbed him, and shoved him in the van. The person who shoved Mr. Johnson into the van had a nightstick. Mr. Taylor heard someone say \u201c[sjcoot the fuck over.\u201d The van then drove off.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-5\">Approximately three or four hours later, Mr. Taylor saw the van again. The back passenger door of the van opened and someone threw something out. Mr. Taylor went to see what it was, and he saw Mr. Johnson\u2019s shoes with the socks tucked inside. Mr. Taylor picked up the shoes and took them to Mr. Evans\u2019s house. Mr. Taylor subsequently went to Mr. Johnson\u2019s house and saw Mr. Johnson, who was crying.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-6\">Michael, Sr. testified that, after Mr. Evans told him what had happened with his son earlier in the day, he observed his son get out of a Howard County police car. Mr. Johnson looked confused and was not wearing any shoes or socks. A few minutes later, Mr. Taylor came around the corner holding his son\u2019s shoes. When his son later returned his phone to him, it was broken in two pieces.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-7\">Officer Terrence Benn, a member of the HCPD, testified that, on May 4, 2009, he was dispatched to a Citgo gas station on Baltimore National Pike between 7:47 p.m. and 7:49 p.m. to check on the welfare of a person. When he arrived, he found Mr. Johnson, who was damp and not wearing any shoes or socks. Mr. Johnson appeared to be \u201cafraid and a little shaken up.\u201d Mr. Johnson asked Officer Benn if he could use his cell phone to call home, and he asked Officer Benn for a ride home. He stated that he had been \u201csnatched up by three undercover officers from West Baltimore,\u201d who had broken his phone, taken his shoes and socks, and dropped him off in Howard County. Officer Benn drove Mr. Johnson to his home in Baltimore.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-8\">Detective Smith testified that, on May 4, 2009, he was working in plainclothes with Detective Francis and Detective <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>Hellen as a member of the Violent Repeat Offender Squad in the Gilmor Homes housing projects. The Violent Repeat Offender Squad was assigned a blue Dodge Caravan. Mr. Johnson was in the van on that date for the purpose of \u201cgathering intel on violent crimes in the area\u201d pursuant to an ongoing investigation. Similarly, Mr. Woodland earlier was in the van to help the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-4\">Detective Smith explained that his interaction with Mr. Woodland began after he received a 911 call regarding two males dealing drugs at a red truck in the 1500 block of North Gilmor Street. When the officers responded to the area, Mr. Woodland and another individual were standing near a red truck. As Detective Smith searched Mr. Woodland, he asked him if he had any information on drugs in the area. Mr. Woodland responded that he did. Detective Smith asked him if he would be willing to give that information to police, and Mr. Woodland responded that he would, but he was unable to do so at that time or place. Detective Smith responded: \u201cThat\u2019s fine. I\u2019m going to put you in handcuffs and we\u2019ll put you in the van.\u201d Mr. Woodland agreed. Detective Smith denied telling Mr. Woodland that he was going to \u201cteach him a lesson,\u201d nor did he threaten Mr. Woodland. Detective Smith stated that it is common for an officer to handcuff an individual in that high-crime area, even if they have not committed a crime, because the individual \u201cwouldn\u2019t want somebody to think that they\u2019re just giving police information.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b568-5\">Mr. Woodland got into the van voluntarily, and none of the officers in the van made any threatening statements. Mr. Woodland asked to be dropped off in East Baltimore because he had family in that area. Detective Smith explained that an informant would not want to be dropped off in the same neighborhood where he was picked up by police because individuals in that area would assume that he was giving information to police.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-6\">With respect to Mr. Johnson, Detective Smith testified that, after the incident with Mr. Woodland, he observed a male in the same neighborhood wearing a black hoodie and jeans <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>reaching into his waistband. As the officers drove around to investigate why the individual was reaching into his waistband, they saw Mr. Johnson and asked him if he had any information regarding drugs in the area. Mr. Johnson responded affirmatively. Detective Smith asked him to walk away from the van. Detective Smith then got out of the van and called for Mr. Johnson to come back. He did this for Mr. Johnson\u2019s safety, explaining that he \u201cdidn\u2019t want to make it look like he was just going to freely get in the van\u201d because he may be labeled as a \u201c \u2018snitch.\u2019 \u201d Detective Smith testified that none of the officers threatened Mr. Johnson, struck him with a nightstick, or broke his phone. The officers then drove Mr. Johnson in a \u201cbig circle\u201d while he gave the officers information. After gathering information, the officers asked Mr. Johnson where he would like to be dropped off. Mr. Johnson responded that he would like to be dropped off where the van was at that time, on Route 40 in Howard County. Mr. Johnson was not pushed out of the vehicle, and he had his shoes and socks on.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-5\">During cross-examination of Detective Smith, counsel for Mr. Johnson asked how often an individual would approach police officers in the Gilmor Homes area to give them information on criminal activity. Detective Smith\u2019s answers were: (1) \u201cit was pretty occasional\u201d; (2) it was not likely for somebody to approach officers in that area; and (3) a new informant would not \u201cnecessarily [approach] on a daily basis.\u201d After some discussion on this area of inquiry, the court informed counsel that it had received a jury note asking: \u201c \u2018If it wasn\u2019t common for an informant to come up daily, how did you come by two in one day?\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b569-6\">Detective Francis and Detective Hellen also testified. They generally corroborated Detective Smith\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-7\">The jury found in favor of Mr. Johnson and awarded compensatory and punitive damages against the officers, as follows.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>[[Image here]]</p>\n<p id=\"b570-78\">Appellants subsequently filed a motion for JNOV and a Motion for New Trial and Remittitur. They alleged, <em>inter alia, </em>that: (1) there was no competent evidence to support the jury\u2019s verdict that the injuries to Mr. Johnson were committed with malice; (2) the jury\u2019s deliberation was improperly prejudiced by the presence of malice on the verdict sheet; (3) the jury\u2019s verdict was improperly prejudiced by Mr. Woodland\u2019s testimony regarding his encounter with the officers; and (4) the jury\u2019s verdict was excessive and exceeded the cap imposed under the Local Government Tort Claims Act (\u201cLGTCA\u201d).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b571-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>The court granted, in part, and denied, in part, appellants\u2019 motions. It found that there was \u201csufficient evidence to support the jury\u2019s verdict in general, and specifically, the jury\u2019s finding of malice,\u201d noting that the defendants\u2019 \u201cown summary of the facts\u201d in their motion substantiated the jury\u2019s finding. The court stated that it properly exercised its discretion in admitting Mr. Woodland\u2019s testimony regarding his encounter with the defendants.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b571-5\">On the issue of the LGTCA\u2019s statutory cap, the court ruled: As to [Md.Code (2006 Repl.Vol.) \u00a7 5-301 <em>et seq. </em>of the Courts <em>&amp; </em>Judicial Proceedings Article (\u201cCJP\u201d) ], only the awards against Defendants Smith and Francis exceeded the statutory cap of $200,000. However, these Defendants are not entitled to any reduction as they were found to have acted with actual malice. Under [CJP] \u00a7 5-302(b)(2)(i), \u201c[a]n employee shall be fully liable for all damages awarded in an action in which it is found that the employee acted with actual malice.\u201d <em>See also Smith v. Danielczyk, </em>400 Md. 98, 130 [928 A.2d 795] (2007) (defendants are covered by [CJP] \u00a7\u00a7 5-301 <em>et seq. </em>\u201cso long as [intentional torts] were committed within the scope of employment and without actual malice\u201d). Consequently, these claims are without merit.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b571-6\">The court did, however, grant some relief on the amount of damages. The court struck the award of punitive damages against Detective Hellen, stating that the damages were awarded for false imprisonment, but he was found not liable for false imprisonment. It found, however, that the awards of punitive damages against Detectives Smith and Francis were not excessive.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-7\">On the issue of compensatory damages, the court found that the awards were \u201cgrossly excessive.\u201d It stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b571-8\">The Plaintiff was held against his will for approximately one hour.

Whitelock, </em>166 Md. App. 619, 643, 890 A.2d 899 (2006)], an award of $465,000 in compensatory damages was far above \u201cthe highest amount that a reasonable jury would award.\u201d This [c]ourt believes that an award of $300,000 in compensatory, non-economic damages was \u201cthe highest amount that a reasonable jury would award\u201d and would \u201censure that the award is a \u2018full and adequate compensation for the plaintiffs injuries.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 642-43 [890 A.2d 899], citing <em>Brawner v.

They assert that the evidence was unfairly prejudicial because it was \u201cunnecessary, lacked materiality and had no probative value,\u201d and it \u201ccould and likely did influence the jury to disregard the evidence or lack of evidence\u201d regarding the incident with Mr. Johnson.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-4\">Mr. Johnson contends that the trial court properly exercised its discretion in admitting Mr. Woodland\u2019s testimony, asserting that it \u201csought to prove a number of similarities to the circumstances surrounding the testimony elicited from\u201d Mr. Johnson, and it was offered \u201cprecisely to provide proof that [ajppellants\u2019 actions on the day in question supported the proposition that they were undertaking a common scheme or plan in taking juveniles against their will to teach them a lesson of respect for the police.\u201d He asserts that, given the temporal proximity of appellants\u2019 actions, and the \u201cextraordinarily similar methods employed by the officers as experienced by\u201d both Mr. Woodland and Mr. Johnson, the evidence was relevant to show a common course of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-5\">As the Court of Appeals explained in <em>State v. Simms, </em>420 Md. 705, 724-25, 25 A.3d 144 (2011), we review a trial court\u2019s decision to admit evidence for abuse of discretion, but we conduct an independent analysis of whether evidence is relevant:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b573-6\">It is frequently stated that the issue of whether a particular item of evidence should be admitted or excluded \u201cis committed to the considerable and sound discretion of the trial court,\u201d and that the \u201cabuse of discretion\u201d standard of review is applicable to \u201cthe trial court\u2019s determination of relevancy.\u201d Maryland Rule 5-402, however, makes it clear that the trial court does not have discretion to admit irrelevant evidence.... [T]he \u201cde novo\u201d standard of review is applicable to the trial judge\u2019s conclusion of law that the evidence at issue is or is not \u201cof consequence to the determination of the action.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b573-7\"><em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Ruffin Hotel Corp. of Md., </em>418 Md. at 619-20, 17 A.3d 676) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b574-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>Relevant evidence is \u201cevidence having any tendency to make the existence of any fact that is of consequence to the determination of the action more probable or less probable than it would be without the evidence.\u201d Md. Rule 5-401. \u201c[T]he relevancy determination is not made in isolation. Instead, the test of relevance is whether, in conjunction with all other relevant evidence, the evidence tends to make the proposition asserted more or less probable.\u201d <em>Snyder v. State, </em>361 Md. 580, 592, 762 A.2d 125 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b574-5\">Here, appellants\u2019 theory of the case was that Mr. Johnson had approached them to offer evidence of drug crimes in the area. Mr. Johnson offered Mr. Woodland\u2019s testimony to refute that theory, based on the similarity of the events, involving the same officers and the same location, and occurring within one hour of each other. We agree with the circuit court that the evidence of the similar incident involving Mr. Woodland was relevant to appellants\u2019 motive and intent, as well as whether Mr. Johnson gave his consent to the officers\u2019 actions. <em>See Espina v. Prince George\u2019s Cnty., </em>215 Md.App. 611, 653, 82 A.3d 1240 (2013) (evidence of two prior incidents where the defendant officer was involved in violent encounters with members of the public was admissible to show motive, intent, and <em>modus operandi, </em>as well as to rebut officer\u2019s testimony regarding his use of force), <em>cert. granted on other grounds, </em>438 Md. 142, 91 A.3d 613 (2014).</p>\n<p id=\"b574-6\">Once we conclude that the evidence was relevant, we next address whether the circuit court properly determined that the probative value substantially outweighed the danger of unfair prejudice. <em>See Brethren Mutual Ins. Co. v. Suchoza, </em>212 Md.App. 43, 52, 66 A.3d 1073 <em>cert. denied, </em>434 Md. 312, 75 A.3d 317 (2013); Md. Rule 5-403.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In balancing probative value against prejudice, we note that \u201c \u2018evidence that prejudices one party or the other, in the sense that it hurts his or her case, is not the undesirable prejudice referred to in Rule <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>5-403.\u2019 \u201d <em>Odum v.

Rather, evidence is considered unfairly prejudicial when \u201c \u2018it might influence the jury to disregard the evidence or lack of evidence regarding the particular crime with which [the defendant] is being charged.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id.</em><footnotemark><em>5</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b575-5\">Here, the court found that the evidence was highly probative because it \u201cgoes to the crux of this case, what exactly was the intent of the parties and whether or not the plaintiff consented.\u201d It concluded that its probative value \u201csignificantly outweigh[ed] any danger of unfair prejudice.\u201d We agree and certainly \u201ccannot say that the circuit court\u2019s decision to admit the evidence was \u2018removed from any center mark imagined by the reviewing court and beyond the fringe of what that court deems minimally acceptable.\u2019 \u201d <em>Espina, </em>215 Md.App. at 653, 82 A.3d 1240 (quoting <em>Consol. Waste Indus., Inc. v. Standard Equip. Co., </em>421 Md. 210, 219, 26 A.3d 352 (2011)). Accordingly, the circuit court did not abuse its discretion in admitting Mr. Woodland\u2019s testimony regarding his encounter with the police one hour before Mr. Johnson was put into the police van.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-7\">Damages</p>\n<p id=\"b575-8\">Appellants\u2019 next contentions are with respect to the damages award. As indicated, the court agreed that the compen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>satory damages awarded by the jury were excessive, and it ordered that a new trial would be granted unless Mr. Johnson agreed to a remittitur of $165,000 in damages, as follows: Detective Hellen \u2014 $32,000; Detective Smith \u2014 $136,000; and Detective Francis $132,000, for a total compensatory damages award of $300,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-5\">Appellants argue on appeal that the damages should be reduced further, for several reasons. First, they argue that the damages should be reduced pursuant to the LGTCA. Second, they argue that the jury damages award was improper because it was duplicative and \u201cirreconcilably inconsistent.\u201d Third, they argue that the award should have been reduced more because \u201ceven the revised $300,000 [was] excessive considering the testimony\u201d of Mr. Johnson.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-6\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-7\">LGTCA</p>\n<p id=\"b576-8\">Appellants contend that, pursuant to the LGTCA, Mr. Johnson\u2019s compensatory damages should have been limited to $200,000. They argue that, \u201cbecause the officers were acting in the scope of their duties, they are covered by the LGTCA and the local government entity \u2014 Baltimore City \u2014 is liable for any damages arising out of their actions.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> They assert that the trial court erred in holding that the LGTCA cap does not apply because the jury found that they acted with malice.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-9\">Mr. Johnson contends that the damage awards were not in excess of the LGTCA cap, noting that the case does not involve \u201can action against a local government.\u201d He states that, pursuant to CJP \u00a7 5 \u2014 302(b)(1), an employee of a local government \u201cshall be fully liable\u201d for damages awarded where it is determined that the employee acted with malice.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>Because our analysis hinges on the circuit court\u2019s interpretation and application of the LGTCA, we review the decision below <em>de novo.

Thus, although there is a cap on damages for the local government, where, as here, a police officer is found to have acted with actual malice, he is not shielded by immunity and is liable fully for <em>all damages awarded.</em><footnotemark><em>7</em></footnotemark><em> </em>The circuit court properly rejected the argument that the LGTCA required that the damages against the individual officers be capped at $200,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-6\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-7\">Duplicative and Inconsistent Awards</p>\n<p id=\"b579-8\">Appellants next contend that, \u201c[b]eyond the reduction mandated by the LGTCA statutory cap, Plaintiffs damages should have been reduced because they were duplicative.\u201d In support, they argue that, because \u201cthe incident in question constituted a continuous, single occurrence,\u201d the jury improperly awarded damages for both the constitutional claims and the common law claims on which they were premised, and it improperly \u201cmade multiple awards of punitive damages.\u201d They also assert that the jury\u2019s verdict was improper because it was \u201cirreconcilably inconsistent.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b579-9\">1.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-10\">Punitive Damages</p>\n<p id=\"b579-11\">We address first the argument regarding punitive damages. As indicated, the jury awarded $35,000 in punitive damages, as follows: (1) Detective Francis \u2014 $15,000\u2014$5,000 for the constitutional claim, $5,000 for false imprisonment, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number>$5,000 for assault; (2) Detective Smith \u2014 $19,000\u2014$5,000 for the constitutional claim, $5,000 for false imprisonment, $4,000 for battery, and $5,000 for assault; and (3) Detective Hellen\u2014 $1,000 for false imprisonment.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b580-5\">Mr. Johnson contends that the argument that there should have been only one award of punitive damages is not preserved for review because appellants made no objection to the form of the verdict sheet with regard to the \u201calleged duplication of the punitive damages,\u201d nor was this issue raised in post-trial motions. In any event, he argues that punitive damages awarded on each individual count was proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-6\">We will begin with the preservation argument. \u201cOrdinarily, the appellate court will not decide any [ ] issue unless it plainly appears by the record to have been raised in or decided by the trial court.\u201d Md. Rule 8-131. Moreover, pursuant to Md. Rule 2-522(b)(5), a party many not \u201cassign as error the submission of issues to the jury ... unless the party objects on the record before the jury retires to consider its verdict, stating distinctly the matter to which the party objects and the grounds of the objection.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b580-7\">Here, during discussions regarding the verdict sheet, which set forth a space for an amount of damages for each officer and each count, appellants did not make any argument, as they do on appeal, that \u201cmultiple awards of punitive damages for the single incident were improper as a matter of law.\u201d Nor did they make this argument in their motion for JNOV. Accordingly, because the issue now raised by appellants regarding punitive damages was not raised in or decided by the trial court, we shall not consider it.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-8\">2.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-9\">Compensatory Damages</p>\n<p id=\"b580-10\">We turn to the argument regarding compensatory damages. With respect to Detective Hellen, appellants argue that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"559\">*559</page-number>jury\u2019s verdict was \u201cirreconcilably inconsistent.\u201d With respect to Detectives Smith and Francis, appellants contend that the damage awards were duplicative.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-4\">a.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-5\">Detective Hellen</p>\n<p id=\"b581-6\">As indicated, the jury found Detective Hellen not liable for false imprisonment, battery, and assault but liable on the constitutional claim. Appellants assert that, \u201c[h]aving found that [Detective] Hellen did not take part in the unlawful acts and therefore having ruled out the only factual predicates for constitutional liability, the jury could not find [Detective] Hellen liable for the constitutional claim.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b581-7\">When the jury rendered this verdict, appellants could have raised this issue with the circuit court and asked the court to send the jury back to clarify what appellants believed to be an inconsistent verdict. Appellants, however, did not raise the issue below. In the context of inconsistent verdicts, it is clear that the failure to raise the issue in the circuit court constitutes a waiver of the right to raise the issue on appeal. <em>See Tate v. State, </em>182 Md.App. 114, 136, 957 A.2d 640 (to preserve the claim that a jury has rendered inconsistent verdicts, \u201ca defendant must note his objection to the inconsistent verdict while the trial court has an opportunity to remedy the error\u201d) (quoting <em>Price v. State, </em>405 Md. 10, 41-42, 949 A.2d 619 (2008)), <em>cert. denied, </em>406 Md. 747, 962 A.2d 373 (2008). Accordingly, this issue is not preserved for this Court\u2019s review.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-8\">b.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-9\">Detectives Francis and Smith</p>\n<p id=\"b581-10\">Appellants contend that compensatory damages awarded against Detectives Smith and Francis for the constitutional claim and the tort claims were duplicative because they were based on the same facts. As indicated, the jury awarded compensatory damages as follows: (1) Detective <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number>Francis \u2014 $100,000 for the constitutional claim,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> $100,000 for false imprisonment, and $5,000 for assault; (2) Detective Smith \u2014 $100,000 for the constitutional claim, $100,000 for false imprisonment, $5,000 for battery, and $5,000 for assault. Appellants argue that, because the counts were based on a single set of facts, they presented a single claim for damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-5\">Mr. Johnson argues that the damages were not duplicative. He baldly asserts, without elaboration, that the \u201csingle set of facts\u201d \u201cproduced a set of \u2018wrongs\u2019 independent of one another with different elements and separate claims for damages. He contends that the appellants\u2019 claim that the award for the constitutional violation was duplicative because it was based solely on a finding that appellants committed false imprisonment and assault is \u201cpure speculation as there is no evidence as to what formed the basis of the jury\u2019s finding constitutional violations, nor did the [ajppellants at any time ask to submit such an issue to the jury.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b582-6\">In this regard, appellants did argue below, during discussions regarding the verdict sheet, that the count for the constitutional claim should not be a separate count, as that count was subsumed by the substantive counts on the facts of the case. The circuit court was not persuaded, stating that it was \u201cappropriate for the [cjourt and [pjarties to know\u201d what the jury found regarding each count. The court did state, however, that \u201cmaybe this is something to visit if there is a verdict.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b582-7\">When the jury did come back with a verdict for Mr. Johnson, awarding damages for both the constitutional claim and the tort claims, appellants failed to argue, as they do on appeal, that the damages were improperly duplicative. It could be argued that, similar to an inconsistent verdict claim, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number>this type of argument is waived if not brought to the attention of the court when the verdict is rendered, when the court could have asked the jury to specify the basis for its finding, i.e., whether the damages awarded for the constitutional claim was based on the same facts as the tort claims. In this case, however, no such preservation argument was raised on appeal, and there was no argument below that the constitutional claim was based on facts different from those underlying the tort claims. Accordingly, we will address this issue on the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-5\">The Maryland appellate courts have made clear that there can be only one recovery of damages for one wrong or injury. <em>Smallwood v. Bradford, </em>352 Md. 8, 24, 720 A.2d 586 (1998) (\u201cDuplicative or overlapping recoveries in a tort action are not permissible.\u201d); <em>Shapiro v. Chapman, </em>70 Md.App. 307, 315, 520 A.2d 1330 (1987) (plaintiffs \u201cwould not have been permitted to recover twice for the same tort merely because the wrong gave rise to alternative theories of recovery\u201d). Here, we agree with appellants that the jury\u2019s verdict permitted Mr. Johnson to \u201crecover twice for the same tort merely because the wrong gave rise to alternative theories of recovery.\u201d <em>Shapiro, </em>70 Md.App. at 315, 520 A.2d 1330. The court\u2019s instructions to the jury, as well as the closing arguments of counsel, provided no basis for the jury to find a constitutional violation based on anything other than the facts supporting the tort claims. Accordingly, the $100,000 damages awarded on the constitutional claim was duplicative, and the compensatory damage awards should be revised as follows: (1) Detective Francis \u2014 $100,000 for false imprisonment and $5,000 for assault, for a total of $105,000; and (2) Detective Smith\u2014 $100,000 for false imprisonment, $5,000 for battery, and $5,000 for assault, for a total of $110,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-6\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-7\">Excessiveness</p>\n<p id=\"b583-8\">Appellants also argue that, \u201c[b]eyond all of\u2019 the foregoing, the court \u201cshould have found the award excessive and reduced it more than it did.\u201d In support, they state that Mr. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>Johnson presented no evidence of \u201cseeking, receiving, or needing psychological treatment.\u201d They cite no authority for the proposition that such evidence was required to support the jury\u2019s verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-4\">As appellants acknowledge, the circuit court has wide discretion regarding whether to reduce a verdict as excessive. <em>See John Crane Inc. v. Puller, </em>169 Md.App. 1, 52, 899 A.2d 879, <em>cert. denied, </em>394 Md. 479, 906 A.2d 943 (2006). A trial court abuses its discretion only when \u201c \u2018no reasonable person would take the view adopted by the [trial] court,\u2019 \u201d or when the court acts \u201c \u2018without reference to any guiding rules or principles.\u2019 \u201d <em>King v. State, </em>407 Md. 682, 697, 967 A.2d 790 (2009) (quoting <em>North v. North, </em>102 Md.App. 1, 13, 648 A.2d 1025 (1994)). Here, the court exercised its discretion to reduce the jury\u2019s verdict as excessive. We perceive no abuse of discretion by the trial court in its decision reducing the jury\u2019s verdict, which we have reduced further.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-6\">Malice</p>\n<p id=\"b584-7\">Appellants\u2019 final argument is that there was not sufficient evidence that the officers acted with actual malice. Accordingly, they request that this Court strike the award of punitive damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-8\">Mr. Johnson agrees that proof of malice is necessary to establish punitive damages, but he argues that he \u201cmet his burden of proof in proving malice by clear and convincing evidence.\u201d He asserts that there was \u201cample evidence to support the jury\u2019s finding of actual malice,\u201d stating that the jury could have found \u201cthat the appellants had the intent to inflict an injury upon [him], that they had acted at all times in concert and that such actions were with an improper motive of ill-will or with a motive other than bringing [Mr. Johnson] to justice.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b584-9\">The circuit court denied the motion for JNOV, finding that there was sufficient evidence to support the jury\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>finding of malice. \u201cA motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict [JNOV] under Rule 2-532 \u2018tests the legal sufficiency of the evidence.\u2019 \u201d <em>Gallagher v. H.V. Pierhomes, LLC, </em>182 Md.App. 94, 101, 957 A.2d 628 (2008) (quoting <em>Impala Platinum, Ltd. v. Impala Sales (USA), Inc., </em>283 Md. 296, 326, 389 A.2d 887 (1978)). \u201c \u2018[A] party is entitled to judgment notwithstanding the verdict ... when the evidence at the close of the case, taken in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party, does not legally support the nonmoving party\u2019s claim or defense.\u2019 \u201d <em>Elste v. ISG Sparrows Point, LLC, </em>188 Md.App. 634, 648, 982 A.2d 938 (2009) (quoting <em>Giant Food, Inc. v.

Jones, </em>197 Md.App. 638, 663, 14 A.3d 1223 (2011) (quoting <em>Washington Metro. Area, Transit Auth. v.

[T]hat motive or animus may exist even when the conduct is objectively reasonable.\u2019 <em>Shoemaker[, </em>353 Md. at 164, 725 A.2d 549]. Malice can be established by proof that the officer \u2018intentionally performed an act without legal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number>justification or excuse, but with an evil or rancorous motive influenced by hate, the purpose being to deliberately and willfully injure the plaintiff.\u2019 <em>Id. </em>at 163 [725 A.2d 549] (quoting <em>Leese v. Baltimore County, </em>64 Md.App. 442, 480 [497 A.2d 159] (1985), <em>cert. denied, </em>305 Md. 106 [501 A.2d 845] (1985)).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b586-5\"><em>Espina </em>215 Md.App. at 655, 82 A.3d 1240 (quoting <em>Thacker v. City of Hyattsville, </em>135 Md.App. 268, 300, 762 A.2d 172 (2000)). Malice may be inferred from the circumstances. <em>Leese, </em>64 Md.App. at 480, 497 A.2d 159.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-6\">Here, there was overwhelming evidence to support a finding of malice on the part of Detectives Smith and Francis. Appellants approached Mr. Johnson on the street and began questioning him. Detective Smith advised Mr. Johnson that if he looked at Detective Smith the wrong way, Detective Smith would \u201cram th[e] stick up [his] ass.\u201d Detective Smith then threw Mr. Johnson into the van, searched him for money, and broke his father\u2019s cell phone. Mr. Johnson testified that he was driven around for a couple of hours before being pushed out of the van in the rain, outside of the city limits, with no money, cell phone, shoes or socks. This evidence, along with the evidence of similar actions with respect to Mr. Woodland, was sufficient for the jury to find that appellants\u2019 actions were intentionally performed without legal justification or excuse, but with an evil or rancorous motive influenced by hate, and with the purpose to deliberately and willfully injure Mr. Johnson. There was no error by the circuit court in this regard.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-7\">JUDGMENT AFFIRMED, IN PART, REVERSED, IN PART.
