Appellant, Teleta S. Dashiell, filed a declaratory judgment action under the Maryland Public Information Act (\u201cMPIA\u201d or \u201cthe Act\u201d), seeking to establish that certain internal affairs records <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"651\">*651</page-number>prepared and stored by appellee, the Maryland State Police (the \u201cMSP\u201d), were not exempt from disclosure.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-5\">On November 5, 2009, appellant filed a complaint with the MSP against Sergeant John Maiello, alleging that Sergeant Maiello had made racially derogatory remarks while leaving a message on her voicemail two days earlier. Following an internal affairs investigation, appellant was notified on February 17, 2010, that her allegations were \u201cconfirmed\u201d and that \u201cappropriate disciplinary action was taken against Sergeant Maiello and documented in his personnel file.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b673-6\">After her subsequent MPIA request was denied by the MSP, appellant filed her declaratory judgment action in the circuit court. On June 24, 2011, following a motions hearing, the court ruled that all of the records sought by appellant were exempt from disclosure as \u201cpersonnel records\u201d under Section 10 \u2014 616(i) of the Act. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-7\">On appeal, appellant raises three questions, which we have rephrased:</p>\n<p id=\"b673-8\">1. Did the trial court err in granting summary judgment in favor of the MSP after finding that the documents sought by appellant under the Maryland Public Information Act were exempt from disclosure?</p>\n<p id=\"b673-9\">2. Did the trial court err by not ordering the MSP to produce those portions of the withheld documents that are \u201creasonably severable\u201d?</p>\n<p id=\"b673-10\">3. Did the trial court err by allowing MSP to withhold documents under the Maryland Public Information Act without first conducting an independent review of, or permitting discovery of, the documents?</p>\n<p id=\"b673-11\">For the reasons set forth below, we will vacate the judgment of the circuit court and remand this case to that court for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-12\">\n<em>BACKGROUND</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b673-13\">On November 3, 2009, during the investigation of a case to which he was assigned, Sergeant Maiello made a telephone <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"652\">*652</page-number>call to appellant, who was a potential witness. Unable to reach her, Sergeant Maiello left a voicemail message on appellant\u2019s telephone, asking her to call him back. Without realizing that he had not hung up the phone, Sergeant Maiello made racially disparaging remarks about appellant that were recorded on her voicemail system.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> After listening to the voicemail, appellant contacted the Princess Anne police barracks and, subsequently, came in to give a statement and file a complaint against Sergeant Maiello.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-5\">On February 17, 2010, appellant received correspondence from Captain Kristina Nelson of the Criminal Investigation Division, which explained that, following an internal investigation, appellant\u2019s complaint had been \u201csustained\u201d and that \u201cappropriate disciplinary action was taken against Sergeant Maiello and documented in his personnel file.\u201d Approximately one month later, on March 2, 2010, appellant, assisted by the American Civil Liberties Union of Maryland (\u201cACLU\u201d), filed a request for disclosure of records under the MPIA. Md.Code (1984, 2009 Repl. Vol.), \u00a7\u00a7 10-611 to -630 of the State Government Article (\u201cSG\u201d). In the records request, appellant sought</p>\n<blockquote id=\"akj-dedup-1\">[t]he internal investigation conducted by the Maryland State Police pursuant to the complaint lodged against Sergeant John Maiello by [appellant] on November 5, 2009, and closed the second week of February, 2010, relating to the offensive voicemail message left on [appellant\u2019s] cell phone on November 3, 2009, including, but not limited to:</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b674-6\">a.

Results of the review of findings of the internal investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-7\">On April 15, 2010, Internal Affairs Section Commander John Greene denied appellant\u2019s request in its entirety. In a response letter to the ACLU, Commander Greene explained:</p>\n<p id=\"ase-dedup-0\">MSP is denying [the] request for records for the following reasons:</p>\n<p id=\"b675-8\">\u2022 The Law Enforcement Officers\u2019 Bill of Rights (LEOBR) prohibits disclosure of internal investigation reports outside the context of that law.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-9\">\u2022 Records of an individual employee\u2019s conduct related to a specific incident are personnel records and are not disclosable under the [MPIA],</p>\n<p id=\"b675-10\">\u2022 The records you requested are intra-agency memoranda and letters and it would not be in the public interest to inhibit candor in the decision making process.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-11\">\u2022 The records you requested are investigatory records and it would not be in the public interest to inhibit the candor of witnesses or to invade the personal privacy of individuals involved in the investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-12\">Appellant disputed the MSP\u2019s decision to withhold the documents in their entirety, arguing in a June 7, 2010 letter that she was \u201centitled to review\u201d the investigative file generated by her complaint. Appellant then requested that the MSP be required \u201cto provide any reasonably \u2018severable portion\u2019 of the records sought.\u201d Appellant also \u201crequested] a detailed index of the investigative file that includes a summary of each document, and states the particular exemption that the MSP claims for each document\u201d within thirty days of the letter. The MSP denied this request, stating that \u201cthe nature of these records and the various bases upon which [the] MSP was compelled to deny the request makes it clear that no portion of the requested record is reasonably severable,\u201d and that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"654\">*654</page-number>MSP was not required to provide a detailed index because in its April 15 response, the MSP \u201csufficiently described the contents of the records to justify denial of access to the records without the need\u201d for any such index.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-4\">In the face of these denied requests, on October 27, 2010, appellant filed a complaint in the circuit court seeking (1) a declaratory judgment that the MSP violated the MPIA, (2) an order permitting her to inspect and copy the records she sought, and (8) an award of attorney\u2019s fees and costs. Before the beginning of discovery, the MSP moved to dismiss, or, in the alternative, for summary judgment. The circuit court held a hearing on June 24, 2011, at the conclusion of which the court orally granted the MSP\u2019s motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-5\">The circuit court explained its ruling as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b676-6\">This is a case where [appellant] filed suit against [the MSP] alleging violation of the Maryland Public Information Act. Suit was filed on October 27, 2010. Prior to filing suit, [appellant] inquired of [the MSP] as to what actions they had taken regarding this incident. The [MSP] w[as] required to respond on February 17, 2010.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b676-7\">[MSP employee] Captain Kristina Nelson sent a letter to [appellant] stating \u2014 I\u2019m not quoting \u2014 in response to her inquiry there was an investigative file created regarding [appellant\u2019s] complaint. Second, that [the MSP] confirmed [appellant\u2019s] allegations, and third, that appropriate disciplinary action was taken against Sergeant Maiello, and documented in his personnel file as stated in the letter of February 17, 2010.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b676-8\">Shortly thereafter, March 2, 2010, [appellant], through her counsel, requested, one \u2014 facts gathered during the investigation itself, [ ] an Internal Affairs Investigation. Two \u2014 witnesses\u2019 statements, [incident] reports, documents obtained or created during the investigation, and again, an Internal Affairs Investigation, the results of the Internal Affairs Investigation, and five [sic] \u2014 the results of the review findings of the Internal Investigation. That\u2019s what counsel is asking for. Basically, that\u2019s what the suit is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"655\">*655</page-number>asking for. All [ ] of these items are contained in the man\u2019s personnel file.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b677-4\">The law is very clear. The personnel record is confidential. The only exceptions that I see in the case law involve criminal cases, such as <em>Robinson v. State, </em>354 Md. 287 [730 A.2d 181 (1999) ], <em>Baltimore City Police v. State, </em>158 Md. App. 27[4, 857 A.2d 148 (2004) ]. These Internal Affairs Investigation records are clearly personnel records under Section 10-616, the State Government section of the annotated code.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b677-5\">It clearly states they shall deny \u2014 unless you got a criminal case involving constitutional issues usually related to the Sixth or Fourteenth Amendment. There\u2019s no question in my mind based upon [appellant\u2019s] attorney\u2019s requests they are looking for a result of an internal investigation by the [MSP], and everything they are looking for is personnel records which are confidential and are protected. Therefore, I\u2019m granting the motion for summary judgment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b677-6\">On June 28, 2011, the court entered a written order incorporating its ruling granting summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-7\">This timely appeal followed thereafter. Additional facts will be added as necessary to elucidate our discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-8\">\n<em>DISCUSSION</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b677-9\">The Court of Appeals set out the appellate standard of review for a grant of summary judgment in <em>Tyler v. City of College Park:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b677-10\">Whether a circuit court\u2019s grant of summary judgment is proper in a particular case is a question of law, subject to a non-deferential review on appeal. As such, in reviewing a grant of summary judgment, we review independently the record to determine whether the parties generated a dispute of material fact and, if not, whether the moving party was entitled to judgment as a matter of law. We review the record in the light most favorable to the non-moving party and construe any reasonable inferences that may be drawn from the well-plead facts against the moving party.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b678-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"656\">*656</page-number>415 Md. 475, 498, 8 A.3d 421 (2010) (citations omitted). Ordinarily, we \u201cconsider only the grounds upon which the trial court relied in granting summary judgment.\u201d <em>Ross v. State Bd. of Elections, </em>387 Md. 649, 667, 876 A.2d 692 (2005) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b678-4\">In the MPIA, the General Assembly codified a general right to public information. <em>See </em>SG \u00a7\u00a7 10-611 to -630. Both on its face and as established by case law, the Act \u201cshall be construed in favor of permitting inspection of a public record.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 10-612(b); <em>see Kirwan v. Diamondback, </em>352 Md. 74, 81, 721 A.2d 196 (1998) (noting that the Act \u201cmust be liberally construed in order to effectuate the Public Information Act\u2019s broad remedial purpose\u201d) (citations and internal quotation marks omitted). \u201c[T]he provisions of the Public Information Act reflect the legislative intent that citizens of the State of Maryland be accorded wide-ranging access to public information concerning the operation of their government.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 81, 721 A.2d 196 (citations and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b678-5\">Of course, there are exceptions (in the form of exemptions) to the general rule favoring disclosure. The presumption of public access does not apply in limited situations where \u201can unwarranted invasion of the privacy of a person in interest would result.\u201d SG \u00a7 10-612(b). As a public agency, the MSP has the burden of sustaining its decision to deny the inspection of a public record. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 10 \u2014 623(b)(2)(i); <em>see also Fioretti v. Bd. of Dental Exam\u2019rs, </em>351 Md. 66, 78, 716 A.2d 258 (1998). The agency may not assert a generic \u201cunwarranted invasion of privacy\u201d or \u201cpersonal information\u201d exemption to disclosure; only the codified exemptions, where applicable, are a valid basis for withholding public records. <em>Office of the Governor v. Washington Post Co., </em>360 Md. 520, 554, 759 A.2d 249 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b678-6\">Sections 10-615 through 10-618 of the Act provide the four statutory categories of exemptions. Sections 10-615, 10-616, and 10-617 each set forth \u201crequired denials\u201d stating that, for all public records that fall into those categories, the records custodian <em>\u201cshall </em>deny inspection\u201d (emphasis added). Section 10-618 sets forth \u201cpermissible denials\u201d that vest dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"657\">*657</page-number>cretion in the custodian to deny inspection \u201cif [the] custodian believes that inspection of a part of a public record by the applicant would be contrary to the public interest.\u201d In sum, \u201cif any exemption under \u00a7\u00a7 10-615, 10-616, or 10-617 is applicable to a particular record, then it must be withheld. Moreover, if the record is exempt under the provisions of \u00a7 10-618(a) ..., then it may be withheld at the discretion of the custodian.\u201d <em>Office of Attorney General v. Gallagher, </em>359 Md. 341, 354-55, 753 A.2d 1036 (2000). Furthermore, the exemption provisions are not mutually exclusive; that is, documents for which disclosure may be permitted under one section must still be withheld if covered by another mandatory exemption. <em>Id. </em>at 354, 753 A.2d 1036.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-4\">When faced with an MPIA dispute, a trial court \u201cmust interpret the [Act\u2019s] exemptions narrowly.\u201d <em>Fioretti, </em>351 Md. at 77, 716 A.2d 258. \u201cThe Public Information Act\u2019s strong preference for public access to government documents must be considered whenever a court is applying the particular provisions of the statute.\u201d <em>Md. Dep\u2019t of State Police v. Md. State Conference of NAACP Branches, </em>430 Md. 179, 191, 59 A.3d 1037 (2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b679-5\">The public records at issue in the present case concern an internal affairs investigation into appellant\u2019s allegations that Sergeant Maiello, one of the MSP\u2019s officers, made racially insensitive and derogatory remarks to appellant in a voicemail left on appellant\u2019s phone. The Court of Appeals recently explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b679-6\">An internal investigation is initiated by a \u201ccomplaint\u201d or \u201callegation of misconduct made against an employee of the department.\u201d The Director of the Internal Affairs Division reviews the complaint and determines whether it merits further investigation. If it does, the Director then assigns the complaint to an investigator, typically a commanding officer, tasked with gathering \u201call available documentary evidence\u201d and compiling an \u201cInternal Investigative Report,\u201d which contains the allegations, a written report of any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"658\">*658</page-number>information uncovered by the investigation, and a list of all those contacted or interviewed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b680-5\"><em>Montgomery Cnty. v. Shropshire, </em>420 Md. 362, 374, 23 A.3d 205 (2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b680-6\">According to the MSP\u2019s Administrative Manual, complaints are documented by a police employee on a \u201cForm 176,\u201d which is entitled \u201cComplaint Against Personnel.\u201d Md. State Police Admin. Manual, ch. 5, \u00a7 V(D)(3)(b) (rev. Aug. 20, 2004) (\u201cthe MSP Manual\u201d). Form 176 is then submitted to the Internal Affairs Section (\u201cthe IAS\u201d), which opens a new case file for that complaint and assigns a tracking number to that file. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 111(E)(1),(F)(1), V(E)(4). The commander of the employee against whom the complaint is filed then confers with the IAS Commander, who has the authority to decide who investigates the complaint (either the IAS or a \u201clocal investigator\u201d). <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 V(E)(4). Whoever is assigned to investigate the complaint must interview the complainant and witnesses, interrogate the employee(s), explore all leads, examine all physical evidence, and provide an investigative report. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 V(H)(1). Once completed, an investigation case file will contain the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b680-7\">a. Complaint Against Personnel Report, Form 176</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b680-8\">b.

Offenses subjecting an officer(s) to discipline are classified internally into five categories, \u201cA\u201d through \u201cE,\u201d with Category A offenses being the least severe, and Category E offenses considered the most severe. The discipline assessed ranges from formal counseling to reassignment for Category A offenses, to demotion or termination for Category E offenses. MSP Manual, ch. 5, \u00a7 XIII. An officer against whom discipline is assessed may appeal to the Internal Investigative Review Panel. <em>Shropshire, </em>420 Md. at 374, 23 A.3d 205.

Comm\u2019n 307 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b681-8\">We now turn to evaluate whether appellant has a right to inspect the records that she seeks under the MPIA. As explained above, the MSP issued a categorical, \u201cblanket denial\u201d of appellant\u2019s records request pertaining to the investigation of the incident involving Sergeant Maiello and appellant. The MSP stated four separate bases for its denial \u2014 namely, that the records were: (1) personnel records; (2) records for which disclosure would violate the Law Enforcement Officers\u2019 Bill of Rights (\u201cthe LEOBR\u201d); (3) intra-agency memoranda and letters; and/or (4) investigatory records. The circuit court ultimately concluded that all of the records were \u201cpersonnel records\u201d without analyzing the MSP\u2019s other bases. Because we determine, as will be discussed <em>infra, </em>that the court\u2019s judgment must be vacated and the case remanded for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"660\">*660</page-number>further proceedings, our discussion will include all of the MSP\u2019s bases for the guidance of the trial court upon remand. <em>See </em>Md. Rule 8-131(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b682-4\">\n<em>A. Is Appellant a \u201cPerson in Interest\u201d?</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b682-5\">We begin our analysis by evaluating whether appellant, as the complainant in the instant case, is a \u201cperson in interest\u201d under the MPIA. Appellant contends that she is a \u201cperson in interest\u201d as defined by the MPIA. The MSP disagrees. We concur with the MSP.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-6\">The significance of this initial determination is that the agency must make a heightened showing in order to deny inspection to a \u201cperson in interest\u201d relative to a member of the general public. <em>Compare </em>SG \u00a7 10 \u2014 616(i)(1) (requiring denial of inspection of personnel records) <em>with </em>SG \u00a7 10 \u2014 616(i)(2) (requiring granting of inspection to \u201cthe person in interest\u201d). <em>See also Gun Ban II, </em>329 Md. at 96-97, 617 A.2d 1040 (explaining that denying inspection under SG \u00a7 10-618(f)(2) to \u201cthe person in interest\u201d is only permissible based on seven enumerated circumstances, whereas \u00a7 10 \u2014 618(f)(1) only requires showing that \u201cinspection would be contrary to the public interest\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b682-7\">As defined by SG \u00a7 10-611(e)(1), a \u201cperson in interest\u201d is \u201ca person or governmental unit that is the subject of a public record,\u201d or that person\u2019s designee. In <em>Gun Ban II, </em>the Maryland Committee Against the Gun Ban (\u201cthe Committee\u201d), a political committee, sought records of the Internal Investigation Division (IID) of the Baltimore City Police Department based on an investigation into two officers\u2019 alleged use of excessive force and other misconduct. 329 Md. at 84, 617 A.2d 1040. In addition to considering the text of the Act, the Court of Appeals quoted at length from the legislative history of the Act, including the 1975 Senate Committee Report, which stated that the Senate Committee \u201c \u2018deemed it both necessary and preferable to provide for some type of outside vigilance wherein citizens are afforded the right to view those materials in the possession of law enforcement agencies <em>respecting them personally.\u2019 \u201d Id. </em>at 94, 617 A.2d 1040 (quoting <em>Report to the </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"661\">*661</page-number><em>Senate of Maryland, Senate Investigating Committee Established Pursuant to Senate Resolutions 1 and 151 of the 1975 Maryland General Assembly </em>(1975)). Reversing our decision and affirming the trial court, the Court held that the Committee was not a \u201cperson in interest,\u201d because it was \u201cnot \u2018the subject of the IID report.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 90, 617 A.2d 1040 (quoting SG \u00a7 10 \u2014 611(e)). The Court reasoned that \u201c[t]he fact that individual persons who were working toward the goal of the Committee, either as volunteers, paid employees, or independent contractors, interfaced with the police officers who thereby became subjects of the investigation is insufficient to make the Committee a \u2018person in interest.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 91, 617 A.2d 1040.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-5\">We followed the Court of Appeals\u2019 guidance the following year in <em>Briscoe v. Mayor of Baltimore, </em>100 Md.App. 124, 640 A.2d 226 (1994). The appellant in <em>Briscoe, </em>like appellant in the case <em>sub judice, </em>was a complainant who accused two police officers of excessive force and misconduct, and was the person who prompted an internal police investigation. Ultimately, the police department concluded that the allegations were not sustained. <em>Id. </em>at 126, 640 A.2d 226. After noting that the Court of Appeals \u201cleft open the question of whether a complaining victim or witness may be considered the subject of an investigation\u201d in <em>Gun Ban II, </em>we quoted the Court of Appeals\u2019 statement that \u201c \u2018[t]he Act\u2019s history covering reports of police investigations also makes clear that the \u2018person in interest\u2019 referred to in \u00a7 10 \u2014 618(f)(2) is the person who is investigated.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 130, 640 A.2d 226 (quoting <em>Gun Ban II, </em>329 Md. at 92, 617 A.2d 1040). Applying that reasoning, we concluded that the \u201cappellant is not the person who was investigated and thus not a person in interest under the Act.\u201d <em>Briscoe, </em>100 Md.App. at 130, 640 A.2d 226.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b684-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"662\">*662</page-number>Appellant argues that we should distinguish <em>Briscoe, </em>because the allegations of misconduct in <em>Briscoe </em>were not sustained, while appellant\u2019s allegations in the instant case were sustained. Such distinction, in our view, has no bearing on whether a complainant is or is not a \u201cperson in interest.\u201d A \u201cperson in interest\u201d relates to the status of an individual, not to the veracity of the allegations of misconduct.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Like the appellant in <em>Briscoe, </em>appellant here is the complainant who triggered the investigation by the MSP, and not the subject of the investigation itself.

Applicability of the LEOBR</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"Akx\">The MSP argues that, because of the LEOBR, it was required to refuse inspection as \u201ccontrary to a State statute,\u201d pursuant to SG \u00a7 10 \u2014 615(2)(i).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The MSP claims that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"663\">*663</page-number>LEOBR \u201cconfirms the public interest in protecting the confidentiality\u201d of the documents here.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-4\">Appellant counters that SG \u00a7 10-615 does not apply, because the LEOBR, although a state statute, does not control her situation. Appellant contends that the LEOBR is intended only to provide procedural guarantees to law enforcement officers in internal investigations and that, because she is a public complainant, the LEOBR is irrelevant.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-5\">In <em>Shropshire, </em>the Court of Appeals explained that \u201c[internal investigations of law enforcement officers are governed by ... the Law Enforcement Officers\u2019 Bill of Rights (LEOBR).\u201d 420 Md. at 373, 23 A.3d 205. Indeed, as explained by the Court, \u201cSection 3-104 of the Public Safety Article is controlling whenever a law enforcement officer is under investigation or subjected to interrogation by a law enforcement agency \u2018for a reason that may lead to disciplinary action, demotion, or dismissal.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>The Court specifically declined, however, to reach the MSP\u2019s argument that the records of such investigations were confidential \u201cby virtue of\u2019 the LEOBR. <em>Id. </em>at 375 n. 14, 23 A.3d 205.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-6\">In our view, the LEOBR does not govern whether documents from an internal investigation are subject to disclosure to third parties under the MPIA. In <em>Baltimore City Police Department v. State, </em>Judge Mary Ellen Barbera (now Chief Judge of the Court of Appeals), writing for this Court, stated that \u201cthe protections afforded an officer under these provisions [of the LEOBR] have been determined by the Court of Appeals to have very little bearing on the discoverability question\u201d under the MPIA. 158 Md.App. 274, 283, 857 A.2d 148 (2004). In support of her statement, Judge Barbera quoted from <em>Robinson v. State, </em>354 Md. 287, 308, 730 A.2d 181 (1999), where the Court of Appeals explained that the provisions of the LEOBR \u201c \u2018deal only with the rights of the <em>officer </em>and serve as a protection for them.\u2019 \u201d <em>Balt. City Police Dep\u2019t, </em>158 Md.App. at 285, 857 A.2d 148 (emphasis added). Although <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"664\">*664</page-number>the LEOBR serves as support for the individual officer\u2019s interest in maintaining confidentiality, we are called upon here to focus our inquiry on the rights of the <em>complainant. </em>Mindful of the admonition that \u201cthe [MPIA] should be interpreted to favor disclosure,\u201d <em>Kirwan, </em>352 Md. at 84, 721 A.2d 196, we conclude that disclosure would not be contrary to the LEOBR under SG \u00a7 10-615(2)(i).</p>\n<p id=\"b686-5\">\n<em>C. Are the Requested Documents Exempt from Disclosure under the MPIA?</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b686-6\">Appellant argues that the trial court erred by allowing the MSP to withhold the documents as \u201cpersonnel records\u201d under SG \u00a7 10-616(i). Appellant also contends that the documents should have been analyzed as \u201cinvestigatory files,\u201d pursuant to SG \u00a7 10 \u2014 618(f) and \u201cintra-agency memoranda\u201d under SG \u00a7 10-618(b). In support of her argument, appellant cites to this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Maryland Department of State Police v. Maryland State Conference of NAACP Branches, </em>190 Md. App. 359, 988 A.2d 1075, (2010), <em>aff'd on other grounds, </em>430 Md. 179, 59 A.3d 1037 (2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b686-7\">The MSP responds by asserting that the trial court properly classified the records as \u201cpersonnel records\u201d under SG \u00a7 10 \u2014 616(i). The MSP argues that <em>Shropshire </em>compels the finding that the internal affairs investigation files are \u201cpersonnel records.\u201d In reply, appellant disputes the breadth of <em>Shropshire, </em>arguing that it is distinguishable, because the conduct that was the subject of the internal affairs investigation in that case was \u201cunfounded allegations of administrative rule violations not prompted by any citizen complaint.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b686-8\">Under SG \u00a7 10 \u2014 616(i), \u201ca custodian shall deny inspection,\u201d except to \u201cthe person in interest,\u201d \u201cof a personnel record of an individual, including an application, performance rating, or scholastic achievement information.\u201d This exemption is \u201cintended to address the reasonable expectation of privacy that a person in interest has\u201d in his or her personnel records. <em>Univ. Sys. of Md. v. Balt. Sun Co., </em>381 Md. 79, 99-100, 847 A.2d 427 (2004). The Court of Appeals has explained that, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"665\">*665</page-number>although the listed examples in the statute (employment application, performance rating, and scholastic achievement information) were \u201cprobably not intended to be exhaustive, [the list] does reflect a legislative intent that \u2018personnel records\u2019 mean those documents that directly pertain to employment and an employee\u2019s ability to perform a job.\u201d <em>Kirwan, </em>352 Md. at 82-83, 721 A.2d 196.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-4\">In <em>Kirwan, </em>the Court of Appeals held that the parking tickets of University of Maryland basketball coach Gary Williams were not \u201cpersonnel records\u201d under the Act because they \u201cdo not relate to Coach Williams\u2019s hiring, discipline, promotion, dismissal, or any matter involving his status as an employee.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 83, 721 A.2d 196. The Court again expounded on the meaning of \u201cpersonnel records\u201d in <em>Office of the Governor v. Washington Post Co., </em>360 Md. 520, 759 A.2d 249 (2000). There, the Court held, in part, that telephone numbers and in-person meetings involving the Governor on the subject of appointed executive positions were not personnel records because they \u201cwould not relate to the discipline, promotion, dismissal, status, job performance, or achievement of an existing or former employee.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 548, 759 A.2d 249.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-5\">In <em>Shropshire, </em>the Montgomery County Inspector General sought to inspect records from an internal affairs investigation involving two police officers. 420 Md. at 364, 23 A.3d 205. The investigation was conducted after a complaint was filed alleging that the officers violated administrative rules in the process of responding to an automobile accident involving a local fireman. <em>Id. </em>at 366, 23 A.3d 205. The Court concluded that, \u201cbecause the internal affairs records involving [the individual officers] related to employee discipline, the records are indeed \u2018personnel records\u2019 exempt from disclosure pursuant to Section 10 \u2014 616(i) of the State Government Article.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 381, 23 A.3d 205. In support of this conclusion, the Court reasoned that, \u201cwhere, as here, an investigation clears the officers of wrongdoing, there is a significant public interest in maintaining confidentiality, both in fairness to the investigated officers and cooperating witnesses.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The Court explained that \u201c \u2018[mistaken or even deliberately false reports and accu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"666\">*666</page-number>sations are made against ... [i]n some instances, the most conscientious and hardworking members\u2019 \u201d of the police department. <em>Id. </em>at 380, 23 A.3d 205 (alterations in original) (quoting <em>Gun Ban II, </em>329 Md. at 84, 617 A.2d 1040.). Thus \u201c \u2018fairness to the investigated officers and the avoidance of needless publicity to the cooperating witnesses, with possible inhibiting effects on future investigations, justify on public interest grounds the custodian\u2019s denial of inspection to one other than a person in interest.\u2019 \u201d <em>Shropshire, </em>420 Md. at 380, 23 A.3d 205 (quoting <em>Gun Ban II, </em>329 Md. at 95, 617 A.2d 1040). In addition, the Court noted that records of internal investigations contain significant personal information about the investigated officer and other information \u201cthat if disclosed, could be potentially detrimental to not only the officers, but also the witnesses.\u201d <em>Shropshire, </em>420 Md. at 381, 23 A.3d 205. In a footnote to the opinion, however, the Court expressly stated that it was \u201cnot addressing] whether records of \u2018sustained\u2019 complaints may be disclosed to a County\u2019s Inspector General.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 374 n. 12, 23 A.3d 205.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-4\">At first blush, the Court of Appeals\u2019 decision in <em>Shropshire </em>would support the trial court\u2019s grant of summary judgment in favor of the MSP on the grounds that the records of the internal investigation against Sergeant Maiello are \u201cpersonnel records\u201d within the meaning of SG \u00a7 10 \u2014 616(i), and thus exempt from disclosure. The trial court, however, did not have the benefit of the recent Court of Appeals\u2019 opinion in <em>NAACP Branches, </em>430 Md. 179, 59 A.3d 1037. As we will explain below, <em>NAACP Branches </em>requires the trial court to determine whether each requested document in the investigatory record is exempt from disclosure under any provision of the MPIA advanced by the MSP, and if exempt, whether any such document is subject to disclosure as severable under SG \u00a7 10 \u2014 614(b) (3) (iii).</p>\n<p id=\"b688-5\">In <em>NAACP Branches, </em>the NAACP requested under the MPIA certain records from the MSP regarding the MSP\u2019s compliance with a federal consent order that was \u201cdesigned to ensure that State Police officers did not rely on racial attributes when deciding whether to conduct a traffic stop and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"667\">*667</page-number>search.\u201d 430 Md. at 182, 59 A.3d 1037. The MSP produced many of the documents requested, but declined to produce documents that were \u201cobtained or created in connection with any complaint of racial profiling, including but not limited to any complaint filed with or investigated by the MSP\u2019s ... Department of Internal Affairs.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 183, 59 A.3d 1037. The MSP stated that such documents were \u201cpersonnel records\u201d and thus exempt from disclosure under SG \u00a7 10-616(i). <em>Id. </em>In response, the NAACP indicated that it was not seeking confidential personal information of a particular trooper and agreed to a redaction of the documents such that a particular trooper\u2019s identify would not be divulged. <em>Id. </em>at 183-84, 59 A.3d 1037. The MSP rejected this request, again relying on the \u201cpersonnel records\u201d exemption from disclosure under SG \u00a7 10-616(i). <em>Id. </em>at 184, 59 A.3d 1037.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-4\">The NAACP then brought suit in the circuit court against the MSP for violation of the MPIA. <em>Id. </em>The trial judge ordered the submission of the disputed records for his <em>in camera </em>review. <em>Id. </em>After <em>in camera </em>review, the trial judge determined that the records were \u201cpersonnel in nature,\u201d but that the records should be disclosed \u201cprovided that the names and any identification number of individual Maryland State Police troopers and the names and identifying information of any complainants are redacted from such records.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 184-85, 59 A.3d 1037.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-5\">On appeal, a majority of this Court, sitting <em>en banc, </em>held that the requested records, without any redactions, did not constitute \u201cpersonnel records of an individual\u201d within the meaning of SG \u00a7 10-616(i). <em>Md. Dep\u2019t of State Police v. Md. State Conference of NAACP Branches, </em>190 Md.App. 359, 375, 988 A.2d 1075 (2010). This Court reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b689-6\">Racial profiling complaints against Maryland State Troopers do not involve private matters concerning intimate details of the trooper\u2019s private life. Instead, such complaints involve events occurring while the trooper is on duty and engaged in public service. As such, the files at issue concern public actions by agents of the State concerning <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"668\">*668</page-number>affairs of government, which are exactly the types of material the Act was designed to allow the public to see.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b690-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 368, 988 A.2d 1075.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-6\">We also held that the requested records constituted \u201crecords of investigations conducted by ... a police department\u201d within the meaning of SG \u00a7 10 \u2014 618(f) and that, although such records could be exempt from disclosure under SG \u00a7 10-618(a), the MSP\u2019s reliance on SG \u00a7 10 \u2014 616(i) instead of SG \u00a7 10-618(a) precluded its denial of disclosure on that ground.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 370-71, 988 A.2d 1075. Accordingly, this Court upheld the circuit court\u2019s order requiring the disclosure of the redacted records. <em>Id. </em>at 380-81, 988 A.2d 1075.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-7\">Upon a grant of a writ of certiorari, the Court of Appeals affirmed the judgment of this Court, but on different grounds. 430 Md. at 190, 59 A.3d 1037. The Court rejected our focus on whether the <em>unredacted </em>requested records were \u201cpersonnel records\u201d within the meaning of SG \u00a7 10 \u2014 616(i). <em>Id. </em>at 193-94, 59 A.3d 1037. The issue, according to the Court, was whether the <em>redacted </em>records constituted \u201cpersonnel records\u201d under SG \u00a7 10-616(i). <em>Id. </em>at 194, 59 A.3d 1037. The Court resolved that issue in two sentences: \u201cAfter the names of State Police troopers, the names of complainants, and all identifying information are redacted, the records clearly do not fall within the statutory language of \u2018record[s] of an individual.\u2019 (\u00a7 10-616(i)). There would be no \u2018individual\u2019 identified in the redacted records.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 195, 59 A.3d 1037. In other words, the redactions removed the records from the definition of \u201cperson<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"669\">*669</page-number>nel records\u201d under SG \u00a7 10 \u2014 616(i), and thus made them subject to disclosure.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-4\">In addition, the Court held that, even if the records remained \u201cpersonnel records\u201d after the redactions, the custodian must disclose such records if they are \u201creasonably severable\u201d under SG \u00a7 10-614(b)(3)(iii). The Court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b691-5\">Moreover, \u00a7 10-616(a) [&amp;] (i) of the Public Information Act provides as follows (emphasis added):</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b691-6\">\u201c(a) <em>In general. </em>\u2014 Unless otherwise provided by law, a custodian shall deny inspection of a public record, as provided in this section.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b691-7\">(i) <em>Personnel records. </em>\u2014 (1) Subject to paragraph (2) of this subsection, a custodian shall deny inspection of a personnel record of an individual, including an application, performance rating, or scholastic achievement information.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b691-8\">Section 10 \u2014 614(b)(3)(iii) of the Act is a statutory provision \u201cotherwise provided by law.\u201d It states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b691-9\">\u201c(3) A custodian who denies the application shall:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b691-10\">(iii) permit inspection of any part of the record that is subject to inspection and is reasonably severable.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b691-11\">The plain language of \u00a7\u00a7 10-616(a) and 10-614(b)(3)(iii) authorizes redactions so that the applicant can receive portions of an exempt record which are severable and the receipt of which does not violate the substance of the exemption.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b691-12\"><em>Id. </em>at 195, 59 A.3d 1037 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b691-13\">Finally, the Court of Appeals rejected this Court\u2019s assertion that, if records are subject to disclosure under one section of the MPIA, they cannot be exempt from disclosure under another section of the Act. <em>Id. </em>at 191, 59 A.3d 1037. The Court cited to <em>Gallagher, </em>wherein it held \u201c \u2018that \u00a7 10 \u2014 618(f) does not overrule other exemptions under the Act\u2019 and that, \u2018if any exemption under \u00a7\u00a7 10-615, 10-616, or 10-617 is applica<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"670\">*670</page-number>ble to a particular record, then it must be withheld.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 192, 59 A.3d 1037 (quoting <em>Gallagher, </em>359 Md. at 354-55, 753 A.2d 1036). The Court then stated that the severability-provision of SG \u00a7 10 \u2014 614(b)(3)(iii) applied to each of the Act\u2019s exemptions. The Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b692-4\">If a record falling within one of the Act\u2019s exemptions is redacted in accordance with \u00a7 10-614(b)(3)(iii) and, if it is still exempt as argued by the State Police and held by the Court of Special Appeals, no effect whatsoever would be given to \u00a7 10 \u2014 614(b)(3)(iii). The State Police\u2019s and the Court of Special Appeals\u2019 position would largely render \u00a7 10 \u2014 614(b)(3)(iii) nugatory____Furthermore, as shown by this Court\u2019s opinions, \u00a7 10 \u2014 614(b)(3)(iii) is not nugatory. <em>See Governor v.

In response, the MSP claimed that all of the requested documents were exempt from disclosure under the Act as \u201cpersonnel records\u201d under SG \u00a7 10-616(i), as \u201crecords of investigations conducted by a police department\u201d under SG \u00a7 10-618(f), and as \u201cintra-agency memoranda\u201d under SG \u00a7 10-618(b).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Under <em>NAACP Branches, </em>the trial court was required to determine whether the requested documents were exempt from disclosure under any provision of the MPIA asserted by the MSP. <em>See </em>430 Md. at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"671\">*671</page-number>194-96, 59 A.3d 1037. Here, the trial court ruled that all of the requested documents were exempt from disclosure as \u201cpersonnel records\u201d under SG \u00a7 10 \u2014 616(i). The trial court did not decide whether the requested documents were exempt from disclosure under the Act as \u201crecords of investigations conducted by a police department\u201d or \u201cintra-agency memoran-da.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b693-4\">In making its ruling, however, the circuit court did not require the MSP to create an index of the withheld <em>documents</em><footnotemark><em>7</em></footnotemark><em> </em>and did not review any of such documents <em>in camera. </em>Indeed, in its motion to dismiss, or in the alternative, for summary judgment, the MSP failed to identify the documents that it withheld from disclosure, nor did the MSP provide any detailed information about each such document. It is difficult for us to see how the trial court could properly determine the applicability of any exemption under the Act without having detailed information about each document withheld or conducting an <em>in camera </em>review of all such documents. <em>See Cranford v. Montgomery Cnty., </em>300 Md. 759, 779, 481 A.2d 221 (1984) (stating that the agency must \u201cpresent a sufficiently detailed description and explanation to enable the trial court to rule whether a given document, or portion thereof, is exempt\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b693-5\">In addition, appellant specifically stated in her MPIA request that, \u201cif you determine that some portions of the requested records are exempt from disclosure ..., we will expect, as the Act requires in \u00a7 10 \u2014 614(b)(3)(iii), that you provide us with \u2018any reasonable severable portion\u2019 of the records sought.\u201d The MSP rejected appellant\u2019s request for the disclosure of the severable portion of the requested documents, claiming, without any explanation, \u201cthat no portion of the requested record is reasonably severable.\u201d Under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"672\">*672</page-number><em>NAACP Branches, </em>the plain language of the Act authorizes appellant to \u201creceive portions of an exempt record which are severable and the receipt of which does not violate the substance of the exemption.\u201d 430 Md. at 195, 59 A.3d 1037. Unfortunately, the trial court failed to decide whether any portion of the requested documents that are exempt from disclosure are, nevertheless, severable and thus subject to disclosure.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-5\">Given the state of the record before us in the instant case, we conclude that we cannot conduct a review of the legality or propriety of the MSP\u2019s refusal to disclose the requested documents in the investigative file created as a result of appellant\u2019s complaint. Without the identification of each withheld document, along with detailed information about it, appellant was not able to develop cogent arguments regarding whether a particular document is exempt or severable. Without such identification and detailed information, or an <em>in camera </em>review of the withheld documents, the trial court did not have a sufficient factual basis to determine the applicability of an exemption to such documents, and if exempt, the severability of any portion thereof. Finally, the lack of identification and information about the withheld documents precluded the trial court from determining, as occurred in <em>NAACP Branches, </em>whether any redactions agreed to by appellant would remove a particular document from an exemption or would make such document severable from other exempt documents.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Accordingly, we must vacate the judg<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"673\">*673</page-number>ment of the circuit court and remand the instant case for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-5\">JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR BALTIMORE COUNTY VACATED; CASE REMANDED TO THAT COURT FOR FURTHER PROCEEDINGS CONSISTENT WITH THIS OPINION.

The only issue before this Court in <em>Briscoe </em>was whether the appellant was a \"person in interest\u201d within the meaning of SG \u00a7 10-611(e)(1) of the MPIA. <em>Briscoe v. Mayor of Balt., </em>100 Md.App. 124, 130, 640 A.2d 226 (1994). The appellant was a complaining witness with respect to the same investigative records that were at issue in <em>Mayor of Baltimore v.

The Court left open the question of whether a complaining victim or witness may be a \"person in interest,\u201d see <em>id. </em>at 90, 617 A.2d 1049, which question was decided by this Court in <em>Briscoe, </em>100 Md.App. at 130-31, 640 A.2d 226.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b684-7\">. Whether the allegations of misconduct are \u201csustained\u201d or \"not sustained\u201d is relevant to the balancing of an officer\u2019s privacy interest against the countervailing public interest in favor of disclosure. <em>See Gun Ban II, </em>329 Md. at 95, 617 A.2d 1040 (stating that, where the allegations are not sustained, \"fairness to the investigated officers and the avoidance of needless publicity to the cooperating witnesses ... justify on public interest grounds the custodian\u2019s denial of inspection\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b684-8\">.

As explained <em>supra, </em>the MSP also claimed that the requested documents were exempt from disclosure under the LEOBR.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b693-6\">. Appellant asked the MSP to create an index of the withheld documents. The MSP refused to prepare such index, and without ever identifying any withheld document, the MSP asserted that it had \"sufficiently described the contents of the records to justify denial of access to the records without the need for a Vaughn index at all.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b694-6\">. In <em>Md. Dep\u2019t of State Police v. Md. State Conference of NAACP Branches, </em>the Court of Appeals emphasized that SG \u00a7 10 \u2014 614(b)(3)(iii) \"authorizes redactions so that the appellant can receive portions of an exempt record which are severable and the <em>receipt of which does not violate the substance of the exemption.\u201d </em>430 Md. 179, 195, 59 A.3d 1037 (2013) <em>(\u2018\u2018NAACP Branches </em>\") (emphasis added). Redactions of all identifying information regarding the troopers and complainants in <em>NAACP Branches </em>were found sufficient not only to remove the documents from the definition of \"personnel records,\u201d but also satisfied the troopers' primary interest that underlies the exemption for personnel records. <em>Id. </em>at 195, 59 A.3d 1037; <em>see also Md. Dep\u2019t of State Police v. Md. State Conference of NAACP Branches, </em>190 Md.App. 359, 393, 988 A.2d 1075 (2010) (Kehoe, J., concurring) (stating that the \"redaction of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"673\">*673</page-number>identifying information would protect the privacy interests of the troopers\u201d and was \"tantamount to a determination that the identifying information was 'reasonably severable\u2019 from the rest of the records)\u201d. Moreover, unlike <em>Gun Ban II </em>and <em>Shropshire, </em>420 Md. 362, 23 A.3d 205 (2011), the instant case involves a finding of a \"sustained\u201d complaint against a police officer. Consequently, concerns about the privacy interests of the police officer weigh much less against the public\u2019s interest in disclosure of information concerning confirmed allegations of racist comments by a police officer in the course of his official duties.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
