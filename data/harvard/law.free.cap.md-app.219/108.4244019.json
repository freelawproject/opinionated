PCEA and the County are parties to a negotiated collective bargaining agreement (\u201cCBA\u201d) concerning the wages, hours, and other terms and conditions of employment for civilian employees of the Prince George\u2019s County Police Department (\u201cDepartment\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b134-8\">On December 27, 2012, the arbitrator issued an Opinion and Award sustaining a grievance filed by PCEA challenging the County\u2019s decision to terminate the employment of Marlon Ford, a civilian employee of the Department whose terms and conditions of employment are covered by the CBA. On the bases of the extensive record adduced during three days of \u201cdetailed testimony\u201d from a \u201cdozen witnesses,\u201d resulting in a transcript of nearly 1,000 pages, the arbitrator found that the factual record did not support the County\u2019s claim that it had \u201cjust cause\u201d to terminate Ford\u2019s employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-9\">The County challenged the arbitrator\u2019s Order and Award in the circuit court, asserting that the Order and Award should be vacated because the County had met its burden of establishing that this case is within the narrow category of cases in which Maryland Courts may vacate an arbitration award. Specifically, the County claimed that the arbitrator (i) exceeded his authority by independently assessing facts and exercising his own judgment in concluding that the Department lacked \u201cjust cause\u201d to terminate Ford\u2019s employment; and (ii) issued an award that is contrary to clear public policy insofar as he found that Ford was entitled to be informed of his right <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>to have a union representative present during an investigatory interview, when his employer was conducting a criminal investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-4\">Citing Maryland\u2019s well-settled law that a court will not generally disrupt the fair decision of an arbitrator, the circuit court rejected the County\u2019s arguments. The County then filed this timely appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"AOo\">The County raises the following issues on appeal, which we have reworded for clarity:<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b135-6\">I. Whether the circuit court erred in failing to vacate the award of the arbitrator when the arbitrator made his own judgments and factual assessments regarding whether the employer had \u201cjust cause\u201d to discipline the employee in the context of the CBA?</p>\n<p id=\"b135-7\">II. Whether the circuit court erred in failing to vacate the award of the arbitrator when it found it was not a violation of public policy that a governing body may bargain away or compromise the statutory duties of its public safety agency to investigate criminal conduct?</p>\n<p id=\"b135-8\">We answer the first question in the negative and the second question in the affirmative and thus reverse the arbitrator\u2019s ruling for the reasons explained below.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-9\">FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b135-10\">On May 15, 2011, a detective assigned to the Criminal Investigation Division (\u201cCID\u201d), of the Department reported to her supervisor that her firearm was missing and possibly stolen from the ladies\u2019 bathroom at the Department\u2019s headquarters. An expansive search and investigation was immedi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>ately initiated by the officer\u2019s fellow CID detectives to search for and retrieve the missing firearm. In the course of conducting the investigation of the missing firearm, Ford, his friend, Khari Grooms, who was in a volunteer position with the Department for individuals with a strong interest in joining the Department, as well as other civilian employees who were in headquarters at or about the time that the officer\u2019s firearm went missing, were all asked to return to headquarters to be questioned by CID detectives. During the investigation of Ford and Grooms for the missing firearm, they submitted to a voice stress analysis (\u201cVSA\u201d) examination.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The results of the VSA examination indicated deception on the part of Ford and Grooms with regard to taking or finding the officer\u2019s missing firearm.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-4\">May 16, 2011, was an off-day for Ford, but he was called by the Department and asked to report to work. Upon his arrival, Ford\u2019s supervisor told Ford that she needed to speak to him \u201creal quick\u201d and that it would \u201conly take a minute.\u201d Ford was then brought into a room and informed that an officer had misplaced her firearm. Ford was told that, after he provided a statement, he would be on his way. He provided a written statement at about 4:00 p.m.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>Instead of being released, Ford was advised of his <em>Miranda</em><footnotemark><em>3</em></footnotemark><em> </em>rights via the Advise of Rights and Waiver Form by Sergeant Tamer of the sexual assault unit and elected to waive his <em>Miranda </em>rights and provide a verbal statement. Ford was then interrogated for fourteen hours by twelve to fourteen detectives from the homicide, sexual assault, robbery, and child abuse units.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-4\">During this part of the investigation, the detectives \u201cscreamed\u201d and cursed at Ford, took his cell phone away, and told him that \u201cno one\u2019s going anywhere until the gun is found.\u201d Ford was told that he was \u201cunder arrest,\u201d and that he would be spending his birthday in jail. Ford was allowed one meal during the fourteen-hour ordeal, which he was allowed to eat at approximately 4:00 a.m. Ford allowed the Department to search his car and to search a room in his home but asked that he be allowed to alert his sickly grandmother before they searched his home so that she would not be startled when the police arrived. Ford was never given the opportunity to alert his grandmother and both his house and his car were \u201ctorn apart\u201d and left in an \u201catrocious\u201d condition. At no point before or during this interrogation was Ford advised that he had a right to union representation pursuant to Article 8 \u00a7 C of the CBA between PCEA and the County.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b137-5\">Ford was never connected to the missing firearm. However, during Grooms\u2019s interview, Grooms stated that on several <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>occasions, he was invited to accompany Ford as he drove around in marked and unmarked police vehicles, \u201cpulled traffic stops,\u201d and responded to \u201ccalls for service.\u201d Grooms also disclosed that he witnessed Ford using the radio as well as activating the emergency equipment such as LED lights and the air horn. Grooms told the CID detectives that Ford represented, on several occasions, that he was a police officer of the Department, and Grooms referred to Ford as \u201cOfficer Ford\u201d during the interrogation because he believed that Ford was a member of the Department. Ford, to the contrary, denied ever driving a marked vehicle. Ford did admit, however, that he had activated emergency equipment on one occasion when he used the air horn to attract the attention of a driver who was driving toward him in a reckless fashion. Ford also admitted to unauthorized use of the radio while operating one of the unmarked police vehicles.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-4\">On May 17, 2011, following the CID detectives\u2019 interrogation of Ford and Grooms, a referral was made to the Internal Affairs Division (\u201cIAD\u201d) to initiate an internal investigation with regard to allegations of Ford\u2019s misconduct. Ford was at that time notified in writing that he was being placed on administrative leave pending the internal affairs investigation by the IAD investigator pursuant to the relevant provisions of the CBA. On July 26, 2011, Ford was notified in writing of his Weingarten<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> rights by the IAD investigator.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>On July 26, 2011, the LAD investigator produced a report of his investigation disclosing his findings and recommendations. The report recommended thirteen charges against Ford. The IAD commanding officer forwarded the report of the investigation to the Office of the Chief of Police with a recommendation that nine of the thirteen charges be sustained and Ford\u2019s employment with the Police Department be terminated. On August 12, 2011, the Chief issued a Notice of Intent of a Proposed Disciplinary Action against Ford for the nine charges sustained against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-4\">On or about August 26, 2011, PCEA submitted a Response to the Notice of Intent to Terminate Ford to the Chief. On August 26, 2011, the Chief issued his Notice of Final Disciplinary Action Terminating Ford effective August 29, 2011. On September 12, 2011, the Union timely issued a grievance letter stating that the disciplinary action against Ford was in violation of Article 8 of the CBA between PCEA and the County. Among the mutually agreed upon terms and conditions of employment enumerated in the CBA, Article 8 broadly outlines the situations in which the Department may discipline an employee and, in some detail, describes the disciplinary procedures that must be followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-5\">By its express terms, Article 8 of the CBA directly addresses discipline for administrative wrongdoing and conduct that constitute a \u201ccriminal violation[ ]\u201d or is \u201crelated to an active criminal investigation.\u201d For example, Article 8 \u00a7 I states that the County will not initiate disciplinary action against an employee later than ninety days after the County becomes aware of the alleged infraction, but that this ninety day rule shall not apply where the alleged infractions are either \u201ccriminal violations\u201d or are \u201crelated to an active criminal investigation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b139-6\">PCEA and the Department began a series of verbal negotiations to determine whether the Chief would be willing to reconsider Ford\u2019s termination. On February 8, 2012, a representative from the Office of the Chief communicated to PCEA that the Chief would not modify Ford\u2019s termination.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>Article 9 of the CBA sets forth the procedures for filing a grievance \u201cconcerning the application or interpretation of the terms\u201d of the CBA \u201cor a claimed violation, misinterpretation or misapplication of the rules or regulations of the Employer affecting the terms and conditions of employment.\u201d The contract describes a multi-step grievance procedure, the last step of which is for the parties to submit the matter to an arbitrator, who is authorized to \u201chear and decide any grievance dispute.\u201d With respect to any grievance submitted to an arbitrator, the parties have agreed that \u201c[t]he rules of the American Arbitration Association shall govern the conduct of the arbitration hearing,\u201d and that the \u201cdecision of the [arbitrator shall be final and binding on both parties.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b140-4\">On February 16, 2012, PCEA, on Ford\u2019s behalf, invoked its right to pursue a grievance through arbitration. On May 14, 2012, July 31, 2012, and August 1, 2012, both the County and PCEA presented evidence, testimony, and arguments on the merits of the union\u2019s grievance before an arbitrator. On December 27, 2012, the arbitrator issued an Opinion and Award sustaining PCEA\u2019s grievance and vacating the discipline imposed on Ford, with the exception of a 30-day suspension, finding that the termination of Ford\u2019s employment \u201ccannot be supported\u201d on the record adduced at the hearing. The Opinion and Award focused on the County\u2019s failure to prove its case, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b140-5\">Almost every aspect of this case raises unanswered questions or is attended by sharply conflicting testimony.... Little purpose would be served by sifting through the many conflicts in the testimony and the written exhibits, most of which would be irreconcilable.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b140-6\">The arbitrator also found that the County violated Article 8 \u00a7 C insofar as it failed to inform Ford that he was entitled to union representation during the May 16, 2011 interrogation. Nevertheless, the arbitrator found that Ford\u2019s conduct was evidence of \u201cbad judgment\u201d and \u201cdeserving of discipline.\u201d Weighing all of these factors, the arbitrator\u2019s Order and Award sustained PCEA\u2019s grievance and ordered a \u201cma[k]e whole\u201d remedy, with the exception of a 30-day suspension.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>On January 28, 2013, the County field a Petition to Vacate the Award in the circuit court. On July 11, 2013, the circuit court heard oral argument on the County\u2019s Petition to Vacate as well as on a Motion to Confirm the Award filed by PCEA. The circuit court subsequently issued a Memorandum and Order in which it denied the Petition to Vacate and granted PCEA\u2019s Petition to Confirm the Award. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-4\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b141-5\">A circuit court\u2019s decision to grant or deny a petition to vacate or confirm an arbitration award is akin to an order granting or denying a motion for summary judgment. <em>See Balt.

A court may set aside the judgment of an arbitrator when the party challenging the award is able to demonstrate that the proceedings were tainted by fraud, misconduct, bias, prejudice, corruption, or lack of good faith on the part of the arbitrator. <em>Bd. of Educ. of Prince George\u2019s Cnty., </em>309 Md. at 100, 522 A.2d 931 (citations omitted). A court may vacate an award if an arbitrator has made a mistake \u201cso gross as to evidence of misconduct or fraud on his part,\u201d <em>id,, </em>or has \u201cexceeded his authority.\u201d <em>Bel Pre Med. Ctr., Inc. v. Frederick Contractors, Inc., </em>21 Md.App. 307, 316, 320 A.2d 558 (1974).

Mass Transit Admin., </em>305 Md. 380, 389 n. 5, 504 A.2d 1132 (1986)).</p>\n<p id=\"b143-7\">I. ARBITRATOR\u2019S AUTHORITY</p>\n<p id=\"b143-8\">The County contends that the arbitrator exceeded his authority when he overturned the Police Chiefs determination that there was just cause to terminate Ford. The County avers that the role and authority of an arbitrator is derived directly from the provisions of the contract between the parties, and the relevant portions of the CBA do not provide the arbitrator with the \u201cliberty to act as a super personnel officer\u201d or substitute the factual findings of the employer who conducted the initial investigation of the employee\u2019s misconduct. The County further contends that absent specific language as to the standard of review to be applied by an arbitrator during a just cause termination grievance, the arbitrator must apply an \u201cobjective reasonable standard\u201d to the evidence to determine whether the employer had just cause to discipline or terminate the employee.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>PCEA responds that the circuit court correctly found that the arbitrator did not exceed his authority by evaluating the facts to determine whether the County had just cause to terminate Ford\u2019s employment. PCEA contends that the plain language of the CBA gave the arbitrator authority to \u201chear,\u201d \u201cdecide,\u201d and issue a \u201cfinal and binding\u201d determination on whether the County had \u201cjust cause\u201d to terminate Ford\u2019s employment. PCEA also avers that courts have universally interpreted language similar to the CBA to give arbitrators <em>de novo </em>authority to review \u201cjust cause\u201d disciplinary determinations.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-4\">The CBA between the County and the PCEA affords the PCEA the right to bring a grievance \u201cconcerning the application or interpretation of the terms of th[e] Agreement or a claimed violation, misinterpretation or misapplication of the rules or regulations of the Employer affecting the terms and conditions of employment.\u201d CBA Art. 9 \u00a7 9.1. The CBA sets out a multi-step grievance procedure. CBA Art. 9. Within ten days after the event giving rise of the grievance, the employee\u2019s PCEA delegate may discuss the grievance with the Division Head and the Division Head will attempt to adjust the matter and respond orally to the employee within two days. CBA Art. 9 \u00a7 9.1. If the grievance is not settled through the discussions in Step 1 of the grievance process, a written grievance may be filed, including the specific relief sought, and presented to the Chief of Police. CBA Art. 9 \u00a7 9.2. Upon receipt of a written grievance, a meeting will be held within ten days where the Chief of Police meets with the employee, the PCEA President and the employee\u2019s PCEA delegate to render a decision in writing no later than ten days after the meeting. <em>Id. </em>If the grievance is not settled in Step 2, the grievance may be moved to a written appeal, signed by the aggrieved employee and the PCEA President or the employee\u2019s PCEA delegate. <em>Id. </em>The final step is to submit the dispute to an arbitrator who is \u201cappointed to hear and decide [the] grievance\u201d and whose decision \u201cshall be final and binding on both parties.\u201d CBA Art. 9 \u00a7\u00a7 9.3(A)(4), 9.3(B). Thus, as it relates to the County\u2019s application of the \u201cjust cause\u201d standard <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>contained in Article 8 \u00a7 A, the role of the arbitrator is to \u201chear\u201d and make a \u201cfinal and binding\u201d decision as to whether the employer had \u201cjust cause\u201d to discipline an employee.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-4\">The County asserts that the arbitrator\u2019s role in hearing a grievance over a \u201cjust cause\u201d termination is far more limited. Under the County\u2019s theory, the arbitrator\u2019s role is \u201cquasi-appellate,\u201d or limited to determining whether the County had an \u201cobjectively] reasonable\u201d basis for making such a decision, without evaluating the facts of the dispute from his \u201csubjective point of view.\u201d We agree with the PCEA that this theory is inconsistent with the CBA. Again, Article 9 of the CBA provides that when the parties have a \u201cdispute concerning the application or interpretation of terms\u201d of the contract, an arbitrator may be appointed to \u201chear and decide\u201d the dispute and render an \u201cfinal and binding\u201d decision. A clear reading of this language is that the parties have agreed that the arbitrator had the authority to act in the manner that he did.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-5\">The County argues that the \u201cessence\u201d of the relevant provisions can only be interpreted to give the arbitrator the authority to determine whether the County\u2019s determination was \u201cobjectively reasonable.\u201d The County does not explain what it means by an \u201cobjectively reasonable\u201d standard \u2014 whether it means that an arbitrator should affirm the County\u2019s discipline determination if the decision was based on substantial evidence or was not arbitrary and capricious or was not clearly erroneous, or some other standard altogether. The County also fails to cite precedent or support for its position that there is an \u201cobjectively reasonable\u201d standard or that the arbitrator should defer in anyway to the County\u2019s factual findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-6\">Of course, the parties could have agreed that an arbitrator\u2019s role is to serve some other function. For example, \u201c[i]f the employer wanted the automatic right to discharge an employee for violation of certain company rules or for the commission of certain crimes, ... it had the opportunity to seek such an explicit exclusion from the general arbitration clause when the collective agreement was negotiated, as it may do when the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>collective agreement expires.\u201d <em>Amalgamated Transit Union, </em>305 Md. at 388, 504 A.2d 1132 (quoting <em>Local 453, Int\u2019l Union of Elec., Radio &amp; Machine Workers v. Otis Elevator Co., </em>314 F.2d 25, 28 (2d Cir.1963)). In the present case, however, the parties agreed that the role of the arbitrator was to make a \u201cfinal and binding\u201d decision based on the \u201capplication or interpretation\u201d of the \u201cjust cause\u201d language of the CBA.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-4\">Further, not only did the parties agree to give the arbitrator \u201cfinal and binding authority,\u201d but they also affirmatively adopted the rules of the American Arbitration Association to \u201cgovern the conduct of the arbitration hearing.\u201d CBA Art. 9 \u00a7 9.3(A)(4). Those rules gave the arbitrator the authority to determine the admissibility, the relevance, and materiality of the evidence offered and to exclude evidence deemed by the arbitrator to be cumulative or irrelevant.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b146-5\">Courts have consistently interpreted similar language to give arbitrators <em>de novo </em>authority to review \u201cjust cause\u201d disciplinary determinations. The County has not identified a single case in Maryland, or anywhere else, which holds or indicates that the role of a arbitrator in hearing and deciding a grievance is to ask whether the employer\u2019s decision was \u201cobjectively reasonable\u201d and to defer to the employer\u2019s own factual determination. On the contrary, both the Court of Appeals of Maryland and the United States Supreme Court have consistently found that the role of an arbitrator is to make factual determinations based on evidence presented. For example, in <em>Amalgamated Transit Union, </em>305 Md. at 381-84, 504 A.2d 1132, the Court of Appeals reviewed a challenge to an arbitrator\u2019s determination that the MTA terminated an employee\u2019s employment without just cause to do so. 305 Md. at 381-84, 504 A.2d 1132. As is the case here, the parties had a previous agreement establishing that the decision of the arbitrator would be \u201cfinal and binding.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 384, 504 A.2d 1132. In holding that the arbitrator had the authority to fashion a less severe remedy than the discipline <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>imposed by the MTA, the Court of Appeals explained that an arbitrator has \u201cbroad discretion\u201d to fashion an award that is \u201cappropriate to the facts as found by the arbitrator.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 390, 504 A.2d 1132 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b147-4\">The Court of Appeals\u2019s holding in <em>Amalgamated Transit Union </em>adopted the reasoning of the Second Circuit in <em>Local 453, supra, </em>314 F.2d 25, which explained the rationale for courts to afford deference to an arbitrator\u2019s award. In <em>Local 453, </em>the Second Circuit made clear that because the parties \u201cbargained for the decision of the arbitrator\u201d on whether the employee\u2019s conduct \u201cconstituted \u2018just cause\u2019 for the discharge, the parties are bound by it, even if it be regarded as unwise or wrong on the merits.\u201d <em>Local 453, </em>314 F.2d at 28. The basic principle that courts should uphold an arbitrator\u2019s opinion has been reaffirmed by Maryland Courts repeatedly. <em>See, e.g., Balt. Cnty., </em>329 Md. at 701, 621 A.2d 864 (\u201cat common law, courts generally deferred to the arbitrator\u2019s findings of fact and applications of law\u201d); <em>Bd. of Educ. of Prince George\u2019s Cnty., </em>309 Md. at 100, 522 A.2d 931 (generally, \u201carbitration awards will not be vacated for errors of ... fact.\u201d); <em>Balt. Teachers Union, </em>108 Md.App. at 181, 671 A.2d 80 (referencing the role of the arbitrator in making \u201cfindings of fact\u201d); <em>Int\u2019l Ass\u2019n of Firefighters, Local 1619 v. Prince George\u2019s County, </em>74 Md.App. 438, 446-47, 538 A.2d 329 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b147-5\">Citing <em>United Paperworkers Int\u2019l Union, AFL-CIO v. Mis-co, Inc., </em>484 U.S. 29, 108 S.Ct. 364, 98 L.Ed.2d 286 (1987) and <em>Towson Univ. v. Conte, </em>384 Md. 68, 862 A.2d 941 (2004), the County asserts that its proposed \u201cobjectively reasonable\u201d standard is consistent with Federal and Maryland case law. In <em>Misco, </em>the United States District Court for the Western District of Louisiana vacated the arbitrator\u2019s award on grounds that the arbitrator\u2019s award was contrary to public policy, and the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit affirmed. 484 U.S. at 34-35, 108 S.Ct. 364. The United States Supreme Court, however, reversed, noting that in response to the employer\u2019s alternative argument that the arbitrator made \u201cerroneous findings\u201d of fact, \u201cit is the arbitrator\u2019s view of the facts and meaning of the contract\u201d that the parties have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>agreed to accept, and that \u201cimprovident, even silly, factfinding ... is hardly a sufficient basis\u201d for a court to disregard the decision of an arbitrator \u201cappointed by the parties.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 36-39, 108 S.Ct. 364; <em>see also id. </em>at 38, 108 S.Ct. 364 (\u201cTo resolve disputes about the application of a collective bargaining agreement, an arbitrator must find facts and a court may not reject those findings simply because it disagrees with them.\u201d). At no point does <em>Misco </em>discuss, apply, or define an \u201cobjectively reasonable\u201d standard of review. In fact, <em>Misco </em>affirms the arbitrator\u2019s role as a fact-finder and reinforces the deference courts should grant an arbitrator\u2019s decisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-4\">The County\u2019s reliance on <em>Towson Univ. </em>is also misplaced. In that case, Conte, the Director of Regional Economic Studies Institute for Towson University, sued the University for wrongful discharge and breach of contract requesting a jury trial. <em>Towson Univ., </em>384 Md. at 74, 862 A.2d 941. At issue were the terms and conditions of employment \u2014 including the \u201cjust cause\u201d discipline provision \u2014 which were set by an individual employment agreement that did not afford the employee the right to bring the disputes to an arbitrator authorized to make a \u201cfinal and binding\u201d determination. <em>Id. </em>at 74-75, 862 A.2d 941. Indeed, although the employment agreement provided Conte with the right to an internal review of the decision, the agreement gave the employer complete \u201cfact-finding prerogative.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 82, 862 A.2d 941. Therefore, the question presented to the Court of Appeals was \u201cto what extent a <em>jury </em>may examine or review the factual bases of an employer\u2019s decision to terminate an employee in the absence of an express directive from the employment contract.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 71-72, 862 A.2d 941 (emphasis added). On those facts and based on those circumstances, the Court of Appeals held that the role of a jury in reviewing an employment contract that provides for \u201cjust cause\u201d termination is not \u201cto scrutinize the factual bases for the decision to terminate.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 85, 862 A.2d 941. Unlike in <em>Conte, </em>where the parties mutually agreed that the employer would have the fact-finding prerogative, the case before us does not involve the role of a jury in reviewing an employer\u2019s decision; it involves an arbitrator\u2019s Order and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>Award based on an arbitration hearing. Thus, we affirm the circuit court\u2019s decision to rely on the wording of the CBA and our precedent, to hold that the arbitrator in the present case did not exceed his authority, and that the arbitrator in the present case applied the correct standard of review.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-4\">II. PUBLIC POLICY</p>\n<p id=\"b149-5\">The County contends that the circuit court\u2019s decision that officers in the Department are obligated to inform union members of their <em>Weingarten </em>rights while conducting a criminal investigation violates public policy. The County avers that the circuit court\u2019s expansion of <em>Weingarten </em>interferes with a public agency\u2019s statutory duties to detect and investigate criminal conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-6\">PCEA responds that the circuit court correctly declined to vacate the arbitrator\u2019s Order and Award because it did not constitute a violation of public policy. PCEA contends that there is no well established public policy in Maryland that is contradicted by the arbitrator\u2019s Order and Award. PCEA further avers that not only is the Order and Award not contradictory to an established public policy, but it also does not provide any new rights to employees covered by the CBA. Finally, the PCEA contends that the County offers no justification for its claim that the CBA interferes with the Department\u2019s duties to effectively investigate criminal conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-7\"><em>Weingarten </em>rights stem from the United States Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>NLRB v. J. Weingarten, Inc., </em>420 U.S. 251, 95 S.Ct. 959, 43 L.Ed.2d 171 (1975), which states that employees must be provided certain procedural protections and the right to have union representation present when they are subject to an investigation or questions that may result in discipline. The <em>Weingarten </em>right allows an employee to request the presence of a a union representative, or in some instances a co-worker, at an employer\u2019s investigatory interview when the employee reasonably believes that the interview might lead to disciplinary action.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 267, 95 S.Ct. 959.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>A court will not enforce a labor arbitration award if that award is contrary to public policy. <em>Bd. of Educ. of Prince George\u2019s Cnty., </em>309 Md. at 100, 522 A.2d 931. However, \u201cthe public policy which obliges a court to refrain from enforcing a collective bargaining agreement must be \u2018explicit.\u2019 \u201d <em>Amalgamated Transit Union, </em>305 Md. at 389, 504 A.2d 1132 (quoting <em>W.R. Grace &amp; Co. v. Local Union 759, </em>461 U.S. 757, 766, 103 S.Ct. 2177, 76 L.Ed.2d 298 (1983)). The public policy \u201cmust be well defined and dominant, and is to be ascertained by reference to the laws and legal precedents and not from general considerations of public interests.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b150-4\">In this case, the arbitrator found that the detectives who questioned Ford about his use of Departmental vehicles and his alleged impersonating of a police officer violated Article 8 \u00a7 C of the CBA because they did not first provide Ford notice of his rights under that contract provision. In particular, Article 8 \u00a7 C requires that an employee subject to an investigatory interview that may result in discipline first be informed of his right to have a union representative present during questioning:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b150-5\">When an employee ... is to be the subject of an investigatory interview or other meeting which may result in discipline, he/she shall be informed in writing at least five (5) working <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>days prior to the start of the interview ... This time period may be extended by mutual consent of the Employer and the employee. However, if an immediate interview is required and the designated PCEA representative is unavailable, the employee may select another PCEA representative who can be present during the investigatory interview.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b151-4\">The arbitrator concluded, in what he considered to be a straightforward application of this section, that the County detectives failed to notify Ford about his right to union representation, and that this contract violation was not excused, even though it was in the course of a criminal interrogation of Ford about the missing handgun.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-5\">The County contends that the arbitrator\u2019s application of Article 8 \u00a7 C violates public policy by setting a precedent that constitutes an \u201cexpanded interpretation\u201d of the CBA and interferes with public safety\u2019s statutory duties to detect and investigate criminal conduct. The County contends that this is an issue of first impression in Maryland and relies on two out-of-state cases from New York, <em>City of New York v. Uniformed Fire Officers Ass\u2019n, Local 854, IAFF, AFL-CIO, </em>263 A.D.2d 3, 699 N.Y.S.2d 355 (1999), and Illinois, <em>Ill. State Police v. Fraternal Order of Police Troopers Lodge No. 41, </em>323 Ill.App.3d 322, 256 Ill.Dec. 424, 751 N.E.2d 1261 (2001). The dictates of these cases were rejected by the arbitrator and the circuit court because in both cases, the criminal investigation and the termination of employment involved the same behavior by the employee in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-6\">We disagree with the circuit court and the arbitrator that the reasoning and rationale of these cases are not applicable to the present case where the subject of the investigation continued to be a criminal act \u2014 impersonating an officer \u2014 and thus, the County\u2019s desire for an expeditious investigation of the criminal matter was still at issue. As in the New York and Illinois cases, cited by the County, we agree that expanding the requirement of <em>Weingarten </em>rights to union employees that are the focus of a criminal investigation violates public <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>policy. In <em>Illinois State Police, </em>the Illinois Court encountered very similar facts to the matter before this Court. The union in the <em>Illinois State Police </em>ease submitted several grievances to an arbitrator alleging that the State Police violated the <em>Weingarten </em>provisions of the collective bargaining agreement when employees of the police department were subjected to criminal investigation and interrogation by officers of the department\u2019s internal investigation division without adhering to the <em>Weingarten </em>provisions of the collective bargaining agreement. <em>Illinois State Police, </em>256 Ill.Dec. 424, 751 N.E.2d at 1262-64 (2001). The arbitrator issued an opinion sustaining the grievances and ordering the State Police department to abide by the provisions of the collective bargaining agreement and to provide the union members who were subject to criminal investigations with their <em>Miranda </em>rights and their <em>Weingarten </em>rights. <em>Id., 256 </em>Ill.Dec. 424, 751 N.E.2d at 1264. The State Police department filed a motion to vacate the arbitration award before the trial court. <em>Id. </em>The trial court denied the motion and affirmed the arbitrator\u2019s decision. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b152-4\">The Illinois State Police Department appealed that decision to the intermediate Appellate Court for Illinois, Fourth District and argued that the arbitrator, <em>inter alia, </em>(1) exceeded his authority in ruling that union members could not be interrogated regarding criminal matters unless they were provided with their <em>Weingarten </em>rights, (2) ignored the plain language of the contract, and (3) the arbitration award violates public policy. <em>Id., 256 </em>Ill.Dec. 424, 751 N.E.2d at 1265-66. The Appellate Court held that the trial court erred in affirming the arbitration award holding:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b152-5\">[A]n employer cannot by contract give its employees procedural rights and benefits regarding criminal investigations. The fact that the employer in this case is the Illinois State Police is immaterial. Clearly, when plaintiff is investigating an employees criminal conduct, it is acting under its statutory duty to enforce the laws of the State of Illinois, not as an employer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b152-6\">Accordingly, we find that the arbitrator exceeded his authority and thus the trial court erred....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b153-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number><em>Id., </em>256 Ill.Dec. 424, 751 N.E.2d at 1266 (internal citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b153-4\">The Illinois Appellate Court also found that the arbitrator\u2019s award requiring compliance with the <em>Weingarten </em>provisions of the collective bargaining agreement while the police department conducted criminal investigations violated the public policy of effective law enforcement. <em>Id., </em>256 Ill.Dec. 424, 751 N.E.2d at 1267. The Illinois Court declared that the public policy of effective law enforcement is demonstrated by the laws of the state. <em>Id., </em>256 Ill.Dec. 424, 751 N.E.2d at 1266. Furthermore, the Illinois Court determined that requiring compliance with the <em>Weingarten </em>provisions of the collective bargaining agreement during a criminal investigation interfered with the police department\u2019s ability to investigate crimes. <em>Id., </em>256 Ill.Dec. 424, 751 N.E.2d at 1267. The Illinois Court also noted that if it required the police to administer <em>Weingarten </em>provisions while conducting a criminal investigation, their effectiveness and ability to investigate crimes involving union members would be frustrated. <em>Id. </em>Thus, the Illinois Court not only concluded that the arbitrator exceeded his authority, but also concluded that requiring compliance with the <em>Weingarten </em>provisions during a criminal investigation violated the public police of effective law enforcement. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b153-5\">Similarly, in <em>City of New York, </em>699 N.Y.S.2d at 360, the Supreme Court of New York, Appellate Division, also determined that <em>Weingarten </em>provisions of the collective bargaining agreement do not apply when the employer is conducting a criminal investigation of union members. In <em>City of New York, </em>the union brought a grievance and made a demand for arbitration alleging that interviews of its members by the City\u2019s Department of Investigations were conducted in violation of the <em>Weingarten </em>provisions of the collective bargaining agreement. <em>Id. </em>at 356. The City argued that the matter was not arbitrable. <em>Id. </em>at 357. The City further argued that in conducting criminal investigations, \u201cthe collective bargaining agreement cannot, as a matter of public policy, supplant or impair those procedures; and that public policy considerations prohibit negotiations of the [agency\u2019s] criminal investigation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>procedures.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The trial court agreed with the City and held that \u201censuring governmental integrity is a public policy sufficiently strong as to preclude referral of this dispute to arbitration.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The Court of Appeals affirmed the ruling of the circuit court and stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b154-4\">The concomitant discretion conferred upon the Department to carry out its mandate would likewise be impermissibly compromised by the restrictions imposed upon its examination of witnesses by the collective bargaining agreement between respondent Uniformed Fire Officers Association and the New York City Fire Department. Because the prerogative of the Department to employ such investigative procedures as it deems appropriate may not be bargained away, there is no reason to submit to arbitration the question of whether the employee rights provisions of the union\u2019s collective bargaining agreement are binding upon the [Department of Investigations].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b154-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 360.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-6\">As in <em>Illinois State Police </em>and <em>City of New York, </em>the arbitrator\u2019s award here and the circuit court\u2019s decision to uphold the arbitrator\u2019s award constrains the ability of the County\u2019s police department to conduct criminal investigations and interrogations of their union members. The arbitrator found that these cases did not apply because \u201c[h]ere, the original investigation (the missing gun) was wholly unrelated to what quickly became the focus of the CID interrogation and the IAD investigation that followed.\u201d However, the investigation that followed, while not related to the missing gun, still related to the criminal offense of impersonating an officer.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The record indicates that the interrogation shifted from the missing gun to \u201cwhether [Ford] had on multiple occasions impersonated a police officer and had driven pool vehicles as if <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>he were an officer on duty, even pulling over speeding cars, using his vehicles horn.\u201d While the arbitrator discussed how this indicated that the conversation has shifted from criminal behavior to Ford\u2019s behavior as an employee \u201cwho, from time to time, drove, refueled and maintained police vehicles,\u201d the arbitrator failed to acknowledge that Ford\u2019s alleged actions implicated criminal behavior in the context of impersonating a police officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-4\">The PCEA contends that Article 8 \u00a7 C was definitely interpreted in a 2004 arbitration, <em>In re: Prince George\u2019s County and Prince George\u2019s County Police Civilian Employee\u2019s Association </em>(Smith, 2004) (herein <em>\u201cLanier </em>\u201d), and thus, the County knew that interrogating an employee about a criminal matter would require <em>Weingarten </em>rights. In <em>Lanier, </em>the Department interrogated an employee, Lanier, a public safety aide, regarding her criminal interference with a police investigation, without affording Lanier the rights guaranteed to her by Article 8 \u00a7 C. The Department subsequently terminated her employment and PCEA filed a grievance in which it alleged, among other things, that the Department had violated Article 8 \u00a7 C when it interviewed Lanier without affording her a right to union representation.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-5\">The County, in <em>Lanier, </em>denied that it violated Article 8 \u00a7 C because Lanier was interviewed as part of a criminal investigation. However, the arbitrator noted that \u201c[w]hile a criminal investigation was certainly ongoing, the grievant was also interrogated as an employee,\u201d which created additional \u201cpressure [for Lanier] to cooperate.\u201d <em>Lanier, </em>at 16-17. The arbitrator noted that, \u201c[i]f the grievant had simply been a member of the general public, she would not have been directed to go to Lt. Carney\u2019s office, would not have been told to sit on a chair in the hall and stay there, and would not have been directed to stay after her shift ended and continue sitting in a chair.\u201d The arbitrator further noted that the Department had conceded that a non-employee citizen in the grievant\u2019s position would have had no obligation to speak with the police in those circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>While the PCEA is correct that the decision in <em>Lanier </em>preceded the current hearing, this alone is not dispositive of the issue. The arbitrator\u2019s reasoning in <em>Lanier </em>is not persuasive. The serious crime of theft of a police officer\u2019s service weapon and impersonating a police officer cannot give way to an employee\u2019s <em>Weingarten </em>rights. To do so, as held by our sister jurisdictions, would interfere with the police department\u2019s ability to investigate crimes and violate the public policy of effective law enforcement. The public safety exception applies to this case because Ford was being interrogated about several crimes by his police department employer rather than merely an employment issue and we thus reverse the decision of the circuit court affirming the arbitrator\u2019s decision.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b156-4\">III. VACATION AND REMAND</p>\n<p id=\"b156-5\">Courts have found that arbitrator awards can be vacated for violating public policy. <em>See Brown v. Rauscher Pierce Refsnes, Inc., </em>796 F.Supp. 496, 500 (M.D.Fla.1992) (stating that federal courts have fashioned other grounds for vacating awards in arbitration cases including when the arbitral award violates notions of public policy); <em>aff'd, </em>994 F.2d 775 (11th Cir.1993); accord <em>Delta Air Lines, Inc. v.

In <em>Downey, </em>the Court of Appeals cited the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, in a commercial arbitration case, which stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b157-4\">Although judicial review of an arbitration award is very narrowly limited, <em>DiapulseCorporation of America v.

The arbitrator did not \u201cbelieve that the grievant ever acted with the intent that would be required to prove that he should be convicted of the crimes enumerated in the charges against him.\u201d Second, the arbitrator found that the personnel procedures for Prince George\u2019s County encourage progressive discipline. Third, the arbitrator found that those procedures also recommend that mitigating factors are to be taken into consideration, such as the grievant\u2019s excellent employment record in the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-5\">The fourth component to the arbitrator\u2019s decision was the <em>Weingarten </em>issue. In the arbitrator\u2019s final decision, he stated that the New York and Illinois cases were distinguishable from this case because, \u201c[i]n both those cases, the criminal investigation and the termination of employment involved the same behavior by the employee in question. Here, the original investigation (the missing gun) was wholly unrelated to what quickly became the focus of the CID interrogation and the IAD investigation that followed.\u201d The arbitrator totally disregarded the criminal nature of the investigation that followed. The arbitrator found that the \u201cfailure to offer a Union representative to the grievant once the inquiry became the grievant\u2019s behavior as an employee who, from time to time, drove, refueled and maintained police vehicles, [was] a <em>significant factor weighing in the grievant\u2019s favor. </em>When combined with the other reasons given above, the arbitrator found that the grievant\u2019s termination of employment could not be supported.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-6\">Although we defer to the arbitrator\u2019s reasoning and findings as to the first three portions of his decision, we part company with him as to the fourth portion. As the arbitrator based his final decision to reduce the termination to a thirty (30) day suspension on all four of the enumerated reasons, we cannot <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>eliminate the final reason without making the entire decision and award contradictory.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-5\">We, therefore, vacate the arbitrator\u2019s decision and award. <em>See Downey, </em>428 Md. at 269, 51 A.3d 573. After rehearing, the decision of the new arbitrator will be the final award, subject to the very limited judicial review applicable to arbitration awards generally. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b159-6\">JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR PRINCE GEORGE\u2019S COUNTY VACATED.

The principle underlying this test is that the human voice has many frequencies or a number of sound waves. In addition to the voice that can be heard, there are a series of low frequency (FM) sound waves which are inaudible to the human ear. When a person is under stress or lying, these FM sound waves tend to disappear, due to physiological changes in the body. Conversely, when a person is not under stress or is telling the truth, these FM sound waves are more pronounced. In other words, the absence of FM sound waves indicates the person is lying; the presence of FM sound waves indicates the person is telling the truth.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b136-7\">In order to conduct this test, the subject is asked certain questions and the answers are recorded on a tape recorder. This tape is reduced in speed and is fed into a psychological stress evaluator, which is similar to an electrocardiogram machine. Based on the reading of the chart from this machine, the examiner determines whether the subject is lying or telling the truth. It has a purported accuracy of 85 percent which is comparable to that of a lie detector.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b137-6\">. \u201cPursuant to <em>Miranda v.
