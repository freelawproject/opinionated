The State charged Cristian with multiple counts, including second-degree assault and resisting and interfering with arrest, after an altercation with a police officer. Cristian moved to dismiss the State\u2019s complaint as untimely, and the court denied the motion. Because an intake officer properly authorized the filing of a delinquency petition, and because the circuit court correctly found that Cristian has not proven that the State\u2019s delay in filing the complaint caused him actual prejudice, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-7\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b81-8\">On October 26, 2012, shortly after Cristian\u2019s seventeenth birthday, his younger brother Ricardo was involved in a fight at a McDonald\u2019s in Silver Spring. Cristian was not implicated in the altercation and was not there when it occurred. Detective Jeffrey Bunge of the Montgomery County Police saw the fighting from the police station across the street. He witnessed Ricardo punching another individual and began to approach the scene.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-9\">The fight broke up as Detective Bunge arrived and the participants fled, including Ricardo. Detective Bunge and Officer Daniel Sassi found Ricardo approximately fifteen minutes later. They pursued him, and Detective Bunge eventually stopped him. Detective Bunge identified himself, drew his gun, and told Ricardo to get on the ground. Ricardo complied and as Detective Bunge began to put him in handcuffs, Cristian arrived at the scene. Cristian had heard that his brother was involved in a fight and had come looking for him. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>Cristian ran toward Detective Bunge and Ricardo yelling, \u201cThat\u2019s my brother, that\u2019s my brother, leave him alone.\u201d Detective Bunge and Corporal Tony Galladora, who had come to assist the other officers, told Cristian to stop, but he continued to approach his brother and Detective Bunge. Corporal Galladora stopped Cristian and brought him to the ground. According to the testimony of Corporal Galladora and Officer Jeffrey Rea, Cristian got back up, assumed a fighting stance, and said, \u201cWhat\u2019s up? What\u2019s up?\u201d Officer Rea, who was standing behind Cristian, subdued him with a Taser and then arrested him.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-5\">The State filed a complaint (the \u201cComplaint\u201d) with the Department of Juvenile Services (\u201cDJS\u201d) on November 15, 2012, twenty days after Cristian\u2019s arrest on October 26.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> A juvenile intake officer (the \u201cIntake Officer\u201d) reviewed the Complaint that day and authorized the filing of a formal delinquency petition (the \u201cPetition\u201d) without conducting an intake interview with Cristian. As luck would have it, Cristian was arrested for first-degree assault on that same day, November 15, 2012, in an unrelated incident (the \u201cassault action\u201d), although these charges were <em>nol prossed </em>on January 11, 2013.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-8\">The Intake Officer determined in the <em>delinquency </em>action that Cristian\u2019s detention in the <em>assault </em>action would likely last beyond the twenty-five-day timeline allotted for an intake officer to make a decision on whether to file a petition. <em>See </em>Md.Code (1974, 2013 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7 3-8A-10(c) of Courts &amp; Judicial Proceedings Article (\u201cCJP\u201d).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Accordingly, the In<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>take Officer authorized the filing of the Petition in keeping with CJP \u00a7 3-8A-10(c) and without conducting an intake interview with Cristian. The State filed the Petition on December 11, 2012, charging Cristian with second-degree assault, disorderly conduct, conspiracy to commit disorderly conduct, resisting and interfering with arrest, attempting to resist and interfere with arrest, and attempting to obstruct and hinder a police officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-5\">Cristian moved to dismiss on February 13, 2013. He argued that the State had violated CJP \u00a7 3-8A-10(m), which requires law enforcement officers to file the initial complaint with DJS within fifteen days of when a juvenile is brought into custody.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The State had filed the Complaint on November 15, 2012, twenty days after Cristian\u2019s arrest on October 26, 2012, and five days late<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> under the statute. Cristian argued that the State\u2019s delay in filing violated \u201cstatutory timeliness\u201d and due process, and \u201ccaused [him] actual prejudice,\u201d since he was not provided the opportunity for an intake interview, which might have convinced the Intake Officer to refrain from authorizing the filing of the Petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>At an adjudication hearing on February 15, 2013, the circuit court denied the motion to dismiss, noting that \u201cit\u2019s just too speculative to think that the case would have been not petitioned and there\u2019s really no showing of any prejudice to the defense. So if it was delayed four days or six days, or whatever, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s sufficient in and of itself to dismiss it.\u201d The circuit court found that Cristian was \u201cinvolved\u201d <footnotemark>6</footnotemark> in attempting to interfere with arrest and attempting to obstruct and hinder a police officer performing his lawful duties. At the disposition hearing on March 7, 2013, the court sustained Cristian\u2019s probation pursuant to the recommendation of DJS. Cristian filed a timely notice of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-4\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b84-5\">Although the parties have focused largely on whether or when Cristian should have been interviewed, our analysis, and the Intake Officer\u2019s ultimate responsibility, revolves around the more fundamental question of whether the officer conducted an appropriate investigation of the juvenile\u2019s case before recommending that a petition be filed. Because we are satisfied with the Intake Officer\u2019s investigation and rationale for deciding not to conduct an intake interview, and because Cristian\u2019s claims of actual prejudice are too attenuated, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-6\">After a juvenile is taken into custody, the State may file a complaint with DJS. The complaint must be filed within fifteen days from the date a juvenile is arrested. <em>See </em>CJP \u00a7 3-8A-10(m). In turn, the intake officer must review the complaint \u201cwithin 25 days as to whether the court has jurisdiction and whether judicial action is in the best interests of the public or the child.\u201d CJP \u00a7 3-8A-10(c)(1). As part of this inquiry, \u201cit is incumbent upon the intake officer to review <em>all of </em>the evidence reasonably available to him or her.... <em>Ordi</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number><em>narily </em>an intake interview is an essential part of the preliminary review unless the juvenile refuses to participate or is unable to participate.\u201d <em>In re Kevin Eugene C., </em>90 Md.App. 85, 92, 599 A.2d 1233 (1992) (second emphasis added). After this investigation, and within the twenty-five-day time period, the intake officer makes a recommendation to the State\u2019s Attorney and may \u201c[a]uthorize the filing of a petition,\u201d \u201c[pjropose an informal adjustment of the matter,\u201d or decide not to authorize a petition at all. CJP \u00a7 3-8A-10(c)(3)(i)-(iii).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Violations of CJP \u00a7 3-8A-10 may result in dismissal of a petition, but <em>\u201conly </em>if the respondent has demonstrated actual prejudice.\u201d CJP \u00a7 3-8A-10(n) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b85-5\">Because Cristian\u2019s claims include a constitutional dimension (he alleges a violation of his due process rights), we review his contentions against \u201cour own independent constitutional analysis.\u201d <em>Glover v. State, </em>368 Md. 211, 220, 792 A.2d 1160 (2002) (citing <em>State v. Bailey, </em>319 Md. 392, 415, 572 A.2d 544 (1990)); <em>see also Butler v. State, </em>214 Md.App. 635, 655, 78 A.3d 887 (2013). \u201cWe perform a <em>de novo </em>constitutional appraisal in light of the particular facts of the case at hand; in so doing, we accept a lower court\u2019s findings of fact unless clearly erroneous.\u201d <em>Glover, </em>368 Md. at 221, 792 A.2d 1160.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-6\">Cristian argues that the State\u2019s failure to file a timely complaint under CJP \u00a7 3-8A10(m) caused him actual prejudice.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> He contends that had the State filed the Complaint <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>within the statute\u2019s timeframe, he could have participated in an intake interview and this interview might have convinced the Intake Officer not to authorize the filing of the Petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-5\">The Intake Officer reviewed the belatedly-submitted Complaint and decided to authorize the filing of the Petition without interviewing Cristian. The Intake Officer anticipated that Cristian couldn\u2019t participate in an interview, especially given the twenty-five-day timeframe allotted for a decision on whether or not to file a petition, because of Cristian\u2019s arrest, which the officer believed would result in a detention. <em>See </em>CJP \u00a7 3-8A-10(c)(3); <em>see also Kevin Eugene C., </em>90 Md.App. at 91-92, 599 A.2d 1233. Put differently, the Intake Officer assumed Cristian would be unavailable for an interview since he had been arrested.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-6\">Cristian contends that he <em>was </em>in fact available for an intake interview up until his arrest on November 15, 2012.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> He claims he was prejudiced by the delay in filing the Complaint, which deprived him of an interview, because there was \u201cat least a reasonable possibility that a delinquency petition would not have been filed had an intake hearing been conducted.\u201d Cristian claims that in an intake interview, \u201che would have [had] the opportunity to persuade the [Intake Officer] to pursue an informal adjustment or deny authorization for the filing of a petition.\u201d He points to several mitigating factors that he would have discussed during the intake interview, including his abusive upbringing and his attempts to protect his younger brother, and that he contends may have convinced <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>the Intake Officer not to file a petition. Cristian admits, however, that \u201cthere is no guarantee that the [Intake Officer] would have taken a different course had there been an opportunity for an intake hearing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b87-4\">Picking up on this concession, the State claims that Cristian has \u201cfailed to establish actual prejudice.\u201d The State contends that Cristian was at fault for his inability to participate in an intake hearing, given the pending assault action, and that the Intake Officer already \u201cwas aware of all the circumstances surrounding [Cristian\u2019s] alleged involvement in the alleged delinquent act, including his upbringing, his family situation, his history in the juvenile system, and his new felony assault charges.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b87-5\">We conclude that the Intake Officer in this case met his responsibility to review Cristian\u2019s case, even though he did not conduct an interview, and we agree with the State that Cristian has failed to establish actual prejudice. <em>First, </em>an intake officer\u2019s responsibility is to \u201creview fully the case so as to determine whether it would be more appropriately handled through informal adjustment or even to recommend that no further action be taken.\u201d <em>In re Steven B., </em>84 Md.App. 1, 8, 578 A.2d 223 (1990). An intake interview may be a part of this review process, but the core requirement is that the officer conduct a thorough <em>investigation </em>of the juvenile\u2019s case.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-6\">The determination of whether dismissal of a petition is warranted in the absence of an intake interview depends on whether \u201cunder the circumstances ... an intake interview is an indispensable part of the mandated preliminary inquiry, or whether the goals and objectives of the preliminary inquiry can be accomplished absent such an interview.\u201d <em>Kevin Eugene C., </em>90 Md.App. at 89, 599 A.2d 1233. \u201cWhen faced with a situation where an interview with the child was not held, the court should inquire as to the reason and, if not satisfied with the intake officer\u2019s explanation, may take such action as it believes appropriate under the circumstances, including dismissal of the petition.\u201d Id. at 92, 599 A.2d 1233.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>We have held that an intake interview is not required if the \u201cjuvenile refuses to participate or is unable to participate,\u201d and have noted that dismissal is <em>not \u201ca </em>necessary, automatic sanction that must be applied in every case where an intake interview was not held.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 93, 599 A.2d 1233. But \u201cthe purpose of Maryland\u2019s juvenile statute [to rehabilitate] is not ordinarily best served by dismissal of the proceedings,\u201d <em>In re Keith </em>W., 310 Md. 99, 106, 527 A.2d 35 (1987), and \u201c[o]nly the most extraordinary and egregious circumstances should be allowed to dictate dismissal as the sanction for [a] violation of a procedural rule.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 109, 527 A.2d 35; <em>see also In re Timothy C., </em>376 Md. 414, 434-435, 829 A.2d 1024 (2003). Dismissal is appropriate if the State deliberately files a petition before an intake interview is conducted and without taking into account input from the Juvenile Services Administration. <em>State v. Patrick A., </em>312 Md. 482, 492-93, 540 A.2d 810 (1988). Similarly, a policy that \u201cautomatically recommend[s]\u201d that the State file a petition, regardless of intake interviews, circumvents the statutory purpose. <em>Steven B., </em>84 Md.App. at 8, 578 A.2d 223 (affirming dismissal of petitions); <em>see also In re Keith G., </em>325 Md. 538, 546, 601 A.2d 1107 (1992) (reversing dismissal and distinguishing <em>Patrick A., </em>312 Md. 482, 540 A.2d 810 and <em>Steven B., </em>84 Md.App. 1, 578 A.2d 223, respectively). Overall, though, the rehabilitative purpose of juvenile statutes may well be better served by erring on the side of engagement rather than reflexive procedural dismissal:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b88-5\">[T]he foremost consideration in the disposition of a juvenile proceeding should be a course of treatment and rehabilitation best suited to promote the full growth and development of the child.... [T]he judge must keep in mind the overriding purpose of the juvenile statute along with the fact that this purpose will ordinarily not be served by dismissal of the juvenile proceeding.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b88-6\"><em>Keith W., </em>310 Md. at 109, 527 A.2d 35 (affirming lower court\u2019s refusal to dismiss a petition based on a violation of Maryland Rule 11-114, which prescribes the timing requirements for adjudicatory hearings).</p>\n<p id=\"b89-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>This case presents no procedural failing or inappropriate policy that justified dismissal. The State did not file the Petition in Cristian\u2019s case until after the Intake Officer investigated the allegations and made a recommendation to proceed. The Intake Officer did not conduct an intake interview, but only because he believed Cristian would be unavailable due to the pending charges in the assault action. This case does not present an \u201cextraordinary circumstance\u201d warranting dismissal of the Petition simply because an intake interview was not conducted. <em>See Keith W., </em>310 Md. at 109, 527 A.2d 35. To the contrary, the record reveals that Cristian had a lengthy history with DJS leading up to this incident,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> and the Intake Officer likely was already aware of Cristian\u2019s history and the circumstances surrounding this particular arrest. The Intake Officer readily could conclude from this record that Cristian needed the services DJS could provide him.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> His decision to authorize the Petition without an intake interview continued DJS\u2019s engagement with him, and the circuit court judge ultimately found that Cristian \u201cis still ... amenable to services\u201d and properly continued Cristian\u2019s probation, pursuant to DJS\u2019s recommendation.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-5\"><em>Second, </em>even if Cristian was entitled to an intake interview and could have participated in one, there is no evidence that the five-day delay in the initial filing of the Complaint caused him actual prejudice. Under CJP \u00a7 3-8A-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>10(n), a court \u201cmay dismiss a petition or a peace order request for failure to comply with this section[, in this case filing the Complaint beyond the fifteen-day window,] <em>only if the respondent has demonstrated actual </em>prejudice.\u201d CJP \u00a7 3-8A-10(n) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b90-4\">Although the statute does not define \u201cactual prejudice,\u201d we look to the related area of speedy trial violations in criminal prosecutions.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> In <em>Barker v. Wingo, </em>407 U.S. 514, 92 S.Ct. 2182, 33 L.Ed.2d 101 (1972), the Supreme Court established four factors, including prejudice, that we analyze to determine whether a defendant\u2019s right to a speedy trial has been violated. <em>Id. </em>at 530, 92 S.Ct. 2182. Within the prejudice analysis, the Court indicated three \u201cinterests of defendants which the speedy trial right was designed to protect,\u201d namely: \u201c(i) to prevent oppressive pretrial incarceration; (ii) to minimize anxiety and concern of the accused; and (iii) to limit the possibility that the defense will be impaired.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 532, 92 S.Ct. 2182; <em>see also State v. Bailey, </em>319 Md. 392, 415, 572 A.2d 544 (1990) (noting that \u201cin the determination of the speedy trial question, each case rests on its own facts!, and the] determination must be made upon an overall view of the circumstances peculiar to each particular case, keeping in mind not only the rights of the defendant but also the interests of society.\u201d); <em>Boone, </em>55 Md.App. 663, 670, 465 A.2d 1195 (1983); <em>Butler v. State, </em>214 Md.App. 635, 655, 78 A.3d 887 (2013). The Court also recognized that out of these interests, the defendant\u2019s need to build a strong case is paramount because an impaired defense could threaten \u201cthe fairness of the entire system.\u201d <em>Barker, </em>407 U.S. at 532, 92 S.Ct. 2182; <em>see also Wilson v. State, </em>148 Md.App. 601, 639, 814 A.2d 1 (2002) (\u201cThe most important factor establishing prejudice ... is the inability to prepare one\u2019s defense.\u201d). Maryland courts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>have adopted the <em>Barker </em>test in both criminal and juvenile proceedings. <em>See, e.g., In re Thomas </em>J., 372 Md. 50, 77, 811 A.2d 310 (2002); <em>Wilson, </em>148 Md.App. at 639, 814 A.2d 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-4\">Cristian does not argue that he has faced oppressive pretrial incarceration, and he conceded that the five-day delay in the filing of the Complaint was \u201cnot an impairment to [his] defense.\u201d He did contend at the adjudicatory hearing that waiting for the State to file the Complaint caused him \u201canxiety and nervousness,\u201d though he does not mention this point in his brief. His primary argument is that had he had an opportunity to participate in an intake hearing, he might have persuaded the Intake Officer not to recommend the Petition at all. Beyond hopefulness or speculation, nothing in the record supports this argument and, as we discussed above, there is ample evidence to support the Intake Officer\u2019s decision to recommend the Petition. Cristian has admitted that he was prejudiced <em>only </em>if the Intake Officer would not have submitted the Petition after conducting an intake hearing with hi m, and the link between what could have happened and actual prejudice is too hypothetical and attenuated.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-5\">JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR MONTGOMERY COUNTY AFFIRMED.

In addition to Cristian\u2019s run-ins with the law documented in Note 10, in November 2013, Cristian also faced the adult charges for first-degree assault (later <em>not </em>prossed) that the Intake Officer referenced here. In March 2013, Cristian was again arrested on first-degree assault charges, as well as conspiracy and participation in a criminal gang. On April 30, 2013, DJS filed a request for a statutory emergency hearing because Cristian's whereabouts were unknown.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b90-5\">. This analysis is consistent with Cristian\u2019s arguments below, in which he invoked <em>Boone v. State, </em>55 Md.App. 663, 465 A.2d 1195 (1983), which in turn cites the three factors for establishing prejudice from <em>Brady v. State, </em>291 Md. 261, 267, 434 A.2d 574 (1981). <em>Boone, </em>55 Md.App. at 670, 465 A.2d 1195; <em>see also Barker v.
