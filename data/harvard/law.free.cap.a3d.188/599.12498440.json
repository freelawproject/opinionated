As a result, in that case and cases that followed in which the issue was properly preserved, we vacated decisions where the change in disability status had been based on IREs performed using the Fifth or subsequent editions of the\n   <em>\n    Guides\n   </em>\n   and remanded the matters for evaluation using the Fourth Edition of the\n   <em>\n    Guides\n   </em>\n   , which was in effect when Section 306(a.2) was enacted.

In the intervening time between\n   <em>\n    Protz I\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Protz II\n   </em>\n   , a number of claimants whose disability status had been modified based on what are now considered unconstitutional IREs, such as Paulette Whitfield (Claimant), filed petitions seeking to have their status reinstated from partial disability to total disability.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   At issue before us is whether Claimant is entitled to the benefit of\n   <em>\n    Protz II\n   </em>\n   when her disability status had been modified in 2008 and she had not challenged the constitutionality of the IRE upon which the modification was based for more than seven years. Because Claimant filed her Petition to Reinstate (Petition) within three years of the date of the most recent payment of compensation, we hold she has a statutory right to seek reinstatement under Section 413(a) of the WC Act, 77 P.S. \u00a7 772. Accordingly, we vacate the Order of the Workers' Compensation Appeal Board (Board) dated May 10, 2017, which affirmed the Decision and Order of the Workers' Compensation Judge (WCJ) denying Claimant's Petition. However, because the WCJ made no determination as to whether Claimant continues to be totally disabled, which is a prerequisite for reinstatement, we must remand for further proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n    <em>\n     Factual Background\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The facts of this matter are not in dispute. Claimant worked as a respiratory therapist for Tenet Health System Hahnemann LLC (Employer). On March 25, 2002, she suffered a work injury that ultimately required her to undergo lower back surgery. From March 25, 2002, until September 28, 2002, Claimant received partial disability benefits for the time in which she performed alternative work. She began receiving temporary total disability benefits beginning September 29, 2002, the day of her surgery.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On June 13, 2006, Claimant underwent an IRE performed by Dr. Leonard Brody, using the Fifth Edition of the\n   <em>\n    Guides\n   </em>\n   . Dr. Brody concluded that Claimant had an impairment rating of 44 percent.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Based upon that IRE, a WCJ modified Claimant's disability status from total to partial disability as of the date of the IRE. The Board affirmed the modification by Order dated June 1, 2009. The parties stipulated that Claimant did not raise the constitutionality of the IRE before the original WCJ or the Board. Although Claimant's disability status was modified from total to partial, because she was not able to return to work following her surgery, Claimant received WC benefits at the total disability rate from September 29, 2002, until mid-July 2015,\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   when she received her last WC payment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Claimant testified she continued to receive medical benefits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On November 13, 2015, approximately one month after our decision in\n   <em>\n    Protz I\n   </em>\n   , Claimant filed her Petition seeking reinstatement to total disability based on that decision. Employer filed a timely Answer to the Petition on November 17, 2015, alleging reinstatement is not warranted for three reasons: (1) \"\n   <em>\n    Protz\n   </em>\n   [\n   <em>\n    I\n   </em>\n   ] ha[d] not been given retroactive effect\"; (2) Claimant waived the constitutional issue; and (3) \"[t]he law of the case doctrine prevents re-litigation of the change to partial disability status.\" (Answer, Reproduced Record (R.R.) at 9a.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   At hearings on the Petition, Claimant testified that she did not feel as though she had fully recovered from her injuries and that she had been unable to work at all from the time of her surgery through July 15, 2015. There was also evidence that Claimant was involved in a motor vehicle accident in May 2012, in which she injured her head, neck, and upper back, but not her lower back. The parties stipulated many of the facts surrounding the IRE.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Following the hearings, the WCJ issued an Order denying Claimant's Petition. After recounting our holding in\n   <em>\n    Protz I\n   </em>\n   , the WCJ found that Claimant was not entitled to reinstatement of her benefits based upon\n   <em>\n    Protz I\n   </em>\n   for a number of reasons:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   a) in\n   <em>\n    Protz\n   </em>\n   [\n   <em>\n    I\n   </em>\n   ], the Commonwealth Court did not expressly void all prior [IREs] or state that its decision applied retroactively; b) in Pennsylvania, generally only those matters that are pending in any phase of litigation, including appeal, or future matters are entitled to a benefit in the change of the law, and the litigation in the instant matter ended on June 1, 2009; [and] c) the constitutionality of Section 306(a.2) was not raised or preserved in the underlying litigation.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   (WCJ Decision, Finding of Fact (FOF) \u00b6 9, April 19, 2016, R.R. at 40a (footnote omitted).) The WCJ cited this Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Winchilla v. Workers' Compensation Appeal Board (Nexstar Broadcasting)\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=126%20A.3d%20364\">\n    126 A.3d 364\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Pa.

(\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 9 n.1.) Because of the WCJ's disposition, she did not make a finding regarding Claimant's credibility. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 10.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Claimant appealed. In a 4-3 decision, the Board affirmed. The majority found Claimant waived the right to challenge the constitutionality of the IRE. Citing\n   <em>\n    Riley v. Workers' Compensation Appeal Board (Commonwealth of Pennsylvania)\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12315732\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/154/396/\">\n    154 A.3d 396\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Pa. Cmwlth. 2016), the Board found Claimant did not challenge the constitutionality\n   of the IRE before the WCJ or the Board when her change in status was first being litigated. (Board Opinion (Op.) at 3-4.) Furthermore, the Board noted that Claimant did not appeal the Board's June 1, 2009 order, in which the Board affirmed the original WCJ decision modifying her status to partial disability. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3.) The Board also explained that a claimant may appeal a change in status at any time during the 500-week period of partial disability so long as the claimant presents evidence of a revised impairment rating of at least 50 percent. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4 (citing\n   <em>\n    Riley\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12315732\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/154/396/\">\n    154 A.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   400 n.5 ).) However, the Board held that Claimant was not entitled to a modification of her disability status because she failed to present such evidence. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The Board dissent disagreed with the Board majority's conclusion that Claimant's change in disability status was final. The dissent distinguished\n   <em>\n    Riley\n   </em>\n   , noting in\n   <em>\n    Riley\n   </em>\n   the claimant attempted to challenge the IRE more than 500 weeks after the change in disability status, whereas Claimant here filed her petition within the 500-week period following her change in disability status.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Board Dissenting Op. at 1.) Because Claimant's status was changed on June 13, 2006, and her Petition was filed on November 13, 2015, the dissent found she challenged the constitutionality within the 500-week period found in Section 306(a.2)(4); therefore, her case was not \"final.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The dissent further found that\n   <em>\n    Protz I\n   </em>\n   should be applied retroactively because it satisfied the criteria for retroactive application in\n   <em>\n    Blackwell v. State Ethics Commission\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1827711\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/pa/527/172/\">\n    527 Pa. 172\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1827711\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/pa/527/172/\">\n    589 A.2d 1094\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1991). (Board Dissenting Op. at 2.) The first criterion is the purpose to be served by the new rule. The dissent concluded that \"applying\n   <em>\n    Protz\n   </em>\n   [\n   <em>\n    I\n   </em>\n   ] retroactively to the instant case serves the important purpose of mandating conformity with the constitution.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Otherwise, \"[a]llowing claimants to have their disability status, and ultimately have their benefits completely cut off, based upon an IRE that was based upon an unconstitutional section of the [WC] Act greatly prejudices those claimants and blocks the main purpose of the\n   <em>\n    Protz\n   </em>\n   [\n   <em>\n    I\n   </em>\n   ] decision.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) With regard to the second criterion-the extent of the reliance on the old rule-the dissent noted that \"the IRE process is inherently not a final process, and remains an open case for 500 weeks past the time that a claimant's disability status is changed.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Because the\n   <em>\n    Guides\n   </em>\n   could change and claimants retain a right to challenge their status during this 500-week period, the dissent found \"employers have never had full reliance that a change in a claimant's disability status to partial will be final as that change only becomes final once the 500[-]week period has expired.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2-3.) In terms of the final criterion, which is the effect on the administration of justice by retroactive application of the new rule, the dissent found\n   \"there would be limited effect.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3.) The dissent believed \"there would be a more adverse effect on the administration of justice if\n   <em>\n    Protz\n   </em>\n   [\n   <em>\n    I\n   </em>\n   ] was not retroactively applied to [cases in which the 500-week period had not expired], as these are not final cases.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) If\n   <em>\n    Protz I\n   </em>\n   is not given retroactive effect, the dissent stated \"it would lead to the absurdity that claimants would have the right to appeal IREs, but have no actual remedy to carry through on that appeal, as the right to appeal would be based upon a now unconstitutional section of the [WC] Act.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Claimant petitioned for review of the Board's Order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n    <em>\n     Analysis\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   On appeal,\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Claimant argues the\n   <em>\n    Protz\n   </em>\n   decisions apply and she is entitled to have her disability status restored from partial to total disability because the IRE upon which the change was based was unconstitutional and invalid. Claimant contends this case is \"strikingly similar\" to our recent decision in\n   <em>\n    Thompson v. Workers' Compensation Appeal Board (Exelon Corporation)\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12327883\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/168/408/\">\n    168 A.3d 408\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Pa. Cmwlth. 2017), in which we reversed the Board's affirmance of a WCJ's decision modifying a claimant's disability status from total to partial. (Claimant's Brief (Br.) at 8.) Claimant also argues that reinstatement petitions may be filed within three years of the date of last payment, which is satisfied here. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   In addition, Claimant argues justice and public policy require retroactive application of\n   <em>\n    Protz II\n   </em>\n   . Because\n   <em>\n    Protz II\n   </em>\n   struck the entirety of the IRE provision from the WC Act, Claimant asserts that injured employees no longer have a statutory remedy to seek a change in status, and \"by eliminating the statutory process for an employee to challenge his or her IRE-based partial disability status, the [Supreme] Court could not have intended to bind forever claimants to a partial disability status that was unconstitutionally enacted.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 13.) Moreover, Claimant emphasizes the remedial nature of the WC Act and stresses it should be liberally construed in favor of injured workers. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 14.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Employer argues that reinstatement is not warranted because, at the time\n   <em>\n    Protz II\n   </em>\n   was decided, \"[C]laimant had already conclusively litigated the change in her benefit status, collected 104 weeks of temporary total disability benefits, and collected the entire[t]y of her 500 weeks of temporary partial disability benefits.\" (Employer's Br. at 11.) Employer contends that employers have relied on these now-invalid IREs, which largely went unchallenged until the\n   <em>\n    Protz\n   </em>\n   decisions. Employer explains:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   [w]hile the statutory scheme set forth in Section 306(a.2) of the [WC] Act allowed a claimant to prove an entitlement to temporary total disability benefits at some point within the\n   <strong>\n    future\n   </strong>\n   of that 500 week period, presuming he/she was able to demonstrate a total person impairment of 50 [percent] or greater, the statute did not provide a claimant with 500 weeks within which to look back and invalidate a\n   <strong>\n    past\n   </strong>\n   IRE and the corresponding change in benefit status.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 15 (emphasis in original).) Here, Employer argues that Claimant fully litigated her change in benefit status a decade ago but never challenged the constitutionality of the IRE provisions during that\n   litigation. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 15-16, 18.) According to Employer, if the Court were to give retroactive effect to\n   <em>\n    Protz II\n   </em>\n   , the parties' expectation of finality would be upset. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 17.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    A.\n    <em>\n     <em>\n      Protz I\n     </em>\n     and\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     <em>\n      II\n     </em>\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Before we reach the merits of this appeal, it is important to understand the holdings that have gotten us to this point:\n   <em>\n    Protz I\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Protz II\n   </em>\n   . Like this case, the facts in\n   <em>\n    Protz\n   </em>\n   were not in dispute. The claimant suffered a work injury in 2007. Although she returned to work for a short time, her \"work injury recurred\" and her benefits were reinstated.\n   <em>\n    Protz I\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6840818\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/124/406/6840818/#p417\">\n    124 A.3d at 408\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In October 2011, Claimant underwent an IRE performed by a physician using the Sixth Edition of the\n   <em>\n    Guides\n   </em>\n   . Based upon that IRE, the employer filed a modification petition, which the WCJ granted, converting the claimant's total disability benefits to partial disability benefits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The claimant appealed to the Board and asserted that Section 306(a.2) of the WC Act was an unconstitutional delegation of legislative authority in violation of the Pennsylvania Constitution.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Section 306(a.2) provided, in pertinent part, that a claimant's impairment rating shall be determined \"pursuant to the most recent edition of the [AMA\n   <em>\n    Guides\n   </em>\n   ].\" 77 P.S. \u00a7 511.2. At the time the section was added, the Fourth Edition of the\n   <em>\n    Guides\n   </em>\n   was in effect. Because the impairment rating for the same injury could vary between editions of the\n   <em>\n    Guides\n   </em>\n   , a claimant may be determined to be more or less impaired under one edition than another edition. The claimant in\n   <em>\n    Protz\n   </em>\n   argued that Section 306(a.2) effectively gave the AMA, rather than the General Assembly, authority to establish the criteria under which a claimant's disability status is determined.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   On September 18, 2015, this Court rendered its decision in\n   <em>\n    Protz I\n   </em>\n   . We recognized that the General Assembly may delegate its legislative power but not without constraints. First, \"the basic policy choices must be made by the Legislature,\" and second, the \"legislation must contain adequate standards which will guide and restrain the exercise of the delegated administrative functions.\"\n   <em>\n    Protz I\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6840818\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/124/406/6840818/#p417\">\n    124 A.3d at 413\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quotations omitted). With those principles in mind, we held that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   the General Assembly [ ] failed to prescribe\n   <strong>\n    any\n   </strong>\n   intelligible standards to guide the AMA's determination regarding the methodology to be used in grading impairments. Section 306(a.2) of the [WC] Act is wholly devoid of any articulations of public policy governing the AMA in this regard and of adequate standards to guide and restrain the AMA's exercise of this delegated determination by which physicians and WCJs are bound.

Without any parameters cabining its authority, the AMA would be free to: (1) concoct a formula that yields impairment ratings which are so inflated that virtually every claimant would be deemed to be at least 50 [percent] impaired; or (2) draft a version of the\n   <em>\n    Guides\n   </em>\n   guaranteed to yield impa[ir]ment ratings so miniscule that almost no one who undergoes an IRE clears the 50 [percent] threshold; or (3) do anything in between those two extremes. The AMA could add new chapters to the\n   <em>\n    Guides\n   </em>\n   , or it could remove existing ones. It could even create distinct criteria to be applied only to claimants of a particular race, gender, or nationality.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   Consider also that the AMA could revise the\n   <em>\n    Guides\n   </em>\n   once every ten years or once every ten weeks. If the AMA chooses to publish new editions infrequently, Pennsylvania law may fail to account for recent medical advances. By contrast, excessive revisions would likely pose severe administrative headaches, inasmuch as the\n   <em>\n    Guides\n   </em>\n   automatically have the force and effect of law once published. As these hypotheticals illustrate, the General Assembly gave the AMA\n   <em>\n    de facto\n   </em>\n   , unfettered control over a formula that ultimately will determine whether a claimant's partial-disability benefits will cease after 500 weeks.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   Equally problematic, the General Assembly did not include in Section 306(a.2) any of the procedural mechanisms that this Court has considered essential to protect against \"administrative arbitrariness and caprice.\" The General Assembly did not, for example, require that the AMA hold hearings, accept public comments, or explain the\n   grounds for its methodology in a reasoned opinion, which then could be subject to judicial review. Further, the AMA physicians who author the\n   <em>\n    Guides\n   </em>\n   are, of course, not public employees who may be subject to discipline or removal.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12325597,12278717\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/161/827/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12325597,12278717\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/161/827/\">\n    at 835-36\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal footnotes and citations omitted).\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   While the Supreme Court affirmed this Court to the extent it found Section 306(a.2) unconstitutional, it\n   <strong>\n    reversed\n   </strong>\n   as to the remedy.

The claimant there appealed to the Board, challenging the constitutionality of Section 306(a.2), but the Board affirmed, noting it could not decide constitutional issues. The claimant appealed to this Court and in his petition for review merely stated that \"the IRE provisions ... as applied to [the claimant] and/or facially, are unconstitutional, as they are capricious, arbitrary, not reasonably calculated, confiscatory, not used to assess disability in the [WC] sense, improperly disregard evidence that [the claimant] was totally disabled and improperly extinguish rights.\"\n   <em>\n    Winchilla\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=126%20A.3d%20364\">\n    126 A.3d at 367\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting the claimant's petition for review \u00b6 8).

The Board refused to address the issue because the claimant had not previously appealed the WCJ's decision or challenged the constitutionality of the IRE.

The claimant, in his answer, challenged the constitutionality of the IRE process and continued to do so throughout the litigation before the WCJ, the Board, and our Court.

If a claimant did not satisfy those statutory time requirements, we held he or she could not challenge the IRE. However, post-\n   <em>\n    Protz II\n   </em>\n   , those statutory time requirements were no longer valid and we allowed a claimant to raise the constitutionality of the IRE for the first time outside of those time periods, but while the litigation involving the change in status was still pending.\n   <em>\n    Thompson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12327883\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/168/408/\">\n    168 A.3d at 412\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   <strong>\n    C.\n    <em>\n     Present Appeal\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Having summarized the development of the law, we turn to the merits of\n   the instant appeal. Claimant argues she is entitled to reinstatement of her disability status from partial to total because she filed her reinstatement petition within three years after the date of her most recent payment of compensation, and the IRE upon which the modification of her disability status was based is invalid. She claims her case is most analogous to\n   <em>\n    Thompson\n   </em>\n   because she filed her reinstatement petition at the first available opportunity, just one month after our decision in\n   <em>\n    Protz I\n   </em>\n   . She also argues that\n   <em>\n    Protz\n   </em>\n   should be applied retroactively. Employer, however, argues against retroactive application, stressing that Claimant did not raise the constitutionality of the IRE at any time during the underlying litigation related to the IRE itself and she cannot do so now because it would upset Employer's reasonable expectation of finality.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   In this case, Claimant filed a reinstatement petition, which is governed by Section 413(a) of the WC Act. That section, in relevant part, provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-59\">\n   A workers' compensation judge designated by the department may, at any time, modify,\n   <strong>\n    reinstate\n   </strong>\n   , suspend, or terminate a notice of compensation payable, an original or supplemental agreement or an award of the department or its workers' compensation judge, upon petition filed by either party with the department,\n   <strong>\n    upon proof that the disability of an injured employe has increased, decreased, recurred, or has temporarily or finally ceased\n   </strong>\n   , or that the status of any dependent has changed.

We begin by noting that the term \"disability\" is a term of art in the workers' compensation context. Generally, \"disability\" is synonymous with loss of earning power resulting from a work-related injury.\n   <em>\n    Westmoreland Reg'l Hosp. v. Workers' Comp. Appeal Bd. (Stopa)\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9399869\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/789/413/#p416\">\n    789 A.2d 413\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 416 (Pa. Cmwlth. 2001). \"Disability\" may also refer to a\n   <strong>\n    status\n   </strong>\n   , which is linked to the rate or amount of compensation to which a claimant is entitled. Traditionally, this status was linked to a claimant's earning power. Under Section 306(b) of the WC Act, 77 P.S. \u00a7 512, an employer could modify a claimant's total disability benefits to partial disability by showing the claimant had earning power. Section 306(b)(2) provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-63\">\n   \"Earning power\" shall be determined by the work the employe is capable of performing and shall be based upon expert\n   opinion evidence which includes job listings with agencies of department, private job placement agencies and advertisements in the usual employment area. Disability partial in character shall apply if the employe is able to perform his previous work or can, considering the employe's residual productive skill, education, age and work experience, engage in any other kind of substantial gainful employment which exists in the usual employment area in which the employe lives within the Commonwealth. If the employe does not live in this Commonwealth, then the usual employment area where the injury occurred shall apply. If the employer has a specific job vacancy the employe is capable of performing, the employer shall offer such job to the employe. In order to accurately assess the earning power of the employe, the insurer may require the employe to submit to an interview by a vocational expert who is selected by the insurer and who meets the minimum qualifications established by the department through regulation.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   77 P.S. \u00a7 512(2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   The addition of Section 306(a.2) to the WC Act in 1996 provided another method of changing a claimant's disability status from total to partial disability, but this time,\n   <strong>\n    without regard\n   </strong>\n   to any change in a claimant's earning power. Section 306(a.2)(1) provided:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-66\">\n   When an employe has received total disability compensation pursuant to clause (a) for a period of one hundred four weeks, unless otherwise agreed to, the employe shall be required to submit to a medical examination which shall be requested by the insurer within sixty days upon the expiration of the one hundred four weeks to determine the degree of impairment\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n   due to the compensable injury, if any. The degree of impairment shall be determined based upon an evaluation by a physician who is licensed in this Commonwealth, who is certified by an American Board of Medical Specialties approved board or its osteopathic equivalent and who is active in clinical practice for at least twenty hours per week, chosen by agreement of the parties, or as designated by the department, pursuant to the most recent edition of the American Medical Association \"Guides to the Evaluation of Permanent Impairment.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   77 P.S. \u00a7 511.2(1). Section 306(a.2)(2) provided that a claimant \"shall be presumed to be\n   <strong>\n    totally disabled\n   </strong>\n   \" if an IRE shows an\n   <strong>\n    impairment rating\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    20\n   </footnotemark>\n   equal to or greater than 50 percent, while if the impairment rating is less than 50 percent, the claimant is considered\n   <strong>\n    partially disabled\n   </strong>\n   . 77 P.S. \u00a7 511.2(2) (emphasis added). Under Section 306(a.2)(3), \"the amount of compensation shall not be affected as a result of a change in disability status and shall remain the same.\" 77 P.S. \u00a7 511.2(3). In other words, a claimant considered partially disabled under Section 306(a.2) may still receive benefits at the total disability rate, which is sixty-six and two-thirds per centum of the injured worker's wages. Section 306(a)(1) of the WC Act, 77 P.S. \u00a7 511(1). The practical effect of a change in status from total to partial disability is to limit a claimant to 500 weeks of partial disability compensation. 77 P.S. \u00a7 512(1) ;\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   <em>\n    Diehl v.

Because earning power did\n   <strong>\n    not\n   </strong>\n   play any role in Claimant's change from total to partial disability here, we discern no reason why the term \"disability\" in Section 413(a) governing reinstatement from partial to total disability in this case should be restricted to its traditional definition of earning power.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Ford Motor/Visteon Sys. v.

As the above case law demonstrates, disability can also be a\n   <strong>\n    status\n   </strong>\n   , where the claimant is either totally or partially disabled, as here, based upon impairment rating not earning power.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Next, we must consider whether Claimant's disability status \"increased, decreased, recurred, or has temporarily or finally ceased.\" 77 P.S. \u00a7 772. Under the facts here, Claimant may establish entitlement to reinstatement if her disability status \"recurred.\" \"Recur\" is defined, in relevant part, as \"\n   <strong>\n    to return to a\n   </strong>\n   place or\n   <strong>\n    status\n   </strong>\n   \" or \"to happen, take, place, or appear again.\" Webster's Third New Int'l Dictionary 1900 (2002) (emphasis added). The legal effect of\n   <em>\n    Protz I\n   </em>\n   and subsequently\n   <em>\n    Protz II\n   </em>\n   was to render Claimant once again eligible for total disability benefits.\n   <footnotemark>\n    21\n   </footnotemark>\n   The impediment that rendered her partially disabled under the WC Act,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , the\n   <strong>\n    impairment rating\n   </strong>\n   , is no longer a valid means of changing a claimant's status. There was no longer a legal basis for Claimant's disability status to remain partial because the IRE upon which the change in status was predicated was found, as a matter of law, unconstitutional and invalid. This change in the law was a basis upon which Claimant could seek reinstatement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   The current scenario is more akin to a claimant seeking reinstatement of benefits currently under suspension than one seeking reinstatement of benefits following termination because there is no allegation\n   that Claimant's disability has ceased.

However,\n   <em>\n    Stanek\n   </em>\n   is distinguishable in that the claimant there did not have his status changed based upon an impairment rating; rather, the claimant there received partial disability benefits based upon a change in his earning power. In\n   <em>\n    Stanek\n   </em>\n   , after the claimant exhausted his 500 weeks of partial disability, he sought reinstatement on the basis that his physical condition had worsened, rendering him totally disabled. Thus, the standard enunciated by the Supreme Court, requiring evidence of a loss of earning power and a worsening of the claimant's physical condition, under these circumstances makes sense. However, for claimants whose change in disability status was never based on either a change in earning power or a change in physical condition, but solely on an impairment rating, it does not. It makes little sense to require a claimant seeking reinstatement based upon an unconstitutional IRE to show a change in earning power when the employer was not required to show the same when it had the claimant's disability status modified from total to partial. Furthermore, in some cases, a claimant will not be able show a\n   <strong>\n    change\n   </strong>\n   in earning power because his or her earning capacity remains at zero. Moreover, because the change in disability status was not linked to any change in physical condition, but only to an impairment rating, it does not\n   make sense to require claimants to show their physical condition worsened.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   Here, Claimant testified she was unable to work at all since the date of her surgery in 2002.

Allowing Claimant to seek modification under these circumstances does not prejudice employers or insurers by upsetting their expectation of finality because such determinations are not yet truly \"final\" until three years have passed since the date of last payment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    24\n   </footnotemark>\n   However, in order to be entitled to reinstatement, a claimant must testify that her work-related injury continues, and the WCJ must credit that testimony over any evidence that an employer presents to the contrary. Here, Claimant testified she continues to be disabled by her work injury, but the WCJ did not make any credibility determinations, instead disposing of the case on the ground\n   <em>\n    Protz I\n   </em>\n   did not apply.

In her April 19, 2016 Decision, addressing the November 2015 reinstatement petition at issue in this case, the WCJ found Claimant was paid at the total disability rate until July 17, 2015. (WCJ Decision, Finding of Fact (FOF) \u00b6 6c, Apr. 19, 2016, Reproduced Record (R.R.) at 39a.) Claimant testified at the hearing that the last date of payment was July 13, 2015. (Hr'g Tr., Nov. 18, 2015, at 7, R.R. at 17a.) The WCJ said at the hearing that the payment printout showed she was paid through July 13, 2015, but the date on the check was July 15, 2015. (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 8, R.R. at 18a.) The July 15, 2015 date is what counsel also stipulated to as the last date of payment at the December 21, 2015 hearing. (Hr'g Tr., Dec. 21, 2015, at 6-7.) However, in an April 14, 2016 Decision, addressing separate reinstatement and penalty petitions filed in July 2015 by Claimant, the WCJ found Claimant was paid at the temporary total disability compensation rate until July 13, 2015, when Employer ceased payment. (WCJ Decision, FOF \u00b6 3c, Apr. 14, 2016, R.R. at 31a.) The WCJ further found Claimant had not yet exhausted her 500 weeks of partial disability benefits at that time and ordered Employer to pay Claimant such benefits through August 19, 2015. (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6\u00b6 7-8, R.R. at 32a.) At oral argument, counsel for Claimant stated that those benefits for the weeks of July 13, 2015, through August 19, 2015, were actually received in April 2016, shortly after the WCJ issued the April 14, 2016 Decision. Because the date discrepancy does not impact our analysis in this case, we will simply refer to the date of last payment as occurring in the summer of 2015.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-92\">\n    While it is true that Claimant filed her Petition within 500 weeks of the\n    <strong>\n     change in status\n    </strong>\n    , which was June 13, 2006, the dissent then went on to cite Section 306(a.2)(4), which provides, in relevant part, that \"[a]n employe may appeal the change to partial disability at any time\n    <strong>\n     during the five-hundred week period of partial disability.\n    </strong>\n    \" 77 P.S. \u00a7 511.2(4) (emphasis added). Here, Claimant had already received 20 weeks and 6 days of partial disability benefits in 2002, leaving her with just 479 weeks, 1 day before her 500 weeks of partial disability benefits were exhausted. Although she did not actually receive payment on approximately four weeks of partial disability until April 2016, those benefits were for the period of July 13, 2015, through August 19, 2015. Therefore, Claimant exhausted her benefits in the summer of 2015 but did not file her Petition until November 2015. Thus, Claimant did not file her Petition \"during the five-hundred week period of partial disability.\"\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"6\">\n   <p id=\"p-93\">\n    This Court's review in workers' compensation appeals is limited to determining whether necessary findings of fact are supported by substantial evidence, whether an error of law was committed, or whether constitutional rights were violated.\n    <em>\n     Elberson v.
