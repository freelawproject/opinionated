I believe Judge Genece Brinkley should have disqualified herself pursuant to Pa. R.Crim.P. 903(C) (providing PCRA trial judge should disqualify themselves in the interests of justice) as her continued involvement has created an appearance of impropriety that tends to undermine public confidence in the judiciary.
