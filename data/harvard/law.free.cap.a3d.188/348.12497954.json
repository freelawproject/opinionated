Decedent was using a motorized cart. As she went down a narrow aisle, her cart's basket caught on a cash register station, causing the station to fall on her. The accident injured her leg. Decedent stated she was fine and went home, but four days later she was taken to the hospital with complications. She died the following morning.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   After a deputy medical examiner inspected decedent's body, a Certificate of Death was issued. The Certificate stated that the manner of her death was an \"accident\" and that the cause of death was \"complications of blunt trauma of [the] right lower extremity.\" The examiner's associated report reiterated these conclusions in more detail.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The key legal issue in this appeal is whether the State Medical Examiner Act, N.J.S.A. 52:17B-92, mandates the admission before a civil jury of the Certificate of Death and the hearsay opinions it contained. In addition, we consider whether the hearsay exception for vital statistics, N.J.R.E. 803(c)(9), supplies a sufficient pathway for the Certificate's admissibility. As part of that analysis, we\n   consider whether the \"net opinion\" doctrine, N.J.R.E. 808 (disallowing the admission of certain disputed complex opinions embedded in otherwise-admissible hearsay records), and case law require the exclusion of the examiner's hearsay opinions. The panel also considers whether the trial court misapplied its discretion in declining to reopen and extend discovery under the circumstances, and whether the court erred in granting summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   For the reasons that follow, we hold that N.J.S.A. 52:17B-92 does not provide an absolute right to a civil plaintiff to admit the full contents of the Certificate of Death. The hearsay opinions within the Certificate were properly excluded by the trial court under N.J.R.E. 808, the net opinion doctrine, and pertinent case law. We also hold the hearsay exception for vital statistics does not require admission of the examiner's opinions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Additionally, we conclude the trial court reasonably exercised its discretion in declining to reopen and extend discovery after declaring the Certificate inadmissible. Nor did the court err in granting defendant summary judgment, in light of plaintiff's lack of necessary expert proof of medical causation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On October 19, 2012, plaintiff William Quail and his wife, decedent Mary Quail (\"Mary\"),\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   were shopping in Stanhope at the \"Shop-Rite of Byram\" supermarket. Mary used a motorized shopping cart, but had difficulty maneuvering through the checkout aisle. When the cart's grocery basket caught the edge of a register station, the register station collapsed and fell on Mary's right leg. A cashier asked if Mary was alright or needed help, and Mary responded at the time that she was fine but a little shaken. The cashier called the store manager, who also asked Mary about her condition. According to the manager's written statement, Mary stated at the time that she was fine and not hurt at all.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   When Mary returned home, her leg began to swell, but she did not seek immediate medical attention. Four days later, on October 23, Mary was taken to St. Clare's Hospital. She presented with a large hematoma on her right leg. Mary's condition deteriorated rapidly. She was pronounced dead at the hospital at 5:51 a.m. on October 24, 2012.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Generally, when a person dies within twenty-four hours after admission into a hospital, the Morris County Medical Examiner is notified to inspect the body. Accordingly, on October 24, Dr. Carlos A. Fonseca, a forensic pathologist and deputy county medical examiner, externally inspected decedent's refrigerated body and prepared a report. The following day, a Certificate of Death was issued. It stated decedent's manner of death was an \"accident,\" and that the cause of death was \"complications of blunt trauma of [the] right lower extremity.\" The Certificate was issued by the Local Registrar, and bears the sealed signature of the Acting State Registrar of the New Jersey Office of Vital Statistics and Registry.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Dr. Fonseca's associated three-page report amplified the findings noted on the Certificate of Death. The report described decedent as \"a morbidly obese, well developed, elderly white female who appears to be the stated age of 68 years.\" The report included observations about the decedent's condition as to various parts of her body. One of Dr. Fonseca's observations in the report was that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   The right lower extremity reveals mild pitting edema from the knee level down.\n   <em>\n    The\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    right leg reveals extensive swelling of the anterolateral surface due to a 9? x 7? hematoma\n   </em>\n   . Associated with this is purplish/bluish bruising of the back of the leg extending into the popliteal fossa that reveals thickening of the skin. The skin overlying the hematoma is tense and with fluctuation on compression. A large area of epidermolysis measuring 7? x 4? is noted at this level with superficial ulceration of the skin with partial splitting of the dermis and oozing of clear to hemorrhagic fluid. Patchy areas of skin slippage are noted around the margins of the hematoma.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   [ (Emphasis added).]\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Near the end of the report, Dr. Fonseca opined:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   Based on the investigation, medical history, medical records, and external examination,\n   <em>\n    it is my opinion that the deceased died as a consequence of complications of\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    blunt trauma of right lower extremity having as contributory conditions\n   </em>\n   anticoagulation therapy for atrial fibrillation, diabetes mellitus, coronary artery disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and congestive heart failure.\n   <em>\n    Manner of death is accidental\n   </em>\n   .\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   [ (Emphasis added).]\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Thereafter, plaintiff, as administrator of his late wife's estate and individually, filed a civil action in the Law Division against Shop-Rite\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   and fictitious defendants. He asserts claims under the Wrongful Death Act, N.J.S.A. 2A:31-1 to -6, and under the Survivor Act, N.J.S.A. 2A:15-3. Both claims rest upon a theory that decedent's accident was caused by the supermarket's negligence, allegedly causing her leg injury and ultimate death.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Shop-Rite contests liability and resultant damages. With respect to the issues on appeal, its main argument is that plaintiff, who did not retain a medical expert, failed to present sufficient evidence to establish medical causation. Plaintiff counters that such causation is substantiated by the Certificate of Death, a document which Shop-Rite contends is inadmissible hearsay and net opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   After discovery ended, Shop-Rite moved to bar admission of the Certificate of Death and also for summary judgment dismissing plaintiff's claims. Following oral argument, Judge Robert M. Hanna barred the findings within the Certificate of Death. He also denied a discovery extension to plaintiff and granted Shop-Rite summary judgment. The judge issued a comprehensive twenty-page statement of reasons explaining his determinations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   At the outset of his written analysis, Judge Hanna found that plaintiff had presented sufficient evidence to support a jury finding that Shop-Rite acted negligently. The judge noted in this regard that Shop-Rite had a duty to ensure that its store aisles\n   were safe for motorized shopping carts. He found that plaintiff had offered ample proof of a breach of that duty, and that such an issue of negligence was within the common knowledge of the jurors.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Nevertheless, the judge ruled that plaintiff would be unable to show proximate cause without expert testimony. Because plaintiff had retained no such medical expert, defendant was entitled to summary judgment as a matter of law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The judge reasoned that complex medical issues were involved in linking the accident at the store with decedent's demise five days later. The judge recognized that plaintiff had proffered the Certificate of Death as evidence of proximate causation. The judge assumed, for the purposes of his decision, that the Certificate of Death would be potentially admissible at trial under N.J.R.E. 803(c)(9) as a \"vital statistic.\" Even so, the judge found that the Certificate of Death must be excluded for three reasons:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   (1) [S]tanding alone, it is a \"net opinion\" lacking the whys and wherefores on which it is based;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   (2) Plaintiff during discovery failed to identify as a witness the Deputy Medical Examiner whose opinion as to cause of death is found in the Certificate of Death and failed to produce the underlying Medical Examiner's report and records providing the basis for that opinion; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   (3) N.J.R.E. 808 requires exclusion in these circumstances, which involve complex medical circumstances and medical causation issues, since the declarant (the Deputy Medical Examiner) whose expert opinion is included in the Certificate of Death was not identified as an expert witness nor were his underlying report and records produced during discovery.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Judge Hanna found it significant that plaintiff had not sought to obtain the medical examiner's file until after the discovery period had already ended. That discovery violation constituted an additional reason to exclude the Certificate of Death. The judge found that plaintiff failed to show due diligence under\n   <em>\n    Rule\n   </em>\n   4:17-7 or exceptional circumstances under\n   <em>\n    Rule\n   </em>\n   4:24-1(c) to justify reopening discovery. The judge observed that plaintiff had made a \"conscious, strategic decision\" to rely on the Certificate of Death alone. Plaintiff had not identified the deputy medical examiner as\n   an expert, nor had he retained an expert, even though those options were available to him during discovery.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Represented by new counsel, plaintiff moved for reconsideration. Judge Hanna\n   denied the motion, issuing a five-page supporting statement of reasons. The judge reiterated that plaintiff \"failed to provide the necessary causal link by coming forward with an expert opinion on the element of proximate causation.\" The judge also repeated his original finding that the Certificate of Death, \"as the sole piece of evidence provided on the issue,\" was inadequate to support plaintiff's burden of proving Shop-Rite's conduct was a substantial cause of decedent's death or injuries.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   As another point addressed on reconsideration, the judge rejected plaintiff's argument that the dismissal of his survivorship action, as distinct from his wrongful death claim, was improper. In this regard, the judge noted that plaintiff critically lacked necessary expert opinion proof \"establishing the causal link between the Shop[-]Rite incident and [d]ecedent's pain and suffering prior to her death, a link that involve[d] complex medical issues.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   This appeal by plaintiff ensued. He principally contests the trial court's evidential rulings concerning the Certificate of Death. He also seeks reversal of the court's denial of a discovery extension and its grant of summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   The State Medical Examiners Act, N.J.S.A. 52:17B-92, states, in relevant part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   It shall be the duty of the State Medical Examiner,\n   <em>\n    and the county medical examiners\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    to keep full and complete records\n   </em>\n   in their respective offices, properly indexed, giving the name, if known, of every such person, the place where the body was found, date and cause of death, and all other available information relating thereto....\n   <em>\n    The records\n   </em>\n   of the office of the State Medical Examiner, and\n   <em>\n    of the county medical examiners, made by themselves or by anyone under their direction or supervision, or transcripts thereof certified by such medical examiner, shall be received as competent evidence in any court in this State of the matters and facts therein contained\n   </em>\n   ...

The laws sought to address \"considerable apprehension upon the part of the judiciary and the prosecutor\n   <em>\n    concerning proof in homicide cases\n   </em>\n   and the records of the county physician pertaining thereto.\"\n   <em>\n    Sponsor's Statement to S175\n   </em>\n   (Mar. 6, 1944) (emphasis added). The 1944 Sponsor added, \"This act will also\n   <em>\n    facilitate criminal investigations\n   </em>\n   when the disinterment of a body becomes necessary.

The medical examiner had died before trial. The Court held his report was admissible, because the trial court had \"excis[ed] from it all matters of opinion as to the cause of death and other conclusions made by the examining doctor with regard to the place and manner of death.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 68,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=248%20A.2d%20425\">\n    248 A.2d 425\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Plaintiff did not move to extend discovery prior to the setting of the trial date. Plaintiff could not have reasonably expected in light of the precedent in\n   <em>\n    Reddick\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Theer\n   </em>\n   , to rely on the Certificate of Death as his sole medical proof of causation. The court justifiably determined that plaintiff had not demonstrated\n   \"exceptional circumstances\" to justify an extension of discovery under\n   <em>\n    Rule\n   </em>\n   4:24-1(c).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   Nor did the court act arbitrarily or unfairly in disallowing plaintiff's effort to amend his interrogatory answers under\n   <em>\n    Rule\n   </em>\n   4:17-7 in order to rely on the medical examiner's narrative. Plaintiff and his former counsel had access to the Certificate of Death early on in the case. During the course of discovery, they did not attempt to procure the medical examiner's report or retain an expert. Plaintiff obtained the medical examiner's narrative only after discovery had ended and defendant already had moved for summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   Even if the trial court, in its discretion, had granted plaintiff the opportunity to extend discovery and amend his interrogatory answers to include the medical examiner's narrative report, that would not\n   have overcome the critical hearsay problem we have already discussed in Part II. The narrative report is filled with opinions and conclusions, which are barred under\n   <em>\n    Reddick\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Theer\n   </em>\n   , and N.J.R.E. 808, in the absence of testimony from the examiner himself. There is no indication in the present record that this county official is willing to testify as an expert at trial for plaintiff. The record is bereft of any attempt, as of the time of the motion practice, to proffer the medical examiner as a trial expert witness for plaintiff. Hence, an extension of discovery to include the bare report likely would have been futile.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   IV.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   Lastly, we consider the trial court's entry of summary judgment in Shop-Rite's favor, given the state of the record. In doing so, we apply the familiar principle that, on a motion for summary judgment, the court must consider \"whether the competent evidential materials presented, when viewed in the light most favorable to the non-moving party, are sufficient to permit a rational factfinder to resolve the alleged disputed issue in favor of the non-moving party.\"\n   <em>\n    Brill v.

To evaluate how this accident injuring the decedent's right leg could have been a substantial factor in her death over the course of a few days involves a highly technical assessment of not only the foot injury but also the interaction of decedent's underlying medical problems and medications. The topic is plainly outside the common knowledge of the average juror.\n   <em>\n    2175 Lemoine Ave. Corp. v.
