Although the court granted Copan's motion for summary judgment after finding no genuine issues of material fact and determining that Copan was entitled to judgment as a matter of law, Copan filed a cross-appeal to preserve its separate argument that Puritan's claim was preempted by federal patent law. Because we conclude that Puritan's claim is preempted, we affirm the grant of summary judgment in favor of Copan on other grounds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   I. BACKGROUND\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   [\u00b6 2] Puritan and Copan both produce flocked swabs\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   that are sold throughout the world. Copan has developed, produced, and marketed flocked swabs since 2003 and currently holds patents in both Europe and the United States. Headquartered in Italy, Copan also maintains facilities in China and the United States and employs 450 people. In 2015, Copan produced over 50 million flocked swabs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   [\u00b6 3] Puritan also manufactures flocked swabs. Based in Guilford, Maine, Puritan employs 250 people. In 2010, Puritan applied for patents relating to flocked swabs and began producing, marketing, and selling its flocked swabs in countries where Copan holds patents.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   [\u00b6 4] In 2011, Copan became concerned that some of Puritan's flocked swabs infringed its European and United States patents. Copan alleged that it commissioned external and performed internal examinations of Puritan's flocked swabs to compare them to Copan's patents.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Based on the results of that testing, Copan sent a letter to Puritan's distributor on June 8, 2011, communicating its belief that Puritan's swabs infringed Copan's patents.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   [\u00b6 5] In 2012, Copan filed a claim against Puritan in Germany, alleging infringement of its German utility models,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   which evolve from its European patents. Through those proceedings, Copan received additional information about the composition of Puritan's flocked swabs from tests performed by two court-appointed experts. Copan interpreted the results of the tests to confirm that Puritan's flocked swabs fall within the scope of protection afforded by some of Copan's patents. Puritan denies that the\n   experts' findings confirmed infringement. Although aspects of the German proceedings are still pending, Copan won a utility model infringement case against Puritan in 2014 and, in 2015, one of its European patents and a utility model were confirmed to be valid.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   [\u00b6 6] In the spring of 2015, Copan learned that Puritan's flocked swabs may have been offered as part of a bid by a distributer, GE Healthcare Life Sciences, to supply the French Gendarmerie with forensic products. Copan sent letters to GE Healthcare\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   and the French Gendarmerie, explaining that Puritan's flocked swabs may infringe upon Copan's patents. The French Gendarmerie did not accept GE Healthcare's offer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   [\u00b6 7] In September 2015, Puritan filed a complaint in the Superior Court in Piscataquis County against Copan pursuant to Maine's Actions for Bad Faith Assertion of Patent Infringement statute.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   14 M.R.S. \u00a7\u00a7 8701 - 8702. Shortly thereafter, the case was transferred to the Business and Consumer Docket. Copan answered the complaint and asserted affirmative defenses, including that Puritan's claim was preempted by United States federal patent law.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   After more than one year of discovery, Copan moved for summary judgment, arguing that federal patent law preempted Puritan's claim and, in the alternative, that the record showed no genuine issue of material fact on the merits and that it was entitled to summary judgment as a matter of law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   [\u00b6 8] The court granted Copan's motion for summary judgment. It concluded (1) that it had jurisdiction to consider Puritan's claim because it was not preempted by federal patent law, and (2) that there were no genuine issues of material fact and Copan was entitled to summary judgment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   [\u00b6 9] Puritan filed an appeal from the summary judgment, and Copan filed a cross-appeal, challenging the court's conclusion that Puritan's claim was not preempted by federal law.

The statute does not define the phrase \"bad faith assertion\" but lists factors a court may consider to determine whether a defendant has made a bad faith assertion, including certain deficiencies in the demand letter; a demand for payment of a fee within an unreasonably short period of time; actual or constructive knowledge by the patent holder that the assertion of patent infringement was meritless; and the deceptive nature of the assertion. 14 M.R.S. \u00a7 8701(3)(A). The statute also lists factors that a court may consider as evidence that a defendant did\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   make a bad faith assertion: the demand letter was not deficient; the defendant made a good faith effort to establish that the plaintiff infringed the patent; the defendant made a substantial investment in the use of the patent or in the production or sale of a product or item covered by the patent; and the defendant demonstrated good faith business practices in previous efforts to enforce the patent or a substantially similar patent. 14 M.R.S. \u00a7 8701(3)(B).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   [\u00b6 21] With this understanding of the state law, our task is to determine whether its application in this case is in conflict with federal patent law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   C.

The protection offered by section 8701 is particularly important to discourage bad faith claims related to the manufacture of health care products and devices. In this field, patent litigation is used to attempt to create monopolies on particular products that some exploit to charge exorbitant prices and reap huge profits from the sale of drugs and other products that cost little to manufacture-escalating the already high cost of health care to the detriment of the public health and welfare.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   [\u00b6 30] The dispute here involves absorbent swabs, absorbent material on the head of a thin stick, commonly available and applied to a variety of uses in forensic medicine, personal care, and health care. From the depictions in the record, the products at issue are, in reality, glorified \"Q-tips.\" The parties are disputing whether the manner of attaching the absorbent material to the head of the stick by inserting strands of the material into the head of the stick is subject to a patent giving Copan Italia a monopoly on swabs with absorbent material attached in that manner.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   [\u00b6 31] The Court's opinion aptly summarizes the purposes and importance of Maine's product protection law.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-54\">\n   In 2014, Maine's Legislature enacted 14 M.R.S. \u00a7\u00a7 8701 - 8702, entitled Actions for Bad Faith Assertion of Patent Infringement.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   P.L. 2013, ch. 543 (effective Aug. 1, 2014).

After review, the court concluded that Puritan Medical Products Company LLC had failed to establish any dispute as to material fact that Copan Italia's assertions of patent infringement were made in bad faith. Because Puritan had not established the element of bad faith required for a section 8701 claim, the trial court granted Copan's motion for summary judgment. Because the trial court properly evaluated the materials before it and granted summary judgment, we should affirm that grant of summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   [\u00b6 33] Instead of affirming the trial court's grant of summary judgment, the Court elects to reach out, invoke the federal law of preemption, and hold that, considering the materials before it, the trial court erred in even reaching the merits of the section 8701 bad faith claim. The Court holds, in effect, that the section 8701 claim in this case, and, by implication, most section 8701 claims, are preempted by federal patent law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   [\u00b6 34] The federal law of preemption presents a question of the constitutionality of application of state law, here section 8701, as preempted by the Supremacy Clause, art. VI, cl. 2, of the United States Constitution. The Court states: \"The Supremacy Clause of the United States Constitution states that the 'Constitution, and the Laws of the United States ... shall be the supreme Law of the Land.' U.S. Const. art. VI, cl. 2. Federal preemption of state law takes three forms: express preemption, field preemption, and conflict preemption.\" Court's Opinion \u00b6 13 (citing\n   <em>\n    English v. Gen. Elec.
