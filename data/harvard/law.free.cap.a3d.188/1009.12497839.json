In response to a question regarding whether he could proffer any evidence of mitigating factors that would be presented at an evidentiary hearing, Blair\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   responded that, after being convicted, he conducted himself \"honorably and decently\"; \"helped other inmates\"; \"tried to follow the law\"; \"wrote books\"; and \"worked with\" his counsel. Blair stated that, if this Court ordered an evidentiary hearing on mitigating factors, he would call at least twenty character witnesses, who, he proffered, would testify that he is \"a good, decent person.\"\n   At oral argument, Blair's counsel stated that, if this Court ordered an evidentiary hearing on mitigating factors, Blair would attempt \"to show that the crimes [of] which he was convicted ... were not an example of intentional dishonest conduct.\" Blair's counsel explained that, for example, his conviction for making a false statement was based on him stating that he did not remember a matter. Blair's counsel also stated that Blair would offer evidence to establish \"all the circumstances that were going on, what was going on in his mind, in his head, at that particular time, and to also present the character of [ ] Blair-the type of person [who] he is at this time.\" After being asked whether he could name any mitigating factors that this Court's case law has identified to which Blair's circumstances corresponded, Blair's counsel said he would offer the following:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-57\">\n   [W]hat I do have to offer this Court is that [ ] Blair is now sixty-seven years old. He has dedicated his life to being an attorney. Right now, he is probably ... comparatively best at what he has prepared all his life to do. That he's had time in jail to think about the mistakes that he's made. That ... he's needed in the community. His services are needed. He's prepared to offer those services to those folks who need him the most.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Blair's counsel advised that witnesses would testify as to the purported need for his services.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   To resolve the issue of whether an evidentiary hearing is warranted, we must examine Maryland Rules 19-722 (Order Designating Judge and Clerk), 19-727 (Judicial Hearing), and 19-738 (Discipline on Conviction of Crime). Maryland Rule 19-722(a) states: \"Upon the filing of a Petition for Disciplinary or Remedial Action, [this] Court [ ] may enter an order designating [ ] a judge of any circuit court to hear the action[.]\" Maryland Rule 19-727(b)(2) provides that, at an evidentiary hearing, \"[t]he attorney may offer, or the [hearing] judge may inquire regarding, evidence otherwise admissible of any remedial action undertaken by the attorney relevant to the allegations of misconduct[.]\" Maryland Rule 19-727(d) states that, after an evidentiary hearing, the hearing judge must file a written statement that includes, among other things, \"findings as to any aggravating or mitigating circumstances that exist.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   While Maryland Rule 19-722 applies to all petitions for disciplinary or remedial action, Maryland Rule 19-738 is specific to petitions for disciplinary or remedial action that are based on a lawyer's conviction for a serious crime. Maryland Rule 19-738(c)(1) provides that, \"[u]pon receiving and verifying information from any source that an attorney has been convicted of a serious crime, Bar Counsel may file a Petition for Disciplinary or Remedial Action[.]\" Maryland Rule 19-738(g) governs further proceedings as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-61\">\n   When a petition filed pursuant to section (c) of this Rule alleges the conviction of a serious crime and the attorney denies the conviction, the Court of Appeals may enter an order designating a judge pursuant to Rule 19-722 to hold a hearing in accordance with Rule 19-727.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-62\">\n   (1)\n   <em>\n    No Appeal of Conviction.\n   </em>\n   If the attorney does not appeal the conviction, the hearing shall be held within a reasonable time after the time for appeal has expired.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-63\">\n   (2)\n   <em>\n    Appeal of Conviction.\n   </em>\n   If the attorney appeals the conviction, the hearing shall be delayed, except as provided\n   in section (h) of this Rule,\n   <sup>\n    [\n   </sup>\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   <sup>\n    ]\n   </sup>\n   until the completion of appellate review.\n   (A) If, after completion of appellate review, the conviction is reversed or vacated, the judge to whom the action is assigned shall either dismiss the petition or hear the action on the basis of evidence other than the conviction.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-64\">\n   (B) If, after the completion of appellate review, the conviction is not reversed or vacated, the hearing shall be held within a reasonable time after the mandate is issued.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-65\">\n   (3)\n   <em>\n    Effect of Incarceration.\n   </em>\n   If the attorney is incarcerated as a result of the conviction, the hearing shall be delayed until the termination of incarceration unless the attorney requests an earlier hearing and makes all arrangements (including financial arrangements) to attend the hearing or waives the right to attend.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Maryland Rule 19-738(i) provides for the conclusive effect of a final judgment of conviction, stating:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-67\">\n   In any proceeding under this Chapter, a final judgment of any court of record convicting an attorney of a crime, whether the conviction resulted from acceptance by the court of a plea of guilty or nolo contendere, or a verdict after trial, is conclusive evidence of the attorney's guilt of that crime. As used in this Rule, \"final judgment\" means a judgment as to which all rights to direct appellate review have been exhausted. The introduction of the judgment does not preclude the Commission or Bar Counsel from introducing additional evidence[,] or the attorney from introducing evidence or otherwise showing cause why no discipline should be imposed.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Plainly, there is no need for a hearing judge to determine whether Blair committed the serious crimes in question, as he has not denied his convictions-to the contrary, he has unequivocally admitted them. In the Petition for Reinstatement, Blair noted that he was convicted of all fourteen counts of the Superseding Indictment, and that the Fourth Circuit had affirmed thirteen convictions and reversed one. At oral argument, Blair stated: \"I accept, and I admit, [that] I am convicted of these crimes.\" Additionally, Blair's counsel agreed with the Court that Blair does not deny his convictions, and instead that Blair simply disputes the events that underlay his convictions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   This attorney discipline proceeding is not a proper venue for Blair to contest his guilt. \"The integrity of a [ ] conviction cannot be attacked in a disciplinary proceeding by invoking this Court to reweigh or to re-evaluate the [attorney]'s guilt or innocence.\"\n   <em>\n    Attorney Grievance Comm'n v.

Bar Counsel initiated this attorney discipline proceeding by filing the Petition for Disciplinary or Remedial Action on May 3, 2010, within five months after Blair was convicted on December 15, 2009. There\n   was no unreasonable delay on Bar Counsel's part in initiating this attorney discipline proceeding. To be sure, approximately seven-and-a-half years passed between the May 3, 2010 filing of the Petition for Disciplinary or Remedial Action and the January 30, 2018 filing of the Motion for Final Disposition or, in the Alternative, Further Proceedings. But, the time lapse is attributable to Blair's failure to comply with his obligations to report the outcome of his appeal. Blair was required to promptly notify Bar Counsel of the Fourth Circuit's opinion disposing of the first appeal in his criminal case, but failed to do so. When the Fourth Circuit issued its opinion in 2011, former Maryland Rule 16-771 governed discipline of lawyers who had been convicted. Former Maryland Rule 16-771(a) stated: \"An attorney charged with a serious crime in this State or any other jurisdiction shall promptly inform Bar Counsel in writing of the criminal charge. Thereafter,\n   <strong>\n    the attorney shall promptly notify Bar Counsel of the final disposition of the charge in each court that exercises jurisdiction over the charge.\n   </strong>\n   \" (Emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   Blair did not inform Bar Counsel of the Fourth Circuit's opinion for more than six years,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , until after he was released from federal custody. On December 1, 2017, after he had been released from custody, Blair filed the Petition for Reinstatement, in which he advised Bar Counsel for the first time that the Fourth Circuit had affirmed thirteen of his convictions. Within two months of Blair's notification, on January 30, 2018, Bar Counsel filed the Motion for Final Disposition or, in the Alternative, Further Proceedings, recommending disbarment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   At oral argument, Deputy Bar Counsel stated that, generally, the Office of Bar Counsel attempts to track the status of a lawyer's criminal case, and acknowledged that such tracking apparently did not occur here. To the extent that the Office of Bar Counsel attempts to track the status of a lawyer's criminal case, this does not relieve a lawyer of the obligation under the Maryland Rules to report the disposition of a criminal case. To the contrary, former Maryland Rule 16-771(a) and current Maryland Rule 19-738(b) obligate a lawyer to promptly\n   advise Bar Counsel of certain events in his or her criminal case.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   Thus, any delay in this attorney discipline proceeding's disposition is attributable to Blair, and does not mitigate his misconduct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   In addition, the potential that remorse may be a mitigating factor does not warrant ordering an evidentiary hearing, or dissuade us from the conclusion that disbarment is the appropriate sanction. In the Renewed Petition for Reinstatement and Response to the Attorney Grievance Commission's Recommendation for Sanction, Blair apologized \"for any wrong judgment he made\" that led to his criminal case. At oral argument, Blair stated: \"I'm here to apologize for any wrong\"; and \"I accept responsibility for this.\" In the Petition for Reinstatement, Blair states that his crimes \"were not motivated by ill[ ]will to anyone[ ] or greed, and he did not cause harm to anyone[,] as there [were] no victims in his [criminal] case.\" Given that Blair took some of the drug money for himself, and willfully failed to file federal income tax returns for two years while laundering the drug money during one of those years, the allegation that he was not motivated by greed is dubious. Although the sincerity of one's remorse admittedly may be difficult to assess, nothing in Blair's filings, or his or his counsel's statements at oral argument, rises to the level of establishing compelling extenuating circumstances or mitigating factors that warrant a sanction other than disbarment. There is no reason to order a hearing to develop evidence concerning remorse, as Blair's expressions of remorse are already documented in the record. In light of the number of convictions, the extreme dishonest nature of his conduct, and our case law concerning the sanction for dishonesty and criminal conduct, the existence of remorse does not persuade us that a sanction less than disbarment is warranted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   We are aware that certain circumstances that Blair has alleged may correspond to the mitigating factor of character or reputation. In the Petition for Reinstatement, Blair stated that there are \"attorneys, doctors, and [other] citizens\" who \"have seen [ ] Blair's earnest efforts to earn back ... his good reputation in the community.\" And, at oral argument, Blair proffered that those individuals would testify that he is \"a good, decent person.\" Assuming, for argument's sake, that Blair would be able to establish at an evidentiary hearing the mitigating factor of good character or reputation, this factor, like remorse, does not come close to constituting compelling extenuating circumstances or mitigating circumstances that negate disbarment as the appropriate sanction in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Allenbaugh\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12487889,12176498\" index=\"182\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/450/250/\">\n    450 Md. at 277\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12487889,12487890,12176443,12176498\" index=\"183\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/148/300/\">\n    148 A.3d at 316\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , this Court stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-107\">\n   This Court sanctions a lawyer not to punish the lawyer, but instead to protect\n   the public and the public's confidence in the legal profession.

The sheer volume and egregious nature of Blair's dishonest, criminal conduct is such that neither a determination of remorse or good character or reputation as a mitigating factor warrants the imposition of a sanction less than disbarment. Blair's thirteen convictions make clear that disbarment is necessary to protect the public and to deter other lawyers from embarking\n   on criminal enterprises similar to the one that Blair so brazenly executed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   For the above reasons, we disbar Blair.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   <strong>\n    IT IS SO ORDERED; RESPONDENT SHALL PAY ALL COSTS AS TAXED BY THE CLERK OF THIS COURT, INCLUDING COSTS OF ALL TRANSCRIPTS, PURSUANT TO MARYLAND RULE 19-709(d), FOR WHICH SUM JUDGMENT IS ENTERED IN FAVOR OF THE ATTORNEY GRIEVANCE COMMISSION AGAINST WALTER LLOYD BLAIR.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   Adkins, Harrell and Raker, JJ., concur and dissent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   Concurring and Dissenting Opinion by Harrell, J., which Adkins and Raker, JJ., join.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   I dissent, although with the utmost respect for some of the views, reasons, and outcomes expressed in the Majority opinion. For example, I concur that Respondent's Petition for Reinstatement (Misc. Docket AG No. 44) should be denied, if for no other reasons than Blair's failure to comply with the information - sharing requirements of Md. Rule 19-751(c) and (d).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   That being said, I disagree with the Majority opinion's rush-to-judgment in disbarring Blair, at least at this point in the proceedings under Misc. Docket AG No. 83. I submit that\n   additional fact-finding may be required before a final sanction is imposed. I would remand No. 83 to a judge of the Circuit Court for Prince George's County\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   for an evidentiary hearing limited to the accepted factors of sanction mitigation (as identified in the Majority opinion at 191-92, 188 A.3d at 1023) for why, if at all, the sanction appropriate for Blair's misconduct should be less than disbarment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The judge hearing this matter should make credibility assessments of any witnesses marshalled by Blair and render written findings of fact (and, as may be appropriate, conclusions as to the legal relevance of any evidence offered on any proper mitigation factor).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   I conclude that, because it appears that Blair has not had an opportunity to present evidence of mitigation to a judicial officer or tribunal of any ilk across the disciplinary bodies who have sanctioned him for his misconduct, he should be given that opportunity here.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   <sup>\n    ,\n   </sup>\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   I would not deny\n   Blair this opportunity merely because he and his counsel appeared to be unprepared at oral argument to articulate a more specific proffer of\n   what relevant mitigation evidence they might seek to offer at an evidentiary hearing. Their lack of preparation was understandable because they were not on notice before oral argument that that area of inquiry was likely to arise, given the delay in the proceedings under Misc. AG No 83. As the Majority opinion notes (at Maj. op. 182-83, 188 A.3d at 1018-19), the notion of remanding for a hearing did not arise until oral argument.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Had a remand eceived a fourth vote from this Court, I would have continued Blair's suspension at least until the Court considered the hearing judge's findings and conclusions, any exceptions thereto, and further oral argument.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   Judges Adkins and Raker authorize me to state that they join in the views expressed in this Dissent.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-122\">\n    Effective July 1, 2016, the MLRPC were renamed the Maryland Attorneys' Rules of Professional Conduct, or MARPC, and renumbered.
