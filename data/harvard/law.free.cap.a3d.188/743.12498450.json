Thomasi,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   and the defendant, Edward J. Thomasi, Sr. In AC 39452, the plaintiff appeals from the postdissolution order of the trial court regarding the division of the defendant's defined benefit pension plan. In her appeal, the plaintiff argues that the court erred in determining that the term \"marital portion,\" as used in the parties' marital dissolution agreement regarding a division of the defendant's defined benefit pension plan, clearly and unambiguously provided for the coverture method to be utilized in calculating the marital portion. We conclude that the term, under the limited circumstances of this case, contains a latent ambiguity, and, accordingly, reverse the judgment of the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   In AC 39814, the defendant appeals from the trial court's postdissolution orders denying his motion for alimony modification and interpreting the dissolution agreement to require him to make payments to the plaintiff from his pension plan retroactive to the date of the marital dissolution. On this claim, he makes four arguments that the court erred (1) by finding that he did not experience a substantial change in his financial circumstances justifying a downward modification in his alimony obligation; (2) by declining to consider the plaintiff's receipt of settlement proceeds from a personal injury lawsuit; (3) by improperly taking into consideration his receipt of a pension; and (4) by\n   determining that the dissolution agreement requires him to make pension payments to the plaintiff as of the date of the marital dissolution even though the qualified domestic relations order (QDRO) contemplated by their agreement was not then in place. We agree with the trial court that a fair reading of the agreement requires the defendant to begin making payments from his pension to the plaintiff as of the date of the dissolution. We do not believe, however, that the record supports the court's finding that the defendant's loss of employment was due to his own fault. Accordingly, we reverse in part, and affirm in part, the orders of the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The following facts pertain to both appeals. The defendant began working for the state of Connecticut in November, 1967, and, as a state employee, he participated in the Connecticut state employees retirement system, which features a defined benefit pension program.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The parties were married on April 5, 1991, by\n   which time the defendant had accrued twenty-four years and four months of state service. The defendant retired from state employment on June 1, 2003, after thirty-seven years and six months of service. The marriage of the parties was dissolved on July 22, 2015. Thus, the parties were married for a total of approximately twenty-four years and three months. Although the defendant was employed by the state for a total of 426 months, the parties' marriage spanned 145 months within this period, or approximately 34 percent of the defendant's total period of employment with the state.\n   As part of the parties' property settlement agreement, paragraph 9B of the dissolution agreement provided: \"Husband shall immediately transfer one-half of the marital portion of [h]usband's [s]tate of Connecticut [p]ension [p]lan that is currently in pay status to [w]ife valued as of the date of dissolution and including cost of living over the payment period. This transfer shall be by a QDRO\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   that shall be drafted by Attorney Elizabeth McMahon, with the parties splitting Attorney McMahon's fees equally. The [c]ourt will retain jurisdiction over this entire [p]aragraph to effectuate the intent of the parties.\" (Footnote added.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   AC 39452\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In this appeal, the parties do not dispute that the term \"marital portion\" refers to the amount of pension benefit earned during the course of the marriage, and agree that the plaintiff is entitled to one half of that\n   amount. Thus, the term \"marital portion\" is not patently ambiguous.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   The question remains, however, whether the term, as used in the parties' marital dissolution agreement, contains a latent ambiguity because there is more than one method for calculating the marital portion of a defined benefit pension.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The following additional facts and procedural history are relevant to the resolution of this appeal. Following the marital dissolution, Attorney McMahon sent a letter dated September 17, 2015, along with a drafted domestic relations order to both parties. In the letter, Attorney McMahon stated in relevant part: \"Since the judgment does not specify how to determine\n   the marital portion, I have used a coverture fraction .... If this approach is not acceptable to [either party], please let me know and then contact your attorneys for guidance.\" The September 17, 2015 domestic relations order prepared by Attorney McMahon was signed by the defendant, but not by the plaintiff. On October 26, 2015, Attorney McMahon recirculated a revised domestic relations order, dated September 26, 2015, which corrected a miscalculation in the coverture formula. Later, on December 2, 2015, Attorney McMahon sent a letter to the parties and their prior attorneys stating in relevant part: \"The judgment does not specify how the marital portion is to be calculated, and there is more than one way to do so. My role is to craft an order that is consistent with the judgment; I do not advocate for either party. If the parties cannot reach an agreement on their own, they will have to return to court for clarification of the judgment.\" Pursuant to a request from the defendant's prior counsel, Attorney McMahon drafted a revised domestic relations order on January 11, 2016,\n   that utilized the subtraction method to calculate the marital portion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Following the marital dissolution and over a period of several months, the parties, through counsel, exchanged correspondence regarding their disagreement on how to calculate the marital portion of the defendant's pension in accordance with the terms of the marital dissolution agreement, and both parties filed several motions reflecting their disagreement. In conjunction with these exchanges, the plaintiff received a correspondence from the State of Connecticut Retirement Services Division dated December 9, 2014, which had been sent to the defendant.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   This letter outlined the defendant's participation in the state employees retirement system. The correspondence indicates that as of April 5, 1991, the date of the parties' marriage, the defendant had accrued the right to receive $1833 as a monthly pension benefit upon the normal retirement age of sixty-five. The letter states, as well, that by the time the defendant retired on June 1, 2003, his monthly benefit had risen to $5227.49. As of the date of the parties' marital dissolution, his monthly benefit had risen to $6937.92 due to cost of living increases built into the pension plan. Neither the contents nor accuracy of this letter is disputed by the parties.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   A hearing on the parties' motions was scheduled for May 23, 2016. At the hearing, and in response to arguments that there are different methods to calculate the \"marital portion\" of the defendant's pension benefits,\n   the court stated the following: \"[A]s far as the court is concerned, if Attorney McMahon, the person preparing the qualified domestic relations order says the word marital portion is ambiguous to her, [t]hen, I think you have an argument. The bottom line ... you are going to have to have [Attorney McMahon] in here, to testify, that [the] term is ambiguous.\" The court further opined that it would not permit testimony from other individuals until it heard from Attorney McMahon.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Consequently, on July 7, 2016, the court heard testimony from Attorney McMahon. She stated that when she first reviewed the dissolution agreement, to her, \"marital portion meant one thing.... I have seen\n   other approaches in other cases. That's not how I do it. So I didn't see an ambiguity initially, but ... when a discussion arose and I saw the parties were ... taking different approaches, then I thought either approach could fit what the judgment [stated].\" When the plaintiff's counsel asked Attorney McMahon \"if marital portion, standing alone without any further formula or description, was ambiguous,\" she replied in the affirmative.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On cross-examination by the defendant's counsel, the following exchange occurred:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   \"Q. [W]hen you get no other instruction from the court or from the parties or you see the agreement as you did in this, do you ... normally use the coverture method?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   \"A. I do.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   \"Q. Okay. The subtraction method, is that a method you ever use?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   \"A. Only if it's specified in the judgment.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   On that same day, the court issued an order, stating: \"The court heard evidence on the motions in limine\n   and finds the contract in the separation agreement is clear and unambiguous regarding [paragraph] 9B, 'marital portion.' The last sentence of the paragraph, the court determines means the enforcement of the signing of the [QDRO] by the parties. The other motions are moot. See transcript ... for the elaboration of the court's ruling and findings.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The transcript of the July 7, 2016 hearing reveals that the court stated: \"I see nothing ambiguous or hear nothing and determine nothing ambiguous about the language. It is the typical language that you see ... in a situation such ... as this.... [T]estimony from Attorney McMahon established just that, there is nothing ambiguous. The parties agreed to use Attorney McMahon, therefore, they agreed to use her method of calculation and she clearly testified as to what her method of calculation was. Moreover, [paragraph] 9C of the parties' agreement uses the same ... term, marital portion, and there's no claim of ambiguity there.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Finding no ambiguity in the language of the agreement, the court concluded that the September 26, 2015 domestic relations order which employed the coverture method of determining the marital portion of a monthly pension benefit was the appropriate version to be enforced. This appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   We begin with our standard of review. \"It is well established that a separation agreement, incorporated by reference into a judgment of dissolution, is to be regarded and construed as a contract.... Accordingly, our review of a trial court's interpretation of a\n   separation agreement is guided by the general principles governing the construction of contracts.... A contract must be construed to effectuate the intent of the parties, which is determined from the language used interpreted in the light of the situation of the parties and the circumstances connected with the transaction.... If a contract is unambiguous within its four corners, the determination of what the parties intended by their contractual commitments is a question of law.... When the language of a contract is ambiguous, [however] the determination of the parties' intent is a question of fact, and the trial court's interpretation\n   is subject to reversal on appeal only if it is clearly erroneous.\" (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    Remillard\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Remillard\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4088801\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/297/345/#p354\">\n    297 Conn. 345\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 354-55,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=999%20A.2d%20713\">\n    999 A.2d 713\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2010).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \"[T]he intent of the parties is to be ascertained by a fair and reasonable construction of the written words and ... the language used must be accorded its common, natural, and ordinary meaning and usage where it can be sensibly applied to the subject matter of the contract....

Attorney McMahon testified that determination of the marital portion by this method involves taking \"the benefit earned as of the date of marriage and subtract[ing] it from the benefit earned as of the date of divorce.... [T]he difference would be what they call the marital portion.\" See generally E. Brandt, \" Valuation, Allocation, and Distribution of Retirement Plans at Divorce: Where Are We?\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=35%20Fam.%20L.Q.%20469\">\n    35 Fam.

Snyder, \" Challenges in Valuing Pension Plans,\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=35%20Fam.%20L.Q.%20235\">\n    35 Fam. L.Q. 235\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 249 (2001).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   In her postjudgment motions, the plaintiff, using the subtraction method for determining the marital portion of the defendant's pension and the data provided by the State Retirement Services Division, determined that the defendant's pension benefit had increased by $5104.92 (benefit on date of marital dissolution less accrued benefit on date of marriage) and therefore, her marital portion is half that amount, or $2552.46. On the basis of these calculations and by application of the subtraction method, the plaintiff asserted that her share of the defendant's monthly pension benefit as of the date of the marital dissolution should be 36.7 percent of the defendant's total pension equaling $2552.46.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The defendant does not dispute the mathematical consequences of applying the subtraction method for determining the marital portion of a defined benefit pension plan. He disputes only the propriety of utilizing this approach. Thus, it is not disputed that the defendant's premarital monthly pension value was $1833 as of the date of the marriage and that his pension benefit\n   had risen to $6937.92 as of the date of the marital dissolution. Subtracting the lesser from the greater results in a marital portion of $5104.92, representing the increase in benefit accrued during the course of the marriage. One half of this amount is $2552.46 or 36.7 percent of the total monthly pension payment due to the defendant as of the date of the marital dissolution. As discussed earlier in this opinion, this calculation was reflected in Attorney McMahon's January 11, 2016 domestic relations order draft prepared at the behest of the defendant.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   In contrast, the defendant contends that the parties agreed to execute the September 26, 2015 domestic relations order initially drafted by Attorney McMahon, in which she employed the coverture method of determining the marital portion. There, the defendant indicates that Attorney McMahon used \"the marital portion of the defendant's [s]tate of Connecticut [p]ension [p]lan calculated using the fraction where the numerator equals the number of months married during the years of employment by the defendant and the denominator equals the total years of credited service for the [defendant's] employment by the [s]tate of Connecticut.\" Attorney McMahon testified that the determination of the marital portion by this method involves: \"[Taking] the years of benefits accrued during the marriage over the total years of benefits accrued as of the date of divorce and then multiply that times the benefit earned as of date of divorce and that would give you the marital portion.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Under the coverture fraction, as\n   calculated by Attorney McMahon and recited in her September 17, 2015 letter to the parties, the plaintiff's one half of the marital portion of the monthly pension payment would be $1180.83, or 17.02 percent of the defendant's total pension entitlement as of the date of marital dissolution.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   As noted, the different methods of calculation in this instance yield substantially different portions of the pension benefits to the plaintiff. The plaintiff argues that the court erred when it concluded that the language was clear and unambiguous because Attorney McMahon's preferred methodology for determining the marital portion of a pension is not set forth in paragraph 9B of the dissolution agreement. In short, the plaintiff asserts that the court's reference to factors outside of the language utilized in the agreement is a demonstration itself that the language is not clear and unambiguous and is \"susceptible to more than one reasonable interpretation.\" From the record, and notwithstanding the court's conclusion, Attorney McMahon's testimony plainly supports this conclusion. Nevertheless, the defendant maintains that the court properly found that paragraph 9B of the dissolution agreement unambiguously provided for the domestic relations order to be\n   drafted by Attorney McMahon using the coverture fraction on the basis of her testimony that\n   this is the approach she routinely utilizes in drafting pension division orders.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   \"A latent ambiguity arises from extraneous or collateral facts which make the meaning of a written instrument uncertain although the language thereof be clear and unambiguous. The usual instance of a latent ambiguity is one in which a writing refers to a particular person or thing and is thus apparently clear on its face, but upon application to external objects is found to fit two or more of them equally.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    Heyman Associates No. 1\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Ins. Co. of Pennsylvania\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"740818\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/231/756/#p782\">\n    231 Conn. 756\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 782,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=653%20A.2d%20122\">\n    653 A.2d 122\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1995). That is precisely the circumstance the court faced in the case at hand. Here, the ambiguity of the term \"marital portion\" arises not from the language of the contract itself, but instead from the fact, gleaned from extraneous evidence, that there is more than one method for determining the marital portion of a defined benefit plan. The evidence adduced at the hearing on this issue demonstrates that computations utilizing the two methodologies result in significantly different outcomes in terms of the monthly payments to be received by the nonemployee spouse and, reciprocally, the amount of the monthly benefit to be retained by the employee spouse.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The court determined that the term \"marital portion\" was unambiguous, not on the basis of the language itself, but on the basis that Attorney McMahon, the expert whose services the parties agreed to effectuate their pension agreement, typically uses the coverture method. Although we conclude that the term \"marital portion\" is clear and unambiguous in the sense that the parties agree to its general meaning, the term, nevertheless, contains a latent ambiguity under the specific circumstances of this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   On the basis of our review of the dissolution agreement, we conclude that the trial court incorrectly determined that the language in paragraph 9B is clear and unambiguous. The term \"marital portion\" of the defendant's pension contains a latent ambiguity because the determination of that amount is not self-defining and can be deduced by using more than one methodology, each of which yields a significantly different outcome. Also, the term \"marital portion\" is not elsewhere defined in the dissolution agreement. As noted, although Attorney McMahon expressed a preference for utilizing the coverture method for determining the marital portion of a pension, she, with equal clarity, also acknowledged the legitimacy of the use of the subtraction option for making such a determination.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   Because the term \"marital portion\" can be reasonably susceptible to more than one method of calculation not specified in the parties' agreement, a latent ambiguity exists in the parties' agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   In its decision to rely on extrinsic evidence to resolve the parties' disagreement as to the import of the term \"marital portion,\" the court's focus on Attorney McMahon's usual practice was misplaced. Rather, the task of the court in resolving the ambiguity was to discern the\n   intent of the parties in employing the language at issue.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   See\n   <em>\n    Buell Industries, Inc.\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Greater New York Mutual Ins. Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"360092\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/259/527/\">\n    259 Conn. 527\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 546 n.17,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=791%20A.2d%20489\">\n    791 A.2d 489\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2002) (\"[E]xtrinsic evidence may be introduced to clarify the meaning of terms in an integrated contract.... Such evidence may not be used, however, once the terms are found to have a clear and unambiguous meaning ....\" [Citation omitted; emphasis omitted.] ). Although it was not inappropriate for the court to hear evidence from Attorney McMahon as to her normal approach for determining the marital portion of a defined benefit plan when the particular methodology has not been specified to her, the focus of this testimony should have been on Attorney McMahon's knowledge of the parties' intent in employing the language at hand and whether the parties were aware of her usual practice when referring this matter to her. The court should also have permitted testimony from the parties as to their intentions in employing the language in question.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   And yet, notwithstanding the testimony from Attorney McMahon that there is more than one methodology employed to determine the marital portion of a defined benefit pension, the court concluded that there was \"nothing ambiguous about the language\" because the parties agreed to use Attorney McMahon. In reaching this conclusion, the court was legally incorrect.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Accordingly, the trial court's postjudgment order regarding the division of the defendant's defined benefit pension plan cannot stand.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   II\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   AC 39814\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   As noted previously in this opinion, in AC 39814, the defendant claims that the court incorrectly denied his motion for alimony modification and interpreted the dissolution agreement to require him to make payments to the plaintiff from his pension plan retroactive to the date of the marital dissolution. We review each of his claims in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   At the outset, we note the following additional pertinent facts and procedural history. In her March 18, 2016 motion for contempt, the plaintiff requested, due to the fact that the domestic relations order had not been completed, that the defendant be ordered to make retroactive payments for her portion of his monthly pension benefits effective as of July 22, 2015, the date of the marital dissolution judgment. The court conducted a\n   hearing on September 27, 2016, in which the parties testified and provided argument on the issues of retroactive payments and attorney's fees in response to the plaintiff's motion. The court issued a memorandum of decision on October 6, 2016, in which it determined that the plaintiff's portion of the defendant's monthly pension benefits \"are a property distribution and the amount to be calculated as owed to the plaintiff is to be calculated from the date of dissolution.\" The court declined to grant either parties' requests for attorney's fees. The court denied the defendant's subsequent motion to reconsider and/or reargue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Additionally, on June 24, 2016, the defendant filed a motion to modify alimony alleging a substantial change in his circumstances due to a loss of employment. The defendant filed an amended motion to modify alimony on October 24, 2016, additionally alleging that the plaintiff had a significant increase in her income due to her receipt of a settlement stemming from a claim she had made in an unrelated civil litigation. Following a hearing on November 3, 2016, the court determined that because the defendant \"was clearly not laid off\" and that it was his \"own fault that he's no longer employed,\" his attendant loss of earnings could not be considered in assessing whether he had experienced a substantial change in his financial circumstances. The court further articulated that it considered the defendant's receipt of monthly pension benefits as income. The court determined, as well, that the receipt by each party of certain settlement proceeds from civil litigation should not be considered in assessing whether either had experienced a substantial change in financial circumstances after their marital dissolution because it was \"property distribution.\" Thus, the court denied the defendant's motion to modify alimony in an order dated November 3, 2016. This appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   A\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   We first address the court's denial of the defendant's motion to modify alimony. On appeal, the defendant claims that the court incorrectly determined that he caused his own loss of employment and therefore that factor could not be considered in assessing his quest for a reduction of his alimony obligation. The defendant claims, as well, that the court erred in declining to consider the plaintiff's receipt of lawsuit settlement proceeds in assessing whether she had experienced an upward change in her financial circumstances. Finally, the defendant asserts that the court should not have considered his receipt of pension benefits as income for purposes of assessing his motion for a modification of alimony. We conclude that the record does not support the court's conclusion that the defendant caused his own loss of employment through his own fault. Therefore, the court's order denying the defendant's motion\n   for a modification of alimony premised on this conclusion cannot stand.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Our legal principles and standard of review governing the modification of an award of alimony are well established. \"Our review of a trial court's granting or denial of a motion for modification of alimony is governed by the abuse of discretion standard.... To the extent that the trial court has made findings of fact, our review is limited to deciding whether such findings were clearly erroneous....

Here, the defendant testified that he was laid off from his position as director of facilities at Albertus Magnus College (college) on April 5, 2016, where he had been earning just over $75,000 per year, and that he has been unable to find employment since then. On cross-examination, the defendant acknowledged that a former coworker had brought a pending civil action against him and the college. As evidence of this claim, the plaintiff filed a copy of the revised complaint in that action. The plaintiff also filed a copy of a proposed separation agreement and letter from the college, dated April 5, 2016, addressed to the defendant. Although a representative of the college signed the separation agreement, the defendant did not. The letter states in relevant part: \"This will confirm the discussion that we had today to the effect that your employment with [the college] is terminated as of the close of business today .... If you decline to execute the [separate agreement] ... the [c]ollege's offer to enter into the [separation agreement] will automatically be rescinded as of the close of business on April 26, 2016.\" The defendant testified that he did not sign the agreement because he \"wasn't sure [he] agreed with the severance.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   Thereafter, the defendant received unemployment compensation for twenty-six weeks. The defendant testified that he has continued to seek employment since being terminated by the college but without success.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   The defendant testified that he believes he lost his job because his position was being cut by the college.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   He further stated that the college did not object to his collection of unemployment, which he understood would have been unavailable to him had he been fired. In response to plaintiff's counsel's inquiries as to whether he thought he was at fault for the termination of his employment, the defendant asserted that he was not. The defendant\n   also stated that there were no reprimands or criticisms against him in his personnel file at the college.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   At the end of the hearing, the court calculated that the defendant received a total gross annual income of $92,560 based upon his social security and pension benefits. The court also stated: \"And, quite frankly, I credit the evidence that shows that [the defendant] was clearly not laid off, and I find that [it is] the defendant's own fault that he's no longer employed and making this $75,000 per year.... To qualify for a substantial change in circumstances, a change or alleged inability to pay must be excusable and not brought about by the defendant's own fault. I find credible testimony that it clearly was brought about by his own fault. There's evidence of [the college's] letter .... There's evidence regarding the revised [c]omplaint.... [H]is actions ultimately led to what was clearly ... an offer to either retire or get fired. He was clearly not laid off as he testified to. So I'm making a finding that any reduction in his income was at the fault of the defendant.\" The court concluded that the defendant had not met his burden in demonstrating a significant change in financial circumstances as to warrant a modification and, accordingly, denied his motion to modify alimony.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   As the party seeking the modification, the defendant had the burden of proving a substantial change in his financial circumstances. It is undisputed that the defendant is no longer employed by the college, resulting in a loss of income of approximately $75,000 per year.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Evidence and testimony was presented during the hearing to support this claim. The court also credited the defendant's testimony that he had been actively seeking alternative employment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   In opposition to the defendant's motions to modify alimony, the plaintiff submitted the revised complaint against him and the college, the proposed separation agreement between him and the college, which the defendant never signed, and an accompanying letter. This evidence was proffered to demonstrate that the change in the defendant's circumstances was not excusable because it was brought about by his own fault. Although the court correctly opined that a party who suffers a diminution in earnings through his or her own fault is not thereby entitled to a reduction of an alimony obligation, there was no credible evidence adduced at the hearing on the motion to modify that the defendant, in fact, lost his employment with the college through his own fault.\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   Thus, from our careful review of the record, we conclude that the court's factual conclusion that the defendant caused his discharge from employment through his own fault finds no support in the record. The court's reliance on an unsigned employment separation agreement and a third party's revised complaint as evidence that the defendant caused his own termination of employment was incorrect. In sum, innuendo aside, whether the defendant was laid off or terminated by the college, there was no evidence presented to the court that the defendant's loss of employment was due to his own fault.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   As noted, the defendant testified that his personnel file from the college, which was available during the hearing, contained no reprimands or criticisms regarding his service to the college. The submission of a revised complaint from a former coworker that named the defendant, the college, and others as parties and contained claims for workers' compensation retaliation and infliction of emotional distress, was merely an unproved allegation without any supporting evidence. As such, the mere allegations set forth in this complaint could not suffice as any proof of culpable behavior by the defendant during his employment with the college. Moreover, the complaint contains no allegation that the defendant was terminated due to his own fault.\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   In response, the plaintiff cites this court's opinion in\n   <em>\n    Tittle\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Skipp-Tittle\n   </em>\n   , supra, 161 Conn.

The facts in\n   <em>\n    Tittle\n   </em>\n   and those we face in the present case, however, are not parallel. In\n   <em>\n    Tittle\n   </em>\n   , the court could reasonably consider the moving party's arrests as evidence of fault, because in order for the arrests to occur an independent magistrate had to have found probable cause of culpable conduct. In the case at hand, however, the court was confronted with mere allegations without any factual support.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   In sum, although we recognize it is the duty of a moving party in a motion to modify alimony or support\n   to demonstrate that an inability to pay is not due to his or her own \"extravagance, neglect, misconduct or other unacceptable reason\";\n   <em>\n    Sanchione\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Sanchione\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"698303\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/173/397/#p407\">\n    173 Conn. at 407\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=378%20A.2d%20522\">\n    378 A.2d 522\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ; the court's conclusion in this matter that the defendant was at fault for his loss of employment finds no factual support in the record.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   After reviewing the record, we are \"left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    Spencer\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Spencer\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12491401\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/173/1/#p526\">\n    177 Conn.

Even if we make every reasonable presumption in favor of the court's ruling, the record simply does not support the court's finding that the defendant lost his employment through his own fault. Accordingly, we conclude that the court's determination that the defendant caused his own termination of employment was clearly erroneous as it was not supported by any evidence in the record.

As a result, he asserts that he is required to pay the plaintiff a disproportionate amount from each pension payment because of federal and state tax withholdings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   In response, the plaintiff states that \"an appropriate tax adjustment can be fashioned\" once the marital portion and the dollar amount of the postjudgment payments during the gap period have been calculated, and the defendant establishes the amount of taxes he has already paid.
