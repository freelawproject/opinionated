We agree with the department and, accordingly, reverse the judgments of the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The following facts and procedural history are relevant to our resolution of this appeal. On April 26, 2011, the plaintiff and the defendant, Asia A. M., executed a\n   written acknowledgment of paternity (acknowledgment) for the minor child, who was born in February, 2011. See General Statutes (Rev. to 2011) \u00a7 46b-172 (a) (1). On October 28, 2014, the state filed a support petition against the plaintiff in the name of the defendant. On December 9, 2014, the plaintiff filed a motion to open the judgment pursuant to \u00a7 46b-172,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   challenging the validity of the acknowledgment on the grounds of fraud, mistake of fact, and duress. Specifically, in his affidavit accompanying his motion to open, the plaintiff averred that (1) the defendant committed fraud by \"intentionally conceal[ing] the fact that she had sexual relations with other men\" and \"represent[ing] to the plaintiff that they were in a sexually exclusive relationship\"; (2) a DNA test demonstrated \"that there is a 0 percent chance that [the plaintiff] could be the biological father of the minor child\" and \"[t]he fact of the plaintiff being the biological father is ... a mistake of fact\"; and (3) \"[t]he plaintiff was under duress from the pressure being applied to him by the defendant and other family members, and [he] felt compelled to sign this acknowledgment due to this duress.\" The plaintiff further averred in his affidavit that \"[t]he plaintiff does not have a [parent-child] relationship with the minor child at this time ... and it is in the best interests of the minor child\" to establish the biological father.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On January 6, 2015, the state's support petition and the plaintiff's motion to open were consolidated for a hearing. On February 24, 2015, a hearing was held on the plaintiff's motion to open before a magistrate. On March 3, 2015, relying on\n   <em>\n    Ragin\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Lee\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2496701\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn-app/78/848/\">\n    78 Conn.

In its written order, the magistrate concluded that \"[t]he plaintiff clearly and convincingly proved it is in the best interest of the minor child to open the judgment. A minor child has a fundamental and independent right and compelling interest in an accurate determination of paternity. [ Id., at 863,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=829%20A.2d%2093\">\n    829 A.2d 93\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ].... While the plaintiff did prove it is in the best interest of the child to open the judgment, he failed to prove any of the statutory grounds of fraud, duress or ... mistake. See [General Statutes (Rev. to 2011) ] \u00a7 46b-172 (a) (2).... The credible evidence clearly indicates the plaintiff was aware he was not the biological father of the minor child when he executed the acknowledgment.\n   The defendant did not defraud the plaintiff at the time he signed the acknowledgment. The plaintiff was not under duress when he signed the acknowledgment. The parties were not ... mistaken when the acknowledgment was executed. The motion to open is granted solely based upon the best interest of the minor child.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On March 17, 2015, the state appealed from the decision of the magistrate to the trial court pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 46b-231 (n)\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   and Practice Book \u00a7 25a-29,\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   claiming, inter alia, that \"[i]n the absence of fraud, duress or mistake, the [m]agistrate lacked the [authority] to open the judgment of paternity ....\" A hearing took place on May 5, 2015, before the court, and the parties filed posthearing briefs. On March 29, 2016, the court affirmed the decision of the magistrate in part, and remanded the case to the magistrate to hear additional\n   evidence with respect to the best interests of the child. In its memorandum of decision, the court held that (1)\n   <em>\n    Ragin\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Lee\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2496701\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn-app/78/848/\">\n    78 Conn.

The court further held, however, that \"it was an error of law for the magistrate to open the judgment ... based solely on the results of genetic testing, without sufficient evidence as to other factors affecting the best interests of the child.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On April 11, 2016, the state filed a motion to reargue, which the court denied on April 28, 2016.

The state contends that, pursuant to \u00a7 46b-172 (a) (2), absent a finding of fraud, duress, or material mistake of fact, the magistrate lacked the authority to open the judgment outside of the rescission period, and that the court \"erred in finding that the [f]amily [s]upport [m]agistrate ... did not have to comply with the statutory criteria of ... \u00a7 46b-172.\" In response, the plaintiff and the attorney for the guardian ad litem claim that the court properly concluded that the best interests of the child is a nonstatutory ground for opening an acknowledgment of paternity. We agree with the state.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Paternity may be acknowledged voluntarily and extrajudicially through a written acknowledgment of paternity. See General Statutes (Rev. to 2011) \u00a7 46b-172 (a) (1). \"[T]he acknowledgment procedure provides an alternative to a full scale judicial proceeding, and an agreement reached pursuant to it does not require court approval.

Section 46b-172 (a) (1) sets forth the process by which an acknowledgment may be executed, including the required notices that must be provided to the\n   parties.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   An executed \"acknowledgment of paternity ... shall have the same force and effect as a judgment of the Superior Court.\" General Statutes (Rev. to 2011) \u00a7 46b-172 (a) (1). \"The mother and the acknowledged father shall have the right to rescind such affirmation or acknowledgment in writing within the earlier of (A) sixty days, or (B) the date of an\n   agreement to support such child approved in accordance with subsection (b) of this section or an order of support for such child entered in a proceeding under subsection (c) of this section. An acknowledgment executed in accordance with subdivision (1) of this subsection may be challenged\n   in court or before a family support magistrate after the rescission period only on the basis of fraud, duress or material mistake of fact which may include evidence that he is not the father, with the burden of proof upon the challenger.\" General Statutes (Rev. to 2011) \u00a7 46b-172 (a) (2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   In the present case, the plaintiff and the defendant executed the acknowledgment on April 26, 2011. The plaintiff filed a motion to open the judgment more than three years later, on December 9, 2014. Because the plaintiff did not rescind the acknowledgment within sixty days, he could challenge it \"\n   <em>\n    only\n   </em>\n   on the basis of fraud, duress or material mistake of fact.\" (Emphasis added.) General Statutes (Rev. to 2011) \u00a7 46b-172 (a) (2); see also General Statutes (Rev. to 2011) \u00a7 46b-172 (a) (1) (\"the acknowledgment cannot be challenged after sixty days, except in court upon a showing of fraud, duress or material mistake of fact\"). In its written order, the magistrate explicitly found that there was no fraud, duress, or mistake of fact, stating that \"[t]he credible evidence clearly indicates the plaintiff was aware he was not the biological father of the minor child when he executed the acknowledgment. The defendant did not defraud the plaintiff at the time he signed the acknowledgment. The plaintiff was not under duress when he signed the acknowledgment. [The defendant and the plaintiff] were not ... mistaken when the acknowledgment was executed.\" Consequently, pursuant to \u00a7 46b-172 (a) (2), the magistrate lacked the authority to consider the plaintiff's motion to open the judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Despite this, the magistrate granted the plaintiff's motion to open because it concluded that it was in the child's best interests to do so. Relying on this court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Ragin\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Lee\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2496701\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn-app/78/848/\">\n    78 Conn.

We conclude that it did not.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Ragin\n   </em>\n   , the magistrate rendered a default judgment of paternity against the defendant after he failed to appear at the paternity action, which was initiated by the Commissioner of Social Services on behalf of the state pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 46b-162.

Counsel for the minor child timely filed a motion to open the default judgment, alleging that (1) there was insufficient service of process on the defendant and he did not receive actual notice of the proceedings, and\n   (2) it was in the best interests of the child to open the judgment and order genetic testing to eliminate any doubt regarding the child's biological father.

Importantly, nowhere in the opinion did this court state that the best interests of the child was a basis for opening the judgment as an alternative to the applicable statutory requirements. Rather, this court discussed the best interests of the child in considering the second issue raised on appeal-whether the minor child had standing to file the motion to open. Id., at 861-62,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=829%20A.2d%2093\">\n    829 A.2d 93\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . This court held that the minor child did have standing because, inter alia, \"a child who is the subject of a paternity action has a fundamental interest in an accurate determination of paternity that is independent of the state's interest in establishing paternity for the benefit of obtaining payment for the child's care and any interest that the parents may have in the child.\" Id., at 863,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=829%20A.2d%2093\">\n    829 A.2d 93\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Thus, we look favorably on Judge Keller's concurring opinion in the present case, which sets forth a suggested revision of the statute that would help to achieve accuracy in the acknowledgment of paternity process.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n <opinion type=\"concurrence\">\n  <author id=\"p-35\">\n   KELLER, J., concurring.\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   I concur in the well reasoned analysis and result set forth in the majority opinion. In determining whether the trial court properly has opened a paternity acknowledgement, we are constrained by the statutory authority that our legislature has conferred on family support magistrates in General Statutes \u00a7 46b-172.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   I write separately to draw attention to what I believe is an obvious shortcoming of our acknowledgement of paternity statute, \u00a7 46b-172, which, as the present case illustrates, easily may be abused. I do so not merely in light of my experience as an Appellate Court judge, but in light of my experience as a family support magistrate and a Superior Court judge, all of which has made me keenly aware of the late surfacing problems that frequently arise from the operation of the statute in its current form.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Simply put, questions surrounding a child's paternity readily may be resolved\n   <em>\n    accurately\n   </em>\n   by DNA testing. Fortunately, DNA testing is readily available and far less invasive and costly than it has been in the past. In light of the importance of the issue of a child's paternity,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   I believe it\n   would be worthwhile for our legislature\n   to consider revising the statute such that it requires the Department of Public Health, as a prerequisite to accepting a paternity acknowledgement, to require the submission of DNA testing results that are consistent with the paternity acknowledgement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   In the present case, there is no dispute that the plaintiff, Geoffrey M., Jr.,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   is not the child's biological father. Under \u00a7 46b-172, an acknowledgement of paternity depends upon the accuracy of the representations of the putative father and the mother of the child, not a more reliable source, such as DNA testing. In the present case, the plaintiff and the defendant, Asia A. M., who is the mother of the child at issue, effectively utilized the statute to accomplish an adoption of the child by the plaintiff. They did so with full knowledge that the plaintiff was not the child's biological father, without first having to terminate the parental rights of the biological father, and without having to be subjected to the scrutiny that any proposed adopted parent would be subject to under our established procedures regarding termination of parental rights and adoptions in the juvenile and probate courts. And, given the restrictions in the statute, this court is compelled to perpetuate the fabrication of the plaintiff and the child's mother, the\n   negative effects of which are likely to be deeply personal and long-lasting for the child.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Although I believe that this court has reached the correct result under the current state of our law, I remain hopeful that our legislature will take reasonable steps to ensure accuracy in the acknowledgement of paternity process, thereby preventing consequences such as those reflected in the present case.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-59\">\n    Nearly fifteen years ago, this court, in\n    <em>\n     Ragin v.
