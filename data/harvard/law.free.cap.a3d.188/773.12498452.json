The plaintiff claims that the trial court improperly granted the motion because a genuine\n   issue of material fact existed regarding whether (1) he was a named \"insured\" within the meaning of the policy issued to Wilson Roofing or (2) even if he was not the named insured, he is still entitled to recover pursuant to the policy because he was \"occupying\" a vehicle covered by the policy when he sustained his injuries. We affirm the judgment of the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The record reveals the following facts and procedural history. The plaintiff alleged in his complaint that he was occupying or in the process of exiting a 2001 GMC Savana G3500 in a parking lot in Norwalk when Cristian Zuna, a nonparty, struck him with her 2008 Honda Accord, causing him to suffer injuries. The plaintiff further alleged that any damages he suffered as a result of the accident were covered under a commercial auto policy through which the defendant provided uninsured/underinsured motorist coverage to the plaintiff's business, Wilson Roofing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On May 6, 2016, the defendant filed a motion for summary judgment in which it argued that there is no genuine issue of material fact regarding whether (1) the plaintiff was insured under the policy because he was not \"occupying\" the vehicle at the time of the accident, and (2) the vehicle was not an \"insured auto\" under the policy. The plaintiff filed a motion in opposition to the motion for summary judgment arguing that there was a genuine\n   issue of material fact as to whether he was the named insured within the meaning of the policy or that he was \"occupying\" an insured vehicle at the time he sustained his injuries.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   At his deposition, a transcript of which the defendant attached as an exhibit to its motion for summary judgment, the plaintiff testified that he operates a home improvement company known as Wilson Roofing and\n   Siding, LLC, which has four or five employees.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   On the morning of May 15, 2014, the plaintiff drove to a parking lot at Rick's Main Roofing at 26 Fitch Street in Norwalk. The plaintiff worked for Rick's Main Roofing as a sub-contractor and had two assigned parking spaces in that lot. The plaintiff left for a job assignment and returned to the parking lot at Rick's Main Roofing sometime between 3 and 3:30 p.m. The plaintiff parked his vehicle with the front end of his vehicle facing into the parking space.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   He gathered the papers he needed to take into Rick's Main Roofing, stepped out of the vehicle, and walked toward the rear of the vehicle. After he walked past the rear of his vehicle, he noticed a Honda Civic traveling toward him and was forced to jump onto the front end of the Honda to avoid being hit. He suffered injuries to his left foot after it was caught under the front end of the Honda Civic.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   It is undisputed that the commercial auto insurance policy issued by the defendant to the plaintiff, which was in effect at the time of the accident, provided coverage for some of Wilson Roofing's vehicles. The declarations page of that policy states that the defendant provided commercial auto insurance coverage and that the \"named insured\" was \"Wilson Roofing, LLC.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Following a hearing, the court granted the defendant's motion for summary judgment. The court concluded that the language of the policy was unambiguous\n   and that there was no genuine issue of material fact regarding whether the plaintiff was a named insured within the meaning of the policy. Specifically, the court concluded as a matter of law that Wilson Roofing, and not the plaintiff, was the named insured under the policy. The court also concluded that, even if he was not the named insured, the plaintiff had failed to raise a genuine issue of material fact that he was still entitled to recover pursuant to the policy language that extends coverage to persons \"occupying\" a vehicle insured under the policy because he failed to raise a genuine issue of material fact that he was \"occupying\" such a vehicle when he sustained his injuries. This appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The plaintiff claims on appeal that the court improperly concluded that there was no genuine issue of material fact as to whether (1) the policy provided underinsured coverage to him personally regardless of whether he was occupying the vehicle and (2) he was \"occupying,\" within the meaning of the policy, an insured vehicle at the time he sustained his injuries. We are not persuaded.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   We first set forth the applicable standard of review. \"In seeking summary judgment, it is the movant who has the burden of showing the nonexistence of any issue of fact.... Although the party seeking summary judgment has the burden of showing the nonexistence of any material fact ... a party opposing summary judgment must substantiate its adverse claim by showing that there is a genuine issue of material fact together with the evidence disclosing the existence of such an issue.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    Rosenfield\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    I.

In the general definition section, the policy states: \"GENERAL DEFINITIONS ....\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \"5. 'Insured auto' or 'your insured auto' means:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   a. Any auto specifically described on the declarations page ...\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \"9. 'Occupying' means in, on, entering or exiting....\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \"17. 'You,' 'your,' and 'yours' refers to the named insured shown on the declaration page.\" (Emphasis omitted.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   With respect to underinsured motorist coverage, the endorsement for uninsured and underinsured coverage provides that, \"[s]ubject to the Limits of Liability, if you pay the premium for Uninsured/Underinsured Motorist Coverage, we will pay for damages ... which an insured is legally entitled to recover from the owner or\n   operator of an uninsured auto because of bodily injury: 1. sustained by an insured; 2. caused by an accident; and 3. arising out of the ownership, maintenance or use of an uninsured auto.\" (Emphasis omitted.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The endorsement contained additional definitions as follows: \"When used in this endorsement, whether in the singular, plural or possessive:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \"1. 'Insured' means:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   \"a. if the named insured shown on the Declarations Page is a natural person:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   \"(i) you or a relative;\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   \"(ii) and person occupying your insured auto ... and\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   \"(iii) any person who is entitled to recover damages covered by this endorsement because of bodily injury sustained by a person described in (i) or (ii) above; or\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   \"b. if the named insured shown on the Declarations Page is a corporation, partnership, organization, or any other entity that is not a natural person:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   \"(i) any person occupying your insured auto ... and\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   \"(ii) any person who is entitled to recover damages covered by this endorsement because of bodily injury sustained by a person described in (i) above.\" (Emphasis omitted.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   As previously discussed, there is no genuine issue of material fact that the declarations page lists \"Wilson Roofing, LLC,\" as the named insured.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   We conclude that the court properly determined that the policy unambiguously provided that Wilson Roofing and not the plaintiff was the named insured. The use of the terms \"you\" and \"your\" in the policy does not create an ambiguity. The general definitions section of the policy states that \" 'you' 'your' and 'yours' refer to the named insured shown on the declarations page.\" The policy in the endorsement for underinsured motorist benefits provides\n   that if the name listed on the declarations page as the named insured is a corporation, partnership, organization, or any other entity that is not a natural person, then the term \"insured\" means, inter alia, \"any person occupying your insured auto ....\" Accordingly, the terms \"you\" and \"your\" in the policy refer to Wilson Roofing rather than the plaintiff personally because he is not listed as the named insured on the declarations page. Furthermore, the section of the policy that uses the terms \"you or a relative\" does not create ambiguity because the policy clearly provides that those terms apply only if the named insured on the declarations page is a natural person.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   The plaintiff contends that the language in the policy is \"not entirely clear given the phrasing and placement of pertinent definitions, including if the named insured is a natural person and 'relative' located in the general definitions section.\" He argues that the Supreme Court in\n   <em>\n    Ceci\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    National Indemnity Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"757656\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/225/165/\">\n    225 Conn. 165\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=622%20A.2d%20545\">\n    622 A.2d 545\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1993), concluded that the policy at issue in that case was ambiguous as to who was covered under the underinsured motorist coverage provision: \"According to these provisions, the defendant would pay for damages caused by an uninsured vehicle. Individuals covered by this provision included: (1) you or any family member (2) anyone else occupying a covered auto or a temporary substitute for covered auto. The policy defined Family member as a person related to you by blood, marriage or adoption who is a resident of your household, including a ward or foster child.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   The policy defined occupying as in, upon, getting in, on or off.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)

The court stated that \"[b]y inserting a family member provision in a business policy, the defendant has left the [plaintiffs] in the unenviable position of having to divine the meaning and purpose of the family member language in the context of the policy. This is precisely the problem that the rules of insurance policy construction were designed to avoid.\" Id., at 175,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=622%20A.2d%20545\">\n    622 A.2d 545\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The policy in the present case, unlike that in\n   <em>\n    Ceci\n   </em>\n   , is clear and unambiguous and provides that the named insured is Wilson Roofing and that if the named insured is not a natural person then the policy only covers individuals who are occupying the insured vehicle.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   The plaintiff also argues that the policy is ambiguous because it improperly identifies the named insured as a corporation rather than a limited liability company. The declarations page of the policy lists the name insured as \"Wilson Roofing, LLC,\" but then states that \"[t]he named insured organization type is a corporation.\" Regardless of this discrepancy, there is no genuine of material fact that the named insured is not a natural person, and, as such, is encompassed by the definition of \"insured\" that pertains to both limited liability companies and corporations. In sum, we are not persuaded by the plaintiff's first claim on appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   II\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Because it is clear that the policy covers Wilson Roofing and not the plaintiff personally, in order to be entitled to underinsured motorist coverage under the policy, the plaintiff was obligated to raise a genuine issue of material fact as to whether he was \"occupying\" an insured vehicle at the time he sustained his injuries. In that regard, the plaintiff claims that the court improperly determined that there was no genuine issue of material fact regarding whether he was \"occupying\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   the vehicle at the time of the accident. Specifically, he contends that the court improperly relied on the physical contact test used in\n   <em>\n    Gomes\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Massachusetts Bay Ins.

Id., at 435-36,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=866%20A.2d%20704\">\n    866 A.2d 704\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In that case, this court declined to adopt the proximity test reasoning, inter alia, that \"we are compelled to follow our Supreme Court's express approval of the physical contact test in\n   <em>\n    Testone\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Allstate Ins.

Co.\n   </em>\n   , supra, 435.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Moreover, the proximity test urged by the plaintiff also suffers from being far too nebulous a standard. Such a test, in our view, would be difficult to apply and is not rooted necessarily in the language of the policy or, more generally, in the plaintiff's relationship with the vehicle at the time he suffers any injury. For example, a plaintiff could park his car and then sit on a sidewalk for hours in very close proximity to his or vehicle. Under the proximity test, if the plaintiff is injured while sitting in close proximity to his or her vehicle, but hours after exiting his vehicle the insured might be entitled to coverage under the policy despite the fact that the circumstances of the accident have little to do with the insured vehicle.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   In the present case, it is undisputed that the plaintiff parked his vehicle, stepped out, walked past the rear of his vehicle, and was not in physical contact with his vehicle when he was struck by an oncoming vehicle. Therefore, the plaintiff was not \"in, on, entering or exiting\" his vehicle at the time of the accident. We conclude that the court properly granted the plaintiff's motion for summary judgment and determined that\n   there was no genuine issue of material fact regarding whether the plaintiff was occupying his vehicle at the time of the accident.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   The judgment is affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   In this opinion the other judges concurred.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-57\">\n    Although the plaintiff asserts that he is the sole member of the limited liability company, he presented no evidence regarding the corporate governance of his business.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-58\">\n    There is a factual dispute between the parties as to the make and model of the vehicle that the plaintiff drove into the parking lot of Rick's Main Roofing. The defendant asserts that the plaintiff had been driving his Chevrolet Suburban, which the parties agree is not a vehicle insured under the policy. The plaintiff contends that he had been driving a GMC Savana, which the parties agree was a vehicle covered by the policy. Because we conclude that there is no genuine issue of material fact as to whether he was \"occupying\"\n    <em>\n     any\n    </em>\n    vehicle when he sustained his injuries, the factual dispute is not relevant.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-59\">\n    The plaintiff also claims on appeal that he is the \"alter ego\" of his business and, thus, should be considered the named insured for purposes of uninsured coverage. This assertion was not pleaded in his complaint, does not appear in his objection to the defendant's motion for summary judgment and was not raised orally by the plaintiff during argument on the motion. Although the court refers briefly to the doctrine in its memorandum of decision and declines to import it from other unrelated contexts to create an ambiguity in a contract where none otherwise exists, we conclude that this claim was not distinctly raised in the trial court. \"[A]n appellate court is under no obligation to consider a claim that is not distinctly raised at the trial level.... The requirement that [a] claim be raised distinctly means that it must be so stated as to bring to the attention of the court the precise matter on which its decision is being asked.... The purpose of our preservation requirements is to ensure fair notice of a party's claims to both the trial court and opposing parties.\" (Citations omitted; emphasis omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.)\n    <em>\n     White\n    </em>\n    v.\n    <em>\n     Mazda Motor of America, Inc.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=313%20Conn.%20610\">\n     313 Conn. 610\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 619-20,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=99%20A.3d%201079\">\n     99 A.3d 1079\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (2014) ; see id., at 619,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=99%20A.3d%201079\">\n     99 A.3d 1079\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (declining to review challenge to summary judgment ruling because particular claim was not raised before trial court). Because the defendant was never given notice of the plaintiff's reliance on this doctrine, it did not have an opportunity to present competent summary judgment evidence to support an assertion that the doctrine is factually or legally inapplicable in this case. We therefore decline to review it.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-60\">\n    The plaintiff also argues that the policy is ambiguous because the declarations page lists \"Wilson Roofing, LLC,\" as the named insured, rather than the business name used by the plaintiff when he testified at his deposition, Wilson Roofing and Siding, LLC. The fact that the name of the business set forth on the declarations page does not match precisely the name of the business given by the plaintiff during his deposition does not create an ambiguity as to whether the policy covers the business or the plaintiff personally.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
