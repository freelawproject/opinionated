The present case has something to do with a part of that structure in Maryland.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   We confront here the question of whether a teacher in the Montgomery County Public School (\"MCPS\") system (or any such system likely) is protected by the Maryland State Whistleblower Protection Law, Md. Code (1993, 2015 Repl. Vol., 2016 Supp.), \u00a7\u00a7 5-301-314 (the \"WBL\") of the State Personnel and Pensions Article (\"SPP\"). Petitioner, Brian Donlon, contends that teachers employed by the county school board are embraced within the WBL because the county school board is a unit of the Executive Branch of State government.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Further, Donlon argues that Respondent, MCPS, should be estopped\n   from contending that it is not a State agency because MCPS has asserted frequently in other contexts State agency status.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In its defense, MCPS finds comfort in\n   <em>\n    Chesapeake Charter, Inc. v.

As regards judicial estoppel, MCPS observes that there is nothing in Maryland law preventing an entity from contending in litigation that it is, in one context, a State agency, but a local county governmental entity for other purposes, as long as the contexts are dissimilar substantively and each supports independently the respective assertions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Facts and Proceedings\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Because the question we confront is a purely legal one, we shall provide only\n   such factual background as needed to supply important context.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In 2012, Donlon, a teacher at Rockville's Richard Montgomery High School (\"RMHS\") in the MCPS system, discovered what he believed was an inflation by RMHS staff and administration of its Advanced Placement (\"AP\") course statistics. Donlon accused RMHS of \"awarding students credit on their report cards and transcripts when the[ ] [relevant] classes were in fact [Middle Years Program] classes and did not meet the criteria set by the College Board for AP credit.\" Donlon reported ultimately RMHS's alleged inflation of AP statistics to the County Superintendent. The Superintendent discounted Donlon's contentions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Donlon contacted a journalist at The Washington Post, informing him of RMHS's \"wrongdoing.\" The journalist interviewed members of the MCPS administration regarding Donlon's claim. As a consequence, Donlon contends that members of RMHS' faculty supervisors retaliated against him,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   in violation\n   of the WBL, for his revelations to the print media. Donlon filed with the Maryland Department of Budget and Management (\"DBM\") a WBL complaint against MCPS.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Donlon requested \"compensatory damages, punitive damages, costs and attorney's fees, and equitable relief.\"\n   <em>\n    Mont.

After a hearing, an OAH Administrative Law Judge (\"ALJ\") affirmed the DBM's decision, holding that\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   there was no jurisdiction to hear the whistleblower claim because Donlon was not an employee of the Executive Branch of State government. The ALJ noted that the State government's [E]xecutive branch contains 19 principal departments, each of which contain subordinate units, and that MCPS is not among them. The ALJ also observed that the State Board establishes policies and guidelines throughout the State, but that it is the county boards of education that employ principals and teachers. The ALJ found that Donlon submitted no evidence that he was an employee of the executive branch and that there was no employer/employee relationship between Donlon and the executive branch. Accordingly, the ALJ concluded that Donlon was not an executive branch employee, that he could not bring a whistleblower complaint pursuant to the WBL, and that DBM and the OAH did not have jurisdiction to hear the case.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <em>\n    Donlon\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12314291,12490740\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md-app/233/646/\">\n    233 Md.

If the language of the statute is unambiguous and clearly consistent with the statute's apparent purpose, our inquiry as to legislative intent ends ordinarily and we apply the statute as written, without resort to other rules of construction.

Rather, the plain language must be viewed within the context of the statutory scheme to which it belongs, considering the purpose, aim, or policy of the Legislature in enacting the statute. We presume that the Legislature intends its enactments to operate together as a consistent and harmonious body of law, and, thus, we seek to reconcile and harmonize the parts of a statute, to the extent possible consistent with the statute's object and scope.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   Where the words of a statute are ambiguous and subject to more than one reasonable interpretation, or where the words are clear and unambiguous when viewed in isolation, but become ambiguous when read as part of a larger statutory scheme, a court must resolve the ambiguity by searching for legislative intent in other indicia, including the history of the legislation or other relevant sources intrinsic and extrinsic to the legislative process.

As this goes, county boards of education must be units of the State Executive branch because clearly they are not units of the Judicial or Legislative branches. The Maryland State Board of Education (\"MSBE\"), a county board's canonical State agency overseer,\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   exercises considerable administrative influence, control, and oversight over county boards. Thus, to the extent the Court of Special Appeals relied on the holding of\n   <em>\n    Chesapeake Charter\n   </em>\n   to reject Donlon's view, it did so based on an inappropriately expansive reading of that opinion. To that end, Donlon points to\n   <em>\n    Beka Indus., Inc. v. Worcester County Bd. of Educ.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3698376\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/419/194/#p217\">\n    419 Md. 194\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 217,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3698376\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/419/194/#p217\">\n    18 A.3d 890\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 904 (2011), which explained that\n   <em>\n    Chesapeake Charter's\n   </em>\n   holding was \"a narrow one.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Donlon urges upon us that the frequency of Maryland cases holding county school boards to be agents of the State should compel us to read the WBL to extend protection to public school teachers. Donlon insists, at the very least, that the WBL is ambiguous as to its coverage in this regard. Thus, recourse to the canon of statutory interpretation of\n   <em>\n    in pari materia\n   </em>\n   is necessary to pierce the enigma, by harmonizing the WBL with the Public School Employee Whistleblower Protection Act (the \"PSEWPA\"), Md. Code (2017, 2018 Repl. Vol.), \u00a7\u00a7 6-901-906 of the Education Article (\"Educ.\") (effective 1 October 2017), which extends expressly whistleblower protection to \"any individual who is employed by a public school employer or an individual of equivalent status in Baltimore City.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   MCPS, in response, directs our attention to\n   <em>\n    Phillips\n   </em>\n   , contending that \"an entity may qualify as a state agency for some purposes while being classified as a local agency for other purposes.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3690363\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/413/606/#p632\">\n    413 Md. at 632\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3690363,3690427\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/994/411/\">\n    994 A.2d at 427\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . MCPS concedes that this Court has stated frequently that county boards of education are State agencies. These occasions, however, are characterized by MCPS as either dictum or occur in the limited context of asserting Eleventh Amendment/sovereign immunity defenses. As MCPS's argument goes, although a county school board may invoke its State-delegated sovereign function in appropriate circumstances, some operations are local predominately in structure and/or character, such that it is impossible to classify the board for all purposes as a State entity.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Chesapeake Charter\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"144570\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/358/129/\">\n    358 Md. at 137-40\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"144570\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/358/129/\">\n    747 A.2d at 629-31\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Furthermore, MCPS marshals as authorities the PSEWPA,\n   <em>\n    Chesapeake Charter\n   </em>\n   , and published opinions of the MSBE and the Maryland Attorney General's Office confirming the view that public school employees, like Donlon, are not extended WBL protection. The PSEWPA excludes\n   State employees from its definition of \"public school employee.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Educ. \u00a7 6-901 (b)(2) (\"Public school employee\" does not include a State employee.). Thus, if we were to hold county school boards to\n   be State agents, then by PSEWPA definition, they are not protected \"Public School Employees.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   MCPS notes that, at the same time Donlon invokes the canon of\n   <em>\n    in pari materia\n   </em>\n   and implores this Court to meld the WBL with the PSEWPA, he offers no legal analysis for how the Court can blend harmoniously the two statutes to extend WBL coverage to public school teachers.

A county school teacher does not fall within any of these categories.

Woolums, Esq., a representative from MABE,\n   <footnotemark>\n    30\n   </footnotemark>\n   testified in opposition to H.B. 1145 stating:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-138\">\n   why [ ] single out a public school employees for a standalone whistleblower protection act? The questions that flow from that focuses on the fact that this law does and does not track the [WBL], which has what we view to be tighter and more well-defined terms and procedures relative to reporting to the Attorney General's Office in certain instances and a number of other instances. [ ]\n   <em>\n    That leads to questions about why wouldn't the inclination be to add school employees or other public employees in the State to the\n   </em>\n   [\n   <em>\n    WBL\n   </em>\n   ]\n   <em>\n    to broaden the scope of that existing statute.\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-139\">\n   (emphasis added). Mr. Woolums maintained that the PSEWPA was unnecessary because the General Assembly need only amend the WBL to add public school employees to its coverage. Implicit in this view, the WBL did not extend protection to public school teachers in its un-amended form.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-140\">\n   Delegate Tarlau, in response to Mr. Woolums' testimony, noted that the proposed PSEWPA is \"modeled after the [Maryland State Whistleblower Act for Healthcare Employees] ... [The PSEWPA] covers people who are also not covered by the [Collective Bargaining Agreement rules].\" Before the Senate Committee on Finance, Delegate Tarlau testified that the proposed PSEWPA \"gives protection for public school employees. Maryland has also a State whistleblower law for all State employees\n   <em>\n    but not\n   </em>\n   public school employees.\" Mr. Woolums withdrew his opposition to the proposed PSEWPA before testimony was taken before the Senate Committee on Finance. Moreover, the fiscal and policy note to H.B. 1145 states that the current status of Maryland law \"affords licensed or certified health care employees\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State employees similar whistleblower protections\n   </em>\n   .\" (emphasis added). The note makes no mention of any existing whistleblower protection laws applicable to public school teachers or employees.

Moreover, Donlon urges that the Court of Special Appeals erred in applying a rigid set of elements to determine whether judicial estoppel should apply.
