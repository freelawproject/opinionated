Maryland Rule 5-609 (\" Rule 5-609\" or \"the Rule\") permits the admission of prior convictions for impeachment purposes, so long as the conviction is within the class of convictions concerning credibility, 15 years have not elapsed since the conviction and\n   the probative value of the conviction outweighs its prejudicial effect. The Rule embodies our respect for these interests and serves as the starting point from which all trial judges must begin in order to strike the appropriate balance. Our decision today reconciles the competing interests between a defendant's constitutional right to testify and the State's less-protected right to cross-examine a defendant for impeachment purposes. We are specifically called upon to examine whether the trial judge struck the appropriate balance in Carl Burnside's (\"Petitioner\" or \"Mr. Burnside\") trial, in which Mr. Burnside was convicted for possession with intent to distribute a controlled dangerous substance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    Facts\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The facts presented at trial are as follows. On April 4, 2016, shortly after midnight, Deputy Kyle Snodderly stopped a vehicle operating with only one illuminated headlight in Hagerstown,\n   Washington County, Maryland. There were two individuals in the vehicle, the driver, Nicholas Knight, and Petitioner, Carl Burnside, who sat in the front passenger seat. Mr. Knight produced a driver's license that authorized him to drive only to and from his place employment. Deputy Snodderly testified that Petitioner produced identification and informed Deputy Snodderly that he may have had outstanding traffic warrants. The vehicle was registered to a Joey Jones in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Petitioner informed the deputy that Mr. Jones was his cousin, and Mr. Knight informed Deputy Snodderly that he was helping Mr. Burnside to relocate from Philadelphia to Hagerstown, Maryland.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   With regard to the initial traffic stop, Deputy Snodderly testified that he became suspicious\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   about the occupants in the vehicle because he did not observe any items in the vehicle-other than a dirty fish tank-that were consistent with Mr. Knight's statement that he was helping Petitioner move. Deputy Snodderly's warrant check confirmed that Petitioner had an outstanding warrant for driving without a license. Upon confirmation, Deputy Snodderly called for backup and placed Petitioner in custody and searched Petitioner incident to the arrest. Shortly thereafter, Deputy Jasen Logsdon arrived on the scene as backup. The search of Mr. Burnside produced $5,169.69 cash in mostly $20 bills, and a cell phone. Despite Mr. Burnside's statement that some of the cash was for his rent, and some of it was money he won at a casino,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Deputy Logsdon requested a K-9 unit to conduct a \"free air sniff\" of the vehicle because of the large amount of cash recovered from Petitioner, which apparently is typical of \"people that partake in drug sales [and] distribution.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Officer Curtis Kelley arrived on the scene with his K-9 partner, Jackie. Jackie indicated a positive alert for a controlled dangerous substance near the trunk of the car. Mr. Knight was asked to step out of the vehicle upon Jackie's positive alert. Mr. Burnside also informed one of the officers that there was a marijuana cigarette in the ashtray of the vehicle. The vehicle search recovered the partially smoked marijuana cigarette, three hypodermic syringes associated with heroin usage, a metal spoon with \"white powdery residue on the bowl and black burn marks on the bottom side,\" a large quantity of Ziploc baggies, each containing heroin or\n   cocaine, a large quantity of empty Ziploc baggies, a digital scale with heroin residue on it, a duffle bag, and a shower bag containing toiletries.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Deputy Logsdon testified that he searched Mr. Knight twice; the first search revealed nothing and the second search revealed an orange syringe cap.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Mr. Knight was called as a State witness in Mr. Burnside's criminal proceedings. On direct examination, Mr. Knight testified that he was charged with intent to distribute heroin and crack cocaine, with possession of controlled paraphernalia, and for driving on a restricted license. He testified that he entered a plea agreement with the State in which he pled guilty to possession of controlled paraphernalia,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , the syringes recovered from the vehicle, in exchange for \"pre-trial sentencing and probation.\" He testified that he was addicted to drugs and that he was participating in a court-ordered drug rehabilitation program. On cross-examination, he testified that his possession with intent to distribute charges were dropped in exchange for his testimony against Mr. Burnside and that his sentencing for the possession of paraphernalia was delayed until after Mr. Burnside's trial. Mr. Knight explained that the delayed sentencing would allow the State to observe and evaluate his testimony against Mr. Burnside. When asked on cross-examination if he had ever sold heroin or crack cocaine,\n   he replied in the negative. Finally, when defense counsel asked Mr. Knight if he knew Jason Marshall, William Bucklew, or Scott Dorman, Mr. Knight denied knowing all three individuals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The Defense presented three witnesses: Jason Marshall, William Bucklew, and Scott Dorman. Each of the individuals testified to purchasing drugs from Mr. Knight. Mr. Marshall testified that he purchased heroin from Mr. Knight two years before the time of his testimony, and that a friend of his purchased drugs from Mr. Knight. Mr. Bucklew testified that he purchased heroin from Mr. Knight in February or March 2016. Mr. Dorman testified that he purchased heroin and what he thought to be crack cocaine from Knight six to seven months before the time of his testimony. Mr. Burnside did not testify in his defense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <em>\n    Mr. Burnside's Theory of Defense\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   For a trial judge to conduct an appropriate balancing test, he or she must have some knowledge regarding the nature of a defendant's testimony, which is usually illuminated by the defendant's theory of defense. The State contends that Petitioner's theory of the case was too ambiguous for the trial judge to conduct an informed balancing test prior to Petitioner's testimony. The record suggests that the Defense's theory centered around the fact that there was another individual, Mr. Nicholas Knight, in the vehicle with Petitioner, and that Mr. Knight could have been in actual or constructive possession of the drugs recovered from the vehicle. During the opening statement the Defense encouraged the jury to\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   pay attention to the details[ ].... because once Nicholas Knight was taken into custody himself, and they recovered a cell phone from him as well [as] [ ] forty-five dollars in cash.... [and] three caps to the syringes that were found right next to him, the driver's side and the console.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Defense counsel explained to the jury that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   [T]he evidence ... will show that Mr. Knight had possession of the key to the\n   car. Mr. Knight ... [was] the one who\n   [was] driving the vehicle in violation of the law. The evidence will also show that behind the closed passenger compartment is [ ] a black hide-away-key.... [but] [t]here is no such thing as a driver's side passenger compartment .... [t]here is only one glovebox in the car. It's always in front of the passenger.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   The evidence will show that Mr. Knight was charged with the exact same offenses .... [b]ut he was able to avoid felony convictions and significant prison time by simply walking into the courtroom ... [and] point[ing] the finger at [Mr. Burnside]. By cutting a deal ... he gets to walk out that door and go home.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Later, during a bench conference regarding the admission of a receipt into evidence, defense counsel objected to its admission partly \"because obviously the[ ] central issue here for the jury to decide is [ ] whose drugs are they.\" To which the Court replied, \"Right.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   When viewed collectively, the defense attorney's comments during opening statement and the bench conference, and the defendant's three witnesses, outline the theory of the defense in this case. The crux of the defense theory was to cast reasonable doubt on Mr. Burnside's connection to the drugs and to suggest that Mr. Knight could have possessed the drugs with the intent to distribute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <em>\n    Mr. Burnside's Decision to Not Testify\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   After Marshall, Bucklew, and Dorman testified, defense counsel advised Mr. Burnside, out of the hearing of the jury, of his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination and informed him that because he had a prior conviction for possession with intent to distribute a controlled dangerous substance,\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   she would ask the court to conduct a balancing test\n   \"to determine whether or not the State would be allowed to use [ ] [that] prior conviction against [him].\" When asked if he wished to testify in light of the potential impeachment, Mr. Burnside replied:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   [BURNSIDE]: I just know that if my past is going to be used against me, then I would not like to be testifying because it would be bias, it would be biased [sic] me to the charges I'm facing right now.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   [DEFENSE COUNSEL]: You are saying you would be afraid you would be prejudiced?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   [BURNSIDE]: Yes\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   [DEFENSE COUNSEL]: I believe he has a conviction your Honor. The only thing is the State has served us with mandatory minimum notice as well as subsequent offender notice and they have attached a certified docket entry for possession with intent. It does not say what substance it is, [ ] but there is a conviction for that offense. And I can't recall if it was 2011 or 2012 when it occurred.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   [BURNSIDE]: 2012.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   [DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Okay. Okay. And I would just ask this Court, if-if the [c]ourt would conduct a balancing test. I would agree that it is [ ] within the purview of crimes that are involving dishonesty.... I would agree that it's been for the past 15 years. But part three of that test, according to\n   <em>\n    Jackson\n   </em>\n   would be whether or not it would be more prejudicial than it would be probative. We would argue that [ ] in\n   this instance with a man who is on trial for possessing with intent to distribute, my fear would be that if the [c]ourt were to allow that, the State to impeach him with a prior conviction that the jury would base their decision solely on his previous conviction and not based upon the evidence presented here today.\n   [THE STATE]: Your honor, I do have the case that uh (inaudible) if he takes the stand and he opens the door than he would be subject to impeachment....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   [THE COURT]: That's-It is a balancing test but I don't think I need to make the balancing decision before he testifies. I think it's his decision whether he wants to testify or doesn't want to testify. If he takes the stand and the State attempts to bring up his prior conviction then we will have a determination at that time, but I'm not going to preliminarily make that decision.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   [BURNSIDE]: I choose to exercise my Fifth Amendment right to remain silent and not testify due to his Honor's previous objections for anything I say on our [sic] behalf.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   [DEFENSE COUNSEL]: So, it is your decision not to testify.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   [BURNSIDE]: Yes, I don't want to testify. I won't get no [sic] justice.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   The defense rested its case after Mr. Burnside elected not to testify. On September 16, 2016, after the jury heard testimony from the three arresting officers, a drug distribution expert, a controlled dangerous substances expert, three defense witnesses, and reviewed physical evidence including photos of the confiscated drugs, the jury convicted Mr. Burnside of possession with intent to distribute heroin and possession of cocaine. He was sentenced to 15 years, with the first 10 to be served without the possibility of parole. The jury acquitted him of possession with intent to distribute cocaine, and the State filed a nolle prosequi\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   to the charge of possession of drug paraphernalia.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <strong>\n    Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Mr. Burnside noted a timely appeal to the Court of Special Appeals raising five issues for review with only one relevant to\n   our holding today.\n   <em>\n    Burnside v.

We agree with Mr. Burnside that defense counsel sought an\n   advanced ruling regarding the admissibility of the prior conviction and that the decision was decided by the trial court when it denied defense counsel's request stating, \"If he takes the stand and the State attempts to bring up his prior conviction then we will have a determination at that time, but I'm not going to\n   <em>\n    preliminarily\n   </em>\n   make that decision.\" Therefore, the issue is preserved for our review.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Maryland Rule 8-131 (\"Ordinarily, the appellate court will not decide any other issue unless it plainly appears by the record to have been raised in or decided by the trial court.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Dallas\n   </em>\n   , we recognized that there are circumstances where \"fairness to the defendant augurs in favor of the trial court's ruling on the motion before the defendant elects whether to testify or remain silent.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3690885\" index=\"126\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/413/569/#p588\">\n    413 Md. at 586\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3690885\" index=\"127\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/413/569/#p588\">\n    993 A.2d at 665\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The facts in the instant case demonstrate such a circumstance. Mr. Burnside's theory of defense was clear and established at the outset of the trial, and Mr. Burnside, therefore, had presented to the trial court \"other means\" of determining how he would likely testify.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3690885\" index=\"128\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/413/569/#p588\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   For example, all three of the defense witnesses testified that they had purchased drugs from Mr. Knight and one of the witnesses knew of another individual who had purchased drugs from Mr. Knight as well. Additionally, defense counsel made it clear to the trial judge that the jury's focus was to determine \"whose drugs they are,\" to which the trial judge agreed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   In its brief, the State contends that unlike the defendant in\n   <em>\n    Dallas\n   </em>\n   , Mr. Burnside's \"theory of the case was not clear.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   This contention is completely incongruent with what occurred at trial. During closing argument, the State seems to have understood the theory of the defense as one in which the defense \"point[s] the finger ... [at] Mr. Knight,\" and refers to the case as a \"whodunit.\" In an attempt to distinguish this case from that of\n   <em>\n    Dallas\n   </em>\n   , the State quotes from Chief Judge Bell's concurring and dissenting opinion in\n   <em>\n    Dallas\n   </em>\n   . We find the quote useful, but for a different reason. We observe that in the instant case,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-77\">\n   [i]t is clear that the trial court had enough information at its disposal to conduct the balancing test and make an informed ruling.

Moreover, Petitioner was explicit as to his reason not to testify; he did not want to be judged in this case by his past conviction, because to do so would be prejudicial. In other words, he did not want to risk being prejudiced by his prior conviction and believed that making an uninformed election to testify was a risk in and of itself, one that he was not willing to take.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   We pointed out in\n   <em>\n    Dallas\n   </em>\n   that there are situations where the trial \"court need not hear the defendant's testimony to know how to rule on a motion to exclude ... proposed impeachment evidence.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3690885\" index=\"134\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/413/569/#p588\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3690885\" index=\"134\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/413/569/#p588\">\n    at 586\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3690885\" index=\"135\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/413/569/#p588\">\n    993 A.2d at 665\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The trial judge acknowledged that determining the admissibility of Mr. Burnside's prior conviction involved a \"balancing test,\" but did not believe that he needed to \"make the balancing decision before [Mr. Burnside] testified.\" The trial judge stated that Mr. Burnside had to make the \"decision\n   whether he want[ed] to testify or [did not] want to testify.

Given the facts developed in this record, it was an abuse of discretion to defer ruling on the motion until after the defendant testified. Furthermore, the trial judge's statement ignores what we acknowledged in\n   <em>\n    Dallas\n   </em>\n   : that a trial court \"should, when feasible, make reasonable efforts to accommodate a defendant by ruling in advance on the admissibility of a criminal record so that [the defendant] can make an\n   <em>\n    informed\n   </em>\n   decision whether or not to testify.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 585,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3690885\" index=\"141\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/413/569/#p588\">\n    993 A.2d at 664\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added) (quoting\n   <em>\n    United States v.

When asked if he elected to testify, Mr. Burnside stated, \"I choose to exercise my Fifth Amendment right to remain silent and not testify due to his Honor's previous objections for anything I say on our behalf\n   <sup>\n    [\n   </sup>\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   <sup>\n    ]\n   </sup>\n   ....

The trial judge's statement that he was not going to preliminarily make a decision would lead a reasonable mind to conclude, just as it led Mr. Burnside's counsel to conclude, that the trial judge's declination was final and the offering of a proffer or any additional information to inform a pre-election balancing test would have been futile.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   It is our view that the trial court had enough information to reasonably conduct a balancing test prior to Mr. Burnside's election whether to testify. It had adequate means of assessing how Mr. Burnside would likely testify, given the clear theory of the defense. Additionally, the trial court was aware that Mr. Burnside felt prejudiced by the delay in the ruling.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Dallas\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3690885\" index=\"147\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/413/569/#p588\">\n    413 Md. at 588\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3690885\" index=\"148\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/413/569/#p588\">\n    993 A.2d at 666\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (where this Court observed that \"Petitioner did not complain at the time that the court's delay chilled his right to make an election.

The court was aware of, first, a defendant's constitutional right to testify. Second, the court had a clear understanding that\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-87\">\n   [w]here the crime for which the defendant is on trial is identical or similar to the crime for which he has been previously convicted the danger is greater, as the jury may conclude that because he did it before he most likely has done it again.

That the\n   <em>\n    Dallas\n   </em>\n   court enumerated three\n   such scenarios when the trial court should rule on such a motion prior to the defendant's testimony did not confine the realm of possible scenarios to those enumerated. The facts of this case present one such scenario that was not among the enumerated list in\n   <em>\n    Dallas\n   </em>\n   . With Mr. Burnside having been previously convicted of a similar crime for which he stood trial and with his theory of defense clear, the trial judge did not need to wait to hear Mr. Burnside's testimony before ruling on the Rule 5-609 motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   Our opinion today in no way quells the possibility that there are circumstances in which the trial judge may appropriately choose to defer conducting the balancing test until after the defendant testifies. In the rare instance when a judge defers his ruling on the defendant's Rule 5-609 motion, before deferring the ruling, the trial judge should first assess all reasonable efforts to accommodate a defendant by making an advance ruling on the admissibility of a defendant's criminal record to enable the defendant to make an informed decision whether to testify or not.

Therefore, I concur on this issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   I write separately because I respectfully disagree with the Majority's assessment that the circumstances of this case required the trial judge to rule on the admissibility of the prior conviction impeachment evidence by conducting a Rule 5-609 balancing test before the defendant elected to testify.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   The Majority's holding improperly expands the circumstances for conducting an\n   <em>\n    in limine\n   </em>\n   balancing test and effectively requires a trial judge to\n   <em>\n    sua sponte\n   </em>\n   request a proffer of defendant's testimony or to speculate about the substance of the defendant's ungiven testimony based on a general theory of the case in order to properly exercise his or her discretion.

The\n   <em>\n    Dallas\n   </em>\n   Court, therefore recognized certain circumstances in which a trial judge should conduct a Md. Rule 5-609 balancing test before the defendant elects to testify.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3690885\" index=\"191\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/413/569/#p588\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   These circumstances include: (1) when the\n   trial court determines that the prior convictions are inadmissible under Md. Rule 5-609(a)(1) or (b); (2) when the trial judge concludes that the impeachment evidence is so prejudicial that the defendant's testimony would not alter the trial judge's ruling; (3) when a party files a motion\n   <em>\n    in limine\n   </em>\n   requesting the court to conduct the balancing test before an election to testify supplemented with admissions during opening statements, which provided the trial judge with sufficient information as to how the defendant would likely testify; or (4) when a party files a motion\n   <em>\n    in limine\n   </em>\n   requesting the court to conduct the balancing test before an election to testify supplemented with a proffer of the defendant's testimony, providing the trial judge with sufficient information regarding the defendant's testimony.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   The differences between this case and the circumstances identified in\n   <em>\n    Dallas\n   </em>\n   are several and significant. First, Mr. Burnside's prior conviction was not inadmissible under Maryland Rule 5-609(a)(1) or (b). Under Maryland Rule 5-609(a)(1), to be admissible, a witness's prior conviction must be for \"an\n   infamous crime or other crime relevant to the witness's credibility[.]\" All felonies are infamous crimes.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Taylor v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3491683\" index=\"192\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/407/137/#p154\">\n    407 Md. 137\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 154,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3491683\" index=\"193\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/407/137/#p154\">\n    963 A.2d 197\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2009). Here, Mr. Burnside's prior conviction was for possession of a controlled dangerous substance with the intent to distribute. Although Mr. Burnside's counsel did not state which controlled dangerous substance Mr. Burnside's prior conviction was for, possession of any controlled dangerous substance with the intent to distribute is a felony.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Md. Code Ann., Crim. Law (2002, 2012 Repl. Vol.) \u00a7\u00a7 5-607(a), 5-608(a), 5-608.1(b), 5-609(a). Thus, Mr. Burnside's prior conviction was not inadmissible under Maryland Rule 5-609(a)(1). Additionally, Mr. Burnside's prior conviction occurred in 2012, and was thus well within the fifteen-year time limitation under Maryland Rule 5-609(b).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   The instant circumstances also do not give rise to the conclusion that the danger of unfair prejudice substantially outweighed the probative value of Mr. Burnside's prior conviction regardless of how he testified. Had Mr. Burnside elected to testify, his credibility would have been a crucial matter for the jury to determine, and evidence that he was a convicted felon would have been a highly probative piece of impeachment evidence. To be sure, evidence that Mr. Burnside had been convicted of the same type of crime for which he was on trial,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , possession of a controlled dangerous substance with the intent to distribute, could have caused a danger of unfair prejudice. This case was not, however, a scenario in which it was immediately clear that the danger of unfair prejudice would \"far outweigh[ the] probative value[,]\" as would be the case where a defendant who is on trial for shoplifting has a prior conviction for rape.\n   <em>\n    Dallas\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3690885\" index=\"194\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/413/569/#p588\">\n    413 Md. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   586 &amp; n.10,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3690885\" index=\"195\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/413/569/#p588\">\n    993 A.2d 655\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   Furthermore, the defendant in the case\n   <em>\n    sub judice\n   </em>\n   did not file a pre-trial motion\n   <em>\n    in limine\n   </em>\n   requesting the trial judge conduct a balancing test under Md.

Instead, the defense counsel for Mr. Burnside first asked the trial judge to exclude the prior conviction impeachment evidence at the exact same time when counsel\n   was qualifying his client on his fifth amendment right to testify. As such, the trial judge first became aware of a possible Rule 5-609 balancing test immediately before the defendant was deciding whether or not to take the stand. Moreover, there is nothing in the record in the case\n   <em>\n    sub judice\n   </em>\n   that shows the trial court heard \"admissions\" during the defense's opening statement.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3690885\" index=\"198\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/413/569/#p588\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3690885\" index=\"198\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/413/569/#p588\">\n    at 585-86\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3690885\" index=\"199\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/413/569/#p588\">\n    993 A.2d 655\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 666-67 (\"For example, a court may hear admissions that the defense makes during the defense's opening statement ...\").\n   Counsel for Mr. Burnside also did not request the trial court accept a proffer of the defendant's testimony for purposes of conducting a Md. Rule 5-609 balancing test before Mr. Burnside elected whether or not to testify. This departs far from the third and fourth circumstances identified in\n   <em>\n    Dallas\n   </em>\n   , which anticipated that a trial judge would be viewing the whole trial, including opening statement and any proffer, through the lens of a Md.

During Mr. Burnside's opening statement, aside from mentioning that the State charged Nicholas Vincent Knight (the Toyota's driver) with the same crimes as Mr. Burnside, his counsel did not state or imply that Mr. Knight was a drug dealer. During Mr. Knight's cross-examination, Mr. Burnside's counsel asked him whether he had ever sold heroin or cocaine, and whether he knew Mr. Burnside's three witnesses: Jason Tyler Marshall, William Joseph Bucklew, and Scott Dorman. In each instance, Mr. Knight answered in the negative. Mr. Marshall testified that he had bought heroin, and possibly cocaine, from Mr. Knight; Mr. Bucklew testified that he had bought heroin from Mr. Knight; and Mr. Dorman testified that he had bought heroin and cocaine from Mr. Knight.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   Under these circumstances, contrary to Mr. Burnside's contention, it was not \"very [ ] easy to predict\" that he would have testified that Mr. Knight was a drug dealer, and that the cocaine and heroin in the Toyota belonged to Mr. Knight. It would have been entirely consistent with Mr. Burnside's opening\n   statement, as well as his witnesses' testimony, for him to simply testify that he did not know who owned the cocaine and heroin, without testifying that Mr. Knight was a drug dealer. Alternatively, Mr. Burnside could have conceded that the cocaine and heroin belonged to him, but denied that he intended to distribute them.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3690885\" index=\"203\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/413/569/#p588\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3690885\" index=\"203\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/413/569/#p588\">\n    at 573\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3690885\" index=\"204\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/413/569/#p588\">\n    993 A.2d 655\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 666-67 (During the defendant's opening statement, his counsel acknowledged that he possessed cocaine and marijuana, but denied that he intended to distribute the cocaine.).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   In sum, regardless of whether the trial judge expressly observed as much, Mr. Burnside could have testified to any number of defense theories, including: (1) that Mr. Knight was a drug dealer who owned the cocaine and heroin; (2) that Mr. Burnside did not know who owned the cocaine and heroin; or (3) that Mr. Burnside owned, but did not intend to distribute, the cocaine and heroin.

There is no requirement that the trial court's exercise of discretion be detailed for the record, so long as the record reflects that the discretion was in fact exercised.\"). Here, the trial judge specifically announced, \"It is a balancing test but I don't think I need to make the balancing decision before he testifies ... I'm not going to preliminarily make that decision,\" indicating that he was using\n   his discretion to defer conducting a Md. Rule 5-609 balancing test in order to hear the defendant's proffered testimony.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   Even if the Majority's intention is to add to the circumstances weighing in favor of requiring a Md. Rule 5-609 balancing test before a defendant's election to testify that we identified in\n   <em>\n    Dallas\n   </em>\n   , then this raises crucial concerns about the Majority's apparent requirement for the trial court to act\n   <em>\n    sua sponte\n   </em>\n   . At no point did Mr. Burnside's counsel request that the trial judge hear a proffer of the defendant's testimony, which would likely have provided the trial court with sufficient information to conduct the balancing test prior to Mr. Burnside's election. Furthermore, neither the defense counsel nor the State requested that the trial judge hold a hearing to consider the defendant's request to conduct a Rule 5-609 balancing test before Mr. Burnside took the stand in his own defense. Therefore, it is unclear under the Majority's reasoning whether a defense attorney even has to request a pretrial ruling as to the admissibility of impeachment evidence under Md. Rule 5-609 or whether the trial court is required to act\n   <em>\n    sua sponte\n   </em>\n   where it \"ha[s] enough information to reasonably conduct a balancing test[.]\" Maj. Op. at 681, 188 A.3d at 895. Under the Majority's reasoning, there may never be a set of circumstances in which a trial judge will feel confident in deferring a\n   Md. Rule 5-609 balancing test until after the defendant has testified. However, this directly conflicts with this Court's holding in\n   <em>\n    Dallas\n   </em>\n   : \"the trial court may deem it necessary in a given case to defer ruling on the admission (or exclusion) of prior crimes impeachment evidence until after the court hears the defendant's testimony.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 585,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3690885\" index=\"219\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/413/569/#p588\">\n    993 A.2d 655\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 666-67.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   If any of the factual circumstances identified in\n   <em>\n    Dallas\n   </em>\n   had occurred in the case below, the Majority's reasoning might be correct. However, by simply holding that the trial judge abused his discretion by waiting to conduct the balancing test given the \"facts and circumstances of Mr. Burnside's case,\" this Court is effectively requiring the trial judge to\n   <em>\n    sua sponte\n   </em>\n   request a proffer of the defendant's testimony or otherwise make a determination as to admissibility of evidence under Md. Rule 5-609 without so much as a request to do so from\n   the defendant. Maj. Op. at 681-82, 188 A.3d at 895. Maryland Courts have previously recognized that there must be sufficient information to trigger a trial judge's\n   <em>\n    sua sponte\n   </em>\n   duty, especially because \"[i]t is not for trial judges,\n   <em>\n    sua sponte,\n   </em>\n   to second-guess trial tactics, however ill-advised they might seem to the judge.\"\n   <em>\n    Nelson v.

In\n    <em>\n     Dallas\n    </em>\n    , the trial judge's on the record statement regarding the uncertainty of the defendant's testimony is what served as the impetus for the\n    <em>\n     Dallas\n    </em>\n    court's presumption \"that the trial court, not unreasonably envisioned that, had Petitioner taken the stand, he might not have confined his testimony\" to the theory of defense established in his counsel's opening statement.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3690885\" index=\"246\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/413/569/#p588\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3690885\" index=\"246\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/413/569/#p588\">\n     at 587\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3690885\" index=\"247\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/413/569/#p588\">\n     993 A.2d at 665\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"11\">\n   <p id=\"p-134\">\n    Although Mr. Burnside referred to the trial court's trial decisions as objections, when reviewing the record, it becomes apparent that Mr. Burnside was referring to the trial court's overruling of defense counsel's objections to the State's introduction of pending criminal charges during the impeachment of the Defense's witnesses. Given the trial court's failure to comply with Maryland Rule 5-608(b) -that on which the Court of Special Appeals appropriately remarked as erroneous-it is not surprising that Mr. Burnside believed that he would not receive justice if he elected to testify.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"12\">\n   <p id=\"p-135\">\n    If the trial judge had expounded on his reason for the delay and chose to delay his ruling due to a lack of clarity regarding the theory of the defense, Mr. Burnside's defense counsel certainly could have offered a proffer to inform the trial judge's balancing test. In\n    <em>\n     Dallas\n    </em>\n    we stated that:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-136\">\n    [T]he best practice is for trial judges to accept a proffer of the defendant's testimony and make an\n    <em>\n     in limine\n    </em>\n    ruling based on it. The ruling should be accompanied by an express caution to the defendant that, if the defendant's direct testimony departs from the proffer in a way that changes the probative/prejudice balance scrutiny required by Rule 5-609(a), then a final ruling on the admissibility of the impeachment evidence might well be different.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-137\">\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3690885\" index=\"248\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/413/569/#p588\">\n     413 Md. 569\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 586,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3690885\" index=\"249\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/413/569/#p588\">\n     993 A.2d 655\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 665 n. 11. We are in no way suggesting that trial courts should\n    <em>\n     sua sponte\n    </em>\n    request proffers; instead, we are merely highlighting that if a trial court expresses uncertainty as the reason for the delay, the defendant is put on notice that a proffer may resolve the uncertainty. Whether the defense's trial tactics involves the offer of a proffer is for the defense to decide, not for a trial judge to\n    <em>\n     sua sponte\n    </em>\n    request.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
