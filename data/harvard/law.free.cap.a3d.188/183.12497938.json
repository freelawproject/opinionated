In this evolving area of Fourth Amendment jurisprudence, we conclude that the operator consented to the blood test, and we affirm the denial of the motion to suppress.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   I. BACKGROUND\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   [\u00b6 2] Lyanne LeMeunier-Fitzgerald appeals from a judgment of conviction entered by the trial court (Kennebec County,\n   <em>\n    Mullen, J.\n   </em>\n   ) upon her conditional guilty plea to charges of operating under the influence (Class C), 29-A M.R.S. \u00a7 2411(1-A)(B)(2), (5)(C) (2017), and operating beyond a license condition or restriction (Class E), 29-A M.R.S. \u00a7 1251(1)(B) (2017), entered after the court (\n   <em>\n    Marden, J.\n   </em>\n   ) denied her motion to suppress the results of a blood test for alcohol. She challenges\n   the court's determination that she voluntarily consented to the blood test after she was warned by the arresting officer that there were potential consequences if she refused to consent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   [\u00b6 3] The operative facts, most of which were found upon the parties' stipulation and none of which are disputed on appeal, are as follows. On December 21, 2015, an Augusta police officer suspected that LeMeunier-Fitzgerald was operating under the influence of an intoxicant after observing her in a supermarket parking lot. Her vehicle was partially pulled out of a parking space, her eyes were glassy, and she smelled of alcohol. When the officer approached and questioned her, she grabbed a bottle of pills and poured them into her mouth. The officer placed her in handcuffs and called for a rescue team. When the rescue team arrived, the handcuffs were removed and LeMeunier-Fitzgerald was taken to the hospital.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   [\u00b6 4] After hospital personnel had attended to LeMeunier-Fitzgerald and had placed her in a room, the officer met with her. The officer informed her that he suspected that she had been attempting to operate a motor vehicle while under the influence of intoxicants, and he read Maine's \"implied consent\" warnings to her verbatim from a form provided by the Secretary of State's Bureau of Motor Vehicles.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   29-A M.R.S. \u00a7 2521 (2017). Included was the warning, \"If you are convicted of operating while under the influence of intoxicating liquor or drugs, your failure to submit to a chemical test will be considered an aggravating factor at sentencing which in addition to other penalties, will subject you to a mandatory minimum period of incarceration.\" LeMeunier-Fitzgerald agreed to submit to the blood test, and a blood sample was taken from her without a warrant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   [\u00b6 5] LeMeunier-Fitzgerald was charged by complaint, and she was later indicted, for operating under the influence (Class C), 29-A M.R.S. \u00a7 2411(1-A)(B)(2), and operating beyond a license condition or restriction (Class E), 29-A M.R.S. \u00a7 1251(1)(B). She moved to suppress the blood test results as having been procured without a warrant and without voluntary consent, in violation of the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution. The court held a hearing on the motion to suppress on July 26, 2016. The parties stipulated that (1) the officer had probable cause to believe that LeMeunier-Fitzgerald was operating while under the influence of an intoxicant, (2) her blood was drawn without a search warrant, and (3) there were no exigent circumstances. The court then heard brief testimony from the officer who had taken LeMeunier-Fitzgerald into custody. For purposes of the motion, that testimony was not disputed by LeMeunier-Fitzgerald.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   [\u00b6 6] The court denied the motion to suppress, reasoning that, unlike the situation that the United States Supreme Court recently addressed in\n   <em>\n    Birchfield v. North Dakota\n   </em>\n   , LeMeunier-Fitzgerald did not submit to the blood testing \"on pain of committing a criminal offense.\" 579 U.S. ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12597986\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/2160/#p2186\">\n    136 S.Ct. 2160\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 2186,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12597986\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/2160/#p2186\">\n    195 L.Ed.2d 560\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2016). The court concluded that the heightened minimum penalties, including a mandatory minimum period of incarceration, that may be imposed on a person who refuses to submit to testing if convicted of OUI were not equivalent to an independent criminal offense for refusal as described in\n   <em>\n    Birchfield.\n   </em>\n   579 U.S. at ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12597986\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/2160/#p2186\">\n    136 S.Ct. at 2169-70, 2186\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   [\u00b6 7] LeMeunier-Fitzgerald entered a conditional guilty plea, preserving her right to appeal from the ruling on the motion to suppress, and the court (\n   <em>\n    Mullen, J.\n   </em>\n   ) sentenced her to three years in prison,\n   with all but forty-five days suspended,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   and two years of probation for the OUI conviction and forty-five days in prison, to run concurrently, for the conviction of operating beyond a license condition or restriction. The court also imposed fines and surcharges amounting to $1,405.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   [\u00b6 8] LeMeunier-Fitzgerald timely appealed.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   15 M.R.S. \u00a7 2115 (2017) ; M.R. App. P. 2(b)(2)(A) (Tower 2016).\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   She argues that the blood test violated the Fourth Amendment's protection against unreasonable searches and seizures because it was taken without a warrant and her consent to the test was rendered involuntary by the warning of an increased minimum sentence if she refused to consent and was then convicted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   II. DISCUSSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   [\u00b6 9] We anchor our analysis in the language of the United States Constitution. \"The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by Oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized.\" U.S. Const. amend. IV. There is no question that strictures of the Fourth Amendment apply to searches in the form of blood tests.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Schmerber v. California\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12047531\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/384/757/#p767\">\n    384 U.S. 757\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 767-72,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12047531\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/384/757/#p767\">\n    86 S.Ct. 1826\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12047531\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/384/757/#p767\">\n    16 L.Ed.2d 908\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1966). The question is how those strictures apply here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   [\u00b6 10] In recent years, courts across the country have been challenged to find an appropriate balance between a defendant's right to be free from \"unreasonable\" searches of their blood for its alcohol content and the State's interest in addressing the public safety crisis resulting from impaired drivers causing death and destruction on America's roads.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   U.S. Const. amend. IV. We endeavor here to assure that the constitution's prohibition against unreasonable searches and seizures is given full force, with the required determination of reasonableness informed by a full consideration of urgent public safety considerations.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   In this opinion, we (A) summarize the Fourth Amendment jurisprudence regarding searches undertaken for purposes of blood-alcohol testing; (B) review the statutory basis for providing warnings about the legal consequences of a refusal to submit to testing; and (C) consider the legal question of whether a driver who consents to a blood draw after receiving such warnings has voluntarily consented, recognizing, as the First Circuit has eloquently explained, that a defendant's consent that has been \"pried loose by ... a claim of authority is merely acquiescence.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <em>\n    United States v.

In addition, the defendant's license is suspended for an additional 275 days. 29-A M.R.S. \u00a7 2521(6). That means that each individual convicted of OUI, when that conviction involves a refusal, receives a sentence that involves an additional $100 in fines, an extension to his license suspension, and a 4-day jail sentence. 29-A M.R.S. \u00a7\u00a7 2411(5)(A)(1)-(3), 2521(6). For defendants with prior offenses, the differences between an OUI and an OUI with refusal become more significant-a $700 versus a $900 fine and seven days in jail versus twelve days in jail as to a second offense; $1,100 versus $1,400 and thirty days versus forty days for a third offense; and $2,100 versus $2,500 and six months versus six months and twenty days for a fourth offense. 29-A M.R.S. \u00a7 2411(5)(B)(1)-(2), (C)(1)-(2), D(1)-(2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   [\u00b6 41] The Court concludes, however, that because the applicable class of the offense is the same whether the defendant is convicted of OUI or OUI with a refusal-and therefore the\n   <em>\n    maximum\n   </em>\n   sentences are identical-no \"demonstrable increase in punishment\" can be said to result from the refusal. Court's Opinion \u00b6 29. This point is grounded primarily in the government's interest in crime classification systems. In determining whether LeMeunier-Fitzgerald's consent was voluntarily given, however, we are primarily concerned with the effect of the government's warnings\n   <em>\n    on LeMeunier-Fitzgerald\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Birchfield\n   </em>\n   , 579 U.S. ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12597986\" index=\"123\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/2160/#p2186\">\n    136 S.Ct. at 2186\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . That she could be charged with the same class of crime with the same maximum sentence, whether or not she refused to submit to the blood test, does not render LeMeunier-Fitzgerald's consent voluntary in light of the warning that one option-refusing to submit-would subject her to a higher minimum criminal penalty. The sentence for OUI\n   <em>\n    might\n   </em>\n   be higher than the mandatory minimum for OUI, but the sentence for OUI with refusal\n   <em>\n    must\n   </em>\n   be higher than the mandatory minimum for OUI.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   [\u00b6 42] Although it is true that a defendant in Maine, unlike a defendant in North Dakota in 2013, can be sentenced to those heightened terms only if convicted of the underlying OUI, 29-A M.R.S. \u00a7 2411(1-A)(A), (C) (2017), this is a distinction without a difference. Whether a criminal penalty for refusal is labeled an independent crime, an increase in the class of crime\n   (thereby increasing the authorized sentence), or the imposition of a heightened authorized or mandatory minimum sentence, the legal effect on a defendant is indistinguishable: the defendant who refuses to submit to a blood test and is convicted of that refusal as part of an OUI conviction is subjected to a minimum criminal penalty for the refusal that otherwise would not apply. Given this identical effect, I submit that we must evaluate Maine's duty-to-submit statute as applied to LeMeunier-Fitzgerald according to the Supreme Court's analysis in\n   <em>\n    Birchfield\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   [\u00b6 43] The crux of the Supreme Court's disposition as to Birchfield was its conclusion that it is a violation of the Fourth Amendment to expose a defendant to criminal penalties for his or her lawful exercise of the right to withhold consent to a search in the form of a blood test.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Birchfield\n   </em>\n   , 579 U.S. at ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12597986\" index=\"124\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/2160/#p2186\">\n    136 S.Ct. at 2186\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The logical corollary to both principles is that it is a violation of the Fourth Amendment to allow the State, in a criminal matter, to use the evidence obtained from a search undertaken after warning the accused that, if she is convicted of OUI, her refusal will be used as evidence against her during trial and, if proved, will subject her to an increased criminal penalty.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   [\u00b6 45] In a criminal prosecution, when the State fails to obtain the warrant that is the hallmark of a reasonable search and seizure and when no exigent circumstances otherwise exist, the State may not use the only avenue remaining to justify the search-obtaining the suspect's consent to the search-by informing the suspect that she has\n   <em>\n    no lawful choice but to consent\n   </em>\n   . Just as it is per se unreasonable to subject a defendant to a criminal penalty for refusing\n   a blood test, the threat of such a criminal penalty negates any consent given after such a warning in the context of a criminal prosecution.

In\n   <em>\n    Barlow\n   </em>\n   , this Court specifically said that,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-84\">\n   [w]here an officer ... conveys to the defendant by affirmative misrepresentations that he has the right to search without a warrant as in the instant case, the defendant's consent to the search given in response to such false assertions must be regarded as the mere submission of a law-abiding citizen to an officer of the law and cannot be construed as a valid waiver of [her] constitutional rights against an unreasonable search and seizure.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8033666\" index=\"221\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/320/895/#p900\">\n    320 A.2d at 900\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   [\u00b6 52] Here,\n   <em>\n    Birchfield\n   </em>\n   compels us to conclude that the implied consent warning stating that a defendant has a duty to submit to a chemical test to determine her alcohol level is a misrepresentation of the law. This is no different than the police officers in\n   <em>\n    Barlow\n   </em>\n   who told the defendant that they had the right to search without a warrant.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Barlow\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8033666\" index=\"222\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/320/895/#p900\">\n    320 A.2d at 898-99\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Both involved misrepresentations of the law intended to overcome a defendant's right to withhold consent to a search. In light of\n   <em>\n    Birchfield\n   </em>\n   , LeMeunier-Fitzgerald did not have a duty to take a blood test; she had an absolute right to\n   <em>\n    refuse to consent\n   </em>\n   to a blood test.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Birchfield\n   </em>\n   , 569 U.S. at ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12597986\" index=\"223\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/2160/#p2186\">\n    136 S.Ct. at 2186\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Therefore, just as the threat of an enhanced criminal\n   penalty is coercive as a matter of law, a police officer's statement that a defendant has a \"duty to submit to and complete chemical tests to determine ... alcohol level and drug concentration\" is coercive as a matter of law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   B. Comment on Evidentiary Consequences of Refusal\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   [\u00b6 53] The second statement made to the defendant also constitutes a misrepresentation of the law. The police officer, again reading from Maine's implied consent form, stated to LeMeunier-Fitzgerald:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-89\">\n   Your failure to submit to a chemical test is admissible against you at any trial for operating while under the influence of intoxicating liquor or drugs.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   Because\n   <em>\n    Birchfield\n   </em>\n   gives a defendant the constitutional right to refuse to submit to a blood test, informing LeMeunier-Fitzgerald that if she refused, that refusal would be admissible against her at trial, was a misrepresentation of the law, and thus coercive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   [\u00b6 54] We recently held in\n   <em>\n    State v. Glover\n   </em>\n   that the State may not comment on a defendant's failure to give consent to a search.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6963230\" index=\"224\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/89/1077/\">\n    2014 ME 49\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6\u00b6 16-17,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6963230\" index=\"225\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/89/1077/\">\n    89 A.3d 1077\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In\n   <em>\n    Glover\n   </em>\n   , the defendant exercised his constitutional right not to submit to a warrantless DNA test, and the State repeatedly referenced Glover's refusal to consent to the warrantless search.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 14\n   <em>\n    .\n   </em>\n   Relying on the principle that the \"value of constitutional privileges is largely destroyed if persons can be penalized for relying on them,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 13 (quotation marks omitted), we \"conclude[d] that the manner in which Glover's exercise of a constitutional right was used to penalize him at trial [was] fundamentally unfair and contrary to the principles of justice that encourage the free exercise of constitutional rights,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 16.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   [\u00b6 55] After\n   <em>\n    Glover,\n   </em>\n   telling a defendant that the prosecution will use her refusal against her if she does not agree to the blood test is a significant misrepresentation of the law. Ultimately, it is not important what could happen at trial; it is the misrepresentation of the law at the time of the inducement of consent that is of import. When an officer misrepresents the law and allows the defendant to believe that any refusal to consent will be used against her at trial, the misrepresentation is inherently coercive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   [\u00b6 56] I would hold that it was coercive as a matter of law to tell LeMeunier-Fitzgerald the following three things: (1) that she would face an enhanced criminal penalty for refusal to submit to a blood test, (2) that she had a \"duty to submit\" to the blood test, and (3) that any evidence of her refusal would be admissible against her in a trial. The State's implied consent form should be modified to remove the language that misrepresents the law in light of\n   <em>\n    Birchfield\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n <opinion type=\"dissent\">\n  <author id=\"p-94\">\n   HJELM, J., dissenting.\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   [\u00b6 57] I join Justice Gorman in her dissent from the Court's conclusion that no coercion results from a law enforcement officer's statement to a driver that, if she is ultimately convicted of OUI, her failure to submit to a blood draw would subject her to an enhanced criminal penalty-including a minimum mandatory jail term. I part ways with Justice Gorman's analysis only on the issue of the legal and procedural consequences of our mutual conclusion that the officer's duty-to-submit warning was coercive. In my view, the coercion resulting from the warning given to LeMeunier-Fitzgerald does not render her submission to the blood draw involuntary as a matter of law. Rather, the coercive effect of the warning is one factor within the totality of the circumstances that the\n   trial court must consider in its voluntariness analysis. For that reason, I would remand the matter for the court to reconsider the issue of whether LeMeunier-Fitzgerald's submission to the blood draw ultimately was voluntary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   [\u00b6 58] In the face of LeMeunier-Fitzgerald's challenge to the admissibility of evidence obtained from the blood sample, the State bore the burden of proving that her consent to the search that produced the blood sample \"was, in fact, freely and voluntarily given.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

For the reasons explained in Justice Gorman's dissent, the court's analysis was erroneous. That error, however, is not dispositive and does not warrant the conclusion as a matter of law that the challenged evidence must be excluded. This is because evidence of coercion arising from the duty-to-submit warning is but one element-albeit potentially a significant one-within the universe of circumstances revealed by the evidence presented at the motion hearing. Indeed, although the parties stipulated to certain facts, including the content of the refusal-related warnings provided to LeMeunier-Fitzgerald, the State also presented testimony from the officer describing \"the scene\" at the hospital, where the\n   officer informed her of the consequences of a refusal. In that testimony, the officer described LeMeunier-Fitzgerald's demeanor during his interactions with her, her conduct, and other factual matters such as her execution of a medical release form. All of this information is material to reveal the broader context in which LeMeunier-Fitzgerald decided to submit to the blood draw and which the court must consider-in conjunction with the coercive warning-when evaluating the voluntariness of that decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   [\u00b6 60] In\n   <em>\n    Birchfield\n   </em>\n   , after determining that the implied consent warnings were improper, the Court remanded the Beylund matter for the trial court to reconsider whether, based on the totality of the circumstances and notwithstanding the coercive effect of the warnings, Beylund's consent was voluntary. 579 U.S. ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12597986\" index=\"242\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/2160/#p2186\">\n    136 S.Ct. at 2186-87\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In my view, the same situation exists here. Because the trial court committed legal error in its treatment of the warnings, I would remand the matter for the court to reconsider whether, based on the totality of the circumstances that includes the coercion created by the duty-to-submit warning-the State has proved that LeMeunier-Fitzgerald voluntarily submitted to the blood draw.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"17\">\n   <p id=\"p-117\">\n    The same principle applies to the issue of voluntariness in other contexts, such as statements to law enforcement.\n    <em>\n     See, e.g.,\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Dickerson v.
