The dispositive issue is whether, under the Pittsburgh Code (Code), a structure may be designated \"historic\" where the structure's owner objects to the designation and City Council does not vote in favor of the designation, but rather the designation occurs as a result of City Council's inaction,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , its deemed approval. Concluding it may not, we affirm the trial court's vacation of the \"deemed\" historical designation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The property at issue is located at 486 South Graham Street in the City (subject property). The subject property is improved with a structure that housed what was formerly known as the Albright Community United Methodist Church (Church). The owner of record of the subject property is the Western Annual Conference of the United Methodist Church (Conference). All real estate owned by Methodist churches, although often held in the name of the local church, is encumbered by a trust imposed through church law and recognized by the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania. Tr. Ct., Slip Op., 11/20/17, at 2 (citing\n   <em>\n    W. Pa. Conference of United Methodist Church v. Everson Evangelical Church of N. Am.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"579900\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/pa/454/434/\">\n    454 Pa. 434\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=312%20A.2d%2035\">\n    312 A.2d 35\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1973) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In November 2013, the Church ceased occupying the structure on the subject property. As a result, the subject property fell into a state of disrepair. When the Church became unable to maintain, support and use the subject property, the Conference began to pay certain costs and expenses and otherwise maintain and secure the subject property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In August 2015, certain individuals submitted a nomination to the City's Historic Review Commission (HRC) to designate the subject property as historic. This nomination included a letter on Church stationery that purported to show the owner's consent. When the Conference became aware of the nomination, it contacted the City's Law Department to notify it that the Conference was the owner of the subject property. As a result, the HRC declined to accept the first nomination petition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Thereafter, an individual filed a second nomination petition with the HRC to designate the structure on the subject property as historic. The Conference objected to the nomination. Despite the Conference's objection, the HRC accepted the second nomination, and it notified the Conference that it was prohibited from exercising certain property rights, including altering the exterior of the structure on the subject property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The Conference's Chancellor wrote to the HRC to provide further opposition to the HRC's consideration of the historic nomination. Thereafter, Conference representatives attended the HRC's February 2016 public meeting and objected to consideration of the nomination on various grounds, including that the HRC lacked jurisdiction under the Code. Over the Conference's objection, the HRC received evidence on the nomination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In March 2016, the HRC conducted a second hearing on the nomination at which the Conference again objected. The HRC voted to recommend that the subject property be designated historic over these objections.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Approximately two months later, the City Planning Commission (Planning Commission) held a public hearing on the second nomination. Counsel for the Conference appeared and objected to the jurisdiction of the Planning Commission and the City concerning the second nomination. Nevertheless, the Planning Commission voted to approve the second nomination. The Planning Commission transmitted its decision to City Council.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In June 2016, a resolution regarding the second nomination of the subject property was introduced before City Council and was read and referred to a committee. The Conference submitted a written objection to the nomination to the City Clerk in July 2016. Thereafter, City Council held a public hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Both the Conference's Chancellor and its counsel appeared at the hearing and contested the nomination and the City's jurisdiction to deem the property historic.\n   <em>\n    City Council never voted on whether the subject property should be designated historic\n   </em>\n   . Nevertheless, the City Clerk issued an official disposition reflecting that the status of the designation of the structure on the subject property as historic \"Passed Finally\" and \"Passed pursuant to Case Law.\" Tr. Ct., Slip Op., at 4; Certified Record (C.R.), Item # 1, Ex. 1. The Conference filed an appeal to the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Before the trial court, the parties filed briefs and presented oral argument. Thereafter, the trial court issued an order sustaining the Conference's appeal and vacating the historic designation of the structure on the subject property. The City filed a notice of appeal to this Court, and the trial court directed it to file a concise statement of the errors complained of on appeal pursuant to Pa. R.A.P. 1925(b), which it did. The trial court subsequently issued an opinion pursuant to Pa. R.A.P. 1925(a) in which it explained the rationale for its order. Of particular relevance here, the trial court explained:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   The [Code] is clear in that, where the owner of a nominated property objects to the proposed historic designation, the designation of a nominated structure, site, or object shall require the affirmative vote of six (6) members of City Council. Despite the [Conference's] continuous objections at each and every step of these proceedings, the City erroneously and unconstitutionally concluded that a deemed approval occurred despite written opposition by the owner.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   An approval without City Council action is only appropriate if the owner of the property failed to object to the recommendations\n   made by the HRC and Planning Commission. In the case\n   <em>\n    sub judice\n   </em>\n   , the [Conference] has strenuously and consistently objected to the City's recommendation. The [Code] provides that, '[t]he designation of a nominated structure, site, or object shall require the affirmative vote of six (6) members of [City] Council if the owner or [sic] record of the property has submitted to [City] Council his or her written and signed opposition to the designation of the property[.]' [Section 1101.03(j)(2) of the Code.] An affirmative vote by six (6) members of City Council has yet to occur.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Tr. Ct., Slip Op., at 9-10 (footnotes omitted). This matter is now before us for disposition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Issues\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   On appeal, the City presents three issues:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   [1] Did the [trial court] abused [sic] its discretion when there was substantial evidence in the record for the [l]ocal [a]gency to find that the structure in this case was no longer being used for religious worship, and thus was not eligible for the narrowly tailored self-nomination exception for historic designation of religious structures used as a place of religious worship per [Title 11 of the Code]-Historic Preservation?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   [2] Did the [trial court] abuse its discretion by not deferring to the [l]ocal [a]gency's interpretation and application of Title 11 of the technical term 'religious structure' and the City's precedence for accepting and approving historic nomination of religious structures no longer used as places of religious worship in the past?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   [3] Did the [trial court] make an error of law in ascertaining the legislative intent of Title 11 per the rules of statutory construction, pursuant to 1 Pa. [C.S.] \u00a7\u00a7 1901, 1903, 1921, 1922, 1923, 1932 and 1934 (1972), which required the [trial court] to consider, among other things, the presumed [c]onstitutional intent of [the City], the occasion and necessity for the [o]rdinance under review here, the circumstances under which this [o]rdinance was enacted, the technical use of the word 'religious structure' in historic nomination proceedings in the [City], and the administrative interpretations of [Title 11 of the Code]?\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Appellant's Br. at 10-11.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    III. Discussion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Contentions\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   In their briefs to this Court, the parties focus heavily on the issue of whether the structure on the subject property is still used for religious purposes as it relates to who may nominate a structure for an historic designation. However, the parties devote little attention to the issue of whether a structure can be designated \"historic\" under the Code where its owner objects to the designation and City Council does not vote in favor of the designation, but rather the structure is designated \"historic\" as a result of City Council's inaction,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , its \"deemed approval.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   On this latter issue, the City points out that, at the end of its opinion, the trial court stated that an affirmative vote by six members of City Council had yet to occur here. The City asserts the trial court did not indicate if that fact was probative to its conclusion. However, the City argues, the Conference waived its right to review City\n   Council's deemed approval of the historic designation when the Conference \"refused the opportunity to request an affirmative vote of six (6) member [sic] of City Council at Settlement Conferences.\" Appellant's Br. at 40.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   In any event, the City contends, the Code's \"deemed approval\" provision,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Section 1101.03(j)(3) of the Code, was more recently enacted than the provision requiring an affirmative vote by City Council,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Section 1101.03(j)(2) of the Code. Further, the City asserts the deemed approval provision affords deference to the administrative bodies with expertise in this area, which both recommended the historic designation here. The City therefore argues the deemed approval provision should control over the provision requiring an affirmative vote of six City Council members.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   1 Pa. C.S. \u00a7 1934 (\"Irreconcilable clauses in the same statute\") (\"[W]henever, in the same statute, several clauses are irreconcilable, the clause last in order of date or position shall prevail.\"). Because Section 1101.03(j)(3) of the Code was enacted last in time and order, the City asserts, City Council properly utilized that provision here.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=312%20A.2d%2035\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The Conference responds that the City waived for appellate review the issue regarding the requirement of six affirmative votes by City Council because the City did not raise this issue in its Pa. R.A.P. 1925(b) Statement. The Conference argues the City's Pa. R.A.P. 1925(b) Statement in no part references the trial court's conclusion that, where the owner of a nominated property submits its written objection to City Council, an affirmative vote of six City Council members is required. Because the City was well aware that this issue was raised in the Conference's appeal to the trial court,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Supplemental Reproduced Record (S.R.R.) at 13b, and briefed and argued before the trial court, the Conference asserts, the City's choice to omit this issue from its Pa. R.A.P. 1925(b) Statement bars review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   As to the merits of this issue, the Conference contends City Council never voted on whether the structure should be designated historic. The Conference acknowledges the Code states that, where both the HRC and the Planning Commission recommend that a property be designated historic, City Council's failure to vote within 120 days after receipt of the Planning Commission's decision constitutes a deemed approval of the historic designation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Section 1101.03(j)(3) of the Code. However, it asserts, where the record owner of a nominated property objects to the proposed historic designation, \"[t]he designation of a nominated structure, site, or object shall require the affirmative vote of six (6) members of [City] Council ....\" Section 1101.03(j)(2) of the Code. The Conference contends the City erroneously concluded a deemed approval occurred here, despite the absence of the required affirmative vote of six members of City Council. The Conference further argues it is only where an owner does not object, and the HRC and Planning Commission recommend approval, that a deemed approval can occur through City Council's inaction.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Section 1101.03(j)(3) of the Code.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Analysis\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   The \"Historic Preservation\" regulations are set forth in Title 11 of the Code. Chapter 1101 governs \"Historic Structures, Districts, Sites and Objects.\" Further, Section 1101.03 of the Code states, in pertinent part (with emphasis added):\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   <strong>\n    \u00a7 1101.03-DESIGNATION OF HISTORIC STRUCTURES, DISTRICTS, SITES AND OBJECTS.\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   <strong>\n    * * * *\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   (j) (1) The designation of a nominated district, structure, site or object shall require the affirmative vote of six (6) members of [City] Council if either the [HRC] or the City Planning Commission (or both) recommends against designation.

We reject this assertion for several reasons.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   First, the City did not raise this issue in its Pa. R.A.P. 1925(b) Statement,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   S.R.R. at 26b-29b; therefore, it is waived. Pa. R.A.P. 1925(b)(4)(vii) ;\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth v.

Contrary to the City's assertion that Section 1101.03(j)(3) of the Code controls over Section 1101.03(j)(2) because Section 1101.03(j)(3) is last in order, the Code expressly states: \"The arrangement and classification of the Code have been made for the purpose of a convenient and orderly arrangement.\n   <em>\n    No inference, implication or presumption of legislative construction shall be drawn because of the location of any provision\n   </em>\n   ....\" Section 101.04(a)(2) of the Code (emphasis added). Further, contrary to the City's contentions, Section 1101.03(j)(3) was\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   enacted more recently than Section 1101.03(j)(2). Indeed, our review of the \"Code Comparative Table-Ordinances\" reveals that both provisions (and indeed the entirety of subsection (j) ) were enacted by Ordinance 27-2008, which became effective on January 1, 2009.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   More importantly, we disagree with the City that Sections 1101.03(j)(2) and (3) are irreconcilable. The City relies on Section 1934 of the Statutory Construction Act, which states: \"Except as provided in section 1933 of this title (relating to particular controls general), whenever, in the same statute, several clauses\n   <em>\n    are irreconcilable\n   </em>\n   , the clause last in order of date or position shall prevail.\" 1 Pa. C.S. \u00a7 1934 (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Pursuant to Section 1101.03(j)(2) of the Code: \"The designation of a nominated structure, site, or object shall require the affirmative vote of six (6) members of [City] Council\n   <em>\n    if the owner of record of the property has submitted to [City] Council his or her written and signed opposition to the designation of the property\n   </em>\n   .\" (Emphasis added.) Thus, where the owner of record objects to the historical designation of its property, such designation requires the affirmative vote of six City Council members.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7281100,4200990\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/16/484/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   On the other hand, Section 1101.03(j)(3) of the Code states: \"Where [City] Council fails to render its decision within the period required by this subsection, or fails to hold the required public hearing within one hundred twenty (120) days from the date of the [HRC] and the Planning Commission's recommendations, the failure of [City] Council to act shall be a deemed approval if both the [HRC] and the Planning Commission gave affirmative recommendations for the historic designation.\" This Section makes no mention of an objection by the owner of record of the property.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7281100,4200990\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/16/484/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Therefore, Section 1101.03(j)(3) applies where City Council fails to issue a timely decision (or hold a timely hearing), both the HRC and the Planning Commission provide affirmative recommendations for the historic designation, and the owner of record does\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   object to the historical designation of its property. To construe the deemed approval provision otherwise would effectively impinge on an objecting property owner's due process property rights.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   As a result, Sections 1101.03(j)(2) and (j)(3) are not irreconcilable. Instead, the two provisions address two different scenarios: (1) where the owner of record objects to the historical designation of its property (Section 1101.03(j)(2) ); and (2) where the owner of record does\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   object to the historical designation of its property and both the HRC and the Planning Commission give affirmative recommendations\n   for the historic designations (Section 1101.03(j)(3) ).\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Here, the Conference, the owner of record of the structure on the subject property, submitted to City Council its written and signed opposition to the historical designation of its property. Reproduced Record at 365-67. Therefore, the historical designation of the nominated structure required the affirmative vote of six members of City Council. Section 1101.03(j)(2) of the Code. There is no dispute that City Council here never voted on whether the structure on the subject property should be designated historic.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   C.R., Item # 1 at 10 (\u00b6 47), Item # 5 at 2 (\u00b6 14). Therefore, it is clear that the designation of the nominated structure on the subject property received\n   <em>\n    no\n   </em>\n   affirmative votes by City Council.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7281100,4200990\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/16/484/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Under these circumstances, the historical designation of the nominated structure on the subject property was improper.
