(Honeywell), a New Jersey based corporation, for thousands of bodily-injury claims premised on exposure to brake and clutch pads (friction products) containing asbestos. We granted certification to address\n   two issues. First, we consider whether the law of New Jersey or Michigan (the headquarters location of Honeywell's predecessor when the disputed excess insurance policies were issued) should control in the allocation of insurance liability among insurers for nationwide products-liability claims. Second, we address whether it was error not to require the policyholder, Honeywell, to contribute in the allocation of insurance liability based on the time after which the relevant coverage became unavailable in the marketplace (that is, since 1987).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In addressing the allocation question, we note that Honeywell does not seek coverage in this dispute for claims that involve initial product exposure occurring after insurance was not available and while the policyholder continued to manufacture the product. Although some of the claims presented involve injury that manifested after the date of excess-insurance unavailability, the class of claims to be addressed by the coverage block of insurance all presume that product exposure predated the insurance unavailability. Thus, consistent with New Jersey's continuous-trigger doctrine, Honeywell is seeking coverage under excess insurance policies for claims only from exposure occurrences during the period of policy coverage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Different jurisdictions approach pinpointing the occurrence of injury using varying methodologies. We, and a majority of jurisdictions, rely on medical science that teaches asbestos-related disease is progressive, as body tissue is injured when an individual inhales asbestos fibers.\n   <em>\n    Owens-Illinois, Inc. v.

We draw from the panel's summary of the facts and procedural history and credit the panel for its fine work.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   A.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   By way of general background, The Bendix Corporation (Bendix)-a corporate predecessor to defendant Honeywell-for many years manufactured and sold friction products that contained asbestos. Bendix stopped using asbestos in its friction products in 2001, having continued to manufacture the items even after 1987 when insurance for asbestos-related claims for such products ceased to be available in the marketplace.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Beginning around 1975, Bendix began to receive liability claims asserting that asbestos in its friction products caused bodily injury\n   to users. In the years leading up to the summary judgment proceedings in this matter, Bendix and its successors received approximately 147,000 claims, of which about 71,000 have been resolved. Claimants sued Bendix in almost all fifty states, and its insurers have spent more than $1 billion on indemnity payments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Certain matters are undisputed. The friction products contained asbestos. Honeywell is responsible for asbestos liabilities attributed to Bendix, although it disputes the dangerousness of its friction products. And, excess insurance coverage for asbestos-related personal injury claims became unavailable for purchase after April 1, 1987.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   In 2000, Continental Insurance Company (Continental) (which wrote many primary insurance policies for Bendix during the relevant years), and related companies, commenced this action seeking declaratory relief concerning the rights and obligations associated with insurance coverage for the asbestos-related bodily injury claims filed against Honeywell as a corporate successor to Bendix. Bendix advanced cross-claims and third-party claims against various insurers, including Travelers Casualty &amp; Surety Company (Travelers) and St. Paul Fire and Marine Insurance Company (St. Paul).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Honeywell settled with Continental and most other insurers. The ten insurance policies that remain at issue involve excess insurance issued to Bendix by Travelers and St. Paul. Eight of the policies were issued to Bendix by Travelers's predecessor, Aetna Casualty &amp; Surety Company (Aetna). Two of the policies were issued by St. Paul. St. Paul was since acquired by Travelers but is separately identified for purposes of this appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The choice-of-law issue in this matter arose from the following procedural actions. Honeywell filed a motion for partial summary judgment in 2006, asking the court to apply New Jersey insurance allocation law while opposing the application of Michigan law. Travelers opposed Honeywell's motion and filed a cross-motion, seeking the application of Michigan law to its policies. St. Paul did not oppose Honeywell's motion or make a separate motion. The\n   motion judge granted Honeywell's motion, denied Travelers's cross-motion, and held that the laws of New Jersey would apply to the insurance allocation questions. The court memorialized its order on November 9, 2006.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   With that general background in mind, we turn to some finer details.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   B.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Bendix was incorporated in 1929 under the laws of the State of Delaware. Aspects of its business took place in different states. During the course of its corporate existence, Bendix had manufacturing operations in all fifty states and twenty-two foreign countries, and sold its products\n   throughout the United States. Administratively though, from about 1940 to 1969, Bendix maintained its headquarters in South Bend, Indiana, while also having central offices in Detroit and New York. Its insurance office was in South Bend. Between 1969 and 1983, Bendix situated its executive headquarters, including its insurance office, in Michigan; another central office was in New York. Bendix also had significant contacts with New Jersey. Until 1973, Bendix's largest center of operations and payroll was in New Jersey.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Bendix had a variety of businesses, spanning such areas as automotive products, aerospace products, industrial products, financial services, and others. Included among its products are those at the center of the claims at issue here: friction products.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Bendix and its successors manufactured asbestos products in New York from 1939 until 2001 and in Tennessee from 1965 through 2001. As noted, asbestos ceased to be used as a component of the friction products in 2001.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Honeywell is the corporate successor to Bendix as a result of the following corporate changes. The Allied Corporation (Allied) acquired Bendix in 1983 and operated it as a wholly owned subsidiary, assuming Bendix's obligations and liabilities. Allied was incorporated under the laws of the State of New York and had its\n   principal place of business in New Jersey. In 1985, Allied and Signal Companies merged, becoming wholly-owned subsidiaries of The Allied-Signal Inc., a new Delaware corporation that also has been headquartered in New Jersey since the merger. The Allied-Signal Inc. changed its name to AlliedSignal Inc. in 1993; AlliedSignal Inc. merged with Honeywell, Inc., in December of 1999 and changed its name to Honeywell. Honeywell was incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware, but its headquarters and principal place of business have always been located in Morristown, New Jersey.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Since 1983, all insurance operations for Bendix and its successors have been located in New Jersey. In total, Honeywell has purchased more than $3.5 billion in umbrella and excess insurance for Bendix's and its successors' liabilities from insurers whose principal places of business were located in over fourteen states and countries, including New Jersey.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   It appears not to be disputed that the excess insurance policies, which were not subject to settlement before the trial court, were all brokered, issued, and delivered to Bendix in Michigan. Travelers's predecessor, Aetna, issued its disputed policies to Bendix between 1977 and 1983; St. Paul issued its disputed policies between 1968 and 1970. None of the policies contain a choice-of-law provision governing the allocation issue before us.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   C.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   As noted, the trial court granted Honeywell's motion for partial summary judgment in 2006, holding that New Jersey insurance-allocation law would apply in this matter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   When, in 2011, the motion court addressed motions for partial summary judgment that involved the dispute over the duration of the coverage block of insurance, the parties were eleven years into the case. The parties asked the court to consider resolving six issues as a matter of law, as well as to appoint a special allocation master as\n   <em>\n    Owens-Illinois\n   </em>\n   suggested would be appropriate for complicated, long tail, asbestos-injury-claims cases.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   The duration of the coverage block teed up the issue of the unavailability rule's application in this matter. All parties agreed that the beginning point would be\n   1940. Continental, the primary insurer for many years, started paying out claims in the 1980s, before\n   <em>\n    Owens-Illinois\n   </em>\n   was decided in 1994. It had some years in which its policy had no upper limit. Consistent with promoting the interests of its insured, it began paying claims for claimants and to assist Bendix and its successors in the resolution of claims, leaving coverage disputes to be resolved independently. Eventually, Continental assigned to Honeywell its rights with respect to the primary's responsibilities under allocation. That assignment included the considerable complication that its records made it difficult to determine how Continental had been variously assigning costs (i.e., defense costs or liability costs and to which matter), which affected the order of exhaustion of policies among insurers. As the record highlights, between 1980 and 1994, Continental's assignment of past defense costs was unclear and, once those costs could be identified, required assessment in respect of the allocation theory to be applied to this matter. That and other issues were implicated in this complicated matter of insurance liability allocation that was the essence of the complaint in this matter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   The trial court determined that one law on allocation should apply and that should be New Jersey law. That approach allowed the court to use one set of rules to sensibly and coherently allocate responsibility among insurers, over decades of actions, and the many payments already made by insurers, as well as the insured, depending on the policy-imposed obligations and coverage limitations held to apply. And, the court's determination was consistent with previous decisions that recognized that\n   <em>\n    Owens-Illinois\n   </em>\n   could be applied retroactively, including for defense costs.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Champion Dyeing &amp; Finishing Co. v. Centennial Ins. Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1130684\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj-super/355/262/#p270\">\n    355 N.J.

Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"727138\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/177/210/#p229\">\n    177 F.3d 210\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 229-31 (3d Cir. 1999) (applying\n   <em>\n    Owens-Illinois\n   </em>\n   retroactively).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   The determination of the coverage block was immensely important to the continued resolution of the issues. The\n   <em>\n    Owens-Illinois\n   </em>\n   allocation methodology, simply described, looks at the time on the risk horizontally and the total limits in each annual period vertically. Thus, an endpoint to the coverage block of insurance to be divvied up for claims and defense costs is essential to the calculation and to the assignment of risk to be borne by primary insurers and exhausted in each policy year before the excess insurer is tapped for its contributions for that year.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <em>\n    Owens-Illinois\n   </em>\n   utilizes that allocation approach, recognizing also a continuous-trigger doctrine to explain the basis for recognizing occurrences in the year of first exposure to asbestos and in each subsequent policy year. To avoid having its insurance triggered, an insurer has the burden of showing that exposure did not occur earlier or during the policy year for which it wrote coverage for the insured. Otherwise, manifestation of injury presenting itself thereafter resulted in allocation of that individual's claim, in accordance with mathematical formulae, to that insurer's policy year.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   It was within the context of that setting and law that the motion court considered the parties arguments over the duration of the coverage block. Travelers (taking the lead in argument) and St. Paul, both excess insurers, argued that the coverage block should run until the year in which Honeywell, as the successor to Bendix, ceased manufacturing the friction products-2001. Honeywell maintained that the coverage block should end in the 1986-87 period when first primary (1986) and then excess (April 1, 1987) insurance ceased to\n   be available. To the excess insurers, Honeywell was arguing for truncating the insurance coverage block. To Honeywell, Travelers was arguing for extenuation of the insurance coverage block.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   The unavailability rule's application in this case became a point of debate. Travelers asserted earlier in this matter that a fact question existed about whether insurance was available in the marketplace. In 2007, another motion judge ordered discovery and\n   a hearing on that question. When the presently discussed motion for partial summary judgment came before the deciding motion judge, the court concluded that there was no genuine issue of fact concerning the question. The court held that commercial policies were not available to Honeywell beginning with the 1986/87 period as it had maintained, and we note that fact determination is not challenged in this appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   As a result of the discovery that had taken place though, Travelers also argued, in connection with the partial summary judgment motion, that Honeywell was self-insured. In advancing that argument, it pointed to the company's maintenance of corporate reserves. Travelers further argued that Honeywell had assumed the risk and should be treated as responsible for the years that it continued to manufacture friction products after 1987 until 2001-another fifteen years, which would reduce the exposure of the excess carriers in the allocation methodology form that which would occur under a coverage block that ended in 1987.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   With respect to the reserves, the trial court dismissed the argument that maintenance of reserves is the equivalent of self-insurance. The court also rejected the argument that somehow that business practice of maintaining reserves represented an assumption of insurance risk relevant to resolution of the coverage block dispute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   The focal point to the argument and decision by the court was the unavailability rule application, or not, to determining triggered years of insurance for purposes of allocation under the\n   <em>\n    Owens-Illinois\n   </em>\n   paradigm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   On that point, the court heard from Travelers the arguments that continued manufacturing by Honeywell from 1987 to 2001 increased the number of pre-1987 exposure claims, increased the potential value of pre-1987 claims by alleged enhanced injury from continued exposure, and resulted in encouraging more people to file claims based on pre-1987 exposure.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Honeywell argued that the record lacked factual or expert evidence to support those assertions of inference. Moreover, Honeywell emphasized that\n   <em>\n    Owens-Illinois\n   </em>\n   allocation theory addressed assumption of insurance risk not assumption of tort risk.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Ultimately, the trial court agreed with Honeywell that the insurance coverage period should not be extended, as Travelers requested, to include years from 1987 to 2001. Applying\n   <em>\n    Owens-Illinois\n   </em>\n   's approach to allocation of insurance risk to claims arising exclusively from pre-1987 initial exposure, the court determined that the unavailability of commercial insurance should end the coverage block of insurance. Hence, the decision fixed with certainty the policies, with their specific terms and amounts, that were available for the special master to consider when allocating among insurers and Honeywell for that period of time alone. That July 22, 2011 decision had the result of not requiring the court, or anyone else, to attempt to determine how policy amounts or limits or related insurance concerns for post-1987 years would be overlaid on Honeywell during the 1987-2001 period when manufacturing continued or how such corporate finances\n   would be sorted out between post- and pre-1987 claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   After the parties consented to the appointment of a special allocation master (SAM), this matter proceeded before the SAM with policy years, policies, and amounts certain for the period of 1940-1987 as he addressed the already complicated issues before him. As the SAM's initial report to the trial court clearly noted before delving into the difficult issues assigned to him,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   [a] Bendix asbestos claim triggers those policies issued to Bendix and/or Honeywell that were in effect during the portion of the Trigger Period that is within the coverage block. Exposure to an asbestos product shall be presumed to be exposure to a Bendix product, with the burden shifting to each insurer to prove that there was no exposure to a Bendix product before or during its policy period. There is no coverage under a policy where the claimant's first exposure to asbestos from a Bendix product takes place after the effective period of a given policy expired.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   After holding hearings and hearing argument, the SAM issued a report and supplemental report containing recommendations on allocation. The trial court adopted the SAM's recommendations, with one exception not relevant to this appeal, and entered a final\n   judgment on September 16, 2013. By the time this matter reached appellate processes, almost all claims had settled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   D.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Travelers and St. Paul jointly appealed the trial court's two orders to the Appellate Division. They appealed the November 9, 2006 order, which granted Honeywell's partial summary judgment motion and applied New Jersey allocation law, and the July 22, 2011 order, which granted Honeywell's partial summary judgment motion and held that Honeywell had no allocation responsibility because after 1987 it was not able to obtain insurance coverage for asbestos claims. The Appellate Division affirmed the trial court but required a limited remand not pertinent to this appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   The appellate panel considered the trial court's choice-of-allocation-law ruling only as applied to Travelers's eight excess policies.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   In its substantive review of that question, the panel determined that there was a conflict between the insurance-allocation methodologies of New Jersey, as determined by\n   <em>\n    Owens-Illinois\n   </em>\n   , and the Michigan time-on-the-risk methodology, espoused by the Michigan Court of Appeals in\n   <em>\n    Arco Industries Corp. v.

The appellate panel considered the public policy interests of both states; the\n   interests of commerce among the states; the interests of the parties, including an evaluation of where the insurance policies were brokered, negotiated, underwritten, and issued; and the interest of judicial administration. Ultimately, the panel agreed with the trial court and concluded that the choice-of-law analysis supported the application of New Jersey law to Travelers's eight excess policies, which were in effect between February 1, 1977 and October 1, 1983.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   The appellate panel further agreed with the trial court that, under\n   <em>\n    Owens-Illinois\n   </em>\n   , Honeywell was not required to contribute to allocation for pre-1987 initial exposure claims even if the claimant did not manifest injury until after 1987, given that excess insurance for asbestos-related claims was not reasonably available for purchase after 1987.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   St. Paul and Travelers petitioned this Court for certification, raising both the choice-of-law and allocation issues.

The conflicts analysis here should center on\n   <em>\n    Restatement\n   </em>\n   \u00a7\u00a7 188 and 6, as our later decisions in\n   <em>\n    Spruance\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Pfizer\n   </em>\n   have taught.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-147\">\n   2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-148\">\n   Section 188 sets forth the contacts to be taken into account in applying the principles of \u00a7 6.

Having already abandoned the place of contracting (here Michigan) as the presumptive starting point, we adhere to the observation in\n   <em>\n    Restatement\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 188 cmt. e. on subsection (2), that \"[s]tanding alone, the place of contracting is a relatively insignificant contact.\" That is particularly true where, as here, the insured risk is not site-specific. The place of negotiation (again Michigan) can be of importance, as recognized in the\n   <em>\n    Restatement\n   </em>\n   's comment to \u00a7 188.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-150\">\n   However, two stronger considerations under \u00a7 188, applied to this matter, combine to point toward New Jersey. Here, the place of performance, \u00a7 188(c), and the domicile, residence, and places of incorporation and of business of the parties, \u00a7 188(e), all point to New Jersey. The latter takes into account enduring characteristics\n   and deserves to be a starting point in the analysis. Further, heavy weight must be given to the nature of the insured risk and its site, or to an otherwise performance-related location consideration. New Jersey is the longstanding domicile of the insured in this litigation (since 1983). Honeywell is the successor to the rights of Bendix under the insurance contract. As such, Honeywell's place of domicile and business (New Jersey) is easily determined at the time coverage is invoked due to litigation, triggering the terms of the insurance contract for these products liability claims. Relatedly, New Jersey is also the place of performance for the contractual defense and indemnification of Honeywell in this litigation involving long-tail claims on an occurrence policy for a predecessor's products cast into the national marketplace. Even before the New Jersey-based Honeywell became the successor to Bendix, New Jersey was integrally involved in Bendix's business operations. It is no stranger to the dispute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-151\">\n   With those contacts in mind, we turn to the\n   <em>\n    Restatement\n   </em>\n   's factors in section 6, helpfully condensed in\n   <em>\n    Pfizer\n   </em>\n   , for our analytical framework. The question is whether New Jersey's relationship with the case is sufficiently significant to warrant application of New Jersey law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-152\">\n   In examining the competing interests of the states, the first inquiry described in\n   <em>\n    Pfizer\n   </em>\n   consolidates several \u00a7 6 factors and asks, simply, whether application of the\n   competing states' laws would advance the policy interests that the law was intended to promote.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-153\">\n   <em>\n    Owens-Illinois\n   </em>\n   is very clearly a policy-driven opinion, identifying several policies sought to be promoted through application of our allocation methodology for progressive bodily injury claims based on asbestos exposure. Honeywell contends that application of the\n   <em>\n    Owens-Illinois\n   </em>\n   approach in this matter will promote those policies. We generally agree. The policies of maximizing insurance resources, encouraging the spreading of risk throughout the insurance industry, promoting the purchase of insurance when available, and considerations of simple justice all are important to this\n   state.\n   <em>\n    Owens-Illinois\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Carter-Wallace\n   </em>\n   focused on those policies. Fulfilling them will benefit the State because they achieve worthy goals enhancing the interests of a New Jersey insured, and the claimants who were injured by progressive asbestos-related disease, by maximizing insurance resources and prompting insureds to obtain and maintain insurance coverage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-154\">\n   To the extent that Michigan's time-on-the-risk approach also seeks to benefit insureds and claimants, application of New Jersey's allocation law will not undermine those Michigan interests. Moreover, it is far from clear what interest Michigan has in insisting that its allocation methodology apply in this insurance dispute, which no longer involves a Michigan-based company.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-155\">\n   Finally, although New Jersey's interest in the \"efficient use of the resources available to cope with environmental disease or damage,\"\n   <em>\n    Owens-Illinois\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1372879\" index=\"131\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj/138/437/#p454\">\n    138 N.J. at 472\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1372879\" index=\"132\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj/138/437/#p454\">\n    650 A.2d 974\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , may be less compelling in a products-liability case where the harm is not confined to New Jersey, the State's interest in \"simple justice\" will be advanced when the Travelers policies are subjected to the same New Jersey law as the St. Paul policies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-156\">\n   In sum, we do not see a strong Michigan interest in its allocation law being applied to this coverage dispute. This matter involves nationwide products-liability claims relating to items manufactured in virtually all fifty states and internationally, sold in the national marketplace, and that now are the liability of a successor, New Jersey-based corporation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-157\">\n   The second\n   <em>\n    Pfizer\n   </em>\n   factor considers commerce between the states. That factor is analytically similar to the prior one. It too supports application of New Jersey law. The inquiry focuses on \"whether application of a competing state's law would frustrate the policies of other states.\"\n   <em>\n    Pfizer\n   </em>\n   , 154 N.J. at 198,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1354487\" index=\"133\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj/154/187/#p198\">\n    712 A.2d 634\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-158\">\n   In addition to the competing interests of the states already discussed, the public policy goals further identified in\n   <em>\n    Arco\n   </em>\n   are prospective in nature. The Michigan Court of Appeals sought to promote predictability, discourage litigation, and reduce premiums.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-159\">\n   <em>\n    Arco\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"134\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=594%20N.W.2d%2061\">\n    594 N.W.2d at 70\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Application of Michigan's time-on-the-risk method in this instance cannot discourage litigation among these parties. Further, it would not promote predictability. As the Appellate Division noted, neither Bendix nor its insurers could have anticipated at the time of contracting that Michigan would adopt that allocation method, which was not yet part of Michigan's law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-160\">\n   The third factor considers the interests of the parties. Here the contacts outlined in \u00a7 188 of the\n   <em>\n    Restatement\n   </em>\n   come to the fore. Courts look to the parties' justified expectations and need for predictability, as well as the other contacts outlined in \u00a7 188. Travelers asserts that Michigan law should govern because Michigan was the place of contracting. However, as the Appellate Division noted, when the parties entered the now-disputed excess insurance policies, they could not have reasonably\n   anticipated the later adoption of the time-on-the-risk approach in Michigan. The parties did know though that the Travelers policies covered risk related to products that Bendix sold nationwide. The risk was not stationary; it extended beyond Michigan's borders. We are unpersuaded by Travelers's contention that the parties expected Michigan allocation law to govern.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-161\">\n   That said, we acknowledge that, at the time of contracting, the parties could not have expected New Jersey law to control either. However, section 188 directs courts to consider, among other factors, the place of performance,\n   <em>\n    Restatement\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 188(c), and the place of business of the parties,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"135\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=594%20N.W.2d%2061\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 188(e). We already determined that we view those two contacts as strongest in the resolution of this dispute and both point toward New Jersey. We give great weight in this analysis to Honeywell's status as a New Jersey corporation responsible for liability for asbestos-related claims based on pre-1987 exposure to its friction products. We conclude that this factor supports application of New Jersey allocation law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-162\">\n   Finally, we look at the interests of judicial administration under the last\n   <em>\n    Pfizer\n   </em>\n   factor, which asks \"what choice of law works best to\n   manage adjudication of the controversy before the court.\" 154 N.J. at 199,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1354487\" index=\"136\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj/154/187/#p198\">\n    712 A.2d 634\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The Court placed its faith in the discretion of skilled masters and encouraged \"the use of special case calendars, management conferences, monitoring, [and] alternative methods of dispute resolution.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1372879\" index=\"139\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj/138/437/#p454\">\n     Ibid.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-163\">\n   We agree with the Appellate Division that\n   <em>\n    Pfizer\n   </em>\n   's\"special judicial framework\" will best manage adjudication of this dispute. Travelers contends that procedural complexity will not serve the interests of judicial administration and argues instead for the simpler time-on-the-risk approach, which requires fewer resources. That argument fails to persuade, however, because the fourth factor focuses not only on resource use but also on \"best manage[ment]\" of the case. New Jersey's system is well suited to resolve a complex allocation controversy in a fair manner.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-164\">\n   In sum, we conclude, in this contract setting where no provision of the contract or of state law compels application of a specific state's law, that conflicts-of-law principles favor application of New Jersey allocation law in the present dispute over liability among insurers. Accordingly, for the reasons expressed, we affirm the Appellate Division on the first issue and turn to the second, questioning the use of our unavailability exception in that allocation methodology.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-165\">\n   IV.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-166\">\n   The continuous-trigger and related unavailability exception theories for allocation of insurance liability have been recognized and applied in this state since the 1994 decision in\n   <em>\n    Owens-Illinois\n   </em>\n   . As previously discussed, in that matter, which involved toxic-exposure to asbestos, we addressed the use of pollution-exclusion clauses in insurance policies and their impact on the policyholder. After considering strong policy arguments presented by all parties, we settled on the continuous-trigger doctrine and its related allocation methodology as being best for purposes of\n   assessing liability and promoting risk management.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1372879\" index=\"140\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj/138/437/#p454\">\n    138 N.J. at 478-79\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1372879\" index=\"141\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj/138/437/#p454\">\n    650 A.2d 974\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . We determined to use that method of allocation of liability because we found it superior by virtue of (1) encouraging the acquisition of insurance and spreading costs throughout the industry; (2) promoting the efficient use of insurance resources to make more money available to respond\n   in catastrophic circumstances; (3) compelling insurers to minimize their costs; and (4) advancing principles of simple justice.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1372879\" index=\"142\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj/138/437/#p454\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1372879\" index=\"142\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj/138/437/#p454\">\n    at 472-78\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1372879\" index=\"143\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj/138/437/#p454\">\n    650 A.2d 974\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-167\">\n   The continuous-trigger method assumes the availability of insurance and incorporates recognition of an unavailability exception. As we explained in\n   <em>\n    Owens-Illinois\n   </em>\n   , \"[w]hen periods of no insurance reflect a decision by an actor to assume or retain a risk, as opposed to periods when coverage for a risk is not available, to expect the risk-bearer to share in the allocation is reasonable.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1372879\" index=\"144\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj/138/437/#p454\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1372879\" index=\"144\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj/138/437/#p454\">\n    at 479\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1372879\" index=\"145\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj/138/437/#p454\">\n    650 A.2d 974\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The insurers contend that the Appellate Division misapplied this Court's precedent when it held Honeywell was entitled to coverage,\n   asserting that the panel's application of\n   <em>\n    Owens-Illinois\n   </em>\n   conflicts with the public policy objectives underpinning that decision. They urge us to conclude that Honeywell's decision to continue to manufacture and sell products containing asbestos, after insurance was no longer available, should result in requiring Honeywell to contribute to the losses from its past and future sale of those products. They urge the Court to find an \"exceptional circumstance\" warranting departure from\n   <em>\n    Owens-Illinois\n   </em>\n   in this case. Thus, they claim that, for purposes of performing the allocation of risk, the coverage block of insurance should have been extended to include all years that Honeywell continued to manufacture the friction products. They assert that, otherwise, application of the unavailability rule will encourage manufacturers to behave irresponsibly. Manufacturers, they argue, will be allowed to transfer the risk of that subsequent (post-insurance unavailability) conduct to their prior insurers. They do not ask for this Court to overrule\n   <em>\n    Owens-Illinois\n   </em>\n   and its unavailability exception in the allocation methodology, but argue about its application to the facts of this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-170\">\n   Joining with the insurers, as amicus curiae, is the Complex Insurance Claims Litigation Association (CICLA). CICLA's main argument is that this Court should abandon the unavailability doctrine altogether, an argument not raised by the insurers themselves. CICLA claims a trend in the law of other jurisdictions away from recognition of an unavailability exception. CICLA contends that the exception undermines the public policy objectives that support the allocation methodology of\n   <em>\n    Owens-Illinois\n   </em>\n   and encourages manufacturers to forego insurance while continuing to produce and sell potentially dangerous products. CICLA adds that the unavailability exception complicates insurance coverage litigation by creating additional issues requiring expanded discovery.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-171\">\n   In contrast, Honeywell primarily points to the record that establishes that excess insurance was no longer available after April 1987. Honeywell emphasizes that it is seeking coverage only\n   for claims alleging first exposure to a Bendix product before 1987-while Bendix and its successors had active occurrence-policy coverage for asbestos-based risks-even if manifestation occurred after that point in time. Honeywell stresses that, under existing law, their conduct after 1987 is not relevant because it does not affect the prior exposure for which they had purchased insurance. Thus, Honeywell contends, the\n   <em>\n    Owens-Illinois\n   </em>\n   unavailability rule was applied correctly and consistently with the policy objectives expressed in that opinion. Honeywell underscores that it is inaccurate for the insurers to contend that it is seeking to foist post-1987 conduct onto insurers. In the alternative, Honeywell contends that its adversaries misread\n   <em>\n    Owens-Illinois\n   </em>\n   to allow for liability allocation to an insured for a time when insurance was unavailable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-172\">\n   United Policyholders (UP), appearing as amicus curiae in support of Honeywell, argues that the trial court and Appellate Division appropriately applied the\n   <em>\n    Owens-Illinois\n   </em>\n   unavailability exception. UP notes that, in\n   <em>\n    Owens-Illinois\n   </em>\n   , the Court focused on the policyholder's conscious decision to forego the purchase of available insurance rather than the policyholder's decision to engage in a particular kind of business activity. In fact, UP contends, in\n   <em>\n    Owens-Illinois\n   </em>\n   the Court expressly contrasted a specific decision by an actor to assume or retain a risk during a period of no insurance with those periods when insurance coverage is not available. It too emphasizes that the record clearly establishes that excess-insurance coverage for asbestos risk was not available after 1987. UP further urges that we not abandon precedent because\n   <em>\n    Owens-Illinois\n   </em>\n   has offered certainty in its formula and has encouraged settlement of complex coverage disputes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-173\">\n   B.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-174\">\n   We have affirmed that the continuous-trigger theory of liability is the law of this state multiple times since the decision in\n   <em>\n    Owens-Illinois\n   </em>\n   .

Importantly, none of the initial asbestos exposures, on which claims Honeywell is seeking insurance coverage, occurred after insurance became unavailable. The claimants initially were exposed to asbestos at times when the manufacturer was covered by the excess insurance policies at issue. Although the disputed policies involved in this appeal\n   concern excess insurance, we are dealing with occurrence policies. Further, we are addressing claims pertaining to exposure to asbestos during the policy periods claimed to have caused progressive asbestos-related disease.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Owens-Illinois\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1372879\" index=\"180\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj/138/437/#p454\">\n    138 N.J. at 454\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1372879\" index=\"181\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj/138/437/#p454\">\n    650 A.2d 974\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (confirming injury to body tissue occurs on inhalation through exposure to asbestos fibers).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-183\">\n   This case simply does not present facts on which to consider abandoning the unavailability exception, let alone whether to create a novel equitable exception to that exception that would retroactively deprive parties of paid-for insurance coverage due to their post-coverage-period conduct. Sufficient justification for even contemplating taking steps to alter our allocation methodology, with its unavailability rule, is absent here. The continued application of the unavailability rule supports the public policy objectives originally intended by our prorated allocation methodology.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-184\">\n   For the reasons that preceded in this opinion's discussion of the trial court's motion practice, we agree with the Appellate Division that the trial court correctly kept its focus on whether Honeywell could reasonably have purchased insurance for asbestos-related claims. The assumption-of-risk language in\n   <em>\n    Owens-Illinois\n   </em>\n   , in context, addressed only assumption of an insurance risk for the existing claim periods when insurance was reasonably available but the insured elected not to purchase it. That is not what has happened here. Moreover, we decline to upend this long-litigated\n   dispute to recognize here an equitable exception to the unavailability rule.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-185\">\n   In light of the extended litigation and the fact that the manufacturer ceased producing these friction products seventeen years ago, we decline to disrupt the coverage block of insurance fixed by the trial court, which resulted in maximizing the insurance resources available for claimants. Indeed, the basic policy objectives of\n   <em>\n    Owens-Illinois\n   </em>\n   -of maximizing insurance resources, encouraging the spreading of risk throughout the insurance industry, promoting the purchase of insurance when available, and of simple justice-are all served by affirming the judgment and moving to closure this mammoth allocation dispute, going back to 1940 through to the ending of insurance availability in 1987. Further, we reject that this holding will disincentivize manufacturers from responsible behavior regarding products for which insurance becomes unavailable, for whatever reason may be discernable. This manufacturer ceased its production. Our affirmance of the insurance coverage block established in this matter is rooted in the overall record before us. To the extent that our dissenting colleague would use this case to have this matter address alterations to the continuous-trigger concept as it was originally fashioned, and to the\n   <em>\n    Owens-Illinois\n   </em>\n   allocation paradigm, in order to promote social policy regarding tort law, that invitation is not one that these circumstances compel us to accept.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-186\">\n   V.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-187\">\n   The judgment of the Appellate Division is affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-188\">\n   CHIEF JUSTICE RABNER and JUSTICES FERNANDEZ-VINA, SOLOMON, and TIMPONE join in JUSTICE LaVECCHIA's opinion.

Under the unavailability exception, this Court compels insurance carriers that previously insured the corporation-but later refuse to do so-to remain the guarantors for claims arising during the years the corporation continues to manufacture its dangerous products. This misguided application of the doctrine does not further notions of fairness or a rational public policy, as is evident from this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-192\">\n   Since 1940, The Bendix Corporation (Bendix)\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   secured insurance coverage for the brake and clutch pads it manufactured and sold. Those brake and clutch pads contained asbestos, a dangerous substance, which if inhaled by a worker can cause various respiratory diseases and even increase the risk of developing certain cancers -diseases that result many times in death.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,\n   <em>\n    Health Effects of Asbestos\n   </em>\n   , https://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/asbestos/health_effects_asbestos.html (last updated Nov. 3, 2016). Beginning in 1975, Bendix faced asbestos-related personal-injury claims from individuals across the country. By 1987, there were over 2,600 claims filed against Bendix for injuries allegedly caused by the asbestos-containing brake and clutch pads. Then, in 1988 alone, the number of claims soared to more than 3,600.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-193\">\n   By 1985, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) had recognized the increased harm related to extended exposure to asbestos.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,\n   <em>\n    NIOSH: Health Hazard Evaluation Report\n   </em>\n   5 (June 1985), https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/hhe/reports/pdfs/83-44-1596.pdf (describing asbestosis as \"form of pulmonary fibrosis secondary to the accumulation of airborne asbestos in the lungs\"). Not only is duration of exposure a risk factor in whether individuals eventually manifest an asbestos-related injury, it is also correlated with the severity of the injury.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1372879\" index=\"184\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj/138/437/#p454\">\n     Ibid.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (noting that severity of disease is correlated with type and duration of exposure to asbestos).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-194\">\n   Given the apparent health hazards and number of pending and expected personal-injury lawsuits relating to Bendix's brake and clutch pads, the primary insurance carriers in 1986 and then the excess insurers in 1987 declined to underwrite coverage for those products. Despite the known medical dangers of asbestos, more than a decade of lawsuits, and an insurance marketplace that refused to provide coverage for its asbestos products, Bendix opted to continue to manufacture its asbestos-containing\n   brake and clutch pads for fourteen more years without liability coverage. Bendix's decision put at risk the health and safety of countless workers exposed to the dangerous asbestos fibers in its products over those fourteen years.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-195\">\n   Now, a majority of the Court holds that Bendix, though it paid no premiums for coverage, is insured for the injuries caused to mechanics and others who worked with the products it continued to manufacture-so long as the first asbestos exposure predated the period when the company went bare of insurance. According to the majority, the insurance carriers that previously issued liability policies to Bendix must pick up this grisly tab. Of course, in the future, companies similarly situated to Bendix will have less\n   incentive to stop producing dangerous products under such a scheme.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-196\">\n   In my view, we have reached this point so in conflict with good public policy by not giving a common-sense reading to\n   <em>\n    Owens-Illinois\n   </em>\n   , a landmark case intended to further the public welfare.\n   <em>\n    Owens-Illinois\n   </em>\n   constructed a methodology to allocate insurance coverage among multiple policies in cases of progressive toxic diseases that run a course of years from the first exposure to the manifestation of the disease.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1372879\" index=\"185\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj/138/437/#p454\">\n    138 N.J. at 478-79\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1372879\" index=\"186\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj/138/437/#p454\">\n    650 A.2d 974\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The language in\n   <em>\n    Owens-Illinois\n   </em>\n   that is at the core of the controversy arises from one seemingly obscure phrase. The Court stated, \"[w]hen periods of no insurance reflect a decision by an actor to assume or retain a risk,\n   <em>\n    as opposed to periods when coverage for a risk is not available\n   </em>\n   , to expect the risk-bearer to share in the allocation is reasonable.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1372879\" index=\"197\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj/138/437/#p454\">\n     Ibid.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (emphasis added). The quoted clause is known as the unavailability exception.\n   <em>\n    Owens-Illinois\n   </em>\n   mentions the \"unavailability\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-198\">\n   of insurance in passing. There is no further explanation or support given for the clause.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-199\">\n   One logical interpretation of that clause accords with the notions of fairness and simple justice advanced in\n   <em>\n    Owens-Illinois\n   </em>\n   . If insurance is unavailable to a company for a product that it has stopped manufacturing, the insurance carriers that issued occurrence policies in prior years remain on the risk through the time until the disease manifests. No one would dispute the application of the allocation scheme in that manner.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-200\">\n   It is another thing, however, to say that a company, such as Bendix, that continues to manufacture an inherently dangerous product for which no insurance carrier will provide liability coverage can avoid full financial accountability and transfer the risk to prior insurers. Such a system runs\n   counter to the principles of fairness and justice enunciated in\n   <em>\n    Owens-Illinois\n   </em>\n   and those underlying our tort law. Other courts have also acknowledged the absurdity of applying the unavailability exception to actors like Bendix.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    R.T. Vanderbilt Co. v.

Justice O'Hern-the author of\n   <em>\n    Owens-Illinois\n   </em>\n   -reminds us that corporate actors should \"know that if they do not transfer to insurance companies the risk of their activities that cause continuous and progressive injury, they may bear that untransferred risk.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1372879\" index=\"200\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj/138/437/#p454\">\n    138 N.J. at 473\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1372879\" index=\"201\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj/138/437/#p454\">\n    650 A.2d 974\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-202\">\n   The unavailability exception, as applied by the majority, removes Bendix's corporate accountability as a self-insurer for those workers first exposed to Bendix asbestos products before 1987 and\n   in the fourteen years that it continued to manufacture its dangerous products. By diluting Bendix's responsibility as a self-insurer, the majority's decision fails not only to deter corporate risk-taking at the expense of public health, but rather gives an incentive to such risk-taking because there is no full financial reckoning for continued bad behavior. By holding companies accountable for their irresponsible conduct, tort law has a salutary deterrent effect. Although the dominant force motivating most companies is to increase profits, one of the major purposes of the common law is to promote the public health and welfare of our citizens.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-203\">\n   The majority's decision also interferes with the natural flow of market forces, which, if left untouched, would advantage the public. When insurance carriers no longer provide coverage for the continued manufacture of a product endangering the public health because of the prospect of financially ruinous lawsuits, the marketplace is making a definitive statement that whatever good the product offers is outweighed by the risk. Under such circumstances, the natural course of events might lead the company to abandon the manufacture of the dangerous product.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-204\">\n   But, if insurance carriers that previously provided coverage for the product must-by the fiat of the Court-insure the risk against their will, then corporations can send their potentially deadly wares into the stream of commerce knowing that they will not bear the full risk in doing so. The perverse logic of this scheme is evident here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-205\">\n   Bendix continued to manufacture asbestos-containing brake and clutch pads for fourteen years after insurance was no longer available. For fourteen years, workers exposed to asbestos fibers before 1987 remained exposed to the potentially deadly toxin, increasing their risk of contracting various serious and lethal diseases. Yet, Bendix now gets-and future similarly situated companies will get-a windfall bailout because this Court has conscripted insurance carriers into paying the bill.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-206\">\n   The\n   <em>\n    Owens-Illinois\n   </em>\n   Court had in mind an equitable allocation formula-not the twisted one that has taken root from a single\n   difficult-to-decipher clause in an opinion intended to promote the public welfare.
