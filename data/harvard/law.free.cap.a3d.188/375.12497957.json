We therefore reverse.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Bowser was the sole witness in the hearing before the Administrative Law Judge (ALJ). Her testimony was undisputed. Bowser was a fourteen-year veteran of the Mercer County Corrections department when the accident occurred. On the day of the accident, she had worked her assigned 11:00 p.m. to 7:00 a.m. shift overseeing inmates in a housing unit. During that shift, her commander told her she had to work another eight-hour shift on a detention floor, starting at 7:00 a.m., because another officer \"called out.\" At about 7:30 a.m., Bowser asked a fellow officer on\n   the detention floor to cover for her, as she would if she had to use the restroom. Bowser needed to run to her car to retrieve feminine hygiene products because she was menstruating. As with a bathroom break, Bowser did not \"clock out\" when she went to her car, and was paid for the break time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Her car was parked on the MCCC grounds, in an area reserved for corrections officers. On the way to her car, while walking near an internal service road on MCCC grounds, she slipped on black ice and fell. She was about fifteen to twenty feet from the jail. Another officer who happened to be arriving helped her get up. She continued to her car, then returned to the building, went to the restroom, and \"got [herself] back together.\" Fifteen or twenty minutes later, her commander relieved\n   her for the day, as someone arrived to perform the shift.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The Board stipulated that Bowser was totally and permanently disabled from performing her regular and assigned job duties. It also stipulated that her disability directly resulted from her fall, and her fall did not result from her willful negligence. In his proposed decision, the ALJ found that Bowser's injury was undesigned and unexpected, and it occurred \"during and as a result of the performance of [her] regular or assigned duties.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   N.J.S.A. 43:16A-7(1). In so doing, the ALJ rejected the Board's initial position to the contrary on both points.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In sum, the ALJ found that Bowser met the five requirements for receiving an accidental disability pension, which the Court identified in\n   <em>\n    Richardson v.

The Board premised its analysis on the Court's statement in\n   <em>\n    Kasper\n   </em>\n   that an employee \"must be engaged in his or her employment duties on property owned or controlled by the employer in order to qualify for an accidental disability pension.\"\n   <em>\n    Kasper\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1071570\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj/164/564/\">\n    164 N.J. at 581\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1071570,1071580,1071541\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/754/525/\">\n    754 A.2d 525\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Board relied on two unpublished decisions in which our court upheld the denial of accidental disability pensions to public employees who suffered disabling injuries in parking lots. Recognizing those decisions involved employees coming to, or going from work, the Board nonetheless concluded that an employee parking lot \"is not considered the employer's premises under\n   <em>\n    Kasper\n   </em>\n   .\" Therefore, Bowser's injury on the way to the parking lot did not occur \"during and as a result of her regular or assigned duty.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   This appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   We will sustain an administrative agency's quasi-judicial decision, as the Board made here, \"unless there is a clear showing that it is arbitrary, capricious, or unreasonable, or that it lacks fair support in the record.\"\n   <em>\n    Russo v.

A public employee injured as a result of a traumatic event while shoveling an employer's parking lot as part of his or her maintenance job satisfies the requirement to show the injury occurred \"during and as a result of the performance of his [or her] regular or assigned duties.\" N.J.S.A. 43:16A-7(1). Likewise, a physical education teacher, injured as a result of a traumatic event while running into the parking lot to retrieve an errant soccer ball during a gym class would satisfy the statute. The result depends on the employee's use of the parking lot. We do not presume that every post-commute parking lot accident is covered. Nor shall we attempt to formulate a rule for cases not before us.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Here, Bowser suffered a disabling accidental injury during her workday, at the work location. We recognize that Bowser did not leave the jail on her way to the parking lot in order to\n   perform assigned duties. She does not contend she performed security, or inmate supervision in the parking lot. However, she entered the parking and road area within the confines of the MCCC property to retrieve necessary feminine hygiene products from her car because she was, unexpectedly, working a second eight-hour shift.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Just as restroom breaks at the work location during the workday \"are necessary concomitants of an employee's performance of his or her regularly assigned tasks,\"\n   <em>\n    Kasper\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1071570\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj/164/564/\">\n    164 N.J. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   586 n.7,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1071570,1071580,1071541\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/754/525/\">\n    754 A.2d 525\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , so was Bowser's break to retrieve those necessary products. She remained on the MCCC premises, and had no intention of leaving. She obtained relief from a fellow officer so she could briefly leave her post, as she would if she had headed straight to the restroom. And, she was \"on the clock,\" as she would be during a restroom break. Consequently, her accident occurred \"during and as a result of the performance of [her] regular or assigned duties.\" N.J.S.A. 43:16A-7(1). As the Board conceded she satisfied the remaining\n   <em>\n    Richardson\n   </em>\n   factors, the Board erred in denying Bowser an accidental disability pension.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Reversed.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-44\">\n    We acknowledge that unpublished decisions of our court have not taken a uniform approach to accidents in parking lots and other areas outside a building where a public employee generally performs assigned duties.
