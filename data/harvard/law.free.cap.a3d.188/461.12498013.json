Krasinski (the Estate) through its executor, Edward Krasinski (Edward or the Executor), appeals from the order entered on July 16, 2015, which granted in part and denied in part exceptions to the order confirming the first and final account of the Estate. Patricia Krasinski-Dunzik (Patricia) also appeals from that order. Upon review, we affirm in part, vacate in part, and remand for proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     I. Background\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   This matter arises from a dispute among siblings over the distribution of the real property from the Estate of their mother, Sophia M. Krasinski (the Decedent). The Decedent had four children: Patricia, who is married to Gary Dunzik (Gary) (collectively, the Dunziks); Eleanor J. Krasinski (Eleanor); James P. Krasinski (James); and Edward.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Decedent died testate on November 4, 2006, and the Will was probated and an Estate opened in 2007. Pursuant to the terms of her will, Edward was named as executor of the Estate and granted letters testamentary. The will directed that the Decedent's debts and funeral expenses be paid from the assets of the Estate, and that the residue of the Estate be left in equal shares to the Decedent's four children.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The primary assets of the Estate included three parcels of real estate.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Those parcels were: 1) 20 acres of property with an appraised value of $55,000 (Johnny Hoover Place);\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   2) a barn and 95 acres of property, which includes 68 acres of coal rights, with an appraised value of $230,000 (Wicks' Place);\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   and 3) a house, buildings,\n   and 98.84 acres with an appraised value of $200,000 (Homestead Place).\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On July 7, 2010, Edward, in his capacity as Executor of the Estate, filed a petition to permit the private sale of real estate to heirs. In that petition, Edward averred that Patricia was objecting to the distribution of all three properties because it was her position she already owns all of them based on a prior oral agreement between herself and the Decedent. After argument and briefing, on March 22, 2011, the orphans' court granted the Executor's petition to permit private sale of the real estate. Specifically, the orphans' court concluded that Patricia did not produce a writing to satisfy the requirements of the statute of frauds to prove that she owned these properties. The orphans' court also concluded that Patricia did not present sufficient evidence to remove the purported oral contract from the statute of frauds.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Prior to the sale, on February 8, 2013, letters were sent by the Estate's attorney to all four heirs explaining the process by which the sale would occur.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Included in this letter was a statement indicating that if the Dunziks did not purchase all of the property of Homestead Place, there would be steps taken to ensure they could maintain ownership of the home and barn on the property.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   Plaintiff's Exhibit 30 (Estate's Attorney's Letter, 2/8/2013).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The private sale was conducted on February 15, 2013. Edward, James, and Patricia attended the sale.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Patricia did not bid on any of the properties. James and his wife, Marie, bid $230,000 for Wicks' Place. Edward bid $55,000 for Johnny Hoover Place. Edward, James, and Marie jointly bid $120,000 for Homestead Place.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On March 7, 2013, the Executor petitioned the orphans' court to approve the sale of these properties to the residuary heirs for these amounts. Contrary to the letter of the Estate's attorney, no provision for Patricia and her husband's ownership of the house and barn at Homestead Place was included in the deeds. On March 14, 2013, Patricia filed\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   an objection to\n   the petition.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   On April 30, 2013, after argument, the orphans' court approved the Executor's petition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   On May 30, 2014, the Executor filed a first and final account. Patricia, through counsel, filed six objections. Those objections challenged: 1) the manner in which the private sale was conducted; 2) the failure to include a limiting condition regarding the Dunziks' home and barn and underlying land in the Homestead Place deed; 3) the proposal to sell Homestead Place with a right-of-way from Johnny Hoover Place; 4) the appraised values of the properties as either suppressed or inflated; and 5) tax implications related to the Executor's report to the Internal Revenue Service that Patricia sold her interest in the land, and the Executor's date of death valuation of the real estate. Objection No. 6 was a series of miscellaneous objections, and is discussed in section III,\n   <em>\n    infra\n   </em>\n   , as that objection relates solely to the Executor's appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   A hearing was held on all objections on September 5, 2014. Testimony and evidence were sparse at this hearing and the majority of the testimony did not relate to the objections filed by the Dunziks. Furthermore, Patricia did not appear; however, both her husband, Gary, and the Dunziks' attorney appeared.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   On September 10, 2014, the orphans' court ordered Patricia to file a brief within 30 days, and also provided the Executor 20 days thereafter to respond. Patricia did not file a brief, but the Executor filed answers to the objections on October 27, 2014.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   On April 22, 2015, the orphans' court entered an order and opinion in this matter. The orphans' court sustained, in part, Objection No. 6, finding that natural gas payments received by the Estate for Homestead Place in the amount of $39,536.00 were the property of Patricia and not the Estate, and directed the filing of an Amended Account to remove the $39,536.00 from the Estate. The orphans' court overruled the remaining objections. With respect to Objection Nos. 1 through 4, concerning the private sale of the properties, the orphans' court concluded these issues were waived because they should have been raised in an appeal from the order confirming the private sale on April 30, 2013, pursuant to Pennsylvania Rule of Appellate Procedure 342(a)(6) (order \"determining an interest in real ... property\" appealable as of right). As to Objection No. 5, tax ramifications, the orphans' court concluded that the Executor acted appropriately.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   On May 4, 2015, Patricia filed a motion for reconsideration, contending,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , the April 30, 2013 order approving the private sale was interlocutory; the Executor and James and his wife removed a significant amount of timber from Homestead Place; the party who sold the Decedent's real estate was the Executor, and not Patricia; and seeking a revised account that properly reflected the value of the land on the date of the Decedent's death as the appraised value, and retraction of improper tax filing.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   On May 13, 2015, the\n   orphans' court granted Patricia's motion for reconsideration and set argument on two issues. Those issues included: 1) whether the April 30, 2013 order was a final order, and 2) whether the value of timber removed from the property was included properly in the account.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   Order, 5/13/2015. By order entered July 16, 2015, the orphans' court rescinded the May 13, 2015, order, construed Patricia's motion for reconsideration as exceptions, and dismissed those exceptions.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   The orphans' court also dismissed the exceptions filed by the Executor concerning ownership of the gas and oil rights to Homestead Place.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The Executor timely filed a notice of appeal, and Patricia filed a cross appeal.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   A divided panel of this Court affirmed the orphans' court's order in part, vacated in part, and remanded for further proceedings. Thereafter, Patricia sought\n   <em>\n    en banc\n   </em>\n   review, which this Court granted. The matter is now ready for our disposition.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   In considering both appeals, we bear in mind our well-settled standard of review.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   The [o]rphans' [c]ourt decision will not be reversed unless there has been an abuse of discretion or a fundamental error in applying the correct principles of law. This Court's standard of review of questions of law is\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   , and the scope of review is plenary, as we may review the entire record in making our determination. When we review questions of law, our standard of review is limited to determining whether the [orphans'] court committed an error of law.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     In re Fiedler\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6822912\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/132/1010/6822912/#p1018\">\n    132 A.3d 1010\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1018 (Pa.

Patricia's Appeal\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   We first consider Patricia's arguments related to the private sale of property that occurred on February 15, 2013. She argues that the orphans' court erred in permitting the private sale that only allowed the heirs to participate in the bidding because it \"was never intended to and did not, in fact, maximize the value of the real estate for the benefit of all of the heirs[.]\" Patricia's Brief at 13. Patricia also argues that she was not given adequate notice of the sale.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   at 15. Patricia further contends that there was no need for the Executor to offer Homestead Place for sale with a right of way in favor of Johnny Hoover Place, except to serve as an impediment and deterrent to her and her husband's purchase of Homestead Place.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   at 16-17. Patricia also argues that James and Edward \"changed[d] the terms of the sale\" of Homestead Place by failing to recognize ownership by Patricia and her husband of the home and barn, the lands\n   underlying the home and barn, and the appurtenant facilities servicing them in the deed.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   at 18.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The orphans' court concluded that Patricia waived these issues by failing to appeal from the April 30, 2013 order confirming and approving the private sale, as required by Pennsylvania Rule of Appellate Procedure 342.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   Orphans' Court Opinion, 4/22/2015, at 8,\n   <em>\n    citing\n   </em>\n   Pa.R.A.P. 342(a)(6) and (c). As more fully discussed below, we agree with the orphans' court's determination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Effective February 12, 2012, Pa.R.A.P. 342 provides, in relevant part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   (a) General rule.

The private sale took place on February 15, 2013. Thereafter, on April 30, 2013, the orphans' court approved the sale and ordered the properties conveyed to the grantees.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   Order, 4/30/2013.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   By way of background to the adoption of current Rule 342, we begin with the Pennsylvania Supreme Court's decision in\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     In re Estate of Stricker\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4195359\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/pa/602/54/\">\n    602 Pa. 54\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7297296,4195359\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/977/1115/\">\n    977 A.2d 1115\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2009), which involved the\n   <strong>\n    prior\n   </strong>\n   version of Rule 342. In\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Stricker\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   , our Supreme Court held that an orphans' court's order directing the co-executors to sell the estate's real estate was an interlocutory order that was not appealable under Rule 342 or Rule 313 (collateral order). At that time, under Rule 342, the determination of the finality of an order \"making a distribution, or determining an interest in realty\n   or personalty or the status of individuals or entities\" was left to the discretion of the orphans' court.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Stricker\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   , at 1117-1118. Because the orphans' court judge had not certified the order to sell the estate's real estate as final, the\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Stricker\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   Court ruled the order was not appealable under Rule 342. The\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Stricker\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   Court further determined the order did not qualify as a collateral order appealable pursuant to Rule 313. Therefore, the order of this Court quashing the appeal was affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   In a concurring opinion, Mr. Justice Saylor wrote:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   The majority aptly observes that our Rules of Appellate Procedure contain a vehicle to address the particularized concerns arising from orders determining interests in estate property. Specifically, Rule 342 permits an appeal from a distribution order or an order determining an interest in estate property to proceed as of right,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , upon a determination of finality by the orphans' court.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   Pa.R.A.P. 342(1). The majority correctly interprets the rule as investing absolute, largely standardless discretion in the orphans' court. I differ, however, with the majority's categorical assessment regarding the wisdom of the rule in this regard.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   Majority Opinion at 58-60,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7297296,4195359\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/977/1115/\">\n    977 A.2d at 1118\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   In my view, there are substantial arguments to be made that estate administration would be better served by a rule providing for the general appealability of estate-related orders determining property interests at least in the real property setting. Notably, the present \"determination of finality\" procedure does not closely align with the justifications for permitting immediate appeals (facilitating the prompt resolution of potential title disputes to benefit purchasers, the estate, and beneficiaries). Further, the vesting of absolute, standardless discretion in our orphans' courts yields the potential for disparate treatment....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   * * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   ... Thus, I believe our Appellate and Orphans' Court Procedural Rules Committees should continue to study the application of the present rule in practice and make recommendations for improvements where appropriate, particularly given the troubling implications of maintaining a system based on absolute, largely standardless discretion.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7297296,4195359\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/977/1115/\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7297296,4195359\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/977/1115/\">\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </strong>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7297296,4195359\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/977/1115/\">\n    at 1120-1121\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Saylor, J., concurring).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Thereafter, Rule 342 was revised, effective February 12, 2012.

The Comment to Rule 342 states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   [I]t is difficult to analogize civil litigation to litigation arising in estate, trust and guardianship administration. The civil proceeding defines the scope of the dispute, but the administration of a trust or estate does not define the scope of the litigation in Orphans' Court. Administration of a trust or an estate continues over a period of time. Litigation in Orphans' Court may arise at some point during the administration, and when it does arise, the dispute needs to be determined promptly and with finality so that the guardianship or the estate or trust administration can then continue properly and orderly. Thus, the traditional notions of finality that are applicable in the context of ongoing civil adversarial proceedings do not correspond to litigation in Orphans' Court.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   In order to facilitate orderly administration of estates, trusts and guardianships, the 2011 amendments list certain orders that will be immediately appealable without any requirement that the Orphans' Court make a determination of finality. Orders falling within subdivisions (a)(1)-(7) no longer require the lower court to make a determination of finality.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   Subdivisions (a)(1)-(7) list orders that are unique to Orphans' Court practice, but closely resemble final orders as defined in Rule 341(b).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Pa.R.A.P. 342, Comment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Here, the private sale occurred on February 15, 2013, having been authorized by the orphans' court's March 22, 2011 order. On March 7, 2013, the Executor filed a Report and Return of Private Sale (Report), seeking court approval of the private sale. The Report attached fiduciary deeds for the properties as Exhibits \"1\", \"2\" and \"3\". The Executor's fiduciary deed for Homestead Place contained\n   <strong>\n    NO\n   </strong>\n   provision regarding the Dunzik's ownership of the house and barn, underlying land, and appurtenances. The April 30, 2013 order finalized the sale of the real estate by the Executor and approved the fiduciary deeds attached to the Report as Exhibits 1, 2, and 3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Significantly, the orphans' court's April 30, 2013, order explicitly directs that \"the Report of Edward P. Krasinski, Executor of the estate of the above Decedent, is hereby approved in all regards and the properties described in Exhibits 1, 2 and 3 of said Report shall be conveyed to the grantees in accordance with the terms set out in the Report.\" Order, 4/30/2013. As such, the order clearly \"determines an interest in real ... property.\" Pa.R.A.P. 342(a)(6). Consequently, the orphans' court's April 30, 2013, order was appealable as of right pursuant to Rule 342. Although Patricia filed\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   objections, as the orphans' court noted, she \"did not raise the appropriate issues in her\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   objections,\" and the private sale was confirmed. Orphans' Court Opinion, 4/22/2015, at 10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Furthermore, Patricia had challenged ownership of the properties in a civil action that caused the court to issue a stay on the Executor's sale of the properties. The civil suit resulted in the trial court's December 24, 2012, determination that there was no oral agreement upon which Patricia could base her claim of ownership of the properties. This Order was never appealed.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   Footnote 5,\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7297296,4195359\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/977/1115/\">\n      supra\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   . Therefore, it is evident that Patricia was aware that her claims of ownership to the properties would be lost upon sale of the properties.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   When the orphans' court entered its April 30, 2013, order, approving the private sale and the fiduciary deeds, Patricia\n   lost her claims of ownership in Homestead Place and the other properties. Therefore, as the orphans' court correctly determined, Patricia's failure to appeal the April 30, 2013 order pursuant to Rule 342(a)(6) resulted in waiver.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   Pa.R.A.P. 342(c).

As such, the Estate was responsible for the taxable gain from the private sale,\n   and Patricia is entitled to relief on this basis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   Next, Patricia argues that the Executor did not properly value the properties on the date of death of the Decedent, which resulted in unrealistic appreciation and capital gains. Here, the Executor used the real estate tax assessment value and a factor called the common level ratio to establish minimal values of the real estate interests on the date of the Decedent's death. Patricia points out \"the Executor sold four (4) tracts of land, in fee, for a total consideration of $405,000.00, and experienced a 'gain' in value of $321,620.79 (nearly 500%) over the $83,379.00 reported.\" Patricia's Brief at 31.

The Executor's Pennsylvania inheritance tax return, which used the real estate tax assessment value and the common level ratio to establish the date of death values, was \"accepted as filed\" by the Pennsylvania Department of Revenue.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   Commonwealth of Pennsylvania Department of Revenue Notice of Inheritance Tax Appraisement, Allowance or Disallowance of Deductions and Assessment of Tax, 6/22/2009. Therefore, Patricia's argument that the Executor's method of determining the value of the real estate on the date of death was \"grossly flawed\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n   is unavailing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   Finally, while Patricia also argues that the properties were overvalued or undervalued in the appraisals, any issue as to valuation relates to the private sale that was approved by the April 30, 2013 order. Because we have determined,\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     supra\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   , that order was an appealable order, Patricia has waived this aspect of her claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   In sum, we reverse Paragraph 3 of the orphans' court's July 16, 2015 order, to the extent that it dismissed Patricia's exceptions that sought relief on her claim that the Estate, and not Patricia, was responsible for the taxable gain from the private sale. The remaining claims have been waived or warrant no relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     III. The Estate's Objections\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   We now turn to the issues raised by the Estate and provide the following background. Contained within Patricia's sixth objection to the first and final account was the following:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-85\">\n   41. [Edward] has received and improperly withheld from [Patricia] revenues related to gas exploration and leasing in the approximate amount of $40,000.00 related to the oil and gas\n   contained within and underlying [Homestead Place].\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-86\">\n   42. [Patricia] is the owner of the oil &amp; gas interest underlying [Homestead Place], by virtue of a deed from Edith Nearhood, dated July 9, 2002, and recorded as Instrument No. 200211242.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   Objections to First and Final Account, 7/3/2014, at \u00b6\u00b6 41-42.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   In sustaining this objection, ruling in favor of Patricia, and ordering the Executor to pay Patricia $39,536, the orphans' court stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-89\">\n   [The aforementioned objection] claims that [Edward] improperly withheld gas monies in the amount of $40,000.00 relating to [Homestead Place]. It states therein that [Patricia] is the actual owner of oil and gas interests underlying [Homestead Place] by virtue of a deed recorded in Clearfield County as Instrument No. 200211242. This deed was not offered as an exhibit at [the] time of [the] non-jury trial. Following the non-jury trial and receipt of briefs, while preparing the court's opinion, the undersigned went to the recorder of deeds office and obtained a copy of [the deed which Patricia references]. The court hereby takes judicial notice of the deed, and the court has caused it to be filed with the record for potential appellate review. This 2002 deed is from Edith Nearhood as grantor, to [Patricia] as grantee. The deed describes a parcel of 96 acres and one hundred and eight perches in Cooper Township, Clearfield County, with Tax Map number 110-R7-9, and purports to convey coal, gas and oil, and other subsurface rights to [Patricia]. [Homestead Place] in the case at bar is identified with tax map number 110-R7-9.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-90\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-91\">\n   This court can find no testimony from the non-jury trial where this issue, being [Patricia's] claim that she is the full and complete owner of the oil and gas interests under this tract, was discussed. In fact, no evidence was submitted by either party.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-92\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-93\">\n   A close examination of the first and final account shows on page 9 under \"Other Income\" the gas lease payments. By far, most of the payments are from [Homestead Place]. (A total of $39,536.00). On page 3 under \"Receipts of Principal\" the Estate lists its assets; [Homestead Place] is number 4 under the \"Real Estate\" heading. It is described as \"House, buildings, and 98.84 acres (\n   <strong>\n    less 96 A of coal, minerals, gas &amp; oil\n   </strong>\n   )....\" (Emphasis added). The same exclusion of sub-surface rights [appears in other exhibits]. The court, in trying to analyze this mishmash, wondered if perhaps the sale of [Homestead Place] was not to include the oil and gas rights such that the same could be retained in the Estate for the future benefit of all heirs. However, a review of the documents describing the terms of the private sale provides no reference whatsoever to any oil, gas or other sub-surface rights as to [Homestead Place].\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-94\">\n   [ ] Exhibit 27 is a copy of the memorandum of lease dated September 15, 2009 wherein [Edward, as executor of the Estate,] confirms the Estate has entered into a gas lease (or consultant agreement) with Long Consulting Group. This is clearly referring to [Homestead Place,] as the property subject to the lease is described as Tax Parcel No. 110-R07-9, 98.84 acres and in Cooper Township. The court wonders how the executor can enter into a gas lease on a property which the first and final account (and the inheritance tax return) clearly indicates that the oil and\n   gas rights are excluded. (at least 96 acres thereof).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-95\">\n   Based upon a substantial lack of information and a severely inadequate record, the court must decide if the Estate properly accounted for the gas royalties from [Homestead Place]. The court boils it down to the following. [Patricia] has a deed purporting to convey to her all sub-surface rights beneath the Homestead surface. The Estate in its Inheritance Tax return and first and final account clearly indicates it does not own 96 acres of oil, gas and other sub-surface rights below the Homestead [Place] surface. The court finds [Patricia] has met her burden of proof and finds the Estate erred by including Homestead [Place] gas royalties in the amount of $39,536.00 as an Estate asset. These monies will be paid to [Patricia] and removed from the Estate assets.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   Orphans' Court Opinion, 4/22/2015, at 17-19 (unnecessary capitalization and some citations omitted omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   Based on the foregoing, the orphans' court sustained Patricia's Objection No. 6, paragraphs 41 and 42, and required the Executor to pay Patricia $39,536. The Executor filed exceptions, arguing that Patricia was not the owner of the sub-surface estate at issue, and the orphans' court erred by granting Patricia compensation on this basis. The Executor also contended that Edith Nearhood never owned the sub-surface estate and that any deed she granted could not have conveyed what she did not own.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   On July 16, 2015, the orphans' court dismissed the Executor's exceptions, concluding that the Estate \"has attempted to introduce facts and documents not of record in the present matter\" in support of its dismissal. Order, 7/16/2015, at \u00b6 1. This issue is the basis of the Estate's appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   The Executor first contends that the orphans' court erred by purporting to take judicial notice of the Nearhood deed, then giving it conclusive effect, and thereby sustaining Patricia's objections related to the oil and gas payments. Estate's Brief at 12-16.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-100\">\n   Pa.R.E. 201(b) governs judicial notice of adjudicative facts. The rule states: \"A judicially noticed fact must be one not subject to reasonable dispute in that it is either (1) generally known within the territorial jurisdiction of the trial court or (2) capable of accurate and ready determination by resort to sources whose accuracy cannot reasonably be questioned.\" Pa.R.E. 201(b). A court may take judicial notice of an indisputable adjudicative fact. A fact is indisputable if it is so well established as to be a matter of common knowledge. Judicial notice is intended to avoid the formal introduction of evidence in limited circumstances where the fact sought to be proved is so well known that evidence in support thereof is unnecessary.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Kinley v.

However, the rule provides that \"[o]n timely request, a party is entitled to be heard on the propriety of taking judicial notice and the nature of the fact to be noticed. If the court takes judicial notice before notifying a party, the party, on request, is still entitled to be heard.\" Pa.R.E. 201(e).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   Instantly, the Executor became aware of the orphans' court's decision to take judicial\n   notice when it filed its opinion on April 22, 2015. The Executor timely filed exceptions contesting the implications of the deed on May 12, 2015. However, the orphans' court dismissed these exceptions on the basis that \"the record has previously closed.\" Order, 7/16/2015. Thus, it is clear that the Executor did not have the opportunity to be heard. Where, as here, a party has made a timely request to be heard after learning of the judicial notice, the orphans' court was obliged to entertain it. Pa.R.E. 201(e).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   In this case, the need was even more apparent where the orphans' court took judicial notice without any request by Patricia or notice to any party. The orphans' court then went on to offer a series of factual conclusions on this basis. The Nearhood deed may or may not be a valid deed to the property. However, the orphans' court should leave it to Patricia and the Executor to litigate that issue. Accordingly, we vacate Paragraph 1 of the orphans' court's July 16, 2015 order, dismissing the Estate's exceptions, and we remand to the orphans' court to conduct a hearing on this objection. At that hearing, the burden is on Patricia, as the party objecting to the first and final account, to present evidence of her right to those oil and gas payments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   In conclusion, based upon the above discussion concerning the appeals of Patricia and the Estate, we affirm the orphans' court's July 16, 2015, order in part, reverse in part, vacate in part, and remand for proceedings consistent with this Opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   Order affirmed in part, reversed in part, vacated in part, and remanded for further proceedings consistent with this Opinion.

Therefore, we quash this matter.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-128\">\n   In reaching our result, we are mindful that the Rules of Appellate Procedure addressing the appealability of Orphans' Court orders have changed somewhat since\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Stricker\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   was decided. At the time of\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Stricker\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   , Pa.R.A.P. 342 indicated,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , that an order determining an interest in realty would be immediately appealable upon a determination of finality by an Orphans' Court. Effective February 13, 2012, the Supreme Court deleted from Rule 342 the provision concerning the ability of an Orphans' Court to make determinations of finality and, instead, listed various orders that would be immediately appealable.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   Pa.R.A.P. 342(a). Among the orders listed in Rule 342 is an order determining an interest in real property. Pa.R.A.P. 342(a)(6).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-129\">\n   We do not believe the order before us is one of the appealable orders set forth by Rule 342, whether in Subsection (6) or otherwise.

We understand the effect of the instant order will be to allow the realty sale and, if the administratrix sells the tracts, Fetter will come to own them. Thus, if the sale is completed, the order will eventually lead to a change in the ownership interest of the realty.\n   <strong>\n    Nevertheless, the Orphans' Court decision now on appeal did not involve the court having to resolve some dispute about who had or has an interest in the tracts: The estate obviously owns them. The court's decision was about whether the administratrix should be required to encumber one tract with an easement and about the propriety of her plan to reduce the estate assets to cash by sale to a particular party, the goal being to distribute the sale proceeds in accordance with the will. The court's decision was not about determining an interest in the subject realty.

Like the decedent in\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Ash\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   , Sophia owned three parcels (\"the Property\") that she did not specifically devise to her children. Also like the decedent in\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Ash\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   , Sophia provided that the residue of the estate, including the Property, was to be divided equally among her four children. Last Will and Testament, 8/18/99, at Item II. With that goal in mind, Sophia's executor filed a petition to permit the private sale of the Property in July of 2010. Appellant objected to the sale, claiming an ownership interest in the Property based on an oral agreement she had with Sophia. The orphans' court determined\n   that Appellant did not have an ownership interest in the Property and granted permission for a private sale. Order, 3/22/11. Pursuant to Pa.R.A.P. 342(a)(6), Appellant could have appealed that decision because it determined an interest in property, but she did not. Rather, she filed a civil complaint against the Estate, which the trial court dismissed after finding no oral contract existed between Sophia and Appellant. Order, 12/24/12.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-132\">\n   After the private sale of the Property on February 15, 2013, Sophia's executor petitioned for approval of the sale. Over Appellant's objections, the orphans' court granted the petition. Order, 4/30/13. Thus, as in\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Ash\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   , the purpose of the April 30, 2013 order was not to resolve some dispute about who had an interest in the Property; that issue was determined in favor of the Estate prior to the private sale. Order, 3/22/11; Order, 12/24/12. Rather, the April 30, 2013 order was about approving the executor's \"plan to reduce the estate assets to cash by sale to a particular party, the goal being to distribute the sale proceeds in accordance with the will.\"\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Ash\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7307516\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/73/1287/#p1290\">\n    73 A.3d at 1290\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .
