The arbitrator dismissed the January 26, 2015 charges, invoking the ECD in determining it would be \"a denial of fundamental fairness to force [Yarborough] to defend ... an action regarding the identical facts [as in the October 9, 2014 matter] which would deny him of his position a second time.\" While the ECD's \"application requires, as a matter of first principle, that the party whose claim is being sought to be barred must have had a fair and reasonable opportunity to have fully litigated that claim in the original action,\"\n   <em>\n    Cafferata v.

As Judge Thomas R. Vena noted in his written decision, the arbitrator's comprehensive findings of fact, crediting the testimony of the school principal as to both incidents of corporal punishment, well supported the conduct-unbecoming charge.
