Murphy, appeals from the judgment of the trial court denying his postjudgment motion, as amended, to modify the judgment rendered in the parties' dissolution action. In that motion he sought, pursuant to paragraph 12 (d) of the parties' separation agreement, which was incorporated into the judgment, to terminate his alimony obligation to the defendant, Jamie R. Murphy, because of her alleged cohabitation with her boyfriend. On appeal, the plaintiff claims that the court applied an improper legal standard as a prerequisite for the termination of alimony under General Statutes \u00a7 46b-86 (b). We agree and, accordingly, reverse the judgment of the court and remand the case for further proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   The following facts and procedural history are relevant to this appeal. The marriage of the parties was dissolved on March 12, 2012. The court accepted and incorporated the terms of the parties' separation agreement into the judgment. Paragraph 12 (d) of the separation agreement provided that the plaintiff pay periodic alimony to the defendant in the amount of $400\n   per month until July, 2016,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   nonmodifiable as to amount and duration, subject, however, to the condition\n   that alimony would terminate on the earlier of the (a) death of the plaintiff, (b) death of the defendant, (c) remarriage of the defendant, or (d) cohabitation by the defendant as defined by \u00a7 46b-86 (b).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Following the dissolution, the defendant rented a condominium on Sunfield Drive in South Windsor. She paid approximately $1640 per month for rent and utilities. In December, 2014, the defendant and her children left the condominium and moved into her boyfriend's residence in Bloomfield (Bloomfield residence). The defendant paid her boyfriend $800 per month toward his rent and other housing expenses. She continued to pay her personal expenses and the expenses she incurred for the parties' minor children.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   After learning that the defendant had moved into the Bloomfield residence, the plaintiff filed several motions, including the postjudgment motion, as amended, to modify the judgment by terminating his alimony obligation pursuant to paragraph 12 (d) of the separation agreement.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   In that motion, the plaintiff alleged that the\n   defendant had relocated to Bloomfield where she was living with her boyfriend and that the new living arrangements resulted in a change in circumstances so as to alter the financial needs of the defendant, i.e., a change in circumstances that was sufficient to satisfy the financial requirement of \u00a7 46b-86 (b) for termination of alimony.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On April 21, 2015, the motion appeared on the court's docket, and the parties entered into a written stipulation that the court accepted. The stipulation provided, in relevant part, that \"[i]f [the defendant did] not return to South Windsor on or before August 15, 2015, then the issue of cohabitation and [the plaintiff's] claim to modify/terminate alimony [would] be addressed in mid-September, 2015. Further, if [the defendant] cohabitate[d] in South Windsor the issue of cohabitation [would] also be addressed in mid-September, 2015.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   At the hearing, the plaintiff's counsel further explained that \"[i]f [the defendant] resumes living in South Windsor and leaves the residence where we're claiming that she's residing with her [boyfriend], then the issue of cohabitation ... [is] not a major issue and will likely be done with. If [the defendant] returns with her [boyfriend] to South Windsor, or if she does not return to South Windsor and stays in Bloomfield with her [boyfriend], we're going to come back in mid-September and deal with cohabitation.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On August 14, 2015, as a result of the parties' stipulation, the defendant executed a lease for another residence in South Windsor (South Windsor residence). Although the defendant's boyfriend cosigned\n   the lease, it provided that only the defendant and the parties' two children would occupy that residence. The defendant moved into that residence on October 1, 2015.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   At the plaintiff's request, the court subsequently scheduled a hearing on the plaintiff's amended postjudgment motion seeking termination of his alimony\n   obligation. The hearing took place over two days in January and February, 2016, during which the court,\n   <em>\n    Bozzuto\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    J.\n   </em>\n   , heard testimony and admitted into evidence various exhibits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Following the hearing, the court denied the plaintiff's motion. The court found that, although it was clear that the defendant was living with her boyfriend for a period of time at the Bloomfield residence, it was not clear whether her boyfriend \"contributed to her support at all, much less to such an extent that the living arrangements caused such a change of circumstances as to alter the financial needs of the defendant.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   With respect to the period of time after the defendant moved from the Bloomfield residence to the South Windsor residence, the court found that \"the record [was] devoid of reliable or probative evidence that the boyfriend contribute[d] financial support to the defendant.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   The court therefore concluded that the evidence did not support a finding of cohabitation either at the Bloomfield residence or the South Windsor residence, and declined to terminate the plaintiff's alimony obligation to the defendant. This appeal followed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On appeal, the plaintiff claims that the court improperly concluded that he had to establish a change in the defendant's financial needs pursuant to \u00a7 46b-86 (b) on the basis of her boyfriend's financial contributions to her support during the period of alleged cohabitation at the Bloomfield residence, rather than due to the defendant's altered financial needs as a result of a reduction in her expenses during that period of time. We agree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Section 46b-86 (b) provides, in relevant part, that \"the Superior Court may, in its discretion and upon notice and hearing ... terminate the payment of periodic alimony upon a showing that the party receiving the periodic alimony is living with another person under circumstances which the court finds should result in the ... termination of alimony because the living arrangements cause such a change of circumstances as to alter the financial needs of that party....\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \"[U]nder \u00a7 46b-86 (b), a finding of cohabitation requires that (1) the alimony recipient was living with another person and (2) the living arrangement caused a change of circumstances so as to alter the financial needs of the alimony recipient.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    Spencer\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Spencer\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12491401\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/173/1/#p515\">\n    177 Conn.

In fact, most of this court's decisions applying \u00a7 46b-86 (b) do so in the context of the boyfriend (or other person) providing financial support to the alimony recipient, whether the boyfriend moves in with the alimony recipient, or the alimony recipient moves in with the boyfriend, as those are the usual fact patterns. Section 46b-86 (b), however, provides that \"the Superior Court may, in its discretion and upon notice and hearing ... terminate the payment of periodic alimony upon a showing that\n   <em>\n    the party receiving the periodic alimony is living with another person under circumstances which the court finds should result in the ... termination of alimony because the living arrangements cause such a change of circumstances as to alter the financial needs of that party\n   </em>\n   .\" (Emphasis added.) In the present case, the plaintiff claims that the defendant's financial needs have\n   been altered as a result of her choice to move into the Bloomfield residence with her boyfriend, which caused an approximate savings to her of $840 monthly, separate from and independent of any specific financial contribution by her boyfriend. In light of the language of \u00a7 46b-86 (b) and the facts of this case, the plaintiff was and is entitled, even in the absence of any proof that the boyfriend was contributing to the financial support of the defendant, to the opportunity to prove to the court that the defendant's living arrangements with her boyfriend caused a change of circumstances so as to alter her financial needs to the point where the provisions of paragraph 12 (d) of the separation agreement concerning termination of alimony became applicable and should be enforced.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   In the present case, the court interpreted \u00a7 46b-86 (b) too narrowly by focusing on the lack of proof of the\n   <em>\n    boyfriend's\n   </em>\n   financial contributions, to the exclusion of the\n   <em>\n    defendant's savings\n   </em>\n   as a result of her move.

As\n   <em>\n    Spencer\n   </em>\n   demonstrates, evidence of a $575 reduction in the receiving party's monthly rent obligation is \"clear evidence\" of a change in circumstances as to alter the financial needs of that party.

The plaintiff's claim, however, was that by moving in with her boyfriend, the defendant saved at least $840 per month in expenses, which resulted in a change in circumstances\n   that altered, i.e., reduced, her financial needs. Prior to the defendant's move to the Bloomfield residence, she allegedly paid $1640 per month for housing expenses, but after the move, she was paying $800 per month, an alleged savings to her of approximately $840 monthly, or approximately $10,080 annually.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The operative language in \u00a7 46b-86 (b), \"because the living arrangements cause such a change of circumstances as to alter the financial needs of that party,\" allows the court to consider the defendant's savings as a result of her change in residences in the calculation of whether there has been an alteration in her financial needs. The court has the discretion to conclude, if warranted by the evidence, that the alleged $840 in monthly savings satisfied the requirements of \u00a7 46b-86 (b), resulting in a termination of the defendant's alimony pursuant to paragraph 12 (d) of the separation agreement. See\n   <em>\n    Spencer\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Spencer\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12491401\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/173/1/#p515\">\n    177 Conn.

Murphy. First, the majority's decision conflicts with, and implicitly overturns, prior decisions of this court. Second, the legal standard that the majority opinion announces is contrary to the legislative intent expressed in General Statutes \u00a7 46b-86 (b). In my view, the majority opinion fashions a new and significantly lower standard of proof in cases in which a party seeks to modify or terminate an alimony obligation because the recipient of the alimony is now living with another person.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   This simply is not a case in which the trial court applied the wrong legal standard but, instead, is a case, like many others, in which the moving party did not meet his burden of persuasion with respect to the critical facts he needed to demonstrate in order to be entitled to relief. Accordingly, I respectfully dissent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The following facts and procedural history are relevant to this appeal. The parties were divorced on March 12, 2012. The parties have one minor child that is an issue of the marriage, and the defendant, Jamie D. Murphy, also has a child who was born prior to the marriage and who subsequently was adopted by the plaintiff.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   The court rendered a judgment of marital dissolution in accordance with the parties' separation agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Paragraph 12 of the separation agreement provides that the plaintiff would pay periodic alimony to the defendant in the amount of $400 per month until July, 2016, nonmodifiable as to amount and duration. It further provides that the obligation to pay alimony terminates on the earlier of the (a) death of the plaintiff, (b) death of the defendant, (c) remarriage of the defendant, or (d) cohabitation by the defendant as defined by \u00a7 46b-86 (b). On August 27, 2013, the parties agreed that the plaintiff's alimony obligation should be reduced to $320 per month. This modification later was approved by the court,\n   <em>\n    Olear, J.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   After the divorce, the defendant began renting a condominium on Sunfield Drive in South Windsor. In December, 2014, the defendant moved into her boyfriend's residence in Bloomfield. The defendant paid\n   her boyfriend approximately $800 per month for rent and other housing expenses. She continued to pay all of her personal expenses and the expenses she incurred for the parties' children.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Upon learning that the defendant had moved into her boyfriend's residence in Bloomfield, the plaintiff filed a number of motions, including the amended postjudgment motion seeking termination of his obligation to pay alimony. In that motion, the plaintiff alleged that the defendant had moved to Bloomfield where she was living with her boyfriend and that the new living arrangement caused such a change in circumstances as to alter her financial needs. The plaintiff therefore asked the court to terminate his alimony obligation pursuant to paragraph 12 (d) of the parties' separation agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   On April 21, 2015, the parties entered into a stipulation that was accepted by the court. The stipulation provided, in relevant part, that \"[i]f [the defendant] [did] not return to South Windsor on or before August 15,\n   2015, then the issue of cohabitation and [the plaintiff's] claim to modify/terminate alimony [would] be addressed in mid-September, 2015. Further, if [the defendant] cohabitate[d] in South Windsor the issue of cohabitation [would] also be addressed in mid-September, 2015.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   The plaintiff's counsel further represented to the court that \"[i]f [the defendant] resumes living in South Windsor and leaves the residence where we're claiming that she's residing with her significant other, then the issue of cohabitation ... [is] not a major issue and will likely be done with. If [the defendant] returns with her significant other to South Windsor, or if she does not return to South Windsor and stays in Bloomfield with her significant other, we're going to come back in mid-September and deal with cohabitation.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   On August 14, 2015, as a result of the parties' stipulation, the defendant executed a lease to rent a residence in South Windsor. Although the defendant's boyfriend cosigned the lease, it provided that only the defendant and the parties' two children would occupy the rental residence. The defendant moved into that residence on October 1, 2015.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   At the plaintiff's request, the court subsequently scheduled a hearing on the plaintiff's amended post-judgment motion seeking termination of his alimony obligation. The hearing took place over two days in January and February, 2016, during which the court,\n   <em>\n    Bozzuto, J.\n   </em>\n   , Chief Administrative Judge for Family Matters, heard testimony and admitted into evidence various exhibits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Following the hearing, the court, in a written memorandum of decision, denied the plaintiff's motion. In its decision, the court recognized that the cost of the defendant's rent and utilities decreased when she was living with her boyfriend but reasoned that such a\n   decrease \"does not in and of itself lead to the conclusion that the boyfriend [was] contributing to the defendant's expenses.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Indeed, the court found that \"[t]here was no reliable or persuasive evidence that the defendant's boyfriend paid any of her other personal or housing expenses.\" The court concluded that there was insufficient evidence to draw the inference that, in light of the new living arrangements, the boyfriend contributes financial support to the defendant so as to alter her financial needs. The plaintiff did not offer any credible evidence regarding whether the defendant's boyfriend gave her money for clothing, food, household items, or anything else while she lived at the boyfriend's residence. Nor did the plaintiff offer any credible evidence \"as to the monthly cost of the [Bloomfield] home or an indication of what\n   percentage of the overall cost of the housing the defendant's $800 contribution covered.\" The court reasoned that, standing alone, the fact that the cost of the defendant's rent and utilities decreased while she lived in Bloomfield with her boyfriend did not suffice to show that her boyfriend contributed to her expenses such that the living arrangements altered her financial needs. In sum, the court concluded that the plaintiff failed to meet his burden to persuade it that living with her boyfriend in Bloomfield caused such a change of circumstances as to alter the financial needs of the defendant. \"There is insufficient evidence before the court to draw such a conclusion.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   This appeal followed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   On appeal, the plaintiff primarily argues that the court applied the wrong legal standard in deciding his motion and should have found, on the basis of the evidence presented, that the defendant's financial needs were altered when she was living with her boyfriend simply because she paid less for rent and utilities in Bloomfield than what she had paid at the Sunfield Drive residence in South Windsor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   At the outset, I note the points on which the majority opinion and I appear to agree. Paragraph 12 of the separation agreement provided that the plaintiff would pay periodic alimony to the defendant in the amount of $400 per month until July, 2016, nonmodifiable as to amount and duration, and that the alimony would terminate on the earlier of the (a) death of the plaintiff, (b) death of the defendant, (c) remarriage of the defendant, or (d) cohabitation by the defendant as defined by \u00a7 46b-86 (b).

In light of the previously quoted language from\n   <em>\n    Spencer\n   </em>\n   , I simply cannot read the decision, as the majority seems to do, as standing for the proposition that a reduction in rent is sufficient evidence, by itself, to establish that the alimony recipient's financial needs have altered because the alimony recipient is living with her boyfriend.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   My second point of contention with the majority opinion is that the conclusion it reaches is contrary to the definition of cohabitation set forth in \u00a7 46b-86 (b) because it effectively eliminates the requirement contained in the plain language of the statute that a party seeking to avoid his or her alimony obligation must establish a causal nexus between the living arrangement and the change of circumstances that alters the alimony recipient's needs. The statute plainly states that alimony may be terminated when the party seeking termination establishes that the living arrangements, that is, living with another person, \"\n   <em>\n    cause\n   </em>\n   such a change of circumstances as to alter the financial needs of that party.\" (Emphasis added.) General Statutes \u00a7 46b-86 (b).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   A simple hypothetical will help to explain why I think that the majority's decision eliminates the causal nexus required by the statute. Consider a scenario in which an alimony recipient is living in a residence for which the rent is $2000 per month. In order to reduce her expenses, however, she chooses to move into a new, smaller residence where the rent is only\n   $1200 per month. Several months later, another person moves into the new residence of the alimony recipient, but\n   the cohabitator does not pay any of the rent or otherwise make any financial contributions to the alimony recipient.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Under these circumstances, the decision to cohabitate is not the cause of the alteration of the alimony recipient's financial needs. Instead, the financial needs of the alimony recipient have been altered because of his or her choice to live in a less expensive dwelling and not because he or she has chosen to cohabitate. In the present case, like in the hypothetical, the court made no findings that the defendant's boyfriend contributed in any way to the household's costs for rent, utilities or other personal expenses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   As I understand the majority decision, the combination of the fact that the alimony recipient's expenses have been reduced with the fact that he or she is now living with a third party is sufficient to establish cohabitation pursuant to \u00a7 46b-86 (b) even though there is no evidence that the cohabitator has anything to do with the reduction of those expenses. Such a rule eliminates the causal nexus required by the plain language of the statute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   I do not mean to argue that the financial needs of the alimony recipient in my hypothetical are unaltered or unchanged, or that the alimony obligor is necessarily without a remedy. Because it is not the cohabitation itself, however, that has caused that change, the remedy for the alimony obligor in my hypothetical must be sought pursuant to \u00a7 46b-86 (a), which permits the trial court, unless otherwise precluded by the divorce decree itself, to terminate or modify alimony upon a showing of a \"substantial change in the circumstances of either party ....\" The lower standard of proof fashioned by the majority in this case has the effect of confounding the first two subsections of \u00a7 46b-86.

App. 674\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 682-83,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"108\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=870%20A.2d%201161\">\n    870 A.2d 1161\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2005)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   (whether alimony should be modified pursuant to \u00a7 46b-86 [a] requires different legal analysis than modification pursuant to \u00a7 46b-86 [b] ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   I also should note that the majority concludes that this case should be remanded to the trial court for a new hearing on the motion to terminate alimony. A new hearing, however, seemingly would be unnecessary under the majority's lower standard of proof because, on the basis of the factual findings by the trial court that the defendant's living expenses have been reduced during a period in which she was living with her boyfriend, no other facts would be necessary to entitle the plaintiff to a termination of alimony.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   I do not mean to suggest that the trial court in this case was prohibited from inferring that the defendant was receiving financial support from her boyfriend based on the fact the defendant was paying less rent in Bloomfield after moving in with him than she had been paying in South Windsor. The trial court, however, chose not to draw this inference based on the lack of reliable evidence of financial support by the cohabitator or of what the total amount of rent was for the Bloomfield residence. Thus, in my view, this is simply an unremarkable case in which an experienced trial judge heard the evidence, applied the standard set out in Blum and other appellate decisions, and ultimately concluded that the plaintiff had not met his burden of persuasion to prove the nexus between the alteration in the defendant's financial needs and the fact that she was living with her boyfriend. Instead, the majority's decision to reverse the judgment and implicitly overrule our precedent undoubtedly will surprise members of the bench and bar who have relied on those\n   cases. If the majority believes those cases were incorrectly decided, then we should adhere to the rules regarding when they may be overruled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   I respectfully dissent.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-84\">\n    With respect to the period of time after the defendant moved from Bloomfield back to South Windsor, the court also found that \"the record [was] devoid of reliable or probative evidence that the boyfriend contributes financial support to the defendant ....\" The court therefore concluded that the evidence did not support a finding of cohabitation and declined to terminate the plaintiff's alimony obligation to the defendant. The plaintiff does not challenge on appeal this determination.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-85\">\n    The defendant did not file a brief in this court.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-86\">\n    In other words, the plaintiff does not seek to terminate alimony on the basis of \u00a7 46b-86 (b). Instead, the plaintiff seeks to terminate alimony on the basis of the parties' agreement, in which they simply rely on the statute as a means of defining \"cohabitation.\" See General Statutes \u00a7 46b-86 (b) (\"[i]n the event that a final judgment incorporates a provision of an agreement in which the parties agree to circumstances, other than as provided in this subsection, under which alimony will be modified, including suspension, reduction, or termination of alimony, the court shall enforce the provision of such agreement and enter orders in accordance therewith\"); see also\n    <em>\n     Nation-Bailey\n    </em>\n    v.\n    <em>\n     Bailey\n    </em>\n    , supra,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"109\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=316%20Conn.%20182\">\n     316 Conn. at 198\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"110\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=112%20A.3d%20144\">\n     112 A.3d 144\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-87\">\n    Footnote 3 of the majority opinion implies that the defendant's boyfriend also contributed to expenses related to the defendant's minor children while she was living at the Bloomfield residence by referring to testimony of the defendant that she did not do \"major grocery shopping\" during that time. The trial court, however, made no such finding in its memorandum of decision and, in fact, found that \"[t]here was no reliable or persuasive evidence that the defendant's boyfriend paid any of her other personal or housing expenses.\"\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
