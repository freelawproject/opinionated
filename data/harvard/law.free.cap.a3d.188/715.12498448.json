The respondent, the Commissioner of Correction (commissioner), appeals, upon our grant of his petition for certification, from the judgment of the Appellate Court, which remanded the case to the habeas court, in part, for a new trial on the amended petition for a writ of habeas corpus filed by the petitioner, Denis Hickey.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Hickey\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Commissioner of Correction\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=162%20Conn.%20App.%20505\">\n    162 Conn.

On appeal, the commissioner contends that the Appellate Court improperly created a per se rule requiring defense counsel, upon the introduction of prior, uncharged sexual misconduct evidence, to ask for a contemporaneous limiting instruction and a final charge restricting the use of such evidence to propensity and, in so doing, failed to hold the petitioner to his burden of proof under\n   <em>\n    Strickland\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Washington\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6204802\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/466/668/#p689\">\n    466 U.S. 668\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 689,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6204802\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/466/668/#p689\">\n    104 S.Ct. 2052\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6204802\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/466/668/#p689\">\n    80 L.Ed.2d 674\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1984). The commissioner also contends that, after concluding that the habeas court improperly\n   analyzed prejudice, the Appellate Court should have engaged in a plenary review of the evidence in the record and determined that the petitioner had\n   failed to prove prejudice. We agree with the commissioner, and conclude that even if we assume, without deciding, that the performance of the petitioner's trial counsel was deficient, the petitioner failed to prove prejudice. We therefore conclude that the petitioner cannot prevail on his claim of ineffective assistance of trial counsel and, accordingly, reverse in part the judgment of the Appellate Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The opinion of the Appellate Court sets forth the relevant facts and procedural history. \"In June, 2009, the petitioner was convicted of one count of sexual assault in the first degree in violation of General Statutes [Rev. to 2001] \u00a7 53a-70 (a) (2) and one count of risk of injury to a child in violation of General Statutes [Rev. to 2001] \u00a7 53-21 (a) (2)....

With respect to the petitioner's trial counsel, the court found that he filed a motion in limine to preclude R.N.'s testimony, which was\n   denied by the trial court. During trial, however, trial counsel did not ask the court to provide a cautionary instruction to the jury immediately prior to or after R.N. testified about the petitioner's prior, uncharged sexual misconduct. Moreover, the habeas court found that trial counsel's request to charge as to prior, uncharged sexual misconduct did not limit the use of such evidence to the issue of propensity. The habeas court found that the only instruction the trial court gave the jury with respect to the uncharged misconduct came after the close of evidence and before the case went to the jury, and that the instruction 'did not limit the use of the evidence to the issue of propensity.' The habeas court concluded that trial counsel's failure to request the appropriate cautionary jury instruction at the proper times constituted deficient performance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \"The habeas court also found that the petitioner had satisfied his burden of demonstrating prejudice because 'there is a reasonable probability that the outcome of the proceedings would have been different had it not been for [the] deficient performance [of petitioner's trial counsel].'

On appeal to the Appellate Court, the commissioner did not challenge any of the factual findings made by the habeas court. Rather, the commissioner challenged the legal sufficiency of the habeas court's prejudice analysis and claimed that, applying the correct legal standard to the facts found by the habeas court and the evidence in the record of the underlying criminal trial, the petitioner could not establish prejudice from trial counsel's deficient performance. Given that the habeas court relied on facts from the criminal trial and its own, undisputed historical factual findings, the Appellate Court had no reason to remand the case to the habeas court to conduct a proper prejudice analysis that the Appellate Court itself could have performed.

Given that, under\n   <em>\n    DeJesus\n   </em>\n   , the jury was permitted to use the evidence for propensity purposes, the language contained in the final charge-which mirrored, almost exactly, the language set forth in\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    DeJesus\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3713810\" index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/288/418/#p441\">\n    288 Conn. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   474 n.36,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=953%20A.2d%2045\">\n    953 A.2d 45\n   </extracted-citation>\n   -provided sufficient legal guidance for the jury such that it is not reasonably likely that the result of the trial would have been different.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   We note that, in other contexts, it is important to direct a jury\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   to use prior, uncharged misconduct evidence as proof of propensity. These circumstances include when the evidence of prior, uncharged misconduct is admitted to prove, among other things, intent, identity, or motive. See Conn. Code Evid. \u00a7 4-5 (c). In such cases, the timing and the precise wording of the instruction are most important when testimony is presented for a limited use. When, as in the present case, testimony is offered for the broader purpose of propensity, however, the timing and precise wording of the limiting instruction are less important. Moreover, we have stated in other contexts that, \"[w]hile a request to charge that is relevant to the issues in a case and that accurately states the applicable law must be honored, a [trial] court need not tailor its charge to the precise letter of such a request.... If a requested charge is in substance given, the [trial] court's failure to give a charge in exact conformance with the words of the request will not constitute a ground for reversal.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Baltas\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=311%20Conn.%20786\">\n    311 Conn. 786\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 808-809,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=91%20A.3d%20384\">\n    91 A.3d 384\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2014). Likewise, in the present case, because we conclude that the charge given by the trial court adequately conveyed to the jury the proper use of the prior, uncharged sexual misconduct testimony, trial counsel's failure to request specific propensity language is not a sufficient ground to disturb\n   the petitioner's conviction. Moreover, had the trial court emphasized that the testimony could be used for propensity, it is likely that this would have\n   <em>\n    hurt\n   </em>\n   the petitioner's case because, the instruction, as given, did not specifically advise the jury that it could find that the petitioner had a propensity to sexually assault young girls. Thus, far from establishing prejudice, the omission of the word \"propensity\" from the instruction likely inured to the benefit of the petitioner.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   We next consider whether trial counsel's failure to request, and the trial\n   court's failure to provide, a contemporaneous jury instruction was prejudicial. We conclude that this did not prejudice the petitioner because, as we have already explained, the court's final charge admonished the jury that it could not find the petitioner guilty solely on the basis of the prior, uncharged sexual misconduct testimony, that it must find that the state had proven each element of the charged offenses, and that the petitioner was not on trial for the uncharged conduct.\n   <em>\n    Hickey\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Commissioner of Correction\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=162%20Conn.%20App.%20505\">\n    162 Conn.
