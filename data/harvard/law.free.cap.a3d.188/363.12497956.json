(Nancy),\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   by \"comitt[ing] acts of sexual abuse against\" her. Because we conclude there was sufficient credible evidence in the record\n   supporting the court's factual findings and abuse or neglect determination, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On February 12, 2015, the Division of Child Protection and Permanency (Division) responded to a Newark Police Department referral that defendant was arrested for sexually abusing Nancy. Defendant is Nancy's stepfather, and father to DiA.C., born in 2002, Di.C., born in 2005, L.C., born in 2008, and A.C., born in 2011.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Nancy reported to Newark police officers and the Division that during the evening of February 7, 2015, defendant asked her to check on him by text message because he was going out drinking. She explained defendant left their home and she spoke with him at approximately 4:00 a.m. the following morning when he called her and asked if she was awake. Defendant then asked Nancy to come downstairs so they could leave to get food. Nancy agreed, got in defendant's vehicle when he arrived home, and defendant then drove to a dark street. According to Nancy, defendant parked the vehicle, kissed her on the lips and neck, and forcibly inserted his finger into her vagina. Defendant stopped when Nancy's mother, A.D., called him on the phone asking where they were. Defendant then took Nancy to a fast food restaurant, where he bought food for them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Nancy further reported that on their way home, defendant asked if she was angry with him, and that he felt \"stupid\" for what he had done. Nancy said defendant had sexually abused her since she was twelve years old. A.D. told the Division caseworker that defendant confirmed he took Nancy with him to purchase food\n   on the night of the alleged sexual assault, but denied ever sexually assaulting Nancy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Nancy also reported prior instances of inappropriate sexual contact with defendant. She stated defendant once \"tested\" her to see if she would do anything sexual with boys by touching her on her thigh area close to her vagina and buttocks. She told defendant\n   to stop, and he told her she passed his \"test.\" Nancy reported that when she was a young child, defendant took her clothes off while she was sleeping, but was interrupted when her mother walked into the room. Nancy also reported that defendant tried to hump her buttocks area when she was twelve while he was intoxicated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   In his February 12, 2015 statements to Newark police and the Division, defendant said he exchanged text messages with Nancy on February 7, 2015, because \"she would always check on him if he [went] out to drink.\" Defendant admitted asking Nancy to come downstairs and get into his car, and getting food with her during the early hours of February 8, 2015. Defendant confirmed he received a phone call from A.D. while they were getting food, asking where they were. Defendant stated he told A.D. that they were getting food, and returned home with Nancy soon thereafter. Defendant denied ever touching Nancy inappropriately.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Defendant admitted to taking Nancy \"through a test about boys.\" Defendant stated he only \"talked her through everything,\" and \"never physically touched her.\" Defendant also admitted he took Nancy's clothes off while she was sleeping when she was a young child, but did so because she fell asleep in dirty clothes. Defendant denied humping Nancy's buttocks when she was twelve.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   In an interview conducted that same day, A.D. stated that on February 8, 2015, at approximately 4:00 a.m., she noticed defendant and Nancy were not home. She then called defendant at approximately 4:30 a.m., and he said he called Nancy to come downstairs and took her to get food. A.D. indicated that Nancy and defendant then returned home.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Following her report on February 12, 2015, Nancy went to the Newark Beth Israel Medical Center for a physical examination, which revealed her hymen was not intact and she suffered from pain and tenderness in her vaginal area. The examining physician, Dr. Kereese Gayle, wrote in her notes that her \"clinical impression\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   was that Nancy had been sexually assaulted and listed \"sexual abuse of adolescent\" as her diagnosis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   On February 25, 2015, the Division filed a verified complaint and order to show cause in the Law Division, seeking the care and supervision of Nancy as well as defendant's four biological children. The court granted the Division's request, and ordered that defendant \"remain out of the home,\" and \"shall not have any contact with [the children] until further order of the court.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   On March 11, 2015, Nancy was admitted to the Newark Beth Israel Medical Center's Children's Crisis Intervention Services Unit (Crisis Unit) for a psychological evaluation. The discharge summary described Dr. Lindsay Liotta's findings and showed Nancy expressed feelings of suicide, anxiety and depression. The discharge summary stated that Nancy had a \"history of being assaulted by [defendant],\" the most recent incident being two months prior to her admission in the Crisis Unit. The discharge summary listed post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) as a \"diagnosis at discharge.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The court held a fact-finding hearing, but Dr. Gayle and Dr. Liotta were not called to testify. Over defense counsel's\n   objection, the court admitted in evidence portions of Dr. Gayle's report, including her diagnosis Nancy was sexually assaulted, and Nancy's psychological records as \"notes or observations of the doctors,\" and rejected defendant's assertion they included inadmissible complex diagnoses. After hearing testimony from Division caseworker Wilmer Mendez and reviewing Nancy's medical and psychological records, the court found the Division established by a preponderance of the evidence that defendant abused or neglected Nancy by \"comitt[ing] acts of sexual abuse,\" and placed his four biological children at significant risk of harm under N.J.S.A. 9:6-8.21(c).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   In an oral decision, the court concluded Nancy's allegations regarding the February 8, 2015 sexual assault were corroborated, because defendant \"corroborated ... all of the facts provided in [Nancy's] account of what occurred on the subject night with the exception of the actual sexual assault.\" The court also found\n   Nancy \"made consistent disclosures\" regarding the sexual assault, and determined it was \"certainly satisfied that [Nancy's] statement was corroborated, [and] ... credible.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The court placed particular emphasis on Dr. Gayle's clinical finding that Nancy had been sexually assaulted, and determined the Crisis Unit's discharge summary suggested that Nancy \"had not had\" PTSD or become anxious and suicidal \"prior to these allegations of sexual abuse.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   In its subsequent written decision, the court found defendant abused or neglected Nancy by sexually assaulting her on February 8, 2015, and sexually abusing her on prior occasions. The court found defendant gave Nancy a \"test\" where he rubbed her thigh close to her vagina. The court further found defendant humped Nancy on a previous occasion, and took her clothes off while she was sleeping. The court found defendant's admissions \"sufficiently corroborate[d] [Nancy's] statements.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The court concluded defendant's history of inappropriate sexual conduct with Nancy placed all of the children \"at substantial risk of injury,\" as defendant \"ha[d] not addressed any sexual [deviance].\" In its fact-finding order, the court noted that defendant had \"not admitted that this abuse occurred or taken any steps to address the sexual abuse and mitigate the risk of harm he poses to the other children which places the children at significant risk of harm.\" The court ordered that the children remain in the care and supervision of the Division, and ordered defendant's placement on the Child Abuse Registry.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   On February 22, 2016, after a series of compliance hearings, the court entered an order terminating the abuse or neglect proceedings by the consent of all parties, ordering that defendant have no contact with Nancy, and that a prior order requiring that defendant have no contact with his biological children outside of Division supervision remain in effect.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   This appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Defendant presents the following arguments for our consideration:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   <em>\n    LEGAL ARGUMENT\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN FINDING THAT [DEFENDANT] COMMITTED AN ACT OF ABUSE OR NEGLECT AGAINST NANCY BECAUSE NO CREDIBLE EVIDENCE WAS PROVIDED TO CORROBORATE NANCY'S ALLEGATIONS UPON WHICH THE TRIAL COURT MADE ITS FINDINGS.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   A. The Trial Court Erred in Finding That Nancy's Allegations Were Corroborated By Multiple Re-Tellings To Different People And By [Defendant's] Statements.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   B. The Trial Court Erred ... When It Relied On Inadmissible Evidence In Making Its Findings Of Fact.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Defendant argues the court erred by finding abuse or neglect based solely on Nancy's statements, which he contends were not corroborated as required by N.J.S.A. 9:6-8.46(a)(4). Defendant challenges the court's finding that Nancy's allegation of sexual abuse was corroborated by her repetition of the allegation, by his own statements to police and Division caseworkers, and by medical and psychological reports introduced into evidence at the fact-finding hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   We are guided by the well-established principle that \"[w]e accord substantial deference and defer to the factual findings of the Family Part if they are sustained by 'adequate, substantial, and credible evidence' in the record.\"\n   <em>\n    N.J.

The court also based its abuse or neglect finding on Nancy's reports that defendant sexually touched her on three prior occasions. With regard to her statement regarding the \"test,\" defendant admitted he \"took [Nancy] through a test about boys,\" but denied having physical contact. He stated he did so to teach Nancy \"what boys can do to get slick and get their feel off on young girls.\" As with the February 8, 2015 assault, the only fact defendant failed to corroborate was the inappropriate sexual touching itself. Although defendant\n   makes no arguments otherwise, we find that his admission concerning the administration of the \"test\" provide some evidence supporting Nancy's version of the event and therefore provides sufficient corroboration of Nancy's account under N.J.S.A. 9:6-8.46(a)(4).\n   <em>\n    N.B.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12301311\" index=\"118\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj-super/452/513/#p521\">\n    452 N.J.
