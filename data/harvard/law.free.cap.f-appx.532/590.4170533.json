He argues that the district court erred by imposing a 16-level sentence enhancement pursuant to United States Sentencing Guidelines \u00a7 2L1.2 based upon his two prior convictions for indecency with a child in violation of Texas Penal Code \u00a7 21.11. He contends that \u00a7 21.11 does not satisfy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>the \u201cgeneric, contemporary meaning\u201d of either \u201cstatutory rape\u201d or \u201csexual abuse of a minor\u201d because it criminalizes sexual conduct with persons under the age of 17, and it criminalizes conduct where the age differential is less than four years. He concedes that his arguments are foreclosed by this court\u2019s precedent, but he seeks to preserve them for further review. The Government has moved for summary affirmance or, in the alternative, an extension of time to file a brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-5\">Rivera-Pina\u2019s arguments are foreclosed by our decision in <em>United States v. Rodriguez, </em>711 F.3d 541 (5th Cir.2013) (en banc). The defendant in <em>Rodriguez </em>challenged a sentence enhancement under \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii) based on his conviction for sexual assault of a child in violation of Texas Penal Code \u00a7 22.011(a)(2). <em>Rodriguez, </em>711 F.3d at 544. We rejected his contention that \u00a7 22.011(a)(2) is broader than the \u201cgeneric, contemporary meaning\u201d of \u201csexual abuse of a minor\u201d because it prescribes a three-year instead of a four-year age differential between the victim and the defendant. <em>Id. </em>at 562 n. 8. We also rejected his challenge to the Texas statute\u2019s definition of the term \u201cchild\u201d as a person under age 17. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b617-7\">Consequently, the motion for summary affirmance is GRANTED and the motion for an extension of time is DENIED.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b616-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
