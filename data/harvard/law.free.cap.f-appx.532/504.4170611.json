For the first time on appeal, he argues that his offense level was improperly enhanced under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(i) based on his prior federal conviction for conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute marijuana. He maintains that his prior conspiracy conviction under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846 did not require any overt act, that it therefore was not a conspiracy within the generic, contemporary meaning of the word, and that it cannot support the enhancement.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-8\">Because of the absence of an objection at sentencing, we review Grimaldo\u2019s arguments only for plain error. <em>See United States v. Rodriguez-Escareno, </em>700 F.3d 751, 753 (5th Cir.2012). In considering whether a prior federal conviction for conspiracy to commit a drug trafficking offense will justify an enhancement under \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(i), we need look no further than the federal Sentencing Guidelines. <em>Id. </em>at 753-54. The \u201cGuidelines themselves, reasonably interpreted,\u201d support the enhancement. <em>Id. </em>at 754. Accordingly, the district court did not err in applying the enhancement. <em>Id. </em>at 754-55.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b531-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
