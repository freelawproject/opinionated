Liab. Litig., </em>418 F.3d 372, 378 (3d Cir.2005). \u201cA petitioner seeking the issuance of a writ of mandamus must have no other adequate means to obtain the desired relief, and must show that the right to issuance is clear and indisputable.\u201d <em>Madden v. Myers, </em>102 F.3d 74, 79 (3d Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b72-19\">In this matter, Bey has not shown that he has a clear and indisputable right to have this Court compel the Superior Court of New Jersey to dismiss his criminal proceeding. <em>See id. </em>Further, mandamus typically may be \u201cused to confine an inferior court to a lawful exercise of its prescribed jurisdiction or to compel it to exercise its authority when it is its duty to do so.\u201d <em>In re Diet Drugs, </em>418 F.3d at 378 (internal quotation marks omitted). The Superior Court of New Jersey is not an \u201cinferior court\u201d of this Court, and, except in limited circumstances, federal courts do not have the power to compel state courts to act in a particular way. <em>See Atl. Coast Line R.R. Co. v. Bhd. of Locomotive Eng\u2019rs, </em>398 U.S. 281, 286, 90 S.Ct. 1739, 26 L.Ed.2d 234 (1970); <em>Younger v. Harris, </em>401 U.S. 37, 45, 91 S.Ct. 746, 27 L.Ed.2d 669 (1971); <em>In re Grand Jury Proceedings, </em>654 F.2d 268, 278-79 (3d Cir.1981). Accordingly, we deny Bey\u2019s petition for a writ of mandamus compelling the Superior Court of New Jersey to dismiss the criminal proceedings against him.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b72-17\">. Bey has been indicted for third degree forgery, uttering a forged instrument, and third degree theft by deception stemming from an episode where Bey allegedly cashed a check on which the name of the intended payee was altered. In his petition, Bey asserts that the Superior Court of New Jersey does not have jurisdiction over him, as he is a \u201cMoorish American\u201d citizen, and is not subject to the jurisdiction of the courts of the United States per the laws of the Moorish American National Republic, the Thirteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution, and the Emancipation Proclamation. The Superior Court of New Jersey has rejected this argument.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
