Stafford, Jr., Senior District Judge for the U.S. District Court for <em>the </em>Northern District of Florida, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b716-16\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>***</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b716-17\">Bibi Rakhsana Hayee appeals the district court\u2019s decision affirming the Administrative Law Judge\u2019s (\u201cALJ\u201d) denial of her application for disability insurance benefits and supplemental security income. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm the district court\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-22\">We review de novo the district court\u2019s order affirming the ALJ\u2019s denial of benefits. <em>Tommasetti v. Astrue, </em>533 F.3d 1035, 1038 (9th Cir.2008). We may reverse only if the ALJ\u2019s decision was based on legal error or was not supported by substantial evidence in the record as a whole. <em>Molina v. Astrue, </em>674 F.3d 1104, 1110 (9th Cir. 2012). \u201cThe ALJ is responsible <em>for </em>determining credibility, resolving conflicts in medical testimony, and resolving [any other] ambiguities\u201d that might exist. <em>Edlund v. Massanari, </em>253 F.3d 1152, 1156 (9th Cir.2001). Because the factual and procedural background is familiar to the parties, we do not recount it here.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-23\">Hayee first argues that the ALJ erred at Step Two of the sequential analysis by failing to follow the \u201cspecial technique\u201d required by 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1520a for evaluating mental impairments. Hayee admits that she did not raise this argument before the district court. As a general rule, this court does not consider issues that were not first raised before the district court. <em>Edlund, </em>253 F.3d at 1158. Athough this court has the discretion to make an exception to waiver in certain circumstances, we find no circumstances in this case that would justify such an exception. Accordingly, we conclude that Hayee has waived her first issue on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-24\">Hayee next argues that the ALJ erred by failing to provide \u201cclear and convincing\u201d reasons for rejecting the opinion of Dr. Kalman, an examining psychiatrist who met with Hayee on only one occasion. The record, however, belies Hayee\u2019s argument in this regard. The ALJ well explained <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"691\">*691</page-number>that she gave little weight to Dr. Kalman\u2019s report because it was not based on observation of Hayee over an extended period of time, was not supported by objective clinical testing, was not consistent with Hayee\u2019s own characterization of her condition, and was overly reliant on the less-than-credible statements of Hayee, who was described by Dr. Kalman himself as \u201ca poor historian.\u201d Because the ALJ discounted Dr. Kalman\u2019s report based on specific, legitimate reasons that were supported by substantial evidence, we find no merit to Hayee\u2019s second argument on appeal. <em>Lester v. Chater, </em>81 F.3d 821, 830-31 (9th Cir.1995) (noting that when an examining physician\u2019s opinion has been contradicted, an ALJ may reject it only by providing \u201cspecific and legitimate reasons that are supported by substantial evidence in the record\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b717-5\">Finally, Hayee argues that the ALJ\u2019s residual functional capacity (\u201cRFC\u201d) finding was not based on substantial evidence. We disagree. The ALJ gave specific and legitimate reasons, supported by substantial evidence, for finding Hayee to be \u201cnot entirely credible\u201d about her symptoms and limitations, for giving little weight to Dr. Kalman\u2019s mental impairment assessment, for rejecting Dr. Tanson\u2019s functional capacity assessment, and for giving significant weight to the functional capacity assessment of Dr. Garfinkel, the only physician whose opinion was both consistent with the record evidence and supported by objective findings. Based largely on Dr. Garfinkel\u2019s assessment, the ALJ properly included in her RFC determination all of those limitations that she found to be credible and supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b716-26\"> xhiS disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
