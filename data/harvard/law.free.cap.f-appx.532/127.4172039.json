Rivers Muhammad, Sr., proceeding pro se, appeals from the District Court\u2019s order denying his \u201cMotion for Federal Injunctive Relief &amp; Damages Pursuant to \u00a7 1983\u201d and dismissing the claims raised therein. Because this appeal does not present a substantial question, we will summarily affirm. <em>See </em>Third Cir. LAR 27.4; I.O.P. 10.6.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-19\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-20\">In November 2010, Muhammad filed a pro se complaint in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania alleging various constitutional violations in connection with his parental termination proceedings in the Luzerne County Court of Common Pleas, Orphans\u2019 Court Division (LCCCP). The District Court dismissed the complaint, and, upon review, this Court affirmed the District Court\u2019s order. <em>Muhammad v. Cappellini, </em>477 Fed.Appx. 935 (3d Cir.2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b153-21\">Muhammad subsequently returned to the District Court and filed a \u201cMotion for Federal Injunctive Relief &amp; Damages Pursuant to \u00a7 1983\u201d raising new claims against new parties in connection with his parental termination proceedings in the LCCCP. Specifically, Muhammad alleged <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>that: (1) the LCCCP and former LCCCP Judge Michael Conahan deprived him of his Fourteenth Amendment Due Process rights and First Amendment rights of free speech and to petition the government for redress of grievances; and (2) the Superior Court of Pennsylvania and the judges who reviewed the termination proceedings \u2014 the Honorable Kate Ford Elliott, the Honorable Jacqueline O. Shogan, and the Honorable Robert E. Col-ville \u2014 deprived him of his Fourteenth Amendment Due Process rights by failing to address the merits of his ineffective assistance of counsel claim. Muhammad requested that the District Court enter an order vacating the LCCCP\u2019s order terminating his parental rights as well as the Pennsylvania Superior Court\u2019s order affirming that decision. He also demanded immediate physical and legal custody of his son and $50 million in damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-4\">The District Court construed the motion as a new complaint, reviewed it pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(a)(2), and dismissed the claims raised therein on immunity grounds. Specifically, the District Court found that the LCCCP and the Superior Court of Pennsylvania, as well as the judicial defendants, were immune from suit under the Eleventh Amendment. <em>See Benn v. First Judicial Dist. of Pa., </em>426 F.3d 233, 240 (3d Cir.2005) (explaining that Commonwealth courts and judicial defendants are entitled to Eleventh Amendment immunity); <em>Azubuko v. Royal, </em>443 F.3d 302, 303 (3d Cir.2006) (explaining that judicial officers acting in their official capacity are immune from suit). This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-6\">We will summarily affirm the District Court\u2019s order. The District Court fairly construed the pro se filing as a new complaint and correctly concluded that Muhammad had failed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted. <em>See Ashcroft v. Iqbal, </em>556 U.S. 662, 678, 129 S.Ct. 1937, 173 L.Ed.2d 868 (2009). We refer the parties to the District Court\u2019s thorough opinion, which we have no need to summarize here.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-8\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-9\">Accordingly, because no substantial question is presented by this appeal, we will summarily affirm the District Court\u2019s judgment. <em>See </em>Third Cir. LAR 27.4; I.O.P. 10.6.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
