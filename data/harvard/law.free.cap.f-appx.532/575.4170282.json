The district court also revoked Guerrero\u2019s term of supervised release on a prior conviction and imposed a sentence at the top of the advisory range of 10 months, to run consecutively to the illegal reentry sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-8\">For the first time on appeal, Guerrero argues that his offense level was improperly enhanced under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(i) based on his prior federal conviction for conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute cocaine. We review Guerrero\u2019s arguments only for plain error. <em>See United States v. Rodriguez-Escareno, </em>700 F.3d 751, 753 (5th Cir.2012). In <em>Rodriguez-Escareno, </em>this court held that a conviction for a federal drug trafficking offense and a conviction for the federal crime of conspiring to commit such an offense will support a sentence enhancement under \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(i). <em>Id. </em>at 753-54. Guerrero\u2019s arguments are foreclosed by <em>Rodriguez-Escareno.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b602-11\">Guerrero concedes that precedent forecloses his argument that the lack of an empirical basis for \u00a7 2L1.2 precludes an appellate presumption that his 46-month sentence is reasonable. <em>See United States v. Mondragon-Santiago, </em>564 F.3d 357, 366 (5th Cir.2009). However, he contends that his sentence is greater than necessary to meet the sentencing goals of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) because the Sentencing Guidelines account for a prior conviction both to increase his offense level and to calculate his criminal history score. Guerrero avers further that the guidelines range overstated the seriousness of his offense because his conduct was not violent and that the guidelines range did not properly account for his personal history and characteristics, including his motive for reentering.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-12\">We review a sentence for reasonableness. <em>See Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 56, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). Because it is within the properly calculated guidelines range, Guerrero\u2019s sentence is entitled to a presumption of reasonableness. <em>See Rita v. United States, </em>551 U.S. 338, 350-51, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007); <em>Mondragon-Santiago, </em>564 F.3d at 366. Guerrero offers no good reason for us to disturb that presumption. <em>See Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 51, 128 S.Ct. 586; <em>United States v. Aguirre-Villa, </em>460 F.3d 681, 683 (5th Cir.2006). Moreover, the sentence is not rendered unreasonable by the lack of empirical basis for the illegal reentry guideline or by any double-counting of Guerrero\u2019s criminal history. <em>See United States v. Duarte, </em>569 F.3d 528, 529-31 (5th Cir.2009). We also find no merit in the argument that the sentence is unreasonable because illegal reentry amounts to a nonviolent trespass <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>offense. <em>See Aguirre-Villa, </em>460 F.3d at 683.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-5\">As his last point of error, Guerrero argues that imposing his revocation sentence to run consecutively to the sentence for his reentry offense was unreasonable. Because Guerrero failed to object to the reasonableness of his revocation sentence, review is for plain error. <em>See United States v. Whitelaw, </em>580 F.3d 256, 259-60 (5th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b603-6\">The imposition of the consecutive revocation sentence is authorized by statute and preferred under the Guidelines. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3584; \u00a7 7B1.3(f), p.s., &amp; comment. (n. 4). Guerrero has failed to show that the district court, in determining that the revocation sentence should run consecutively to the sentence for the underlying offense, plainly erred. <em>See Whitelaw, </em>580 F.3d at 259-60.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b602-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
