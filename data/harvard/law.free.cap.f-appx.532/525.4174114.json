He argues, for the first time on appeal, that the sentence imposed was substantively unreasonable because it was greater than necessary to achieve the sentencing objectives set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b552-5\">Defense counsel concedes that Rosario has been released from prison and deported. Relying on <em>United States v. Lares-Meraz, </em>452 F.3d 352, 354-55 (5th Cir. 2006), however, Rosario argues that his appeal is not moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-6\">Whether an appeal is moot is a jurisdictional issue. <em>Lares-Meraz, </em>452 F.3d at 354-55. Rosario\u2019s attack on his sentence has been rendered moot by his deportation because there is no relief that this court may grant him with respect to his sentence. <em>See United States v. Rosenbaum-Alanis, </em>483 F.3d 381, 383 (5th Cir.2007). Accordingly, the appeal is DISMISSED for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b552-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
