Primerica Holdings, </em>10 F.3d 155, 163 (3d Cir.1993) (\u201cMandamus is a proper means for this court to review a district court judge\u2019s refusal to recuse from a case pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 455(a), where the judge\u2019s impartiality might reasonably be questioned.\u201d) (citation omitted). Disposing of the first (which Nelson filed in 2011), we found no error in the District Judge\u2019s decision to continue presiding over the ease; that \u201cJudge Conner ruled against Nelson and expressed doubt as to his outrageous government misconduct defense is insufficient to establish personal bias or prejudice warranting recusal.\u201d <em>In re Nelson, </em>431 Fed.Appx. 213, 216 (3d Cir.2011) (nonprecedential per curiam). Nor did we find substantiated Nelson\u2019s claims that Judge Conner was \u201cinvolved in the alleged conspiracy against him\u201d by \u201cappointing the attorneys who allegedly sabotaged him.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We further explained that Nelson\u2019s allegations of error could, in general, be raised on appeal and in collateral proceedings. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b103-19\">Since our June 2011 decision, Nelson has sought relief on direct appeal. In that matter, we granted counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw under <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), and affirmed Nelson\u2019s conviction and sentence. <em>See United States v. Nelson, </em>488 Fed.Appx. 552, 554 (3d Cir.2012) (nonprecedential). Nelson has also filed a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion, alleging (inter alia) judicial misconduct and ineffective assistance of counsel, that remains pending before Judge Conner at the time of this writing.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-20\">In this mandamus petition, Nelson argues that Judge Conner \u201callowed the defense counsel to act as a Government Agent\u201d by \u201csit[ting] in ex-parte proceedings\u201d and \u201csubmitting] false documents\u201d to the Court, which \u201cdemonstrate^] the Judge\u2019s deep[-]seated favoritism[ ] for the Government.\u201d In other words, he raises nothing new. Many of the present allegations were invoked in counsel\u2019s <em>Anders </em>brief on direct appeal, and others are contained in Nelson\u2019s collateral attack. None appears to pertain to, or otherwise indicate, a level of bias that would justify the extraordinary remedy of mandamus. <em>See Cheney v. U.S. Dist. Court for D.C., </em>542 U.S. 367, 380, 124 S.Ct. 2576, 159 L.Ed.2d 459 (2004). Moreover, Nelson clearly may pursue relief by alternative means, as he has done. <em>In re Pressman-Gutman Co., </em>459 F.3d 383, 399 (3d Cir.2006). For sub<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>stantially the same reasons discussed in our opinion relating to Nelson\u2019s prior mandamus petition, we conclude that relief is unwarranted and will deny this petition. <em>See Primerica, </em>10 F.Bd at 168 &amp; n. 9. To the extent that Nelson requests other relief in his filings in this Court, his requests are denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
