For the following reasons, we will affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-19\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-20\">Bullock was convicted of conspiracy to distribute cocaine base following a jury trial. Under the then-mandatory Sentencing Guidelines, Bullock\u2019s base offense level was 36. However, his adjusted offense level was 44 after the application of various sentencing enhancements. Bullock\u2019s Guidelines range called for life imprisonment, which the late Honorable James M. Kelly imposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-22\">We affirmed on direct appeal. <em>United States v. Bullock, </em>129 F.3d 1256 (3d Cir. 1997). After unsuccessfully pursuing post-conviction relief, Bullock filed a motion for reduction of sentence pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) and Amendment 706 to the Guidelines, which lowered the base offense level for certain quantities of crack cocaine under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(c). The District Court reduced Bullock\u2019s sentence to 360 months\u2019 imprisonment but denied his request for an additional reduction, and we affirmed. <em>See United States v. Bullock, </em>No. 08-4098 (order entered Oct. 19, 2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b205-23\">In November 2012, Bullock filed a motion pursuant to \u00a7 3582(c)(2) and Amendment 591, arguing that the sentencing court incorrectly applied the base offense level for crack cocaine offenses because the Government failed to prove that the substance at issue was crack cocaine. He further asserted that the sentencing court\u2019s determination that the substance was crack cocaine was based on an insufficient factual basis. The District Court denied his motion, noting that Amendment 591 did not impact the selection of the appropriate base offense level under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1. Bullock timely filed this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-24\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-25\">We exercise jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review the District Court\u2019s ultimate decision to deny Bullock\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion for abuse of discretion, but review de novo the District Court\u2019s legal interpretation of relevant statutes and guidelines. <em>United States v. Mateo, 560 F.Sd </em>152, 154 (3d Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b206-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>III.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-4\">Under \u00a7 3582(c)(2), a sentencing court may reduce an imposed sentence based on a subsequent amendment to the Guidelines if the amendment is named in the policy statement contained in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10. <em>See United States v. McBride, </em>283 F.3d 612, 614 (3d Cir.2002). Amendment 591 is retroactively applicable under \u00a7 lB1.10(c). The Guidelines require a sentencing court to refer to the Statutory Index of the Sentencing Manual (Appendix A) to choose the offense guideline. Amendment 591 no longer permits the sentencing court to choose the offense guideline based on the offender\u2019s actual conduct; instead, the sentencing court must apply the offense guideline that corresponds to the statute of conviction. <em>See United States v. Diaz, </em>245 F.3d 294, 302 (3d Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b206-5\">In denying Bullock\u2019s motion, the District Court explained that the sentencing court referenced Appendix A and selected \u00a7 2D1.1 as the applicable offense guideline for Bullock\u2019s conviction under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846. No violation of Amendment 591 occurred, as this is exactly the procedure now mandated by the amendment. In his motion, Bullock argues that Amendment 591 would preclude the District Court from relying on the cocaine base portions of \u00a7 2Dl.l\u2019s drug weight table to determine his base offense level. However, he confuses the concepts of the applicable \u201coffense guideline\u201d with the \u201cbase offense level\u201d within that offense guideline. <em>See United States v. Rivera, </em>293 F.3d 584, 585 (2d Cir.2002); <em>accord United States v. Moreno, </em>421 F.3d 1217, 1219-20 (11th Cir. 2005) (Amendment 591 does not restrict the use of judicially-found facts to select the base offense level). Accordingly, Amendment 591 does not afford Bullock any relief.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b206-10\">In his brief, Bullock alleges that Amendment 591 precludes application of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1 altogether. He argues that \u00a7 2D1.1 only applies to crack cocaine and that there are no guidelines for offenses involving other forms of cocaine base. Bullock\u2019s argument is clearly misplaced, as offenses involving other forms of cocaine base would still be governed by \u00a7 2D1.1, but the substance would be treated as cocaine for determining the base offense level. <em>See United States v. Barbosa, </em>271 F.3d 438, 467 (3d Cir.2001) (under the Sentencing Guidelines, use of the term \u201ccocaine base\u201d only refers to crack); <em>see also </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(c) (distinguishing between cocaine and cocaine base in the drug quantity table). Furthermore, the sentencing court\u2019s determination that Bullock conspired to distribute crack cocaine cannot be reconsidered under the limited scope of \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>See Dillon v. United States, </em>560 U.S. 817, 130 S.Ct. 2683, 2694, 177 L.Ed.2d 271 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b206-11\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-12\">For the foregoing reasons, we will affirm the District Court\u2019s order.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b206-6\">. We disagree with Bullock that Amendment 591 contains any ambiguity that could be construed in his favor under the rule of lenity. <em>See United States v. Flemming, </em>617 F.3d 252, 269-70 (3d Cir.2010).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
