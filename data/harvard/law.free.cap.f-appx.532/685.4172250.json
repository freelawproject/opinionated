The BIA correctly determined that Rivera-Oliva\u2019s application for asylum was time-barred. Rivera-Oliva failed to establish changed or extraordinary circumstances to excuse his untimely filing. <em>See Husyev v. Mukasey, </em>528 F.3d 1172, 1181-82 (9th Cir.2008) (recognizing an exception to the asylum filing deadline when the petitioner shows extraordinary circumstances directly related to the delay).</p>\n<p id=\"b711-24\">2. Although Rivera-Oliva\u2019s asylum was time-barred, he may nevertheless apply for withholding of removal. <em>See Tamang v. Holder, </em>598 F.3d 1083, 1091 (9th Cir. 2010). A person must establish a clear probability of persecution to qualify for withholding of removal. <em>See id. </em>A personal vendetta or revenge does not satisfy this requirement. <em>See Molina-Morales v. INS, </em>237 F.3d 1048, 1051-52 (9th Cir. 2001). This record does not compel the conclusion that Rivera-Oliva would more probably than not be persecuted if he returned to El Salvador. <em>See Kaiser v. Ashcroft, </em>390 F.3d 653, 661 (9th Cir.2004) (articulating standard).</p>\n<p id=\"b711-25\">3. Rivera-Oliva failed to raise before the BIA the argument that he was a mem<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"686\">*686</page-number>ber of a particular social group. Therefore, this argument is unexhausted. <em>See Pagayon v. Holder, </em>675 F.Bd 1182, 1188 (9th Cir.2011) (noting that we only review issues after a petitioner has exhausted all administrative remedies). In any event, Rivera-Oliva failed to establish that he was a member of a particular social group \u201cunited by a voluntary association.\u201d <em>Henriquez-Rivas v. Holder, </em>707 F.3d 1081, 1084 (9th Cir.2013) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b712-4\">4. To qualify for CAT relief, a petitioner must show that it is more likely than not that he would be tortured with the acquiescence of the government if removed to the country of origin. <em>See Zheng v. Ashcroft, </em>332 F.3d 1186, 1194-95 (9th Cir. 2003). Substantial evidence supported the BIA\u2019s determination that Rivera-Oliva was not entitled to CAT protection, because he failed to present evidence of acquiescence of the government of El Salvador. <em>See id. </em>at 1193-95.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-5\">5. To qualify for cancellation of removal a petitioner must establish good moral character for the requisite period. <em>See Camacho-Cruz v. Holder, </em>621 F.3d 941, 942 (9th Cir.2010). The BIA affirmed the ruling by the immigration judge that Rivera-Oliva did not meet the good moral character requirement because he was incarcerated for more than 180 days. <em>See also Arreguin-Moreno v. Mukasey, </em>511 F.3d 1229, 1233 (9th Cir.2008) (explaining that a petitioner cannot meet the good moral character requirement if she served 180 days or more in a penal institution). The record supports the agency\u2019s determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-6\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b711-27\"><em> </em>This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
