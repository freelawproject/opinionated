R.App. P. 34(a)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b702-15\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b702-16\">Arizona state prisoner Lawrence Wade Miles appeals pro se from the district court\u2019s summary judgment in his 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 action alleging that defendants violated his constitutional right to privacy by disclosing his confidential medical records to a third party without his authorization. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review de novo. <em>Brown v. City of Los Angeles, </em>521 F.3d 1238, 1240 (9th Cir.2008) (per curiam). We may affirm on any ground supported by the record. <em>Van Asdale v. Int\u2019l Game Tech., </em>577 F.3d 989, 994 (9th Cir.2009). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-20\">Summary judgment was proper because Miles failed to raise a genuine dispute of material fact as to whether either of the named defendants ordered the release of medical records outside the scope of Miles\u2019s authorization. <em>See Cafasso, U.S. ex rel. v. Gen. Dynamics C4 Sys., Inc., </em>637 F.3d 1047, 1061 (9th Cir.2011) (\u201cTo survive summary judgment, a plaintiff must set forth non-speculative evidence of specific facts, not sweeping conclusory allegations.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b702-21\">The district court did not abuse its discretion in granting defendants\u2019 unopposed motion to stay discovery pending the outcome of the summary judgment motion. <em>See Hallett v. Morgan, </em>296 F.3d 732, 751 (9th Cir.2002) (providing standard of review for district court\u2019s discovery rulings, and explaining that the district court\u2019s discretion to deny discovery \u201cwill not be disturbed except upon the clearest showing that denial of discovery results in actual and substantial prejudice\u201d (citation and internal quotation marks omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b702-22\">Miles\u2019s remaining contentions regarding the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, the Americans with Disabilities Act, and Arizona Revised Statutes sections 31-127 &amp; 128 are unpersuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-23\">Miles\u2019s opposed motion for leave to file a supplemental brief is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-24\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b702-26\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir. R. 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
