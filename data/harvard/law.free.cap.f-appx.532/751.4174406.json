Seven months later, Deedy moved pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1442(a)(1) and \u00a7 1446(c)(1) (amended 2011)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> to remove the case to federal district court. Although he missed the thirty-day filing deadline, Deedy contended that he established \u201cgood cause\u201d for his untimely removal motion because the pre-trial publicity in Hawaii would prejudice his trial and only a federal court could transfer the case to a different state. The district court denied the motion, and Deedy appeals. We affirm.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b777-19\">We review for abuse of discretion a district court\u2019s denial of an untimely removal motion for lack of good cause. <em>See Wei v. Hawaii, </em>763 F.2d 370, 371 (9th Cir.1985) (reviewing for abuse of discretion a district court\u2019s dismissal of a complaint for plaintiffs failure to show good cause in failing to serve the complaint within the prescribed period). A district court abuses its discretion if it makes an error of law, or if its decision is \u201c(1) illogical, (2) implausible, or (3) without support in inferences that may be drawn from the facts in the record.\u201d <em>United States v. Hinkson, </em>585 F.3d 1247, 1262 (9th Cir.2009) (en banc) (internal quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b777-20\">Deedy first argues that the district court committed legal error by stating that \u201cremoval jurisdiction must be strictly construed.\u201d Deedy contends that the court should have taken a more permissive approach to federal officer removal jurisdiction as required by <em>Willingham v. Morgan, </em>395 U.S. 402, 89 S.Ct. 1813, 23 L.Ed.2d 396 (1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b778-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"752\">*752</page-number>Deedy\u2019s argument fails. He ignores the distinction between \u00a7 1442(a)(1) and \u00a7 1446(c)(1). It is correct that courts must liberally construe the substantive elements of federal officer removal jurisdiction under \u00a7 1442(a)(1). <em>See Willingham, </em>395 U.S. at 407, 89 S.Ct. 1813 (rejecting \u201ca narrow, grudging interpretation <em>of \u00a7 1442(a)(1) </em>\u201d) (emphasis added). However, the district court did not base its decision on the substantive requirements for removal under \u00a7 1442(a)(1), but rather on Deedy\u2019s failure to meet the procedural requirements under \u00a7 1446(c)(1). In interpreting a predecessor of \u00a7 1446(c)(1), we held that unlike the substantive provisions of \u00a7 1442(a)(1), the procedural elements of the federal officer removal statutes must be strictly construed. <em>United States ex rel. Walker v. Gunn, </em>511 F.2d 1024, 1026 (9th Cir.1975). The district court made no legal error.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-4\">Next, Deedy asserts that the district court erred in concluding that the adverse pre-trial publicity and the potential need to transfer the case to a different federal district did not constitute good cause to excuse his untimely removal motion. Deedy makes several related arguments that the district court misapplied Fed. R.Crim.P. 21(a) when considering the potential need to transfer the case to a federal district outside of Hawaii. However, Deedy\u2019s arguments misconstrue the district court\u2019s order. The district court did not purport to apply Rule 21(a); the only relevant statement by the court was that the alleged prejudice which might necessitate a transfer was \u201centirely speculative.\u201d Deedy\u2019s arguments about the district court\u2019s alleged misapplication of Rule 21(a) are strawmen that attempt to identify a \u201clegal error\u201d in order to evade abuse of discretion review.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-5\">Additionally, Deedy claims that the record does not support the district court\u2019s statement that he \u201ccould have reasonably anticipated\u201d the negative pretrial publicity within thirty days of his arraignment. This argument fails. The record contains several negative articles published <em>before </em>Deedy\u2019s arraignment, including one reporting claims by the victim\u2019s attorney that Deedy \u201cwas drunk and karate-kicked\u201d the victim before killing him, and another article highlighting the racial tensions in the incident. These facts and others in the record \u201csupport [the] inference[]\u201d of the district court that Deedy should have anticipated future publicity given the immediate attention his case raised in the Hawaiian press. <em>See Hinkson, </em>585 F.3d at 1262. Deedy fails to show that the district court\u2019s holding is otherwise \u201cillogical\u201d or \u201cimplausible.\u201d <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b778-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b777-16\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
