For the reasons that follow, we will dismiss the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-10\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-11\">Because we write primarily for the parties, we discuss the background of this case only briefly. Pelico, a native and citizen of Guatemala, entered the United States in 1991. In 2008, he was placed in removal proceedings and charged with being removable as an alien who is present in the United States without having been admitted or paroled. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(6)(A)\u00ae. After conceding his removability, Pelico applied for cancellation of removal pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b\u00ae).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b215-14\">In March 2011, the IJ issued a written decision denying Pelico\u2019s application. In doing so, the IJ concluded that Pelico was statutorily ineligible for cancellation of removal because he had not established, pursuant to \u00a7 1229b(b)(l)(D), that his removal would result in \u201cexceptional and extremely unusual hardship\u201d to his qualifying relatives. Pelico subsequently appealed the IJ\u2019s decision to the BIA. In December 2012, the BIA dismissed the appeal, agreeing with the IJ\u2019s resolution of Pelico\u2019s application.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-15\">Pelico now seeks review of the agency\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-16\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-17\">Our jurisdiction over the agency\u2019s denial of applications for cancellation of removal is limited. Indeed, \u201c[w]e lack jurisdiction to review discretionary decisions made pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b, including \u2018exceptional and extremely unusual\u2019 hardship determinations.\u201d <em>Patel v. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>619 F.3d 230, 232 (3d Cir.2010) (citing 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B)(i); <em>Mendez-Moranchel v. Ashcroft, </em>338 F.3d 176, 179 (3d Cir.2003)). Although we retain jurisdiction to review constitutional claims or questions of law, <em>Patel, </em>619 F.3d at 232; <em>see 8 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D), that review \u201cis narrowly circumscribed in that it is limited to <em>colorable </em>claims or questions of law.\u201d <em>Pareja v. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>615 F.3d 180, 186 (3d Cir.2010) (emphasis added) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). \u201cTo determine whether a claim is color-able, we ask whether \u2018it is immaterial and made solely for the purpose of obtaining jurisdiction or is wholly insubstantial and frivolous.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Arbaugh v. Y &amp; H </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number><em>Corp., </em>546 U.S. 500, 513 n. 10, 126 S.Ct. 1235, 163 L.Ed.2d 1097 (2006)). In this case, Pelico purports to raise both due process claims and questions of law. We consider them in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-4\">Cancellation of removal is a form of discretionary relief. <em>See Mendez-Reyes v. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>428 F.3d 187, 189 (3d Cir.2005). Although an alien facing removal does not have a due process interest in being considered for discretionary relief, <em>see United States v. Torres, </em>383 F.3d 92, 104-05 (3d Cir.2004), due process does require that his removal proceedings afford him \u201c\u2018the opportunity to be heard at a meaningful time and in a meaningful manner.\u2019 \u201d <em>Abdulai v. Ashcroft, </em>239 F.3d 542, 549 (3d Cir.2001) (quoting <em>Mathews v. Eldridge, </em>424 U.S. 319, 333, 96 S.Ct. 893, 47 L.Ed.2d 18 (1976)). This includes the right to \u201cfact-finding based on a record produced before the decisionmaker and disclosed to him,\u201d the right \u201cto make arguments on his ... own behalf,\u201d and \u201cthe right to an individualized determination of his ... interests.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks and citations omitted). In this case, however, none of Pelico\u2019s purported due process claims makes a colorable showing that the agency infringed upon any of those rights. Accordingly, we lack jurisdiction to consider those claims.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b216-5\">Pelico\u2019s purported questions of law fare no better. His various challenges to the agency\u2019s factual findings, as well as his claim that the agency failed to \u201cfactor[ ]\u201d certain evidence into its decision, do not present a legal question, let alone a color-able one. <em>See Jarbough v. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>483 F.3d 184, 189 (3d Cir.2007). Furthermore, his claim that the agency failed to apply the proper legal standard in adjudicating his application is undeveloped and belied by the record, and thus not colorable. As a result, we lack jurisdiction over these claims as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-8\">Because none of Pelico\u2019s claims presents a colorable constitutional claim or question of law, we must dismiss his petition for review for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b215-13\">. Pelico requested voluntary departure as an alternative form of relief. Although the IJ granted that request, the BIA declined to reinstate that relief when it dismissed his appeal. Because Pelico's brief does not challenge that aspect of the BIA\u2019s decision, we deem the issue waived. <em>See Laborers\u2019 Int\u2019l Union of N. Am., AFL-CIO v. Foster Wheeler Corp., </em>26 F.3d 375, 398 (3d Cir.1994).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b216-6\">. One of those claims contends that the BIA, in reviewing the IJ\u2019s \"exceptional and extremely unusual hardship\u201d determination, should have, sua sponte, taken administrative notice of an earthquake that occurred in Guatemala about one month before the BIA issued its decision. As the Government points out in its brief, Pelico, who was represented by counsel in the proceedings before the agency, could have moved the BIA to remand his case to the IJ for factfinding regarding the impact of that earthquake on his application for cancellation of removal. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1(d)(3)(iv). Alternatively, Pelico could have moved the BIA to reopen the case after the BIA issued its decision. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c). Instead, Pelico chose to do nothing, and the narrow scope of our jurisdiction in cases like this one prohibits us from weighing in on the issue. As a result, we need not reach Pelico's request that we take judicial notice of that earthquake.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
