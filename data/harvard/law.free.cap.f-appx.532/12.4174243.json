We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-21\">\u201cWe review a district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment <em>de novo, </em>construing the evidence in the light most favorable to the non-moving party and drawing all reasonable inferences in its favor.\u201d <em>Allianz Ins. Co. v. Lemer, </em>416 F.3d 109, 113 (2d Cir.2005). Summary judgment is appropriate if \u201cthe movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(a). \u201cWhen the moving party has pointed to the absence of evidence to support an essential element on which the party opposing summary judgment has the burden of proof, the opposing party, in order to avoid <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>summary judgment, must show the presence of a genuine issue by coming forward with evidence that would be sufficient, if all reasonable inferences were drawn in his favor, to establish the existence of that element at trial.\u201d <em>United States v. Rem, </em>38 F.3d 634, 643 (2d Cir.1994) (citing <em>inter alia Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, </em>477 U.S. 317, 322-23, 106 S.Ct. 2548, 91 L.Ed.2d 265 (1986)); <em>see </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b39-5\">Ross alleges that the NCEC discriminated against her on the basis of her gender when it reviewed her application to conduct regulated activities on her property in New Canaan, Connecticut. Specifically, Ross claims that the NCEC subjected her application to greater scrutiny than those of similarly situated male applicants and that hers was the only application ever denied, in violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-6\">\u201cTo state a claim for an equal protection violation, appellants must allege that a government actor intentionally discriminated against them on the basis of race, national origin or gender.\u201d <em>Hayden v. Cnty. of Nassau, </em>180 F.3d 42, 48 (2d Cir. 1999). \u201cState action is impermissible if it perpetuates old gender stereotypes by the disparate treatment of similarly situated men and women based on sex.\u201d <em>Zalewska v. Cnty. of Sullivan, N.Y., </em>316 F.3d 314, 323 (2d Cir.2003) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b39-7\">The district court did not err in granting summary judgment for NCEC because the record contains insufficient evidence to create a genuine issue of fact regarding whether NCEC had a discriminatory motive in denying Ross\u2019s application or whether NCEC treated Ross differently from similarly situated male applicants. As the district court correctly observed, the NCEC meeting minutes do not support Ross\u2019s contention that NCEC subjected her application to a higher level of scrutiny, nor do the minutes demonstrate whether the other applicants were, as Ross asserts, similarly situated. In fact, the record shows that NCEC commissioners considered Ross\u2019s application singularly complex and difficult. <em>See </em>Joint App\u2019x at 155 (\u201c[Tjhis is one of the most difficult applications that has come before the commission in many years.\u201d); <em>id. </em>at 167 (\u201c[Tjhis has been the most difficult application I\u2019ve had to face certainly because there certainly are competing issues here.\u201d); <em>id. </em>at 168 (\u201cThere\u2019s no question that this is a difficult application.\u201d). Furthermore, a single, stray remark by the NCEC chairman calling Ross a \u201ctrifecta\u201d \u2014 which plaintiff alleges means a Hispanic, Jewish woman \u2014 is not enough to create an inference of discriminatory motive, especially when there is no indication in the record when the comment was made or that it was made in connection with her application, and there is no other evidence in the record, circumstantial or otherwise, of discriminatory intent. <em>Cf. Abdu-Brisson v. Delta Air Lines, Inc., </em>239 F.3d 456, 468 (2d Cir.2001) (in age discrimination context, recognizing that \u201cthe stray remarks of a decision-maker, without more\u201d cannot prove a claim of discrimination).</p>\n<p id=\"b39-9\">In sum, no reasonable jury could have concluded based on the record here that NCEC\u2019s actions with regard to Ross\u2019s application were based on her gender, and the district court properly granted NCEC\u2019s motion for summary judgment. For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
