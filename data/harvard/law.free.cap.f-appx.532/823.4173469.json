GORSUCH, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b849-19\">Alan Sudduth was convicted of second degree murder and aggravated robbery by a Colorado state court in 1996. In 2012, he filed a federal habeas petition. The district court denied the petition as untimely. We granted a certificate of appealability permitting Mr. Sudduth to challenge this conclusion, but after careful review we are persuaded it is correct and we affirm the district court and adopt the reasoning it offered in its extensive opinion on the subject.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-20\">Under the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA), an application for federal habeas relief generally must be made within one year from the date on which the conviction became final. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(1)(A). That didn\u2019t happen here. Sixteen years passed between the time when Mr. Sudduth\u2019s conviction became final and his habeas petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-21\">Mr. Sudduth claims that the statute of limitations clock was tolled during much of this period because of his pending motions in state court seeking collateral review. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(2). As documented by the district court, however, many of the filings he cites are not post-conviction motions and are thus insufficient to toll the limitations period. <em>See, e.g., May v. Workman, </em>339 F.3d 1236, 1237 (10th Cir.2003) (motions for transcripts and the like do not stop the limitations clock). But even if we were to overlook this fatal problem, another remains. No matter how generously <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"824\">*824</page-number>we might view Mr. Sudduth\u2019s state court motions and their capacity to stop the clock, two periods of time remain unaccounted for that, when combined, render his federal application untimely: April 24, 1996 to April 26, 1996, and March 14, 2011 to March 14, 2012.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-4\">Mr. Sudduth replies that the former period shouldn\u2019t count against him. He says his conviction didn\u2019t become final for purposes of Colorado law on April 24, 1996 but on May 15, 1996, so the limitations clock didn\u2019t start running until then. By way of support, he cites <em>Leyva v. People, </em>184 P.3d 48, 49 (Colo.2008) (en banc). The difficulty is that the United States Supreme Court has held that for purposes of \u00a7 2254(d)(2) the date a conviction becomes final \u201cis to be determined by reference to a uniform federal rule,\u201d not state law. <em>Clay v. United States, </em>537 U.S. 522, 531, 123 S.Ct. 1072, 155 L.Ed.2d 88 (2003). Under that uniform federal rule, the limitations period generally begins running on \u201cthe date on which the judgment became final by the conclusion of direct review or the expiration of the time for seeking such review.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)(1)(A). When that date precedes AEDPA\u2019s enactment, the general federal rule is that the limitations period begins running on AED-PA\u2019s date of enactment, April 24, 1996. <em>Woodward v. Cline, </em>693 F.3d 1289, 1292 (10th Cir.2012), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 133 S.Ct. 669, 184 L.Ed.2d 475 (2012). Here, it is undisputed that the time for Mr. Sudduth to challenge his conviction through direct appeal expired in March 1996, and therefore the limitations period started on April 24, 1996.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-7\">Mr. Sudduth replies that, even if his motion is untimely as a formal matter the April 1996 dates should not count against him as an equitable matter because he wasn\u2019t aware of AEDPA\u2019s limitations rules. But \u201cit is well established that ignorance of the law, even for an incarcerated pro se petitioner, generally does not excuse prompt filing.\u201d <em>Marsh v. Soares, </em>223 F.3d 1217, 1220 (10th Cir.2000) (internal quotation marks omitted). Alternatively, Mr. Sudduth argues that a letter he wrote to the state courts dated April 26, 1996 amounted to a timely post-conviction motion that tolled the limitations period. But as doubtful as that is, we\u2019ve already assumed as much in our analysis above and it still fails to bring his claim within the limitations period.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-9\">Given that Mr. Sudduth\u2019s habeas application is time barred, we do not need to address the district court\u2019s alternative holding that his federal habeas claim is procedurally defaulted, or Mr. Sudduth\u2019s argument that <em>Martinez v. Ryan, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 132 S.Ct. 1309, 1320, 182 L.Ed.2d 272 (2012), excuses that default. Neither do we understand him as suggesting <em>Martinez </em>alters the operation of the statute of limitations, only the application of procedural default doctrine. The judgment of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b849-16\"> After examining the briefs and appellate record, this panel has determined unanimously that oral argument would not materially assist the determination of this appeal. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 34(a)(2); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument. This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. It may be cited, however, for its persuasive value consistent with Fed. R.App. P. 32.1 and 10th Cir. R. 32.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
