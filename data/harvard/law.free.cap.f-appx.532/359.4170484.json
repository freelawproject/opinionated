Hairston also moves to file a supplemental exhibit, which we grant and consider.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-25\">The district court found that Hairston failed to exhaust his administrative remedies. We have reviewed the record and find that, given the information before the district court, there was no reversible error.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> Accordingly, although we grant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>leave to proceed in forma pauperis, we affirm for the reasons stated by the district court. <em>Hairston v. Wilson, </em>No. 1:13-cv-00126-TSE-IDD (E.D. Va. filed Feb. 5 &amp; entered Feb. 6, 2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b386-4\">We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before this court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-5\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b385-9\"> On appeal, Hairston has presented further evidence regarding exhaustion. While expressing no opinion on whether Hairston has or has not exhausted his administrative remedies, we note that Hairston\u2019s petition was denied without prejudice and, thus, he is free to refile his petition in district court with his additional evidence.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
