MCKAY, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b838-20\">Defendant Vernon Coleman, a federal prisoner proceeding pro se, seeks a certificate of appealability to appeal the district court\u2019s denial of his \u00a7 2255 habeas petition. After an inspection at the Lordsburg Port of Entry revealed 759 pounds of marijuana in the commercial truck Defendant was driving, Defendant was charged with one count of conspiring to possess with the intent to distribute more than 100 kilograms of marijuana, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846, and one count of possessing more than 100 kilograms of marijuana with the intent to distribute it, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841. Defendant moved to suppress the evidence discovered during the investigation and statements he made during a resulting interview, arguing that because he is black, he was the victim of selective enforcement of the law in violation of his Fifth and Fourteenth Amendment rights. The district court denied Defendant\u2019s motion, after which Defendant entered a conditional guilty plea in which he reserved the right to appeal the suppression issue. We affirmed Defendant\u2019s conviction on direct appeal, <em>United States v. Coleman, </em>483 Fed.Appx. 419 (10th Cir. 2012), and the Supreme Court denied certiorari, <em>Coleman v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014 , 133 S.Ct. 360, 184 L.Ed.2d 212 (2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b838-21\">Defendant then filed the instant habeas petition raising two grounds of error: (1) trial counsel was ineffective for failing to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"813\">*813</page-number>argue that the evidence and statements should be suppressed because, although the inspectors had returned Defendant\u2019s paperwork to him and told him he was free to leave, Defendant did not feel free to leave and thus his consent to a further search was invalid; and (2) the district court abused its discretion by denying Defendant\u2019s motion to suppress. The magistrate judge recommended that Defendant\u2019s petition be denied. Specifically, he concluded that Defendant\u2019s counsel\u2019s \u201cperformance did not fall below an objective standard of reasonableness\u201d and, even if it did, Defendant could not show \u201cthat his counsel\u2019s allegedly insufficient performance resulted in prejudice to his defense\u201d because, even if Defendant\u2019s consent to search was invalid, the inspector had probable cause to search Defendant\u2019s tractor-trailer. (R. at 166, 168.) Turning to Defendant\u2019s second claim, the magistrate judge concluded that \u201c[t]his [wa]s the exact issue raised on appeal to the Tenth Circuit.\u201d (R. at 168.) Accordingly, the issue could not be raised in Defendant\u2019s \u00a7 2255 petition absent a change in the law, which Defendant did not argue. <em>See United States v. Warner, </em>28 F.3d 287, 291 (10th Cir.1994). After considering Defendant\u2019s objections to the report and recommendation and conducting a de novo review, the district court adopted the magistrate judge\u2019s recommendation and denied Defendant\u2019s petition. Defendant now seeks a certificate of appealability, raising essentially the same arguments contained in his original petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-4\">After thoroughly reviewing the record and Defendant\u2019s filings on appeal, we conclude that reasonable jurists would not debate 'the district court\u2019s dismissal of Defendant\u2019s petition. <em>See Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000). Therefore, for substantially the same reasons given by the magistrate judge and the district court, we DENY Defendant\u2019s request for a certificate of appealability and DISMISS the appeal.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b838-16\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. It may be cited, however, for its persuasive value consistent with Fed. R.App. P. 32.1 and 10th Cir. R. 32.1.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
