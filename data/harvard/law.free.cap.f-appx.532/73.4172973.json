For the reasons set forth below, we will summarily affirm.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b100-10\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-11\">The facts being well-known to the parties, we set forth only those pertinent to this appeal. Maxberry\u2019s complaint is difficult to comprehend but it appears to allege that Sallie Mae breached its contract with him regarding his student loans to attend the Keller Graduate School in Milwaukee, Wisconsin by declaring him to be in default on the loans and then referring the matter to arbitration before Maxberry actually breached the contract. Maxberry also seems to allege that Defendant Sallie Mae relied upon hearsay evidence and failed to give him notice in determining that he defaulted on his student loans, and that this prevented him from getting his grades and passing his classes at school. Maxberry also alleges that this caused him to be dismissed from school even though he attended class every night and paid $66,000.00 in tuition which he received from Defendant Sallie Mae. He also seems to aver that after he was dismissed from the school, he was immediately charged for the credits he took. Maxberry seeks relief under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1983,1985, and 1986 as well as Title IX of the Education Act of 1972, Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, and \u00a7 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The complaint also appears to contain state law breach of contract and fraud actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-16\">The District Court dismissed all of Max-berry\u2019s federal claims with prejudice and dismissed the state law claims without prejudice \u201cso that Plaintiff can refile them in the proper court.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Maxberry filed a timely notice of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-17\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-18\">We exercise plenary review of the District Court\u2019s decision to dismiss Maxberry\u2019s claims pursuant to \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii). <em>Allah v. Seiverling, </em>229 F.3d 220, 223 (3d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>Cir.2000). In reviewing a district court\u2019s dismissal for failure to state a claim, \u201cwe accept as true all well-pled factual allegations in the complaint and all reasonable inferences that can be drawn from them, and we affirm the order of dismissal only if the pleading does not plausibly suggest an entitlement to relief.\u201d <em>Fellner v. Tri-Union Seafoods, L.L.C., </em>539 F.3d 237, 242 (3d Cir.2008). A district court need not permit amendment of a complaint that is vulnerable to dismissal if amendment would be futile. <em>See, e.g., Phillips v. Cnty. of Allegheny, </em>515 F.3d 224, 236 (3d Cir.2008). We may affirm on any basis supported by the record. <em>See, e.g., Oss Nokalva, Inc. v. European Space Agency, </em>617 F.3d 756, 761 (3d Cir.2010). We are of course mindful that a pro se litigant\u2019s complaint is to be construed liberally. <em>See Haines v. Kerner, </em>404 U.S. 519, 520-21, 92 S.Ct. 594, 30 L.Ed.2d 652 (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b101-5\">To survive a motion to dismiss, a complaint \u2014 even a pro se complaint \u2014 \u201cmust contain sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to \u2018state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ashcroft v. Iqbal, </em>556 U.S. 662, 663, 129 S.Ct. 1937, 173 L.Ed.2d 868 (2009) (quoting <em>Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, </em>550 U.S. 544, 570, 127 S.Ct. 1955, 167 L.Ed.2d 929 (2007)). \u201cA claim has facial plausibility when the plaintiff pleads factual content that allows the court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The facts must demonstrate that the Plaintiff is entitled to relief, not show just a \u201cmere possibility of misconduct.\u201d <em>Fowler v. UPMC Shadyside, </em>578 F.3d 203, 211 (3d Cir.2009) (quoting <em>Iqbal </em>at 679, 129 S.Ct. 1937). \u201c[A]n unadorned, the-defendant-unlawfully-harmed-me accusation\u201d is not sufficient for a complaint to survive a motion to dismiss under Fed. R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6). <em>Iqbal </em>at 678, 129 S.Ct. 1937.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-6\">After analyzing Maxberry\u2019s claims individually, the District Court found that in each instance Maxberry had failed to state a claim and that amendment would be futile. We agree with the District Court\u2019s conclusions, either for the same or substantially similar reasons as given in the Report and Recommendation.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-7\">We affirm the prejudicial dismissal of Maxberry\u2019s claims pursuant to \u00a7 1983, Title IX, and \u00a7 504 of the Rehabilitation Act. While we need not restate the analysis found in the Report and Recommendation, we note that these claims are valid only against a state actor or entity receiving federal assistance, and that Sallie Mae, as a publicly traded corporation, cannot satisfy these requirements. The District Court therefore properly found that amendment would be futile.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-8\">We also affirm the dismissal with prejudice of Maxberry\u2019s Title VI and \u00a7 1985(3) claims. Maxberry\u2019s first mention of the fact that he is African-American, and thus a member of a protected class, occurs in the brief he submitted to this Court upon being notified of possible summary action. He does not allege that Sallie Mae treated him differently than similarly-situated borrowers who were not members of a protected class or that Sallie Mae conspired with anyone before declaring him to be in default. Rather, Maxberry argues only in his brief that \u201cSallie Mae could have notified the plaintiff earlier that they would not allow him to attend but didn\u2019t. Instead they allowed the plaintiff to attend and then did not give ample grades for his work; which ran up the plaintiffs loan amount to that of the present loan amount, and the past in a manner of compulsion.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Brief at 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-9\">Even assuming the truth of these allegations, the pleading requirements of <em>Twombly </em>and <em>Iqbal </em>are not met. Neither the complaint nor the brief adduces any evi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>dence of racially-driven concerted action or animus. Furthermore, we have no reason to believe that an amended complaint would survive a motion to dismiss. Max-berry\u2019s past litigation practices indicate that he is prone to making incomprehensible and unsubstantial filings, and the brief he submitted in this appeal confused rather than clarified the claims raised in his complaint. While we are \u201cmindful that direct evidence of a conspiracy is rarely available and that the existence of a conspiracy must usually be inferred from the circumstances ..., the rule is clear that allegations of a conspiracy must provide some factual basis to support the existence of the elements of a conspiracy: agreement and concerted action.\u201d <em>Capogrosso v. Supreme Ct. of N.J., </em>588 F.3d 180, 184-85 (3d Cir.2009) (quoting <em>Crabtree v. Muchmore, </em>904 F.2d 1475, 1481 (10th Cir. 1990)). Nothing in Maxberry\u2019s filings suggests agreement, concerted action, or discriminatory intent on the part of Sallie Mae. Therefore we agree with the District Court that amendment would be futile.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-4\">A claim under \u00a7 1986 cannot survive without a valid \u00a7 1985(3) claim. <em>See Rogin v. Bensalem Twp., </em>616 F.2d 680, 696 (3d Cir.1980); <em>Brawer v. Horowitz, </em>535 F.2d 830, 841 (3d Cir.1976). Because Maxberry\u2019s \u00a7 1985(3) claim was dismissed with prejudice, the District Court was correct in dismissing his \u00a7 1986 claim with prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-5\">The District Court found that it did not have diversity jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332 because \u201cneither Plaintiff nor Defendant Sallie Mae is a citizen of Pennsylvania.... \u201d This is incorrect, as diversity jurisdiction is not dependent on either party\u2019s being a resident of the forum state. Rather, \u00a7 1332(a)(1) provides that \u201c[t]he district courts shall have original jurisdiction of all civil actions where the matter in controversy exceeds the sum or value of $75,000 ... and is between citizens of different states.\u201d Maxberry\u2019s complaint requests $1 million in damages. Assuming that the required amount of money is indeed in controversy, we conclude that the District Court likely erred in determining that it did not have diversity jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-7\">We can affirm the District Court\u2019s dismissal without prejudice of Maxberry\u2019s state law claims on other grounds, however. Fed.R.Civ.P. 8(a)(2) requires a pleading to contain \u201ca short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief.\u201d As stated above, a complaint \u201cmust contain sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to \u2018state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ashcroft, </em>556 U.S. at 663, 129 S.Ct. 1937 (quoting <em>Bell Atl. Corp., </em>550 U.S. at 570, 127 S.Ct. 1955). The allegations \u201cmust not be \u2018so undeveloped that [the complaint] does not provide a defendant the type of notice of claim which is contemplated by [Fed. R.Civ.P. 8].\u2019\u201d <em>Umland v. PLANCO Fin. Sevs., Inc., </em>542 F.3d 59, 64 (3d Cir.2008) (quoting <em>Phillips v. County of Allegheny, </em>515 F.3d 224, 233 (3d Cir.2008)). In this case, portions of Maxberry\u2019s complaint are difficult to comprehend and border on being unintelligible. Even if the facts Max-berry alleged in the complaint are taken as true, they do not amount to a plausible claim under any cause of action. The complaint therefore does not comply with the requirements of Rule 8 or <em>Twombly. </em>Accordingly, the District Court did not err in dismissing the state law claims without prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-8\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-9\">There being no substantial question presented on appeal, we will summarily affirm.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b100-12\">. We have jurisdiction to hear this appeal pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We may summarily affirm a decision of the District Court if the appeal does not raise a substantial issue.3d Cir.
