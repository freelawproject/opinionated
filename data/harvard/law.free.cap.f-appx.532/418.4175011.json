Based on a total offense level of 31 and a criminal history category of VI, Burnside\u2019s advisory Guidelines range was 188 to 235 months imprisonment. The district court imposed a sentence of 188 months. Burnside appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-8\">Counsel has filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), asserting that there are no meritorious grounds for appeal but questioning whether Burnside\u2019s 188-month sentence is reasonable. Although advised of his right to file a pro se supplemental brief, Burnside has not done so.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-9\">We review a sentence for reasonableness under an abuse of discretion standard. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). This review requires consideration of both the procedural and substantive reasonableness of a sentence. <em>Id.; see United States v. Lynn, </em>592 F.3d 572, 575 (4th Cir.2010). In determining the procedural reasonableness of a sentence, this court considers whether the district court properly calculated the defendant\u2019s Guidelines range, treated the Sentencing Guidelines as advisory, considered the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) (2006) factors, analyzed any arguments presented by the parties, and sufficiently explained the selected sentence. <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 51, 128 S.Ct. 586. A sentence imposed within the properly calculated Guidelines range is presumed reasonable by this court. <em>United States v. Mendoza-Mendoza, </em>597 F.3d 212, 217 (4th Cir.2010), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 131 S.Ct. 3078, 180 L.Ed.2d 900 (2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b445-13\">We find that the sentence imposed by the district court was both procedurally and substantively reasonable. The district court properly calculated Burnside\u2019s sentencing range under the advisory Guidelines, considered the relevant \u00a7 3553(a) factors, and imposed a sentence within the applicable sentencing range. Burnside has not overcome the rebuttable presumption of reasonableness accorded his within-Guidelines sentence. <em>See Rita v. United States, </em>551 U.S. 338, 347, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b445-14\">In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the record in this case and have found no meritorious issues for appeal. We therefore affirm Burnside\u2019s conviction and sentence. This court requires that counsel inform Burnside, in writing, of the right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If Burnside requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on Burnside.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-15\">We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before this court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-16\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
