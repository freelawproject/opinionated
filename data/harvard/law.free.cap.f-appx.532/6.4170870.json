Horn, which denied her application for asylum, withholding of removal, and protection under the Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d). <em>In re Waicella Chandra Puspita, </em>No. A089 198 382 (B.I.A. Sept. 12, 2011), <em>aff'ing, </em>No. A089 198 382 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City Apr. 5, 2010). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-16\">Under the circumstances presented, we review both the IJ\u2019s and the BIA\u2019s decisions \u201cfor the sake of completeness.\u201d <em>Zaman v. Mukasey, </em>514 F.3d 233, 237 (2d Cir.2008) (per curiam)(internal quotation marks omitted). The applicable standards of review are well established. <em>See 8 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>see also Xiu Xia Lin v. Mukasey, </em>534 F.3d 162, 165-66 (2d Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b32-17\">Substantial evidence supports the agency\u2019s determination that Puspita failed to establish a pattern or practice of persecution against ethnic Chinese Christians in Indonesia, thus vitiating her claim of a well-founded fear of future persecution. As the agency observed, record evidence\u2014 and, in particular, recent U.S. State Department reports \u2014 confirms that ethnic and religious conflict has decreased substantially in recent years, and that the Indonesian government has taken noticeable steps to prosecute those responsible for sectarian violence. These facts refute <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>Puspita\u2019s assertion that the Indonesian government is unwilling or unable to control anti-Chinese Christian violence, and are fatal to her pattern-or-practice claim. <em>See Santoso v. Holder, </em>580 F.3d 110, 112 (2d Cir.2009) (identifying no error in agency determination that there is not a pattern or practice of persecution of ethnic Chinese Christians in Indonesia based on U.S. State Department reports).</p>\n<p id=\"b33-5\">In addition, we decline Puspita\u2019s invitation to adopt the \u201cdisfavored group\u201d analysis addressed by the Ninth Circuit in <em>Sael v. Ashcroft, </em>386 F.3d 922, 925 (9th Cir. 2004), which we have consistently refused to adopt in the past, and we conclude that, in general, the BIA\u2019s legal analysis of Pus-pita\u2019s pattern-or-practice claim was proper. Moreover, unlike the situation in <em>Mufied v. Mukasey, </em>508 F.3d 88, 93 (2d Cir.2007), the agency here considered Puspita\u2019s pattern-or-practice claim. For these reasons, the agency did not err by denying Puspita\u2019s claims for asylum and withholding of removal, which were based on the same factual predicate.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>See Paul v. Gonzales, </em>444 F.3d 148, 156 (2d Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b33-6\">The petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b33-8\">. Because Puspita does not challenge the agency\u2019s determination that she failed to demonstrate past persecution or the agency\u2019s denial of her claim for CAT relief, she has abandoned these issues and we decline to consider them. <em>See Yueqing Zhang v. Gonzales, </em>426 F.3d 540, 545 n. 7 (2d Cir.2005).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
