Derrow argues that the district court abused its discretion in denying his \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion based on the retroactive effects of Amendment 750 and the Fair Sentencing Act (FSA). He asserts that Amendment 750 and the FSA effectively raised the threshold amount of crack cocaine necessary to trigger the statutory sentencing range of 10 years to life imprisonment under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841 to 280 grams and that he was responsible for only 50 grams of crack cocaine.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-5\">Section 3582(e)(2) permits the discretionary modification of a defendant\u2019s sentence in certain cases in which the sentencing range has been subsequently lowered by the Sentencing Commission. <em>United States v. Doublin, </em>572 F.3d 235, 237 (5th Cir.2009). The district court\u2019s decision whether to reduce a sentence under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) is reviewed for an abuse of discretion, while the court\u2019s interpretation of the Guidelines is reviewed de novo. <em>United States v. Evans, </em>587 F.3d 667, 672 (5th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b601-6\">Under the amended Guidelines, Derrow was responsible for the equivalent of 13,-626.38 kilograms of marijuana, which results in a base offense level of 36. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(c)(2). After Derrow\u2019s four-level increase based on his role in the offense, his total offense level is calculated at 40. A total offense level of 40, combined with his Category V criminal history score, results in a guidelines range of 360 months to life imprisonment. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. Ch. 5 Pt. A. At the time of Derrow\u2019s original sentencing, he faced the same guidelines range.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-9\">Because Derrow was not eligible for a sentence reduction under \u00a7 3582(c)(2), the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Derrow\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion. <em>See Evans, </em>587 F.3d at 672. Additionally, contrary to Derrow\u2019s assertion, the FSA has no applicability to him because he was sentenced before it took effect. <em>See Dorsey v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 132 S.Ct. 2321, 2335-36, 183 L.Ed.2d 250 (2012); <em>United States v. Doggins, </em>633 F.3d 379, 384 (5th Cir.2011). Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b600-27\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
