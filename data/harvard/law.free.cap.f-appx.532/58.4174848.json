For the reasons discussed below, we will summarily affirm the District Court\u2019s order. <em>See </em>3d Cir. L.A.R. 27.4; I.O.P. 10.6.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-11\">Cope\u2019s amended complaint, although rather opaque, appears to allege that while he was hospitalized at St. Mary\u2019s, some unnamed individuals rifled through the pockets of a shirt he was not wearing, found his bank-account numbers, copied them, and then forwarded that information to the Social Security Administration (SSA). Because of this disclosure, Cope alleges, the SSA realized that he had more than $2,000 in savings, and thus, pursuant to SSA policy, <em>see </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1382, terminated his Supplemental Security Income (SSI). Cope therefore sued various entities associated with St. Mary\u2019s (collectively, \u201cSt. Mary\u2019s\u201d) and individuals and entities associated with the SSA (collectively, \u201cthe SSA\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b85-14\">Cope filed a motion for a default judgment, which the District Court denied. St. Mary\u2019s and the SSA then filed motions to dismiss, which the Court granted. The Court concluded that Cope had failed to plead a federal claim against St. Mary\u2019s, and that to the extent that he did plead a claim, he had failed to raise his right to relief above a speculative level. As to the SSA, the Court held that Cope had failed to exhaust his administrative remedies. Cope then filed a timely notice of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-15\">We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We review the District Court\u2019s denial of Cope\u2019s motion for a default judgment for abuse of discretion, <em>see Chamberlain v. Giampapa, </em>210 F.3d 154, 164 (3d Cir. 2000), and exercise plenary review over the District Court\u2019s order dismissing Cope\u2019s amended complaint, see <em>Allah v. Seiverling, </em>229 F.3d 220, 223 (3d Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b85-16\">As an initial matter, the District Court acted well within its discretion in denying Cope\u2019s motion for a default judgment. Most fundamentally, it appears that both defendants filed their responsive pleadings within the appropriate time after being served, which forecloses Cope\u2019s request for a default judgment. <em>See, e.g., Gold Kist, Inc. v. Laurinburg Oil Co., </em>756 F.2d 14, 19 (3d Cir.1985). Moreover, even if there were any delay, none of the relevant default-judgment factors militate in Cope\u2019s favor \u2014 he was not prejudiced by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>the (hypothetical) delay, there is no indication that the defendants were culpable, and the defendants had litigable defenses. <em>See Chamberlain, </em>210 F.3d at 164. We therefore affirm the District Court\u2019s order as to this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-4\">We further agree with the District Court\u2019s conclusion that Cope failed to plead a viable claim against St. Mary\u2019s. To avoid dismissal, a complaint\u2019s \u201c[factual allegations must be enough to raise a right to relief above the speculative level.\u201d <em>Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, </em>550 U.S. 544, 555, 127 S.Ct. 1955, 167 L.Ed.2d 929 (2007). Just as the complaint in <em>Twombly </em>contained only \u201can allegation of parallel conduct and a bare assertion of conspiracy,\u201d 550 U.S. at 556, 127 S.Ct. 1955, here Cope does not plead facts regarding who actually purloined his account information, when it happened, and how the communications between the individual(s) and the SSA occurred. Nor does the amended complaint contain any corroborating factual averments that the disclosure to the SSA truly happened; rather, Cope seems to assume that because his benefits were terminated, St. Mary\u2019s <em>must </em>have somehow been responsible. \u201c[W]here the well-pleaded facts do not permit the court to infer more than the mere possibility of misconduct, the complaint has alleged \u2014 but it has not \u2018show[n]\u2019 \u2014 \u2018that the pleader is entitled to relief.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ashcroft v. Iqbal, </em>556 U.S. 662, 679, 129 S.Ct. 1937, 173 L.Ed.2d 868 (2009) (quoting Fed.R.Civ.P. 8(a)(2)) (second alteration in original). Accordingly, we will affirm the District Court\u2019s dismissal of the claims against St. Mary\u2019s. <em>See, e.g., W. Run Student Hous. Assocs., LLC v. Huntington Nat\u2019l Bank, </em>712 F.3d 165, 169-70 (3d Cir.2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b86-7\">We also agree with the District Court that Cope failed to exhaust his administrative remedies with respect to any claim that the SSA wrongly terminated his benefits.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In addressing this issue in the context of a motion to dismiss, we may consider both the allegations in Cope\u2019s complaint and the \u201cindisputably authentic documents\u201d that the SSA has provided. <em>Spruill v. Gillis, </em>372 F.3d 218, 223 (3d Cir.2004). To exhaust administrative remedies, a claimant must seek review by an Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) and then the Appeals Council. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 416.1400(a), 416.1429. Here, Cope acknowledges in his amended complaint that he did not appeal the SSA\u2019s adverse decision to an ALJ, which is confirmed by the authentic records that the SSA presented. Therefore, Cope has not exhausted his administrative remedies. Moreover, he has not given any indication \u2014 even after being given the opportunity to re-plead \u2014 that exhaustion would be futile. <em>See, e.g., Fitzgerald v. Apfel, </em>148 F.3d 232, 234 (3d Cir.1998). Hence, we also affirm the District Court\u2019s disposition of this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-8\">Finally, Cope complains that the District Court resolved these matters on the papers without holding oral argument. The District Court has discretion as to whether to hold a hearing. <em>See Dougherty v. Harper\u2019s Magazine Co., </em>537 F.2d 758, 761 (3d Cir.1976); <em>see also </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 78. Here, Cope was accorded several opportunities to be heard: the District Court ordered him to respond to the motions to dismiss and invited him to amend his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>amended complaint, and he did in fact file several letters and memoranda in the District Court. In these circumstances, it was not an abuse of discretion for the District Court to determine that an oral hearing was unnecessary to determine, as a legal matter, whether Cope\u2019s amended complaint adequately stated a claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-5\">Accordingly, we will summarily affirm the District Court\u2019s order. <em>See </em>3d Cir. L.A.R. 27.4; I.O.P. 10.6.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b85-12\">. The District Court dismissed Cope\u2019s amended complaint without prejudice, and provided him 30 days to re-plead. Cope, however, has elected to stand on his original complaint rather than amend or refile it, and the order dismissing the complaint without prejudice is therefore final. <em>See, e.g., Batoff v. State Farm Ins. Co., </em>977 F.2d 848, 851 n. 5 (3d Cir.1992).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b86-5\"><em>. </em>The requirement in 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g) that the plaintiff must complete the agency review process is non-jurisdictional and may be waived. <em>See Bowen v. City of New York, </em>476 U.S. 467, 483, 106 S.Ct. 2022, 90 L.Ed.2d 462 (1986). Therefore, the District Court should have relied on Rule 12(b)(6), rather than Rule 12(b)(1), in dismissing the complaint. <em>See Anjelino v. N.Y. Times Co., </em>200 F.3d 73, 87 (3d Cir.1999). Accordingly, \"we will test the exhaustion ... defensef ] under Rule 12(b)(6).\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 87-88.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
