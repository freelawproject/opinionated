After his direct appeals failed, Ingram initiated state habeas proceedings. The primary issue in those proceedings was whether the prosecutor violated Ingram\u2019s rights under <em>Brady v. Maryland, </em>373 U.S. 83, 83 S.Ct. 1194, 10 L.Ed.2d 215 (1963), by failing to disclose evidence relating to two extramarital affairs that Smith engaged in five and eight years prior to the sexual assault by Ingram. After holding several evidentiary hearings on the issue, the state habeas court recommended that relief be denied. On September 10, 2008, the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals issued an order denying relief without a written opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-19\">On November 10, 2008, Ingram, proceeding pro se, filed a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 habeas petition in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Texas, asserting multiple bases for relief. Defendant Rick Thaler, the Director of the Correctional Institutions Division of the Texas Department of Criminal Justice, moved for summary judgment. The district judge granted Thaler\u2019s summary judgment motion in a thorough and well-reasoned eighty-page opinion. Ingram filed a timely notice of appeal and a motion for a certificate of appealability. Our court granted a certificate of appealability as to Ingram\u2019s claims that: (1) \u201chis right to present a complete defense was violated by the exclusion of evidence of the complainant\u2019s previous extramarital affairs,\u201d (2) \u201cthe prosecution used improper methods to secure his conviction,\u201d (3) \u201cthe prosecution violated <em>Brady v. Maryland, </em>373 U.S. 83, 83 S.Ct. 1194, 10 L.Ed.2d 215 (1963), by failing to disclose evidence favorable to the defense,\u201d and (4) the district court erred by denying Ingram an evidentiary hearing. Ingram filed a pro se brief and Thaler filed a response.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-20\">On December 12, 2011, this court sua sponte appointed counsel for Ingram and requested new briefing. In his new brief, Ingram abandoned his arguments that prosecutorial misconduct, the inability to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>present a complete defense, and the failure to grant an evidentiary hearing provide independent bases for habeas relief. Instead, Ingram focused on the argument that the prosecutor\u2019s failure to disclose evidence of Smith\u2019s extramarital affairs violated his rights under <em>Brady </em>and the state court\u2019s decision concluding otherwise was an \u201cunreasonable application\u201d of Supreme Court precedent. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b502-4\">The Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (\u201cAEDPA\u201d) \u201cprohibits federal habeas relief for any claim adjudicated on the merits in state court, unless one of the exceptions listed in \u00a7 2254(d) obtains.\u201d <em>Premo v. Moore, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 131 S.Ct. 733, 739, 178 L.Ed.2d 649 (2011). \u201cUnder \u00a7 2254(d), a federal court may not grant habeas relief on such claims unless the state court\u2019s decision (1) was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States; or (2) was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the State court proceeding.\u201d <em>Cobb v. Thaler, </em>682 F.3d 364, 372-73 (5th Cir.2012) (internal quotation marks omitted). A state court\u2019s decision is deemed an \u201cunreasonable\u201d application of Supreme Court precedent for purposes of AEDPA when the state court \u201ccorrectly identifies the governing legal rule but applies it unreasonably to the facts of a particular prisoner\u2019s case.\u201d <em>Gregory v. Thaler, </em>601 F.3d 347, 352 (5th Cir.2010) (internal quotation marks omitted). The state court\u2019s application of Supreme Court case law \u201cmust be objectively unreasonable, not merely erroneous or incorrect.\u201d <em>Cobb, </em>682 F.3d at 373 (internal quotation marks omitted). A state court\u2019s determination that a claim lacks merit is not objectively unreasonable \u201cso long as fairminded jurists could disagree on the correctness of the state court\u2019s decision.\u201d <em>Harrington v. Richter, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 131 S.Ct. 770, 786, 178 L.Ed.2d 624 (2011) (internal quotation marks omitted); <em>see also Felkner v. Jackson, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 131 S.Ct. 1305, 1307, 179 L.Ed.2d 374 (2011) (\u201cAEDPA imposes a highly deferential standard for evaluating state-court rulings and demands that state-court decisions be given the benefit of the doubt.\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b502-10\">After careful review of the parties\u2019 arguments, the applicable law, and the pertinent portions of the record, we agree with the district court\u2019s conclusions that Ingram\u2019s <em>Brady </em>claim fails under the standard set forth by AEDPA and that Thaler was entitled to summary judgment. To establish a <em>Brady </em>claim, one must show that: \u201c(1) the prosecution suppressed evidence, (2) the evidence was favorable to the defense, and (3) the evidence was material.\u201d <em>LaCaze v. Warden La. Corr. Inst. for Women, </em>645 F.3d 728, 735 (5th Cir. 2011). Evidence is material for purposes of <em>Brady </em>\u201conly if there is a reasonable probability that, had the evidence been disclosed to the defense, the result of the proceeding would have been different.\u201d <em>Cobb, </em>682 F.3d at 378. When the test for <em>Brady </em>materiality is combined with the AEDPA standard of review, the question in this case becomes whether reasonable jurists could disagree about the correctness of the state court\u2019s decision that disclosure of the evidence of Smith\u2019s affairs would not have created a reasonable probability of a different result at trial. <em>See Harrington, </em>131 S.Ct. at 786. For the reasons explained in the district court\u2019s thorough opinion, the answer to that question is clearly \u201cyes.\u201d Accordingly, the judgment is AFFIRMED, essentially for the reasons stated by the district court. Ingram\u2019s motion to file an out of time pro se reply brief is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b501-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
