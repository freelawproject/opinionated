We will deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-22\">Barros-Suarez is a citizen of Ecuador. In 1998, he was admitted into the United States as a lawful permanent resident. In 2000, a Pennsylvania jury found him guilty of third-degree murder, 18 Pa. Cons.Stat. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>Ann. \u00a7 2502(c), and carrying a firearm without a license, 18 Pa. Cons.Stat. Ann. \u00a7 6106(a). He was sentenced to a prison term of between 20 and 40 years on the murder conviction, and a consecutive prison term of between one and five years on the firearm conviction. Barros-Suarez\u2019s direct appeals failed, as have his subsequent attempts to obtain collateral relief in both state and federal court.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-5\">Following his convictions, the Government initiated removal proceedings against Barros-Suarez. The Immigration Judge (\u201cIJ\u201d) found him removable on two independent grounds: (1) under INA \u00a7 237(a)(2)(C), based on his conviction for carrying a firearm without a license; and (2) under INA \u00a7 237(a)(2)(A)(iii), based on his conviction for third-degree murder, which the IJ concluded constituted the aggravated felony of \u201cmurder\u201d within the meaning of INA \u00a7 101(a)(43)(A). On appeal, Barros-Suarez only disputed the IJ\u2019s conclusion that his third-degree murder conviction constituted a \u201cmurder\u201d conviction within the meaning of INA \u00a7 101(a)(43)(A). He contended that removability based on \u00a7 101(a)(43)(A) requires a conviction for an intentional murder.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b219-7\">The BIA dismissed the appeal, explaining that it was unnecessary to reach the merits of Barros-Suarez\u2019s argument because he did not challenge the IJ\u2019s separate finding that he was also removable under INA \u00a7 237(a)(2)(C), based on his firearm conviction, and did \u201cnot assert that he is eligible for any form of relief.\u201d The BIA noted that if it were to reach BarrosSuarez\u2019s argument, however, it would affirm the IJ\u2019s conclusion that he was also removable under INA \u00a7\u00a7 237(a)(2)(A)(iii) and 101(a)(43)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b219-11\">Barros-Suarez filed a pro se petition for review in this Court, renewing his argument that his third-degree murder conviction is not a conviction for \u201cmurder\u201d within the meaning of INA \u00a7 101(a)(43)(A) because it lacks an intent element, and therefore the IJ erred by finding him removable under INA \u00a7 237(a)(2)(A)(iii). His brief further argues that he is not removable under INA \u00a7 101(a)(43)(F), because he was not convicted of a \u201ccrime of violence,\u201d and also advances arguments collaterally attacking his convictions. Once again, he does not dispute removability under INA \u00a7 237(a)(2)(C), based on his conviction for carrying a firearm without a license. He also filed a motion for a stay of removal accompanying his petition, which we denied on March 26, 2013.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-12\">We have jurisdiction to review the BIA\u2019s final order under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(1). Our jurisdiction is limited to reviewing \u201cconstitutional claims and questions of law.\u201d <em>See </em>INA \u00a7 242(a)(2)(D); <em>Papageorgiou v. Gonzales, </em>413 F.3d 356, 358 (3d Cir.2005). Here, the question of law presented by Barros-Suarez\u2019s petition is that his state conviction for third-degree murder is not a basis for removal under INA \u00a7\u00a7 101(a)(43)(A) and 237(a)(2)(A)(iii) because that crime lacks the necessary element of intent for \u201cmurder.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"ASE\">We agree with the BIA that BarrosSuarez cannot obtain any relief based on this claim because even if we agreed with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>his argument,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> he has never challenged his removability on the separate basis of INA \u00a7 237(a)(2)(C). We decline to consider Barros-Suarez\u2019s argument relating to his removability under INA \u00a7 101(a)(43)(F), because that ground was not addressed by the BIA. <em>See Kayembe v. Ashcroft, </em>334 F.3d 231, 234 (3d Cir.2003). We also do not consider Barros-Suarez\u2019s arguments which appear to collaterally attack his convictions because they are irrelevant for purposes of these proceedings. <em>See Paredes v. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>528 F.3d 196, 198-99 (3d Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b220-4\">Accordingly, the petition for review will be denied.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b219-8\">. He also argued that he was not removable on the basis of having been convicted of a \"crime of violence\" under INA \u00a7 101(a)(43)(F). The BIA did not address that argument because although the Government had filed Additional Charges of Inadmissibility/Deportability (Form 1-261) charging Barros-Suarez as removable based on the \"crime of violence\u201d provision in INA \u00a7 101(a)(43)(F), the IJ\u2019s decision did not address that charge.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b219-14\">. The Government has filed a motion to dismiss the petition for lack of jurisdiction on the ground that Barros-Suarez failed to exhaust his administrative remedies with respect to challenging his removability under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>INA \u00a7 237(a)(2)(C), and therefore this Court lacks jurisdiction to consider any ground upon which he may be afforded relief. We will deny this motion because the petition for review presents a question of law with respect to the IJ\u2019s determination that Barros-Suarez is also removable under 237(a)(2)(A)(iii). The record reflects that Barros-Suarez has properly exhausted a challenge to that finding.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b220-15\">. In his reply brief, Barros-Suarez argues that we should decide whether his Pennsylvania conviction for third-degree murder is an aggravated felony under INA \u00a7 10l(a)(43)(A), because his eligibility for cancellation of removal depends upon resolution of the issue. We decline to decide the issue, as he did not apply for cancellation of removal before the IJ. <em>See </em>INA \u00a7 240A(a)(3). We note, however, that a recent BIA decision holds that the term \"murder\u201d in \u00a7 101 (a) (43) (A) includes more than intentional murder. <em>See In re M-W-, </em>25 I. &amp; N. Dec. 748, 759 (BIA 2012).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
