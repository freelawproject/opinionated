Stein, District Judge for the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b790-22\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b790-23\">Marc Sadi Vogel and We Lend More, Inc., appeal their convictions for unlawful transportation of hazardous waste, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 6928(d)(1), unlawful disposal of hazardous waste, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 6928(d)(2)(A), and transportation of hazardous waste without a manifest, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 6928(d)(5). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-24\">The decision to exclude a particular piece of evidence is reviewed for abuse of discretion. <em>See United States v. Decoud, </em>456 F.3d 996, 1010 (9th Cir.2006). All of the evidence Vogel requested came in at trial except absent codefendant Raul Gonzalez-Lopez\u2019s 1992 conviction for possession of a controlled substance with intent to sell. Given that conviction\u2019s minimal relevance to the instant case, the district court did not abuse its discretion in excluding it.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-25\">Vogel did not request a jury instruction on evidence of flight of a co-defendant, and so his challenge is subject to plain error review. <em>United States v. Kilbride, </em>584 F.3d 1240, 1247 (9th Cir.2009). There was no plain error here. The Ninth Circuit Model Criminal Jury Instructions \u201cgenerally recommend[] against giving specific inference instructions in such areas as flight or concealment of identity because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"765\">*765</page-number>the general instruction on direct and circumstantial evidence is sufficient.\u201d 9th Cir. Model Crim. Jury Inst. 4.17 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b791-5\">The district court\u2019s jury instructions did not apply the wrong mens rea standard. The law does not require a heightened mens rea standard for lay persons in hazardous waste cases. <em>See United States v. Int\u2019l Minerals &amp; Chem. Corp., </em>402 U.S. 558, 568, 91 S.Ct. 1697, 29 L.Ed.2d 178 (1971). Nor did the district court improperly instruct the jury regarding the mistake-of-fact defense. The district court instructed the jury that if it had \u201ca reasonable doubt about whether the defendants had the requisite knowledge or intent[ ] because of their mistake\u201d of fact, it must find them not guilty. This adequately represented defendants\u2019 theory of the case. <em>See United States v. Lopez-Alvarez, </em>970 F.2d 583, 597 (9th Cir.1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b791-6\">We Lend More\u2019s convictions need not be reversed even though the government did not introduce evidence of the company\u2019s corporate status. We Lend More\u2019s corporate status is not an element of any charged offense, and the company\u2019s trade name (We Lend More, Inc.) provides adequate evidence of its corporate status in any event. <em>See United States v. Scoblick, </em>225 F.2d 779, 782-83 (3d Cir.1955) (finding that, absent an objection, testimony describing a trade name including \u201cInc.\u201d \u201cwas sufficient to show ... corporate identity\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b791-7\">Finally, because there was no error, there was no cumulative error warranting reversal. <em>United States v. Romo-Chavez, </em>681 F.3d 955, 962 (9th Cir.2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b791-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b790-26\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
