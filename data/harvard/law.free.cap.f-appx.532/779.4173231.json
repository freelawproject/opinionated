Hernandez contends that the IJ and the BIA erred in finding that she had acted \u201cfor commercial advantage\u201d within the meaning of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101 (a)(43)(K)(ii) when she committed a federal prostitution offense, and therefore erred in classifying her offense as an aggravated felony. She also contends that the IJ unfairly precluded her from presenting evidence negating the inference of commercial advantage. Our disposition of the second issue obviates the need to address the first.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-7\">In September 2004, Hernandez was charged in a four-count indictment with conspiracy to smuggle and transport illegal aliens, transportation in furtherance of prostitution, bringing illegal aliens to the United States for financial gain, and smuggling illegal aliens. Hernandez ultimately pleaded guilty in September 2005 to the charge of transportation in furtherance of prostitution, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2421. She was sentenced for this offense to six months of imprisonment, followed by three years of supervised release, and was ordered to pay a $5,000 fine.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-8\">When Hernandez was initially indicted, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) commenced removal proceedings against her. The DHS subsequently alleged, based on Hernandez\u2019s September 2005 guilty plea, that Hernandez was removable from the United States under \u00a7 237(a)(2)(A)(iii) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii), because she had been convicted of an aggravated felony as defined in INA \u00a7 101 (a)(43)(K)(ii), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(K)(ii). According to the DHS, Hernandez\u2019s conviction for transportation in furtherance of prostitution under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2421 amounted to an aggravated felony because she committed that offense \u201cfor commercial advantage\u201d within the meaning of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101 (a) (43) (K) (ii).</p>\n<p id=\"b806-13\">Hernandez\u2019s case came before an IJ on her motion to terminate the removal proceedings. In September 2007, the IJ granted the motion to terminate, finding that the government had not sustained its burden of proving by clear and convincing evidence that Hernandez committed the prostitution offense for commercial advantage. This ruling was grounded in the IJ\u2019s conclusion that the Supreme Court\u2019s decisions in <em>Taylor v. United States, </em>495 U.S. 575, 110 S.Ct. 2143, 109 L.Ed.2d 607 (1990), and <em>Shepard v. United States, </em>544 U.S. 13, 125 S.Ct. 1254, 161 L.Ed.2d 205 (2005), as well as this court\u2019s decision in <em>Tokatly v. Ashcroft, </em>371 F.3d 613 (9th Cir.2004), required that the inquiry as to whether Hernandez committed the prostitution offense for commercial advantage be limited to her record of conviction. The IJ therefore refused to consider the government\u2019s evidence in the form of a Presentence Report (PSR) and the deposition testimony of Hernandez\u2019s smuggling confederate Ki Pil (or Kipil) Hong. Her<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"781\">*781</page-number>nandez was accordingly found not removable because the record of her conviction, considered without regard to any extraneous evidence, did not support a finding of commercial advantage.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-5\">The BIA reversed, holding that \u201cthe Immigration Judge should have looked beyond [Hernandez\u2019s] record of conviction to determine whether her 2005 offense was committed for \u2018commercial advantage.\u2019\u201d <em>See Nijhawan v. Holder, </em>557 U.S. 29, 32, 129 S.Ct. 2294, 174 L.Ed.2d 22 (2009) (holding that when the definition of an aggravated felony contains a requirement, such as the commercial-advantage requirement, that is not an element of the underlying crime, but rather \u201crefers to the particular circumstances in which an offender committed\u201d the crime, courts may go beyond the alien\u2019s record of conviction to determine whether the government has satisfied its burden of proving that requirement); <em>see also Kawashima v. Holder, </em>615 F.3d 1043 (9th Cir.2010) (acknowledging that <em>Nijhawan </em>permits an inquiry beyond the four corners of the record of conviction).</p>\n<p id=\"b807-6\">The BIA therefore remanded the ease for a determination of whether, in light of the government\u2019s submitted evidence, Hernandez committed the prostitution offense for commercial advantage. \u201cUpon remand,\u201d wrote the BIA, Hernandez \u201cshould be given an opportunity to present new evidence, including any evidence that may contradict the Pre-Sentence Report, which indicates that the respondent received $2,500 for transporting a Korean national for the purpose of prostitution.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b807-7\">The key question on this petition for review is whether Hernandez was in fact given an opportunity to do so. In this respect, the transcript of the hearing before the IJ on remand is ambiguous. The transcript could be interpreted to indicate that Hernandez\u2019s counsel affirmatively declined to present any evidence beyond the record of conviction. But the transcript could just as reasonably be interpreted to indicate that counsel was awaiting a scheduled (and subsequently canceled) evidentiary hearing before submitting extra-record evidence to negate any proof of commercial advantage.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-9\">We are inclined to give counsel, who is a seasoned immigration attorney, the benefit of the doubt. After all, an evidentiary hearing was called for by the Immigration Court Practice Manual, had been scheduled in this case, and was the only reason that the BIA remanded the case to the IJ in the first place. We therefore direct that this case be again remanded to the IJ for the submission of evidence by both the government and Hernandez on the commercial-advantage issue. Obviously, our decision to remand should not be taken as expressing any opinion on the merits of Hernandez\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-10\">Petition GRANTED; case REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b806-14\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
