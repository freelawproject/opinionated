Chambers appeals from the District Court\u2019s order dismissing his com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>plaint. For the following reasons, we will dismiss the appeal as frivolous.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-6\">Chambers, a Pennsylvania prisoner, filed a pro se civil rights lawsuit pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988. Chambers is seeking monetary damages stemming from an alleged wrongful arrest and murder conviction in 2003 and 2005, respectively. The United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania granted Chambers\u2019s in forma pauperis (\u201cIFP\u201d) application and evaluated the complaint pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2). The District Court dismissed the case as frivolous and for failure to state a claim. Chambers timely appealed and moves for us to appoint counsel for the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-8\">We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we exercise plenary review over the District Court\u2019s dismissal. <em>See Allah v. Seiverling, </em>229 F.3d 220, 223 (3d Cir.2000). To survive dismissal for failure to state a claim, a plaintiffs complaint must \u201ccontain sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to \u2018state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ashcroft v. Iqbal, </em>556 U.S. 662, 678, 129 S.Ct. 1937, 173 L.Ed.2d 868 (2009) (quoting <em>Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, </em>550 U.S. 544, 570, 127 S.Ct. 1955, 167 L.Ed.2d 929 (2007)). We will dismiss the appeal as frivolous pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(i), as it lacks an arguable basis either in law or fact. <em>See Neitzke v. Williams, </em>490 U.S. 319, 325, 109 S.Ct. 1827, 104 L.Ed.2d 338 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b113-9\">The District Court correctly noted that Chambers\u2019s claims are frivolous because the defendants, which include the trial court judge, witnesses, and Chambers\u2019s public defender attorneys, cannot be sued under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. Specifically, judges are immune from suit under \u00a7 1983 for monetary damages arising from their judicial acts, <em>see Gallas v. Supreme Court of Pa., </em>211 F.3d 760, 768 (3d Cir.2000), and witnesses are immune from suit with respect to any claim based on the witnesses\u2019 testimony, <em>see McArdle v. Tronetti, </em>961 F.2d 1083, 1085 (3d Cir.1992). Public defenders are not state actors for \u00a7 1983 purposes because they are not acting under the color of state law when performing the traditional functions as counsel to a defendant in a criminal proceeding. <em>See Polk Cnty. v. Dodson, </em>454 U.S. 312, 325, 102 S.Ct. 445, 70 L.Ed.2d 509 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b113-10\">Furthermore, in order for a prisoner to recover damages under \u00a7 1983 where the award would imply the invalidity of the conviction, he must prove that the conviction or sentence has already been invalidated. <em>See Heck v. Humphrey, </em>512 U.S. 477, 486-87, 114 S.Ct. 2364, 129 L.Ed.2d 383 (1994). Because Chambers\u2019s conviction has not been invalidated, his claims are barred. Chambers appears to argue that conflicting evidence was presented at his trial, but that is a question for the fact finder, not this Court. Additionally, Chambers has incorrectly attempted to use \u00a7 1983 to challenge his convictions when such challenges are only cognizable in habeas proceedings after exhausting state remedies as required by 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(b) and (c). <em>See Preiser v. Rodriguez, </em>411 U.S. 475, 500, 93 S.Ct. 1827, 36 L.Ed.2d 439 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b114-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>For the reasons given, we agree with the District Court\u2019s determination and we will dismiss Chambers\u2019s appeal as legally frivolous pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)\u00ae. <em>See Neitzke v. Williams, </em>490 U.S. 319, 325, 109 S.Ct. 1827, 104 L.Ed.2d 338 (1989). Furthermore, Chambers\u2019s motion to appoint counsel is dismissed as moot.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
