Jackson challenges the drug quantity determination that was made at his original sentencing. He also contends that the district court found at his original sentencing hearing that he was responsible for 1.5 kilograms of crack cocaine and that this quantity results in a reduction under the amended Guidelines. He relies upon <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), and <em>Kimbrough v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 85, 128 S.Ct. 558, 169 L.Ed.2d 481 (2007), and contends that re-sentencing is warranted in his case due to the disparity in sentencing among offenses involving cocaine and crack cocaine.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-6\">Section 3582(c)(2) permits the discretionary modification of a defendant\u2019s sentence \u201cin the case of a defendant who has been sentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d \u00a7 3582(c)(2); U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(a)(l) (2012). The district court\u2019s decision whether to reduce a sentence under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) is reviewed for an abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Evans, </em>587 F.3d 667, 672 (5th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b608-7\">Jackson\u2019s reliance on <em>Booker </em>and <em>Kimbrough </em>is misplaced, as \u00a7 3582(c)(2) only applies to amendments that result in lowering a defendant\u2019s guidelines range. <em>See Dillon v. United States, </em>560 U.S. 817, \u2014, 130 S.Ct. 2683, 2691-94, 177 L.Ed.2d 271 (2010); \u00a7 lB1.10(a)(2)(B). Moreover, the district court at sentencing determined that Jackson was responsible for more than 40 kilograms of cocaine base. Accordingly, Jackson\u2019s base offense level of 38 is not modified by Amendment 750, because the amendment results in a base offense level of 38 for offenses involving \u201c8.4 KG or more of Cocaine Base.\u201d \u00a7 2Dl.l(c)(l) (2012). Jackson\u2019s remaining arguments are simply an attempt to relitigate drug quantity. Issues that relate to original sentencing determinations may not be relitigated in a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceeding. <em>Evans, </em>587 F.3d at 674.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b608-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
