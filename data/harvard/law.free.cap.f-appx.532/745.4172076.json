The district court\u2019s order enjoined the Estate Defendants from dismissing or accepting settlement of the Estate\u2019s claims against certain medical services providers without the written consent of the Plan, other than for amounts \u201cabove and beyond the reasonable value of services and benefits the Plan provided to Lancaster.\u201d <em>Norstan Inc. v. Lancaster, </em>12-cv-00481-GMS, 2012 WL 3155575, at *5 (D.Ariz. Aug. 3, 2012). We affirm.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b771-19\">The Estate Defendants argue that the district court had no jurisdiction to issue the injunction and that the Estate is not bound by the ERISA plan documents because the Estate is not a \u201ccovered person\u201d under the terms of the ERISA plan. These arguments are without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-20\">Whether a party is \u201ccovered\u201d under the terms of an ERISA plan \u201cis a substantive element of [the] claim, not a prerequisite for subject matter jurisdiction.\u201d <em>Leeson v. Transamerica Disability Income Plan, </em>671 F.3d 969, 971 (9th Cir.2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b771-21\">The only argument raised by the Estate Defendants in opposition to the preliminary injunction is that the Estate is not a \u201ccovered person,\u201d but they waived this argument by not raising it to the district <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"746\">*746</page-number>court. Even if it was not waived, the plan documents\u2019 definition of \u201ccovered person\u201d clearly includes the Estate.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b772-4\">The order of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b771-16\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir. R. 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b772-17\">.
