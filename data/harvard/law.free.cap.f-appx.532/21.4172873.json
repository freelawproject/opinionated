He now appeals the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment. We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the facts and history of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-7\">In his opposition to summary judgment, Muhammad asserted claims under Title VII and the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). However, he advanced no facts that could support his claim of discrimination on account of disability, race, or gender. Walmart\u2019s different treatment of a female employee failed to support gender discrimination, in part, because they were not similarly situated. Unlike Muhammad, the female employee had not acted abusively to a manager or to any other Walmart employee. His abusive outburst at his supervisor gave Walmart a legitimate reason to fire him and Muhammad failed to produce any evidence that his termination was carried out for improper motives. Muhammad\u2019s ADA claims also fail. Walmart\u2019s accommodations were \u201cplainly reasonable,\u201d and Muhammad did not engage in any protected activity to trigger a retaliation claim. <em>Wernick v. Fed. Reserve Bank of N.Y., </em>91 F.3d 379, 385 (2d Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b48-9\">Accordingly, we AFFIRM the judgment of the district court. Walmart\u2019s motion for attorney\u2019s fees and costs is DENIED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
