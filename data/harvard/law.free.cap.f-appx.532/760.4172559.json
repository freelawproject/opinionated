We have jurisdiction pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a) and deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-9\">The BIA found no clear error in the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination. We agree. The adverse credibility determination was supported by substantial evidence, <em>INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 481, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992); <em>Monjaraz-Munoz v. INS, </em>327 F.3d 892, 895 (9th Cir.2003), which included Cao\u2019s unreliable testimony about her residency, employment, and surgery; questionable documentary evidence; failure to corroborate documentary evidence with testimony from her husband and family relative, both of whom were living in the United States, and to explain their inability to testify, <em>see Sidhu v. INS, </em>220 F.3d 1085, 1092 (9th Cir.2000); and lack of specificity in her declaration, <em>cf. Aguilera-Cota v. INS, </em>914 F.2d 1375, 1382 (9th Cir.1990) (explaining that an applicant\u2019s \u201cfailure to file an application form that was as complete as might be desired cannot, <em>without more, </em>properly serve as the basis for a finding of a lack of credibility\u201d (emphasis added)). Accordingly, the BIA\u2019s conclusion that the IJ properly relied upon these factors when rendering an adverse credibility determination under the REAL ID Act, <em>see </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(l)(B)(iii) (requiring that credibility determinations be based upon a \u201ctotality of the circumstances, and all relevant factors\u201d), and dismissal of Cao\u2019s petition were not erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-13\">Furthermore, Cao has waived her due process claim and any challenge to the BIA\u2019s denial of CAT protection by failing to argue these issues in her opening brief. <em>Martinez-Serrano v. INS, </em>94 F.3d 1256, 1259 (9th Cir.1996). Our unwillingness to review these issues does not result in manifest injustice. <em>United States v. Loya, </em>807 F.2d 1483, 1487 (9th Cir.1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b787-14\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b787-16\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
