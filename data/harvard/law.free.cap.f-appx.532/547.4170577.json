We held that \u201cthe split amongst the circuit courts of appeals on the issue\u201d of whether it is improper for a district court to rely on 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A) for the modification or revocation of a supervised release term, \u201crendered any consideration of the \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A) factors neither clear nor obvious legal error.\u201d <em>United States v. Davis, </em>454 Fed.Appx. 383, 385 (5th Cir.) (per curiam) (unpublished). The Supreme Court vacated and remanded our judgment for further consideration in light of <em>Henderson v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 133 S.Ct. 1121, 185 L.Ed.2d 85 (2013). In <em>Henderson, </em>the Supreme Court held that an error is plain within the meaning of Rule 52(b) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure when the error is plain at the time of appellate review. <em>Id. </em>at 1124-25.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-7\">On remand, Davis contends that this court should vacate the district court\u2019s judgment and remand for re-sentencing because our decision in <em>United States v. Miller, </em>634 F.3d 841 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 132 S.Ct. 496, 181 L.Ed.2d 345 (2011), makes it \u201cplain\u201d that the district court improperly considered \u201cpunishment\u201d under \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A), when it imposed sentence on Davis after revoking his terms of supervised release. The government responds that Davis\u2019s supervised release terms were revoked, in part, under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(g), which does not limit the sentencing factors a court may consider in fashioning a sentence. For the following reasons, we agree with the government that the district court could consider \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A), and thus affirm the district court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-11\">In 2002, Davis pleaded guilty to possession with intent to distribute cocaine base in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841 (Count 1), and possession of a firearm by an unlawful user of controlled substances in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(3) (Count 3). The district court imposed an aggregate sentence of 110 months\u2019 imprisonment, which was later reduced to 97 months pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). The district court also imposed a four-year term of supervised release as to Count 1, and a concurrent three-year term of supervised release as to Count 3. Davis began serving his terms of supervised release on December 22, 2008.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-12\">The district court subsequently revoked supervised release after finding that Davis had knowingly possessed, with intent to deliver, cocaine, and failed to report to the probation office in August 2010. Davis was sentenced to 36 months\u2019 imprisonment on Count 1, and 24 months\u2019 imprisonment on Count 3, to be served consecutively. In imposing sentence, the district court stated that it was sentencing Davis \u201cfor the purposes of punishment and deterrence, as well as meeting the other factors as set forth in [18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) ].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b574-13\">Because Davis only generally objected to the reasonableness of his sentence, we review his sentence for plain error only.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number><em>See United States v. Dunigan, </em>555 F.3d 501, 506 (5th Cir.2009). To show plain error, an appellant must show (1) a forfeited error (2) that is clear or obvious and (3) that affects his substantial rights. <em>Puckett v. United States, </em>556 U.S. 129, 135, 129 S.Ct. 1423, 173 L.Ed.2d 266 (2009). If an appellant makes such a showing, we have discretion to correct the error, but only if it seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings. <em>Id. </em>We need not decide whether to exercise our discretion because we find that Davis has failed to show plain error.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-5\">\u201cTo be \u2018plain,\u2019 legal error must be \u2018clear or obvious, rather than subject to reasonable dispute.\u2019\u201d <em>United States v. Castillo-Estevez, </em>597 F.3d 238, 241 (5th Cir.2010) (quoting <em>Puckett, </em>556 U.S. at 135, 129 S.Ct. 1423). Although our decision in <em>Miller </em>had not issued at the time the district court sentenced Davis, <em>Henderson </em>makes clear that we must consult <em>Miller </em>as the controlling statement of law at the time of appellate review. <em>See Henderson, </em>133 S.Ct. at 1124-25. In <em>Miller, </em>we held that a district court could not consider \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A) in revoking a supervised release term under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e), \u201cbecause Congress deliberately omitted that factor from the permissible factors enumerated in the statute.\u201d 634 F.3d at 844. Section 3583(e) provides that a court \u201cmay, after considering the factors set forth in section 3553(a)(1), (a)(2)(B), (a)(2)(C), (a)(2)(D), (a)(4), (a)(5), (a)(6), and (a)(7) ... revoke a term of supervised release.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e). Accordingly, a district court imposing sentence after revoking a supervised release term under \u00a7 3583(e) may not consider the sentence\u2019s need \u201cto reflect the seriousness of the offense, to promote respect for the law, and to provide just punishment for the offense.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b575-10\">Nevertheless, our holding in <em>Miller </em>does not extend beyond \u00a7 3583(e). 634 F.3d at 844. In particular, it does not reach sentences imposed under \u00a7 3583(g). Pursuant to that statute, \u201c[i]f the defendant ... possesses a controlled substance in violation of\u2019 his conditions of supervised release, \u201cthe court shall revoke the term of supervised release and require the defendant to serve a term of imprisonment.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(g). We have held that \u201cwhen revocation of supervised release is mandatory under ... \u00a7 3583(g), the statute does not <em>require </em>consideration of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors.\u201d <em>United States v. Giddings, </em>37 F.3d 1091, 1095 (5th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b575-11\">Here, the district court granted the government\u2019s motion to revoke supervised release under \u00a7 3583(e) and (g). First, the court revoked supervised release under \u00a7 3583(e) because Davis failed to report to probation. Second, because under the terms of his supervised release, Davis was prohibited from unlawfully possessing a controlled substance, his supervised release terms were mandatorily revoked under \u00a7 3583(g) upon the district court\u2019s finding that he had possessed cocaine. Although the district court could not consider \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A) in revoking supervised release and imposing sentence under \u00a7 3583(e) for Davis\u2019s failure to report, the court was not so constrained in revoking supervised release and imposing sentence under \u00a7 3583(g) for possession. <em>See id. </em>at 1095-97; <em>see also United States v. Olvera, </em>491 Fed.Appx. 488, 488-89 (5th Cir.2012) (per curiam) (unpublished) (consideration of \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A) was not clear or obvious error where revocation of supervised release was mandated by \u00a7 3583(g)); <em>United </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number><em>States v. Ibanez, </em>454 Fed.Appx. 328, 329-30 (5th Cir.2011) (per curiam) (unpublished).</p>\n<p id=\"b576-4\">Because the district court statutorily was required to revoke Davis\u2019s supervised release terms upon finding that he had been in possession of a controlled substance, <em>Miller </em>did not prohibit the court from considering \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A), including \u201cjust punishment.\u201d <em>See United States v. Wilson, </em>460 Fed.Appx. 351, 352 (5th Cir. 2012) (per curiam) (unpublished) (\u201cBecause \u00a7 3583(g) does not expressly invoke the \u00a7 3553(a) factors or the limits imposed by the first clause of \u00a7 3583(e), we find no clear or obvious error under <em>Miller.\u201d). </em>That Davis\u2019s supervised release terms were revoked not only for possession, but also because he failed to report to probation, does not alter our conclusion. <em>See United States v. Ellsworth, </em>490 Fed.Appx. 663, 663-64 (5th Cir.2012) (per curiam) (unpublished) (district court did not err in considering \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A) factor where supervised release was revoked under \u00a7 3583(e) and (g)).</p>\n<p id=\"b576-5\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED. The government\u2019s motion for summary disposition is DENIED as moot.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b574-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b574-14\">. Davis continues to argue that, by challenging the reasonableness of his sentence, his appeal should be reviewed under a \u201cplainly unreasonable\u201d standard. However, Davis did not object on the ground that the district court had considered a prohibited factor in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>imposing sentence. Plain-error review thus is appropriate. <em>See United States v. Whitelaw, </em>580 F.3d 256, 259-60 (5th Cir.2009).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
