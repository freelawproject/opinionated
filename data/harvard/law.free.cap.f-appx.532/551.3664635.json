Because she failed to disclose her potential claim against Merck in a prior bankruptcy petition, the district court found that the doctrine of judicial estoppel applied and granted Merck\u2019s summary judgment motion. The district court also denied Stru-jan\u2019s motion for leave to proceed in forma pauperis (IFP) on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1128-19\">Strujan now moves in this court for leave to proceed IFP on appeal. An IFP movant must demonstrate that she is a pauper and that she will raise nonfrivolous issues on appeal. <em>Carson v. Polley, </em>689 F.2d 562, 586 (5th Cir.1982). Strujan has not demonstrated that she has a nonfrivo-lous argument for appeal regarding the district court\u2019s judicial estoppel finding and grant of summary judgment. <em>See Love v. Tyson Foods, Inc., </em>677 F.3d 258, 261-62 (5th Cir.2012); <em>Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 220 (5th Cir.1983). Accordingly, her motion for leave to proceed IFP is DENIED, and the appeal is DISMISSED as frivolous. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b1128-15\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
