We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b755-21\">The district court did not err in denying Morales\u2019s motion to suppress. Officer Kroeger\u2019s decision to stop Morales was based on his observations that her truck was traveling below the average speed of traffic and that her windshield was cracked. These observations were sufficient to form a reasonable basis to suspect that Morales was violating Arizona Revised Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 28-72RB) and 28-957.01. <em>See United States v. Lopez-Soto, </em>205 F.3d 1101, 1104 (9th Cir.2000). Therefore, the investigatory stop of her vehicle was constitutional and suppression was not required.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-22\">The district court did not clearly err in denying Morales a downward adjustment for acceptance of responsibility under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1. The court correctly acknowledged that Morales was still eligible for the adjustment despite having gone to trial, <em>see United States v. Ramos-Medina, </em>706 F.3d 932, 941-42 (9th Cir.2013), but nonetheless concluded that she had not met her burden of demonstrating acceptance of responsibility based on her pretrial statements and conduct. This conclusion was supported by the record, which does not provide any indication that she accepted responsibility until she appeared at sentencing. <em>See United States v. Mar</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"730\">*730</page-number><em>tinez-Martinez, </em>369 F.3d 1076, 1090 (9th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b756-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b755-17\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9 th Cir.
