By moving to proceed IFP, Garrett is challenging the district court\u2019s certification that the appeal is not taken in good faith. <em>See Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997); Fed. R.App. P. 24(a)(5).</p>\n<p id=\"b603-24\">Garrett argues that the district court erred when it did not reduce his sentence pursuant to retroactive provisions of Amendment 750 to the United States Sentencing Guidelines. The district court, after considering Garrett\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion and the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors, determined that a sentence reduction was not appropriate in Garrett\u2019s case because, given Garrett\u2019s prior felony drug conviction, he qualified for a 240-month mandatory minimum sentence, and he was sentenced to a lesser sentence of 224 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-25\">The district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Garrett\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion. See \u00a7 3582(c)(2); <em>United States v. Henderson, </em>636 F.3d 713, 717 (5th Cir. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>2011); <em>United States v. Whitebird, </em>55 F.3d 1007, 1010 (5th Cir.1995). Consequently, we may dismiss this frivolous appeal sua sponte. <em>See Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 220 (5th Cir.1983); 5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-4\">Garrett\u2019s IFP motion is DENIED, and the appeal is DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b603-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
