The pre-sentence report (\u201cPSR\u201d) concluded that Mendez was responsible for 551.6 grams of cocaine base, 52 kilograms of cocaine, and 5,000 pounds of marijuana, which totaled a marijuana equivalency of 23,700 kilograms. <em>See U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>(\u201cUSSG\u201d) (2009). The PSR also assigned a three-level increase based on Mendez\u2019s leadership role in the offense, USSG \u00a7 3Bl.l(b), and a three-level downward adjustment based on acceptance of responsibility, USSG \u00a7 3El.l(b), for a total offense level of 36. With a criminal history category of I, Mendez\u2019s recommended advisory Guidelines range was 188 to 235 months\u2019 imprisonment. The court originally sentenced Mendez to 210 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-10\">On appeal, we found that the district court plainly erred in failing to consider the factors listed in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) (2006) or to state on the record a basis for the sentence it imposed. Accordingly, Mendez\u2019s sentence was vacated and his case remanded for resentencing to allow the district court to conduct a proper \u00a7 3553(a) analysis and to provide a basis for the chosen sentence. <em>See United States v. Mendez, </em>No. 11-4095 (4th Cir. July 5, 2012) (unpublished). However, we upheld the district court\u2019s calculation of drug quantity for which Mendez was held accountable and also the enhancement he received for his role in the offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-12\">On remand, the district court held another sentencing hearing in order to address the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, as directed by this court. After properly noting that it was foreclosed from revisiting Mendez\u2019s challenges to drug quantity calculations and his leadership enhancement, <em>see United States v. Bell, </em>5 F.3d 64, 66 (4th Cir. 1993) (prohibiting relitigation of issues expressly or impliedly decided by the appellate court), the district court went on to discuss Mendez\u2019s background and history, reviewed the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, and imposed a 188-month sentence. Mendez noted a timely appeal, again arguing that his sentence is procedurally and substantively unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-13\">This court reviews the district court\u2019s sentence, \u201cwhether inside, just outside, or significantly outside the Guidelines range,\u201d under a \u201cdeferential abuse-of-discretion standard.\u201d <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 41, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). This standard of review involves two steps; under the first, this court examines the sentence for significant procedural errors, and under the second, we review the substance of the sentence. <em>United States v. Pauley, </em>511 F.3d 468, 473 (4th Cir.2007) (examining <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 50-51, 128 S.Ct. 586). Significant procedural errors include \u201cfailing to calculate (or improperly calculating) the Guidelines range, treating the Guidelines as mandatory, failing to consider the [ 18 U.S.C.] \u00a7 3553(a) factors, selecting a sentence based on clearly erroneous facts, or failing to adequately explain the chosen sentence \u2014 including an explanation for any deviation from the Guidelines range.\u201d <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 51, 128 S.Ct. 586. A sentencing court \u201cmust state in open court the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>particular reasons supporting its chosen sentence.\u201d <em>United States v. Carter, </em>564 F.3d 325, 328 (internal quotation marks omitted) (4th Cir.2009); <em>see also United States v. Lynn, </em>592 F.3d 572, 576 (4th Cir.2010). In so doing, the sentencing judge \u201cmust place on the record an 'individualized assessment\u2019 based on the particular facts of the case before it[,]\u201d which \u201cset[s] forth enough to satisfy the appellate court that he has considered the parties\u2019 arguments and has a reasoned basis for exercising his own legal decisionmaking authority....\u201d <em>Carter, </em>564 F.3d at 328, 330. However, the sentencing court need not \u201crobotically tick through \u00a7 3553(a)\u2019s every subsection.\u201d <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>445 F.3d 339, 345 (4th Cir.2006). If there are no significant procedural errors, this court then considers the substantive reasonableness of the sentence, \u201ctak[ing] into account the totality of the circumstances.\u201d <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 51, 128 S.Ct. 586.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-4\">Our review of the transcript of the sentencing hearing conducted on remand leads us to conclude that the district court carefully considered each of Mendez\u2019s arguments and properly addressed the \u00a7 3553(a) factors in choosing a sentence. The court specifically addressed Mendez\u2019s challenges to the drug quantity attributed to him. The court discussed its review of Mendez\u2019s personal and family information, his health history, education level, and employment history. The court then cited the factors under \u00a7 3553(a) that supported its decision to impose a 188-month sentence. We find that the district court made an individualized assessment and adequately explained the reasons why it rejected Mendez\u2019s arguments for a below-guidelines sentence as well as its reasons for the sentence it imposed. Moreover, Mendez cannot overcome the presumption of reasonableness accorded his within-Guidelines sentence. <em>See United States v. Mendoza-Mendoza, </em>597 F.3d 212, 217 (4th Cir.2010). Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-6\">We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before this court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-7\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
