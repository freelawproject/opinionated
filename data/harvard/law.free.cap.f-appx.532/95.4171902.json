For the purposes of this appeal, we look to his 2006 conviction (in the United States District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania) for possession with intent to distribute less than fifty kilograms of marijuana, which we affirmed in 2008. <em>See generally United States v. Skeffery, </em>283 Fed.Appx. 75 (3d Cir.2008). Skeffery has filed a belated petition for writ of coram nobis, arguing that this conviction and sentence are \u201cconstitutionally invalid due to\u201d Fed. R.Crim.P. 11(c), Fifth, Sixth, and Fourteenth Amendment violations. He alleges that he was not properly informed of the immigration consequences of his decision to plead guilty. The District Court denied relief, and Skeffery now seeks our review.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b122-12\">The District Court\u2019s decision was proper. As the District Court pointed out, Skeffery specifically waived his right to collaterally attack his plea,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and we see nothing in the record that would suggest either that the waiver was infirm or that enforcing it would work a miscarriage of justice. <em>See United States v. Mabry, </em>536 F.3d 231, 237-39 (3d Cir.2008). And there would be no injustice because the theory upon which Skeffery relies is no longer valid; as the Supreme Court recently held, <em>Padilla v. Kentucky, </em>559 U.S. 356, 130 S.Ct. 1473, 176 L.Ed.2d 284 (2010), announced a \u201cnew rule,\u201d and \u201cdefendants whose convictions became final prior to <em>Padilla </em>therefore cannot benefit from its holding.\u201d <em>Chaidez v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 133 S.Ct. 1103, 1113, 185 L.Ed.2d 149 (2013). Thus, regardless of whether he was fully apprised by counsel of the immigration consequences of his plea, Skeffery has no colorable claim of ineffective assistance of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-15\">Because no substantial question is presented by this appeal, we will summarily affirm the judgment of the District Court. <em>See Murray v. Bledsoe, </em>650 F.3d 246, 248 (3d Cir.2011) (per curiam); <em>see also </em>3d Cir. L.A.R. 27.4; 3d Cir. I.O.P. 10.6.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b122-10\">. \"In federal courts the authority to grant a writ of <em>coram nobis </em>is conferred by the All Writs Act, which permits 'courts established by Act of Congress' to issue 'all writs necessary or appropriate in aid of their respective jurisdictions.' \u201d <em>United States v. Denedo, </em>556 U.S. 904, 911, 129 S.Ct. 2213, 173 L.Ed.2d 1235 (2009) (quoting 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1651(a)). \"The District Court had jurisdiction over the petition under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1651(a), in aid of its jurisdiction pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3231. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review the District Court\u2019s legal conclusions de novo and its factual findings for clear error.\u201d <em>Mendoza v. United States, </em>690 F.3d 157, 159 (3d Cir.2012) (citation omitted).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b122-18\">. In its decision, the District Court emphasized that coram nobis is a rare remedy only available in limited situations, and is not coterminous with relief available under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. We agree that obtaining co-ram nobis relief is a more-daunting task than succeeding under \u00a7 2255. <em>See, e.g., Mendoza, </em>690 F.3d at 159. However, in light of Skeffery's waiver and the invalidity of his claim, we do not reach the issue of the scope of coram nobis.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
