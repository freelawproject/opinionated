California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), asserting that there are no meritorious grounds for appeal but questioning whether the sentence imposed by the district court on remand was reasonable. McBride was advised of his right to file a pro se supplemental brief but did not file one. Finding no error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-21\">The sole issue raised in the <em>Anders </em>brief is whether McBride\u2019s sentence on remand was reasonable. In reviewing a sentence, we must first ensure that the district court did not commit any \u201csignificant procedural error,\u201d such as failing to properly calculate the applicable Guidelines range, failing to consider the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) (2006) factors, or failing to adequately explain the sentence. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). Once we have determined that there is no procedural error, we must consider the substantive reasonableness of the sentence, \u201ctakfing] into account the totality of the circumstances.\u201d <em>Id. </em>If the sentence imposed is within the appropriate Guidelines range, we consider it presumptively reasonable. <em>United States v. Abu Ali, </em>528 F.3d 210, 261 (4th Cir.2008). The presumption may be rebutted by a showing \u201cthat the sentence is unreasonable when measured against the \u00a7 3553(a) factors.\u201d <em>United States v. Montes-Pineda, </em>445 F.3d 375, 379 (4th Cir.2006) (internal quotation marks omitted). Upon review, we conclude that the district court committed no procedural or substantive error in impos<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>ing the 188-month sentence on remand. <em>United States v. Lynn, </em>592 F.3d 572, 577 (4th Cir.2010) (providing standard of review).</p>\n<p id=\"b447-5\">In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the record in this case and have found no meritorious issues for appeal. We therefore affirm the district court\u2019s amended judgment. This court requires that counsel inform McBride, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If McBride requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on McBride. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal conclusions are adequately presented in the materials before this court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-6\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b446-19\"> We previously affirmed McBride\u2019s conviction for possession of a firearm or ammunition by a convicted felon but vacated his sentence on that conviction: we also vacated his convictions for the instant \u00a7 841(a)(1) charge and a charge of possession of a firearm in furtherance of a drug trafficking crime and remanded for additional proceedings. <em>See United States v. McBride, </em>676 F.3d 385 (4th Cir. 2012). The \"possession in furtherance\u201d charge was dismissed on remand pursuant to a plea agreement between McBride and the Government.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
