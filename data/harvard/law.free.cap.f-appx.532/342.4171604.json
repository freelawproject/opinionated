Hein-Muniz, M.D. (\u201cMuniz\u201d),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> a physician whose clinical privileges at Aiken Regional Medical Center (\u201cARMC\u201d) were terminated after a peer review proceeding, appeals the district court\u2019s entry of summary judgment on the civil action she subsequently brought against the Appellees, in which she attacked the peer review process and the ultimate decision by ARMC\u2019s Board of Governors (\u201cBoard\u201d) to terminate her privileges. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-15\">We forgo a full recounting of the facts, which are well known to the parties. The bulk of the parties\u2019 arguments on appeal concern the applicability of the Health Care Quality Improvement Act (\u201cHCQIA\u201d), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 11101-11152 (2006), which immunizes those who participate in a \u201cprofessional review action\u201d from monetary damages as long as the action is taken</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b369-16\">(1) in the reasonable belief that the action was in the furtherance of quality health care,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b369-17\">(2) after a reasonable effort to obtain the facts of the matter,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b369-18\">(8) after adequate notice and hearing procedures are afforded to the physician involved or after such other procedures as are fair to the physician under the circumstances, and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b369-19\">(4) in the reasonable belief that the action was warranted by the facts known after such reasonable effort to obtain facts and after meeting the requirement of paragraph (3).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b369-20\">42 U.S.C. \u00a7 11112(a) (2006); <em>Wahi v. Charleston Area Med. Ctr., Inc., </em>562 F.3d 599, 606-07 (4th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b369-21\">\u201cA professional review action shall be presumed to have met the preceding standards necessary for [immunity] unless the presumption is rebutted by a preponderance of the evidence.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 11112(a). In view of this presumption, whether the participants in the peer review action are entitled to summary judgment necessitates application of an \u201cunconventional\u201d standard: \u201cwhether a reasonable jury, viewing all facts in a light most favorable to [the plaintiff], could conclude that [she] had shown, by a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>preponderance of the evidence, that [the peer review participants\u2019] actions fell outside the scope of section 11112(a).\u201d <em>Gabaldoni v. Wash. Cnty. Hosp. Ass\u2019n, </em>250 F.3d 255, 260 (4th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b370-4\">Having reviewed the record, we are persuaded that no reasonable jury could have concluded that the Appellees failed to meet any of the four requirements of the HCQIA. First, no reasonable jury could have concluded that Muniz carried her burden of showing that the Board was not motivated by a reasonable belief that its termination of Muniz\u2019s privileges was in the furtherance of quality health care \u2014 a goal that certainly includes ensuring that physicians affiliated with ARMC are candid and truthful in their interactions with colleagues and patients. <em>See, e.g., </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 11151(9) (2006); <em>Singh v. Blue Cross/Blue Shield of Mass., Inc., </em>308 F.3d 25, 39 (1st Cir.2002). Because \u00a7 11112(a)(1) requires only a \u201creasonable belief\u2019 that the action was in furtherance of quality health care, the test is \u201can objective one which looks to the totality of the circumstances.\u201d <em>Imperial v. Suburban Hosp. Ass\u2019n, Inc., </em>37 F.3d 1026, 1030 (4th Cir.1994); <em>see also Gabaldoni, </em>250 F.3d at 261.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-6\">Due to the objective nature of this court\u2019s inquiry, \u201cto the extent [Muniz\u2019s] case relies on inferences of a conspiracy to oust [her], ... such inferences do not create any genuine issues of fact.... In the HCQIA immunity context, the circuits that have considered the issue all agree that the subjective bias or bad faith motives of the peer reviewers is irrelevant.\u201d <em>Sugarbaker v. SSM Health Care, </em>190 F.3d 905, 914 (8th Cir.1999); <em>see Cohlmia v. St. John Med. Ctr., </em>693 F.3d 1269, 1279 (10th Cir. 2012). And \u201c[t]he fact that some of the specific concerns [identified by the hearing panel and the Medical Executive Committee] shifted or changed over time does not rebut the presumption that the hospital acted in the reasonable belief that it was furthering quality health care.\u201d <em>Lee v. Trinity Lutheran Hosp., </em>408 F.3d 1064, 1071 (8th Cir.2005) (internal quotation marks omitted). Notwithstanding Muniz\u2019s attempt to portray the Medical Executive Committee\u2019s conduct as a conspiratorial ploy to eject her from ARMC, we can only conclude on the record that there was \u201cenough evidence against [Muniz] for the Board to believe that it was furthering the quality of health care in terminating [her] privileges.\u201d <em>Gabaldoni, </em>250 F.3d at 261 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b370-8\">Given the extensive peer review process conducted in Muniz\u2019s case, we likewise conclude that no reasonable jury could find that the Board had failed on the HCQIA\u2019s second prong \u2014 to make a reasonable effort to obtain the pertinent facts. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 11112(a)(2); <em>Moore v. Williamsburg Reg\u2019l Hosp., </em>560 F.3d 166, 175-76 (4th Cir.2009); <em>Singh, </em>308 F.3d at 43; <em>Gabaldoni, </em>250 F.3d at 261.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-9\">Muniz\u2019s argument as to the third prong of \u00a7 11112(a) must meet the same fate. Even assuming that the safe harbor provisions found in 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 11112(b) (2006) apply only partially to the Board\u2019s peer review action, <em>but see, e.g., Moore, </em>560 F.3d at 176, we nonetheless think it inescapable that the Board terminated Muniz\u2019s privileges \u201cafter such other procedures as are fair to the physician under the circumstances.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 11112(a)(3). We do not believe that a reasonable jury could find that the procedural irregularities involving the hearing officer \u2014 unwise though some of them were \u2014 rendered Muniz\u2019s peer review process unfair or objectively unreasonable. <em>See Wahi, </em>562 F.3d at 610, 614 (noting standard). Nor do we countenance Muniz\u2019s assertion that she was insufficiently on notice that she was required to tell the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>truth during her peer review process and that her privileges could be terminated if she did not do so. A reasonable jury could only conclude that it was \u201cfair\u201d for the Board to terminate Muniz after giving her extensive opportunity in a lengthy hearing to explain her misrepresentations. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 11112(a)(3). <em>See also Moore, </em>560 F.3d at 175 (\u201c[T]he entire purpose of an immunity provision is to afford some discretionary latitude to decisionmakers to make close calls unhaunted by the specter of civil liability.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b371-5\">Finally, Muniz\u2019s arguments as to the HCQIA\u2019s fourth prong cannot forestall summary judgment, either, given that a reasonable jury could conclude only that the Board\u2019s conduct was taken \u201cin the reasonable belief that the action was warranted by the facts known\u201d to it. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 11112(a)(4). Because Muniz has failed to show that the facts relied upon by the Board were \u201cso obviously mistaken or inadequate as to make reliance on them unreasonable,\u201d she cannot defeat the presumption that the Board\u2019s action complied with \u00a7 11112(a)(4). <em>Meyers v. Columbia/HCA Healthcare Corp., </em>341 F.3d 461, 471 (6th Cir.2003) (internal quotation marks omitted). <em>See also Moore, </em>560 F.3d at 172 (\u201cHCQIA immunity allows hospitals to take prophylactic measures that need not involve proof of improper conduct beyond a reasonable doubt so long as statutory procedures designed to protect the reputation and livelihood of the physician have been observed.\u201d). Nor does the HCQIA require the Board to consider less severe disciplinary options as long as the one chosen is reasonably warranted by the facts. <em>Id. </em>at 176; <em>Singh, </em>308 F.3d at 38.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-7\">Because Muniz \u201chas not met [her] burden of showing that the requirements in \u00a7 11112(a)(l)-(4) were not met\u201d by the Board, the district court properly determined that the Appellees are immune from damages under the HCQIA. <em>Moore, </em>560 F.3d at 176.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> To the extent that any of Muniz\u2019s substantive state law claims survive the operation of the HCQIA, we also conclude that the district court properly entered summary judgment on each of them. <em>See id. </em>at 176-78.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-8\">Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the district court. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the material before this court and argument will not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-9\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b369-13\">.
