Beneficial Indus. Loan Corp., </em>337 U.S. 541, 546, 69 S.Ct. 1221, 93 L.Ed. 1528 (1949). When a notice of appeal is premature, the jurisdictional defect can be cured if the district court enters a final judgment prior to our consideration of the appeal under the doctrine of cumulative finality. <em>Equip. Fin. Group, Inc. v. Traverse Computer Brokers, </em>973 F.2d 345, 347-48 (4th Cir.1992). However, not all premature notices of appeal are subject to the cumulative finality rule; instead, this doctrine applies only if the appellant appeals from an order that the district court could have certified for immediate appeal under Fed.R.Civ.P. 54(b). <em>In re Bryson, </em>406 F.3d 284, 287-89 (4th Cir.2005). Appeals from \u201cclearly interlocutory decision[s]\u201d like \u201cdiscovery ruling[s] or ... sanction[s]\u201d cannot be saved under cumulative finality. <em>Id. </em>at 288. Here, because Mwabira-Simera appeals the district court\u2019s order denying his discovery requests and for appointment of counsel, the cumulative finality rule cannot apply and Mwabira-Simera\u2019s appeal is therefore interlocutory. Accordingly, we grant SuperValu\u2019s motion to dismiss No. 13-1097 as interlocutory.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-22\">Upon our review of the record, we find no reversible error in the district court\u2019s dismissal of the action, or in any of the preliminary rulings Mwabira-Simera seeks to challenge. Accordingly, we affirm No. 13-1274 for the reasons stated by the district court. <em>Mwabira-Simera v. Edmondson, </em>No. l:12-cv-00652-CCB (D. Md. Jan 2, 2013; Feb. 19, 2013; Feb. 27, 2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b394-23\">We grant leave to proceed in forma pauperis. We deny SuperValu\u2019s motion to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>strike and for sanctions. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before this court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-5\">No. 13-1097 <em>DISMISSED.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b395-6\">No. 13-1274 <em>AFFIRMED.</em></p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b394-19\"> Officer Edmondson was dismissed as a party in state court; he was never served, and has not filed a brief or otherwise participated in this case on the federal level.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
