Fed. R.App. P. 34(a)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b808-10\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b808-11\">Defendant Jesus Pargas-Gonzales appeals the district court\u2019s entry of criminal judgment. Reviewing de novo \u201cthe district court\u2019s denial of a motion to dismiss an indictment under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326 when the motion is based on an alleged deprivation of due process in the underlying removal proceedings,\u201d <em>United States v. Villavicencio-Burruel, </em>608 F.3d 556, 559 (9th Cir.2010), we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-12\">The district court correctly held that the entry of the 2006 removal order was not \u201cfundamentally unfair.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(d)(3). We need not decide whether Defendant\u2019s conviction under California Penal Code section 12021(a)(1) (2005) categorically qualifies as an \u201caggravated felony\u201d pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii), because it qualifies under the modified categorical approach.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-16\">We may consider the police reports, because Defendant stipulated to them in state court as a factual basis for his plea of no contest. <em>United States v. Almazan-Becerra, </em>537 F.3d 1094, 1097-99 (9th Cir.2008). The 23 pages of police reports almost all pertain to Defendant\u2019s <em>possession </em>of the handgun in question and to his use of it, specifically, his accidental discharge of the handgun, wounding the leg of a bystander. The single, brief contextual reference in the police reports to Defendant\u2019s ownership of the handgun related only to his own narrative explaining how he came to <em>possess </em>and use it. Defendant\u2019s state-court conviction was for possession, not ownership. <em>See id. </em>at 1099 n. 2 (rejecting, in similar circumstances, the argument that, because the police reports contained some references to a different crime, the record is ambiguous: \u201cWe reject this contention because the [police] reports, when read as a whole, describe only one type of offense \u2014 selling marijuana.\u201d); <em>cf. United States v. Casterline, </em>103 F.3d 76, 78-79 (9th Cir.1996) (reversing a conviction under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1) where the defendant held title to firearms but was in prison at the time of the crime charged; at that time, \u201cthe sheriffs office had exclusive physical possession and control\u201d of the firearms).</p>\n<p id=\"b808-17\">Our recent decision in <em>Aguilar-Turcios v. Holder, </em>691 F.3d 1025 (9th Cir.2012), is not to the contrary, because the record in that case contained no factual admissions pertinent to the charged crime that met the federal definition. Here, by contrast, the factual admissions in the police reports pertain almost entirely to possession, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"783\">*783</page-number>which Defendant concedes constitutes an aggravated felony.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b808-18\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
