Ellington appeals pro se from the District Court\u2019s August 11, 2011 order granting Appellees Nicholas Cortes, Gerald Powell, Wakowski,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and the Pennsylvania State Police\u2019s (the \u201cState Police Defendants\u201d) motion to dismiss, and the District Court\u2019s February 1, 2013 order granting Appellees William Spencer and Donna Asure\u2019s (the \u201cSCI-Forest Defendants\u201d) motion for summary judgment. Because the appeal presents no substantial question, we will summarily affirm the District Court\u2019s orders.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-14\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-15\">In December 2009, Appellant Thomas B. Ellington, a prisoner at SCI-Forest in Marienville, Pennsylvania, filed a pro se civil rights complaint in the U.S. District Court against the State Police Defendants for conducting an allegedly unlawful search of Ellington\u2019s person, and for battery under Pennsylvania law.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Regarding the SCI-Forest Defendants, Ellington asserted that, while incarcerated, Spencer, a correctional officer at SCI-Forest, used excessive force against him, and that Asure, the warden of SCI-Forest, failed to supervise Spencer.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b80-16\">In May 2010, the State Police Defendants filed their motion to dismiss, and in February 2011, the Magistrate Judge issued his report and recommendation, finding that Ellington\u2019s suit against the Pennsylvania State Police was barred by the Eleventh Amendment. The Magistrate Judge further noted that the suit against Cortes, Powell, and Wakowski (in their unofficial capacity) was barred by the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine, as a ruling that the search was unreasonable would require the District Court to find that the Pennsylvania state court\u2019s decision on Ellington\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>motion to suppress was incorrect.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The Magistrate Judge further noted that Ellington failed to state a claim for battery-under Pennsylvania law due to his failure to allege that Cortes, Powell, and Wakowski intended to harm him. In August 2011, the District Court adopted the Magistrate Judge\u2019s report, granted the motion to dismiss, and dismissed the State Police Defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-5\">In March 2012, the SCI-Forest Defendants filed their motion for summary judgment, and in October 2012, the Magistrate Judge issued his report and recommendation. The Magistrate Judge noted that during the plea colloquy at which Ellington pleaded guilty to assault, he stated that he lunged towards Spencer in an attempt to cause him bodily injury. The Magistrate Judge further noted that one of the correctional officers testified that five correctional officers were needed to restrain Ellington. Accordingly, the Magistrate Judge found that Ellington had faded to establish that Spencer used excessive force to restrain him. The Magistrate Judge also found that, as no jury could conclude that Spencer had violated Ellington\u2019s Eighth Amendment rights, no jury could find that Spencer\u2019s injuries resulted from a policy or practice instituted by Asure. In February 2013, the District Court adopted the Magistrate Judge\u2019s report and granted the motion for summary judgment. Ellington timely appealed both of the District Court\u2019s orders.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-7\">We have appellate jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. Our review of a District Court\u2019s orders granting a motion to dismiss and a motion for summary judgment is plenary. <em>Spruill v. Gillis, 372 </em>F.3d 218, 226 (3d Cir.2004); <em>DeHart v. Horn, </em>390 F.3d 262, 267 (3d Cir.2004). In reviewing the District Court\u2019s decision to grant the State Police Defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss, we accept as true all allegations in the complaint, giving the plaintiff the benefit of every favorable inference that can be drawn from the allegations. <em>See Erickson v. Pardus, </em>551 U.S. 89, 93-94, 127 S.Ct. 2197, 167 L.Ed.2d 1081 (2007). Ellington, as a pro se litigant, is entitled to a more liberal reading of his complaint, though it must still \u201ccontain sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to \u2018state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.\u2019\u201d <em>See Higgs v. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>655 F.3d 333, 339 (3d Cir.2011); <em>Ashcroft v. Iqbal, </em>556 U.S. 662, 678, 129 S.Ct. 1937, 173 L.Ed.2d 868 (2009) (quoting <em>Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, </em>550 U.S. 544, 570, 127 S.Ct. 1955, 167 L.Ed.2d 929 (2007)). In reviewing whether the District Court\u2019s decision to grant the SCI-Forest Defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment was proper, this Court must determine whether, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to Ellington and drawing all inferences in his favor, there was no genuine issue of material fact and the SCI-Forest Defendants were entitled to judgment as a matter of law. See Fed. R.Civ.P. 56(a); <em>Reedy v. Evanson, </em>615 F.3d 197, 210 (3d Cir.2010). We may summarily affirm a judgment of the District Court on any basis supported by the record if the appeal does not raise a substantial question. See I.O.P. 10.6; <em>see also Murray v. Bledsoe, </em>650 F.3d 246, 247 (3d Cir.2011) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b82-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>III.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-4\">Regarding the District Court\u2019s order granting the motion to dismiss filed by the State Court Defendants, this Court agrees that, with regard to the Pennsylvania State Police, and Cortes, Powell, and Wakowski (acting in their official capacity), the Eleventh Amendment requires the dismissal of Ellington\u2019s claims. The Eleventh Amendment protects a state or state agency from a \u00a7 1983 suit, unless Congress has specifically abrogated the state\u2019s immunity or the state has waived its own immunity. <em>See MCI Telecomm. Corp. v. Bell Atl.-Pa., </em>271 F.3d 491, 503-04 (3d Cir.2001). Section 1983 does not abrogate Pennsylvania\u2019s immunity, and Pennsylvania has specifically withheld consent to being sued. <em>See Quern v. Jordan, </em>440 U.S. 332, 340-41, 99 S.Ct. 1139, 59 L.Ed.2d 358 (1979); <em>Laskaris v. Thornburgh, </em>661 F.2d 23, 25 (3d Cir.1981). Additionally, an element of any claim brought pursuant to \u00a7 1983 is that the alleged wrongdoing be committed by a \u201cperson.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. For purposes of \u00a7 1983, Cortes, Powell, and Wakowski are not \u201cpersons\u201d when acting in their official capacity. <em>Will v. Mich. Dep\u2019t of State Police, </em>491 U.S. 58, 71, 109 S.Ct. 2304, 105 L.Ed.2d 45 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b82-5\">Regarding Cortes, Powell, and Wakowski in their unofficial capacity, the District Court held that it lacked jurisdiction over this case because of the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-6\">That doctrine, which takes its name from two Supreme Court cases, generally withholds jurisdiction of federal courts (save the United States Supreme Court) over state judgments, as they are more appropriately appealed within the state judiciary. <em>See D.C. Court of Appeals v. Feldman, </em>460 U.S. 462, 103 S.Ct. 1303, 75 L.Ed.2d 206 (1983); <em>Rooker v. Fid. Trust Co., </em>263 U.S. 413, 44 S.Ct. 149, 68 L.Ed. 362 (1923). It is narrow in scope. The Supreme Court has explained that it \u201cis confined to cases of the kind from which the doctrine acquired its name: cases brought by state-court losers complaining of injuries caused by state-court judgments rendered before the district court proceedings commenced and inviting district court review and rejection of those judgments.\u201d <em>Exxon Mobil Corp. v. Saudi Basic Indus. Corp., </em>544 U.S. 280, 284, 125 S.Ct. 1517, 161 L.Ed.2d 454 (2005). We have distilled <em>Exxon\u2019s </em>holding into the following four-part test, each part of which must be satisfied: \u201c(1) the federal plaintiff lost in state court; (2) the plaintiff complains of injuries caused by the state-court judgments; (3) those judgments were rendered before the federal suit was filed; and (4) the plaintiff is inviting the district court to review and reject the state judgments.\u201d <em>Great W. Mining &amp; Mineral Co. v. Fox Rothschild LLP, </em>615 F.3d 159, 166 (3d Cir.2010) (quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b82-8\">The instant case does not meet those criteria. Specifically, Ellington\u2019s asserted injuries were not \u201ccaused by the state-court judgment.\u201d Rather, Ellington\u2019s alleged injuries consist of his \u00a7 1983 claims against Cortes, Powell, and Wakowski. Those claims existed before any state court case; the state-court judgment in no sense \u201ccaused\u201d those alleged injuries. <em>See id. </em>at 166-68. Accordingly, we conclude that the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine does not preclude jurisdiction in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-9\">However, based upon the record, it is clear that a finding in Ellington\u2019s favor would imply the invalidity of his conviction on the two drug related charges, which were based upon the contraband found by Cortes during what Ellington describes as an unreasonable and unconstitutional search. Accordingly, unless and until Ellington successfully invalidates either the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>Monroe County Court of Common Pleas\u2019 decision on his motion to suppress, or the underlying conviction, a dismissal of Ellington\u2019s claims, without prejudice, is appropriate. <em>See Heck v. Humphrey, </em>512 U.S. 477, 486-87, 114 S.Ct. 2364, 129 L.Ed.2d 383 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b83-5\">Regarding Ellington\u2019s state law claim for battery, the District Court incorrectly relied upon the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine to dismiss Ellington\u2019s claims against Cortes, Powell, and Wakowski. As noted above, <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>does not apply, as Ellington is not challenging a \u201cstate-court judgment,\u201d but rather the alleged battery committed by Cortes. However, <em>Heck </em>may also bar the District Court from calling into question the Monroe County Court of Common Pleas\u2019 decision that Ellington consented to the search of his person (which could call into question the reasonableness of search itself), which would negate any claim of battery. <em>See Heck, </em>512 U.S. at 486-87, 114 S.Ct. 2364; <em>Levenson v. Souser, </em>384 Pa.Super. 132, 557 A.2d 1081, 1088 (Ct.1989). Additionally, even if <em>Heck </em>is inapplicable, Ellington\u2019s claim of battery is without merit, as the Monroe County Court of Common Pleas determination that he consented to the search is entitled to resjudicata effect. <em>See Marrese v. Am. Acad. of Orthopaedic Surgeons, </em>470 U.S. 373, 380-81, 105 S.Ct. 1327, 84 L.Ed.2d 274 (1985); <em>Shuder v. McDonald\u2019s Corp., </em>859 F.2d 266, 273 (3d Cir.1988). Accordingly, the District Court\u2019s order granting the Pennsylvania State Police Defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss was proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-6\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-7\">The District Court properly granted the SCI-Forest Defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment. When considering an excessive use of force claim, a district court must consider whether force was applied in a \u201cgood-faith effort to maintain or restore discipline, or maliciously and sadistically\u201d to cause harm. <em>Hudson v. McMillian, </em>503 U.S. 1, 6-7, 112 S.Ct. 995, 117 L.Ed.2d 156 (1992). Courts look to several factors when making this determination, including (1) the need for the application of force; (2) the relationship between the need and the amount of force that was used; (3) the extent of the injury inflicted; (4) the extent of the threat to the safety of staff and inmates, as reasonably perceived by prison officials; and (5) any efforts made to temper the severity of a forceful response. <em>See Whitley v. Albers, </em>475 U.S. 312, 321, 106 S.Ct. 1078, 89 L.Ed.2d 251 (1986); <em>Brooks v. Kyler, </em>204 F.3d 102, 106 (3d Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b83-9\">In determining that excessive force was not used on Ellington, the District Court properly relied upon Ellington\u2019s guilty plea for assault and his colloguy where he stated that he \u201clunged towards [Spencer] in an attempt to cause him bodily injury.\u201d In addition, while Ellington\u2019s aggression does not establish, on its own, that Spencer did not use excessive force, the record shows that it took approximately five correctional officers to restrain Ellington following his altercation with Spencer, and that Ellington\u2019s injuries included only two lumps on his forehead and multiple superficial scratches. As noted by the District Court, the evidence, when interpreted in the light most favorable to Ellington, does not establish a genuine issue of material fact as to whether Spencer\u2019s use of force was reasonable following Ellington\u2019s assault. Regarding Asure, as no Eighth Amendment violation occurred, Asure cannot be found liable based on an alleged failure to train or supervise. <em>See Beers-Capitol v. Whetzel, </em>256 F.3d 120, 134 (3d Cir.2001). Accordingly, the District Court\u2019s granting of the SCI-Forest Defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment was proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>V.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-4\">For these reasons, the District Court properly granted the motion to dismiss and the motion for summary judgment. Because this appeal presents us with no substantial question, we will summarily affirm the District Court\u2019s orders. <em>See </em>3rd Cir. LAR 27.4 and I.O.P. 10.6.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b80-10\">. Defendant Wakowski\u2019s first name is not provided in the record.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b80-11\">. Specifically, Ellington alleged that in June 2009, Cortes pulled over Ellington and, after Powell and Wakowski arrived, they conducted a search of Ellington\u2019s vehicle and found nothing. Ellington further alleged that Cortes then patted him down and put his hands between his legs claiming to have felt an object, and then used a pair of pliers to remove an object (later determined to be 100 grams of cocaine) from Ellington\u2019s anal region. As a result of the contraband, Ellington was charged, and ultimately convicted of, one count of Intentional Possession of a Controlled Substance by Unregistered Person and one count of Manufacture/Delivery/Possession of Controlled Substance with Intent to Manufacture or Deliver.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b80-18\">. Specifically, Ellington alleged that, in October 2009, while confined at the Monroe County Correctional Facility, Spencer entered Ellington\u2019s cell and started to harass him and poured milk over his face and body. Ellington alleged that he immediately stood up and that Spencer lunged forward and struck Ellington and continued to attack Ellington while he was helpless on the floor of his cell. Ellington alleged that Asure stood by and watched this incident.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b81-8\">. The Monroe County Court of Common Pleas determined, in addressing Ellington\u2019s motion to suppress, that the search of Ellington and the incidents surrounding the search were reasonable and did not violate Ellington's constitutional rights, in part due to Ellington\u2019s consent to the search. Had the Monroe County Court of Common Pleas held otherwise, the contraband would have been suppressed, and the two drug-related charges against Ellington would have been dismissed.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
