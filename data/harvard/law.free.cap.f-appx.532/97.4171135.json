Vora, proceeding pro se, appeals from the District Court\u2019s orders dismissing her complaint and denying her motions for reconsideration. For the reasons that follow, we will summarily affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-17\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-18\">In August 2012, Vora filed a motion to proceed in forma pauperis and a proposed \u201ccomplaint\u201d alleging that she was charged with, and being prosecuted for, criminal trespass as part of a larger scheme of racial discrimination perpetrated by the police and public officials in the City of Johnstown, Pennsylvania. (Dkt. No. 6.) On September 4, 2012, the District Court dismissed the complaint for lack of jurisdiction because it sought to \u201cattack a pending state criminal matter\u201d and for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii). (Dkt. No. 5, p. 3.) Her motions for release, an injunction, and to vacate were denied as moot. <em>(Id.) </em>Vora then filed, on September 12, 2012, a motion for preliminary injunction, followed by motions to extend time, supplement, and stay. (Dkt. Nos. 8, 10-12, 14.) The District Court construed all of those motions as requesting reconsideration and denied them on February 19, 2013. Vora filed a notice of appeal on March 18, 2013.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-20\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-21\">Vora appeals from the District Court\u2019s order dismissing her complaint and its order denying reconsideration. The District Court dismissed Vora\u2019s complaint on September 4, 2012. She then filed a motion for reconsideration within the requisite twenty-eight day time period, thereby tolling the time for filing an appeal. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 59(e); Fed. RApp. P. 4(a)(4)(A)(iv). The District Court denied reconsideration on February 19, 2013, and Vora timely appealed. Therefore, we have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 to review both orders of the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-22\">We conclude that the District Court correctly dismissed Vora\u2019s complaint. Vora was attacking an ongoing state criminal proceeding. Generally, federal courts are required to abstain from involvement in such proceedings. <em>See Younger v. Harris, </em>401 U.S. 37, 43-44, 91 S.Ct. 746, 27 L.Ed.2d 669 (1971). For abstention to be proper, the state proceedings must be judicial in nature, implicate important state interests, and afford an adequate opportunity to raise federal claims. <em>Kendall v. Russell, </em>572 F.3d 126, 131 (3d Cir.2009). Those requirements are met in this case. The criminal proceedings against Vora are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>ongoing, implicate Pennsylvania\u2019s important interest in bringing to justice those who violate its criminal laws, and she will have an opportunity to raise federal claims in defending against the charges. Nor has Vora demonstrated \u201cbad faith, harassment or some other extraordinary circumstance, which might make abstention inappropriate.\u201d <em>Anthony v. Council, </em>316 F.3d 412, 418 (3d Cir.2003). Accordingly, the District Court properly concluded that it lacked jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-4\">We also conclude that the District Court did not abuse its discretion in denying Vora\u2019s motions for reconsideration. <em>See Lazaridis v. Wehmer, </em>591 F.3d 666, 669 (3d Cir.2010). A motion for reconsideration is a limited vehicle used \u201cto correct manifest errors of law or fact or to present newly discovered evidence.\u201d <em>Max\u2019s Seafood Caf\u00e9 ex rel. Lou-Ann, Inc. v. Quinteros, </em>176 F.3d 669, 677 (3d Cir.1999) (citation omitted). A judgment may be altered or amended if the party seeking reconsideration shows one of three grounds: (1) an intervening change in the law; (2) the availability of new evidence; or (3) the need to correct a clear error of law or prevent manifest injustice. <em>Id. </em>Vora did not identify any of these factors in her motions, wherein she merely rehashed arguments that were presented in her previous filings.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-6\">There being no substantial question presented on appeal, we will summarily affirm the judgment of the District Court.3d Cir. LAR 27.4 and I.O.P. 10.6.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
