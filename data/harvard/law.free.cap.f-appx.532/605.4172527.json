STRANCH, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b632-12\">In September 2006, Jeffrey Eberle pled guilty in an Ohio court to aggravated murder and was sentenced to life imprisonment with the possibility of parole. Eberle did not appeal. Nearly three years later, however, Eberle filed a motion to withdraw his guilty plea, which the Ohio courts ultimately denied in December 2010. A year later, Eberle sought habeas relief in federal district court. The state urged that Eberle\u2019s time-barred petition should be dismissed and the district court agreed. We do too and AFFIRM its order dismissing Eberle\u2019s habeas petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-14\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b632-15\">Jeffrey Eberle pled guilty in September 2006 to aggravated murder under Ohio state law. Represented by counsel, Eberle admitted that he \u201cpurposely and with prior calculation\u201d caused the death of Michael Fish. Eberle specifically agreed that on the night of December 14, 2005, he and Jason Evick took Fish to a secluded location where Eberle assaulted Fish with a shovel. Fish died of blunt force trauma. In exchange for his plea, the prosecution dismissed all other charges against Eberle. Eberle was sentenced to life imprisonment with the possibility of parole after serving 20 years.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-16\">Eberle did not appeal from his sentence or conviction but, nearly three years after he was sentenced, he filed a motion to withdraw his guilty plea on July 20, 2009. The motion was based largely on the work of Orrin Nordstrom, a private investigator who tracked down potential leads in Eberle\u2019s case from May 2007 to December 2008. In it, Eberle complained that his trial counsel failed to tell him the contents of an allegedly damaging statement that a witness, Ryan Goodman, planned to make at trial, despite Eberle\u2019s request to learn what Goodman had to say. Eberle also faulted his counsel for failing to investigate the potential testimony of Amanda Fugate, Evick\u2019s girlfriend at the time of Fish\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>murder, who allegedly told police that Evick admitted to killing Fish. And springing from this last factual bit, Eberle finally alleged that the prosecution\u2019s failure to disclose Evick\u2019s admission violated <em>Brady v. Maryland, </em>373 U.S. 83, 83 S.Ct. 1194, 10 L.Ed.2d 215 (1963). To support his claims, Eberle attached affidavits from Goodman, the witness, and Nordstrom, the investigator, and submitted one himself. Eberle\u2019s bottom-line claim was that he would not have pled guilty had he known of Goodman\u2019s statement and Evick\u2019s admission.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-5\">The trial court denied Eberle\u2019s withdrawal motion on September 23, 2009. Eberle sought review in the state court of appeals. As before, he claimed only that he would not have pled guilty but for counsel\u2019s ineffectiveness and the government\u2019s misconduct. During oral arguments, the appellate panel <em>sua sponte </em>asked whether Eberle\u2019s plea was invalid because the trial court wrongly informed Eberle that he was subject to a mandatory five-year term of postrelease control if and when he was released from prison. (The court intuited an error because the crime to which Eberle pled guilty, aggravated murder, is an unclassified felony in Ohio that does not carry a mandatory postrelease-control term. <em>See State v. Clark, </em>119 Ohio St.3d 239, 893 N.E.2d 462, 470 (2008)). The court requested supplemental briefing on the issue, and asked the parties to weigh in on whether Eberle\u2019s case should be returned to the trial court for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-6\">On the merits of Eberle\u2019s claims, the appellate court affirmed the trial court\u2019s denial on August 2, 2010. On the postrelease-control issue, however, the court decided that the trial court erred in its explanation. That error, though, did not necessitate sending the case back down for resentencing; instead, the reviewing court simply vacated the postrelease-control portion of the lower court\u2019s sentencing entry. The Ohio Supreme Court denied Eberle leave to appeal on December 15, 2010.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-8\">A year later, on December 13, 2011, Eberle filed his federal habeas corpus petition setting forth the same grounds of relief raised in his withdrawal motion\u2014 constitutionally ineffective assistance of counsel and governmental misconduct. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254. The magistrate judge concluded that Eberle\u2019s petition was time-barred under two alternative time-limit provisions of the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA), Pub. L. No. 104-132, 110 Stat. 1214 (1996). Under the first, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)(1)(A), the statute of limitations expired in October 2007, one year after the deadline passed to appeal the September 2006 state-court judgment. Despite Eberle\u2019s arguments to the contrary, the magistrate judge found that neither Eberle\u2019s plea-withdrawal motion nor the state appellate court\u2019s sentence modification served to restart the one-year statute of limitations under \u00a7 2244(d)(1)(A). Under the second applicable limitations provision, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)(1)(D), the magistrate judge found that the petition was still untimely, even if the court agreed with Eberle that the clock was tolled while his plea-withdrawal motion wended its way through the state courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-9\">The magistrate judge then considered whether Eberle was entitled to equitable tolling, which might otherwise save his late-filed petition, finding he was not because his failure to file on time did not unavoidably arise from circumstances beyond his control. After finally concluding that Eberle\u2019s claim of actual innocence was untenable, the magistrate judge recommended that Eberle\u2019s time-barred petition be dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number>The district court adopted the magistrate judge\u2019s report. In doing so, it evaluated a supplemental affidavit from Nordstrom \u2014 narrating Nordstrom\u2019s unsuccessful efforts to obtain an affidavit from Fugate directly \u2014 that Eberle submitted along with his objections to the magistrate judge\u2019s report. Even with the supplemental affidavit, the court maintained that Eberle still failed to establish a credible claim of actual innocence that would allow it to consider his otherwise untimely claims. The district court dismissed Eberle\u2019s petition but granted him a certificate of appealability that enables review of \u201cthe procedural statute of limitations issue\u201d raised in Eberle\u2019s case. We turn to that now. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-4\">II. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b634-5\">We review a district court\u2019s dismissal of a time-barred habeas petition de novo, but assess its factual findings \u2014 to the extent it makes any \u2014 under the deferential dear-error standard. <em>King v. Bobby, </em>433 F.3d 483, 489 (6th Cir.2006); <em>Souter v. Jones, </em>395 F.3d 577, 584 (6th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b634-6\">AEDPA sets a one-year statute of limitations for state prisoners seeking federal habeas corpus relief, and lays out four ways to count that period. Just two are relevant here. The one-year filing period may run from \u201cthe date on which the judgment became final by the conclusion of direct review or the expiration of the time for seeking such review.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)(1)(A). Alternatively, it may begin on \u201cthe date on which the factual predicate of the claim or claims presented could have been discovered through the exercise of due diligence.\u201d. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 2244(d)(1)(D). Under either provision, a running limitations period may be tolled when \u201ca properly filed application for State post-conviction or other collateral review with respect to the pertinent judgment or claim is pending.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 2244(d)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b634-8\">A. Finality of the judgment</p>\n<p id=\"b634-9\">Analyzed under \u00a7 2244(d)(1)(A), Eberle was required to file his petition by October 19, 2007. Eberle did not appeal his conviction by the trial court, so it became final on October 19, 2006, 30 days after the court entered its judgment. <em>See </em>Ohio App. R. 4(A). His one-year limitations period thus began to run on October 20, 2006, and expired one year later. Although a tolling action filed during this time could have extended the period, none was filed. Because Eberle did not file a habeas petition until December 13, 2011\u2014 long after October 2007 \u2014 his petition is time-barred under \u00a7 2244(d)(1)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b634-10\">Eberle tries to escape this conclusion in two ways, but neither one helps him. First, he argues that his conviction was not final in 2006 because the plea-withdrawal motion he filed on July 20, 2009, served to \u201creset\u201d the one-year clock with respect to the claims made in it. Eberle contends that as long as a state motion is timely under state law, it is timely for federalhabeas purposes too.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-11\">We see it differently. Although this court has not directly addressed whether a motion to withdraw a guilty plea in Ohio resets AEDPA\u2019s one-year clock or otherwise alters the date on which a conviction becomes \u201cfinal\u201d under \u00a7 2244(d)(1)(A), Eberle\u2019s answer to these questions cuts against the grain of AEDPA\u2019s purpose and our precedents. AEDPA sets strict filing deadlines in order to promote the finality of convictions and curb dilatory tactics. <em>See Carey v. Saffold, </em>536 U.S. 214, 222, 122 S.Ct. 2134, 153 L.Ed.2d 260 (2002) (the one-year filing rule works to \u201cprevent!] prisoners from delaying their federal filing\u201d); <em>Holland v. Florida, </em>560 U.S. 631, 130 S.Ct. 2549, 2562, 177 L.Ed.2d 130 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"609\">*609</page-number>(2010) (\u201cAEDPA seeks to eliminate delays in the federal habeas review process.\u201d). To that end, a conviction is \u201cfinal\u201d under AEDPA once direct review is completed or the time for seeking it expires. But if Eberle\u2019s view were the law \u2014 if after AED-PA\u2019s statute of limitations had fully expired it could be restarted when a petitioner filed a motion to withdraw his guilty plea, even where, as here, the state places no deadline on its filing, <em>see State v. Bush, </em>96 Ohio St.3d 235, 773 N.E.2d 522, 525-26 (2002) \u2014 habeas petitioners could indefinitely extend the limitations period by delaying the filing of a withdrawal motion. This reading flushes the meaning out of AED-PA\u2019s one-year statute of limitations and upends the statute\u2019s goal of heading off unwarranted delay.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-5\">Our cases similarly reject the view that a plea-withdrawal motion restarts AED-PA\u2019s one-year clock. In <em>Searcy v. Carter, </em>we held that the denial of a motion for delayed appeal \u2014 which enables a defendant to file a delayed appeal in Ohio\u2019s high court after the time for seeking it expires \u2014 does not \u201cretrigger[ ]\u201d AEDPA\u2019s statute of limitations. 246 F.3d 515, 519 (6th Cir.2001). We reasoned that holding otherwise would \u201ceffectively eviscerate\u201d the one-year limitation, since a motion for delayed appeal, just like a plea-withdrawal motion, can be sought \u201cat any time, even many years after conviction.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted). AEDPA\u2019s statute-of-limitations provision would thus be \u201cmeaningless\u201d and \u201ceffectively eliminated.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted). A year earlier, in <em>Bronaugh v. Ohio, </em>we similarly concluded that 2244(d)(l)(A)\u2019s one-year clock does not run anew after an Ohio appellate court denies a defendant\u2019s application to reopen his direct appeal due to ineffective assistance of appellate counsel. 235 F.3d 280, 286 (6th Cir.2000); <em>see also </em>Ohio R.App. P. 26(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b635-6\">The upshot of these cases is twofold. First, they rebut Eberle\u2019s claim that the permanent availability of state-made avenues to challenge the validity of a conviction or sentence bars a conviction from ever becoming final for AEDPA purposes. And second, they reflect that resort to such avenues will not necessarily restart the one-year limitations period. (That said, both <em>Searcy </em>and <em>Bronaugh </em>recognize that the review procedures in question may toll the limitations period. Tolling, though, \u201ccan only serve to pause a clock that has not yet fully run\u201d; it does not \u201crevive the limitations period\u201d or \u201crestart the clock at zero.\u201d <em>Vroman v. Brigano, </em>346 F.3d 598, 602 (6th Cir.2003) (internal quotation marks omitted). So while Eberle\u2019s plea-withdrawal motion could have stopped the running of the clock had it been filed in the one-year window that closed in October 2007, it was not filed then. After the window closed, there was nothing left to toll.)</p>\n<p id=\"b635-7\">Eberle responds that he could not litigate his \u00a7 2254 petition until fully appealing his plea-withdrawal motion in state court because he was required to exhaust his state remedies. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(b)(1)(A). Exhaustion under AED-PA requires a petitioner to \u201cfairly present!]\u201d each claim in a \u00a7 2254 petition to the state courts before a federal court can review it. <em>See Wagner v. Smith, </em>581 F.3d 410, 414 (6th Cir.2009) (internal quotation marks omitted). But we have never suggested that a habeas petitioner in Ohio must file a plea-withdrawal motion to properly exhaust his claims. Put simply, a failure to file this motion does not render a petitioner\u2019s habeas claims unexhausted.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-8\">To escape the conclusion that his petition is time-barred under \u00a7 2244(d)(1)(A), Eberle presses an alternative argument\u2014 that the August 2, 2010 appellate court decision vacating the part of the trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"610\">*610</page-number>court\u2019s sentencing entry that imposed postrelease control amounted to a new sentence that, in turn, restarted the statute of limitations. Eberle\u2019s claim is based on the concept that a judgment is only \u201cfinal\u201d under \u00a7 2244(d)(1)(A) after direct review of both the conviction <em>and </em>the sentence. <em>See Burton v. Stewart, </em>549 U.S. 147, 156, 127 S.Ct. 793, 166 L.Ed.2d 628 (2007) (per curiam) (\u201cFinal judgment in a criminal case means sentence. The sentence is the judgment.\u201d) (internal quotation marks omitted). So, for example, in the case of a petitioner whose conviction is affirmed on direct review but whose case is remanded for resentencing because his initial sentence is infirm for some reason, the judgment is \u201cfinal\u201d only after direct review of the punishment imposed at resentencing. <em>See Rashad v. Lafler, </em>675 F.3d 564, 567-69 (6th Cir.2012). As a result, the AEDPA clock resets then.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-4\">But does <em>any </em>sentencing modification constitute a \u201cresentencing\u201d sufficient to restart the limitations period? We don\u2019t see how it can. Take two examples. First, we have recognized (albeit in an unpublished order) that when \u201ca federal prisoner is resentenced following a Rule 35(b) motion [to reduce a sentence for substantial assistance] ..., the statute of limitations does not start from the date of the resentencing judgment.\u201d <em>Reichert v. United States, </em>101 Fed.App.x 13, 14 (6th Cir.2004) (order). Other circuits have reached a similar conclusion. <em>See, e.g., Murphy v. United States, </em>634 F.3d 1303, 1313 (11th Cir.2011); <em>United States v. Sanders, </em>247 F.3d 139, 142-43 (4th Cir.2001). As well, a modification of a previously imposed sentence to afford presentence credits also does not affect the date on which finality attaches for statute-of-limitations purposes. <em>See, e.g., Graham v. Smelser, </em>422 Fed.Appx. 705, 707 (10th Cir.2011). These authorities indicate that not every modification that can be made to a sentence <em>automatically </em>restarts the statute of limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-6\">This case, however, does not require us to sort out where the precise line lies between sentence modifications that are insufficient to restart the limitations period on the one hand, and new sentences that are sufficient to do so on the other. Without laying down a rule to distinguish the two poles, two observations about the alteration made to Eberle\u2019s sentence persuade us that it did not delay finality for habeas purposes. First, Eberle\u2019s sentence was modified to remedy a technical error. The change did not pertain to his underlying conviction, nor did it relate to the basis of the plea bargain Eberle struck with the state. Second, as a technical error, his sentence was not remanded to the trial court: no resentencing hearing was held, no new sentencing entry was filed, and no new judgment issued. In these circumstances, a single sentence modification\u2014 which, notably, Eberle did not raise in his withdrawal motion \u2014 is not a new sentence that restarts the AEDPA clock.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-7\">Eberle\u2019s petition is time-barred under \u00a7 2244(d)(1)(A), unless statutory or equitable-tolling principles apply. We next consider whether Eberle\u2019s petition fares any better under \u00a7 2244(d)(1)(D), the only other statutory means to measure AEDPA\u2019s limitations period in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-8\">B. Discovery of the factual predicate</p>\n<p id=\"b636-9\">Eberle alternatively argues that his petition is timely under \u00a7 2244(d)(1)(D), which allows the one-year filing period to run from \u201cthe date on which the factual predicate of the claim or claims presented could have been discovered through the exercise of due diligence.\u201d But even if we credit Eberle\u2019s contention that his claims could not have been raised earlier, we still can\u2019t see how Eberle\u2019s petition was filed within the limitations period.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"611\">*611</page-number>The timeline is critical to bear in mind. Eberle was convicted and sentenced on September 19, 2006. Beginning in May 2007 and continuing through December 2008, Nordstrom, Eberle\u2019s private investigator, tracked down potential witnesses with information regarding the murder. Nordstrom\u2019s affidavit, submitted with Eberle\u2019s habeas petition, provides two facts on which Eberle heavily relies. The first is that Amanda Fugate, Jason Evick\u2019s girlfriend at the time of Michael Fish\u2019s death, told Nordstrom that Evick confessed to her that he killed Fish (a confession Fugate allegedly reported to the police). The second is that Fish and Jeff Weldon, a potential unindicted coconspirator, had an antagonistic relationship due to their involvement in illegal drug trafficking.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-5\">Although the magistrate judge assumed without deciding that Eberle\u2019s petition began to run on May 26, 2009, the day that Eberle signed an affidavit recounting the details Nordstrom learned through his investigation, we cannot do the same. Eberle \u201cbears the burden of proving that he exercised due diligence\u201d in order for the statute of limitations to run from the date he discovered the factual predicate of his claim. <em>DiCenzi v. Rose, </em>452 F.3d 465, 471 (6th Cir.2006). Recall that Nordstrom wrapped up his investigation \u2014 which discovered each of the factual predicates of Eberle\u2019s claims for habeas relief \u2014 in December 2008. Yet it took Eberle five months to execute his own affidavit, and two more months to file the withdrawal motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-6\">The problem is less the delay and more Eberle\u2019s failure to explain it. Eberle may not have been able to file his affidavit or the plea-withdrawal motion sooner for many reasons \u2014 a medical condition, prison transfer, or an inability to communicate with Nordstrom, for example. But Eberle has offered no facts for us to decipher the reasons behind the delay. In light of this failure, and the fact that Eberle was counseled throughout these proceedings, Eberle has not made the showing necessary to extend the start of the limitations period under \u00a7 2244(d)(1)(D) beyond December 31, 2008, the latest date on which Nordstrom completed his investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-8\">If Eberle\u2019s one-year limitations period began on December 31, 2008, 201 days passed before Eberle filed his plea-withdrawal motion on July 20, 2009. The parties agree that the limitations period was tolled until the Ohio Supreme Court denied Eberle leave to appeal on December 15, 2010. They disagree, however, as to whether the 90-day period to apply for a writ of certiorari to the United States Supreme Court following the Ohio Supreme Court\u2019s denial paused the clock. The underlying question is whether a plea-withdrawal motion under Ohio law is properly characterized as post-conviction or collateral relief (the state\u2019s position), or part of a defendant\u2019s direct appeal (Eberle\u2019s view). If such a motion is collateral relief for AEDPA purposes, then there is no tolling during the 90-day period. <em>See Lawrence v. Florida, </em>549 U.S. 327, 332, 127 S.Ct. 1079, 166 L.Ed.2d 924 (2007); <em>see also Sherwood v. Prelesnik, </em>579 F.3d 581, 588 (6th Cir.2009). But if a plea-withdrawal motion is considered part of direct review, then the 90-day period may be tolled. <em>See Clay v. United States, </em>537 U.S. 522, 527-28, 123 S.Ct. 1072, 155 L.Ed.2d 88 (2003) (holding that \u201cdirect review\u201d of a judgment of conviction is not \u201cfinal\u201d until the United States Supreme Court has declined review or decided the case on the merits).</p>\n<p id=\"b637-9\">We are not the first court to confront this question. In <em>Bush, </em>the Ohio Supreme Court held that because a plea-withdrawal motion \u201ctargets the withdrawal of a plea\u201d and is \u201cnot a collateral challenge to the validity of a conviction or sentence,\u201d it is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"612\">*612</page-number>properly seen as a part of the direct-review process. 773 N.E.2d at 526 (internal quotation marks omitted); <em>see also Colwell v. Tanner, </em>79 Fed.Appx. 89, 91 (6th Cir. 2003) (stating in dicta that a plea-withdrawal motion falls within direct review). <em>Bush, </em>however, is \u201cauthoritative only as a matter of state law,\u201d not AEDPA. <em>Lopez v. Wilson, </em>426 F.3d 339, 351 (6th Cir.2005) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b638-4\">We don\u2019t have to delve too deeply into the issue here, however, since Eberle\u2019s petition is untimely whether or not the AEDPA clock paused during the 90-day period. As noted, Eberle used up 201 of the 365 days he had to file his petition between the time he discovered the factual predicate of his claims on December 31, 2008, and when he submitted his plea-withdrawal motion on July 20, 2009. The Ohio Supreme Court denied Eberle leave to appeal on December 15, 2010. Even if we were to hold that the limitations period was tolled for the next 90 days, this only takes Eberle through to March 15, 2011, after which the clock began to tick again. From that point until Eberle filed his petition on December 13, 2011, 273 days passed. Put otherwise, Eberle had until August 26, 2011, to file his petition under \u00a7 2244(d)(1)(D). Because he did not do so, his petition is time-barred.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-5\">C. Equitable tolling</p>\n<p id=\"b638-6\">That is true, of course, unless Eberle is entitled to equitable tolling. This doctrine, which applies to AEDPA\u2019s limitations period, <em>see Holland, </em>130 S.Ct. at 2560, may serve to save an otherwise untimely petition if \u201ca litigant\u2019s failure to meet a legally-mandated deadline unavoidably arose from circumstances beyond that litigant\u2019s control,\u201d <em>Hall v. Warden, Lebanon Corr. Inst., </em>662 F.3d 745, 749 (6th Cir.2011) (internal quotation marks omitted), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 133 S.Ct. 187, 184 L.Ed.2d 95 (2012) . To be eligible, Eberle must show that (1) \u201che has been pursuing his rights diligently\u201d and (2) \u201csome extraordinary circumstance stood in his way\u201d to foreclose timely filing. <em>Holland, </em>130 S.Ct. at 2562 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b638-8\">Eberle says he couldn\u2019t file his claims earlier because \u201che only learned of the evidence proving his innocence\u201d after Nordstrom\u2019s investigation. But that was in December 2008. The issue is Eberle\u2019s quiescence afterwards \u2014 the nearly five months it took to submit his own affidavit, and the two additional months to file the plea-withdrawal motion. Absent an explanation for these delays, Eberle\u2019s diligence is difficult to spot. Because Eberle\u2019s equitable-tolling argument fails at <em>Holland\u2019s </em>first step, we move on without looking into the second.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-9\">D. Actual innocence</p>\n<p id=\"b638-10\">Notwithstanding that, Eberle insists that he can successfully pass through the actual-innocence gateway. If that were so \u2014 and it is not \u2014 Eberle\u2019s lack of diligence would not stand in the way of our consideration of his otherwise untimely petition. In <em>McQuiggin v. Perkins, </em>the Supreme Court recently held that a showing of actual innocence works to \u201covercome\u201d AEDPA\u2019s statute of limitations, and not simply to excuse late filing. \u2014 U.S. \u2014, 133 S.Ct. 1924, 1930-31, 185 L.Ed.2d 1019 (2013) . When faced with a \u201cconvincing\u201d actual-innocence claim, <em>McQuiggin </em>makes clear, a court cannot consider a petition\u2019s untimeliness as \u201can absolute barrier to relief.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1928. Although a petitioner who asserts a convincing actual-innocence claim does not have to \u201cprove diligence to cross a federal court\u2019s threshold,\u201d timing remains \u201ca factor relevant in evaluating the reliability of a petitioner\u2019s proof of innocence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1935 (\u201cUnexplained delay in presenting new evidence bears on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"613\">*613</page-number>the determination whether the petitioner has made the requisite showing.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b639-5\">In addition to clarifying that there are no temporal limitations to presenting evidence in support of an actual-innocence claim, <em>McQuiggin </em>also reiterated the standard needed to make one out. <em>Id. </em>at 1931. The touchstone of the inquiry is whether a petitioner\u2019s \u201cnew evidence shows \u2018it is more likely than not that no reasonable juror would have convicted [him].\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1933 (quoting <em>Schlup v. Delo, </em>513 U.S. 298, 329, 115 S.Ct. 851, 130 L.Ed.2d 808 (1995)). To assess that question, a court must survey \u201call the evidence, old and new, incriminating and exculpatory, without regard to whether it would necessarily be admitted under rules of admissibility that would govern at trial.\u201d <em>House v. Bell, </em>547 U.S. 518, 538, 126 S.Ct. 2064, 165 L.Ed.2d 1 (2006) (internal quotation marks omitted). With \u201call the evidence\u201d thus in mind, the court\u2019s final task is \u201cto assess the likely impact of the evidence on reasonable jurors\u201d; it is not to work through an \u201cindependent factual determination\u201d to divine \u201cwhat likely occurred.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b639-6\">Does Eberle\u2019s new evidence, taken together with the old, establish \u201cthat it is more likely than not that no reasonable juror would have found [him] guilty beyond a reasonable doubt\u201d? <em>Schlup, </em>513 U.S. at 327, 115 S.Ct. 851. We cannot say it does. The new evidence Eberle presents consists of three core facts. The first is a statement Ryan Goodman made that Eberle mistakenly believes is exculpatory. The second is Nordstrom\u2019s report that Fugate revealed to him that she told the police that Evick confessed to killing Fish. And the last is Nordstrom\u2019s remark that Fish and Jeff Weldon had an antagonistic relationship due to their involvement in drug trafficking.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-7\">We begin with Goodman\u2019s statement. Eberle claims that had he had known of it before he pled guilty, he would not have taken the plea deal. Goodman, it turns out, planned to testify that Eberle said only one thing to Goodman about Fish: \u201cMotherfucker tried to play us so we got him.\u201d If anything, Goodman\u2019s statement supports Eberle\u2019s guilt. It blinks reality to suggest that Eberle\u2019s statement \u2014 \u201cwe got him\u201d \u2014 makes it \u201cmore likely than not that no reasonable juror would have convicted\u201d Eberle. <em>McQuiggin, </em>133 S.Ct. at 1933 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b639-8\">Fugate\u2019s statement to Nordstrom gets a bit closer, but just barely. While Eberle alleges it exonerates him, we disagree for three reasons (all of which apply with equal force to Nordstrom\u2019s supplemental affidavit). First, Fugate\u2019s statement in Nordstrom\u2019s affidavit is hearsay-within-hearsay evidence. <em>See </em>Ohio R. Evid. 805. While that isn\u2019t disqualifying in itself \u2014 a court, after all, must consider \u201call the evidence ... without regard to whether it would necessarily be admitted under rules of admissibility,\u201d <em>House, </em>547 U.S. at 538, 126 S.Ct. 2064 (internal quotation marks omitted) \u2014 a juror could reasonably discount Fugate\u2019s statement insofar as it is less reliable than direct testimony. <em>See Knickerbocker v. Wolfenbarger, </em>212 Fed.Appx. 426, 433 (6th Cir.2007). Second, Fugate\u2019s statement, even if reliable, stands against Eberle\u2019s admission that he \u201cpurposely and with prior calculation\u201d caused Fish\u2019s death. Eberle stipulated that he and Jason Evick took Fish to a secluded location where Eberle assaulted Fish with a shovel. Third, Fugate\u2019s statement at most supports the view that Eberle was only complicit in Fish\u2019s death. Even if that were so, Eberle could still be convicted as the principal offender. <em>See </em>Ohio Rev.Code \u00a7 2923.03(F) (a complicit defendant \u201cshall be prosecuted and punished as if he were a principal offender\u201d). Eberle <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"614\">*614</page-number>notably does not argue that Fugate\u2019s statement undermines any element of the offense he pled guilty to, and that is fatal to his actual-innocence claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-4\">The final fact Eberle relies on to prove his claim is Nordstrom\u2019s remark that Fish and Jeff Weldon somehow clashed over their involvement in drug trafficking. Ignore for the moment that the source of Nordstrom\u2019s report is unknown and the statement is otherwise vague. (What involvement did the parties have in drug trafficking? When did it occur? Why was the relationship antagonistic?) The bigger problem is that this statement suggests no more than that another person quarreled with Fish and so may have had a motive to harm him. Finally, the first and second reasons for rejecting Fugate\u2019s statement as evidence of actual innocence apply to the Weldon story as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-5\">To wrap it up, then, Eberle\u2019s actual-innocence evidence, even if new, is not adequate to show that no reasonable juror would have convicted him. <em>See McQuiggin, </em>133 S.Ct. at 1936.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-6\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b640-7\">Because no statutory basis exists to save Eberle\u2019s time-barred petition, and Eberle is unable to make a credible claim of actual innocence or demonstrate his entitlement to equitable tolling, we AFFIRM the district court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
