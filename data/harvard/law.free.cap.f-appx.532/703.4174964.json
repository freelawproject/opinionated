The petition will be denied in part and dismissed in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-14\">1. Iraheta first argues that the BIA erroneously barred his asylum claim as untimely. He concedes that his application was filed outside of the one-year period for filing an asylum claim, but he asserts that the time bar should be excused due to extraordinary circumstances. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(2). We \u201cmay review the agency\u2019s application of the changed or extraordinary circumstances exception to undisputed facts.\u201d <em>Singh v. Holder, </em>656 F.3d 1047,1051 (9th Cir.2011). Iraheta appears to argue that he delayed filing for asylum because he thought \u2014 in part due to alleged immigration consultant fraud \u2014 that his pending application for Temporary Protected Status (\u201cTPS\u201d) would afford him relief more quickly. But, as the BIA recognized, even assuming the TPS application could effectively toll the limitations period, Iraheta filed for TPS after the period had expired. Accordingly, the BIA\u2019s time bar ruling was supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-15\">2. The BIA also properly denied Iraheta\u2019s application for withholding of removal. That application centered on Iraheta\u2019s allegation that he had been persecuted in El Salvador because he resisted efforts to recruit him into the Mara Salvatrucha gang. But in a nearly identical context, we held that \u201cyoung Honduran men who have been recruited by the MS-13, but who refuse to join\u201d do not qualify as a particular social group. <em>See Ramos-Lopez v. Holder, </em>563 F.3d 855, 858 (9th Cir.2009) (granting deference to <em>Matter of S-E-G, </em>24 I &amp; N Dec. 579 (BIA 2008)).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In other words, we have already rejected <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"705\">*705</page-number>the theory of persecution that Iraheta presses in this petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-5\">Nor does the United Nations High Commissioner on Refugees\u2019 March 2010 Guidance Note<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> demand a different result. Such statements can have persuasive force, but \u201c[i]f the Attorney General\u2019s interpretation is permissible in light of the statute\u2019s text, structure and purpose, we must defer under <em>Chevron </em>to the Attorney General\u2019s interpretation even if it is in tension with the UNHCR Handbook.\u201d <em>Miguel-Miguel v. Gonzales, </em>500 F.3d 941, 949 (9th Cir.2007). Here, the Attorney General\u2019s interpretation of \u201cparticular social group\u201d is permissible, and thus the Guidance Note cannot save Iraheta\u2019s claim. <em>See Ramos-Lopez, </em>563 F.3d at 858-62.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b731-6\">3. The BIA\u2019s denial of relief under the Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d) was supported by substantial evidence. <em>First, </em>although past torture can support a claim for CAT relief, 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.16(c)(3), the primary evidence of harm in this case was periodic and unspecified beatings during robberies, the pointing of a gun at Iraheta\u2019s head, and threats made against Iraheta. These facts, taken as true, do not compel the conclusion that Iraheta is more likely than not to be tortured if he returns to El Salvador. <em>See, e.g., Lopez-Cardona v. Holder, </em>662 F.3d 1110, 1114 (9th Cir.2011). <em>Second, </em>the BIA permissibly concluded that the Salvadoran government would not consent to, or acquiesce in, gang violence against Iraheta. For example, Iraheta himself testified that police officers had come to guard his home after he reported one incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-9\">4. Iraheta also asserts that the BIA erroneously found him ineligible for voluntary departure. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1240.26(c). However, because the denial was discretionary, we lack jurisdiction to consider this claimed error. <em>See Gomez-Lopez v. Ashcroft, </em>393 F.3d 882, 886 (9th Cir.2005); 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229c(f). Although Iraheta frames the IJ and BIA\u2019s rulings as refusals to exercise discretion, the record shows that the rulings rested on a discretionary determination that Iraheta lacked the moral character necessary for eligibility for voluntary departure. This claim of error, accordingly, is dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-10\">PETITION DENIED in part and DISMISSED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b730-12\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir. R. 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b730-13\">. Although <em>Ramos-Lopez </em>was partially abrogated in <em>Henriquez-Rivas v. Holder, </em>707 F.3d 1081 (9th Cir.2013) (en banc), its central holding remains good law. <em>See id. </em>at 1093 (limiting <em>Ramos-Lopez </em>only by asserting that \"[t]o the extent that ... Ramos-Lopez ... mischaracterized the 'social visibility\u2019 requirement by requiring \u2018on-sight\u2019 visibility, [it is] no longer good law\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b731-7\">. <em>See </em>United Nations High Comm\u2019r for Refugees, <em>Guidance Note on Refugee Claims Relating to Victims of Organized Gangs </em>(March 2010), <em>available at </em>http://www.refworld.org/ docid/4bb21 fa02.html.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b731-8\">. Iraheta\u2019s claim that he was persecuted based on his political opinion is also foreclosed by <em>Ramos-Lopez.
