Robert C. GREEN, Defendant-Appellant.</parties>\n<docketnumber data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"docketnumber\" id=\"b552-13\">No. 11-31216</docketnumber>\n<p data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"misc\" id=\"Abu\">Summary Calendar.</p>\n<court data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"court\" id=\"b552-14\">United States Court of Appeals, Fifth Circuit.</court>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"b552-16\">April 17, 2013.</decisiondate>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b552-17\">Camille Ann Domingue, Assistant U.S. Attorney, Myers P.

Green has moved for leave to withdraw and has filed briefs in accordance with <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), and <em>United States v. Flores, </em>632 F.3d 229 (5th Cir.2011). Green has filed a response.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-23\">In his response, Green alleges that his request for a new counsel should have been granted and that his attorney failed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>to make \u201csimple but very, very important objection[s].\u201d To the extent that this allegation is an effort to raise an ineffective assistance of counsel claim, we conclude that the record is insufficiently developed to allow consideration at this time of such a claim. <em>See United States v. Cantwell, </em>470 F.3d 1087, 1091 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b553-5\">We have reviewed counsel\u2019s brief and the relevant portions of the record reflected therein, as well as Green\u2019s response. We concur with counsel\u2019s assessment that the appeal presents no nonfrivolous issue for appellate review. Accordingly, counsel\u2019s motion for leave to withdraw is GRANTED, counsel is excused from further responsibilities herein, and the APPEAL IS DISMISSED. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b552-24\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
