Because this appeal does not present a substantial question, we will summarily affirm the District Court\u2019s judgment. <em>See </em>3d Cir. L.A.R. 27.4; I.O.P. 10.6.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-20\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-21\">In 1999, Rinaldi was convicted of various drug trafficking and firearms charges. The District Court sentenced him to a total of 248 months\u2019 incarceration. We affirmed. <em>See United States v. Rinaldi, </em>248 F.3d 1131 (3d Cir.2000). In his \u00a7 2241 petition, Rinaldi asserted that he is actually innocent because his conduct did not affect interstate commerce and because criminalizing \u201cpurely local conduct\u201d exceeds Congress\u2019 power under the Tenth Amendment. Rinaldi argued that he could not raise his claim until the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Bond v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 131 S.Ct. 2355, 2366, 180 L.Ed.2d 269 (2011), which held that a criminal defendant has standing to pursue a Tenth Amendment challenge to the statute under which he was charged as an unjustifiable expansion of federal law enforcement into a state-regulated domain. As relief, Rinaldi asked to have his convictions vacated and to be released from custody. The District Court dismissed Rinaldi\u2019s \u00a7 2241 petition. This timely appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>ii.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-5\">We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1291 and 2253(a).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We exercise plenary review over the dismissal of Rinaldi\u2019s petition. <em>See Vega v. United States, </em>493 F.3d 310, 314 (3d Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b91-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-7\">Generally, federal prisoners challenge the validity of their convictions or sentences through motions pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. <em>See Davis v. United States, </em>417 U.S. 333, 343, 94 S.Ct. 2298, 41 L.Ed.2d 109 (1974). Section 2255 expressly prohibits a district court from considering a challenge to a prisoner\u2019s federal sentence under \u00a7 2241 unless the remedy under \u00a7 2255 is \u201cinadequate or ineffective to test the legality of his detention.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(e); <em>see also Cradle v. United States ex rel. Miner, </em>290 F.3d 536, 538 (3d Cir.2002); <em>In re Dorsainvil, </em>119 F.3d 245, 251 (3d Cir.1997). A motion under \u00a7 2255 is not \u201cinadequate or ineffective\u201d simply because the petitioner cannot meet the gatekeeping requirements of \u00a7 2255. However, this Court has held that \u00a7 2255 is \u201cinadequate or ineffective\u201d to test the legality of a conviction where a petitioner \u201cis being detained for conduct that has subsequently been rendered non-criminal by an intervening Supreme Court decision,\u201d and where the petitioner is otherwise barred from filing a second or successive \u00a7 2255 motion.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>In re Dorsainvil, </em>119 F.3d at 252. In such a case, a petitioner may seek habeas relief under \u00a7 2241. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b91-12\">Here, Rinaldi asserts that under <em>Bond, </em>he can now argue that the statutes under which he was convicted \u2014 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841 and 846 \u2014 violate the Tenth Amendment by criminalizing \u201cpurely local conduct.\u201d However, neither <em>Bond </em>nor another intervening change in the law has rendered the conduct for which Rinaldi was convicted\u2014 drug trafficking and firearms offenses\u2014 non-criminal, and so he cannot proceed under \u00a7 2241.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Accordingly, the District Court properly dismissed his \u00a7 2241 petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-13\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-14\">For the foregoing reasons, no substantial question is presented and we will summarily affirm the District Court\u2019s judgment. <em>Murray v. Bledsoe, </em>650 F.3d 246, 247 (3d Cir.2011) (per curiam); <em>see </em>3d Cir. L.A.R. 27.4; I.O.P. 10.6.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b91-8\">. A certificate of appealability is not required to appeal the dismissal of a \u00a7 2241 petition. <em>See Burkey v. Marberry, </em>556 F.3d 142, 146 (3d Cir.2009).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b91-9\">. Rinaldi cannot meet the requirements for filing a second or successive \u00a7 2255 motion, which requires either \"(1) newly discovered evidence that, if proven and viewed in light of the evidence as a whole, would be sufficient to establish by clear and convincing evidence that no reasonable factfinder would have found the movant guilty of the offense,\u201d or \"(2) a new rule of constitutional law, made retroactive to cases on collateral review by the Supreme Court, that was previously unavailable.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(h). Rinaldi's petition asserts neither.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b91-16\">. It is well settled, and Congress has explicitly noted, that drug trafficking activities affect interstate commerce. <em>See </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 801(3) (\"[(Incidents of the traffic which are not an integral part of the interstate or foreign flow, such as manufacture, local distribution, and possession, nonetheless have a substantial and direct effect upon interstate commerce\u201d). The federal drug trafficking statutes are valid exercises of Congress' power under the Commerce Clause. <em>See, e.g., Gonzales v. Raich, </em>545 U.S. 1, 22, 125 S.Ct. 2195, 162 L.Ed.2d 1 (2005); <em>United States v. Orozco, </em>98 F.3d 105, 107 (3d Cir. 1996).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
