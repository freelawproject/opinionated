We deny the petition for review. Because the parties are familiar with the facts and history of the case, we need not recount it here. We review the denial of a motion to reopen for abuse of discretion, so \u201c[t]he decision of the BIA should be left undisturbed unless it is \u2018arbitrary, irrational, or contrary to law.\u2019 \u201d <em>Chang Hua He v. Gonzales, </em>501 F.3d 1128, 1131 (9th Cir.2007) (quoting <em>Singh v. INS, </em>295 F.3d 1037, 1039 (9th Cir.2002)).</p>\n<p id=\"b763-22\">The BIA did not abuse its discretion in concluding that Jiang failed to \u201cestablish prima facie eligibility for the relief sought.\u201d <em>Feng Gui Lin v. Holder, </em>588 F.3d 981, 986 (9th Cir.2009) (internal quotation marks omitted); <em>see Ordonez v. INS, </em>345 F.3d 777, 785 (9th Cir.2003). \u201c[T]he starting point for determining whether there is objective evidence supporting this fear [of returning to China] is proof of the details of the family planning policy relevant to each individual case.\u201d <em>In re J-H-S- </em>24 I. &amp; N. Dec. 196, 198 (BIA 2007). \u201cIf an applicant has established the details of the specific \u2018policy1 applicable in his or her case, a related inquiry arises as to whether the facts in the record establish that the alien violated the policy.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 199. \u201cAssuming that this burden [of showing a policy and violation] has been met, the alien must also establish that the violation of the family planning policy would be punished in the local area in a way that would give rise to an objective fear of future persecution.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b763-23\">In this case, the BIA did not abuse its discretion in concluding that Jiang had not shown that she violated the family planning policy when she gave birth to two children in the United States or that she would suffer persecution in China as a result. Given the evidence in the record, the BIA\u2019s conclusion that \u201cthere is insufficient indication that such economic sanctions (if levied) would constitute persecution in this case\u201d was not \u201carbitrary, irrational, or contrary to law.\u201d <em>Chang </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"738\">*738</page-number><em>Hua He, </em>501 F.3d at 1131 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b764-4\">We also reject Jiang\u2019s arguments that the BIA failed to adequately consider, weigh, or address her evidence. <em>See Feng Gui Lin, </em>588 F.3d at 987 (explaining that the BIA \u201cneed not expressly refute on the record every single piece of evidence\u201d); <em>accord Najmabadi v.
