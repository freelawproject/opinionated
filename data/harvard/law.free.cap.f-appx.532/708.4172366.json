State Defendants-Appellants James Connelley and Dennis Journigan appeal the district court\u2019s denial of their motion for summary judgment. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292(a)(1) and \u00a7 1291 (under the collateral order doctrine). <em>See Mitchell v. Forsyth, </em>472 U.S, 511, 530, 105 S.Ct. 2806, 86 L.Ed.2d 411 (1985). We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-4\">1. The district court abused its discretion in requiring BLM to withdraw its certification of Yowell\u2019s debt to Treasury-FMS. A court abuses its discretion where it fails to identify or apply the correct legal rule, where its failure to make findings of fact and conclusions of law preclude a full understanding of the court\u2019s decision, or where its application of the correct legal standard is illogical, implausible, or without support. <em>Pimentel v. Dreyfus, </em>670 F.3d 1096, 1105 (9th Cir.2012); <em>Park Vill. Apartment Tenants Ass\u2019n v. Mortimer Howard Trust, </em>636 F.3d 1150, 1155 (9th Cir.2011); <em>Federal Trade Comm. v. Enforma Natural Products, Inc., </em>362 F.3d 1204, 1212 (9th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b736-5\">The district court\u2019s injunction suffers from all three problems. Specifically, the district court failed to identify and apply the correct standard for granting an injunction. <em>See Winter v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., </em>555 U.S. 7, 20, 129 S.Ct. 365, 172 L.Ed.2d 249 (2008); <em>eBay Inc. v. MercExchange, LLC, </em>547 U.S. 388, 391, 126 S.Ct. 1837, 164 L.Ed.2d 641 (2006). The district court failed to make the findings of fact and conclusions of law required by Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 52(a)(l)-(2) and 65, -without which we cannot discern the basis for the court\u2019s decision. <em>See Enforma Natural Products, Inc., </em>362 F.3d at 1212. Finally, the district court\u2019s conclusions that Yowell had no pre-deprivation hearing before BLM impounded and sold his cattle, and that Yo-well was not aware of the impoundment, cannot form the basis for the injunction. We conclude, for the reasons we have previously set forth, that BLM was not required to provide a pre-deprivation hearing. <em>See Klump v. Babbitt, </em>No. 95-16109, 1997 WL 121193, *2 (9th Cir. Mar. 17, 1997). Furthermore, Yowell plainly was aware of the impoundment before it happened, as evidenced by BLM\u2019s notices to Yowell and Yowell\u2019s own efforts to contest BLM\u2019s actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-11\">2. The district court erred in denying the Federal Defendants-Appellants\u2019 motion to dismiss and motion for reconsideration. First, no action under <em>Bivens v. Six Unknown Agents of Federal Bureau of Narcotics, </em>403 U.S. 388, 91 S.Ct. 1999, 29 L.Ed.2d 619 (1971), may lie against federal agencies like Treasury-FMS. <em>See FDIC v. Meyer, </em>510 U.S. 471, 484-86, 114 S.Ct. 996, 127 L.Ed.2d 308 (1994); <em>Jachetta v. United States, </em>653 F.3d 898, 908 (9th Cir. 2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b736-12\">Second, no <em>Bivens </em>action may lie against federal officials for \u201cstrictly enforcing rules against trespass or conditions on grazing permits.\u201d <em>Wilkie v. Robbins, </em>551 U.S. 537, 557, 127 S.Ct. 2588, 168 L.Ed.2d 389 (2007).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b736-13\">Third, even if Yowell could assert <em>Bivens </em>claims against the individual Fed<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"711\">*711</page-number>eral Defendants-Appellants notwithstanding <em>Wilkie, </em>they are entitled to qualified immunity. Yowell does not tie any allegedly unlawful behavior to the individual Federal Defendants-Appellants. <em>See Ashcroft v. Iqbal, </em>556 U.S. 662, 676, 129 S.Ct. 1987, 178 L.Ed.2d 868 (2009) (\u201cBecause vicarious liability is inapplicable to <em>Bivens </em>and \u00a7 1983 suits, a plaintiff must plead that each Government-official defendant, through the official\u2019s own individual actions, has violated the Constitution.\u201d). More problematic, Yowell fails to show that the Federal Defendants-Appellants caused him to be deprived of a clearly established federal right. <em>See Van Strum v. Lawn, </em>940 F.2d 406, 409 (9th Cir.1991). As Yowell concedes, the Federal Defendants-Appellants were following BLM regulations when they seized and sold his cattle, and Treasury-FMS regulations when they certified his grazing debt. No court has held that those regulations violate due process. Thus, it cannot be said that \u201cevery reasonable official would [have understood] that what he is doing violates\u201d any clearly established federal right. <em>Reichle v. Howards, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 132 S.Ct. 2088, 2090, 182 L.Ed.2d 985 (2012) (quotation marks omitted) (alteration in Reichle).</p>\n<p id=\"b737-7\">3. The district court erred in denying the State Defendants-Appellants\u2019 motion for summary judgment. As an initial matter, the State Defendants-Appellants are eligible for qualified immunity because their actions were discretionary, not ministerial, under applicable state law. <em>See </em>Nev.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 565.130(1). Qualified immunity applies here because Yowell fails to establish that the State Defendants-Appellants either failed to follow the applicable state law, which thereby caused him to be deprived of a clearly established federal right, or that the state law is itself \u201cpatently violative of fundamental constitutional principles.\u201d <em>Cmty. House, Inc. v. City of Boise, Idaho, </em>623 F.3d 945, 965 (9th Cir.2010). To the contrary, the State Defendants-Appellants followed the applicable brand inspection procedures and communicated with Yowell as those procedures and BLM\u2019s regulations required; nothing obligated the Defendants to dispute BLM\u2019s impoundment and sale of Yo-well\u2019s cattle. No court, moreover, has concluded that Nevada\u2019s brand inspection procedures violate federal law.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-10\">Accordingly, the district court\u2019s orders denying the Federal Defendants-Appellants\u2019 motions to dismiss and for reconsideration, as well as the State Defendants-Appellants\u2019 motion for summary judgment, are REVERSED. The district court\u2019s injunction is VACATED. The case is REMANDED for further proceedings consistent with this disposition.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b735-24\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir. R. 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b736-6\">. The Western Shoshone Tribe\u2019s aboriginal title to the lands at issue in this case have long been settled. <em>See United States v. Dann, </em>470 U.S. 39, 41-42, 105 S.Ct. 1058, 84 L.Ed.2d 28 (1985); <em>United States v. Dann, </em>873 F.2d 1189, 1194-1200 (9th Cir. 1989). The United States now holds title to, and BLM now manages, those lands.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
