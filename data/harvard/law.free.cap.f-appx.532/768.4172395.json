This Court has jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253. We review de novo a district court\u2019s decision to deny a petition for a writ of habeas corpus, <em>Moses v. Payne, </em>555 F.3d 742, 750 (9th Cir.2009), and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"769\">*769</page-number>Petitioner argues the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Batson v. Kentucky, </em>476 U.S. 79, 96-98, 106 S.Ct. 1712, 90 L.Ed.2d 69 (1986), forbade the prosecution in his capital murder trial from exercising a peremptory challenge to dismiss a prospective juror on account of that person\u2019s religion. During jury selection, however, Petitioner objected only to the prosecutor\u2019s dismissal of that prospective juror on the basis of race. \u201cThe Supreme Court has never allowed a <em>Batson </em>challenge to be raised on appeal or on collateral attack, if no objection was made during jury selection.\u201d <em>Haney v. Adams, </em>641 F.3d 1168, 1171 (9th Cir.2011). Since Petitioner did not raise a religion-based objection during jury selection, he cannot raise it here. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b795-5\">In any event, Petitioner\u2019s claim fails because the Supreme Court has not extended the protections articulated in <em>Batson </em>to religious affiliation or belief. <em>See, e.g., Davis v. Minnesota, </em>511 U.S. 1115, 114 S.Ct. 2120, 128 L.Ed.2d 679 (1994) (denying certiorari to review state supreme court decision declining to extend <em>Batson </em>to religion); <em>but see J.E.B. v. Alabama, </em>511 U.S. 127, 146, 114 S.Ct. 1419, 128 L.Ed.2d 89 (1994) (extending <em>Batson </em>protections to gender-based peremptory challenges). We may grant an application for habeas corpus only if the underlying state-court decision \u201cwas contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States,\u201d or \u201cwas based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the State court proceeding.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d). As the instant case fails to satisfy either of these statutory requirements, we must deny habeas relief. <em>Moses, </em>555 F.3d at 750.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b794-26\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
