We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review the agency\u2019s factual findings for substantial evidence. <em>Wakkary v. Holder, </em>558 F.3d 1049, 1056 (9th Cir.2009). We deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-24\">Substantial evidence supports the agency\u2019s determination to deny Singh asylum based on a finding that his testimony was not credible. First, Singh gave inconsistent testimony about when and how he joined the political party that was the impetus for his alleged persecution. Further, his testimony regarding his first arrest omitted a serious form of abuse that he described in his asylum application, and his explanation for the omission was implausible. Third, he offered inconsistent evidence as to whether he had to spend several days in a hospital crying in pain as a result of his injuries or just went for treatment at a doctor\u2019s private residence. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"739\">*739</page-number>These inconsistencies support the immigration judge\u2019s adverse credibility determination because they \u201cstrike at the heart of the claim.\u201d <em>See Singh v. Gonzales, </em>439 F.3d 1100, 1105 (9th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b765-5\">Because Singh failed to demonstrate his eligibility for asylum, it follows that he did not satisfy the more stringent standard for withholding of removal. <em>See Farah v. Ashcroft, </em>348 F.3d 1153, 1156 (9th Cir. 2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b765-6\">Finally, because Singh\u2019s CAT claim is based on the same testimony the immigration judge determined was not credible, and Singh did not support his claim with other evidence, he has failed to establish eligibility for CAT relief. <em>See id. </em>at 1156\u2014 57.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-7\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b764-26\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
