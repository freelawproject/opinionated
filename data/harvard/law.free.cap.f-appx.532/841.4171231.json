On appeal, Avila-Carrillo argues that the district court: (1) departed upward without advance notice, in violation of Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 32(h); and (2) imposed a substantively unreasonable sentence. After review, we disagree and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-14\">I. RULE 32(h) NOTICE</p>\n<p id=\"b868-15\">The district court imposed a variance, not an upward departure, and thus it did not violate Rule 32(h).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b868-16\">Rule 32(h) requires the district court to give notice before it imposes a guidelines departure on a ground not identified in the Presentence Investigation Report (\u201cPSI\u201d) or a party\u2019s prehearing submission. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Crim.P. 32(h); <em>see also Burns v. United States, </em>501 U.S. 129, 131, 111 S.Ct. 2182, 2183, 115 L.Ed.2d 123 (1991). However, Rule 32(h)\u2019s notice requirement applies only to departures under the Sentencing Guidelines, not to variances from the applicable guidelines range. <em>Irizarry v. United States, </em>553 U.S. 708, 714-16, 128 S.Ct. 2198, 2202-04, 171 L.Ed.2d 28 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b868-17\">This Court has concluded that an above-guidelines sentence involved a variance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"843\">*843</page-number>from the advisory guidelines range, rather than a departure under the guidelines, when the district court correctly calculated the guidelines range, found that the range did not adequately address all the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors and did not cite a specific departure provision. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Kapordelis, </em>569 F.3d 1291, 1316 (11th Cir.2009); <em>United States v. Irizarry, </em>458 F.3d 1208, 1211-12 (11th Cir.2006), aff'd, 553 U.S. 708, 128 S.Ct. 2198, 171 L.Ed.2d 28 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b869-5\">Here, as stated, the district court imposed a variance, not an upward departure. Specifically, before imposing the 120-month sentence, the district court calculated the advisory guidelines range of 70 to 87 months\u2019 imprisonment. After hearing argument from the parties, the district court stated that it was considering \u201can upward variance\u201d and discussed the \u00a7 3553(a) factors at length. In imposing a sentence above the advisory guidelines range, the district court did not cite to any guidelines departure provision and repeatedly referred to the 120-month sentence as an upward variance. Given that the district court imposed an upward variance, it was not required by Rule 32(h) to provide Avila-Carrillo with advance notice. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Crim.P. 32(h); <em>Irizarry, </em>553 U.S. at 715-16, 128 S.Ct. at 2203-04. Accordingly, Avila-Carrillo has not shown error, much less plain error.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-6\">II. SUBSTANTIVE REASONABLENESS</p>\n<p id=\"b869-7\">We review the reasonableness of a sentence using a \u201cdeferential abuse-of-discretion standard.\u201d <em>Gall v. United States, 552 </em>U.S. 38, 41, 128 S.Ct. 586, 591, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). In a reasonableness review, we first look at whether the district court committed any significant procedural error and then at whether the sentence is substantively unreasonable under the totality of the circumstances and in light of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>United States v. Pugh, </em>515 F.3d 1179, 1190 (11th Cir.2008); <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 788 (11th Cir.2005). The party challenging the sentence has the burden of establishing that the sentence is unreasonable. <em>United States v. Turner, </em>626 F.3d 566, 573 (11th Cir.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b869-9\">Although in choosing a sentence, the district court must consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, the district court is not required to address each factor separately or to state that a particular factor is not applicable. <em>United States v. Bonilla, </em>463 F.3d 1176, 1182 (11th Cir.2006). Rather, an acknowledgement that the district court has considered the defendant\u2019s arguments and the factors generally will suffice. <em>United States v. Scott, </em>426 F.3d 1324, 1329 (11th Cir.2005). Moreover, the weight given to each \u00a7 3553(a) factor is \u201ca matter committed to the sound discretion of the district court.\u201d <em>United States v. Clay, </em>483 F.3d 739, 743 (11th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b869-10\">If the district court decides to impose an upward variance, \u201cit must \u2018consider the extent of the deviation and ensure that the justification is sufficiently compelling to support the degree of the variance.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Williams, </em>526 F.3d 1312, 1322 (11th Cir.2008) (quoting <em>Gall, 552 </em>U.S. at 50, 128 S.Ct. at 597). In reviewing the reasonableness of a sentence outside the advisory guidelines range, we take into account the district court\u2019s justification and the extent of the variance, but we do not require extraordinary circumstances to justify such a sentence or presume that the sentence is unreasonable. <em>Gall, 552 </em>U.S. at 47, 128 S.Ct. at 594-95; <em>United States v. Irey, </em>612 F.3d 1160, 1186-87 (11th Cir.2010) (en banc). We also must give \u201c \u2018due deference to the district court\u2019s decision that the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, on a whole, justify the extent of the variance.\u2019 \u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"844\">*844</page-number><em>Irey, </em>612 F.3d at 1187 (quoting <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 51, 128 S.Ct. at 597). We will vacate such a sentence \u201conly if we are left with the definite and firm conviction that the district court committed a clear error of judgment in weighing the \u00a7 3553(a) factors by arriving at a sentence that lies outside the range of reasonable sentences dictated by the facts of the case.\u201d <em>United States v. Shaw, </em>560 F.3d 1230, 1238 (11th Cir.2009) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b870-4\">Avila-Carrillo has not shown that his above-guideline sentence is substantively unreasonable.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Avila-Carrillo\u2019s contention that the district court failed to consider some of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors is meritless. The district court listened to Avila-Carrillo\u2019s mitigation arguments, including his point that he had already spent thirty months in a county jail in poor conditions and that he would be ineligible for a minimum security prison or other prison benefits due to his immigration status. In fact, the district court stated that Avila-Carrillo\u2019s pretrial detention was likely a \u201chard time\u201d and made it more difficult for him to cooperate. The record also belies Avila-Carrillo\u2019s claim that the district court did not consider the fact that Avila-Carrillo was unlikely to commit further crimes. The district court acknowledged Avila-Carrillo\u2019s low criminal history category of 1. found Avila-Carrillo\u2019s statement of remorse \u201cshowed a lot of insight\u201d and was \u201csincere,\u201d and concluded that \u201cspecific deterrence and protecting the public from further crimes of Mr. Carrillo is a relatively minor consideration.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b870-8\">Further, the district court was not required to specifically discuss each \u00a7 3553(a) factor. <em>See Bonilla, </em>463 F.3d at 1182. In explaining the sentence, the district court stated that it had considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors and discussed in detail a number of them, including the duration and size of the drug conspiracy, Avila-Carrillo\u2019s positive personal characteristics and sincere statement of remorse to the court, the need for the sentence to reflect the seriousness of the offense, the need to provide for general deterrence, and potential disparities between Avila-Carrillo\u2019s sentence and the sentences that several of his co-conspirators received for similar or less serious conduct. The district court\u2019s statements at sentencing were more than sufficient to show it considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>See Scott, </em>426 F.3d at 1329.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-9\">Avila-Carrillo contends that the district court\u2019s reliance on the length and extent of his involvement in the conspiracy was \u201cdouble counting\u201d because the conspiracy was already taken into account in determining his base offense level under the guidelines. However, the district court may consider conduct used to calculate Avila-Carrillo\u2019s advisory guidelines range in deciding whether to impose a variance in light of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>United States v. Amedeo, </em>487 F.3d 823, 833 (11th Cir.2007).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> As to Avila-Carrillo\u2019s argument that the district court gave undue weight to the length and extent of the conspiracy, the district court acted within its discretion in assigning weight to each of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>See Clay, </em>483 F.3d at 743.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"845\">*845</page-number>Finally, the district court provided a sufficiently compelling justification for the 33-month variance by explaining that despite Avila-Carrillo\u2019s positive personal characteristics, substantial assistance and \u201cfavorable guideline treatment,\u201d a longer sentence was necessary because; (1) he was \u201cheavily involved\u201d in a \u201csubstantial drug operation\u201d and was accountable for over 150 kilograms of cocaine; (2) he was also involved in oxycodone trafficking; (3) his co-conspirators, who had been less heavily involved in the conspiracy, had been sentenced to significantly longer terms of imprisonment than Avila-Carrillo faced under the advisory guidelines range; (4) general deterrence was important in this case; and (5) the offense was extremely serious. Accordingly, we affirm Avila-Carrillo\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b868-9\">. Because Avila-Carrillo did not object to the lack of Rule <em>32(h) </em>notice in the district court, we review his claim under the plain error standard. <em>See United States v. Prouty, </em>303 F.3d 1249, 1251-52 (11th Cir.2002). To establish plain error, Avila-Carrillo must show (1) error, (2) that is plain, and (3) that affected his substantial rights. <em>See id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b870-6\">. Avila-Carrillo does not argue that his sentence is procedurally unreasonable.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b870-7\">. There is also no merit to Avila-Carrillo\u2019s claim that the district court impermissibly double counted the conspiracy by using it to set his base offense level and then to \u201cdepart upward.\u2019\u2019 As already explained, the district court did not impose an upward departure under the guidelines, but rather varied from the advisory guidelines range once it was calculated because it was inadequate in light of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
