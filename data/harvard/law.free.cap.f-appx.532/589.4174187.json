After a two-day bench trial, the district court found in favor of Campbell on both theories. Both parties appeal from the district court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-25\">Morrison challenges the district court\u2019s evidentiary rulings on three points. \u201cWe review a district court\u2019s exclusion of evidence for an abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>R.R. Mgmt. Co., L.L.C. v. CFS La. Midstream Co., </em>428 F.3d 214, 217 (5th Cir.2005) (citing <em>Nat\u2019l Hispanic Circus, Inc. v. Rex Trucking, Inc., </em>414 F.3d 546, 551 (5th Cir.2005)). Upon review of the record, the district court acted within its discretion in excluding the evidence at issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-26\">Morrison also raises five issues challenging the district court\u2019s findings with respect to negligence, the vessel\u2019s seaworthiness, and the damages award. We review these district court findings for clear error. <em>See Jauch v. Nautical Sevs., Inc., </em>470 F.3d 207, 213 (5th Cir.2006); <em>Boudreaux v. United States, </em>280 F.3d 461, 468 (5th Cir. 2002). If the district court\u2019s findings are \u25a0 plausible in light of the record as a whole, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>then we will not reverse its judgment, even though we might have weighed the evidence differently sitting as the trier of fact. <em>Bertucci Contracting Corp. v. M/V ANTWERPEN, </em>465 F.3d 254, 258 (5th Cir.2006) (citing <em>Anderson v. Bessemer City, </em>470 U.S. 564, 573-74, 105 S.Ct. 1504, 84 L.Ed.2d 518 (1985)). A finding is clearly erroneous when we are \u201cleft with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 258-59 (quoting <em>Walker v. Braus, </em>995 F.2d 77, 80 (5th Cir.1993)). Having reviewed the briefs, the applicable law, and pertinent portions of the record, we conclude that there is no clear and reversible error in the district court\u2019s findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-4\">Finally, Campbell asserts one issue on cross-appeal, challenging the district court\u2019s finding that calculating his future medical costs for pain medication was too speculative. Campbell, however, has not shown that the district court\u2019s finding was clearly erroneous. <em>See Jauch, </em>470 F.3d at 213.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b615-20\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
