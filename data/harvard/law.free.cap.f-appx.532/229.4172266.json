Though we differ in our reasoning, we will affirm the District Court\u2019s judgment.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b255-26\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-27\">The District Court concluded that White was \u201cseized\u201d for Fourth Amendment purposes upon the officers\u2019 initial approach, but that the officers had reasonable suspicion to stop White based on Davis\u2019s conduct. To its credit, and in the best tradition of government service,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the government now concedes there was no reasonable suspicion to stop White simply because he was walking next to Davis, whom officers reasonably suspected was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>violating the law.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Thus, the remaining issue is whether White was \u201cseized\u201d for Fourth Amendment purposes when the officers initially approached the three men. If that encounter did not amount to a seizure, then the gun need not be suppressed even though the officers had no reason to suspect that White was engaging in unlawful conduct when they initially approached the three men.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-4\">In <em>Terry v. Ohio, </em>the Supreme Court explained that a seizure occurs \u201cwhen the officer, by means of physical force or show of authority, has in some way restrained the liberty of a citizen.\u201d 392 U.S. 1, 19 n. 16, 88 S.Ct. 1868, 20 L.Ed.2d 889 (1968). \u201cAlthough a brief investigatory stop is considered a \u2018seizure,\u2019 not every encounter between the police and a citizen constitutes a seizure within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment.\u201d <em>United States v. Williams, </em>413 F.3d 347, 352 (3d Cir.2005). Where, as here, \u201cthe actions of the police do not show an unambiguous intent to restrain or when an individual\u2019s submission to a show of governmental authority takes the form of passive acquiescence,\u201d we apply an objective test: \u201ca seizure occurs if \u2018in view of all the circumstances surrounding the incident, a reasonable person would have believed that he was not free to leave.\u2019\u201d <em>Brendlin v. California, </em>551 U.S. 249, 255, 127 S.Ct. 2400, 168 L.Ed.2d 132 (2007) (quoting <em>United States v. Mendenhall, </em>446 U.S. 544, 554, 100 S.Ct. 1870, 64 L.Ed.2d 497 (1980)).</p>\n<p id=\"b256-10\">Here, after hearing testimony from Detectives Love and Gault, and defendants White and Davis, the District Court credited the officers\u2019 testimonies and found the defendants\u2019 testimonies not credible. Although the District Court\u2019s findings of fact were not clearly erroneous, the District Court erred in concluding as a matter of law that White was seized when the officers initially approached the three men. Police \u201cdo not violate the Fourth Amendment by merely approaching an individual on the street ... [and] asking him to answer some questions.\u201d <em>Florida v. Royer, </em>460 U.S. 491, 497, 103 S.Ct. 1319, 75 L.Ed.2d 229 (1983); <em>see also Florida v. Bostick, </em>501 U.S. 429, 434, 111 S.Ct. 2382, 115 L.Ed.2d 389 (1991); <em>United States v. Crandell, </em>554 F.3d 79, 85 (3d Cir.2009); <em>Williams, </em>413 F.3d at 354. \u201cNor would the fact that the officer identifies himself as a police officer, without more, convert the encounter into a seizure requiring some level of objective justification.\u201d <em>Royer, </em>460 U.S. at 497, 103 S.Ct. 1319 (citing <em>Mendenhall, </em>446 U.S. at 555, 100 S.Ct. 1870).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Accordingly, without more, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>circumstances here do not constitute a seizure.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b257-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-6\">Viewing the facts in the light most favorable to the government, it is clear under the Supreme Court\u2019s precedent that the earliest White could have been seized was when Detective Love ordered him to remove his hands from his pocket. By then, however, for the reasons stated by the District Court, Detective Love had reasonable suspicion to believe White was armed. Detective Love therefore acted within the limits of <em>Terry </em>in seizing the disputed gun from White.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-7\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-8\">For the reasons we have explained, we will affirm the judgment of the District Court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b255-17\">. The District Court had jurisdiction pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3231. We have appellate jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(a). We review a district court\u2019s denial of a motion to suppress for clear error as to the underlying facts, but exercise plenary review as to legal determinations in light of the court's properly found facts. <em>United States v. Lafferty, </em>503 F.3d 293, 298 (3d Cir.2007). In reviewing the denial of a motion to suppress, we construe the record in the light most favorable to the government. <em>United States v. Harrison, </em>689 F.3d 301, 306 (3d Cir.2012).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b255-29\">. <em>See Berger v. United States, </em>295 U.S. 78, 88, 55 S.Ct. 629, 79 L.Ed. 1314 (1935) (\"The United States Attorney is the representative not of an ordinary party to a controversy, but of a sovereignty whose obligation to govern <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>impartially is as compelling as its obligation to govern at all; and whose interest, therefore, in a criminal prosecution is not that it shall win a case, but that justice shall be done.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b256-6\">. \"The reasonable suspicion required under <em>Terry </em>is specific to the person who is detained. The circumstances \u2018must raise a suspicion that the particular individual being stopped is engaged in wrongdoing.' \u201d <em>United States v. Navedo, </em>694 F.3d 463, 468 (3d Cir.2012) (quoting <em>United States v. Cortez, </em>449 U.S. 411, 418, 101 S.Ct. 690, 66 L.Ed.2d 621 (1981)).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b256-7\">. The government also argues that, pursuant to <em>Brower v. County of Inyo, </em>489 U.S. 593, 109 S.Ct. 1378, 103 L.Ed.2d 628 (1989), White was not seized because officers intended to stop only Davis, and had no intention of stopping White, when they initially approached the three men. This argument is meritless. As explained in <em>Brower </em>itself, \"[a] seizure occurs <em>even when an unintended person </em>or thing is the object of the detention or taking, but the detention or taking itself must be willful.\u201d <em>Brower, </em>489 U.S. at 596, 109 S.Ct. 1378 (emphasis added) (citation omitted). Further, the Supreme Court has since made clear that an intent to detain the defendant is not always necessary for there to be a seizure. <em>See Brendlin, </em>551 U.S. at 259-60, 127 S.Ct. 2400 (rejecting conclusion that passengers in a car were \"not seized by the stop because [the police] only intended to investigate [the driv<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>er] and did not direct a show of authority toward [the passenger]\u201d); <em>Mendenhall, </em>446 U.S. at 554 n. 6, 100 S.Ct. 1870 (\u201d[T]he subjective intention ... to detain the respondent ... is irrelevant except insofar as that may have been conveyed to the respondent.\u201d); <em>Michigan v. Chesternut, </em>486 U.S. 567, 575, n. 7, 108 S.Ct. 1975, 100 L.Ed.2d 565 (1988) (same).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b257-26\">. As this Court has previously expressed, \"[although we have our doubts whether a reasonable person who is greeted by [law enforcement] agents ... feels free to simply ignore the agents, we are not free to substitute our judgment on this question for the Supreme Court\u2019s.\u201d <em>United States v. Thame, </em>846 F.2d 200, 202 (3d Cir.1988).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
