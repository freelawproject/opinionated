He contends that the district court erred by increasing his sentence under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Ll.l(b)(6) based on a finding that he recklessly endangered the aliens by housing them in overcrowded, dangerous, or inhumane conditions.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-20\">We review de novo whether conduct qualifies as reckless endangerment; but we review for clear error the facts underlying that legal conclusion. <em>United, States v. Mata, </em>624 F.3d 170, 173-74 (5th Cir. 2010). The district court was \u201cpermitted to draw reasonable inferences from the facts,\u201d and we review those inferences for clear error. <em>United States v. De JesusOjeda, </em>515 F.3d 434, 442 (5th Cir.2008) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b578-21\">Examples of conduct to which \u00a7 2Ll.l(b)(6) applies include \u201charboring persons in a crowded, dangerous, or inhumane condition.\u201d \u00a7 2L1.1, comment, (n.5) (emphasis added). Trevino does not contend that holding 73 people in a house with a single bathroom was not overcrowding or inhumane. Indeed, he has admitted that the conditions there were \u201cnot acceptable\u201d and \u201cinhumane.\u201d But he argues that the Government was required to prove some additional, specific danger or risk arising from these conditions. However, the examples listed in Application Note 5 under \u00a7 2L1.1 describe situations that pose \u201cinherent\u201d risks of danger. <em>See United States v. Mateo Garza, </em>541 F.3d 290, 293-94 (5th Cir.2008); <em>United States v. Garcia-Guerrero, </em>313 F.3d 892, 896 (5th Cir. 2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b578-22\">The court did not err by finding that the conditions were overcrowded or inhumane, and there was no need to further catalog and prove every possible harm that could have resulted from that inherently dangerous situation. The judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b578-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
