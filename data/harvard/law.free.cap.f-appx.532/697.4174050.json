Dec. 270 (BIA 2002). Relying on <em>Miguel-Miguel v. Gonzales, </em>500 F.3d 941 (9th Cir.2007), Petitioner contends that the retroactive application of <em>Matter of Y-L- </em>was improper. This is a \u201cpure question[ ] of law,\u201d which this Court reviews de novo. <em>See De Martinez v. Ashcroft, </em>374 F.3d 759, 761 (9th Cir.2004). Given that Petitioner\u2019s crime qualified as a particularly serious crime under the law in effect at the time of his guilty plea, we find no error in the BIA\u2019s retroactive application of <em>Matter of Y-L-. See Miguel-Miguel, </em>500 F.3d at 951 (applying factors articulated in <em>Montgomery Ward &amp; Co., Inc. v. FTC, </em>691 F.2d 1322, 1333 (9th Cir.1982)).</p>\n<p id=\"b723-25\">We also conclude that the BIA did not err in denying Petitioner\u2019s application for CAT relief. The factual findings of the Immigration Judge (\u201cIJ\u201d) and the BIA underlying a determination that an applicant is ineligible for CAT relief are reviewed for whether they are supported by substantial evidence. <em>See Arteaga v. Mukasey, </em>511 F.3d 940, 944 (9th Cir.2007). Having reviewed Petitioner\u2019s arguments and the evidence in the record, we conclude that the BIA\u2019s determination is supported by substantial evidence. <em>See Cole v. Holder, </em>659 F.3d 762, 769-70 (9th Cir. 2011). The BIA did not err in relying on <em>Matter of J-F-F- </em>23 I. &amp; N. Dec. 912 (A.G.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b724-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"698\">*698</page-number>Finally, we conclude that the gaps in the transcript of the IJ\u2019s hearing did not violate Petitioner\u2019s due process rights, because the inaccuracies did not prejudice Petitioner. <em>See Cinapian v. Holder, </em>567 F.3d 1067, 1075 (9th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b724-4\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b723-27\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
