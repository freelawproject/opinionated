We have jurisdiction pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252 and deny her petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-26\">\u201cThis court reviews BIA denials of motions to reopen for abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>Iturribarria v. INS, </em>321 F.3d 889, 894 (9th Cir.2003). \u201cThe BIA abuses its discretion when it acts \u2018arbitrarily, irrationally, or contrary to the law.\u2019 \u201d <em>Movsisian v. Ashcroft, </em>395 F.3d 1095, 1098 (9th Cir.2005) (quoting <em>Lainez-Ortiz v. INS, </em>96 F.3d 393, 395 (9th Cir.1996)).</p>\n<p id=\"b765-27\">\u201cGenerally, a party wishing to file a motion to reopen must do so within ninety-days.\u201d <em>Najmabadi v. Holder, </em>597 F.3d 983, 986 (9th Cir.2010) (citing 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2.(c)(2)). \u201cHowever, the ninety-day time limit does not apply where the motion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"740\">*740</page-number>to reopen is \u2018based on changed circumstances arising in the country of nationality or in the country to which deportation has been ordered, if such evidence is material and was not available and could not have been discovered or presented at the previous hearing.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting \u00a7 1003.2(c)(3)(ii)). \u201cThe BIA can deny a motion to reopen on any one of \u2018at least\u2019 three independent grounds \u2014 \u2018[1] failure to establish a prima facie case for the relief sought, [2] failure to introduce previously unavailable, material evidence, and [3] a determination that even if these requirements were satisfied, the movant would not be entitled to the discretionary grant of relief which he sought.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>INS v. Doherty, </em>502 U.S. 314, 323, 112 S.Ct. 719, 116 L.Ed.2d 823 (1992)). \u201cThe Supreme Court has instructed that \u2018[t]he granting of a motion to reopen is ... discretionary, and the Attorney General has \u2018broad discretion\u2019 to grant or deny such motions.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Doherty, </em>502 U.S. at 323, 112 S.Ct. 719).</p>\n<p id=\"b766-4\">Petitioner filed her motion more than ninety days following entry of the final administrative order of removal, but she contends that changed country conditions pertaining to Ethiopia\u2019s treatment of political opponents, combined with changes in her personal circumstances, nonetheless justify reopening her proceedings. We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-5\">The BIA reasonably determined Petitioner\u2019s evidence showed that the Ethiopian government has a long history of mistreating members of the political opposition. Since this information was considered in her original proceedings, it does not give rise to changed circumstances justifying reopening now. Moreover, the BIA considered and reasonably rejected Petitioner\u2019s argument that her recent political activities, which constitute a change in her personal circumstances as opposed to a change in country conditions, warrant reopening. <em>See He v. Gonzales, </em>501 F.3d 1128, 1132 (9th Cir. 2007). Finally, Petitioner offered no evidence that the Ethiopian government is even aware of her support for its political opposition. Petitioner\u2019s petition for review of the BIA\u2019s denial of her motion to reopen is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b765-29\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
