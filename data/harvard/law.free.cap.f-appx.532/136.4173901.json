See 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1415(j). The District Court granted the motion for an injunction. This appeal followed. For the reasons below, we will affirm.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b163-12\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b163-13\">Because we write primarily for the benefit of the parties, we recount only the essential facts. R.B. was born on December 5, 1991 and is diagnosed with Trisomy 21 (Down Syndrome). Based on her diagnosis, R.B. qualified for special education services under the IDEA. From 2005 to 2007, R.B. attended Pickett School within the School District. In 2007, Mastery, a charter school, took over management of Pickett. Since R.B. was already attending Pickett, she automatically became a student of Mastery, and Mastery assumed the responsibility for implementing R.B.\u2019s Individualized Education Plan (\u201cIEP\u201d). The most recent IEP for R.B. was developed in October 2008 (\u201c2008 IEP\u201d). Although not mandated by the 2008 IEP, R.B. received individual support from a Therapeutic Support Staff (\u201cTSS\u201d) during her time at Mastery. The TSS monitored R.B.\u2019s many health issues, assisted her to and from school, helped her transition between classes, and helped with her class work. Ms. Ballard felt that the TSS workers were sometimes unreliable. Indeed, Ms. Ballard would occasionally escort R.B. to class herself and assist her during the day.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-14\">Mastery sought to accommodate R.B.\u2019s needs. Mastery, among other things, modified its attendance policy requirements to oblige R.B.\u2019s health issues. R.B. has physical impairments, including a con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>genital heart condition, a heart murmur, and sleep apnea. These conditions prevented R.B. from consistently waking up in time for school and often required that she miss entire days. Prior to April 2009, Mastery never recorded attendance for R.B., nor did it enforce its truancy policies against her.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-4\">In March 2009, the relationship between Ms. Ballard and Mastery deteriorated. One day, Ms. Ballard brought R.B. to school earlier than usual and was unable to locate R.B.\u2019s classroom. Ms. Ballard refused to sign in and then disrupted a faculty meeting. In response to this incident, Mastery\u2019s principal sent a letter to Ms. Ballard informing her that, in the future, she should make a scheduled appointment in order to enter Mastery. Ms. Ballard interpreted this letter to mean that she was no longer permitted to escort R.B. to class and situate her in the classroom. After receiving the letter, Ms. Ballard stopped bringing R.B. to school.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-5\">The record below indicates that on April 28, 2009, Mastery began marking R.B. absent. On May IS, 2009, Ms. Ballard, on behalf of R.B., filed a complaint (\u201cfirst complaint\u201d) in district court against Mastery and the School District.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> On June 19, 2009, after sending three written communications to R.B.\u2019s mother, Mastery dropped R.B. from its attendance roll. Mastery claims it did so in compliance with \u00a7 11.24 of the Pennsylvania School Code, which mandates that schools dis-enroll students after ten consecutive absences. 22 Pa.Code \u00a7 11.24.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> On August 28, 2009, the first complaint was dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-9\">On October 5, 2010, Appellees filed a Due Process complaint with the Pennsylvania Office for Dispute Resolution against Mastery and the School District. Appellees also sought the issuance of a stay-put order. On November 1, 2010, the Due Process Hearing Officer issued an opinion in which he declined to determine where R.B. would continue her education during the pendency of the proceedings. The Hearing Officer found that he could not determine the appropriate stay-put placement for R.B. until the underlying Due Process complaint had been resolved because \u201cthere was no operative placement [for R.B.] actually functioning at the time this dispute first arose\u201d and Mastery\u2019s disenrohment of R.B. was \u201ca mixed question of fact and law.\u201d (App. at Exhibit A.)</p>\n<p id=\"b164-10\">On November 17, 2010, Appellees appealed the Hearing Officer\u2019s refusal to issue a stay-put order by filing a complaint in District Court. Appellees also filed a motion seeking a mandatory injunction under the IDEA\u2019S \u201cstay-put\u201d provision. 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1415(j). Mastery and the School District filed motions to dismiss the underlying complaint and opposed the request for a mandatory injunction.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-11\">On December SO, 2010, the District Court granted the School District\u2019s motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim because the complaint made no claims against the School District. <em>R.B. ex rel. Parent v. Mastery Charter Sch., </em>762 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>F.Supp.2d 745, 753-54 (E.D.Pa.2010). The District Court then denied both Mastery\u2019s and the School District\u2019s motions to dismiss under Fed. Rule of Civ. P. 12(b)(1); the District Court excused Appellees\u2019 failure to exhaust administrative remedies \u201c \u2018because, given the time-sensitive nature of the IDEA\u2019S stay-put provision, an immediate appeal is necessary to give realistic protection to the claimed right.\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 754-56 (quoting <em>Murphy v. Arlington Cent. Sch. Bd. of Educ., </em>297 F.3d 195, 199 (2d Cir.2002)). The District Court also found that Mastery\u2019s unilateral dis-enrollment of R.B. was a change in placement that 'violated the stay-put provision of the IDEA and ordered that R.B. be immediately re-enrolled at Mastery during the pendency of the administrative proceedings. <em>Id. </em>at 763. The District Court then issued the stay-put injunction. Mastery timely appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-5\">II. JURISDICTION AND STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b165-6\">The District Court had jurisdiction pursuant to 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1415(i)(2)(A). We have appellate jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-7\">Because \u201cthe stay-put provision was intended to serve as a type of \u2018automatic preliminary injunction,\u2019 \u201d <em>Michael C. ex rel. Stephen C. v. Radnor Twp. Sch. Dist., </em>202 F.3d 642, 650 (3d Cir.2000), we will exercise the same standard in reviewing mandatory stay-put injunctions as we do in reviewing preliminary injunctions. \u201c \u201cWe employ a tripartite standard of review for ... preliminary injunctions. We review the District Court\u2019s findings of fact for clear error. Legal conclusions are assessed de novo. The ultimate decision to grant or deny the injunction is reviewed for abuse of discretion.\u2019 \u201d <em>K.A. ex rel. Ayers v. Pocono Mountain Sch. Dist., </em>710 F.3d 99, 105 (3d Cir.2013) (alteration in original) (quoting <em>Sypniewski v. Warren Hills Reg\u2019l Bd. of Educ., </em>307 F.3d 243, 252 (3d Cir.2002)).</p>\n<p id=\"b165-9\">III. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b165-10\">Mastery\u2019s arguments are essentially two-fold. First, Mastery argues that the District Court erred by concluding that the dis-enrollment of R.B. was a \u201cchange in placement\u201d that violated the stay-put provision. Second, Mastery argues that the District Court erred when it found that Pennsylvania state law mandating the dis-enrollment of students following ten consecutive absences was preempted by the IDEA under the Supremacy Clause of the Constitution. We address each argument in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-11\">A. <em>Change in Placement</em></p>\n<p id=\"b165-12\">Mastery first argues that R.B.\u2019s dis-enrollment from Mastery does not constitute a change in placement that would violate the stay-put provision. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-13\">Section 614 of the IDEA, codified at 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1415(j), provides that \u201cduring the pendency of any proceedings conducted pursuant to this section, unless the State or local educational agency and the parents otherwise agree, the child shall remain in the then-current educational placement of the child.\u201d \u201cTh[is] provision represents Congress\u2019 policy choice that all handicapped children, regardless of whether their case is meritorious or not, are to remain in their current educational placement until the dispute with regard to their placement is ultimately resolved.\u201d <em>Drinker ex rel. Drinker v. Colonial Sch. Dist., </em>78 F.3d 859, 864 (3d Cir.1996) (internal quotation marks omitted). The stay-put provision \u201cprotects the status quo of a child\u2019s educational placement,\u201d <em>C.H. ex rel. Hayes v. Cape Henlopen Sch. Dist., </em>606 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>F.3d 59, 72 (3d Cir.2010), by preventing \u201cschool districts from effecting unilateral change in a child\u2019s educational program,\u201d <em>Susquenita Sch. Dist. v. Rodee S. ex rel. Heidi S., </em>96 F.3d 78, 83 (3d Cir.1996). <em>See also Jackson ex rel. Thompson v. Franklin Cnty. Sch. Bd., </em>765 F.2d 535, 538 (5th Cir.1985) (\u201cThe directive of [the stay-put provision] is clear; it is designed to preserve the status quo pending resolution of administrative and judicial proceedings .... \u201d), <em>abrogated on other grounds by Honig v. Doe, </em>484 U.S. 305, 108 S.Ct. 592, 98 L.Ed.2d 686 (1988). A parent may invoke the stay-put provision when a school proposes a change in the child\u2019s \u201cthen-current educational placement.\u201d <em>See </em>20 U.S.C. 1415(j). The relevant inquiry under \u00a7 1415\u00a9 thus becomes the identification of the child\u2019s \u201cthen-current educational placement.\u201d <em>See Drinker, </em>78 F.3d at 865 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b166-4\">We look to a student\u2019s existing IEP to determine a child\u2019s \u201cthen-current educational placement\u201d (or the \u201cstatus quo\u201d) and whether a school has implemented a change from that IEP. \u201cIf an IEP has been implemented, then that program\u2019s placement will be the one subject to the stay[-]put provision.\u201d <em>Drinker, </em>78 F.3d at 867 (internal quotation marks omitted); <em>see also Michael C., </em>202 F.3d at 650 (looking to the student\u2019s \u201cexisting IEP\u201d to determine the limitations of the stay-put provision on the school\u2019s authority to unilaterally affect changes). The educational placement is thus defined as the IEP \u201cactually functioning when the stay-put is invoked.\u201d <em>Drinker, </em>78 F.3d at 867 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b166-5\">Here, R.B.\u2019s most current IEP is from October 2008. This 2008 IEP unequivocally provides that R.B.\u2019s Local Education Agency (\u201cLEA\u201d) is Mastery Charter School and that the IEP will be implemented at Mastery. Moreover, Mastery admits that the 2008 IEP is the \u201clast-agreed-upon program\u201d and that this IEP mandates R.B.\u2019s placement at Mastery. Def.\u2019s Mem. of Law in Opp\u2019n to Mot. for Prelim. Inj. at 7-8, No. 10-cv-6722, (E.D.Pa. Nov. 22, 2010), ECF No. 5. Because R.B.\u2019s IEP designates Mastery as her LEA, any decision by the school to remove R.B. from Mastery is contrary to her existing IEP, constitutes a change in placement, and thus, violates the stay-put provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-7\">Mastery attempts to side-step the mandates of the stay-put provision by arguing that, since R.B. was dis-enrolled from Mastery on June 19, 2009, prior to the filing of the Due Process complaint on October 5, 2010, there were no \u201cproceedings\u201d pending and the dis-enrollment does not violate the stay-put provision. Essentially, Mastery is arguing that the \u201cstatus quo\u201d the stay-put provision seeks to maintain is the current state of affairs at the time of the filing of a complaint. Because Mastery dis-enrolled R.B. prior to the filing of the complaint, Mastery claims that R.B.\u2019s LEA is not Mastery, but is the school district of her residence.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-8\">This argument is without merit. As noted earlier, the \u201cstatus quo\u201d is determined by the existing IEP. All parties agree that the 2008 IEP is the most current IEP, and the 2008 IEP clearly states that R.B.\u2019s LEA is Mastery Charter School. As such, R.B.\u2019s placement at Mastery is the \u201cstatus quo\u201d that is to be maintained through the stay-put provision. To hold otherwise would render the stay-put provision useless, as schools could implement unilateral changes prior to a parent\u2019s suit and then claim that the new change is the status quo. This cannot be.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-9\">In <em>Honig v. Doe, </em>the Supreme Court held that a school\u2019s decision to expel students for violent behavior violated the stay-put provision. 484 U.S. 305, 323, 108 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>S.Ct. 592, 98 L.Ed.2d 686 (1988). In doing so, the Supreme Court was unequivocal that the stay-put provision reflected Congress\u2019s intent \u201cto strip schools of the <em>unilateral </em>authority they had traditionally employed to exclude disabled students.\u201d <em>Id.; see also Cronin v. Bd. of Educ. of East Ramapo Cent. Sch. Dist., </em>689 F.Supp. 197, 203 (S.D.N.Y.1988) (relying on <em>Honig </em>to hold that the school district\u2019s unilateral decision to graduate a disabled student over the objection of his parents constituted a change in placement and violated the stay-put provision). In the same vein, we now find that Mastery\u2019s unilateral dis-enrollment of R.B. violates the stay-put provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-5\">We are unmoved by Mastery\u2019s argument that the stay-put provision requires only the maintenance of a \u201cstudent\u2019s educational program and not the particular building where the program is implemented.\u201d (Appellant\u2019s Br. 16.) Mastery is correct that the stay-put provision \u201cis not construed so narrowly as to mandate the student remain in the exact physical location where he or she was schooled at the time the dispute arose.\u201d <em>George A. v. Wallingford Swarthmore Sch. Dist., </em>655 F.Supp.2d 546, 550 (E.D.Pa.2009). However, we have never permitted schools to make changes that \u201cmay have a significant effect on a child\u2019s learning experience.\u201d <em>DeLeon v. Susquehanna Cmty. Sch. Dist., </em>747 F.2d 149, 154 (3d Cir.1984) (holding that modifications to the method of transportation to and from school did not constitute a change in placement that would violate the stay-put provision). There is no question that the unilateral removal of R.B. from Mastery will significantly affect R.B.\u2019s learning experience.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b167-8\">B. <em>Preemption</em></p>\n<p id=\"b167-9\">Mastery next argues that the District Court erred when it found that Mastery had unilaterally dis-enrolled R.B. Mastery contends that it was required to dis-enroll R.B. to comply with \u00a7 11.24 of the Pennsylvania School Code, which mandates that schools dis-enroll students after ten consecutive absences. 22 Pa.Code \u00a7 11.24. As an initial matter, in light of the evidence presented at the proceedings below, we cannot say that the District Court clearly erred in finding that Mastery unilaterally dis-enrolled R.B. <em>See K.A., </em>710 F.3d at 105 (noting that a district court\u2019s findings of fact with regard to preliminary injunctions are reviewed for clear error); <em>see also Anderson v. City of Bessemer City, </em>470 U.S. 564, 573-74, 105 S.Ct. 1504, 84 L.Ed.2d 518 (1985) (explaining that under the highly deferential \u201cclear error\u201d standard, a district court\u2019s findings of fact may only be overturned if the finding is not \u201cplausible in light of the record viewed in its entirety\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b167-10\">Ultimately, however, Mastery\u2019s purported reason for dis-enrolling R.B. is irrele<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>vant because we agree with the District Court that Pennsylvania\u2019s mandatory attendance laws are preempted by IDEA\u2019S stay-put provision. Mastery argues that federal preemption cannot apply here because the IDEA is \u201csilent concerning [mandatory school] attendance, and therefore, defers to the individual states relative to compulsory attendance statutes.\u201d (Appellant\u2019s Br. 21.) Federal preemption is not so constrictive.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-4\">Under the doctrine of federal preemption, which is rooted in the Supremacy Clause of the Constitution of the United States, state laws are invalid if they \u201c \u2018interfere with, or are contrary to, federal law.\u2019 \u201d <em>Fellner v. Tri-Union Seafoods, L.L.C., </em>539 F.3d 237, 242 (3d Cir.2008) (quoting <em>Hillsborough Cnty. v. Automated Med. Labs., </em>471 U.S. 707, 712, 105 S.Ct. 2371, 85 L.Ed.2d 714 (1985)). \u201cThere are three types of preemption: express preemption and two types of implied preemption, field preemption and conflict preemption.\u201d <em>Treasurer of N.J. v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Treasury, </em>684 F.3d 382, 406 (3d Cir.2012). Conflict preemption is found where \u201ccompliance with both federal and state regulations is a physical impossibility,\u201d <em>Fla. Lime &amp; Avocado Growers, Inc. v. Paul, </em>373 U.S. 132, 142-43, 83 S.Ct. 1210, 10 L.Ed.2d 248 (1963), or where state law erects an \u201cobstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of Congress,\u201d <em>Farina v. Nokia Inc., </em>625 F.3d 97, 115 (3d Cir.2010) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b168-5\">Here, conflict preemption applies. It is impossible for Mastery to comply with the requirements of \u00a7 11.24 of the Pennsylvania School Code, while simultaneously complying with the stay-put provision; Mastery cannot remove R.B. from its attendance roll and implement her IEP at the same time. Under the preemption doctrine, the stay-put provision prevails. <em>See Doe ex rel. Gonzales v. Maher, </em>793 F.2d 1470, 1485-86 (9th Cir.1986) (holding that the stay-put provision of the Education for All Handicapped Children\u2019s Act (\u201cEHA\u201d)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> preempted state law allowing the indefinite suspension or expulsion of a disabled student during administrative proceedings); <em>E.Z.-L. ex rel. R.L. v. NYC Dep\u2019t of Educ., </em>763 F.Supp.2d 584, 599 (S.D.N.Y.2011) (holding that the stay-put provision preempted state law regarding unjust enrichment).</p>\n<p id=\"b168-8\">IV. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b168-9\">We find no error in the District Court\u2019s factual or legal conclusions. The District Court did not abuse its discretion in granting the stay-put injunction. We will affirm the District Court\u2019s Order.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b163-11\">. At the time that Mastery filed the notice of appeal on January 6, 2011, R.B. was represented by counsel. On September 8, 2011, we granted R.B.'s counsel's request to withdraw. Ms. Ballard is not permitted to represent R.B. because parents may not represent their children in IDEA cases in federal court. <em>See Osei-Afriyie v. Med. Coll. of Pa., </em>937 F.2d 876, 878 (3d Cir.1991). Thus, R.B. is currently unrepresented. This does not prevent us from hearing this appeal. <em>See Ray v. Robinson, </em>640 F.2d 474, 476 (3d Cir.1981) (reaching the merits of the appeal despite appellee\u2019s refusal to participate); <em>see also United States v. Everett, </em>700 F.2d 900, 902 (3d Cir.1983) (finding that the court may \"decide the case on the brief of the appellant only\u201d if appellee fails to file a brief). Additionally, given that we will affirm, concerns regarding safeguarding R.B.\u2019s rights are not as pronounced as they might otherwise be. See <em>Osei-Afriyie, </em>937 F.2d at 883 (\"Where [children] have claims that require adjudication, they are entitled to trained legal assistance so their rights may be fully protected.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b164-6\">. The first complaint alleged a \"violation of [R.B.\u2019s] civil rights, as well as pattern and practice discrimination, breach of contract, [p]eijury, fraud, defamation of character, violation of FAPE, violation of HIPPA privacy policy, slander and conspiracy.\u201d Compl. at 1, <em>Ballard v. Sch. Dist. of Phila., </em>No. 09-1627 (E.D.Pa. May 13, 2009), ECF No. 3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b164-12\">. Section 11.24 provides: \"Students whose names are on the active membership roll, who are at anytime in the school term absent from school for 10 consecutive school days, shall thereafter be removed from the active membership roll unless one of the following occurs: (1) The district has been provided with evidence that absence may be legally excused. (2) Compulsory attendance prosecution has been or is being pursued.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b167-6\">. Mastery also cites <em>Concerned Parents v. N.Y.C. Bd. of Educ., </em>629 F.2d 751 (2d Cir. 1980), and <em>Tilton ex rel. Richards v. Jefferson Cnty. Bd. of Educ., </em>705 F.2d 800 (6th Cir. 1983), in support of its argument that the transfer of a disabled student to a new school within the same district does not violate the stay-put provision. Mastery's reliance on these two cases is misplaced. As we previously explained, these two cases \"involve an entirely different problem: whether a decision concerning the closing of a facility, which by definition involves ... a substantial fiscal policy question for the school district, should be outside the [requirements of the stay-put provision.]\u201d <em>DeLeon, </em>747 F.2d at 153. More to the point, Mastery may not skirt its responsibility toward R.B. merely because R.B. has the option of continuing her education at another high school within the School District of Philadelphia. The relevant inquiry is not whether a child has educational options outside of her current placement, but whether forcing a child to utilize those options will significantly affect the child\u2019s learning experience. <em>See id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b168-6\">.
