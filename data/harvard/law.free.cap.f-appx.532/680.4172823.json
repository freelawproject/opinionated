Ebel, Senior Circuit Judge for the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b706-24\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b706-25\">Petitioner-Appellant Cecil Paul Tasby (Tasby) challenges the district court\u2019s denial of his habeas petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-26\">1. We express hesitation over whether Tasb/s petition fairly presented his federal claims to the Washington Supreme Court. A habeas petition must reference specific federal guarantees and state facts underlying the claims. <em>See Gentry v. Sin</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"681\">*681</page-number><em>clair, </em>705 F.3d 884, 897 (9th Cir.2013). A federal claim may be \u201craised in the petition itself, an accompanying brief, or another similar document filed with that court.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citations and internal quotation marks omitted).'</p>\n<p id=\"b707-5\">Tasby\u2019s petition states four federal claims: \u201c(1) Ineffective Assistance of Counsel; (2) Prosecutorial Misconduct; (3) Rules of Evidence; [and] (4) Federal Confrontation Clause,\u201d but relies on the attached Washington Court of Appeal\u2019s opinion to state the facts underlying his claims. Although <em>pro se </em>petitions are \u201cheld to a more lenient standard than counseled petitions,\u201d <em>Davis v. Silva, </em>511 F.3d 1005, 1009 (9th Cir.2008), we nevertheless harbor doubt over whether attaching a state court decision to a petition suffices to fairly present facts underlying a petitioner\u2019s federal claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-7\">2. Notwithstanding exhaustion, the state court did not unreasonably conclude that the prosecutor\u2019s misconduct constituted harmless error. While the prosecutor improperly cross-examined Tasby on the veracity of some of the state\u2019s witnesses, Tasby\u2019s conviction rested on a plethora of other evidence. <em>See United States v. Moreland, </em>622 F.3d 1147, 1160-61 (9th Cir.2010) (improper cross-examination was harmless given the numerous other witnesses who bolstered the government\u2019s case). Similarly, although the prosecutor improperly vouched for Cherity Phelps\u2019s veracity, the misconduct did not materially affect the fairness of Tasby\u2019s trial because Phelps\u2019s testimony was not critical to the state\u2019s case. <em>See United States v. Stinson, </em>647 F.3d 1196, 1212-13 (9th Cir.2011) (holding that vouching was harmless error given the significance of the government\u2019s other evidence).</p>\n<p id=\"b707-8\">Nor did the state court unreasonably characterize as \u201cnot improper\u201d the prosecutor\u2019s comments about a missing witness. <em>See United States v. Necoechea, </em>986 F.2d 1273, 1282 (9th Cir.1993) (\u201cA prosecutor is entitled to comment on a defendant\u2019s failure to present witnesses so long as it is not phrased to call attention to the defendant\u2019s own failure to testify----\u201d) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b707-11\">Finally, the state court\u2019s conclusion was reasonable that the prosecutor did not impermissibly comment on Tasby\u2019s right to remain silent. <em>See United States v. Williams, </em>990 F.2d 507, 510 (9th Cir.1993) (holding that defendant\u2019s \u201cright not to testify was not implicated because he did in fact testify at trial\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b707-12\">3. The state court did not unreasonably conclude that the Confrontation Clause violation was harmless. Detective Burbridge\u2019s testimony that Tasby\u2019s pretrial counsel confirmed the veracity of the detective\u2019s report was testimonial hearsay, but it merely corroborated the detective\u2019s own recollection of Tasby\u2019s admission. Other circumstantial evidence also suggested that Tasby knew that Ramey had informed the police of his involvement in the robbery. Accordingly, the Confrontation Clause violation was harmless because it did not implicate the verdict. <em>See Merolillo v. Yates, </em>663 F.3d 444, 454 (9th Cir. 2011) (\u201cHabeas relief is warranted only if the [constitutional] error had a substantial and injurious effect or influence in determining the jury\u2019s verdict.... \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b707-13\">4. The state court did not unreasonably apply <em>Strickland </em>in denying Tasby\u2019s IAC claim. Because the prosecutorial misconduct and Confrontation Clause violation were harmless errors, the failure of Tasby\u2019s counsel to object to these violations did not cause prejudice. <em>See Carrera v. Ayers, </em>699 F.3d 1104, 1111 (9th Cir.2012) (denying habeas relief where defendant failed to establish that counsel\u2019s failure to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"682\">*682</page-number>object to the prosecutor\u2019s peremptory strikes caused prejudice).</p>\n<p id=\"b708-4\">5. Tasby failed to exhaust his cumulative error claim, as the district court neither considered nor certified the claim, and it was not set forth in his petition to the Washington Supreme Court. <em>See Wooten v. Kirkland, </em>540 F.3d 1019, 1026 (9th Cir. 2008) (district court properly denied habeas petition where petitioner failed to exhaust his cumulative error claim).</p>\n<p id=\"b708-5\">Nevertheless, given the overwhelming evidence underlying Tasby\u2019s convictions, the prosecutorial misconduct, coupled with the Confrontation Clause violation, do not amount to a due process violation. <em>Cf. Parle v. Runnels, </em>505 F.3d 922, 930 (9th Cir.2007) (noting that habeas relief was warranted because cumulative error of individual constitutional errors significantly compromised the defense).</p>\n<p id=\"b708-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b706-27\"><em> </em>This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
