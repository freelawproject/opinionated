For the reasons that follow, we will summarily affirm. <em>See </em>LAR 27.4; I.O.P. 10.6.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-27\">We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. Our jurisdiction includes review of final decisions of the district courts. <em>See In re Grand Jury, </em>705 F.3d 133, 142 (3d Cir.2012). \u201cWhether a decision is final depends on its effects. Ordinarily, a final decision will have two effects. First, the decision will fully resolve all claims presented to the district court. Second, after the decision has been issued, there will be nothing further for the district court to do.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citations and internal quotation marks omitted). Here, the order appealed conclusively determined Harris\u2019s right to a reduction of sentence under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b132-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>Though Harris titled his motion as one for reconsideration, in effect it was a second motion to reduce his sentence on a different basis than his prior \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion. As such, we exercise plenary review over the District Court\u2019s decision that Harris is ineligible for relief under \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>United States v. Savani, </em>Nos. 11-4359, 11-4494 &amp; 12-1034, 733 F.3d 56, 60-61, 2013 WL 2462941, at *4 (3d Cir. June 10, 2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b132-4\">Congress has limited the ability of district courts to modify a sentence once imposed. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 3582(c)(2) provides a narrow ground on which a modification can be ordered when 1) the defendant\u2019s sentence was based on a guideline range that has since been lowered by the United States Sentencing Commission (USSC) and 2) the reduction in sentence is consistent with the USSC\u2019s policy statements. <em>Id. </em>Harris has attempted to challenge his sentence in light of the Fair Sentencing Act of 2010(FSA), Pub.L. No. 11-220, 123 Stat. 2372 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b132-5\">Harris\u2019s challenge must fail. Harris was convicted and sentenced prior to FSA\u2019s passage, and it does not apply retroactively to him. <em>See United States v. Turlington, </em>696 F.3d 425, 428 (3d Cir. 2012). Harris believes that a recent, split panel decision in the Sixth Circuit provides a basis for his challenge. <em>See United States v. Blewett, </em>719 F.3d 482, 490-91 (6th Cir.2013) (holding FSA is completely retroactive). Whatever the merits of that decision, its holding is completely foreclosed by this Court\u2019s binding precedent in <em>Turlington. See Turlington, </em>696 F.3d at 428 (discussing continuing validity of <em>United States v. Reevey, </em>631 F.3d 110, 115 (3d Cir.2010), which held that FSA does not apply retroactively to defendants sentenced prior to its passage).</p>\n<p id=\"b132-7\">For the reasons given, we will summarily affirm the judgment of the District Court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b132-17\">. The District Court denied Harris\u2019s motion in part on the basis that the claim Harris was asserting was within the realm of habeas, and invited (but did not order) Harris to refile it as a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion or potentially as a petition under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241. The District Court went so far as to direct the clerk to mail Harris a blank form to accommodate his refiling. Harris has not done so yet, and nothing remains pending in this case. While the order does contain language to the effect that Harris\u2019s motion <em>is </em>a \u00a7 2255 motion, we believe that the District Court's denial of the \"motion\u201d suggests more strongly that the District Court has ruled Harris is ineligible for relief under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) on the basis asserted.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
