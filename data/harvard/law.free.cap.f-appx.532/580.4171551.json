In December 2005, Wardell was convicted following a jury trial of conspiracy to retaliate against a witness and retaliation against a witness and aiding and abetting and was sentenced to a 115-month term of imprisonment, a total three-year term of supervised release, and $1,041 in restitution. Wardell appeals the district court\u2019s denial of his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 habeas corpus petition in which he alleged that (1) he was being forced to pay 50 percent of his monthly prison wages toward the payment of restitution through the Inmate Financial Responsibility Program (IFRP) in accordance with the Mandatory Victim Restitution Act, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3663A, 3664; (2) only the district court had the authority to set a restitution payment schedule; (3) the authority could not be delegated to the Bureau of Prisons (BOP); and (4) because the district court did not set a payment schedule, he was under no obligation to follow the BOP\u2019s forced payment scheme. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>Wardell reasserts these arguments in this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-5\">A challenge to a restitution payment schedule set by the BOP pursuant to the IFRP is properly raised in a \u00a7 2241 petition because it is a challenge to a BOP administrative program and not to any action by the district court. <em>See United States v. Diggs, 578 </em>F.3d 318, 319-20 <em>&amp; </em>n. 1 (5th Cir.2009). In an appeal from the denial of habeas relief, we review the district court\u2019s factual findings for clear error and issues of law de novo. <em>Jeffers v. Chandler, </em>253 F.3d 827, 830 (5th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b607-6\">The district court\u2019s restitution orders required that restitution was to be paid \u201cimmediately\u201d and thus were in accord with 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3572(d)(1), which requires immediate payment of monetary penalties, including restitution, unless, \u201cin the interest of justice, the court provides for payment ... in installments.\u201d \u201c \u2018Immediate\u2019 payment orders have been construed to authorize BOP to place inmates in the IFRP to facilitate payment, notwithstanding that their judgments also provided for post-imprisonment installments.\u201d <em>Hickman v. Keffer, </em>498 Fed.Appx. 375, 378-79 (5th Cir. 2012). The BOP did not violate the district court\u2019s restitution orders by placing Wardell in the IFRP, and the restitution orders, which determined the amount of restitution and ordered immediate payment, did not constitute \u201can unconstitutional delegation of judicial authority.\u201d <em>Kaemmerling v. Berkebile, </em>359 Fed.Appx. 545, 546-47 (5th Cir.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b607-7\">To the extent that Wardell argues that the district court erred in requiring that he demonstrate a constitutional violation because \u00a7 2241 was the appropriate vehicle for his challenge, he is correct that \u00a7 2241 was the appropriate vehicle. <em>See Diggs, </em>578 F.3d at 319-20 &amp; n. 1. However, Wardell was not entitled to federal habeas relief unless he demonstrated that he was deprived of some right secured to him by the laws of the United States or by the United States Constitution, a showing he did not make. See <em>Malchi v. Thaler, </em>211 F.3d 953, 957 (5th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b607-9\">Wardell argues, for the first time on appeal, that the sentencing court in imposing restitution erred in failing to consider his ability to pay. We will not consider Wardell\u2019s newly raised claim. <em>See Wilson v. Roy, </em>643 F.3d 433, 435 n. 1 (5th Cir. 2011), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 132 S.Ct. 1062, 181 L.Ed.2d 779 (2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b607-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b606-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
