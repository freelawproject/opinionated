No. 105-100, 110 Stat. 2160 (1997), <em>as amended by </em>Pub. L. No. 105-139, 111 Stat. 2644 (1997). Villeda previously pled <em>nolo contendere </em>in Florida state court to willfully failing to stop and remain at the scene of an accident involving death under \u00a7 316.027(l)(b) of the Florida Statutes. Using the modified categorical approach, the BIA determined this conviction constituted a crime involving moral turpitude, and that Villeda was ineligible for relief under NACARA because he had not established a continuous period of at least ten years of residence following his conviction. Villeda argues before this Court that the BIA considered portions of the record relying on impermissible evidence to determine that his conviction qualified as a crime involving moral turpitude.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b923-20\">We review only the BIA\u2019s decision, except to the extent it expressly adopts the IJ\u2019s opinion. <em>Al Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1284 (11th Cir.2001). Here, because the BIA issued its own decision, we review the BIA\u2019s decision. <em>See id. </em>We review the BIA\u2019s legal determinations <em>de novo, Maldonado v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>664 F.3d 1369, 1375 (11th Cir.2011), but give deference to the BIA\u2019s interpretation of the statutes it administers, <em>De la Rosa v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>579 F.3d 1327, 1335 (11th Cir .2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b923-21\">Although \u201cmoral turpitude\u201d is not defined by the immigration statute, this Court has recognized that it involves \u201c[a]n act of baseness, vileness, or depravity in the private and social duties which a man <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"898\">*898</page-number>owes to his fellow men, or to society in general, contrary to the accepted and customary rule of right and duty between man and man.\u201d <em>Itani v. Ashcroft, </em>298 F.3d 1213, 1215 (11th Cir.2002). We use the categorical approach to determine whether a particular offense constitutes a crime involving moral turpitude. <em>Fajardo v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>659 F.3d 1303, 1305 (11th Cir.2011). However, if the statutory language \u201cencompasses some conduct that categorically would be grounds for removal as well as other conduct that would not,\u201d then adjudicators may use the modified categorical approach and look at \u201cthe record of conviction \u2014 i.e., the charging document, plea, verdict, and sentence.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b924-4\">Under \u00a7 316.027(l)(b) of the Florida Statutes, a driver of a vehicle involved in an accident that results in the death of any person must immediately stop at the scene and remain at the scene until he has fulfilled the requirements of \u00a7 316.062, which requires, <em>inter alia, </em>the driver of the vehicle to provide certain information and render \u201creasonable assistance\u201d to any person injured in the crash. Fla. Stat. \u00a7 316.062(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b924-5\">The parties agree that the BIA properly determined that the statute is divisible, such that use of the modified categorical approach was appropriate. In finding that Villeda was convicted of a crime involving moral turpitude, the BIA relied on the charging document, which stated that Villeda \u201cunlawfully and willfully fail[ed] to stop the vehicle at the scene of said crash ... and remain at the scene of the crash until fulfilling the requirements of Section 316.062, said crash resulting in the death of [the victim] contrary to Section 316.027(l)(b).\u201d The BIA\u2019s reliance on the charging document was proper under the modified categorical approach, <em>Fajardo, </em>659 F.3d at 1305, and, contrary to Villeda\u2019s assertion, the BIA\u2019s determination was not affected by his arrest report or any other impermissible evidence. Based on the record of conviction, we agree with the BIA\u2019s conclusion that Villeda\u2019s willful failure to stop and remain at the scene of the deadly crash was inherently base, vile, or depraved, and \u201ccontrary to the accepted and customary rule of right and duty between man and man.\u201d <em>Itani, </em>298 F.3d at 1215. And, because Villeda could not establish ten years of continuous physical presence in the United States following the conviction, the BIA did not err by finding him ineligible for special rule cancellation of removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b924-7\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b923-18\">. Villeda also contends the term \"crime involving moral turpitude\u201d is vague and lacks clarity, and we should conclude it is void as applied to \u00a7 316.027(l)(b). This argument is without merit. <em>See, e.g., Jordan v. De George, </em>341 U.S. 223, 229-30, 71 S.Ct. 703, 95 L.Ed. 886 (1951) (noting that the phrase \"crime involving moral turpitude\u201d has \"been part of the immigration laws for more than sixty years\u201d and \"used for many years as a criterion in a variety of other statutes,\u201d and \"[n]o case has been decided holding that the phrase is vague\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
