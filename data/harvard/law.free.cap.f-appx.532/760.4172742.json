Accordingly, the court\u2019s imposition of sentencing enhancements was appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-23\">Martin\u2019s argument that his offenses should have been grouped pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3Dl.l(a)(l) because they arose from one common scheme is wrong. His scheme involved multiple victims. Therefore, grouping is not appropriate. Martin\u2019s arguments based on out-of-circuit precedent are inapposite.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-24\">Finally, contrary to his argument, Martin\u2019s 87-month sentence was substantively reasonable when measured against the aggressive and extortionate dimensions of his criminal conduct plus his past history.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-25\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b786-36\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
