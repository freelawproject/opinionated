We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-7\">1. The district court did not plainly err in failing to expressly consider U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.3, a policy statement concerning \u201cdepartures based on inadequacy of criminal history.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> It is not clear that \u00a7 4A1.3 is a \u201cpertinent policy statement\u201d that the district court was required to consider under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(5). Unlike the out-of-circuit cases that Lopez cites, <em>United States v. Hodge, </em>469 F.3d 749 (8th Cir.2006), and <em>United States v. Engle, </em>592 F.3d 495 (4th Cir.2010), the district court\u2019s upward variance was not directly contrary to \u00a7 4A1.3. The sentencing transcript indicates that the district court varied upwards not because he thought Lopez\u2019s criminal history category underrepresented the seriousness of his criminal history, but primarily because Lopez\u2019s prior 27-month sentence failed to deter him from committing the same offense six weeks after being released from prison. Therefore, the district court did not plainly commit procedural error.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-8\">2. The district court did not abuse its discretion in sentencing Lopez to an</p>\n<p id=\"b800-11\">above-Guidelines, 36-month term of imprisonment. <em>See Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 41, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007) (\u201c[Cjourts of appeal must review all sentences \u2014 whether inside, just outside, or significantly outside the Guidelines range \u2014 under a deferential abuse-of-discretion standard.\u201d); <em>United States v. Ressam, </em>679 F.3d 1069, 1088 (9th Cir.2012) (en banc) (\u201c[Rjeview of the substantive reasonableness of a sentence is deferential and will provide relief only in rare cases.\u201d). The district court\u2019s conclusion that deterrence should be given significant weight is entitled to deference, <em>see United States v. Gutierrez-Sanchez, </em>587 F.3d 904, 908 (9th Cir.2009), as is the district court\u2019s assessment that the <em>length </em>of Lopez\u2019s prior 27-month sentence (regardless of its alleged flaws) did not adequately deter him from committing the same crime only six weeks after being released from prison. <em>See, e.g., id. </em>at 908 (upholding as reasonable the district court\u2019s sentence in light of the defendant\u2019s repeated immigration violations and the district court\u2019s statement that he was imposing a severe sentence that would properly inform the defendant not to return to the United States); <em>cf., United States v. Segura-Del Real, </em>83 F.3d 275, 277-78 (9th Cir.1996) (upholding upward departure in light of repetitive immigration violations, which demonstrated defendant\u2019s lack of recognition of the gravity of such offenses and his propensity to continue committing them).</p>\n<p id=\"b800-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b800-9\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir. R. 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b800-10\">. We reject Lopez\u2019s argument that plain error review does not apply. Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 51(b) is inapplicable where, as here, the district court offered numerous opportunities during the sentencing hearing for Lopez to raise the issue he now appeals.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
