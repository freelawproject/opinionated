We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"748\">*748</page-number>I</p>\n<p id=\"b774-4\">Dimas challenges the admission of Deputy Sheriff Cary Colla\u2019s expert testimony that a trained drug-sniffing dog detected the presence of narcotics in Dimas\u2019s vehicle. Dimas argues that Colla\u2019s testimony was unreliable and that his comments about lingering narcotics odors went beyond the scope of his expertise. We review a district court\u2019s decision to admit expert testimony for an abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Alatorre, 222 </em>F.3d 1098, 1100 (9th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b774-5\">Deputy Colla\u2019s experience and training provided a reliable foundation for his testimony about narcotics odors and the dog\u2019s search of Dimas\u2019s vehicle. Both Colla and the dog were certified in drug detection, and they trained together on a monthly basis. The dog was 100% accurate in his testing. Further, Colla attended conferences and classes relating to his duties as a drug dog handler. Accordingly, the district court did not abuse its discretion by admitting Colla\u2019s testimony. <em>See Florida v. Harris, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014\u2014, 133 S.Ct. 1050, 1057, 185 L.Ed.2d 61 (2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b774-6\">Dimas also challenges the admission of DEA Special Agent Hilda Rubino\u2019s expert testimony as improper \u201cdrug courier profile\u201d evidence. <em>See United States v. Lui, </em>941 F.2d 844, 847 (9th Cir.1991) (noting that drug courier profile evidence may not be used as \u201csubstantive evidence of a defendant\u2019s innocence or guilt\u201d). Rubino testified about the general practices of drug traffickers and provided an opinion that a notebook was a \u201cpay ledger\u201d commonly used in the drug trade. Rubino\u2019s testimony helped explain Dimas\u2019s modus operandi by describing how certain words and actions were consistent with the common practices of drug traffickers. <em>See United States v. Freeman, </em>498 F.3d 893, 906-07 (9th Cir.2007). \u201c[Government agents or similar persons may testify as to the general practices of criminals to establish the defendants\u2019 modus operandi.\u201d <em>United States v. Gil, </em>58 F.3d 1414, 1422 (9th Cir.1995) (quoting <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>735 F.2d 1200, 1202 (9th Cir. 1984)). The district court therefore did not abuse its discretion by admitting Rubino\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-8\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b774-9\">Dimas attacks his sentence as unlawful on the grounds that (a) the district court relied improperly on the drug quantity reported by the DEA when there was conflicting evidence of a lower quantity, (b) the sentence was unreasonable because his co-conspirators received relatively lenient sentences, and (c) the sentence violated the Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-10\">We review the district court\u2019s interpretation of the Guidelines de novo and its factual findings for clear error. <em>United States v. Biao Huang, </em>687 F.3d 1197, 1202 (9th Cir.2012). If the district court correctly calculated the Guidelines range, we review the sentence for reasonableness under the abuse of discretion standard. <em>United States v. Ressam, </em>679 F.3d 1069, 1086 (9th Cir.2012) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b774-11\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b774-12\">The district court did not err in relying on the drug quantity reported by the DEA. The district court found that the DEA agent\u2019s testimony about the sample size, homogeneity, and uncertainty values made the DEA results more credible than the other results. The DEA agent\u2019s testimony fully supported the district court\u2019s determination. Accordingly, the district court\u2019s finding on drug quantity was not clearly erroneous, and the district court correctly applied the higher Guidelines range based on the DEA results. <em>United </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"749\">*749</page-number><em>States v. Kilby, </em>443 F.3d 1135, 1140-42 (9th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b775-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b775-6\">Dimas argues that his below-Guidelines sentence of 200 months was unreasonable considering that his co-eonspirators received 108 months imprisonment. Dimas\u2019s situation differed materially from that of his co-conspirators because his co-conspirators accepted responsibility, cooperated with the Government, and qualified for safety-valve relief. \u201c[A] sentencing disparity based on cooperation is not unreasonable.\u201d <em>United States v. Carter, </em>560 F.3d 1107, 1121 (9th Cir.2009). The district court considered the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) sentencing factors and varied downward from the Guidelines range. The court balanced defendant\u2019s failure to accept responsibility with his lack of criminal history. It found that 235 months was too high based on defendant\u2019s total conduct. The district court made an individualized determination based on Dimas\u2019s characteristics and the characteristics of the offense. The sentence was reasonable under the totality of the circumstances. See <em>United States v. Carty, </em>520 F.3d 984, 993 (9th Cir.2008) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b775-7\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b775-8\">Finally, Dimas argues that his below-Guidelines sentence violates the Eighth Amendment. We review de novo whether a sentence violates the Eighth Amendment. <em>United States v. Meiners, </em>485 F.3d 1211, 1212-13 (9th Cir.2007) (per curiam) (citing <em>United States v. Fernandez, </em>388 F.3d 1199, 1258 (9th Cir.2004)). \u201cGenerally, as long as the sentence imposed on a defendant does not exceed statutory limits, this court will not overturn it on Eighth Amendment grounds.\u201d <em>United States v. Albino, </em>432 F.3d 937, 938 (9th Cir.2005) (per curiam) (quoting <em>United States v. Parker, </em>241 F.3d 1114, 1117 (9th Cir.2001)). Dimas\u2019s sentence was below the Guidelines range and well below the statutory maximum for his offenses. Di-mas fails on a threshold level to show that his sentence is grossly disproportional to the crimes. <em>Meiners, </em>485 F.3d at 1213.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b773-21\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9 th Cir.
