For the following reasons, we will deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-5\">Petitioner is a citizen of China. In 2001, removal proceedings were initiated against him pursuant to INA \u00a7 212(a)(6)(A)\u00ae, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(6)(A)\u00ae, as an alien present in the United States without being admitted or paroled. Petitioner conceded removability but applied for asylum, withholding of removal, and protection under the Convention Against Torture, based on his opposition to China\u2019s population control policies. In 2003, the Immigration Judge (\u201cIJ\u201d) denied relief, finding no credible evidence of past persecution or well-founded fear of future persecution, and ordered Petitioner removed to China. In 2005, the BIA upheld the IJ\u2019s decision. In 2012, Petitioner filed a motion to reopen in the BIA, arguing that he had recently begun practicing Falun Gong and feared persecution on that basis if returned to China. On March 22, 2013, the BIA denied Petitioner\u2019s motion. On April 5, 2013, Petitioner filed a counseled petition for review and a motion to stay removal in this Court. We denied his stay motion on April 21, 2013.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-6\">We begin by making clear the limited scope of this appeal. We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a) only with respect to the BIA\u2019s March 22, 2013 order denying Petitioner\u2019s motion to reopen. The petition for review was not timely filed within 30 days of the BIA\u2019s 2005 order upholding the IJ\u2019s removal order. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(1); <em>Stone v. INS, </em>514 U.S. 386, 405, 115 S.Ct. 1537, 131 L.Ed.2d 465 (1995). The 30-day limitation period is mandatory and jurisdictional. <em>See Vakker v. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>519 F.3d 143, 146 (3d Cir. 2008); <em>McAllister v. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>444 F.3d 178, 185 (3d Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b234-9\">We review the BIA\u2019s denial of a motion to reopen using the \u201chighly deferential\u201d abuse of discretion standard. <em>Guo v. Ashcroft, </em>386 F.3d 556, 562 (3d Cir.2004). A motion to reopen must be filed in the BIA within 90 days of the date of entry of the final order of removal. INA \u00a7 240(c)(7)(C)\u00ae, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(7)(C)(i). There is no time limit on filing a motion to reopen in the BIA if the basis of the motion is to apply for asylum and the motion is based on changed conditions in the country to which removal has been ordered, if such evidence is material and was not available or discoverable at the previous proceeding. <em>See </em>INA \u00a7 240(c)(7)(C)(ii), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(7)(C)(ii). The evidence presented must be genuine, authentic, and objectively reasonable. <em>See In re S-Y-G, </em>24 I. &amp; N. Dec. 247, 251 (BIA 2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b234-12\">We agree with the BIA that Petitioner\u2019s motion to reopen was untimely. The motion was filed over 7 years after the BIA\u2019s May 9, 2005 final order of removal. His motion was subject to the 90-day limitations period because it was not based on changed conditions in China supported by material evidence that was not available or discoverable at the time of the previous proceeding. Instead, Petitioner\u2019s motion sought reopening because he began the practice of Falun Gong in 2011 and feared persecution on that basis if returned to China.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>See Liu v. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>555 F.3d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>145 (3d Cir.2009). However, Petitioner\u2019s motion to reopen fails to demonstrate that the treatment of Falun Gong practitioners in China has materially changed since the time of his removal proceedings. To the contrary, Petitioner acknowledged that \u201c[t]he Chinese government banned Falun Gong in China for over 10 years now.\u201d We further note that the BIA found that the Communist Party notice, which was \u201cunsigned and not authenticated in any manner,\u201d was insufficiently reliable evidence. It also concluded that the letter from Petitioner\u2019s father was unauthenticated, speculative, and written by a third party, and therefore was similarly unreliable. We agree that Petitioner did not establish through reliable evidence that the Chinese authorities were aware of his Falun Gong activities or that he would face persecution on that basis if returned to China. Therefore, we cannot conclude that the BIA abused its discretion in denying the motion.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b234-7\">. In support of his motion, Petitioner submitted a notice addressed to his parents in China by their local village branch of the Communist Party. The notice, dated July 2012, stated that reports had been received of Petitioner\u2019s participation in Falun Gong and demanded he cease his activities and return to China for \"severe punishment.\u201d Petitioner <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>also submitted a letter purportedly from his father stating that Chinese authorities had rushed into his home to serve the notice and demand Petitioner\u2019s return to China for punishment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b235-6\">. Petitioner\u2019s motion to reopen also asked the BIA to invoke its sua sponte authority pursuant to 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(a). In denying reopening, the BIA refused to exercise that authority. We lack jurisdiction to review the BIA\u2019s refusal to exercise its sua sponte authority. <em>Calle-Vujiles v. Ashcroft, </em>320 F.3d 472, 474 (3d Cir.2003).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
