Anderson now challenges the jury\u2019s guilty verdict on four of those counts, as well as the district court\u2019s application of two sentencing enhancements. However, finding sufficient evidence to support the convictions and concluding that the district court did not err in applying either of the enhancements, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-19\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-20\">In late 2007, Anderson took steps to establish a tax preparation business under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>the name of \u201cDL Anderson Tax Service.\u201d She applied to the IRS for authorization to electronically file tax returns and was issued an Electronic Filing Identification Number (\u201cEFIN\u201d) for her business and a Preparer\u2019s Tax Identification Number (\u201cPTIN\u201d) for herself as a paid tax preparer. Anderson used the EFIN and PTIN throughout 2008 to submit returns for the 2007 tax year.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-5\">In February 2009, the IRS interviewed Anderson as part of an investigation into certain returns filed by her business putatively on behalf of paid clients. Each return in question indicated that the refund due was to be deposited into one of several bank accounts controlled by Anderson, and each named Anderson as a third-party designee authorized to receive private tax information relating to the filer. When asked about these returns, Anderson stated that her employee, Tamika Davis, prepared them, but an IRS agent assigned to the case later testified that he could find \u201cno evidence of an existence of that person.\u201d J.A.55.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-6\">On September 21, 2011, a federal grand jury in the District of South Carolina charged Anderson in a twenty-one count superseding indictment with nineteen counts of submitting false, fictitious, or fraudulent claims against the United States, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 287; one count of embezzling public money or property, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 641; and one count of aggravated identity theft, in \u25a0violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1028A. The indictment alleged that Anderson stole the identities of nineteen individuals and used their personal information to file fraudulent tax returns, with refund payments routed to accounts under her control.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-7\">At trial, the government presented testimony by fourteen witnesses whose names appeared on tax returns corresponding to Counts 1, 2, 4-8, 11-14, and 16-18 of the indictment, each filed using Anderson\u2019s EFIN and PTIN. The witnesses testified that they did not authorize Anderson to prepare the returns and that they did not receive any refund payments in connection with the filed returns. Moreover, they indicated that much of the personal information listed on the returns was incorrect.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-9\">The government also called seven other witnesses, among them Ronald Cooley, President and CEO of Brookland Federal Credit Union (\u201cBrookland\u201d); Russell Sciandra, an IRS Special Agent; and Tracy Trivison, General Manager of Receivables Management Corporation (\u201cRMC\u201d), Anderson\u2019s former employer. Cooley testified that Anderson controlled multiple accounts at Brookland and identified certain deposits made by the United States Treasury into those accounts. Sciandra linked the Treasury deposit amounts to refunds claimed on tax returns filed using Anderson\u2019s EFIN and PTIN. And Trivison testified that, while working for RMC, Anderson had access to the names, addresses, social security numbers, and dates of birth of some of the individuals whose tax returns were filed using Anderson\u2019s EFIN and PTIN.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-10\">The jury found Anderson guilty on twenty of the twenty-one counts charged in the indictment. She was acquitted only on Count 10, a false claim charge linked to a tax return for which the refund was deposited into a separate bank account not referenced on any of the eighteen other returns. The individual whose name appeared on the return associated with Count 10 did not testify at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-11\">In calculating Anderson\u2019s Guidelines sentencing range, the Presentence Investigation Report (\u201cPSR\u201d) applied two enhancements now at issue in this appeal, one for the number of victims involved and another for the amount of loss implicated. The PSR reported that there were nine<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>teen victims of Anderson\u2019s crimes, triggering a two-level enhancement pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Bl.l(b)(2), and that the intended loss amount was $437,822, triggering a fourteen-level enhancement pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B1.1(b)(1)(H). After accounting for these enhancements, the PSR arrived at a final Guidelines range of 65 to 75 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-4\">Counsel for Anderson raised ten objections to the PSR, none of which challenged the application of the aforementioned sentencing enhancements and most of which were resolved prior to sentencing. Anderson herself also filed a <em>pro se </em>objection challenging the \u201centire\u201d PSR, but her statement was directed primarily at the jury\u2019s finding of guilt and not at the proposed Guidelines range. She did not raise any specific objection to either enhancement. At the sentencing hearing, the district court denied Anderson\u2019s request for a variance, resolved the outstanding PSR objections \u2014 none of which affected the advisory Guidelines range \u2014 and sentenced Anderson to 75 months of incarceration. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-6\">Anderson first challenges the sufficiency of the evidence supporting the jury\u2019s guilty verdict on four of her eighteen convictions for submitting false or fraudulent claims against the United States. Although Anderson preserved her objection on this issue, we note at the outset that the standard for overturning a jury verdict is a very difficult one to meet: a conviction will be reversed for insufficient evidence \u201conly if no reasonable jury could have concluded beyond a reasonable doubt\u201d that the defendant committed the charged crime. <em>United States v. Sayles, </em>296 F.3d 219, 223 n. 1 (4th Cir.2002). On the other hand, if \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d \u2014 that is, direct or circumstantial evidence \u201cthat a reasonable finder of fact could accept as adequate and sufficient to support a conclusion of a defendant\u2019s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt\u201d supports a 849, 862 (4th Cir.1996) (en banc); <em>see also United States v. Stewart, </em>256 F.3d 231, 249 (4th Cir.2001). Put otherwise, only when the prosecution\u2019s failure to prove its case is \u201cclear\u201d will the defendant prevail in challenging a jury\u2019s guilty verdict. <em>Burks v. United States, </em>437 U.S. 1, 17, 98 S.Ct. 2141, 57 L.Ed.2d 1 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b402-8\">Anderson specifically attacks her convictions on Counts 3, 9, 15, and 19, four counts for which the government did not present live witness testimony as to the fraudulent nature of the corresponding tax returns. Notwithstanding the jury\u2019s guilty verdict, Anderson asserts that she is entitled to a judgment of acquittal because \u201cthere is a total absence of evidence\u201d with respect to the challenged counts. Appellant\u2019s Reply Br. 3. But her argument is unavailing because the prosecution <em>did </em>present substantial evidence of her guilt, although that evidence was not in the form of direct witness testimony about the four specific returns related to those counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-9\">It is well settled that the government is not required to come forward with any particular form of evidence and may proffer direct <em>or </em>circumstantial evidence to make its case. <em>See Stewart, </em>256 F.3d at 249 (citing <em>Glasser v. United States, </em>315 U.S. 60, 80, 62 S.Ct. 457, 86 L.Ed. 680 (1942)). Here, the prosecution presented significant circumstantial evidence demonstrating that Anderson was guilty on Counts 3, 9, 15, and 19, and we therefore affirm her convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-10\">The tax returns associated with the four challenged counts were remarkably similar to those associated with the fourteen other counts on which Anderson was also convicted. All eighteen returns contained Anderson\u2019s EFIN and PTIN \u2014 indicating that she or someone acting at her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>instruction prepared the returns \u2014 -and each return directed the IRS to deposit the refund due into one of two accounts controlled by Anderson. As discussed above, the government presented direct testimonial evidence that fourteen of these eighteen returns contained false information and were filed without the authorization of the individuals named therein, none of whom actually received the associated refunds. That the four other returns contained the same EFIN, PTIN, and bank account information as these fourteen is ample circumstantial evidence from which a reasonable jury could have concluded \u2014 and, here, did conclude \u2014 that Anderson was guilty beyond a reasonable doubt on Counts 3, 9, 15, and 19.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-5\">We need not resolve the question of precisely how many returns would, in some other case, be necessary to establish this pattern of fraud. Rather, we need hold only that the pattern established by direct testimony concerning the fourteen returns unchallenged on appeal was sufficient circumstantial evidence to justify the jury\u2019s conclusion that the four other remarkably similar returns were also false or fraudulent. Faced with the government\u2019s evidence, Anderson offered no satisfactory explanation to the jury as to why those remaining returns were not fraudulent. She was, of course, under no obligation to offer such an explanation, but her failure to do so raised the risk that the jury would accept the government\u2019s evidence. <em>See United States v. Echeverri-Jaramillo, 777 </em>F.2d 933, 938 (4th Cir.1985) (quoting <em>McGautha v. California, </em>402 U.S. 183, 215, 91 S.Ct. 1454, 28 L.Ed.2d 711 (1971)).</p>\n<p id=\"b403-6\">It is worth noting that the jury acquitted Anderson on Count 10, the only count for which the corresponding tax return directed the refund to a bank account not listed on any of the eighteen other returns. The acquittal indicates that the jury was not asleep at the wheel in this case but actually did consider whether the evidence presented by the prosecution \u2014 to wit, the testimonial evidence and the marked resemblances among the eighteen tax returns \u2014 established Anderson\u2019s guilt on each individual count. The jury was convinced by the inculpatory evidence with respect to eighteen of the charged counts, but not by the evidence with respect to Count 10. This outcome is not altogether surprising given that the single return in Count 10 deviated from the pattern displayed by the eighteen other returns. That the jury apparently recognized and reacted to a deviation from the pattern only fortifies the conclusion that the striking conformity to that pattern of the four convictions at issue here provided a sound basis for the jury\u2019s verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-8\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-9\">Next, Anderson challenges the district court\u2019s application of a two-level sentencing enhancement pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Bl.l(b)(2)(A) for the number of victims \u2014 nineteen\u2014involved in this case. As an initial matter, we note that neither Anderson nor her attorney objected to the PSR\u2019s application of this enhancement. Therefore, our review is for plain error.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-10\">Under the plain-error standard, a defendant \u201cmust establish that the district court erred, that the error was plain, and that it affected [her] substantial rights.\u201d <em>United States v. Robinson, </em>627 F.3d 941, 954 (4th Cir.2010) (internal quotation marks and alterations omitted) (citing <em>United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 734, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993)). And even if a defendant meets this heavy burden, an appellate court has \u201cdiscretion whether to recognize the error, and should not do so unless the error seriously affects the fairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>United States v. Har</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number><em>grove, </em>625 F.3d 170, 184 (4th Cir.2010) (internal quotation marks omitted). Here, the district court did not commit error\u2014 much less plain error \u2014 and we therefore affirm its application of the number-of-victims enhancement.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-4\">Pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Bl.l(b)(2)(A), a defendant is subject to a two-level sentencing enhancement if convicted of a theft or fraud offense involving ten or more victims. The commentary to \u00a7 2B1.1 generally defines the term \u201cvictim\u201d as \u201c(A) any person who sustained any part of the actual loss determined under subsection (b)(1); or (B) any individual who sustained bodily injury as a result of the offense.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B1.1 cmt. n.l. However, if an offense \u201cinvolve[s] means of identification,\u201d that definition is expanded to include \u201cany individual whose means of identification was used unlawfully or without authority.\u201d <em>Id. </em>cmt. n.4(E).</p>\n<p id=\"b404-5\">Anderson does not dispute that her conviction brings her within the scope of \u00a7 2Bl.l(b)(2)(A) standing alone, given that she was convicted of using the means of identification of eighteen different individuals to submit fraudulent tax returns. <em>See </em>Appellant\u2019s Br. 18. She argues, however, that the number-of-victims enhancement does not apply to her because that enhancement is based on a \u201cspecific offense characteristic,\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Bl.l(b)(l), and the commentary to a separate Guidelines provision for aggravated identity theft, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B1.6 cmt. n.2, instructs a court to \u201cnot apply any specific offense characteristic for the ... use of a means of identification when determining the sentence for the underlying offense\u201d if the defendant is also being sentenced for aggravated identity theft \u2014 as Anderson was here. The identity theft sentence, so Anderson\u2019s argument goes, is meant to account for the unlawful use of a means of identification, such that application of the expanded definition of \u201cvictim\u201d in \u00a7 2Bl.l(b)(2)(A) would \u201cdouble count\u201d the use of the stolen identities for sentencing purposes. <em>See </em>Appellant\u2019s Br. 18-19.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-7\">We decline to embrace Anderson\u2019s reasoning. Like all of our sister circuits to have considered the issue, we conclude instead that \u00a7 2B1.6 does not preclude a district court from imposing a number-of-victims enhancement in conjunction with a sentence for aggravated identity theft. <em>See United States v. Lyles, </em>2012 WL 5907483, at *5 (6th Cir.2012) (unpublished); <em>United States v. Manatau, </em>647 F.3d 1048, 1057 n. 4 (10th Cir.2011); <em>United States v. Yummi, </em>408 Fed.Appx. 537, 541 (3d Cir. 2010) (unpublished); <em>see also United States v. Jenkins-Watts, </em>574 F.3d 950, 961-62 (8th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b404-8\">Comment 2 to the aggravated identity theft Guidelines provision instructs a district court to refrain from applying an enhancement only if it is triggered by a \u201cspecific offense characteristic for the transfer, possession, or use of a means of identification.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B1.6 cmt. n.2. The most natural reading of the comment limits its application to enhancements linked to the <em>nature of the offense, </em>such as the two-level enhancement found in \u00a7 2Bl.l(b)(ll)(C) that applies if an offense involved \u201cthe unauthorized transfer or use of any means of identification unlawfully to produce or obtain any other means of identification.\u201d Applying this \u201cmeans of identification\u201d enhancement from \u00a7 2Bl.l(b)(ll)(C) in conjunction with an aggravated identity theft sentence would, in fact, augment a defendant\u2019s sentence twice for the same substantive conduct\u2014 use of a means of identification. Thus, per Comment 2, an enhancement under \u00a7 2Bl.l(b)(ll)(C) cannot be imposed alongside a sentence for aggravated identity theft.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>By contrast, the \u00a7 2Bl.l(b)(2)(A) enhancement at issue here looks only to the <em>number of victims </em>of the offense. That the term \u201cvictim\u201d is defined to include the individuals whose means of identification were used in the crime does not transform \u00a7 2B1.1 (b)(2)(A) into an enhancement triggered by a \u201cspecific offense characteristic for the transfer, possession, or use of a means of identification.\u201d As the Sixth Circuit has explained, the number-of-victims enhancement \u201cpunishes the impact of the crime, not the transfer, possession, or use of a means of identification.\u201d <em>Lyles, </em>2012 WL 5907483, at *5. As such, the instructions contained in Comment 2 do not bar the application of that enhancement here.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-5\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-6\">Finally, Anderson challenges the fourteen-level sentencing enhancement triggered by the PSR\u2019s conclusion that her intended loss was $437,822. As with the number-of-victims enhancement, our review here is for plain error because neither Anderson nor her attorney objected to the PSR\u2019s calculation of the loss amount or to the district court\u2019s subsequent application of the corresponding enhancement. After reviewing Anderson\u2019s contentions, we find no plain error in the district court\u2019s sentencing decision on this point.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-7\">Although the PSR states that \u201c[t]he facts of the case revealed the actual loss amount was $437,822.00,\u201d J.A. 470, Anderson contends that she is subject to an enhancement only for the loss of $65,911 that was found by a jury, <em>see </em>Appellant\u2019s Br. 24-25. However, it is clear that a district court may consider facts not found by a jury when issuing a sentence somewhere between the statutory minimum and maximum. <em>See Harris v. United States, </em>536 U.S. 545, 566, 122 S.Ct. 2406, 153 L.Ed.2d 524 (2002).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Here, the district judge made a factual finding \u2014 based on the PSR \u2014 that Anderson\u2019s intended loss amount was $437,822. That finding triggered an enhancement but did not take Anderson\u2019s sentence beyond the statutory maximum for her offenses. A sentencing judge must remain free to make run-of-the-mill factual findings underlying advisory Guidelines enhancements without eliciting constitutional concerns. That is all the judge did here, and the amount-of-loss enhancement was thus permissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-10\">Anderson next complains that, even if the trial judge was free to impose an enhancement based on facts not found by a jury, the government failed to provide sufficient evidence to support the PSR\u2019s loss calculation of $437,822. Appellant\u2019s Br. 21. But we must reject Anderson\u2019s contention at the outset, because the government is not required to present evidence demonstrating the accuracy of facts in a PSR. <em>See United States v. Terry, </em>916 F.2d 157, 162 (4th Cir.1990). When challenging a PSR, a defendant \u201chas an affirmative duty to make a showing that the information in the [document] is unreliable, and articulate the reasons why the facts contained therein are untrue or inaccurate.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cWithout an affirmative showing the information is inaccurate, the court is \u2018free to adopt the findings of the [PSR] without more specific inquiry or explanation.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>United States v. Mueller, </em>902 F.2d 336, 346 (5th Cir.1990)). Here, Anderson failed to make an affirmative showing that the loss calculation in the PSR was inaccurate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>or unreliable, and her objection to that calculation now must therefore fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-4\">Moreover, Anderson\u2019s argument misses the mark for a separate reason: the record <em>does </em>contain unrebutted evidence supporting the PSR\u2019s loss calculation. We note as an initial matter that, for Guidelines sentencing purposes, loss amount is not limited to the actual loss resulting from the charged conduct. Rather, the Guidelines indicate that the defendant\u2019s <em>intended </em>loss is the relevant figure when it exceeds actual loss, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B1.1 cmt. n.3(A), and both charged <em>and </em>uncharged conduct may be considered, <em>see </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.3(a) &amp; cmt. background. Moreover, a sentencing court need not precisely calculate intended loss, as the Guidelines require only \u201ca reasonable estimate of the loss.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B1.1 cmt. n.3(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b406-5\">At trial, the government introduced certain bank statements from Anderson\u2019s accounts at Brookland, but was not permitted to introduce evidence that the Treasury deposited $333,403 worth of tax refunds into those accounts in 2008. The district judge ruled that the government could introduce evidence of loss associated with only the nineteen counts charged in this case. Thus, the jury was not permitted to review the $333,403 figure, although it is referenced in the record.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b406-6\">It is well settled, however, that the ordinary rules of evidence do not apply in the sentencing phase of a criminal proceeding. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3661; Fed.R.Evid. 1101(d)(3). Thus, the fact that indications of the total loss amount were not before the jury did not bar the PSR or the trial judge from using such evidence to determine Anderson\u2019s sentence. Of course, in the absence of any objection, the government had no obligation to affirmatively establish the total loss amount stated in the PSR in the first place. <em>See Terry, </em>916 F.2d at 162. However, the ample evidentiary support for that loss calculation only bolsters our conclusion that the district court did not err \u2014 much less commit plain error \u2014 when it applied the fourteen-level sentencing enhancement in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-9\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-10\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"A5R\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b405-8\">. Anderson asks us to vacate her sentence and remand the matter in light of the Supreme Court\u2019s grant of certiorari in <em>United States v. Alleyne, </em>457 Fed.Appx. 348 (4th Cir.2011) (unpublished), <em>cert. </em>granted, \u2014 U.S. \u2014, 133 S.Ct. 420, 184 L.Ed.2d 252 (2012) (No. 11-9335).

The record also indicates that the IRS was \"actually able to identify some of the refunds as fraudulent and stop them before they went out.\u201d J.A. 274. Therefore, it is unremarkable that Anderson's intended loss amount ($437,-822) exceeds the amount of fraudulent tax refund payments actually deposited into her accounts ($333,403).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b406-11\">WYNN, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"AgH\">dissenting:</p>\n<p id=\"b406-12\">To prove a violation 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 287, the government bears the burden of establishing \u201ctwo elements: 1) making or presenting a claim to any agency of the United States 2) knowing such claim to be false, fictitious, or fraudulent.\u201d <em>United States v. Ewing, </em>957 F.2d 115, 119 (4th Cir.1992). There is no dispute that filing a tax return for a refund constitutes \u201cpresenting a claim\u201d to the IRS. The key issue here is whether the government presented sufficient evidence to show that each of the tax returns in this matter supporting an individual count under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 287 was \u201cfalse, fictitious, or fraudulent.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b406-13\">For the fourteen returns supporting Counts 1, 2, 4-8, 11-14, and 16-18, the government presented not only the returns but also the persons named on those returns, who testified that the returns were unauthorized and or inaccurate. Accordingly, I agree with the majority that the government met its burden of proof under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 287 as to those fourteen counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-14\">As to Counts 3, 9, 15, and 19, however, the government presented only the four <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>returns. The government essentially argued that because these naked returns looked just like the fourteen returns clothed by witnesses\u2019 testimonies, they were dressed in the requisite criminality. The majority apparently agreed, stating that the four naked returns were \u201cremarkably similar\u201d to the returns clothed by witnesses\u2019 testimonies. Supra 876. But the only similarities between the naked and clothed returns \u2014 -the tax preparer information (PTIN and EFIN) and refund destination \u2014 show nothing inherently false or fraudulent about the four naked returns.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-5\">Moreover, the use of the PTIN and EFIN shows only that DL Anderson prepared the return, not that this preparation was unauthorized. Similarly, the use of the routing number shows only that the refund was to be deposited into an account controlled by Anderson, not that this direction was unsanctioned. Nor is it unlawful to direct a refund to a tax preparer or another third party. Put simply, the tax preparer information (PTIN and EFIN) and refund destination appear on all returns filed by tax preparers. Indeed, based on this evidence, the returns were just as likely honest and accurate as they were fraudulent and false.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-6\">Further, merely associating these naked returns with the fourteen other returns was an insufficient basis for convicting Anderson on Counts 3, 9, 15, and 19. A pattern of conduct may be used to connect a crime to a particular individual or establish intent. Here, however, the pattern is not being used to infer that it was Anderson who filed the four returns, but that those returns were false in the first place \u2014 that there was, in fact, a crime. <em>See United States v. Drape, </em>668 F.2d 22, 26 (1st Cir.1982) (\u201cAppellant\u2019s signature on his [tax] return was sufficient to establish knowledge <em>once it had been shown that the return was </em>/afee.\u201d)(emphasis added). Yet this cannot be, as \u201c[t]he first presumption is that a defendant is innocent unless and until the government proves beyond a reasonable doubt each element of the offense charged.\u201d <em>Clark v. Arizona, </em>548 U.S. 735, 766, 126 S.Ct. 2709, 165 L.Ed.2d 842 (2006). Drawing this inference belies the bedrock principle of criminal law that the government bears the burden of proving each element of an offense. <em>In re Winship, </em>397 U.S. 358, 364, 90 S.Ct. 1068, 25 L.Ed.2d 368 (\u201c[W]e explicitly hold that the Due Process Clause protects the accused against conviction except upon proof beyond a reasonable doubt of every fact necessary to constitute the crime with which he is charged.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b407-8\">To be sure, the government need not have presented direct witness testimony to demonstrate that the tax returns associated with Counts 3, 9, 15, and 19 were false or fraudulent; nonetheless, some evidence was required to carry the government\u2019s burden to prove this element \u2014 and none was presented. Because the evidence at trial was insufficient for any rational fact\u2014 finder to conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that these four naked returns were false or fraudulent, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
