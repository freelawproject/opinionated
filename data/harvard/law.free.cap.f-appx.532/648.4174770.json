The United States contends that the district court erred in determining that Hiser\u2019s prior burglary convictions did not constitute crimes of violence for purposes of sentence enhancement according to U.S.S.G \u00a7 2K2.1(a)(2). We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-20\">We review the district court\u2019s interpretation of the sentencing guidelines de novo. <em>United States v. Alvarez-Hernandez, </em>478 F.3d 1060, 1063 (9th Cir.2007). Hiser\u2019s prior two convictions were for burglary in violation of Nev.Rev.Stat. 205.060. Nevada\u2019s burglary statute is facially broader than the generic definition of burglary because it \u201cdoes not require the entry to have been unlawful in the way most burglary laws do.\u201d <em>Descamps v. United </em>States, \u2014 U.S. \u2014, 133 S.Ct. 2276, 2282, 186 L.Ed.2d 438 (2013). Nevada has long since eliminated \u201c[t]he common-law vestige of \u2018breaking\u2019 as an element in the crime of burglary.\u201d <em>McNeeley v. State, </em>81 Nev. 663, 409 P.2d 135, 136 (1965) (citing <em>State v. Watkins, </em>11 Nev. 30 (1876)). Under Nevada\u2019s statute, consent to entry is not a defense, \u201cso long as the defendant was shown to have made the entry with larcenous intent.\u201d <em>Thomas v. State, </em>94 Nev. 605, 584 P.2d 674, 677 (1978) (citing favorably for support <em>People v. Deptula, </em>58 Cal.2d 225, 23 Cal.Rptr. 366, 373 P.2d 430, 431-32 (1962) (en banc)). Accordingly, Nevada courts have upheld convictions for burglary that did not include unlawful entry. <em>See, e.g., Stephans v. State, </em>262 P.3d 727 (Nev.2011) (upholding burglary conviction for shoplifting). Thus, Nevada\u2019s burglary statute is quite similar to that of California\u2019s. <em>See Descamps, </em>133 S.Ct. at 2282-83 (citing <em>People v. Barry, </em>94 Cal. 481, 29 P. 1026, 1026-27 (1892) (\u201cThe common-law element, to wit, the use of force by breaking, in order to constitute burglary, was originally a part of our statute; but it has long since ceased to exist.... That the entry is made in the daytime, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"649\">*649</page-number>when the store is open for business, may render it more difficult to prove the criminal intent present in the mind of the defendant when he enters; but that is a matter of evidence, and not a question of law.\u201d)). \u201cIn sweeping so widely, [Nevada\u2019s burglary statute] goes beyond the normal, \u2018generic\u2019 definition of burglary.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Therefore, Hiser\u2019s prior two convictions could not constitute crimes of violence under the categorical approach. <em>See id. </em>at 2283-84.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-5\">Additionally, because the Nevada statute is indivisible with respect to the element of entry \u2014 an element we determined is broader than the generic definition of burglary \u2014 we are precluded from applying the modified categorical approach under the Supreme Court\u2019s recent decision in <em>Descamps. See id. </em>at 2293. Reading the Nevada burglary statute in conjunction with Nev.Rev.Stat. 205.065, as the government contends we must, does not alter this conclusion, as the latter statute only indicates what reasonable inferences a jury may make if they determine the entry was unlawful. It does not change the fact that an individual can be convicted under the Nevada statute without \u201cbreaking and entering or [committing] similar conduct ... [and covers] a shoplifter who enters a store, like any customer, during normal business hours.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2282. Therefore, we are precluded from implementing the modified categorical approach in conducting our categorical analysis of the Nevada burglary statute. <em>See id. </em>at 2283-84, 2293.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b674-23\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
