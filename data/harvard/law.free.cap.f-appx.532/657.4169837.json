The BIA denied Hossain\u2019s motion to reopen on July 15, 2008. Hossain moved for reconsideration, which the BIA granted. Upon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"658\">*658</page-number>reconsideration of Hossain\u2019s request to reopen, the BIA again denied the motion to reopen on December 22, 2008. We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(1), and we deny Hossain\u2019s consolidated petitions for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-4\">The BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying Hossain\u2019s motion to reopen. The motion was untimely because it was not filed \u201cwithin 90 days of the date of entry of a final administrative order of removal.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(7)(C)(i). Further, Hossain was not entitled to equitable tolling based on purported ineffective assistance of counsel because he failed to demonstrate that he acted \u201cwith due diligence in discovering the deception, fraud or error.\u201d <em>Iturribarria v. INS, </em>321 F.3d 889, 897 (9th Cir.2003) (\u201cThis court ... recognizes equitable tolling of deadlines and numerical limits on motions to reopen or reconsider during periods when a petitioner is prevented from filing because of deception, fraud, or error, <em>as long as the petitioner acts with due diligence in discovering the deception, fraud, or error.\u201d </em>(emphasis added)).</p>\n<p id=\"b684-5\">In evaluating whether Hossain exercised due diligence, we consider the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b684-6\">First, we determine if (and when) a reasonable person in petitioner\u2019s position would suspect the specific fraud or error underlying her motion to reopen. Second, we ascertain whether petitioner took reasonable steps to investigate the suspected fraud or error, or, if petitioner is ignorant of counsel\u2019s shortcomings, whether petitioner made reasonable efforts to pursue relief.... Third, we assess when the tolling period should end; that is, when petitioner definitively learns of the harm resulting from counsel\u2019s deficiency, or obtains \u201cvital information bearing on the existence of his claim.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b684-7\"><em>Avagyan v. Holder, </em>646 F.3d 672, 679 (9th Cir.2011) (internal citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b684-8\">Applying the foregoing factors, we agree with the BIA\u2019s finding that a reasonable person in Hossain\u2019s position would have suspected his former counsel\u2019s deficient performance at least as early as February 2006, when his former counsel advised him of the BIA\u2019s February 9, 2006, decision denying his appeal. Hossain, a trained lawyer in Bangladesh, contends that even prior to the BIA\u2019s denial of his appeal, his former counsel failed to adequately prepare him for the merits hearing in October 2004 before the Immigration Judge. Hossain also contends that, prior to the hearing, his former counsel failed to discuss with him the legal requirements for asylum, withholding of removal, or protection under the Convention Against Torture. Hossain admits that later, within a short time after the BIA denied his appeal, his former counsel read to him the BIA\u2019s decision. Despite numerous signs that would have alerted a reasonable person \u2014 much less one with the legal education and training like Hossain \u2014 to his counsel\u2019s possible deficient performance, Hossain nevertheless failed to take any action to investigate until he met with current counsel on October 12, 2007. <em>See Avagyan, </em>646 F.3d at 680 (holding that the denial of petitioner\u2019s appeal to the BIA \u201cwould have put a reasonable person in [the petitioner\u2019s] position on notice that something was wrong with [his attorneys\u2019] preparation for the removal hearing\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b684-9\">Under these circumstances, the BIA did not abuse its discretion in concluding that Hossain was not entitled to equitable tolling because he failed to act diligently when he filed a motion to reopen more than three years after his former counsel\u2019s inadequate performance at the merit hearing and more than two years after the BIA denied his administrative appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"659\">*659</page-number>We need not and do not reach the remaining issues raised on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-5\">PETITIONS FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"AIJ\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
