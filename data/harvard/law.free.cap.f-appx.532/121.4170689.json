Navarrete also appeals the District Court\u2019s denial of his motion for reconsideration. For the reasons that follow, we will summarily affirm the judgment of the District Court. <em>See </em>3d Cir. L.A.R. 27.4; I.O.P. 10.6.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-22\">Navarrete commenced this action against the United States of America, the Federal Bureau of Prisons (\u201cFBOP\u201d), the Warden of FCI-Fort Dix, the Education Supervisor at FCI-Fort Dix, the President of Louisiana State University (\u201cLSU\u201d), and the owner of the Barnes &amp; Noble Book Store at LSU.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> He alleged that, while incarcerated, he enrolled in a correspondence course at LSU, but that the mail-room at FCI-Fort Dix improperly refused delivery of his course textbooks. As a result, he was unable to complete the course. In his complaint, Navarrete asserted that defendants violated his rights under the First, Fourth, Fifth, Eighth and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>Fourteenth Amendments, and unspecified state laws.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-4\">The District Court dismissed sua sponte for failure to state a claim, all of Navarrete\u2019s claims except his First and Fifth Amendment claims against the Warden of FCI-Fort Dix. Following discovery, the District Court granted the Warden\u2019s motion for summary judgment on Navarrete\u2019s remaining claims. Navarrete filed a motion for reconsideration, which the District Court denied. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-5\">We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. Our review of the District Court\u2019s dismissal for failure to state a claim, as well as its grant of summary judgment, is plenary. <em>Barefoot Architect, Inc. v. Bunge, </em>632 F.3d 822, 826 (3d Cir. 2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b148-6\">We determine that the District Court properly dismissed any <em>Bivens </em>claims against the United States, FBOP, and FCI-Fort Dix.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>See Corr. Servs. Corp. v. Malesko, </em>534 U.S. 61, 72, 122 S.Ct. 515, 151 L.Ed.2d 456 (2001) (holding that <em>Bivens </em>claims may only be brought against individual federal officers, not the United States or its agencies).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Navarrete\u2019s constitutional claims against LSU and the Barnes and Noble bookstore, both private entities, were also properly dismissed. <em>Corr. Servs. Corp., </em>534 U.S. at 71, 122 S.Ct. 515. Moreover, as the District Court noted, Barnes and Noble issued Navarrete a refund after the store received the returned books. We also agree, for the reasons given by the District Court, that Navarrete failed to allege any facts demonstrating the denial of any rights under the Fourth, Eighth, or Fourteenth Amendments.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-10\">We further conclude that the District Court properly granted the Warden of FCI-Dix\u2019s motion for summary judgment on Navarrete\u2019s First and Fifth Amendment claims. Even assuming that the return of Navarrete\u2019s course textbooks violated his First and Fifth Amendment rights, he did not set forth any evidence upon which a jury could conclude that the Warden had any personal involvement in that decision, and a <em>Bivens </em>claim cannot be premised upon a theory of respondeat superior. <em>See Ashcroft v. Iqbal, </em>556 U.S. 662, 675-77, 129 S.Ct. 1937, 173 L.Ed.2d 868 (2009); <em>Argueta v. U.S. Immigration &amp; Customs Enforcement, </em>643 F.3d 60, 71-72 (3d Cir.2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b148-11\">Finally, the District Court did not abuse its discretion in denying Navarrete\u2019s motion for reconsideration, as it did not include any of the grounds required for reconsideration. <em>See Lazaridis v. Wehmer, </em>591 F.3d 666, 669 (3d Cir.2010) (per curiam) (Rule 59 motion \u201cmust rely on one of three grounds: (1) an intervening change in controlling law; (2) the availability of new evidence; or (3) the need to correct clear error of law or prevent manifest injustice\u201d).</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b147-16\">. Although Navarrete sought relief under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, the District Court construed his suit as an action under <em>Bivens </em>v. <em>Six Unknown Named Agents of the Federal Bureau of Narcotics, </em>403 U.S. 388, 91 S.Ct. 1999, 29 L.Ed.2d 619 (1971), not \u00a7 1983, because it involved federal (and alleged federal) actors rather than state actors. <em>See Bivens, </em>403 U.S. at 389, 91 S.Ct. 1999 (recognizing a private cause of action to recover damages against federal actors for constitutional violations).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b148-7\"><em>. </em>We construe Navarrete\u2019s notice of appeal as also challenging the District Court's earlier order dismissing some of his claims.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b148-8\">. To the extent that the complaint could be construed as attempting to assert a claim under the Federal Tort Claims Act (\"FTCA\u201d), we agree with the District Court that it did not have subject matter jurisdiction under the FTCA. A claim may not be brought pursuant to the FTCA unless the plaintiff has first exhausted his administrative remedies. <em>See White-Squire v. U.S. Postal Serv., </em>592 F.3d 453, 457 (3d Cir.2010) (quoting 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2675(a)). This requirement \"is jurisdictional and cannot be waived.\u201d <em>Roma v. United States, </em>344 F.3d 352, 362 (3d Cir.2003) (citation omitted). Navarrete does not claim to have availed himself of, let alone exhausted, available administrative remedies.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
