The District Court dismissed Bey\u2019s habeas petition for failure to exhaust his state court remedies, and Bey has timely appealed from that ruling. <em>See </em>D.N.J. l:13-ev-02846. In his instant petition for a writ of mandamus, Bey requests that this Court enter an order \u201cdirecting the District Court to dismiss Respondents [sic] claims for lack of subject matter jurisdiction----\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We interpret this as a request that we order the District Court to grant Bey\u2019s habeas petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-21\">Mandamus is a drastic remedy available in only the most extraordinary circumstances, and \u201cshould not be issued where relief can be obtained through an ordinary appeal.\u201d <em>In re Chambers Dev. Co., </em>148 F.3d 214, 223 (3d Cir.1998) (quoting <em>Hahnemann Univ. Hosp. v. Edgar, </em>74 F.3d 456, 462 (3d Cir.1996)). Accordingly, as Bey can seek the requested relief through the appellate process, we deny Bey\u2019s petition for a writ of mandamus.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b73-16\">. Bey has been indicted on two counts of committing forgery with purpose to defraud and one count of theft by deception stemming from two episodes where Bey allegedly altered checks and cashed them. In his petition, Bey asserts that the Superior Court of New Jersey does not have jurisdiction over him, as he is a \u201cMoorish American\" citizen, and is not subject to the jurisdiction of the courts of the United States per the laws of the Moorish American National Republic, the Thirteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution, and the Emancipation Proclamation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b73-24\">. Bey\u2019s petition also seeks to have the District Court certify its rulings under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292(b). As the District Court\u2019s order is not an interlocutory decision, no certification is needed to allow Bey to appeal. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292(b).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
