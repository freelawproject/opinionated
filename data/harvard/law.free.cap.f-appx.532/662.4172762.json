Maricopa County, </em>693 F.3d 896, 928 (9th Cir.2012). The district court did not err in dismissing the federal claims set forth in Carson\u2019s original and first amended complaint because neither complaint satisfied the pleading standards set forth in <em>Bell Atlantic Corporation v. Twombly, </em>550 U.S. 544, 570, 127 S.Ct. 1955, 167 L.Ed.2d 929 (2007), and <em>Ashcroft v. Iqbal, </em>556 U.S. 662, 678, 129 S.Ct. 1937, 173 L.Ed.2d 868 (2009). Carson alleged insufficient facts to support the inference that Jacobsen acted under color of state law. <em>See Anderson v. Warner, </em>451 F.3d 1063, 1068-69 (9th Cir.2006). Jacob-sen\u2019s status as a peace officer at the time of the alleged incident does not automatically render his conduct state action. <em>See Gritchen v. Collier, </em>254 F.3d 807, 812-13 (9th Cir.2001). The district court did not abuse its discretion in dismissing Carson\u2019s federal claims without further leave to amend because amendment would have been futile. <em>See Kendall v. Visa U.S.A, Inc., </em>518 F.3d 1042, 1051 (9th Cir.2008). After two attempts, Carson failed to allege facts supporting the inference that Jacob-sen acted under color of law. <em>See id. </em>at 1051-52.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-21\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b688-26\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
