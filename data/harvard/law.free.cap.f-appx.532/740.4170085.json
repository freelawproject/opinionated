We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-7\">Corona contends that his trial counsel, Richard Pintal, provided ineffective assistance by failing to conduct an adequate investigation into the extent of Corona\u2019s intoxication at the time of the crime, failing to adequately research the law on the voluntary intoxication defense and failing to present sufficient evidence at trial to obtain a jury instruction on voluntary intoxication. Corona has presented no evidence establishing the extent of Pintal\u2019s investigation or the sufficiency of Pintal\u2019s legal research. The newly proffered declarations from witnesses with information about the extent of Corona\u2019s intoxication do not establish the inadequacy of the investigation, because they do not establish that Pintal failed altogether to contact pertinent witnesses or obtain comparable evidence from other sources. We therefore cannot conclude that the state court\u2019s dismissal of Corona\u2019s ineffective assistance of counsel claim was \u201cnecessarily unreasonable.\u201d <em>Cullen v. Pinholster, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 131 S.Ct. 1388, 1403, 179 L.Ed.2d 557 (2011); <em>see also </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b767-9\">Given the considerable latitude trial counsel has in making tactical decisions, <em>see Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 689, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984), Pintal\u2019s chosen defense strategy\u2014 exploiting the victims\u2019 inconsistent statements in hopes of creating reasonable doubt, rather than focusing on Corona\u2019s intoxication \u2014 does not fall outside the \u201cwide range of reasonable professional assistance\u201d deemed adequate under the Fifth Amendment, <em>see id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b767-12\">Corona also suffered no prejudice from the alleged deficient representation because the jury is unlikely to have found that Corona lacked the requisite mental state even if the additional evidence had been presented. The jury heard ample evidence of Corona taking purposeful, deliberate actions in his attempt to kill his victims: he confronted his wife about another party-goer, beat her, picked up a rifle, loaded the rifle with at least seven bullets, pointed the rifle at his wife, pulled the trigger, pointed the rifle at his wife\u2019s friend, pulled the trigger and had the presence of mind to leave before the police arrived. Thus, even if Pintal had presented the newly proffered evidence and obtained a jury instruction on voluntary intoxication, there is not a \u201csubstantial ... likelihood of a different result.\u201d <em>Pinholster, </em>131 S.Ct. at 1403 (internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting <em>Harrington v. Richter, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 131 S.Ct. 770, 791, 178 L.Ed.2d 624 (2011)).</p>\n<p id=\"b767-15\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b767-10\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
