The reduction requested was authorized pursuant to United States Sentencing Guidelines \u00a7 1B1.10(a) and Amendment 750. <em>See Dillon v. United States, </em>560 U.S. 817, 130 S.Ct. 2683, 2691, 177 L.Ed.2d 271 (2010). We review the district court\u2019s denial for an abuse of discretion and its factual findings for clear error. <em>United States v. Evans, </em>587 F.3d 667, 672 (5th Cir .2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b562-22\">In its order denying Davis\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion, the district court stated that, upon consideration of the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors, a further sentence reduction was not warranted. Specifically, the district court noted that Davis had been convicted of participating in a drug conspiracy that had lasted for at least six years and which had led to the distribution of \u201cmulti-kilogram quantities of crack cocaine.\u201d The district court further observed that Davis had possessed several firearms during the conspiracy and had shown an interest in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>obtaining \u201ccop-killing ammunition.\u201d Finally, the district court stated: \u201cThe Defendant was in trouble with authorities at least from the age of 14, exhibiting progressively more dangerous and violent behavior. He was implicated in at least one drive-by shooting and involved on more than one occasion with threatening another \u2022with a firearm.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b563-5\">Davis argues that the district court clearly erred by basing its denial on unreliable evidence regarding the six-year duration of the conspiracy, the \u201cmultikilogram\u201d quantities of crack cocaine involved, and Davis\u2019s possession of firearms and ammunition. As evidence to the contrary, Davis offers that he was indicted for a conspiracy lasting for under two years, that he was held accountable for 1.69 kilograms of crack cocaine, and that when law enforcement officials searched his residence, they found only one firearm.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-6\">The district court\u2019s characterization of 1.69 kilograms of crack cocaine as a \u201cmultikilogram\u201d quantity is not inaccurate. Further, the facts relied upon by the district court were sufficiently supported by information in the presentence report (PSR). While Davis was found guilty of conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute crack cocaine alleged in the indictment to have lasted from June 1998 to November 1999, the PSR describes transactions involving crack cocaine between Davis and his co-defendants beginning in the summer of 1994. The PSR also indicates that Davis possessed multiple firearms during the course of the conspiracy. Davis has offered no evidence to contradict these facts. <em>See United States v. Harris, </em>702 F.3d 226, 230 (5th Cir.2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b563-7\">We need not decide whether the prohibition against considering bare arrest records set forth in <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>648 F.3d 273, 276-78 (5th Cir.2011), applies in \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceedings. Even if <em>Johnson </em>\u2019s rationale applies, the arrests considered by the district court were supported adequately in the PSR by \u201cspecific information about the conduct and circumstances relating to the arrests.\u201d <em>Harris, </em>702 F.3d at 230 n. 1; <em>cf. Johnson, </em>648 F.3d at 274-75 (district court committed procedural error in relying on defendant\u2019s arrest record where the PSR \u201clisted only ... the date, the charges, the agency out of which the arrest was processed, and the disposition\u201d and \u201ccontained no information about the underlying facts or circumstances of the arrests and no explanation of why [the defendant] was not prosecuted\u201d). Davis fails to offer any evidence showing that the relevant information in the PSR was unreliable. <em>See Harris, </em>702 F.3d at 231.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-9\">Davis also argues that because the district court did not find that the \u00a7 3553(a) factors weighed against granting his first \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion, it was precluded from doing so in denying his second motion pursuant to the law of the case doctrine. However, because the district court had never before considered whether the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors warranted a sentence reduction below 235 months at the time that it considered the \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion at issue, the denial was not precluded by the law of the case. <em>See Pepper v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 131 S.Ct. 1229, 1250-51, 179 L.Ed.2d 196 (2011). Finally, Davis contends that the district court failed to adequately consider his post-conviction rehabilitation efforts. The district court implicitly considered Davis\u2019s arguments regarding his post-conviction rehabilitation but denied the motion based upon its consideration of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors; it was under no obligation to reduce his sentence. <em>See Evans, </em>587 F.3d at 673.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"ALA\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
