Because we cannot conclusively determine that Samaniego is not entitled to relief based on the existing record, we vacate the district court\u2019s judgment denying Samaniego\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion and remand for an evidentiary hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-14\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-15\">In 2007, Samaniego pleaded guilty to a two-count superseding information pursuant to a written plea agreement. The first count charged Samaniego with possession with intent to distribute methamphetamine in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1), (b)(1)(C) (\u201cCount one\u201d), and the second count charged him with possession with intent to distribute less than 50 kilograms of marijuana in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1), (b)(1)(D) (\u201cCount two\u201d). These charges were based on incidents that occurred on January 25, 2007 and March 3, 2007 in San Angelo, Texas.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-17\">On January 25, 2007, San Angelo police officers stopped Samaniego while he was driving and arrested him for outstanding warrants and driving without a valid license. While searching his vehicle, officers discovered a backpack containing plastic bags, digital scales, a police scanner, and 4.5 ounces of marijuana. This incident was the basis for Count two of the superseding information.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-18\">On March 3, 2007, San Angelo police officers conducted a traffic stop on a vehicle in which Samaniego was a passenger. One of the officers noticed a plastic bag containing a crystalline substance on the floorboard of the backseat, which was directly in front of where Samaniego was sitting. A search of the vehicle revealed digital scales, plastic bags, and 202 grams of methamphetamine. Samaniego was arrested and taken to the San Angelo police station. Samaniego\u2019s factual resume states that once there, San Angelo police officers \u201cinformed Samaniego of his consti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>tutional rights and he agreed to waive those rights and speak with the officers.\u201d Samaniego admitted that the methamphetamine in the vehicle was his. According to Samaniego\u2019s presentence investigation report (\u201cPSR\u201d), Samaniego went on to provide the officers with a detailed confession of his drug distribution activities since 2005. The March 3, 2007 incident served as the basis for Count one of the superseding information.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-5\">Samaniego\u2019s sentencing hearing was held on March 21, 2008. Relying on his March 3, 2007 confession, the PSR held Samaniego accountable for 166.47 kilograms of methamphetamine and 1.11 kilograms of marijuana, which gave him a base offense level of 38. The PSR added two levels because Samaniego imported drugs from Mexico and four additional levels because he was a leader or organizer in a criminal activity involving five or more participants. After subtracting three levels for acceptance of responsibility, Samaniego\u2019s total offense level was 41. That offense level combined with a criminal history category of I produced a guidelines range of 324 to 405 months. However, the statutory maximum sentence for Count 1 was 240 months and for Count 2 was 60 months, for a maximum possible sentence of 300 months. Therefore, the PSR adopted 300 months as Samaniego\u2019s guidelines range. On March 21, 2008, the district court sentenced Samaniego to the statutory maximum 300 months of imprisonment. Samaniego appealed to this court and his conviction was affirmed. <em>See United States v. Samaniego, </em>303 Fed.Appx. 178 (5th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b559-6\">On December 10, 2009 Samaniego, proceeding pro se, filed a sworn \u00a7 2255 motion in the district court arguing, among other things, that his lawyer was constitutionally ineffective because he failed to file a motion to suppress his March 3, 2007 confession. He alleged that before he pleaded guilty he told his lawyer that when he was arrested on March 3, 2007 he \u201cinvoked his right to counsel and was denied.\u201d He also alleged that he informed the police officers who interviewed him that he was \u201cHigh as a kite\u201d and that \u201che had been up for two weeks without sleep and therefore did not understand the nature of the Statement [the] Police Officers coerced him to sign.\u201d He asserted that the police officers \u201cinduced [him] to sign the Statement by falsely promising ... he would receive leniency\u201d and that the officers further coerced him by threatening to have his \u201ctwo young children placed into State Custody.\u201d Samaniego further alleged that the officers \u201cthreatened and coerced [him] into signing the Statement by telling [him] that Officers would make a record of [his] refusal to sign and that this might result in [him] receiving harsher punishment and treatment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b559-8\">The Government filed a response and Samaniego filed a reply. On September 27, 2011 the district court entered an opinion denying Samaniego\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion. With respect to Samaniego\u2019s claim that his counsel was ineffective for failing to file a motion to suppress, the district court stated only that \u201cfailing to file a frivolous motion or make a frivolous objection \u2018does not cause counsel\u2019s performance to fall below an objective level of reasonableness.\u2019 \u201d Samaniego\u2019s former trial counsel did not file a response to the \u00a7 2255 motion and the court did not hold an evidentiary hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-9\">Samaniego appealed pro se and moved for a certificate of appealability (\u201cCOA\u201d). This court granted a COA \u201con the question whether the district court erred in determining that Samaniego was not denied effective assistance by counsel\u2019s failure to file a motion to suppress where the district court did not explicitly address Samanie<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>go\u2019s sworn assertions in his \u00a7 2255 motion that his statement was uncounseled and coerced and where the record gives no indication of counsel\u2019s reasons for not filing such a motion.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b560-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-5\">On appeal, Samaniego argues that the district court erred by failing to hold an evidentiary hearing and by denying his ineffective assistance of counsel claim based on his lawyer\u2019s failure to file a motion to suppress.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In an appeal from the denial of a \u00a7 2255 motion, \u201cthis court reviews a district court\u2019s factual findings for clear error and its legal conclusions <em>de novo.\u201d United States v. Cavitt, </em>550 F.3d 430, 435 (5th Cir.2008). We review the district court\u2019s decision not to grant an evidentiary hearing for abuse of discretion. <em>Id.; see also United States v. Cervantes, </em>132 F.3d 1106, 1110 (5th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b560-6\">When a defendant enters a voluntary guilty plea, all nonjurisdictional defects in the proceedings are waived, including ineffective assistance of counsel, \u201cexcept insofar as the ineffectiveness is alleged to have rendered the guilty plea involuntary.\u201d <em>United States v. Glinsey, </em>209 F.3d 386, 392 (5th Cir.2000). To establish that his counsel was constitutionally ineffective, Samaniego must show that: (1) his counsel\u2019s performance was deficient to the extent that it fell below an objective standard of reasonableness, and (2) the deficient performance prejudiced his defense. <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 687-88, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984). To establish that his counsel\u2019s performance was deficient, Samaniego must show that his counsel made errors so serious that he \u201cwas not functioning as the \u2018counsel\u2019 guaranteed by the Sixth Amendment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 687, 104 S.Ct. 2052. \u201cIn order \u2018[t]o prove prejudice for an ineffective assistance of counsel claim in the context of a guilty plea, the habeas petitioner must show that there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s errors, he would not have pleaded guilty and would have insisted on going to trial.\u2019\u201d <em>Cavitt, </em>550 F.3d at 441 (quoting <em>Bond v. Dretke, </em>384 F.3d 166, 167-68 (5th Cir.2004)). Courts \u201cmust indulge a strong presumption that counsel\u2019s conduct falls within the \"wide range of reasonable professional assistance; that is, the defendant must overcome the presumption that, under the circumstances, the challenged action might be considered sound trial strategy.\u201d <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 689, 104 S.Ct. 2052 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b560-9\">As noted above, Samaniego\u2019s sworn \u00a7 2255 motion alleges that his March 3, 2007 confession was coerced and that before pleading guilty he told his lawyer that the interviewing officers denied his request to speak to an attorney in violation of <em>Miranda v. Arizona, </em>384 U.S. 436, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694 (1966). Samaniego argues that there was no legitimate strategic reason for failing to file a motion to suppress and that by not doing so, his counsel\u2019s performance was objectively unreasonable. Samaniego contends that the March 3, 2007 statements to police were critical to the Government\u2019s case against him and that had a motion to suppress been filed, there is a reasonable probability that he would have proceeded to trial instead of pleading guilty. Samaniego further argues that, given the lack of any response to his \u00a7 2255 motion from his trial counsel, his sworn allegations are unrefuted and the district court erred by not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>granting an evidentiary hearing because the record does not conclusively show that he is not entitled to relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-5\">The Government argues that Samaniego\u2019s \u201cunsupported, self-serving, and after-the-fact claims\u201d of a coerced confession are insufficient to overcome the presumption that his counsel performed reasonably. It notes that before his attorney negotiated a plea agreement, Samaniego was facing the possibility of life imprisonment. With the plea agreement negotiated by counsel, however, Samaniego\u2019s punishment exposure was reduced to 300 months. The Government contends that Samaniego\u2019s counsel \u201cacted reasonably and with sound professional judgment in negotiating a very favorable plea agreement instead of filing a meritless motion to suppress.\u201d The Government also notes that the factual resume accompanying Samaniego\u2019s guilty plea states that when he was arrested on March 3, 2007, San Angelo police officers \u201cinformed Samaniego of his constitutional rights and he agreed to waive those rights and speak with the officers.\u201d It argues that statements made in plea documents carry a strong presumption of veracity and that the statement in Samaniego\u2019s factual resume belies the claims in his \u00a7 2255 motion that his confession was coerced.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-6\">When a prisoner files a \u00a7 2255 motion, the district court must grant an evidentiary hearing \u201c[ujnless the motion and the files and records of the case conclusively show that the prisoner is entitled to no relief.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(b); <em>see also United States v. Bartholomew, </em>974 F.2d 39, 41 (5th Cir.1992) (\u201cA motion brought under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 can be denied without a hearing only if the motion, files, and records of the case conclusively show that the prisoner is entitled to no relief.\u201d). In denying Samaniego\u2019s \u00a7 2255 ineffective assistance claim, the district court found that filing a motion to suppress would have been frivolous and that counsel\u2019s performance was therefore not deficient. The court\u2019s determination, however, was not adequately supported by the record. Given the lack of any factual findings at an evidentiary hearing, or a response from Samaniego\u2019s trial attorney, there is nothing in the record showing counsel\u2019s reasons for not filing a motion to suppress or whether his performance was constitutionally deficient for failing to do so. <em>Cf. United States v. Maria-Martinez, </em>143 F.3d 914, 916 (5th Cir.1998) (\u2018We have held that a claim of ineffective assistance based on a failure to file a motion to suppress cannot be reviewed without testimony as to the reasons behind failing to file the motion.\u201d). As such, the record simply was not sufficiently developed for the district court to evaluate Samaniego\u2019s claim, and this court is similarly unable to evaluate Samaniego\u2019s claim. Indeed, with the current record, this court is essentially in the same position it would have been in had Samaniego raised this claim on direct appeal. <em>See id. </em>(\u201cWe do not typically review claims of ineffective assistance on direct appeal, because the record is rarely sufficiently developed on the issue of counsel\u2019s competence.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b561-9\">While there is obvious tension between Samaniego\u2019s factual resume and the allegations in his \u00a7 2255 motion, the statements are not inherently inconsistent from a factual perspective.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> And given the lack of an evidentiary hearing or any response from Samaniego\u2019s counsel, that tension alone is not sufficient for us to \u201cconclusively\u201d determine that Samaniego is not enti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>tied to relief. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(b). Because the record was not sufficiently developed for the district court to conclusively determine that Samaniego is not entitled to relief, the district court abused its discretion by failing to grant an evidentiary hearing. <em>See Friedman v. United States, </em>588 F.2d 1010, 1015 (5th Cir.1979) (explaining that \u00a7 2255 \u201ccommands the District Courts to grant a prompt hearing on all motions brought pursuant to it [u]n-less the motion and the files and records of the case <em>conclusively </em>show that the prisoner is entitled to no relief.\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b562-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-5\">For the foregoing reasons, we VACATE the district court\u2019s judgment denying Samaniego\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion and REMAND for an evidentiary hearing. Samaniego\u2019s motion to expand the COA is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b558-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b560-7\">. Samaniego also moves this court \"to expand the COA already issued in this cause, to include all of the ineffective assistance of counsel claims presented in the Motion for Certificate of Appealability.\u201d However, Samaniego provides no explanation as to why the COA issued by the court should be expanded. That argument is therefore waived. <em>See Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 224-25 (5th Cir.1993).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b561-7\">. For example, Samaniego\u2019s factual resume states that the \"officers informed [him] of his constitutional rights and he agreed to waive those rights and speak with the officers.\" In his sworn \u00a7 2255 motion, Samaniego alleges that he requested an attorney and his request was denied. It is at least possible that Samaniego was informed of his rights, requested <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>a lawyer and was denied, and then agreed to waive his rights and speak with the officers.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
