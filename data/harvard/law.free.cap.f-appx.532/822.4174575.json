BACHARACH, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b848-16\">In federal district court, Mr. Monterial Wesley was convicted of: (1) conspiracy to manufacture and possess cocaine and cocaine base with the intent to distribute, and (2) use of a telephone to facilitate a drug transaction. After unsuccessfully asking the district court to vacate the sentence under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255, Mr. Wesley appeals. We can only entertain the appeal if Mr. Wesley is entitled to a certificate of appealability. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(1)(B) (2006). Holding that he is not entitled to this certificate, we dismiss the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-17\">\n<em>Standard for Certificate of Appealability</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b848-18\">To obtain a certificate of appealability, Mr. Wesley must make \u201ca substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2) (2006). For this showing, Mr. Wesley must demonstrate that \u201creasonable jurists could debate whether (or, for that matter, agree that) the petition should have been resolved in a different manner or that the issues presented were \u2018adequate to deserve encouragement to proceed further.\u2019 \u201d <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b848-19\">\n<em>Mr. Wesley\u2019s Appellate Arguments</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b848-20\">Mr. Wesley applies for a certificate of appealability on three grounds: (1) His sentence was based on clearly erroneous facts; (2) the district court usurped the role of the jury in making witness credibility determinations; and (3) the prosecution\u2019s evidence lacked indicia of reliability.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-21\">Mr. Wesley did not raise any of these issues in the motion that he filed in district court. R. vol. 1, at 69-80 (Mr. Wesley\u2019s 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion); R. vol. 1, at 81-113 (Mr. Wesley\u2019s brief in support of his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion). Because these issues are presented for the first time on appeal, they cannot justify a certificate of appealability. <em>See United States v. Viera, </em>674 F.3d 1214, 1220 (10th Cir.2012) (absent extraordinary circumstances, this Court will not consider arguments for a certificate of appealability that are raised for the first time in an appeal).</p>\n<p id=\"b848-22\">\n<em>Conclusion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b848-23\">Because we cannot entertain Mr. Wesley\u2019s new appellate arguments, we cannot issue a certificate of appealability. And <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"823\">*823</page-number>without a certificate of appealability, we must dismiss the appeal.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b848-24\"> This order does not constitute precedent. <em>See </em>10th Cir. R. 32.1(A).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
