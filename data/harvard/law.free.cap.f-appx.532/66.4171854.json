Plaintiff-appellee American Board of Surgery, Inc. (ABS) challenges our jurisdiction and requests that we dismiss this appeal. For the following reasons, we will exercise jurisdiction and summarily affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-7\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-8\">ABS sued Lasko in 2010, alleging that he had engaged in unfair and deceptive trade practices by creating corporate shells with names similar to other, respected medical organizations, for the purpose of selling illegitimate certifications and memberships under the names of those groups. ABS eventually moved for sanctions in the form of a default judgment, as Lasko had, inter alia, flouted his discovery obligations \u2014 in one instance, by failing to appear for a previously scheduled deposition at significant expense to ABS.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-9\">Agreeing that sanctions were warranted, the District Court granted a default judgment in favor of ABS, awarding damages and attorney fees. Also, pursuant to the Lanham Act (15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1116(a)), the District Court enjoined Lasko from a) using \u201cany and all of an enumerated list of organization names; b) using three specified websites; c) selling status-related privileges \u201crelated to any purported medical organization including, <em>but not limited to </em>\u201d the organizations previously listed; and d) soliciting \u201ccertificates, use of letters, membership, or diplomat, fellow, or board of director status related to any purported medical organization including, <em>but not limited to </em>\u201d the organizations previously listed. <em>See </em>Order 5-8, ECF No. 46 (emphasis added). The District Court also entered judgment in favor of ABS.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-10\">About a year and a half later, ABS filed a motion for civil contempt, alleging that Lasko continued \u201cto engage in the exact same unlawful conduct.\u201d Mem. of Law 1, ECF No. 48. ABS attached to its motion a letter from an organization called the \u201cNational Academy of Medicine,\u201d which was \u201cstrikingly similar to [materials] previously used by Lasko in connection with ... the ... entities identified in the Court\u2019s Order.\u201d Mem. of Law. 4 \u2014 5; <em>see also </em>Ex. C, ECF No. 48-1.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-11\">The District Court held a hearing on the contempt motion, at which Lasko appeared pro se. ABS explained that while the injunction did not prohibit the use of the name \u201cNational Academy of Medicine,\u201d it did prohibit, among other things, the \u201cuse of letters\u201d in connection with \u201cany purported medical organization.\u201d Tr. 8:24-9:5. Lasko conceded that he had received the District Court\u2019s final order, <em>see </em>Tr. 15:2-4, and did not dispute that he created the National Academy of Medicine, <em>see </em>Tr. 16:10-16. He further essentially admitted to sending the letters in question. Tr. 20:6-8. Throughout, Lasko insisted that his conduct was covered under the religious protections of the First Amendment. <em>See, e.g., </em>Tr. 41:19-24 (\u201cTHE COURT: So your position is that the first amendment, freedom of religion ... allows you to send these letters? Is that your position? MR. LASKO: Yes, it is.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b93-12\">Having taken testimony, the District Court asked ABS to clarify what it was requesting from the Court. Tr. 47: 6-9. In addition to fees and other sanctions, ABS asked for the Court to issue a more specific directive covering the National Academy of Medicine and other organizations Lasko had begun to use since judgment was entered. <em>See </em>Tr. 47:18-48:3.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-13\">Ultimately, the District Court found Lasko in contempt and enjoined him from \u201cus[ing] ... the names National Academy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>of Medicine, American Institute of Geriatrics, National Academy of Dental Sciences, American Academy of Dental Sciences and United States Academy of Dental Sciences for any purpose.\u201d Order \u00b6 3, EOF No. 54; <em>see also </em>Tr. 51:6-9 (finding Lasko\u2019s conduct to be \u201cclearly, definitively and one hundred percent\u201d prohibited by the original injunction). The District Court declined to levy sanctions \u201cat this time,\u201d but allowed ABS to present \u201cevidence of further violations of the Court\u2019s orders\u201d within a six-month time frame, at which point a \u201chearing\u201d would be convened \u201cto determine the appropriate penalty.\u201d Order \u00b6 4; <em>see also </em>Tr. 55:19-24 (announcing an intent to \u201cmaintain[ ] jurisdiction\u201d over the matter of sanctions). Lasko filed a timely notice of appeal.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b94-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-5\">In its summary-action response, ABS suggests that we lack jurisdiction over this appeal. We must determine our own jurisdiction before reaching the merits of the case. <em>See Elliott v. Archdiocese of N.Y., </em>682 F.3d 213, 219 (3d Cir.2012) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b94-6\">ABS argues that the contempt order is not final under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 because it did not impose sanctions and \u201ckept the matter open for six months.\u201d Thus, according to ABS, \u201cthe Order from which Mr. Lasko seeks to appeal is a non-appeal-able interlocutory order, which this Court lacks jurisdiction to review.\u201d Resp. 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-7\">A post-judgment civil contempt order is considered a final, immediately appealable order under \u00a7 1291 once a finding of contempt is made and a sanction imposed. <em>See United States v. Gonzales, </em>531 F.3d 1198, 1202 (10th Cir.2008) (collecting cases); <em>see also U.S. Steel Corp. v. Fraternal Ass\u2019n of Steel Haulers, </em>601 F.2d 1269, 1273 (3d Cir.1979). Having found Lasko in contempt, the District Court explicitly retained jurisdiction to make a future determination of sanctions, but not necessarily a redetermination of contempt, if Lasko persisted in violating the permanent injunction. We are in accord with ABS that the District Court\u2019s order lacks the \u201celements of operativeness and consequence necessary\u201d to be a final decision under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, precluding an exercise of jurisdiction under that section. <em>Consumers Gas &amp; Oil v. Farmland Indus., </em>84 F.3d 367, 370 (10th Cir.1996) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b94-10\">However, certain nonfinal interlocutory orders, such as those modifying injunctions, are appealable pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292(a)(1). Also, \u201cone who is a party may appeal from a civil contempt order in connection with some other appealable order.\u201d <em>United States v. Spectro Foods Corp., </em>544 F.2d 1175, 1179 (3d Cir.1976). Moreover, \u201c[ojnce vested with section 1292(a)(1) jurisdiction, we may also review the district court\u2019s finding of civil contempt.\u201d <em>Int\u2019l Bhd. of Teamsters, Warehousemen &amp; Helpers of Am., Local 219 v. W. Pa. Motor Carriers Ass\u2019n, </em>660 F.2d 76, 81 (3d Cir.1981) (citing <em>Spectro Foods, </em>544 F.2d at 1179). We must therefore determine whether the District Court\u2019s contempt order contains elements that would bring it within the ambit of \u00a7 1292(a)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b94-11\">\u201cFor an interlocutory order to be appealable under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292(a)(1) ... as an order modifying an injunction, two requirements appear to be necessary and must be satisfied: (i) the original or prior <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>order must have been injunctive in character, and (ii) that injunction must have been modified in some respect by the order from which the appeal has been taken.\u201d <em>Hoots v. Pennsylvania, </em>587 F.2d 1340, 1348 (3d Cir.1978). An injunction is \u201caffirmatively defined as follows: [ojrders that are directed to a party, enforceable by contempt, and designed to accord or protect some or all of the substantive relief sought by a complaint in more than a temporary fashion.\u201d <em>Cohen v. Bd. of Trustees, </em>867 F.2d 1455, 1465 n. 9 (3d Cir.1989) (en banc) (internal quotation marks, alterations, and citation omitted). We construe appealability pursuant to \u00a7 1292 narrowly, <em>see N.J. State Nurses Ass\u2019n v. Treacy, </em>834 F.2d 67, 70-71 (3d Cir.1987), and must pay special attention to the distinction between a \u201cmodification\u201d of an injunction, which is appealable, and the clarification of one, which is not. <em>See Entegris, Inc. v. Pall Corp., </em>490 F.3d 1340, 1345 (Fed.Cir.2007). In so doing, we must \u201cexamine the substance of the order rather than merely its language.\u201d <em>U.S. Fire Ins. Co. v. Asbestospray, Inc., </em>182 F.3d 201, 207 (3d Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b95-5\">We conclude that the District Court\u2019s contempt order qualified, in part, as a \u201cmodification\u201d of a permanent injunction, and is thus appealable under \u00a7 1292(a)(1). The original order granted a Lanham Act injunction consisting of two categories of restrictions: exhaustive, closed lists of names and websites that Lasko could not \u201cuse\u201d; and nonexhaustive, illustrative lists of \u201cpurported medical organization[s]\u201d on whose behalf Lasko was prohibited from soliciting and marketing. The contempt order added five names to the previously exhaustive list of organizations whose monikers and operations were forbidden to be used for any purpose. This changed the character of the injunction. For example, while solicitation on behalf of the \u201cNational Academy of Dental Sciences\u201d would fall under the terms of the original permanent injunction, merely using the name would not. Under the contempt order\u2019s modification, however, use itself would be prohibited. By expanding the scope of the permanent injunction, the District Court \u201cmodified\u201d it within the meaning of \u00a7 1292(a)(1) and our prior case law, rendering the contempt order appealable.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-8\">Therefore, we will exercise jurisdiction over the contempt order pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292(a)(1), and must therefore deny ABS\u2019s submission to the extent that it was a motion to dismiss.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Both the modification of an injunctive decree and a finding of civil contempt are reviewed for abuse of discretion. Lone <em>Star Steakhouse &amp; Saloon v. Longhorn Steaks, </em>106 F.3d 355, 364 (11th Cir.1997) (citation omitted); <em>Harris v. City of Phila., </em>47 F.3d 1311, 1321 (3d Cir.1995). Our jurisdiction does not otherwise extend to \u201cthe merits of the underlying [permanent injunction or judgment],\u201d which \u201cmay not be called into question in a post-judgment civil contempt proceeding.\u201d <em>Halderman v. Pennhurst State Sch. &amp; Hosp., </em>673 F.2d 628, 637 (3d Cir.1982) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b95-9\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-10\">We consider first the finding of civil contempt itself, which must be supported by clear and convincing evidence but will otherwise \u201conly be disturbed if there is an error of law or a clearly erroneous finding of fact.\u201d <em>Harris, </em>47 F.3d at 1321. \u201cTo prove civil contempt the court must find that (1) a valid court order existed, (2) the defendant had knowledge of the order, and (3) the defendant disobeyed the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>order.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1326 (citing <em>Roe v. Operation Rescue, </em>919 F.2d 857, 871 (3d Cir. 1990)). \u201c[G]ood faith is not a defense to civil contempt.\u201d <em>Robin Woods Inc. v. Woods, </em>28 F.3d 396, 399 (3d Cir.1994). However, ambiguities in an order are construed in favor the charged party. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b96-4\">As discussed above, Lasko admitted knowledge of the permanent injunction and had not otherwise challenged its validity. His arguments before the District Court (which he repeats on appeal) amounted to reliance on the allegedly religious character of his solicitations, which he maintained should carve out an exception for his conduct under the Constitution. He failed to explain, however, how religious character was relevant. To the contrary, ABS showed that, following his being enjoined by the District Court, Lasko sent out a solicitation under the name \u201cNational Academy of Medicine\u201d that mimicked precisely the conduct to which the ABS originally objected: questionable representation as a \u201cmedical organization\u201d with a conspicuous element of remuneration from the honorary titles and degrees allegedly bestowed. The July 21, 2012 letter informed the recipient of his candidacy for an alleged \u201caward\u201d that would elevate him to the \u201cScientific Advisory Board\u201d of the \u201cNational Academy of Medicine\u201d \u2014 for a fe\u00e9, of course. This communication falls squarely within the conduct prohibited by the permanent injunction, and took place after the District Court enjoined Lasko. Hence, the District Court did not err in finding Lasko to be in contempt.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-5\">Next, we consider whether the modification of the injunction \u201ceffectuate[d] or thwart[ed] the purpose behind the permanent injunction.\u201d <em>Sierra Club v. U.S. Army Corps of Eng\u2019rs, </em>732 F.2d 253, 257 (2d Cir.1984). Although modification of the injunction was arguably unnecessary (as the District Court itself remarked during the contempt hearing) to prevent any further misconduct, the District Court has broad discretion in fashioning a remedy. <em>Woods, </em>28 F.3d at 399 (citation omitted). On the present record, and especially given the character of the unchallenged, original permanent injunction, we cannot say that the addition of five more shell companies amounted to an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-7\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-8\">For the foregoing reasons, we find no substantial question to be presented by this appeal, and will summarily affirm the District Court\u2019s judgment. <em>See Murray v. Bledsoe, </em>650 F.3d 246, 248 (3d Cir.2011) (per curiam); <em>see also </em>3d Cir. L.A.R. 27.4; 3d Cir. I.O.P. 10.6. To the extent that Lasko\u2019s submissions request independent relief, they are denied.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b94-8\">. The notice of appeal is timely filed from the order granting ABS\u2019s motion for civil contempt. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(1)(A). It is not timely filed in relation to the District Court\u2019s original default judgment order, despite the Court's noncompliance with Fed.R.Civ.P. 58. Thus, we lack jurisdiction over the default judgment and original permanent injunction.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b95-6\">. Because we can exercise jurisdiction under \u00a7 1292(a)(1), we need not reach whether the collateral order doctrine also would permit this appeal. <em>See Asbestospray, </em>182 F.3d at 207-08.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
