Ellis, a state prisoner proceeding pro se, seeks a certificate of appealability (COA) to appeal the district court\u2019s dismissal of his second 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 habeas petition for lack of jurisdiction. We deny a COA and dismiss the matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-16\">Mr. Ellis was convicted of two counts each of rape in the first degree, lewd molestation, and preparing child pornography. He was sentenced to a 75-year term of imprisonment for each of the rape convictions, a 20-year term of imprisonment for each of the lewd molestation convictions, and a 10-year term of imprisonment for each child pornography conviction. In October 2007, the Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals affirmed the convictions and sentences, except it reversed the conviction on one count of preparing child pornography. Mr. Ellis sought post-conviction relief in state court, but it was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-19\">In April 2010, Mr. Ellis filed his first \u00a7 2254 habeas petition challenging his convictions. The district court dismissed the petition with prejudice as time-barred because it was filed outside of the one-year statute of limitations, and we denied Mr. Ellis\u2019s request for a COA. <em>See Ellis v. Parker, </em>426 Fed.Appx. 683, <em>683-84 </em>(10th Cir.2011), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 132 S.Ct. 1011, 181 L.Ed.2d 748 (2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b852-22\">In May 2013, Mr. Ellis filed a second \u00a7 2254 habeas petition. The district court determined that this petition was an unauthorized second or successive petition and dismissed it for lack of jurisdiction. Mr. Ellis now seeks a COA to appeal that dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-23\">To obtain a COA, Mr. Ellis must show that \u201cjurists of reason would find it debatable whether the petition states a valid claim of the denial of a constitutional right and that jurists of reason would find it debatable whether the district court was correct in its procedural ruling.\u201d <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b852-24\">A prisoner may not file a second or successive \u00a7 2254 habeas petition unless he first obtains an order from the circuit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"827\">*827</page-number>court authorizing the district court to consider the petition. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(b)(3)(A). In the absence of such authorization, a district court lacks jurisdiction to address the merits of a second or successive \u00a7 2254 habeas petition. <em>See In re Cline, </em>531 F.3d 1249, 1251 (10th Cir.2008) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b853-5\">Mr. Ellis\u2019s new \u00a7 2254 habeas petition seeks to bring claims of ineffective assistance of trial and appellate counsel. Mr. Ellis\u2019s first \u00a7 2254 habeas petition brought claims attacking the same conviction that he now seeks to challenge in his second \u00a7 2254 habeas petition. Even though his first \u00a7 2254 habeas petition was dismissed as time-barred, that determination still counts as \u201ca decision on the merits, and any later habeas petition challenging the same conviction is second or successive and is subject to the AEDPA requirements.\u201d <em>In re Rains, </em>659 F.3d 1274, 1275 (10th Cir.2011) (per curiam). The district court therefore properly characterized Mr. Ellis\u2019s new petition as a second or successive \u00a7 2254 habeas petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-6\">Reasonable jurists could not debate that the district court was correct to treat Mr. Ellis\u2019s new petition as an unauthorized second or successive \u00a7 2254 habeas petition and to dismiss it for lack of jurisdiction. Accordingly, we deny a COA and dismiss this matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-7\">We deny Mr. Ellis\u2019s motion for appointment of counsel as moot. We grant Mr. Ellis\u2019s motion for leave to proceed on appeal without prepayment of costs or fees.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b852-17\"> This order is not binding precedent except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. It may be cited, however, for its persuasive value consistent with Fed. R.App. P. 32.1 and 10th Cir. R. 32.1.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
