The District Court denied Desrosiers\u2019 petition, holding that he was subject to mandatory detention under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1226(c). Desrosiers appeals, arguing that mandatory detention under \u00a7 1226(c) is not applicable because he received a noncustodial sentence, was not detained when released, and received a stay of removal. We will affirm the District Court\u2019s denial of Desrosiers\u2019 petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-5\">Because we write primarily for the parties, we discuss the facts only to the extent necessary for our resolution of the issues raised on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-6\">Appellant Robert Desrosiers is a native and citizen of Haiti who became a permanent resident of the United States in 1992. In October 2006, Desrosiers was arrested on charges of assisting in the preparation of false tax returns and was released on bond. He subsequently pled guilty and was sentenced to three years probation on June 11, 2009. Just over two years later, Desrosiers was arrested and taken into custody by ICE, and charged with removability for having been convicted of an aggravated felony. On August 8, 2011, an Immigration Judge held that Desrosiers was subject to detention under the immigration law\u2019s mandatory detention provision. Desrosiers was later found to be removable, and in June 2012, we granted Desrosiers\u2019 request for a stay of removal pending review of the removal proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-7\">Meanwhile, on August 11, 2011, Desrosiers filed this petition for a writ of habeas corpus, arguing that the mandatory detention provision of the immigration law did not apply to him. He contends that the immigration statute\u2019s provision addressing mandatory detention requires that ICE detain an alien at the precise moment of his or her release. Because Desrosiers was released on bond after his arrest and later sentenced to probation, Desrosiers contends that he was not eligible for mandatory detention. The District Court denied the petition, finding the statute was ambiguous and deferring to the Board of Immigration Appeal\u2019s (\u201cBIA\u201d) interpretation that mandatory detention does not require immediacy. App. 4-6 (citing <em>In re Rojas, </em>23 I. &amp; N. Dec. 117 (BIA 2001)). Desrosiers timely appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-9\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-10\">The District Court had jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241. We have jurisdiction over this appeal from the District Court\u2019s denial of the petition under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We exercise plenary review over the denial of habeas corpus relief. <em>Vega v. United States, </em>493 F.3d 310, 314 (3d Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b310-11\">Section 1226(a) provides the Attorney General with the discretionary authority to detain an alien \u201cpending a decision on whether the alien is to be removed from the United States.\u201d Such individuals are eligible for a bond hearing. Under \u00a7 1226(c), however, other individuals are subject to mandatory detention pending removal proceedings, without the opportunity for a bond hearing. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1226(c) (\u201cThe Attorney General <em>shall </em>take into custody any alien who [has committed enumerated offenses, including an aggravated felony] <em>when the alien is released, </em>without regard to whether the alien is released on parole, supervised release, or probation....\u201d) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b310-12\">Desrosiers argues that he is not subject to mandatory detention under \u00a7 1226(c) because ICE did not immediately detain him until over two years after he was released on probation in 2009. For that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>reason, he contends, \u00a7 1226(a) governs his custody and he is eligible for a bond hearing to evaluate whether detention is necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-5\">We have recently addressed this precise issue in <em>Sylvain v. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>714 F.3d 150 (3d Cir.2013). There, the petitioner was detained by ICE, without a bond hearing, four years after he pled guilty and was conditionally discharged without any term of imprisonment or probation. We held that immigration officials do not lose their authority to impose mandatory detention under \u00a7 1226(c) if the government fails to immediately detain the alien upon his or her release from state or federal custody. <em>Sylvain, </em>714 F.3d at 152. In <em>Sylvain, </em>contrary to the District Court in this action, we indicated that we did not need to determine whether the law was ambiguous or whether to defer to the BIA\u2019s interpretation in <em>Rojas. Id. </em>at 156-57. In so concluding, we stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b311-6\">Our holding rests on a simple observation: even if the statute calls for detention \u201cwhen the alien is released,\u201d and even if \u201cwhen\u201d implies some period of less than four years, nothing in the statute suggests that officials lose authority if they delay---- [A]s the Supreme Court has explained in a related context, \u201c[t]he end of exacting compliance with the letter of [the statute] cannot justify the means of exposing the public to an increased likelihood of violent crime by persons on bail, an evil the statute aims to prevent.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b311-9\"><em>Id. </em>at 160 (quoting <em>United States v. Montalvo-Murillo, </em>495 U.S. 711, 720, 110 S.Ct. 2072, 109 L.Ed.2d 720 (1990)). Our holding in <em>Sylvain </em>effectively disposes of Desrosiers\u2019 claim for habeas corpus relief based on the timing of his apprehension by ICE.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-12\">In an attempt to pull this case from the grasp of <em>Sylvain, </em>Desrosiers claims that under <em>Leslie v. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>678 F.3d 265 (3d Cir.2012), the authority to detain him reverts from \u00a7 1226(c) to \u00a7 1226(a) following a grant of a stay of removal. However, Desrosiers\u2019 reliance on <em>Leslie </em>is unavailing. In <em>Leslie, </em>we held that the petitioner remained subject to detention under \u00a7 1226<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> during a stay of removal. 678 F.3d at 270. After being continuously detained for nearly four years, we found his detention to be \u201cunreasonably long\u201d and granted a bond hearing to provide Leslie with an \u201cindividualized inquiry into whether detention [was] still necessary to fulfill the statute\u2019s purposes.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 270-71 (quoting <em>Diop v. ICE/Homeland Sec., </em>656 F.3d 221, 231 (3d Cir.2011)). We never stated in <em>Leslie </em>that our grant of a bond hearing turned on our earlier grant of a stay of removal. If we meant to suggest, as Desrosiers claims, that detention reverts to \u00a7 1226(a) after a stay of removal has been granted, our analysis under Diop\u2019s reasonableness of detention standard would have been unnecessary. Desrosiers\u2019 attempt to read such an outcome into <em>Leslie </em>is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-13\">Finally, Desrosiers claims he is not subject to mandatory detention because he was sentenced to probation and not to a term of imprisonment and thus was never \u201creleased\u201d from custody. Section 1226(c) directs that an individual be taken into custody \u201cwhen ... released, without regard to whether the alien is released on parole, supervised release, or probation .... \u201d This language clearly contemplates convictions resulting in probationary sentences. In <em>Sylvain, </em>we recognized the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>BIA\u2019s interpretation in earlier cases that release following arrest can satisfy the release requirement, noting that Sylvain\u2019s release from arrest and conviction \u201ccertainly fulfilled the release requirement.\u201d 714 F.3d at 160; <em>see also In re West, </em>22 I. &amp; N. Dec. 1405, 1410 (BIA 2000) (reasoning that \u201c\u2018[r]eleased\u2019 in this context can also refer to release from physical custody following arrest\u201d when the respondent was arrested and released on bond). Furthermore, the imposition of Desrosiers\u2019 probationary sentence and termination of bond also constituted a \u201crelease\u201d from custody. <em>See Hensley v. Mun. Ct., </em>411 U.S. 345, 351, 93 S.Ct. 1571, 36 L.Ed.2d 294 (1973) (noting that the petitioner, who was released on his own recognizance, was \u201cin custody\u201d for the purpose of habeas review because he was obligated to appear whenever ordered by the court and could not \u201ccome and go as he please[d]\u201d). Because Desrosiers\u2019 freedom of movement was restricted and he was obligated to appear, he remained \u201cin custody\u201d until sentenced and released on probation. Because release from his pre-conviction arrest and release from bond into probation both fulfill the \u00a7 1226(c) release requirement, we hold that Desrosiers is subject to the mandatory detention provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-5\">For the reasons stated above, we conclude that Desrosiers is subject to mandatory detention. Accordingly, we will affirm the judgment of the District Court denying Desrosiers\u2019 petition.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b311-10\">. While we did not specify which subsection Leslie was originally detained under, presumably he was subject to mandatory detention under \u00a7 1226(c) due to his previous conviction for an aggravated felony. <em>See Leslie, </em>678 F.3d at 267.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
