He alleged that Wells Fargo did not respond to a single request for information about a small business loan, and that Bank of America 1) sent him information about a line of credit instead of a loan, and 2) that it did not respond to his application for a line of credit. His amended complaint alleged that branch employees at both banks misinformed him about the minimum amount of revenue required to be eligible for a small business loan. Abdullah alleged that these actions were the equivalent of being denied the opportunity to apply for a loan program for which he was otherwise qualified. He also alleged that absent another explanation from the defendants, he \u201ccan only conclude one purpose for this misinformation and denial, discrimination.\u201d Acting prior to service under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii), the District Court dismissed the amended complaint for failure to state a claim. It also denied leave to further amend as futile.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-11\">We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We exercise plenary review over the District Court\u2019s dismissal for failure to state a claim. <em>See Lazaridis v. Wehmer, </em>591 F.3d 666, 670 (3d Cir.2010) (per curiam). Dismissal is appropriate where the pleader has not alleged \u201csufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to state a claim that is plausible on its face.\u201d <em>Ashcroft v. Iqbal, </em>556 U.S. 662, 678, 129 S.Ct. 1937, 173 L.Ed.2d 868 (2009). The standard requires a two-part analysis, first separating the complaint\u2019s factual allegations from its legal conclusions, and second, taking only the factual allegations as true, deciding whether the plaintiff has alleged a plausible claim for relief. See <em>Fowler v. UPMC Shadyside, </em>578 F.3d 203, 210-11 (3d Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b116-12\">To state a claim for violation of \u00a7 1981, a plaintiff must allege that 1) he is a member of a racial minority; 2) the defendant intentionally discriminated against the plaintiff on the basis of race; and 3) the discrimination negatively affected his ability to engage in one of the protected activities, including formation of a contract. <em>Brown v. Philip Morris, Inc., </em>250 F.3d 789, 797 (3d Cir.2001).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> To state a claim for violation of \u00a7 2000d, a plaintiff must allege 1) intentional discrimination on the basis of race or national origin 2) by a program receiving federal funds.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In either context, the standard for alleging intentional discrimination is the same. <em>See Pryor v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number><em>National Collegiate Athletic Ass\u2019n, </em>288 F.3d 548, 569 (3d Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b117-5\">Here, appellant alleged that the only explanation for the appellees\u2019 conduct was racial discrimination, but that is a legal conclusion not entitled to be assumed true. <em>See Iqbal, </em>556 U.S. at 681, 129 S.Ct. 1937 (holding that allegation in complaint that conduct was motivated \u201csolely on account of religion, race, and/or national origin\u201d was conclusory and \u201cnot entitled to be assumed true.\u201d) (citation omitted). Appellant failed to allege any facts supporting this conclusion. <em>See Sarullo v. U.S. Postal Service, </em>352 F.3d 789, 798 (3d Cir.2003) (per curiam) (holding plaintiff in racial discrimination claim must \u201cestablish some causal nexus between his membership in a protected class and\u201d the adverse action). In his argument in support of this appeal, Abdullah alleged for the first time that he is African-American, that the relevant actors from the banks are Caucasian, and that the banks are aware of his race. Even if these facts had been contained in his complaint, they would be the only facts from which to draw an inference of racial animus. That the plaintiff and defendant are different races is not sufficient to plausibly state a claim of racial discrimination. <em>See Santiago v. Warminster Twp., </em>629 F.3d 121, 133 (3d Cir.2010) (\u201cAllegations that are merely consistent with a defendant\u2019s liability or show the mere possibility of misconduct are not enough.\u201d) (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b117-6\">The District Court dismissed Abdullah\u2019s original complaint for substantially the same reasons we have identified and gave appellant an opportunity to amend. <em>See Grayson v. Mayview State Hosp., </em>293 F.3d 103, 114 (3d Cir.2002). His amended complaint did not correct the deficiencies identified by the District Court. In these circumstances, we conclude that the District Court need not have extended further leave to amend. <em>See Hill v. City of Scranton, </em>411 F.3d 118, 134 (3d Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b117-8\">For the reasons given, we will summarily affirm the judgment of the District Court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b116-7\">. The District Court liberally construed appellant\u2019s amended complaint as including claims under both statutes. The complaint actually only cited to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000d.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b116-8\">. Because it does not change our analysis, we do not analyze whether the test for a claim of racially discriminatory lending applies, as in either case the complaint's deficiency in alleging racial discrimination would be fatal. <em>See Anderson v. Wachovia Mortg. Corp., </em>621 F.3d 261, 275 (3d Cir.2010).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b116-14\">. We note that the District Court did not analyze, nor do we, whether the federally guaranteed loan program at issue here brings the defendants within the ambit of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000d. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000d-4a.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
