A077 660 310, A079 306 964 (B.I.A. May 25, 2012). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-16\">We review the BIA\u2019s denial of a motion to reopen for abuse of discretion, mindful of the Supreme Court\u2019s admonition that such motions are \u201cdisfavored.\u201d <em>Ali v. Gonzales, </em>448 F.3d 515, 517 (2d Cir.2006) (citing <em>INS v. Doherty, </em>502 U.S. 314, 322-23, 112 S.Ct. 719, 116 L.Ed.2d 823 (1992)). When the BIA considers relevant evidence of country conditions in evaluating a motion to reopen, we review the BIA\u2019s factual findings under the substantial evidence standard. <em>See Shao v. Mukasey, </em>546 F.3d 138, 169 (2d Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b40-17\">The BIA did not err in denying Lian and Zheng\u2019s motion to reopen as untimely and number-barred. Aliens may file only one motion to reopen within 90 days of the agency\u2019s final administrative decision. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(7)(A), (C)(i); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(2). Athough their motion was indisputably untimely and number-barred because it was filed more than six years after the agency\u2019s final order of removal and it was their third such motion, <em>see 8 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(7)(A), (C)(i), there are no time or numerical limitations for filing a motion to reopen if it is \u201cbased on changed country conditions arising in the country of nationality or the country to which removal has been ordered, if such evidence is material and was not available and would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>not have been discovered or presented at the previous proceeding.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(7)(C)(ii); <em>see also </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(3)(ii).</p>\n<p id=\"b41-5\">The BIA did not err in concluding that Lian\u2019s newly commenced Falun Gong practice constituted a change in her personal circumstances rather than a change in country conditions sufficient to excuse the applicable limitations. <em>See Zheng v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>416 F.3d 129, 130-31 (2d Cir.2005); <em>see also Yuen Jin v. Mukasey, </em>538 F.3d 143, 155 (2d Cir.2008). Moreover, the BIA reasonably found that Lian and Zheng\u2019s evidence did not demonstrate a material change in country conditions because that evidence did not indicate that conditions had worsened for Falun Gong practitioners in China since the time of their hearing before the IJ. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(e)(7)(C)(ii); <em>see also Shao, </em>546 F.3d at 169-72. Accordingly, the BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying Lian and Zheng\u2019s motion to reopen as untimely and number-barred. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(7)(A), (C).</p>\n<p id=\"b41-6\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED. As we have completed our review, any stay of removal that the Court previously granted in this petition is VACATED, and any pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DISMISSED as moot. Any pending request for oral argument in this petition is DENIED in accordance with Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 34(a)(2), and Second Circuit Local Rule 34.1(b).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
