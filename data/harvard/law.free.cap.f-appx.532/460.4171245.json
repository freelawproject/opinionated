Meza argues that it was error for the district court to rely on his rehabilitation needs for a residential drug treatment program to impose or lengthen his sentence. He asserts that 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3852(a) prohibits a sentencing court from considering a defendant\u2019s rehabilitation needs when imposing or increasing a sentence, and that this prohibition applies to sentences imposed upon revocation of supervised release, relying on <em>Tapia v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 131 S.Ct. 2382, 2393, 180 L.Ed.2d 357 (2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b486-24\">Because Meza did not object to the reasonableness of his sentence after it was imposed or to any specific error, our review is limited to plain error. <em>See United States v. Whitelaw, </em>580 F.3d 256, 259-60 (5th Cir.2009). To succeed on plain-error review, Meza must show a clear or obvious forfeited error that affected his substantial rights. <em>See Puckett v. United States, </em>556 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>U.S. 129, 135, 129 S.Ct. 1423, 173 L.Ed.2d 266 (2009). This court has discretion to correct the error only if it \u201cseriously affect[s] the fairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 736, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993) (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b487-5\">The record reflects that the district court chose the thirty-month sentence so that Meza would have an opportunity to participate in a drug treatment program. The law at the time of Meza\u2019s sentencing was unclear, but while his direct appeal was pending, the Supreme Court issued its decision in <em>Tapia, </em>holding that a district court may not impose or lengthen a sentence for rehabilitation purposes. <em>See </em>131 S.Ct. at 2393.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> This court recently held that <em>Tapia </em>applies to the revocation context. <em>United States v. Garza, </em>706 F.3d 655, 656-58 (5th Cir.2013). Section 3852(a), therefore, precludes a court from lengthening a revocation sentence based on the defendant\u2019s rehabilitative needs. <em>Id. </em>Accordingly, in view of <em>Tapia </em>and <em>Garza, </em>it was error for the district court to consider Meza\u2019s need to participate in a drug treatment program in determining the length of his sentence. <em>Tapia, </em>131 S.Ct. at 2393; <em>Garza, </em>706 F.3d 655, 2013 WL 398760, at *1. Although this court had not definitively answered whether \u00a7 3852(a) applies in the revocation context until <em>Garza, </em>this error now is clear or obvious. <em>See Garza, </em>706 F.3d at 662-63 (concluding that such error \u201cwas clear or obvious by the time of the appeal\u201d); <em>United States v. Escalante-Reyes, </em>689 F.3d 415, 419-24 (5th Cir.2012) (en banc) (holding that the plainness of an error is to be determined at the time of appeal).</p>\n<p id=\"b487-7\">We now turn to the third prong of plain error \u2014 whether the error affected Meza\u2019s substantial rights. The record reflects that the district court, in explaining Meza\u2019s sentence, focused on the need for the sentence to allow Meza sufficient time to participate in a drug treatment program. Specifically, the district court explained that \u201cI will recommend that you be given an opportunity to participate in the Comprehensive Drug Treatment Program in the penitentiary. And [it is] necessary for me to give you a sentence of approximately that length in order to be sure you have an opportunity to participate in that.\u201d Because the district court\u2019s emphasis on the correlation between Meza\u2019s sentence and the time necessary to complete a drug treatment program is \u201csufficient to undermine our confidence that the district court would have imposed the same sentence absent the error,\u201d we conclude that the error affected Meza\u2019s substantial rights. <em>See Escalante-Reyes, </em>689 F.3d at 425; <em>see also Garza, </em>706 F.3d at 662.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-8\">Under the final prong of plain-error review, we retain the discretion to remedy the error \u201conly if the error \u2018seriously affect[s] the fairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u2019 \u201d <em>Puckett, </em>556 U.S. at 135, 129 S.Ct. 1423 (alteration in original) (quoting <em>Olano, </em>507 U.S. at 736, 113 S.Ct. 1770). Even if we conclude that the other three prongs are met, we do not automatically assume that the final prong is satisfied. <em>See, e.g., Escalante-Reyes, </em>689 F.3d at 425. We turn to the particular facts of this case. At his revocation hearing, Meza admitted to the following violations of the conditions of supervised release: (1) using and possessing methamphetamine, an illegal controlled <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>substance; (2) failing to report to the probation office on January 5, 2011, as instructed; (3) failing to attend a drug counseling session on April 5, 2011, as instructed; (4) failing to provide a urine specimen on April 2, 2011, as instructed; (5) failing to make monthly restitution payments on numerous occasions; and (6) submitting a monthly report in March 2011 that contained untruthful statements regarding his employment. Under the advisory policy statements in Chapter 7 of the United States Sentencing Guidelines (\u201cU.S.S.G.\u201d), Meza\u2019s criminal history category of II and his Grade C violations of the conditions of supervised release yielded an advisory range of imprisonment of 4 to 10 months. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 7B1.4.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-4\">The district court provided no explanation for imposing a thirty-month sentence other than to ensure that Meza would have an opportunity to participate in a drug treatment program during his period of incarceration. Because we are unable to find any evidence in the sentencing record that shows that Meza\u2019s sentence \u2014 determined solely by reference to the prohibited consideration of Meza\u2019s rehabilitative needs \u2014 \u201cis \u2018fair,\u2019 or that the \u2018integrity or public reputation\u2019 of the judicial proceeding was protected\u201d despite the erroneous consideration of Meza\u2019s need for a drug treatment program, we conclude that the error seriously affected the \u201cfairness, integrity or public reputation\u201d of sentencing proceedings. <em>See Escalante-Reyes, </em>689 F.3d at 425-26; <em>cf. United States v. Davis, </em>602 F.3d 643, 648, 652 (5th Cir.2010) (declining to exercise discretion to remand for resentencing when the defendant received a sentence above both the incorrect and corrected advisory range where the record demonstrated that the district court, in imposing the sentence, \u201cplaced great weight on the seriousness of the circumstances\u201d surrounding the defendant\u2019s violations of supervised release).</p>\n<p id=\"b488-5\">Therefore, we conclude that we should exercise our discretion to correct this error. <em>See Garza, </em>706 F.3d at 663 (explaining that reversal was warranted in light of this court\u2019s precedent in <em>Escalante-Reyes</em>); <em>Escalante-Reyes, </em>689 F.3d at 426 (remanding for resentencing and explaining that it was particularly appropriate to exercise the discretion to correct an error \u201c[gjiven Congress\u2019s express admonition that \u2018imprisonment is not an appropriate means of promoting correction and rehabilitation,\u2019 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(a), and the Supreme Court\u2019s recent analysis in <em>Tapia </em>\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b488-6\">Accordingly, Meza\u2019s sentence is VACATED and the case is REMANDED for resentencing in accordance with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b486-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b487-6\">. In <em>Tapia, </em>although the Supreme Court reversed the judgment of the Ninth Circuit, the Court explained that \u201c[consistent with our practice ... we leave it to the Court of Appeals to consider the effect of [the defendant's] failure to object to the sentence when imposed.\u201d 131 S.Ct. at 2393 (citations omitted).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
