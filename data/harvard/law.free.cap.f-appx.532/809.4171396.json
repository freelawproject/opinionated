R.App. P. 34(a)(2); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G).

In his original petition, Petitioner argued that the Bureau of Prisons had improperly denied him good-time credits \u201cin direct violation of Policy.\u201d (R. at 3.) Petitioner additionally asserted that various prison officials refused to provide him with the necessary habeas corpus forms and continued to withhold his inmate account statement and legal envelopes.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> After reviewing Petitioner\u2019s petition, the magistrate judge issued an order directing Petitioner to cure various deficiencies in his pleading within thirty days. Specifically, the magistrate judge identified the following deficiencies: (1) Petitioner failed to submit a motion to proceed <em>in forma pauperis </em>pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915, (2) Petitioner failed to submit a certified statement showing the current balance in his prison account, (3) Petitioner\u2019s petition was not submitted on the proper court forms, and (4) Petitioner\u2019s \u201cclaims challenge the execution of his sentence and [should be] raised in an action filed pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241\u201d as opposed to the general \u201cHabeas Corpus\u201d document Petitioner originally filed. (R. at 8.) The magistrate judge further instructed Petitioner that if he was unable to comply with the order because of the prison officials\u2019 alleged refusal to provide the necessary documents and information, Petitioner \u201cmust provide evidence that he submitted a request to prison staff for each of the three items and prison staff responded telling him that they would not provide any of the three items.\u201d <em>(Id.) </em>The magistrate judge concluded by warning Petitioner that \u201cfail[ure] to cure the designated deficiencies within thirty days from the date of this Order\u201d would result in dismissal \u201cwithout further notice.\u201d (R. at 9 (bolding omitted).) Rather than comply with the magistrate judge\u2019s order, Petitioner filed an identical pleading to his original petition. He made no effort to comply with the magistrate judge\u2019s order to substantiate his repeated allegation that prison officials refused to provide the necessary documents and information. As a result of Petitioner\u2019s failure to comply with the order, the district court dismissed Petitioner\u2019s petition without prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-6\">Petitioner now appeals, arguing the district court erred in dismissing his petition. He argues only generally that the court\u2019s order \u201cignored the law\u201d (Petitioner\u2019s Opening Br. at 4) \u2014 particularly that \u201c \u2018Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 8(a)(2) requires only a short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief,\u2019 \u201d <em>(id. </em>at 3 (quoting <em>Erickson v. Pardus, 551 U.S. 89, 127 </em>S.Ct. 2197, 2200, 167 L.Ed.2d 1081 (2007))) \u2014 \u201cignored the facts,\u201d and \u201cignored the grounds for relief\u2019 <em>(id. </em>at 4). Petitioner, however, makes no attempt to excuse his failure to comply with the magistrate judge\u2019s order or his failure to explain to the magistrate judge, if true, why it was impossible to cure the designated deficiencies. After reviewing the record on appeal, and particularly in light of the sparsity of Petitioner\u2019s briefing, we see no error in the district court\u2019s dismissal of Petitioner\u2019s petition. Accordingly, the district court\u2019s order is AFFIRMED. Petitioner\u2019s motion to proceed <em>in forma pauperis </em>on appeal is GRANTED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b835-8\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. It may be cited, however, for its persuasive value consistent with Fed. R.App. P. 32.1 and 10th Cir. R. 32.1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b836-4\">.
