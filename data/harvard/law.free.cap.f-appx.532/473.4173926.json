He argues that the district court plainly erred in imposing a 16-level crime of violence enhancement pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii) based on his Texas conviction for burglary of a habitation with intent to commit theft. He contends that because his conviction falls under Texas\u2019s unique \u201cgreater right to possession\u201d theory, it does not constitute a generic burglary conviction under <em>Taylor v. United States, </em>495 U.S. 575, 110 S.Ct. 2143, 109 L.Ed.2d 607 (1990), and, therefore, it was not a conviction for burglary of a dwelling under \u00a7 2L1.2. Because Avila Avellaneda did not raise this objection in the district court, review is limited to plain error. <em>See United States v. Chavez-Hernandez, </em>671 F.3d 494, 497-99 (5th Cir.2012); <em>see also Puckett v. United States, </em>556 U.S. 129, 135, 129 S.Ct. 1423, 173 L.Ed.2d 266 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b500-4\">We recently rejected this argument in <em>United States v. Morales-Mota, </em>704 F.3d 410 (5th Cir.2013). Accordingly, pursuant to <em>Morales-Mota, </em>the district court\u2019s application of the 16-level enhancement in this case was proper. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b500-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b499-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
