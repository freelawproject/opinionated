The district court found that the complaint was subject to dismissal because, <em>inter alia, </em>the defendants were immune from suit, that Buchanan\u2019s claims were barred pursuant to <em>Heck v. Humphrey, </em>512 U.S. 477, 114 S.Ct. 2364, 129 L.Ed.2d 383 (1994), because his conviction had not been overturned or invalidated, or, alternatively, that the claims were time barred under Texas\u2019s two-year statute of limitations. The district court thus dismissed the complaint as frivolous, malicious, and for failure to state a claim. Buchanan filed a timely notice of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-19\">In his appellate brief, Buchanan argues the merits of his claims challenging the validity of his indictment and conviction. He does not, however, address the district court\u2019s immunity analysis or its alternative determinations that his claims were barred by <em>Heck </em>or that they were untimely. Accordingly, he has abandoned any challenge to those determinations, <em>see Brinkmann v. Dallas County Deputy Sheriff Abner, </em>813 F.2d 744, 748 (5th Cir.1987), and has failed to demonstrate that his \u201cappeal involves legal points arguable on their merits.\u201d <em>Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 220 (5th Cir.1983) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Because Buchanan has not shown that his appeal involves an issue of arguable merit, we dismiss his appeal as frivolous. <em>See </em>5TH CIR. R. 42.2. Buchanan\u2019s motion for the appointment of counsel, his motion for the production of documents, and any other outstanding motions are denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-20\">The district court\u2019s dismissal of Buchanan\u2019s complaint as frivolous and this court\u2019s dismissal of his appeal as frivolous count as two strikes for purposes of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 387-88 (5th Cir.1996). Buchanan has at least one other strike resulting from the dismissal of a frivolous complaint. <em>See Buchanan v. Cooley, </em>No. 5:03-CV-76 (N.D.Tex. Apr. 10, 2003). As Buchanan has accumulated at least three strikes under \u00a7 1915(g), he may not proceed IFP in any civil action or appeal filed in a court of the United States while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility un<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>less he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1915(g). Buchanan is further warned that any future frivolous or repetitive filings in this court or in any court subject to this court\u2019s jurisdiction will subject him to additional sanctions.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-7\">APPEAL DISMISSED; ALL OUTSTANDING MOTIONS DENIED; \u00a7 1915(g) BAR IMPOSED; WARNING ISSUED, SANCTION</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b620-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
