For the reasons that follow, we will deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-23\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-24\">After illegally entering the United States, Lemus Retana was served with a Notice to Appear charging him with being removable as an alien present in the United States without being admitted or paroled. (A.R.361.) He conceded removability but sought cancellation of removal. He asserted that he was physically present in the United States for a continuous period of ten years and that his qualifying relatives (his United States citizen wife and daughter) would suffer exceptional and extremely unusual hardship if he were removed. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b(b)(l).</p>\n<p id=\"b228-25\">The Immigration Judge (\u201cIJ\u201d) found that Lemus Retana failed to show the requisite hardship because his wife and daughter were healthy, would remain in the United States if he were removed, and would be financially secure because his wife was employed. (A.R.83.) Lemus Retana\u2019s cancellation of removal application was, therefore, denied. He appealed to the BIA, arguing that he had established continuous presence and that his qualifying relatives would suffer exceptional and extremely unusual hardship upon his removal.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> (A.R.44-51.)</p>\n<p id=\"b229-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>The BIA dismissed his appeal, affirming the IJ\u2019s dispositive finding that Lemus Retana failed to establish exceptional and extremely unusual hardship. (A.R.17.) Le-mus Retana then filed a motion for reconsideration solely pertaining to that issue. (A.R.9-14.) The BIA denied reconsideration (A.R.3) and Lemus Retana timely petitioned for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-6\">The Government argues that Lemus Retana waived any challenge to the BIA\u2019s denial of his motion for reconsideration because he does not mention it at all in his brief. (Resp\u2019t Br., p. 7.) It is true that Lemus Retana\u2019s arguments pertain only to the BIA\u2019s opinion dismissing his appeal and the IJ\u2019s credibility determinations. (Pet\u2019r\u2019s Br., pp. 2, 14.) We only have jurisdiction to review the BIA\u2019s denial of his motion for reconsideration, because that is the only decision from which he filed a timely petition for review.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a) and (b)(1); <em>Stone v. INS, </em>514 U.S. 386, 405, 115 S.Ct. 1537, 131 L.Ed.2d 465 (1995); <em>McAllister v. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>444 F.3d 178, 185 (3d Cir.2006). Le-mus Retana\u2019s arguments are irrelevant to the issue that is properly before us, that is, whether the BIA abused its discretion in denying his motion for reconsideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-7\">The BIA denied Lemus Retana\u2019s motion for reconsideration because he did not present new legal arguments or point out specific errors of fact or law in its decision dismissing his appeal. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. 1003.2(b)(1). Indeed, the record reflects that Lemus Retana\u2019s motion for reconsideration merely repeated arguments that he previously made on appeal. (A.R. 9-14; 48-51.) Thus, we conclude that the BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying Lemus Retana\u2019s motion for reconsideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-10\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-11\">For the foregoing reasons, we will deny Lemus Retana\u2019s petition for review.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b228-17\">. Because there were several discrepancies in the dates Lemus Retana provided regarding his entry into the United States, the IJ also found that he \"failed to establish that he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>continuously resided in the U.S. during the requisite period.\u201d (A.R.103.) Lemus Retana raised the issue of continuous physical presence on appeal to the BIA, but the BIA did not consider it, given that his failure to establish the requisite hardship was dispositive. (A.R.17.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b229-22\">. We apply the abuse of discretion standard to our review, and will disturb the BIA\u2019s denial of a motion to reconsider only if it was \"arbitrary, irrational, or contrary to law.\u201d <em>Borges v. Gonzales, </em>402 F.3d 398, 404 (3d Cir.2005).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
