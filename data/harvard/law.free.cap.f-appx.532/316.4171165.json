Because we conclude that the decision is entitled to deference under <em>Chevron U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., </em>467 U.S. 837, 842-44, 104 S.Ct. 2778, 81 L.Ed.2d 694 (1984), we will do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-19\">I.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b343-20\">In October 2004, the Elder family brought an action in Missouri state court asserting causes of action for wrongful death and strict liability against Amtrol after a gas tank manufactured by Amtrol exploded, killing Kenneth Elder. On December 18, 2006, Amtrol filed for bankruptcy in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware. The Elder family submitted proofs of claim to the Bankruptcy Court on March 22, 2007, and Amtrol objected to those claims on June 25, 2007, arguing that the claims were preempted by the Hazardous Materials Transportation Act (\u201cHMTA\u201d), 49 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 5101, <em>et seq.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b343-21\">Section 5125(d) of the HMTA provides that \u201c[a] person ... directly affected by a requirement of a State, political subdivision, or tribe may apply to the Secretary [of the Department of Transportation (\u201cDOT\u201d) ] ... for a decision on whether the requirement is preempted by subsection (a), (b)(1), or (c) of this section.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 5125(d)(1). Amtrol attempted to exercise this option by writing to the DOT for a preemption determination on June 26, 2007. The DOT declined to make a preemption determination at that time, believing it to be premature.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-22\">The litigation before the Bankruptcy Court proceeded, and on April 1, 2008, the Court issued an order denying Amtrol\u2019s objections, concluding that they were not preempted. On April 11, 2008, Amtrol appealed the Bankruptcy Court\u2019s order to the District Court, and also renewed its application to the DOT for a determination of the preemption issue. This time, the DOT agreed to consider the matter and published notice in the Federal Register <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>on January 30, 2009. Amtrol, the Elder family, and a few other interested parties submitted comments in response to the DOT notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-4\">While the application was still pending before the DOT, the District Court entered an order on June 28, 2010, affirming the Bankruptcy Court\u2019s ruling. Amtrol appealed that order to our Court on July 27, 2010.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-5\">We granted Amtrol\u2019s unopposed motion to stay the appeal while the DOT determination was forthcoming, and issued a series of stays between October 2010 and July 2012. The DOT issued its preemption ruling on July 3, 2012, concluding that the HMTA did preempt the Elder family\u2019s claims. Amtrol now argues that the DOT\u2019S determination is entitled to <em>Chevron </em>deference and asks us to reverse and remand to the District Court with instructions to reverse the Bankruptcy Court\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-7\">As a general rule, an agency\u2019s construction of an ambiguous statute under its purview, and in which it has special expertise, is entitled to deference. <em>Nat\u2019l Cable &amp; Telecomms. Ass\u2019n v. Brand X Internet Servs., </em>545 U.S. 967, 982, 125 S.Ct. 2688, 162 L.Ed.2d <em>820 (2005) (\u201cChevron\u2019s </em>premise is that it is for agencies, not courts, to fill statutory gaps.\u201d). The HMTA delegates to the DOT the authority to interpret the preemption provisions of Section 5125. 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 5125(d)(1). Where Congress has spoken clearly on the precise issue, no deference is owed to the agency\u2019s interpretation of a statute. <em>See Chevron, </em>467 U.S. at 843 &amp; n. 9, 104 S.Ct. 2778. Further, where an agency\u2019s interpretation reflects an impermissible construction of the statute, we will not defer to the agency\u2019s view. <em>See id. </em>at 843, 104 S.Ct. 2778.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-10\">Having carefully reviewed the submissions of Amtrol (the only party to this appeal) and the record, including the memoranda of the District Court and the Bankruptcy Court, we conclude that Section 5125 is ambiguous. Because the DOT\u2019S preemption determination is a reasonable construction of that statue, it is entitled to <em>Chevron </em>deference. <em>See Nat\u2019l Cable &amp; Telecomms. Ass\u2019n, </em>545 U.S. at 982, 125 S.Ct. 2688.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-11\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-12\">Accordingly, we will vacate the judgment of the District Court with the instruction that it reverse the April 1, 2008 and the April 21, 2008 orders of the Bankruptcy Court on the issue of federal preemption.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b343-23\">. The District Court had jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 158(a). We have jurisdiction under \u00a7 158(d)(1) and 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
