(collectively, \u201cKeller\u201d) appeal the denial by the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania of their post-trial motions for judgment as a matter of law and a new trial under Rules 50 and 59 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. The jury had returned a split verdict partially favoring Keller and partially favoring Plaintiffs-Appellees L.P.P.R, Inc. and Le-high Press Pharmaceutical Products, Inc. (collectively, \u201cLehigh\u201d). For the reasons that follow, we will reverse the District Court\u2019s denial of Keller\u2019s motion for judgment as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-16\">I. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b295-17\">At its discretion, Puerto Rico offers a tax credit to the purchaser of a distressed Puerto Rican business if the purchaser guarantees that it will continue operations in Puerto Rico for at least ten years. If the purchased company shuts down before that time, the purchaser must return a share of the credit proportional to the number of years under ten that it did not operate. The government will issue the credit only to a purchaser that guarantees its promise to remain in business by posting collateral, typically, but not necessarily, in the form of a bond. P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 13, \u00a7 10646(d). The purchaser may either use the tax credit itself, or it may sell it.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-18\">Through two Asset Purchase Agreements (the \u201cContract\u201d <footnotemark>1</footnotemark>), Keller agreed to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>purchase Lehigh\u2019s distressed Puerto Rico-based printing businesses. The Contract provided that Keller would sell the potential tax credits and that the parties would share the \u201cnet proceeds\u201d from that sale\u2014 described in the Contract as the \u201cnet of costs incurred by Purchaser [Keller] in connection with collecting and selling such tax credits.\u201d (App. at 1844, 2043.) The parties never discussed what specifically would constitute a cost incurred in the \u201ccollecting and selling\u201d of the tax credits. Under the Contract, ninety percent of the net proceeds of the sale of the tax credits were to be allocated to Lehigh and ten percent to Keller.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-4\">To secure the tax credits, Keller posted a series of bonds whose premiums total $317,917. Puerto Rico granted the credits in the amount of $2.1 million, which Keller then sold for $1,858,500 to a third-party purchaser. From that amount, Keller paid the tax credit broker it had hired a fee of $73,500. Before transferring to Lehigh its share of the remaining proceeds, Keller provided a spreadsheet listing additional amounts Keller planned to deduct for the \u201ccosts of securing and selling the tax credits.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at 2443, 2445.) Those costs included the $317,917 cost of the bonds<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and $207,542 in legal fees. Keller then deducted the cost of the bonds and legal fees and transferred ninety percent of the remaining $1,133,587 to Lehigh.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-8\">Believing that those costs did not qualify as costs of \u201ccollecting and selling\u201d the tax credits, Lehigh brought this diversity action against Keller in the District Court.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Lehigh asserted that Keller breached the parties\u2019 contract by deducting both the costs of the tax credit bonds and the Puerto Rico tax lawyer\u2019s professional fees, before distributing the proceeds of the sale of the credits.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-9\">Following discovery, Keller moved for summary judgment, contending that, under the plain meaning of the Contract, it committed no breach because the word \u201ccollecting\u201d in the Contract \u201cunambiguously refers to securing or obtaining the tax credit from the Puerto Rican tax authorities.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at 666.) Keller therefore insisted that both the costs of the tax bonds and the attorneys\u2019 fees were among the costs of \u201ccollecting and selling\u201d the tax credits. In opposition, Lehigh offered a competing interpretation of the Contract under which the word \u201ccollecting\u201d would refer only to the \u201ccosts incurred in collecting the proceeds of selling the tax credits,\u201d such as \u201cbank transfer fees and the cost of pursuing payment if the buyer refused to pay in a timely fashion.\u201d <em>(Id.) </em>In support of that interpretation, Lehigh maintained that \u201cone cannot \u2018collect\u2019 a tax credit,\u201d but may only claim it. <em>(Id.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b296-10\">The District Court acknowledged that \u201cthe parties differ greatly in their interpretation of what the words of the contract <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>mean\u201d <em>(id. </em>at 671), but it nonetheless declined to decide which interpretation was correct or even to determine whether the contractual language is susceptible of more than one meaning and therefore is ambiguous. The Court explained that \u201c[t]he briefs and appendices in this case are over four inches thick,\u201d and that it could \u201cprepare and preside over a jury trial, and reach a verdict in the same or less time than it would take to carefully review the filings and do the appropriate research.\u201d <em>(Id.) </em>The Court specified that it was \u201cnot necessarily finding that these terms are ambiguous or are not ambiguous,\u201d but was rather denying the motion for \u201cprudential reasons.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at 670-71.)</p>\n<p id=\"b297-5\">The District Court\u2019s decision to sidestep the interpretation question left the parties in an awkward position. Before trial, Keller filed a motion in limine asking the Court to hold that the terms of the Contract are unambiguous and to accordingly bar any testimony contradicting the terms of the written contract under the parol evidence rule. The Court granted the motion, stating that at trial it would not allow any parol evidence to \u201ccontradict[ ] the terms of the written contract.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at 1105.) Of that ruling, the Court stated that it did \u201cnot rul[e] that the[ ] terms [of the Contract] were ambiguous,\u201d because \u201c[t]he words ... collecting and selling ... are normal English words. There\u2019s nothing ... ambiguous about them.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at 1109-10.) Despite the parties\u2019 continued dispute over how the words \u201ccollecting and selling\u201d should be understood in the Contract, the Court did not explain at that time, or any time throughout this litigation, what those terms mean.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-6\">At trial, however, the Court did allow Lehigh\u2019s witnesses to testify, over Keller\u2019s repeated and strenuous objections, about their personal understanding of the Contract, which happened to coincide with Le-high\u2019s pre-trial interpretation. For example, Pedro Notario, Lehigh\u2019s accountant and lawyer, was asked his \u201cunderstanding\u201d of the meaning of \u201cnet of costs incurred by purchaser in connection with collecting and selling such tax credits.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at 8011.) Keller\u2019s counsel objected to that question on the basis of the parol evidence rule, but the Court overruled the objection. Notario responded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b297-8\">Okay. Well, there is no reference in the law or the regulations to collecting a tax credit. When you see the word collecting on this agreement, you can only \u2014 in the general usage, I understand that you can only collect something to which you are entitled to and you have a right. Since you cannot collect something that you do not have a right, collecting needs to happen after you have generated and own the tax credit.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b297-9\">Since there is no way to collect money from the government of Puerto Rico, in order to collect money with regards to a tax credit, you need to sell the credit to a third party and then collect the money from the third party, if he doesn\u2019t pay as agreed to in the sale agreement with the buyer of the credit.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b297-10\"><em>(Id. </em>at 3012-13.) Keller objected again, asking the Court to strike Notario\u2019s testimony. The Court refused, but instead instructed the jury that Notario\u2019s testimony constituted \u201chis understanding of the terms, and [that it] may not consider that to be any contradiction of the words in the agreement because we\u2019re all bound by that selling \u2014 the cost of selling and collecting. ... [T]hose are English words....\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at 3013.) At another point in his testimony, Notario testified, once again over Keller\u2019s objection, that the word \u201ccollect\u201d either was mere surplusage or the phrase \u201ccollecting and selling\u201d really meant \u201cselling the credit\u201d and thereafter \u201ccollecting the monies from the buyer of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>the credits.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at 3008-09 (\u201cYou need to sell the credit, and any monies that you\u2019re going to collect, you need to collect from the buyer of the credits.\u201d).)</p>\n<p id=\"b298-4\">Peter Schaefer, a consultant to Lehigh during Contract negotiations, was also asked, over Keller\u2019s objection, his \u201cunderstanding of the words ... \u2018net of costs incurred by purchaser in connection with collecting and selling such tax credits\u2019 \u201d at the time he \u201cw[as] negotiating this asset purchase agreement.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at 2763.) He said that \u201cbrokerage fees, bank fees, maybe wiring charges, things of that nature,\u201d could be considered \u201cthe selling cost.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at 2764.) As for the cost of collecting, he claimed that he \u201chadn\u2019t envisioned collection costs because you aren\u2019t collecting the credits.\u201d <em>(Id.) </em>What he had \u201cenvisioned that to mean,\u201d rather, \u201cwould be in the unlikely event that the credits had been sold and the buyer of the credits did not live up to the agreement that they had made.\u201d <em>(Id.) </em>In other words, \u201cif they were to make subsequent payments and they did not make those payments, that would be the cost of going to collect the payments from that buyer.\u201d <em>(Id.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b298-5\">And John DePaul, former chairman of Lehigh\u2019s board, testified regarding precontract discussions about the expected selling price of the tax credits. He said that the bonds could not have been a cost \u201cincurred in collecting and selling the tax credit,\u201d but rather were simply \u201ca cost of buying the company,\u201d to be shouldered by Keller alone. <em>(Id. </em>at 24.) He explained that, as chairman of the board, he would have refused to \u201cpost the collateral or share in the posting of the collateral,\u201d because that would be akin to requiring Le-high \u201cto post collateral of a million dollars that [Keller] will keep the plant open for the next ten years.\u201d <em>(Id.) </em>According to DePaul, that would constitute an unwise business decision because Lehigh would have no \u201ccontrol\u201d over whether Keller \u201ckept the plant open for ten years or not.\u201d <em>(Id.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b298-7\">At the conclusion of the evidence, Keller filed a Rule 50 motion for judgment as a matter of law, which the Court denied, allowing the breach of contract claim to go to the jury. Specifically, the jury was asked, via separate verdict sheets, to decide whether Keller had breached the Contract by deducting the cost of the tax credit bonds and the cost of the Puerto Rico tax lawyer\u2019s fees. The Court explained that \u201cthe words in the contract are clear. \u2018Cost,\u2019 \u2018selling,\u2019 and \u2018collecting\u2019 are not ambiguous terms\u201d <em>(id. </em>at 10), and it instructed the jury that, because the Contract was unambiguous, \u201cits plain meaning alone dictates the outcome\u201d <em>(id.; see also id. </em>at 14 (instructing the jury that \u201ccost, collecting, and selling\u201d are \u201cUS English words, and each must be given their plain and ordinary meaning\u201d)). The jury was therefore to \u201cascribe to the words of [the] contract their common or ordinary meaning, and interpret them as would an objectively, reasonable third-party observer.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at 14.) In a final jury instruction, the Court told the jury that it must not use trial testimony to contradict the written terms of the Contract: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number><em>(Id.) </em>The jury ultimately returned a split verdict, finding that the attorneys\u2019 fees were costs of \u201ccollecting and selling\u201d the tax credits (and thus were appropriately deducted), but that the bonds were not.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b298-8\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>[Cjontract law does not allow the parties to offer any evidence for the purpose of contradicting or changing the terms of an unambiguous agreement. The testimony you have heard in the case may not be used or considered by you to alter, change, or modify the terms of the agreement in determining whether Keller breached the agreement. However, you may use the testimony that you found credible to determine the background, the context, the intent of the parties, and their understanding of the terms of the agreement.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b299-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>Keller then filed another Rule 50 motion, and a Rule 59 motion for a new trial, insisting that the testimony described above constituted inadmissible parol evidence that tainted the outcome of the trial. The Court denied both motions. Saying that the testimony \u201cenabled the jury to better understand the complex subject matter of this case and to complete effectively its job of finder of fact, including, whether, as a matter of fact, Keller breached the Contract,\u201d <em>(id. </em>at 11) the Court declared that \u201cthe evidence in question was not admitted to alter the terms of the written agreement or to create a new term not present on the face of the Contract\u201d <em>(id. </em>at 15). Instead, the Court said that, \u201cin view of the fact that Puerto Rican tax credits ... are outside the scope of the jury\u2019s knowledge,\u201d the testimony provided relevant \u201cbackground to aid the jury in fulfilling its role as fact finder.\u201d <em>(Id.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b299-6\">Ultimately, the Court concluded that the \u201cjury competently carried out its job as fact-finder to determine whether Keller breached the contract by subtracting its attorneys\u2019 fees and bond premium,\u201d and it denied Keller\u2019s Rule 50 and Rule 59 motions. <em>(Id. </em>at 25-26.) This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-7\">II. Discussion<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b299-8\">We engage in plenary review of a district court\u2019s denial of a motion for judgment as a matter of law under Rule 50 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. <em>Trabal v. Wells Fargo Armored Serv. Corp., </em>269 F.3d 243, 249 (3d Cir.2001). A motion for a \u201cRule 50 directed verdict ... may be granted only if, as a matter of law, viewing all the evidence which has been tendered and should have been admitted in the light most favorable to the party opposing the motion, no jury could decide in that party\u2019s favor.\u201d <em>Tigg Corp. v. Dow Coming Corp., </em>822 F.2d 358, 361 (3d Cir. 1987). Given that Keller\u2019s position hinges on a question of contract interpretation, to rule for Keller \u201cwe must conclude that the contract is so clear it can only be read one way,\u201d <em>Pennbarr Corp. v. Ins. Co. of N. Am., </em>976 F.2d 145, 149 (3d Cir.1992)\u2014 namely, to mean that the costs of \u201ccollecting and selling\u201d the tax credits unambiguously includes the costs associated with posting collateral, which are necessary to obtaining the credits. The \u201cquestion of whether contract terms are clear or ambiguous is one of law.\u201d <em>Id. We </em>conclude that the terms are unambiguous and that the District Court erred in denying Keller\u2019s Rule 50 motions for judgment as a matter of law.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b299-12\">The court and jury occupy distinct roles in contract interpretation. \u201cIt is the function of the court to make the preliminary determination, out of hearing of the fact-finder, as to whether an ambiguity <em>may </em>exist.\u201d <em>Tigg, </em>822 F.2d at 362-63. \u201cWhether a contract is ambiguous is a question of law.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 362. In making that initial determination, courts applying Delaware law are \u201cguided by the \u2018elementary canon of contract construction that the intent of the parties must be ascertained from the language of the contract.\u2019 \u201d <em>In re IAC/InterActive Corp., </em>948 A.2d 471, 494 (Del.Ch.2008) (quoting <em>Citadel Hold</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number><em>ing Corp. v. Roven, </em>603 A.2d 818, 822 (Del.1992)). \u201c[CJontract terms are not ambiguous merely because the parties to the contract disagree; rather, the court stands in the shoes of an objectively reasonable third-party observer, and ascertains whether the contract language is unmistakably clear.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(alterations and internal quotation marks omitted). \u201cThe true test is not what the parties to the contract intended it to mean, but what a reasonable person in the position of the parties would have thought it meant.\u201d <em>Rhone-Poulenc Basic Chems. Co. v. Am. Motorists Ins. Co., </em>616 A.2d 1192, 1196 (Del.1992); <em>see also U.S. West, Inc. v. Time Warner, Inc., </em>Civ. A. No. 14555, 1996 WL 307445, at *9 (Del.Ch., June 6, 1996) (\u201cThe primary rule of construction is this: where the parties have created an unambiguous integrated written statement of their contract, the language of that contract (not as subjectively understood by either party but) as understood by a hypothetical reasonable third party will control.\u201d). \u201cAbsent some ambiguity, Delaware courts will not' destroy or twist ... [contract] language under the guise of construing it.\u201d <em>Rhone-Poulenc, </em>616 A.2d at 1195.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-4\">In addition, \u201cDelaware courts have consistently held that an interpretation that gives effect to each term of an agreement is preferable to any interpretation that would result in a conclusion that some terms are uselessly repetitive,\u201d and \u201cMon-tracts are to be interpreted in a way that does not render any provisions illusory or meaningless.\u201d <em>O\u2019Brien v. Progressive N. Ins. Co., </em>785 A.2d 281, 287 (Del.2001) (internal quotation marks omitted); <em>see also In re IAC/InterActive Corp., </em>948 A.2d at 497 (\u201cDelaware courts do prefer to interpret contracts to give effect to each term rather than to construe them in a way that renders some terms repetitive or mere surplusage.\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)). If the court determines that the contract is unambiguous, \u201cthe writing itself is the sole source for gaining an understanding of intent.\u201d <em>City Investing Co. Liquidating Trust v. Cont\u2019l Cas. Co., </em>624 A.2d 1191, 1198 (Del.1993); <em>see also Cohen v. Formula Plus, Inc., </em>750 F.Supp.2d 495, 503 (D.Del.2010) (\u201cUpon concluding that the contract clearly and unambiguously reflects the parties\u2019 intent, the court\u2019s interpretation of the contract must be confined to the four corners of the document.\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b300-6\">The factfinder plays a role in contract interpretation under Delaware law only when the court, without looking to any \u201cevidence from outside the contract\u2019s four corners,\u201d determines that the words of the contract are ambiguous, meaning that \u201creasonable minds could differ as to the contract\u2019s meaning.\u201d <em>GMG Capital Invs., LLC v. Athenian Venture Partners I, L.P., </em>36 A.3d 776, 783 (Del.2012). Only then does \u201ca factual dispute result[ ]\u201d regarding the intended meaning of the ambiguous terms, and the factfinder may then \u201cconsider admissible extrinsic evidence\u201d to resolve that dispute. <em>Id.; see also Eagle Indus., Inc. v. DeVilbiss Health Care, Inc., </em>702 A.2d 1228, 1232 (Del.1997) (holding that a contract provision was ambiguous, reversing summary judgment, and remanding for a consideration of extrinsic evidence by the Court of Chancery as fact-finder).</p>\n<p id=\"b300-7\">Thus, although the jury has a role in determining, through a factual inquiry, the parties\u2019 intentions regarding an ambiguous contract provision, there is no role for the jury to play in contract interpretation when there is no ambiguity. That is a matter of settled law. <em>See Pennbarr, </em>976 F.2d 145 (reversing district court and overturning jury verdict where contract was unambiguous and therefore summary judgment should have been entered); <em>Riv</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number><em>erbend Cmty., LLC v. Green Stone Eng\u2019g, LLC, </em>55 A.3d 330, 334 &amp; n. 11 (Del.2012) (court has \u201clong upheld awards of summary judgment in contract disputes where the language at issue is clear and unambiguous\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)); <em>United Rentals, Inc. v. RAM Holdings, Inc., </em>937 A.2d 810, 830 (Dd.Ch.2007) (\u201c[T]he threshold inquiry when presented with a contract dispute on a motion for summary judgment is whether the contract is ambiguous. Ambiguity does not exist simply because the parties disagree about what the contract means. Moreover, extrinsic, parol evidence cannot be used to manufacture an ambiguity in a contract that facially has only one reasonable meaning.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b301-5\">Yet the District Court, although it repeatedly said that the disputed terms are not ambiguous, never stated what they unambiguously mean. In other words, it never chose which of the parties\u2019 divergent interpretations was correct \u2014 Keller\u2019s interpretation that \u201ccollecting ... tax credits\u201d included the costs associated with obtaining the credits, or Lehigh\u2019s interpretation that \u201ccollecting ... tax credits\u201d referred only to the costs of collecting payment from the third-party purchaser of the tax credits, something that would occur only after the purchaser underwent the expense of posting a bond to obtain the credits.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b301-6\">The result of the District Court\u2019s decision not to opine on the meaning of the disputed words was a series of objections and related problems at trial, as the jury\u2019s factfinding role morphed into a duty to rule on the meaning of disputed terms that the Court had already decided were not fairly susceptible of more than one interpretation. The Court instructed the jury to \u201cinterpret [the Contract] as would an objectively, reasonable third-party observer\u201d (App. at 14), but that is a role that should have been played by the Court itself, not the jury. <em>See In re IAC/InterActive Corp., </em>948 A.2d at 494 (explaining that it is \u201cthe <em>court </em>[that] stands in the shoes of an objectively reasonable third-party observer\u201d to interpret a contract (emphasis added) (alterations and internal quotation marks omitted)). Adding to the difficulties, the Court repeatedly allowed the jury to receive evidence of the Contract\u2019s meaning from outside the four corners of the Contract, something that should not occur with regard to unambiguous contract provisions. <em>See City Investing, </em>624 A.2d at 1198 (\u201cIf a writing is plain and clear on its face, <em>i.e., </em>its language conveys an unmistakable meaning, the writing itself is the sole source for gaining an understanding of intent.\u201d). The jury therefore was not, as the District Court said, \u201ccompetently carr[ying] out its job as fact-finder,\u201d but rather, at the Court\u2019s insistence, was filling the judicial role of contract interpreter, and it did so subject to the improper testimony of Lehigh\u2019s witnesses regarding their personal understanding of the Contract terms.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-9\">We agree with the District Court that the disputed words of the Contract are unambiguous. They can reasonably bear Keller\u2019s interpretation of them but not Le-high\u2019s, and no other interpretation has been suggested. In other words, the Contract is not \u201creasonably susceptible\u201d of any suggested meaning but the one Keller as<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>cribes to it, and it therefore cannot be said to be ambiguous. <em>Twin City Fire Ins. Co. v. Del. Racing Ass\u2019n, </em>840 A.2d 624, 628 (Del.2003) (\u201cContract language is ambiguous if it is reasonably susceptible of two or more interpretations or may have two or more different meanings.\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b302-4\">A hypothetical reasonable third party would, we believe, understand the costs associated with \u201ccollecting and selling\u201d the tax credits to include the costs of securing those credits in the first place. To collect is \u201cto receive, gather, or exact from a ... source[ ],\u201d Webster\u2019s Third New Int\u2019l Dictionary 444 (1971), \u201cto claim as due and receive payment for,\u201d Merriam-Webster\u2019s Collegiate Dictionary 243 (11th ed.2005). In that sense, it would certainly be reasonable for a third party to understand the Contract to mean that the costs associated with claiming and securing the tax cred<em>its </em>\u2014 e.g., the necessary costs of posting collateral to obtain the credits in the first place \u2014 constitute costs of collecting them.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-5\">Lehigh points out that the Puerto Rican statute that provides for the granting of tax credits to purchasers of distressed businesses speaks, as the District Court said in denying Keller\u2019s motion for judgment as a matter of law, in terms of \u201cclaiming\u201d the credits. <em>(See </em>App. at 24 (\u201cThe word \u2018collect\u2019 is not included in the law or regulations relating to the tax credit. The statute instead describes the process as \u2018claiming the credits.\u2019 \u201d).) But that semantic variance does not render Keller\u2019s interpretation unreasonable. At the least, it is reasonable to conclude that to <em>claim </em>a tax credit is functionally the same as to <em>collect </em>one. Collecting a tax credit is the corollary of paying taxes. In the case of tax payment, an entity pays taxes and the government <em>collects </em>them. With tax credits, the situation is reversed; the government issues the credits, which are <em>claimed </em>or <em>collected </em>by the taxpayer. The tax credit, once collected by the taxpayer, can then either be applied against profit or sold to some other entity that can apply them against profit. That is not an unreasonable understanding of the term <em>collecting, </em>which, after all, must be given some effect, lest it be rendered \u201cillusory or meaningless.\u201d <em>O\u2019Brien, </em>785 A.2d at 287 (internal quotation marks omitted).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b302-8\">In contrast, Lehigh\u2019s view is unreasonable because it would run afoul of ordinary rules of contract construction. The Contract plainly provides for the deduction of two things from the proceeds of the sale of the tax credits: (1) costs incurred in <em>collecting </em>the tax credits, and (2) costs incurred in <em>selling </em>the tax credits. <em>(See </em>App. at 1844, 2043 (providing for deduction of the costs of \u201ccollecting and selling such tax credits\u201d).) Yet Lehigh advocates a reading of the Contract that would expel <em>collecting </em>from its natural place at the head of the phrase antecedent to <em>tax credits, </em>and force upon it the unnatural role of modifying and applying, after the fact, to the costs of collecting the <em>proceeds of the sale </em>of the tax credits to a third party. That appears to be nothing but wishful thinking that \u201ctwist[s]\u201d the language of the Contract \u201cunder the guise of construing it.\u201d <em>Rhone-Poulenc, </em>616 A.2d at 1195. No hypothetical reasonable third party would read that meaning into the Contract without the benefit of extrinsic evidence of intent, and even then the interpretation is tortured. Because Lehigh\u2019s interpretation of the Contract would do substantial violence to the text of the Contract, and as such would likely not ring true to the ears <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>of an objective reasonable third party, the Contract is not reasonably susceptible of Lehigh\u2019s interpretation. We are left with one reasonable interpretation, Keller\u2019s, and judgment for Keller is thus warranted as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-5\">IV. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b303-6\">For the foregoing reasons, we will reverse the District Court\u2019s denial of Keller\u2019s Rule 50 motion for judgment as a matter of law and remand with directions that judgment be entered for Keller on the Contract claim.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b295-19\">. The two agreements, one with Lehigh Press and one with L.P.P.R., are largely the same, and the specific provisions at issue in this appeal are identical. For ease of reference, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>we thus refer to the \"Contract\u201d in the singular.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b296-6\">. Keller paid the premiums for the first three years of bond coverage. Although it had only made three, rather than ten, years of premium payments, Keller deducted all ten years of projected premium payments from the proceeds of the sale of the tax credits, discounted to their net present value.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b296-7\">. Although the Contract provided that it was to be \"governed and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware,\u201d it also specified that \"all actions or proceedings arising in connection\u201d with the Contract \"shall be tried and litigated exclusively in the Federal court located in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania.\u201d (App. at 1857.) Lehigh originally pleaded numerous causes of action in the District Court, but the only claim at issue in this appeal, and the only one that went to the jury, is Lehigh\u2019s single count for breach of contract (Count I in Lehigh\u2019s amended complaint). That is the only claim we discuss.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b299-9\">. The District Court had diversity jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b299-13\">. Given our view that Keller merits judgment as a matter of law, <em>see infra, </em>we need not address the District Court's denial of Keller\u2019s Rule 59 motion for a new trial.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b301-7\">. The District Court acknowledged that the posting of collateral was a prerequisite of acquiring the tax credit, stating that Lehigh \"did not dispute ... that before Keller could complete the process of collecting and selling, Keller had to acquire a bond.\" (App. at 23 (intemal quotation marks omitted).) In a similar vein, Lehigh admitted in its brief that \"a bond is and was the most common form of security posted to secure tax credits.\u201d (Appellees' Br. at 7.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b302-6\">. That Keller in its correspondence with Le-high spoke of \"securing\u201d the credits does not undermine this analysis.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
