Smith insists on appeal that his motion for reconsideration, in which he challenges his guilty plea, should have been construed as an amendment to his 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2255 (West Supp.2013) motion, and we treat the court\u2019s denial of the motion for reconsideration as also denying \u00a7 2255 relief to Smith.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-20\">An order denying relief under \u00a7 2255 is not appealable unless a circuit justice or judge issues a certificate of appealability. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(1)(B) (2006). A certificate of appealability will not issue absent \u201ca substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2). When the district court denies relief on the merits, a prisoner satisfies this standard by demonstrating that reasonable jurists would find that the district court\u2019s assessment of the constitutional claims is debatable or wrong. <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000); <em>see Miller-El v. Cockrell, </em>537 U.S. 322, 336-38, 123 S.Ct. 1029, 154 L.Ed.2d 931 (2003). When the district court denies relief on procedural grounds, the prisoner must demonstrate both that the dispositive procedural ruling is debatable, and that the motion states a debatable claim of the denial of a constitutional right. <em>Slack, </em>529 U.S. at 484-85, 120 S.Ct. 1595. We have independently reviewed the record and conclude that Smith has not made the requisite showing. Accordingly, we deny a certificate of appealability and dismiss the appeal in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-21\">With respect to the district court\u2019s order denying Smith\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion, we have reviewed the record and find no reversible error. Accordingly, we affirm for the reasons stated by the district court. <em>United States v. Smith, </em>No. 4:04-cr-00093-RGD-TEM-l (E.D.Va. July 11, 2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b437-22\">We also conclude that the district court lacked the authority to revisit its earlier order denying \u00a7 3582(c)(2) relief to Smith. <em>United States v. Goodwyn, </em>596 F.3d 233, 235-36 (4th Cir.2010). Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s denial of Smith\u2019s motion for reconsideration on that basis. We dispense with oral argument because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before this court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-4\">\n<em>DISMISSED IN PART; AFFIRMED IN PART.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
