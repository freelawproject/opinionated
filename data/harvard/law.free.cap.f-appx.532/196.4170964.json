Hussain also appeals a District Court order enjoining him from filing future motions and actions against the Appellee, Barry Frost. For the reasons that follow, we will dismiss Hussain\u2019s appeal related to the Bankruptcy Court\u2019s order and affirm the District Court\u2019s order imposing sanctions.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-20\">In 1999, Hussain filed a bankruptcy petition pursuant to Chapter 13 of the United States Bankruptcy Code. His case was converted to Chapter 7 and Frost was appointed as Interim Trustee. On May 13, 2011, the Bankruptcy Court issued a final decree stating that the case had been fully administered. The Bankruptcy Court discharged Frost and closed the case. On March 1, 2012, Hussain filed a motion to compel Frost to account for and turn over <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>rents collected by Frost\u2019s property manager. The Bankruptcy Court denied the motion in an order entered April 9, 2012.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-5\">Hussain appealed the Bankruptcy Court\u2019s order to District Court. Frost moved to dismiss the appeal on the grounds that it was untimely filed and frivolous. Frost also moved for sanctions against Hussain under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11 based on Hussain\u2019s alleged abuse of the judicial process. The District Court dismissed Hussain\u2019s appeal and granted the motion for sanctions to the extent Frost sought to enjoin Hussain from filing further motions against him in the bankruptcy case and further actions against him in state and federal court. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-6\">We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 158(d)(1). The District Court did not state in its order the basis of its decision to dismiss Hussain\u2019s appeal of the Bankruptcy Court\u2019s order. Because Frost has challenged the timeliness of that appeal, we exercise <em>de novo </em>review over the question of the District Court\u2019s jurisdiction. <em>In re Caterbone, </em>640 F.3d 108, 111 (3d Cir.2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b223-7\">Hussain was required to file his notice of appeal with the clerk within 14 days of the Bankruptcy Court\u2019s April 9, 2012 order denying his motion to compel. Fed. R. Bankr.P. 8002(a). Hussain dated his notice of appeal April 13, 2012, but it is date-stamped received and was filed in Bankruptcy Court on May 3, 2012. The date a court receives a notice of appeal controls whether it was timely filed. <em>See United States v. Solly, </em>545 F.2d 874, 876 (3d Cir. 1976) (construing Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure); <em>see also Caterbone, </em>640 F.3d at 110 (looking at date notice of appeal in bankruptcy case was filed, not sent, in assessing timeliness). Because Hussain\u2019s notice of appeal was received after the 14-day time period expired on April 23, 2012, it was untimely.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Hussain also did not file a motion to extend the time for filing a notice of appeal pursuant Rule 8002(c). The District Court thus lacked jurisdiction to entertain Hussain\u2019s appeal. <em>See Caterbone, </em>640 F.3d at 111-12 (holding time for filing notice of appeal under Rule 8002 is jurisdictional). As a result, we also lack jurisdiction over Hussain\u2019s appeal of the District Court\u2019s dismissal order. <em>Id. </em>at 113.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b223-11\">Although the District Court lacked jurisdiction over Hussain\u2019s appeal, it had the power to order sanctions under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11 that are collateral to the merits of the appeal. <em>Tellado v. IndyMac Mortg. Serv., </em>707 F.3d 275, 281 (3d Cir.2013). Frost\u2019s motion for sanctions was based on Hussain\u2019s alleged abuse of the judicial system. Frost sought sanctions under Rule 11 based upon Hussain\u2019s repeated motions, filed after the bankruptcy case was closed, that attempted to relitigate decided issues or that lacked merit. In its order granting the request for sanctions, the District Court considered Frost\u2019s motion, which described some of the filing history, and found that Hussain had engaged in vexatious legal tactics in bad faith as demonstrated by the frivolousness of his multiple motions and appeals. To address this conduct, the District Court en<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>tered an injunction barring Hussain from filing any further legal action or making motions in matters in which he and Frost were litigants but it imposed no monetary sanction. The sanction of enjoining future filings by Hussain did not have the effect of adjudicating the merits of the appeal and the sanctions order was thus within the District Court\u2019s authority. <em>See id.</em><footnotemark><em>3</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b224-4\">We generally review a ruling on a motion for Rule 11 sanctions for abuse of discretion. <em>Gary v. The Braddock Cemetery, </em>517 F.3d 195, 201 (3d Cir.2008). Hussain, however, has not developed in his brief any legal argument as to why the District Court\u2019s order constituted an abuse of discretion. He states only that the sanctions \u201care not justified, as can be seen from the 341 meeting matter.... \u201d Appellant\u2019s Br. at 6. Hussain contends in his brief that Frost misrepresented in his bankruptcy proceedings that Hussain attended this meeting, but the meeting has nothing to do with Frost\u2019s motion for sanctions. Hussain has not shown that the District Court abused its discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-5\">Accordingly, we will dismiss this appeal to the extent Hussain appeals the District Court\u2019s dismissal of his appeal of the Bankruptcy Court\u2019s order and we will affirm the District Court\u2019s order imposing sanctions. To the extent Hussain requests other relief from this Court, <em>see </em>Appellant\u2019s Br. at 7-8, such requests are not properly before us.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b223-8\">. Hussain appears to have attempted to email a notice of appeal to the Bankruptcy Judge's chambers on April 13, 2013. Chambers replied the same day that the court required an original signature and that Hussain must mail or bring his notice of appeal to the court before the 14-day deadline expired. Hussain's e-mail did not satisfy Federal Rule of Bankruptcy Procedure 8002, which requires that a \"notice of appeal shall be filed with the clerk....\u201d Fed. R. Bankr.P. 8002(a).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b223-13\">. We thus will not address Frost's alternative argument that the appeal is frivolous.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b224-7\">. Frost did assert in his motion for sanctions that Hussain\u2019s appeal was frivolous, but the motion and attorney certification focus on Hussain\u2019s alleged abuse of the judicial process.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
