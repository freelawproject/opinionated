TYMKOVICH, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b855-6\">David Bloomgren, a federal prisoner proceeding pro se, appeals the district court\u2019s denial of his motion to modify his sentence pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c). Exercising jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, we AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-7\">I. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b855-8\">Bloomgren was convicted of federal narcotics and firearms charges and was sentenced to 360 months\u2019 imprisonment. The sentencing court enhanced his offense level under United States Sentencing Guideline (USSG) \u00a7 4Bl.l(a) after finding Bloomgren was a career offender, based on several prior violent and drug-related felony convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-9\">Bloomgren unsuccessfully appealed his conviction and sentence. <em>See United States v. Bloomgren, </em>42 Fed.Appx. 147 (10th Cir.2002). He then filed a motion to vacate his sentence under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255, but was again unsuccessful. <em>See United States v. Bloomgren, </em>160 Fed.Appx. 764 (10th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b855-14\">On May 10, 2011, six years after his \u00a7 2255 petition was denied, Bloomgren filed a motion to amend his sentence pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c), arguing his sentence was improperly calculated under Sentencing Guideline Amendment 591. The district court denied his motion one week later. Bloomgren then waited almost an entire year before filing his notice of appeal on March 5, 2012. As justification for this late filing, Bloomgren claimed he was not notified of the district court\u2019s decision until he contacted the court on February 27, 2012.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b855-15\">II. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b855-16\">We review the denial of a reduction in sentence under \u00a7 3582(c) for an abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Dorrough, </em>84 F.3d 1309, 1311 (10th Cir.1996). But we review the district court\u2019s interpretation of the USSG and other legal issues de novo. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"830\">*830</page-number><em>United States v. Smartt, </em>129 F.3d 539, 540 (10th Cir.1997). We construe Bloomgren\u2019s filings liberally as he is proceeding pro se. <em>Andrews v. Heaton, </em>483 F.3d 1070, 1076 (10th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b856-4\">Federal courts may not modify a term of imprisonment once it has been imposed except in very limited circumstances. <em>Dillon v. United States, </em>560 U.S. 817, 130 S.Ct. 2683, 2687, 177 L.Ed.2d 271 (2010). There are three main exceptions: (1) when the Bureau of Prisons moves for a reduction based on a finding that special circumstances warrant it, (2) when expressly permitted by statute or Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 35, or (3) when a defendant was sentenced based on a sentencing range that is subsequently lowered. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c). Even in such cases, courts may not lower the defendant\u2019s sentence except to the extent doing so is consistent with the factors listed in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) and the Sentence Commission\u2019s policy statement, found at USSG \u00a7 1B1.10. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). If none of the exceptions in \u00a7 3582(c) applies, the district court lacks jurisdiction to consider a defendant\u2019s request for a sentence reduction. <em>Smartt, </em>129 F.3d at 541.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-5\">Bloomgren bases his argument on Amendment 591 to the USSG, effective November 1, 2000. <em>See </em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual, App. C, Amend. 591. This amendment revised two sections: USSG \u00a7 1B1.2, to clarify that a sentencing court must apply the offense guideline referenced in the Statutory Index for the statute of conviction, without regard to uncharged relevant conduct; and USSG \u00a7 2D1.2, which clarified that the enhanced penalties of that section \u2014 for delivering drugs in certain locations, such as near a school, or to certain vulnerable individuals \u2014 apply only when a defendant is convicted of an offense specifically referenced in that section.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-7\">As the district court explained, this amendment does not apply to Bloomgren for two reasons. First, Bloomgren\u2019s sentence was not enhanced under USSG \u00a7 2D1.2. Bloomgren argues the offenses he was convicted of are not listed in this section, which is true, but this is irrelevant. His sentence was enhanced under USSG \u00a7 2D1.1(b)(1), not \u00a7 2D1.2, and Amendment 591 did not affect this provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-8\">Second, the sentencing court properly applied a career criminal enhancement to Bloomgren under \u00a7 4Bl.l(a). Bloomgren argues Amendment 591 is applicable because \u00a7 1B1.2 directs the court to determine the offense guideline section based on the offense of conviction and does not mention the career criminal enhancements in \u00a7 4B1.1. But according to \u00a7 lBl.l(a), determining the offense guideline section under \u00a7 IB 1.2 is only the first step in calculating a defendant\u2019s guideline range. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lBl.l(a)(l). The sixth step, \u00a7 1B1.1(a)(6), directs the sentencing court to apply the career offender provisions, including \u00a7 4B1.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-9\">Amendment 591 had no affect on the career offender guidelines in \u00a7 4B1.1. <em>See United States v. McCalister, </em>314 Fed.Appx. 110,112 (10th Cir.2008). Thus it did not lower Bloomgren\u2019s sentencing range. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). Because none of the other \u00a7 3582(c) exceptions apply, we have no authority to consider Bloomgren\u2019s request for a sentence reduction. <em>Smartt, </em>129 F.3d at 541.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-10\">III. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b856-11\">For the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM the district court\u2019s denial of Bloomgren\u2019s motion to modify his sentence. Bloom<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"831\">*831</page-number>gren\u2019s motion to proceed in forma pauperis on appeal is also DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b855-11\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata and collateral estoppel. It may be cited, however, for its persuasive value consistent with Fed. R.App. P. 32.1 and 10th Cir. R. 32.1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b855-12\">. We note that this potentially renders Bloomgren's appeal untimely. In criminal cases, the notice of appeal must be filed within 14 days after the entry of judgment. Fed. R.App. P. 4(b)(1). This rule also applies to appeals from denials of \u00a7 3582(c) motions. <em>See United States v. Espinosa-Talamantes, </em>319 F.3d 1245, 1246 (10th Cir.2003). A district court may grant an extension of time to file the notice of appeal, but may not grant more than 30 additional days. Fed. R.App. P. 4(b)(4); <em>Espinosa-Talamantes, </em>319 F.3d at 1246-47. Even if the district court had granted Bloomgren 30 additional days to file his notice of appeal, he would have had only until June 30, 2011 to file it.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-18\">But this is not a jurisdictional requirement, but rather a claim-processing rule that, \"unlike a jurisdictional rule, may be forfeited if not properly raised by the government.\" <em>United States v. Gardu\u00f1o, </em>506 F.3d 1287, 1290-91 (10th Cir.2007). The government, in its answer brief, notes Bloomgren\u2019s untimely filing, but states that it will not raise this issue as it prefers to address his arguments on the merits. And though we may raise the issue of Bloomgren\u2019s untimely filing <em>sua sponte, </em>we should refrain from doing so \u201cwhen judicial resources and administration are not implicated and the delay has not been inordinate.\u201d <em>United States v. Mitchell, </em>518 F.3d 740, 750 (10th Cir.2008). We find neither of these factors is implicated, and thus will address the merits of Bloomgren\u2019s appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
