As a result of Scholz\u2019s conviction for misdemeanor possession of methamphetamine in violation of California Health and Safety Code \u00a7 11377(a), the Department of Homeland Security issued a Notice to Appear and charged Scholz with being removable under Section 237(a)(2)(B)(i) of the Immigration Naturalization Act. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(B)(i). She argues that the evidence introduced by the government \u2014 a criminal complaint and court docket sheet \u2014 was inadmissible and insufficient to establish removability. We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D), and we deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-5\">In <em>United States v. Snellenberger, </em>this court held that a California court clerk\u2019s minute order was as equally reliable as the documents listed in <em>Shepard v. United States, </em>544 U.S. 13, 125 S.Ct. 1254, 161 L.Ed.2d 205 (2005), and thus could be used to prove the \u201cnature\u201d of a conviction in applying the modified categorical approach. 548 F.3d 699, 701-02 (9th Cir. 2008) (en banc), <em>abrogated on other grounds by Young v. Holder, </em>697 F.3d 976 (9th Cir.2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b776-6\">This case involved a court docket sheet, and California Penal Code \u00a7 1428 states that a clerk may keep a docket sheet in lieu of a minute order \u201c[i]n misdemeanor and infraction cases\u201d and that \u201can entry ... in the docket ... shall be deemed a sufficient entry in the minutes or register of action for all purposes.\u201d CaLPenal Code \u00a7 1428. Because docket sheets may be kept instead of minute orders for misdemeanor cases pursuant to California state law, they qualify as a document of equal reliability under <em>Snellenberger </em>and can be used to prove the \u201cnature\u201d of a conviction in applying the modified categorical approach.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-9\">Though the docket sheet notes only that Scholz pleaded nolo contendere to Count One of the complaint without listing additional facts, Count One of the complaint specifies that Scholz was charged with possession of methamphetamine. <em>Cabantac v. Holder </em>held that if an abstract of judgment or minute order \u201cspecifies that a defendant pleaded guilty to a particular count of the criminal complaint or indictment, we can consider the facts alleged in that count.\u201d 693 F.3d 825, 827 (9th Cir. 2012). This court can consider the facts alleged in the complaint because, as in <em>Cabantac, </em>the docket sheet states that Scholz pleaded guilty to Count One in the complaint, which specifies possession of methamphetamine.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-10\">Thus, the BIA properly considered the docket as admissible evidence, which established by clear and convincing evidence that Scholz pleaded guilty to possession of methamphetamine.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-11\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b776-13\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
