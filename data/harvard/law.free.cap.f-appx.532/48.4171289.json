Because this appeal does not present a substantial ques<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>tion, we will summarily affirm. <em>See </em>3d Cir. L.A.R 27.4; I.O.P. 10.6.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-5\">Because we primarily write for the parties, we need only recite the facts necessary for our discussion. Allah\u2019s claims concern conditions of his confinement. Specifically, for a three-month period, from August 31, 2006 to November 21, 2006, Allah was housed in cell 32, on the seven wing housing unit. Allah claimed that the cell had extensive water damage. During Allah\u2019s placement in cell 32, he stated that it rained approximately twelve times, and that after each time it rained, the cell leaked. The problems with the cell were on the days it rained, and two or three days after it rained, not consistently for three months. Allah stated that he suffered headaches and from sleep deprivation from having to sleep on wet and cold sheets. He also stated that he was afraid he would get shocked because of the way the light fixture was installed in his cell, but that he was never actually shocked. Moreover, Allah alleged that the Appellees knew about the water problem in his cell, but failed to act. Allah claimed that these conditions violated the Eighth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-6\">The parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment. The District Court granted the Appellees\u2019 motion to dismiss, or in the alternative, for summary judgment and denied Allah\u2019s motion for summary judgment, because, among other reasons, Allah did not meet the standard for an Eighth Amendment conditions of confinement claim. Allah subsequently filed a timely motion for reconsideration of the District Court\u2019s judgment, which the District Court denied. Allah timely filed this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-8\">We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. Because Allah\u2019s timely appeal from the denial of his motion for reconsideration \u201cbrings up the underlying judgment for review,\u201d <em>McAlister v. Sentry Ins. Co., </em>958 F.2d 550, 552-53 (3d Cir. 1992), we will review the District Court\u2019s grant of summary judgment to Appellees and denial of summary judgment to Allah, as well as its denial of Allah\u2019s motion for reconsideration, even though the notice of appeal expressly Seeks to appeal only the denial of the motion for reconsideration. <em>LeBoon v. Lancaster Jewish Cmty. Ctr. Ass\u2019n, </em>503 F.3d 217, 225 n. 6 (3d Cir.2007). We exercise plenary review of a district court\u2019s order granting or denying summary judgment, applying the same standard as the district court. <em>See Tri-M Grp., LLC v. Sharp, </em>638 F.3d 406, 415 (3d Cir.2011). We will affirm only <em>if </em>\u201cdrawing all reasonable inferences in favor of the nonmoving party, there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and ... the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The same standards and burdens apply on cross-motions for summary judgment. <em>Appelmans v. City of Phila., </em>826 F.2d 214, 216 (3d Cir.1987). We review the denial of a motion for reconsideration for abuse of discretion. <em>Lazaridis v. Wehmer, </em>591 F.3d 666, 669 (3d Cir.2010). We may summarily affirm the District Court\u2019s decision if the appeal presents no substantial question. <em>See </em>L.A.R. 27.4; I.O.P. 10.6.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-9\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-10\">The Eighth Amendment protects prison inmates from cruel and unusual punishment. <em>See, e.g., Farmer v. Brennan, </em>511 U.S. 825, 832, 114 S.Ct. 1970, 128 L.Ed.2d 811 (1994). However, not all deficiencies and inadequacies in prison conditions amount to a violation of a prisoner\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>constitutional rights. <em>Rhodes v. Chapman, </em>452 U.S. 887, 349, 101 S.Ct. 2392, 69 L.Ed.2d 59 (1981). To assert an Eighth Amendment conditions of confinement claim, a prisoner must satisfy both an objective and subjective test. <em>See Wilson v. Seiter, </em>501 U.S. 294, 298, 111 S.Ct. 2321, 115 L.Ed.2d 271 (1991). Specifically, a prisoner must show that the alleged deprivation is \u201csufficiently serious\u201d and that he has been deprived of the \u201cminimal civilized measure of life\u2019s necessities.\u201d <em>Farmer, </em>511 U.S. at 834, 114 S.Ct. 1970 (1994). A prisoner must also demonstrate that \u201che is incarcerated under conditions posing a substantial risk of serious harm\u201d and that prison officials possessed a \u201csufficiently culpable state of mind\u201d and demonstrated \u201cdeliberate indifference\u201d to his health or safety. <em>Id. </em>However, only \u201cextreme deprivations\u201d are sufficient to present a claim for unconstitutional conditions of confinement. <em>Hudson v. McMillian, </em>503 U.S. 1, 8-9, 112 S.Ct. 995, 117 L.Ed.2d 156 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b77-5\">We agree with the District Court that Allah has not met the objective prong of the test, as the conditions to which Allah was exposed do not rise to the level of extreme deprivation. The record shows that the problem with the rain was not consistent for the three months Allah was housed in cell 32, but that it was only a problem for the day it rained and two or three days thereafter. According to Allah, it rained approximately twelve times during the three months that he was housed in cell 32. While Allah alleges he suffered headaches as a result of the water leaking in his cell and suffered some discomfort, the record shows that Allah did not suffer any substantial injury to his person or property. The record shows that the prison complied with constitutional standards at the most basic level, and Allah does not provide any evidence from which a reasonable jury could conclude that he was deprived of the \u201cminimal civilized measure of life\u2019s necessities,\u201d <em>Farmer, </em>511 U.S. at 834, 114 S.Ct. 1970 (1994), or that his health and safety were at risk. <em>See Hassine v. Jeffes, </em>846 F.2d 169, 174-75 (3d Cir.1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b77-7\">Because the objective prong of the Eighth Amendment inquiry cannot be satisfied on the undisputed facts presented here, there is no need to address the subjective prong. Accordingly, we conclude that the District Court properly granted the Appellees\u2019 motion for summary judgment and properly denied Allah\u2019s motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-8\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-9\">Generally, motions for reconsideration under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 59(e) must rely on one of the following three grounds: \u201c(1) an intervening change in controlling law; (2) the availability of new evidence; or (3) the need to correct clear error of law or prevent manifest injustice.\u201d <em>Lazaridis v. Wehmer, </em>591 F.3d 666, 669 (3d Cir.2010) (per curiam) (citation omitted). We agree with the District Court that Allah\u2019s motion for reconsideration does not meet the requirements necessary to permit the District Court to reconsider its decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-10\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-11\">For the foregoing reasons, no substantial question is presented and we will affirm the judgment of the District Court. <em>See </em>3d Cir. L.A.R 27.4; I.O.P. 10.6. Appellant\u2019s motion to stay the proceedings is denied.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b77-13\">. Because we find that Allah has failed to assert a valid Eighth Amendment conditions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>of confinement claim, there is no need to address whether Allah exhausted his administrative remedies as required by the Prison Litigation Reform Act, or whether Allah's claims are barred by the Eleventh Amendment.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
