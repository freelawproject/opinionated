ROTH, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b647-9\">In this sentencing appeal, John R\u00fagala challenges the district court\u2019s application of a two-level enhancement to his base offense level for obstruction of justice under \u00a7 3C1.1 of the United States Sentencing Guidelines. For the reasons that follow, we affirm the sentence imposed by the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-10\">I. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b647-11\">John R\u00fagala was convicted of one count of bank fraud, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1344, on November 21, 2011. R\u00fagala had been a car dealer in the Cleveland, Ohio, area, where he owned John R\u00fagala Chevrolet and was a co-owner of R\u00fagala Stanton Motors. By late 2000, John Rugala Chevrolet was experiencing financial problems. In response to this, R\u00fagala and others began engaging in a check-kiting scheme whereby they wrote checks back and forth between the two car dealerships. This allowed them to create short-term loans for the dealerships by taking advantage of their banks\u2019 practice of allowing customers to draw upon checks once they were deposited, even though it took several days for the checks to clear. This scheme ultimately caused a loss of approximately $1.2 million to the banks involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-15\">Most pertinent to this appeal, R\u00fagala learned on January 25, 2001, that John R\u00fagala Chevrolet faced a cash shortfall, but on that same day he signed 51 checks totaling over $1 million from John R\u00fagala Chevrolet\u2019s account to R\u00fagala Stanton Motors. He signed another 49 checks for over $1 million to R\u00fagala Stanton Motors the next day.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-16\">R\u00fagala testified in his own defense. At the end of his direct examination, with respect to the checks written in January 2001, R\u00fagala said \u201cI thought they were backed by actual money.\u201d On cross-examination, however, R\u00fagala testified that he knew John R\u00fagala Chevrolet was short on cash on January 25, 2001, when he began writing checks to R\u00fagala Stanton Motors. He also testified that John R\u00fagala Chevrolet\u2019s office manager told him the dealership was short on cash because they were waiting to receive approximately $500,000 worth of financing for used vehicles, $100,000 from outstanding contracts, and monies that would be coming in from regular business. On re-direct, R\u00fagala further testified that the office manager indicated to him that money would be coming in from \u201c[financing] of cars, contracts that were going to be cashed from the sale of vehicles, and parts, maybe an open account statement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b648-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"622\">*622</page-number>At sentencing, the government sought a two-level enhancement to Rugala\u2019s base offense level for obstruction of justice under \u00a7 3C1.1 of the Sentencing Guidelines. The government pointed to the statements, described above, that R\u00fagala made on direct examination and cross-examination to argue that R\u00fagala committed perjury-while testifying. After argument on this issue, the district court made the following ruling:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b648-4\">Based upon the testimony specifically now cited by the government as to Mr. Rugala\u2019s testimony indicating that he only signed \u2014 well, he signed checks and he believed that there was always money in the account to cover, that he never signed a check when he didn\u2019t believe there was money in the account to cover, juxtaposed with the cited testimony on cross-examination, the Court does find that there was perjurious testimony and will apply the two-level enhancement for obstruction.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b648-5\">The district court sentenced R\u00fagala to 37 months imprisonment on March 14, 2012. R\u00fagala appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-6\">II. Analysis<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b648-7\">R\u00fagala argues that the district court erred by imposing the two-level enhancement for obstruction of justice under \u00a7 3C1.1 of the Sentencing Guidelines. We review the district court\u2019s findings of fact with respect to the obstruction of justice enhancement for clear error, but we review its determination of whether the facts constitute obstruction, and its application of the enhancement, de novo. <em>United States v. Watkins, </em>691 F.3d 841, 851 (6th Cir.2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b648-8\">Section 3C1.1 of the Sentencing Guidelines mandates a two-level increase to a defendant\u2019s offense level when he \u201cwillfully obstructed or impeded ... the administration of justice with respect to the investigation, prosecution, or sentencing of the ... offense of conviction.\u201d U.S. Sentencing Guidelines \u00a7 3C1.1. Application Note 4 contains a non-exhaustive list of conduct to which the enhancement applies, including \u201ccommitting, suborning, or attempting to suborn perjury.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at cmt. n. 4; <em>see United States v. Dunnigan, </em>507 U.S. 87, 98, 113 S.Ct. 1111, 122 L.Ed.2d 445 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b648-11\">In order to properly apply a \u00a7 3C1.1 enhancement for obstruction of justice, \u201cthe court must 1) identify those particular portions of defendant\u2019s testimony that it considers to be perjurious; and 2) either make a specific finding for each element of perjury or, at least, make a finding that encompasses all of the factual predicates for a finding of perjury.\u201d <em>United States v. Boring, </em>557 F.3d 707, 712 (6th Cir.2009) (internal quotation marks omitted); <em>see United States v. Kennedy, </em>714 F.3d 951, 961-62 (6th Cir.2013). The elements of perjury are \u201cfalse testimony concerning a material matter with the willful intent to provide false testimony, rather than as a result of confusion, mistake, or faulty memory.\u201d <em>Kennedy, </em>714 F.3d at 962 (quoting <em>Boring, </em>557 F.3d at 712).</p>\n<p id=\"b648-12\">R\u00fagala argues that the district court\u2019s finding that R\u00fagala lied by testifying that he thought the checks he wrote were \u201cbacked by actual money\u201d was clearly erroneous. \u201cA finding is clearly erroneous when the reviewing court on the entire evidence is left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.\u201d <em>United States v. Gilpatrick, </em>548 F.3d 479, 484-85 (6th Cir.2008) (quoting <em>Heights Cmty. Cong. v. Hilltop Realty, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"623\">*623</page-number><em>Inc., </em>774 F.2d 135, 140 (6th Cir.1985)). Based on our review of the testimony at trial, we cannot conclude that the district court\u2019s finding that R\u00fagala testified falsely was clearly erroneous. R\u00fagala admitted that he knew John R\u00fagala Chevrolet\u2019s account faced a cash shortfall when he wrote over $2 million worth of checks drawing from that account. This clearly contradicts Rugala\u2019s statement that he believed these checks were backed by actual money.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-5\">R\u00fagala argues that the phrase \u201cbacked by actual money\u201d was used at trial to also mean that an expected inflow of money would cover a check such that there would be money in the account at the time the check was presented. Under this meaning, R\u00fagala argues, he did not lie because he did expect an inflow of money into John R\u00fagala Chevrolet\u2019s account before the checks to R\u00fagala Stanton Motors were cashed. Even attributing this meaning to the phrase \u201cbacked by actual money,\u201d we cannot conclude that the district court clearly erred in finding that R\u00fagala testified falsely. R\u00fagala testified on cross-examination that he believed $500,000 worth of financing, $100,00 worth of outstanding contracts, and regular business would be coming into John R\u00fagala Chevrolet\u2019s account. This, too, contradicts Rugala\u2019s statement the he believed the checks were \u201cbacked by actual money\u201d because he signed checks for over $2 million and knew John R\u00fagala Chevrolet\u2019s account was already short on cash. Therefore, the district court\u2019s finding that R\u00fagala testified falsely was not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-6\">Because the district court\u2019s factual findings were not clearly erroneous, the district court did not err by applying the obstruction of justice enhancement in \u00a7 3C1.1 to determine Rugala\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-7\">III. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b649-8\">For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the district court\u2019s judgment of sentence.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b648-9\">. The district court had jurisdiction pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3231, and this court has jurisdiction pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(a).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
