On appeal, the Petitioners argue that the BIA abused its discretion in denying their second motion to reopen because the evidence established that circumstances in Venezuela have become increasingly more dangerous for people like themselves who publicly criticized then \u2014 President Chavez and his government. The Petitioners also argue that there are new circumstances that support their asylum claim that have yet to be presented to the BIA.</p>\n<p id=\"b872-13\">We review the denial of a motion to reopen for an abuse of discretion. <em>See Jiang v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>568 F.3d 1252, 1256 (11th Cir.2009). Our review is limited to determining whether the BIA exercised its discretion in an arbitrary or capricious manner. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b872-14\">A party may only file one motion to reopen removal proceedings, and that motion \u201cshall state the new facts that will be proven at a hearing to be held if the motion is granted, and shall be supported by affidavits or other evidentiary material.\u201d INA \u00a7 240(c)(7)(A)-(B), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(7)(A)-(B). A \u201cmotion to reopen shall be filed within 90 days of the date of entry of a final administrative order of removal,\u201d subject to certain exceptions. INA \u00a7 240(c)(7)(C)(i), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(7)(C)(i). Regulations governing BIA practice provide that an exception to the time and number limits applies if the motion to reopen is for the purpose of reapplying for relief \u201cbased on changed circumstances arising in the country of nationality or in the country to which deportation has been ordered, if such evidence is material and was not available and could not have been discovered or presented at the previous hearing.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(e)(3)(ii). A change in personal circumstances, however, does not authorize the untimely filing of a motion to reopen. <em>See Jiang, </em>568 F.3d at 1258 (noting that, while changed personal circumstances do not meet the standard for a petition to reopen, the petitioner had established changed country conditions because China had recently increased enforcement of the one-child policy in the area where she was from).</p>\n<p id=\"b872-16\">We have held that, at a minimum, the BIA may deny a motion to reopen on the following three grounds: (1) failure to es<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"847\">*847</page-number>tablish a prima facie case; (2) failure to introduce evidence that was material and previously unavailable; or (3) a determination that an alien is not entitled to a favorable exercise of discretion despite statutory eligibility for relief. <em>See Al Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1302 (11th Cir. 2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b873-5\">Even in the context of a ruling on the merits, the BIA or the Immigration Judge is not required to discuss in its opinion or order every piece of evidence presented. <em>Tan v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>446 F.3d 1369, 1374 (11th Cir.2006). \u201cWhere the BIA has given reasoned consideration to the petition, and made adequate findings, we will not require that it address specifically each claim the petitioner made or each piece of evidence the petitioner presented.\u201d <em>Seek v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>663 F.3d 1356, 1364 (11th Cir.2011) (quotation omitted). The BIA must \u201cconsider the issues raised and announce its decision in terms sufficient to enable a reviewing court to perceive that it has heard and thought and not merely reacted.\u201d <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b873-6\">Upon review of the record and consideration of the parties\u2019 briefs, we deny the petition. The BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying the Petitioners\u2019 second motion to reopen, as that motion was time- and number-barred, and the Petitioners failed to establish changed country conditions in Venezuela. As the BIA found, the evidence submitted in support of the Petitioners\u2019 motion did not sufficiently demonstrate changed country conditions in Venezuela with regard to those politically opposed to the current government.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-7\">The 2006 Country Report submitted with the Petitioners\u2019 original asylum application indicated that: (1) the security forces committed unlawful killings and forcibly repressed some peaceful demonstrations; (2) the judiciary was increasingly less independent; and (3) the government held a small number of political prisoners, imposed <em>de facto </em>limitations on freedoms of speech and the press, criminalized insults made against President Chavez, and was perceived as being corrupt. The 2010 Country Report submitted with the motion to reopen made similar, and in some instances almost identical, statements, and thus, does not show that country conditions in Venezuela have materially changed with regard to the treatment of those politically opposed to the current government. Likewise, the sworn statements submitted with the motion to reopen do not establish an abuse of discretion because, at most, they show that the Petitioners face the same fear of persecution because of their political activities that they did at the time of their 2008 removal hearing. Furthermore, the Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch reports and the articles submitted with the motion to reopen do not establish that conditions in Venezuela have changed. These reports and articles discuss current conditions in Venezuela, give no indication as to how things are different than before, and contain no allegations materially different from the Country Reports.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-9\">The BIA also did not abuse its discretion by not providing a detailed explanation about how all of the evidence did not support the Petitioners\u2019 changed-country-conditions claim. Because the BIA adequately explained why it denied the motion to reopen, it was not required to provide such a detailed explanation about how all of the evidence in the record did not support the Petitioners\u2019 claim of changed country conditions. <em>See Seek, </em>663 F.3d at 1364. Contrary to the Petitioners\u2019 argument, the BIA did consider whether the Petitioners\u2019 evidence showed changed country conditions, and concluded that it did not.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"848\">*848</page-number>As for the Petitioners\u2019 argument that there is new evidence to support the asylum claim, we cannot address this new evidence because our review is limited to the administrative record. <em>See </em>INA \u00a7 242(b)(4)(A), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(A). To the extent that the Petitioners\u2019 new evidence argument is a request for us to remand the case to the BIA for consideration of this evidence, we do not have the authority to grant such a request. <em>See </em>INA \u00a7 242(a)(1), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(1) (stating that a reviewing court \u201cmay not order the taking of additional evidence\u201d under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2347(c)). <em>See also Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1278-79, 1281 (explaining that the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 eliminated this Court\u2019s authority to remand a case to the BIA for consideration of new evidence).</p>\n<p id=\"b874-4\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
