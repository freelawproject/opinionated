Astrue, </em>572 F.3d 586, 590 (9th Cir.2008) (emphasis removed), and \u201cwill uphold the Commissioner\u2019s denial of benefits if the Commissioner applied the correct legal standards and substantial evidence supports the decision,\u201d <em>Stout v. Comm\u2019r, Soc. Sec. Admin., </em>454 F.3d 1050, 1052 (9th Cir. 2006). After conducting de novo review of the extensive record in this case, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-21\">Brown argues that the ALJ improperly concluded that she had a medium residual functional capacity (\u201cRFC\u201d). We find that the ALJ\u2019s conclusion that Brown had a medium RFC is supported by substantial evidence in the record. The ALJ properly rejected the testimony of \u201csome older (pre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"689\">*689</page-number>current application) assessments\u201d in favor of \u201cmore recent\u201d opinions. The ALJ also properly credited more recent medical evidence which was consistent with the record as a whole. <em>See Carmickle v. Comm\u2019r, Soc. Sec. Admin., </em>533 F.3d 1155, 1165 (9th Cir.2008) (\u201cMedical opinions that predate the alleged onset of disability are of limited relevance.\u201d); <em>see also </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1527(c)(4) (\u201cGenerally, the more consistent an opinion is with the record as a whole, the more weight we will give that opinion\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b715-5\">Brown contends that the ALJ erred by failing to credit the opinion of Dr. Mohinder Nijjar, whose examination supported a light RFC. We conclude that the ALJ provided \u201cspecific and legitimate reasons ... supported by substantial evidence in the record\u201d for rejecting Dr. Nijjar\u2019s opinion. <em>Lester v. Chater, </em>81 F.3d 821, 830-31 (9th Cir.1995). The ALJ noted that Dr. Nijjar\u2019s opinion conflicted with other medical testimony, and Brown offers no reason to credit Dr. Nijjar\u2019s assessment over other, more recent assessments. <em>See Burkhart v. Bowen, </em>856 F.2d 1335, 1339 (9th Cir. 1988) (approving ALJ\u2019s rejection of one medical opinion where claimant failed to explain why it deserved more weight than other opinions). \u201cWe have consistently held that \u2018questions of credibility and resolution of conflicts in the testimony are functions solely\u2019 of the [ALJ].\u201d <em>Saelee v. Chater, </em>94 F.3d 520, 522 (9th Cir.1996). Further, although Brown argues that the ALJ failed to distinguish between California worker\u2019s compensation terminology and Social Security terminology in addressing Dr. Linda Martinson\u2019s assessment, we conclude that the ALJ properly distinguished between the differing terminology by expressly addressing the issue with the vocational expert.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-6\">Brown\u2019s argument that the ALJ improperly rejected her subjective testimony is also without merit because the ALJ provided \u201cspecific, clear and convincing reasons for doing so.\u201d <em>Tommasetti v. Astrue, </em>533 F.3d 1035, 1039 (9th Cir.2008). The ALJ properly used \u201cordinary techniques of credibility evaluation.\u201d <em>Molina v. Astrue, </em>674 F.3d 1104, 1112 (9th Cir.2012) (internal quotation marks omitted). Those techniques included considering Brown\u2019s \u201cdismal\u201d work history; <em>Thomas v. Barnhart, </em>278 F.3d 947, 959 (9th Cir.2002); Brown\u2019s daily activities, which contradicted her testimony regarding the severity of her impairment, <em>Molina, </em>674 F.3d at 1112-13; and the ALJ\u2019s personal observations of Brown at the hearing, <em>Verduzco v. Apfel, </em>188 F.3d 1087, 1090 (9th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b715-8\">Finally, we agree that the ALJ erred by failing to consider the statement of a lay witness. <em>See Stout, </em>454 F.3d at 1053 (explaining that lay witness testimony <em>\u201ccannot </em>be disregarded without comment\u201d) (quoting <em>Nguyen v. Chater, </em>100 F.3d 1462, 1467 (9th Cir.1996)). Nevertheless, we affirm the Commissioner\u2019s decision because Brown has failed to carry her burden to show that this error was harmful. <em>Shinseki v. Sanders, </em>556 U.S. 396, 409, 129 S.Ct. 1696, 173 L.Ed.2d 532 (2009); <em>Molina, </em>674 F.3d at 1115-22. The statement at issue predates Brown\u2019s onset date by fifteen months, and does not describe any limitations beyond those raised in Brown\u2019s testimony, which the ALJ \u201cdiscussed at length and rejected.\u201d <em>Molina, </em>674 F.3d at 1122 (finding failure to address lay testimony harmless where statements did not allege any limitations beyond those described by claimant). Accordingly, the ALJ\u2019s failure to address the lay testimony was \u201cinconsequential to the ultimate non-disability determination.\u201d <em>Carmickle, </em>533 F.3d at 1162.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b714-23\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
