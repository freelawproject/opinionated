In February 2011, Blackett was sentenced to 36 months of imprisonment, to be followed by two years of supervised release.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Blackett appealed, and in May 2012, we affirmed the judgment and conviction. <em>See United States v. Blackett, </em>481 Fed.Appx. 741 (3d Cir.2012). On November 13, 2012, Blackett filed in the District Court a \u00a7 2255 motion. The Government filed a response to Blackett\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion on December 14, 2012. Blackett then filed several documents in the District Court in February, March, and April 2013. For example, on March 5, 2013, Blackett filed a motion for default judgment, which the Government responded to on March 13, 2013. Blackett\u2019s most recent filing, on April 12, 2013, sought a ruling on his pending motions. There has been no activity on the District Court\u2019s docket since then.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-22\">Mandamus is a drastic remedy available in extraordinary circumstances only. <em>In re Diet Drugs Prods. Liab. Litig., </em>418 F.3d 372, 378 (3d Cir.2005). A petitioner seeking the writ \u201cmust have no other adequate means to obtain the desired relief, and must show that the right to issuance is clear and indisputable.\u201d <em>Madden v. Myers, </em>102 F.3d 74, 79 (3d Cir.1996) <em>superseded in part on other grounds by </em>3d Cir. L.A.R. 24.1(c) (1997). Generally, a court\u2019s management of its docket is discretionary. <em>In re Fine Paper Antitrust Litig., </em>685 F.2d 810, 817 (3d Cir.2005). Due to the discretionary nature of docket management, there is no \u201cclear and indisputable\u201d right to have the District Court handle a case in a certain manner. <em>See Allied Chem. Corp. v. Daiflon, Inc., </em>449 U.S. 33, 36, 101 S.Ct. 188, 66 L.Ed.2d 193 (1980) (quoting <em>Bankers Life &amp; Cas. Co. v. Holland, </em>346 U.S. 379, 384, 74 S.Ct. 145, 98 L.Ed. 106 (1953)) (internal quotation marks omitted). However, mandamus may be warranted when a District Court\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>delay \u201cis tantamount to a failure to exercise jurisdiction.\u201d <em>Madden, </em>102 F.3d at 79.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-4\">In this case, Blackett\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion has been ripe for adjudication since December 2012. We are confident that the District Court will rule on the \u00a7 2255 motion without undue delay. For the foregoing reasons, we will deny the petition for a writ of mandamus.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b141-20\">. According to Blackett, his sentence of imprisonment will be completed on October 26, 2013.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
