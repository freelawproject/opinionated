He was designated a career offender and sentenced to forty-six months\u2019 imprisonment, to be served consecutive to his undischarged state court sentence. The court also imposed a three-year term <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>of supervised release. On appeal, Jacobs argues that his sentence is procedurally and substantively unreasonable. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-4\">We review Jacobs\u2019 sentence for reasonableness, applying an abuse of discretion standard. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 46, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). This review requires consideration of both the procedural and substantive reasonableness of the sentence. <em>Id. </em>at 51, 128 S.Ct. 586.- We first assess whether the district court properly calculated the advisory Guidelines range, considered the factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) (2006), analyzed any arguments presented by the parties, and sufficiently explained the selected sentence. <em>Id. </em>at 49-51, 128 S.Ct. 586; <em>see United States v. Lynn, </em>592 F.3d 572, 575-76 (4th Cir.2010). If there is no procedural error, we review the substantive reasonableness of the sentence, \u201cexamining] the totality of the circumstances to see whether the sentencing court abused its discretion in concluding that the sentence it chose satisfied the standards set forth in \u00a7 3553(a).\u201d <em>United States v. Mendoza-Mendoza, </em>597 F.3d 212, 216 (4th Cir.2010). If the sentence is within the defendant\u2019s properly calculated Guidelines range, we apply a presumption of substantive reasonableness. <em>United States v. Bynum, </em>604 F.3d 161, 168 (4th Cir.2010); <em>see Rita v. United States, </em>551 U.S. 338, 347, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007) (permitting appellate presumption of reasonableness for within-Guidelines sentence).</p>\n<p id=\"b428-5\">We discern no procedural or substantive infirmity in Jacobs\u2019 sentence. The district court properly computed Jacobs\u2019 Guidelines range, including the career offender designation, provided Jacobs and his counsel ample opportunity to speak in mitigation, and explained the sentence imposed by reference to the \u00a7 3553(a) factors it deemed most relevant in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-7\">Jacobs contends on appeal that the district court procedurally erred by failing to address whether his career offender designation overstated the seriousness of his conduct. Jacobs complains that the court \u201crelied almost exclusively on [his] admittedly bad criminal record\u201d without giving due consideration \u201cto the isolated and non-aggravated nature of his offense conduct.\u201d (Appellant\u2019s Br. at 14).</p>\n<p id=\"b428-8\">We disagree. In the course of analyzing the relevant \u00a7 3553(a) factors and explaining the reasons for the selected sentence, the district court adequately responded to counsel\u2019s arguments in favor of a reduced sentence to be served in conjunction with Jacobs\u2019 state court sentence. The sentencing court simply found that counsel\u2019s arguments were not persuasive when juxtaposed with Jacobs\u2019 history of violent conduct and demonstrated unwillingness to conform his behavior to the law, as well as the need to deter other inmates from engaging in similar acts. While we may have weighed the sentencing factors differently if tasked with resolving the issue in the first instance, we defer to the district court\u2019s well-reasoned decision. <em>See United States v. Jeffery, </em>631 F.3d 669, 679 (4th Cir.2011) (\u201c[District courts have extremely broad discretion when determining the weight to be given each of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b428-9\">Jacobs relies on the same basic premise to argue that his within-Guidelines sentence is substantively unreasonable. Our review of the record convinces us that a within-Guidelines sentence was justified in light of the totality of circumstances present in this case. We thus hold that the court did not abuse its discretion in selecting this sentence. <em>See United States v. Montes-Pineda, </em>445 F.3d 375, 379 (4th Cir.2006) (explaining that, to rebut the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>presumption of substantive reasonableness, defendant must show \u201cthat the sentence is unreasonable when measured against the \u00a7 3553(a) factors\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b429-5\">We accordingly affirm the judgment of the district court. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before this court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-6\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
