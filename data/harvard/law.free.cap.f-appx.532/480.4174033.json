Boone Pickens, a Cowboy board member and supporter (collectively, \u201cCowboy\u201d), purchased $10-million-dollar life insurance policies on each of twenty-seven OSU alumni. Plaintiff-Appellee Lincoln National Life Insurance Company (\u201cLincoln\u201d) underwrote the policies, which the Third Party Defendants-Appellees, as independent insurance agents, marketed to Cowboy as an investment program by claiming the ability to select individual insureds who were likely to die in a pattern that would beat the actuarial tables. After two years passed without the occurrence of any in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>sureds\u2019 deaths, Cowboy became dissatisfied with the program\u2019s lack of profitability, and the instant litigation ensued. The district court dismissed all of Cowboy\u2019s claims on summary judgment. We affirm for essentially the reasons set forth by the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-5\">Cowboy waived its rights with respect to its breach of contract claims. Oklahoma grants life insurance policyholders a \u201cfree-look\u201d period of ten days following receipt of the policy during which to read and, if dissatisfied, rescind the policy.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Cowboy knowingly and voluntarily relinquished its free-look rights by (1) declining physical delivery of the policies in favor of allowing the independent agents to retain custody, (2) misleading Lincoln as to that fact by signing and returning receipts of delivery to Lincoln, and (3) enjoying coverage \u2014 and the potential of receiving proceeds \u2014 for two years following the issuance of its policies by Lincoln.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b507-6\">With respect to fraud, the record reveals no triable misrepresentations. As a matter of Oklahoma law, representations about future events cannot support claims of actionable fraud.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> A fraud claim also fails if the aggrieved party \u201ccould have ascertained the truth with reasonable diligence.\u201d <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> This was not Cowboy\u2019s first rodeo. The undisputed record establishes that both the Appellees\u2019 disclosures and Cowboy\u2019s own due diligence apprised it of the inherent risks and assumptions underlying the investment program. To the extent that Cowboy hangs its hat on \u201cdoctored\u201d life expectancy numbers or other purported misrepresentations of present fact, the record evidence is woefully insufficient to support Cowboy\u2019s suggested inferences.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b507-16\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b506-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
