For the reasons that follow, we affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>I.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-5\">As relevant here, Allora, LLC, sued Cambridge Builders of Johnston County, Inc. (\u201cCBJC\u201d), in the Eastern District of North Carolina for infringement of a copyrighted home design.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Following the grant of summary judgment in its favor on the question of liability, Altara proceeded to trial against CBJC on the sole issue of damages. The jury returned a verdict awarding Altara $99,565.00 \u2014 the profits deemed attributable to CBJC\u2019s improper use of Allora\u2019s architectural plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-6\">Altara then moved the district court for $808,269.57 in attorneys\u2019 fees and costs. The court determined that an award was appropriate, but it found some of the rates and hours requested \u201cto be a bit excessive under the circumstances of this case,\u201d arriving at an award of $209,027.62\u2014 $208,667.25 for reasonable fees and $360.87 for certain costs.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> CBJC appeals only the fee component of the award.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-8\">The Copyright Act provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b377-9\">In any civil action under this title, the court in its discretion may allow the recovery of full costs by or against any party other than the United States or an officer thereof. Except as otherwise provided by this title, the court may also award a reasonable attorney\u2019s fee to the prevailing party as part of the costs.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b377-10\">17 U.S.C. \u00a7 505. We review an award of attorneys\u2019 fees under the Copyright Act for an abuse of discretion. <em>Diamond Star Bldg. Corp. v. Freed, </em>30 F.3d 503, 506 (4th Cir.1994). Factual findings may be reversed only if they are clearly erroneous. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b377-14\">As an initial matter, we have no doubt that the district court properly concluded that Altara constitutes a \u201cprevailing party\u201d eligible to receive a fee award under the Copyright Act in the first place. The Supreme Court has defined \u201cprevailing party\u201d in the fee-shifting context to mean a \u201cparty in whose favor a judgment is rendered, regardless of the amount of damages awarded.\u201d <em>Buckhannon Bd. &amp; Care Home, Inc. v. W. Va. Dep\u2019t of Health &amp; Human Res., </em>532 U.S. 598, 603, 121 S.Ct. 1835, 149 L.Ed.2d 855 (2001) (internal quotation marks omitted). As the district court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b377-15\">Altara defeated the defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment and prevailed on its own motion for partial summary judgment, the court finding no genuine issue of material fact that Altara owned a valid copyright in the [contested] design and that CBJC copied the plan without Allora\u2019s authorization. At a jury trial solely on the issue of damages, Altara once again prevailed, obtaining an award of almost $100,000 in actual damages and disgorged profits notwithstanding CBJC\u2019s evidence and arguments that it had not profited from the infringement.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b377-16\">Altara plainly satisfies the definition of a prevailing party.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-17\">Next, the district court correctly identified this circuit\u2019s four-prong standard for determining whether fees should be awarded to a prevailing party in a copyright case. Specifically, a court ought to consider \u201c(1) \u2018the motivation of the parties,\u2019 (2) \u2018the objective reasonableness of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>the legal and factual positions advanced,\u2019 (3) \u2018the need in particular circumstances to advance considerations of compensation and deterrence,\u2019 and (4) \u2018any other relevant factor presented.\u2019 \u201d <em>Diamond Star, </em>30 F.3d at 505-06 (quoting <em>Rosciszewski v. Arete Assocs., </em>1 F.3d 225, 234 (4th Cir. 1993)); <em>see also Fogerty v. Fantasy, Inc., </em>510 U.S. 517, 534 n. 19, 114 S.Ct. 1023, 127 L.Ed.2d 455 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b378-4\">Noting that it had \u201ccarefully considered all relevant factors,\u201d the district court found Allora\u2019s motivations \u201cpure\u201d and its legal and factual positions \u201creasonably sound.\u201d By contrast, the court reasoned that CBJC\u2019s \u201cutter failure to consider settlement, even after the court\u2019s summary judgment ruling,\u201d shows that it \u201cmay not have been acting in good faith in continuing to litigate.\u201d The court also characterized a number of CBJC\u2019s contentions as \u201cquestionable\u201d and, finally, noted the \u201cegregious nature\u201d of the underlying infringement. We have no reason to believe the district court\u2019s characterization was anything but sound.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-5\">Finally, as for the amount of a fee award under the Copyright Act, the district court again cited and applied the correct legal principles. In particular, \u201c[t]he most useful starting point for determining the amount of a reasonable fee is the number of hours reasonably expended on the litigation multiplied by a reasonable hourly rate,\u201d <em>Hensley v. Eckerhart, </em>461 U.S. 424, 433-34, 103 S.Ct. 1933, 76 L.Ed.2d 40 (1983) \u2014 an approach to fee determination known as the \u201clodestar\u201d method. Numerous considerations may prove pertinent to arriving at a final figure, among them:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ACx\">(1) the time and labor expended; (2) the novelty and difficulty of the questions raised; (3) the skill required to properly perform the legal services rendered; (4) the attorney\u2019s opportunity costs in pressing the instant litigation; (5) the customary fee for like work; (6) the attorney\u2019s expectations at the outset of the litigation; (7) the time limitations imposed by the client or circumstances; (8) the amount in controversy and the results obtained; (9) the experience, reputation and ability of the attorney; (10) the undesirability of the case within the legal community in which the suit arose; (11) the nature and length of the professional relationship between attorney and client; and (12) attorneys\u2019 fees awards in similar cases.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b378-7\"><em>Robinson v. Equifax Info. Servs., </em>560 F.3d 235, 243-44 (4th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b378-8\">The district court proceeded through the relevant factors with care, delivering a fair assessment of how each weighed in calculating the ultimate award. For example, although the court noted that \u201ccopyright law is a complex area,\u201d it also stated that \u201cthis particular case was not especially complex or novel in light of the blatant nature of the infringement.\u201d Moreover, the court did not blindly grant Allora\u2019s motion seeking over $300,000 in fees and costs but, rather, adjusted the award downward \u2014 to approximately $200,-000 \u2014 in order to render the judgment \u201creasonable\u201d with respect to both the expended hours and the assigned rates.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-9\">In conclusion, the district court applied the lodestar method in a sound manner under the circumstances of this case, and we accordingly find no abuse of discretion. The trial judge was familiar with both the pre-trial and trial proceedings and was thus in the best position to determine a reasonable award amount \u2014 including with respect to CBJC\u2019s primary arguments on appeal, which relate to the degree of success obtained by Allora and the adequacy of the evidence supporting the fee petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-10\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-11\">The Supreme Court has cautioned that a \u201crequest for attorney\u2019s fees should not re-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>suit in a second major litigation.\u201d <em>Hensley, </em>461 U.S. at 437, 103 S.Ct. 1933. Notwithstanding appellant\u2019s attempt to make this matter exactly that, we find no error in the district court\u2019s careful assessment of what constitutes a reasonable award in this case. The judgment is therefore affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-5\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b377-11\">. While another plaintiff, several defendants, and numerous claims were involved in this litigation below, the only issue before this court on appeal relates to the award of fees and costs pertaining to the listed entities and claim.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b377-19\">.
