We vacated the District Court\u2019s determination in part, but the Supreme Court reversed our decision and remanded the case for further review. We will now affirm the District Court\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-17\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-18\">The factual and procedural history of this case was recounted in detail by the Supreme Court in its recent opinion remanding this ease to our Court. <em>See As true v. Capato ex rel. B.N.C., </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 132 S.Ct. 2021, 2025-27, 182 L.Ed.2d 887 (2012). The Supreme Court instructed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>that \u201cthe law Congress enacted calls for resolution of Karen Capato\u2019s application for [the twins\u2019] insurance benefits by reference to state intestacy law.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 2034. Thus, we will address two questions. First, we must determine which state\u2019s law to apply. Second, we must decide whether that state\u2019s intestacy law would allow the twins to receive benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-5\">II. <footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b279-6\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-7\">To determine which state\u2019s law applies, we ask where Nick was domiciled at the time of his death. The Government argues that the administrative law judge (\u201cALJ\u201d) and District Court were correct to conclude that Nick was domiciled in Florida, where he lived for about three years immediately preceding his death. Capato argues that Nick was domiciled in Washington, the state where he was born and lived the majority of his life. Our decision turns on whether the ALJ\u2019s decision was \u201csupported by substantial evidence.\u201d <em>Hartranft v. Apfel, </em>181 F.3d 358, 360 (3d Cir. 1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b279-8\">\u201c[D]omicile is established by an objective physical presence in the state or territory coupled with a subjective intention to remain there indefinitely.\u201d <em>Washington v. Hovensa LLC, </em>652 F.3d 340, 344 (3d Cir. 2011). Intent to remain must be analyzed at the time of arrival in a new place: if a person is shown to have doubts about remaining in a new location after his arrival, those doubts are not relevant unless they indicate there was never an original intent to stay. <em>Gallagher v. Philadelphia Transp. Co., </em>185 F.2d 543, 546 (3d Cir. 1950).</p>\n<p id=\"b279-11\">There was sufficient evidence for the ALJ to conclude Nick was domiciled in Florida. Nick\u2019s business interests in Florida and the fact that his will was written under Florida law provide some indication of his intent, and his actual residence in Florida was prima facie evidence that Florida was his domicile. <em>See Krasnov v. Dinan, </em>465 F.2d 1298, 1300 (3d Cir.1972). And while all the testimony concerning the Capatos\u2019 intent to move to New Jersey was credited, the ALJ was free to decide that that evidence did not establish that Nick had a definite plan to leave Florida at the time he arrived from Colorado.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-12\">. B.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-13\">Because Nick was domiciled in Florida at the time of his death, we must \u201capply such law as would be applied in determining the devolution of intestate personal property by the courts of\u2019 Florida. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 416(h)(2)(A). Under Florida intestacy law, \u201c[a] child conceived from the eggs or sperm of a person or persons who died before the transfer of their eggs, sperm, or preembryos to a woman\u2019s body shall not be eligible for a claim against the decedent\u2019s estate unless the child has been provided for by the decedent\u2019s will.\u201d Fla. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 742.17(4). Capato\u2019s arguments to the contrary notwithstanding, \u00a7 742.17(4) clearly prevents recovery for the twins.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-14\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-15\">For these reasons, we will affirm the District Court\u2019s conclusion that the twins are not entitled to benefits under the Social Security Act.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b279-9\">. Under the law, a person is entitled to benefits if he or she is a \"child\u201d as defined by 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 416(e). <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 402(d)(1).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b279-16\">. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and the District Court was granted jurisdiction by 42 U.S.C. 405(g).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b280-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>VANASKIE, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"Aq4\">concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-4\">The results we reach in this case \u2014 that there is substantial evidence supporting the determination that Nick Capato was domiciled in Florida at the time of his passing, and that, as a consequence of this determination, the children of Nick and Karen Capato conceived after his passing are not entitled to Social Security surviv- or\u2019s benefits \u2014 are correct legally, and so I must concur. But the denial of survivor\u2019s benefits to Nick and Karen Capato\u2019s twins strikes me as grossly unfair.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-5\">The manifest unfairness of this case is the unfortunate consequence of legislation that was enacted generations before scientific and technological advances made it possible for couples like the Capatos to provide for a family even in the tragic circumstance of a death-sentence diagnosis of the wage earner. In 1939, when Congress first enacted legislation to provide for survivor benefits to the children of a wage earner, Congress was compelled to address the issue of who in fact was a child of the deceased wage earner for children born outside of wedlock when paternity and parentage status was not ascertainable with certainty. This concern for providing survivor benefits to children conceived and born outside a traditional marriage remained the focus of congressional attention in the 1960s, when section 216(h) of the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 416(h), was last amended by \u201cextending benefits to the children of unwed parents.\u201d <em>Schafer v. Astrue, </em>641 F.3d 49, 67 (4th Cir.2011) (Davis, J., dissenting). As explained in <em>McMillian ex rel. McMillian v. Heckler, </em>759 F.2d 1147 (4th Cir.1985):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b280-6\">Until 1965, \u00a7 416(h)(2) provided the sole means by which illegitimates could establish entitlement to benefits as dependent children, with \u00a7 (h)(2)(A) the primary vehicle. Under that provision, an illegitimate claimant could establish entitlement to benefits by proving his entitlement to inherit from the insured wage earner as a \u201cchild\u201d under the intestate succession law of the state of the insured\u2019s domicile. In 1965, \u00a7 (h)(3)(C) was added specifically to provide other means by which entitlement might be established.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b280-8\">Under the state inheritance law provisions of \u00a7 416(h)(2)(A), a claimant born in wedlock who sought to establish entitlement to benefits as the illegitimate child of another than his mother\u2019s husband was and is perforce confronted with any presumption of in-wedlock parentage integral to the state\u2019s inheritance law. That element of state law is necessarily included in the general congressional incorporation of state inheritance law into \u00a7 416(h)(2)(A).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b280-9\">But when \u00a7 416(h)(3)(C) was added in 1965 to provide supplementary and alternative means of proving entitlement by illegitimates, it did not expressly or by implication incorporate any element of state law respecting parentage, inheritance rights or any other matter of possible relevance to dependent child status. So far as the text of \u00a7 416(h)(3)(C) is concerned, all questions of its interpretation and application are referable solely to federal law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b280-10\"><em>Id. </em>at 1152 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b280-11\">Thus, the combination of sections 416(h)(2) and (h)(3)(C) assure that any child of a deceased wage earner born outside a traditional marriage while the wage earner is living has an opportunity, under a nationwide system, to receive benefits that are intended to \u201creplace the support that the child would have received from [the deceased parent] had the [parent] not died.\u201d <em>Jones ex rel. Jones v. Chater, </em>101 F.3d 509, 514 (7th Cir.1996). Such children are entitled to survivor benefits either if they qualify as heirs of the de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>ceased parent under the intestate laws of the state where the parent was domiciled at the time of his or her death, see 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 416(h)(2)(A), or, if not so qualified, by satisfying one of several nationally-applicable criteria. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 416(h)(3)(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b281-5\">Children conceived after the death of a parent, a consequence of scientific advances \u201cnot within the imagination, much less contemplation, of Congress when the relevant [legislative provisions] came to be,\u201d <em>Capato ex rel. B.N.C. v. Comm\u2019r of Social Security, </em>631 F.3d 626, 627 (3d Cir. 2011), <em>rev\u2019d, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 132 S.Ct. 2021, 182 L.Ed.2d 887 (2012), however, are relegated to the intestacy laws of the several states. Unlike \u201cout-of-wedlock\u201d children born before the death of the deceased wage earner, \u201cafter-conceived\u201d children have no alternative way to establish entitlement to survivor benefits. This means that some after-conceived children will receive survivor benefits because their parents were domiciled in states that recognize after-conceived children as heirs of their parents under their intestate laws, while others will be denied benefits solely because the intestate laws of the state where the wage earner passed away did not recognize his or her after-conceived children as heirs. And so we have a nationwide benefits program in which some after-conceived children of wage earners are treated as the children of their biological parents, while other after-conceived children are not regarded as the children of their biological parents. This strikes me as manifestly unfair.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-8\">Nick Capato was a fully-insured individual in a nationwide system that provides benefits to the children of fully-insured individuals. His offspring, whether conceived before or after his passing, should be entitled to the same treatment for survivor benefits that every other child born in the United States receives. There is no dispute that Nick Capato desired to provide for a family notwithstanding being stricken by a fatal disease. As it turned out, he was living in the -wrong state when he died to assure that his after-conceived children would receive the benefits of a national program into which he paid his fair share.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-10\">Where, as here, the record is clear as to the relationship between the claimant and the wage earner, eligibility for benefits in a nationwide program should not turn on the vagaries of the laws enacted by state legislators to address the completely separate matter of intestacy rights. Only Congress has the authority to remedy this situation. In 1965, Congress took action to remedy the inequity of relegating entitlement to survivor benefits to state intestacy laws by providing alternative means to qualify for such benefits. I write separately in this case to urge that Congress take appropriate action now to correct the injustice resulting from application of legislative provisions that could not have contemplated this \u201cnew world\u201d in which a father or mother may provide for a family even after his or her death. Until Congress does so, courts will be constrained to sustain manifestly unfair results that deny survivor benefits based solely upon the domicile of the wage earner.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
