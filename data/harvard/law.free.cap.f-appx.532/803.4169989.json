ANDERSON, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b830-5\">Petitioner and appellant, Richard Conway, an Oklahoma state prisoner proceeding <em>pro se, </em>seeks a certificate of appealability (\u201cCOA\u201d) to enable him to appeal the denial of his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 petition for a writ of habeas corpus. Finding that he has failed to meet the standards for the issuance of a COA, we deny him a COA and dismiss this matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-6\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b830-7\">Mr. Conway was convicted of first degree murder in Oklahoma state court and was sentenced to life imprisonment. The Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals (\u201cOCCA\u201d) affirmed the conviction by means of a summary opinion. <em>Conway v. State, </em>No. F-2011-107 (Okla.Crim.App. Apr. 26, 2012) (unpublished).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Mr. Conway filed the instant 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 petition for a writ of habeas corpus, arguing that (1) the trial court\u2019s failure to instruct on the defense of accident and misfortune and (2) the trial court\u2019s failure to instruct on the lesser-included offenses of first- and second-degree manslaughter deprived him of due process and a fair and impartial trial by jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-8\">The district court denied Mr. Conway\u2019s motion, concluding that the OCCA\u2019s decision was not contrary to or an unreasonable application of Supreme Court precedent under the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act (\u201cAED-PA\u201d). This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-10\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b830-11\">A COA is a jurisdictional prerequisite to our review of a petition for a writ of habeas corpus. <em>Miller-El v. Cockrell, </em>537 U.S. 322, 336, 123 S.Ct. 1029, 154 L.Ed.2d 931 (2003); <em>Clark v. Oklahoma, </em>468 F.3d 711, 713 (10th Cir.2006). A COA will issue \u201conly if the applicant has made a substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2). This standard requires \u201ca demonstration that ... includes showing that reasonable jurists could debate whether (or, for that matter, agree that) the [application] should have been resolved in a different manner or that the issues presented were adequate to deserve encouragement to proceed further.\u201d <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000) (internal quotation marks omitted). In evaluating whether Mr. Conway has carried his burden, we undertake \u201ca preliminary, though not definitive, consideration of the [legal] framework\u201d applicable to each of his claims. <em>Miller-El, </em>537 U.S. at 338, 123 S.Ct. 1029.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-12\">Furthermore, where, as in this case, the state court addressed the merits of a petitioner\u2019s claims, AEDPA provides the applicable standard of review. Its \u201cdeferential treatment of state court decisions must be incorporated into our consideration of a ... petitioner\u2019s request for a COA.\u201d <em>Dockins v. Hines, </em>374 F.3d 935, 938 (10th Cir.2004). Under AEDPA, habeas relief is available only if the state court decision was \u201ccontrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Su<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"805\">*805</page-number>preme Court of the United States,\u201d or \u201cwas based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the State court proceeding.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(1). \u201cThis highly deferential standard for evaluating state-court rulings demands that state-court decisions be given the benefit of the doubt.\u201d <em>Hooks v. Workman, </em>689 F.3d 1148, 1163 (10th Cir.2012) (further quotations omitted); <em>see Cullen v. Pinholster, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 131 S.Ct. 1388, 1398, 179 L.Ed.2d 557 (2011). Additionally, we presume under AEDPA that the state court\u2019s determination of a factual issue is correct; the applicant or petitioner has the burden of rebutting this presumption by clear and convincing evidence. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(e)(1); <em>Hooks, </em>689 F.3d at 1163.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-7\">The district court\u2019s decision applied this deferential standard to the OCCA\u2019s resolution of Mr. Conway\u2019s issues. Its analysis is thorough and complete. We cannot improve on it, and we therefore deny Mr. Conway a COA for substantially the reasons stated in the district court\u2019s decision, adopting the magistrate judge\u2019s report and recommendation.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-8\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b831-9\">For the foregoing reasons, we DENY a COA and DISMISS this matter. We DENY Mr. Conway\u2019s motion to proceed on appeal <em>in forma pauperis </em>and remind Mr. Conway that he is obligated to pay his filing fee in full.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b830-9\"> This order is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. It may be cited, however, for its persuasive value consistent with Fed. R.App. P. 32.1 and 10th Cir. R. 32.1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b830-13\">.
