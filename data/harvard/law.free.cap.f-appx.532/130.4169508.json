Liab. Litig., </em>418 F.3d 372, 378 (3d Cir.2005). A party seeking mandamus must show that he has \u201cno other adequate means to attain the relief he desires\u201d and that his right to the writ is \u201cclear and indisputable.\u201d <em>Hollingsworth v. Perry, </em>558 U.S. 183, 190, 130 S.Ct. 705, 175 L.Ed.2d 657 (2010) (per curiam) (quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b157-9\">In October 2012, the District Court denied Thomas\u2019 counseled motion to dismiss the charges against him based in part on his right to a speedy trial. To the extent Thomas intends to challenge that ruling he may not do so via a petition for a writ of mandamus. A mandamus petition is not a substitute for an appeal and may not be used to circumvent the final judgment rule.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>In re Baldwin, </em>700 F.3d 122, 127 (3d Cir.2012); <em>In re Kensington Int\u2019l Ltd., </em>353 F.3d 211, 219 (3d Cir.2003). If he is convicted, Thomas may challenge the District Court\u2019s interlocutory rulings by taking an appeal after entry of a final judgment. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Graves, </em>722 F.3d 544, 545-49 (3d Cir.2013) (reviewing Speedy Trial Act claim on direct appeal); <em>United States v. Willaman, </em>437 F.3d 354, 357-59 (3d Cir.2006) (same). Accordingly, we will deny the petition for a writ of mandamus.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b157-10\">. Although he is represented by counsel in the District Court, he has filed his mandamus petition pro se.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b157-11\">. A District Court\u2019s denial of a speedy trial motion is not immediately appealable. <em>United States v. Culbertson, </em>598 F.3d 40, 48 (2d Cir.2010) (\"a district court\u2019s order denying dismissal for an alleged violation of a defendant\u2019s right to a speedy trial is not reviewable on interlocutory appeal\u201d) (citing <em>United States v. MacDonald, </em>435 U.S. 850, 857, 98 S.Ct. 1547, 56 L.Ed.2d 18 (1978)); <em>cf. United States v. Kuper, </em>522 F.3d 302, 303-305 (3d Cir.2008) (holding that an order dismissing an indictment without prejudice pursuant to the Speedy Trial Act is not immediately appeal-able and may be appealed if defendant is re-indicted and convicted).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
