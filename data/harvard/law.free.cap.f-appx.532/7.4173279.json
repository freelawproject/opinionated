City Mar. 4, 2010). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-6\">Under the circumstances of this case, we review the decision of the IJ as modified and supplemented by the BIA. <em>See Yan Chen v. Gonzales, </em>417 F.3d 268, 271 (2d Cir.2005). The applicable standards of review are well-established. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>see also Yanqin Weng v. Holder, </em>562 F.3d 510, 513 (2d Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b34-7\">For applications such as Pan\u2019s, governed by the REAL ID Act of 2005, the agency may, considering the totality of the circumstances, base a credibility finding on the applicant\u2019s \u201cdemeanor, candor, or responsiveness,\u201d the plausibility of his account, and inconsistencies in his statements, without regard to whether they go \u201cto the heart of the applicant\u2019s claim.\u201d <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(l)(B)(iii); <em>Xiu Xia Lin v. Mukasey, </em>534 F.3d 162, 163-64, 165 (2d Cir.2008) (per curiam). We will \u201cdefer ... to an IJ\u2019s credibility determination unless, from the totality of the circumstances, it is plain that no reasonable fact-finder could make such\u201d a ruling. <em>Xiu Xia Lin, </em>534 F.3d at 167.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-8\">The IJ reasonably based her credibility finding on inconsistent testimony and omissions in Pan\u2019s supporting documentation, including the following: (1) Pan\u2019s testimony that his mother introduced him to her church in December 2006, though he later testified that he first attended church in April 2007; (2) Pan\u2019s testimony that he and his family attended the same church and then \u201csplit\u201d into different churches, though he later testified that he had never attended his mother\u2019s or siblings\u2019 church; (3) Pan\u2019s testimony that his parents paid a fine to release him from jail though he later testified that his mother alone had paid the fine and the fine receipt reflected that he himself had paid the fine; (4) an omission in a letter from Pan\u2019s pastor, which did not mention Pan\u2019s alleged arrest for distributing religious flyers in China; and (5) an omission in a letter from Pan\u2019s father, which did not mention the alleged fine imposed against Pan. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1158(b)(l)(B)(iii), 1231(b)(3)(C); <em>Xiu Xia Lin, </em>534 F.3d at 167. The IJ was not required to credit Pan\u2019s explanations for these inconsistencies. <em>See Majidi v. Gonzales, </em>430 F.3d 77, 81 (2d Cir.2005). In addition, the adverse credibility determination is further supported by the IJ\u2019s demeanor finding based on Pan\u2019s non-responsive and hesitant testimony. <em>See Li Hua Lin v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>453 F.3d 99, 109 (2d Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b34-10\">Given the inconsistent testimony, omissions, and the IJ\u2019s demeanor finding, the totality of the circumstances supports the agency\u2019s adverse credibility. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(l)(B)(iii); <em>Xiu Xia Lin, </em>534 F.3d at 167. Because the only evidence of a threat to Pan\u2019s life or freedom from persecution or torture depended upon his credibility, the adverse credibility determination in this case necessarily precludes success on his claim for withholding of removal and CAT relief. <em>See Paul v. Gonzales, </em>444 F.3d 148, 156 (2d Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b35-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
