He asserts that the district court plainly erred in applying a sixteen-level enhancement pursuant to U.S. Sentencing Guidelines \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(i).</p>\n<p id=\"b526-20\">Because Argueta-Padilla did not object to the enhancement in the district court, review is limited to plain error. <em>See Puckett v. United States, </em>556 U.S. 129, 135, 129 S.Ct. 1423, 173 L.Ed.2d 266 (2009). To show plain error, Argueta-Padilla must show a forfeited error that is clear or obvious and that affects his substantial rights. <em>See id. </em>If he makes such a showing, this court has the discretion to correct the error, but only if it seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings. <em>Henderson v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 133 S.Ct. 1121, 1123, 185 L.Ed.2d 85 (2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b526-23\">Argueta-Padilla concedes that his conviction of count one in Maryland Case No. 105209C for distribution of a controlled dangerous substance qualifies as a drug-trafficking offense. In view of that concession, he cannot show any error, much less plain error, in the application of the enhancement. Argueta-Padilla\u2019s motion to withdraw counsel and appoint new counsel is DENIED.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-24\">The judgment of sentence is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b526-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
