Petitioner complains that the district court improperly determined that: (a) Defendant maintained a forfeitable interest in Greenbriar; (b) Petitioner did not maintain a legal interest in the residence; and (c) absent her own legal interest, Petitioner was not otherwise in a position to challenge the forfeiture of Defendant\u2019s property interest. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we reverse.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b760-25\">\u201cUpon a finding that the property involved is subject to forfeiture, a court must promptly enter a preliminary order of forfeiture without regard to a third party\u2019s interests in the property.\u201d <em>United States v. Lazarenko, </em>476 F.3d 642, 648 (9th Cir. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"735\">*735</page-number>2007). \u201c[A] court adjudicates a third party\u2019s interest in the forfeited property in an ancillary proceeding after concluding the criminal case and entering a preliminary order of forfeiture.\u201d 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 85S(n). \u201cAny person, other than the defendant, asserting a legal interest in property which has been ordered forfeited to the United States ... may ... petition the court for a hearing to adjudicate the validity of his alleged interest in the property.\u201d 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 853(n)(2). The court shall amend any forfeiture order if a third party establishes she \u201chas a legal right, title, or interest in the property\u201d that \u201cwas vested in the petitioner rather than the defendant or was superior to any right, title, or interest of the defendant at the time of the commission of the acts which gave rise to the forfeiture of the property....\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 853(d)(6)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b761-6\">Ashken claims a legal interest in Greenbriar as the beneficiary of an oral trust. Under California law, \u201can oral trust in real property\u201d is enforceable when the trustee recognizes the trust as valid and voluntarily carries out the trust obligations. <em>See Cardoza v. White, </em>219 Cal. 474, 476, 27 P.2d 639 (1933); <em>see also </em>13 Witkin, <em>Summary of California Law, Trusts </em>\u00a7 28, at 599 (10th ed.2012) (\u201cAn oral trust in real property is not void, but only unenforceable when its invalidity is urged by the party to be charged. Hence, only the trustee and the trustee\u2019s successors may take advantage of the statute [of frauds]\u201d to establish its invalidity.). There is evidence in the record that the trustee willingly performed his duties under the oral trust. Indeed, the only party disputing the existence and timing of the trust is the Government. Accordingly, there are genuine issues of material fact as to whether Ashken has the requisite legal interest in the Greenbriar property under California law, and the district court erred in rejecting her petition on summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-10\">REVERSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b760-18\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
