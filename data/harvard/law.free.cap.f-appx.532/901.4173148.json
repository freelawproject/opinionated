The Commission filed an amended complaint that Carroll\u2019s terminated Terilyn Holliday because of her sex, in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-2. Carroll\u2019s moved for summary judgment, and the Commission responded that Carroll\u2019s acted with mixed motives and gender was one factor that motivated Carroll\u2019s to fire Holliday, <em>see id. </em>\u00a7 2000e-2(m). The district court refused to address the issue of mixed motives on the ground that it was untimely raised, and the district court granted summary judgment in favor of Carroll\u2019s. Although the district court erred when it failed to consider the argument of the Commission about mixed motives, the district court correctly entered summary judgment in favor of Carroll\u2019s because there was no genuine factual dispute that its decisionmaker did not act with a discriminatory motive. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b928-12\">We review <em>de novo </em>the summary judgment in favor of Carroll\u2019s and view the evidence in the light most favorable to the Commission, the nonmoving party. <em>See Stimpson v. City of Tuscaloosa, </em>186 F.3d 1328, 1331 (11th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b928-13\">The district court erred by refusing to consider the argument of the Commission that Carroll\u2019s acted with mixed motives. The Commission was entitled to offer evidence that Carroll\u2019s had mixed motives when it committed \u201can unlawful employment practice,\u201d in violation of Title VII, by \u201cdischarging] [Holliday] ... because of her sex,\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-2(a)(l). Section 2000e-2 provides that one way in which \u201can unlawful employment practice is established [is] when [a plaintiff] demonstrates that ... sex ... was a motivating factor for any employment practice, even though other factors also motivated the practice.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 2000e-2(m). The Commission was not required to identify its method of proof in its complaint. A complaint need contain only \u201ca short and plain statement of the claim showing that the plaintiff is entitled to relief,\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 8(a)(2), and \u201cneed not pin [the] plaintiffs claim for relief to a precise legal theory,\u201d <em>Skinner v. Switzer, </em>562 U.S. \u2014, 131 S.Ct. 1289, 1296, 179 L.Ed.2d 233 (2011). As explained in <em>Price Waterhouse v. Hopkins, </em>490 U.S. 228, 109 S.Ct. 1775, 104 L.Ed.2d 268 (1989), a plaintiff should not be required to \u201clabel[ ] [her complaint] as either a \u2018pretext\u2019 case or a \u2018mixedmotives\u2019 case from the beginning in the District Court\u201d because \u201c[discovery often [is] necessary before [she] can know whether both legitimate and illegitimate considerations played a part in the decision against her.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"903\">*903</page-number><em>Id. </em>at 247 n. 12, 109 S.Ct. at 1789 n. 12. The Commission had only to argue that the \u201ccase involve[d] mixed motives ... [a]t some point in the proceedings,\u201d <em>id., </em>which it did in its response to the motion of Carroll\u2019s for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b929-5\">But the district court did not err by entering summary judgment in favor of Carroll\u2019s. The Commission argues that, after the decision of the Supreme Court in <em>Desert Palace, Inc. v. Costa, </em>539 U.S. 90, 123 S.Ct. 2148, 156 L.Ed.2d 84 (2003), a claim of discrimination based on proof of mixed motives is not governed by the burden-shifting framework established in <em>McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, </em>411 U.S. 792, 93 S.Ct. 1817, 36 L.Ed.2d 668 (1973), but we need not decide that issue because the Commission failed to create a genuine factual dispute that Carroll\u2019s fired Holliday, even in part, because of her gender. Although Holliday\u2019s regional manager, James McCullough, allegedly twice stated that he wanted Holliday denied promotions and fired because she was a woman in management, McCullough did not fire Holliday. Steve Wommack testified that he fired Holliday because she had sought employment elsewhere and refused to work with her new branch manager, Richard Ramirez. <em>See Pennington v. City of Huntsville, </em>261 F.3d 1262, 1270 (11th Cir.2001). The Commission argues that Wommack was a \u201cmere conduit, or cat\u2019s paw,\u201d for McCullough\u2019s discrimination, but Wommack independently confirmed the information on which he based his decision to fire Holliday. <em>See Stimpson, </em>186 F.3d at 1332. Wommack testified that he had several conversations with Ramirez about Holliday being disrespectful to him and disregarding company policies that prohibited sales to end users and that limited the number of smoke breaks. The Commission offered no evidence to the contrary. The Commission also argues that Ramirez failed to issue a final written warning to Holliday in compliance with its progressive disciplinary policy, but it is undisputed that Carroll\u2019s often failed to follow that policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b929-7\">We AFFIRM the summary judgment in favor of Carroll\u2019s.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
