Brown\u2019s motion was based on Amendment 750 to the Sentencing Guidelines, which lowered the base offense levels for crack cocaine violations. The district court denied Brown\u2019s motion averring that, because he was sentenced as a career offender under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1, Amendment 750 did not have the effect of lowering Brown\u2019s Guidelines range. Relying on the plurality opinion in <em>Freeman v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 131 S.Ct. 2685, 180 L.Ed.2d 519 (2011), Brown argues his career offender sentence was \u201cbased on\u201d a sentencing range that has been lowered by the Sentencing Commission and thus he is eligible for a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) sentence reduction. After review,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> we affirm the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-10\">District courts may not modify a term of imprisonment unless a defendant was sentenced \u201cbased on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). Defendants classified as career offenders are given base offense levels pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1, not pursuant to the drug quantity tables in \u00a7 2D1.1. <em>See United States v. Moore, </em>541 F.3d 1323, 1327-28. Therefore, a retroactive amendment to the drug quantity table in \u00a7 2D1.1 does not result in a reduction of a career offender\u2019s base offense levels under the meaning of \u00a7 3582(c)(2), and district courts are not authorized to reduce sentences on that basis. See <em>id. </em>at 1327-28, 1330.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-14\">In <em>Freeman, </em>a defendant entered into a Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(c)(1)(C) plea agreement that recommended the defendant serve a particular sentence. 131 S.Ct. at 2690 (2011). Justice Sotomayor\u2019s controlling opinion<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> stated a defendant may have a sentence reduced only when the plea agreement uses \u201ca Guidelines sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission. ...\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2695. Therefore, a sentence can only be lowered if the plea agreement itself was \u201cbased on\u201d the applicable Guidelines range. <em>Id. </em>at 2695-2700. We recently held in <em>United States v. Lawson, </em>686 F.3d 1317 (11th Cir.2012), that <em>Moore </em>was not overruled by <em>Freeman </em>because <em>Freeman </em>did not address \u201cdefendants who were assigned a base offense level under one guideline section, but who were ultimately assigned a total offense level and guideline range under \u00a7 4B1.1.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1321 (citations omitted) (internal quotation marks omitted). Therefore, <em>Moore </em>is still controlling precedent in this Circuit. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b925-15\">The district court correctly denied Brown\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion because his Guideline range as a career offender is not affected by Amendment 750. We reaffirmed in <em>Lawson </em>that defendants sentenced as career offenders are not eligible <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"900\">*900</page-number>for sentencing reductions under \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>See Lawson, </em>686 F.3d at 1321; <em>Moore, </em>541 F.3d at 1329-30. Thus, we affirm the district court\u2019s denial.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b926-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b925-11\">. In a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceeding, we review <em>de novo </em>the district court's legal conclusions regarding the scope of its authority. <em>United States v. Lawson, 686 </em>F.3d 1317, 1319 (11th Cir.2012).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b925-16\">. Where no majority exists, the Justice who concurred on the narrowest grounds is viewed as the controlling opinion. <em>Lawson, 686 </em>F.3d at 1321 n. 2 (quoting <em>Marks v. United States, </em>430 U.S. 188, 97 S.Ct. 990, 993, 51 L.Ed.2d 260 (1977)).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b926-16\">. We further reject Brown's contention the district court erred by denying his motion because he is subject to the new mandatory minimum penalties under the Fair Sentencing Act (FSA). The FSA amendment would not retroactively apply in Brown\u2019s case. <em>See United States v. Berry, </em>701 F.3d 374 (11th Cir.2012) (rejecting defendant's argument he was eligible for \u00a7 3582(c)(2) relief under the FSA because the FSA is not a guidelines amendment, but rather is a statutory change by Congress); <em>United States v. Hippolyte, </em>712 F.3d 535 (11th Cir.2013) (reaffirming the conclusion in <em>Berry </em>that the FSA does not apply to defendants sentenced before its effective date).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
