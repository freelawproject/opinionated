R.App. P. 34(a)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b682-4\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b682-5\">Michael Seneca appeals pro se from the district court\u2019s judgment dismissing his action alleging, among other things, violations of the Truth in Lending Act and the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review de novo a dismissal for lack of standing. <em>Del. Valley Surgical Supply Inc. v. Johnson &amp; Johnson, </em>523 F.3d 1116, 1119 (9th Cir.2008). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-6\">Seneca\u2019s claims remain property of his Chapter 7 bankruptcy estate because they accrued before Seneca filed his bankruptcy petition but were never scheduled or otherwise administered in his bankruptcy case. <em>See </em>11 U.S.C. \u00a7 554(d) (\u201cUnless the court orders otherwise, property of the estate that is not abandoned under this section and that is not administered in the case remains property of the estate.\u201d); <em>Canatella v. Towers (In re Alcala), </em>918 F.2d 99, 102 (9th Cir.1990) (causes of action which accrued before Chapter 7 petition is filed are part of the estate vested in the trustee); <em>see also Cheng v. K &amp; S Diversified In, Inc. (In re Cheng), </em>308 B.R. 448, 461 (9th Cir. BAP 2004) (\u201cProperty of the estate that is not scheduled or otherwise administered by the time the case is closed remains property of the estate forever.\u201d). Accordingly, the district court properly dismissed Seneca\u2019s action because Seneca is not the real party in interest and has no standing to pursue his claims. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 17(a)(1) (\u201cAn action must be prosecuted in the name of the real party in interest.\u201d); <em>see also Estate of Spirtos v. One San Bernardino Cnty. Superior Court Case Numbered SPR 02211, </em>443 F.3d 1172, 1176 (9th Cir.2006) (bankruptcy code endows bankruptcy trustee with exclusive right to sue on behalf of estate).</p>\n<p id=\"b682-9\">Seneca\u2019s contentions concerning the lack of oral argument, the propriety of removal to federal court, the adequacy of the district court\u2019s explanation of its conclusions, and the district court\u2019s consideration of judicially-noticed bankruptcy court orders are unpersuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b682-7\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
