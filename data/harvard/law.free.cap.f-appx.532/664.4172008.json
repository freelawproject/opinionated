We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review the agency\u2019s factual findings for substantial evidence, <em>Zhou v. Gonzales, </em>437 F.3d 860, 864 (9th Cir.2006), and we deny the petition for review.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b690-23\">Cisneros does not challenge the BIA\u2019s holding that he was convicted of an aggravated felony, and he therefore is ineligible for asylum. <em>See Martinez-Serrano v. INS, </em>94 F.3d 1256, 1259-60 (9th Cir.1996) (holding that issues not specifically raised and argued in a party\u2019s opening brief are waived); <em>see also </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1158(b)(2)(A)(ii), 1158(b)(2)(B)(i); <em>Lopez-Cardona v. Holder, </em>662 F.3d 1110, 1111-12 (9th Cir.2011) (recognizing that a conviction for an aggravated felony makes an alien statutorily ineligible for asylum).</p>\n<p id=\"b690-24\">Cisneros contends that, when deciding that he was ineligible for withholding of removal, the IJ and BIA were required to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"665\">*665</page-number>determine whether his prior conviction constituted a particularly serious crime. We reject that contention because it was not necessary for either the IJ or the BIA to determine whether Cisneros was convicted of a particularly serious crime since both the IJ and the BIA determined that Cisneros failed to meet his burden of proof for withholding of removal. <em>See INS v. Bagamasbad, </em>429 U.S. 24, 25, 97 S.Ct. 200, 50 L.Ed.2d 190 (1976) (\u201cAs a general rule courts and agencies are not required to make findings on issues the decision of which is unnecessary to the results they reach.\u201d); <em>see also Simeonov v. Ashcroft, </em>371 F.3d 532, 538 (9th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b691-5\">Cisneros relies on <em>Matter of Chen, </em>20 I. &amp; N. Dec. 16 (BIA 1989), to argue that he is entitled to CAT relief because of his past experiences in Guatemala. This reliance on <em>Chen </em>is misplaced. <em>Chen </em>has been codified at 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(b)(l)(iii)(A), which is limited to claims for asylum and does not apply to applicants such as Cisneros who have been convicted of aggravated felonies. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 208.13(b)(l)(iii)(A) &amp; (c)(2)(i)(D). Cisneros does not contend that the record compels a finding that it is more likely that not that, if he is removed, he will be tortured. He therefore has waived that issue. <em>See Martinez-Serrano, </em>94 F.3d at 1259-60.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-8\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b690-25\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
