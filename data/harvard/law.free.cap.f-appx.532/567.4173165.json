Pursuant to <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007), we engage in a bifurcated analysis of the sentence. <em>United States v. Delgado-Martinez, </em>564 F.3d 750, 752 (5th Cir.2009). Under that standard, we first examine whether the district court committed any procedural errors, \u201csuch as failing to calculate (or improperly calculating) the Guidelines range, treating the Guidelines as mandatory, failing to consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, selecting a sentence based on clearly erroneous facts, or failing to adequately explain the chosen sentence.\u201d <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 51, 128 S.Ct. 586. If the district court\u2019s decision is procedurally sound, we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>then \u201cconsider the substantive reasonableness of the sentence imposed under an abuse-of-discretion standard, ... tak[ing] into account the totality of the circumstances.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b595-5\">Lopez-Moreno raises three procedural challenges to his sentence. He first contends that the district court based the sentence on an erroneous assumption that Lopez-Moreno received a sentence of 10 years\u2019 probation on a prior conviction for attempted sexual battery of a minor because the state court determined that he was going to be deported and thus no longer a problem in the United States. The first error resulted in a second and related error, Lopez-Moreno asserts, because the district court refused to consider the mitigating facts he presented. Lopez-Moreno did not raise these issues in the district court and we thus review only for plain error. <em>See Puckett v. United States, </em>556 U.S. 129, 135, 129 S.Ct. 1423, 173 L.Ed.2d 266 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b595-6\">Lopez-Moreno fails to explain, much less show, how the district court\u2019s suggested explanation for the prior sentence is a clearly erroneous fact or that it was the basis of his sentence in the instant matter. The record indicates that the district court provided numerous reasons for the sentence, from which recitation the above statement was only a brief digression. Specifically, the district court noted the serious nature of Lopez-Moreno\u2019s pri- or convictions and the potential that Lopez-Moreno would commit future offenses. The district court determined that Lopez-Moreno\u2019s criminal history was greatly under-represented in light of the severity of his prior offenses, the relatively light penalties for those offenses, and the fact that several of the prior convictions were not counted in arriving at the advisory guidelines sentencing range. Further, the district court determined that those prior sentences had failed to provide a deterrent to future criminal conduct and concluded that Lopez-Moreno presented a danger to the public. As to the mitigating facts Lopez-Moreno offered in regard to his prior conviction for attempted sexual battery of a minor, which consisted of his own statement that there had been no evidence he committed the offense and that he had only pleaded guilty in order to be released from prison on a sentence of probation, the district court indicated that it considered his statement but found the detailed records of the plea and conviction more credible than his denials of guilt. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) (setting forth the factors courts must consider in imposing sentences).</p>\n<p id=\"b595-8\">In his third procedural challenge to his sentence, which challenge he preserved, Lopez-Moreno contends that the district court failed to adequately explain the above-guidelines sentence. \u201cCongress requires the sentencing court to state \u2018the reasons for its imposition of the particular sentence.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Mondragon-Santiago, </em>564 F.3d 357, 362 (5th Cir.2009) (citation omitted) (quoting \u00a7 3553(c)). While sentences within the Guidelines require \u201clittle explanation,\u201d the district court must more thoroughly articulate its reasons when it imposes a non-guidelines sentence. <em>United States v. Gomez-Herrera, </em>523 F.3d 554, 564-65 (5th Cir.2008); <em>see also Rita v. United States, </em>551 U.S. 338, 357-59, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007). The district court\u2019s reasons \u201cshould be fact specific and consistent\u201d with the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>United States v. Smith, </em>440 F.3d 704, 707 (5th Cir.2006) (citation omitted). We have held that there is no error if the sentencing record reveals the reasons for the sentence imposed and permits effective review by the appellate court. <em>United States v. Key, </em>599 F.3d 469, 474-75 (5th Cir.2010). As illustrated by the discussion above, the district <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>court provided a detailed explanation of how it arrived at the sentence and its analysis of the sentencing factors of \u00a7 3553(a). Because the district court sufficiently articulated its reasons for imposing the sentence, Lopez-Moreno has shown no error. <em>See Key, </em>599 F.3d at 474.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-4\">As to the substantive reasonableness of his sentence, Lopez-Moreno argues that the district court abused its discretion when it determined that a 96-month sentence was the least sentence necessary to fulfill the purposes of sentencing. The Government argues that Lopez-Moreno\u2019s assertion at sentencing that the sentence was \u201cgreater than necessary to achieve the statutory purposes of 3553(a)\u201d was insufficient to alert the court to the specific reasonableness challenges he raises in this court and the claim should thus only be reviewed for plain error. We need not determine whether plain error review is appropriate, however, because Lopez-Moreno\u2019s arguments fail even under the abuse-of-discretion standard. <em>See United States v. Rodriguez, </em>523 F.3d 519, 525 (5th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b596-5\">In reviewing a non-guidelines sentence for substantive reasonableness, we consider \u201cthe totality of the circumstances, including the extent of any variance from the Guidelines range.\u201d <em>United States v. Brantley, </em>537 F.3d 347, 349 (5th Cir.2008) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). We review whether the \u00a7 3553(a) factors support the sentence and give deference to the district court\u2019s determination that the \u00a7 3553(a) factors justify the variance. <em>Id. </em>\u201cA sentence is unreasonable if it (1) does not account for a factor that should have received significant weight, (2) gives significant weight to an irrelevant or improper factor, or (3) represents a clear error of judgment in balancing the sentencing factors.\u201d <em>United States v. Peltier, </em>505 F.3d 389, 392 (5th Cir.2007) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b596-7\">Before imposing the sentence, the district court considered the advisory guidelines range, the statutory penalties, the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, the facts set forth in the PSR, Lopez-Moreno\u2019s statement, and Lopez-Moreno\u2019s arguments at sentencing (the Government made no arguments). The district court made an individualized assessment and concluded that the guidelines range did not adequately take into account the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, including the nature and circumstances of Lopez-Moreno\u2019s offense in light of his criminal history, Lopez-Moreno\u2019s history and characteristics, the need to afford adequate deterrence, and the need to protect the public. Athough Lopez-Moreno\u2019s 96-month sentence is 39 months greater than the top of the 46-57-month guidelines range, we have upheld variances greater than the increase to his sentence. <em>See Brantley, </em>537 F.3d at 348-50 (upholding a variance to concurrent terms of 120 months and 180 months from a guidelines range of 41 to 51 months); <em>United States v. Jones, </em>444 F.3d 430, 433, 441-42 (5th Cir.2006) (affirming an upward departure to 120 months from a guidelines range of 46 to 57 months); <em>United States v. Smith, </em>417 F.3d 483, 492 (5th Cir.2005) (upholding departure to 120-month sentence where maximum of guidelines range was 41 months); <em>United States v. Daughenbaugh, </em>49 F.3d 171, 174-75 (5th Cir.1995) (affirming departure from guidelines maximum of 71 months to sentence of 240 months).</p>\n<p id=\"b596-8\">Lopez-Moreno\u2019s arguments do not show a clear error of judgment on the district court\u2019s part in balancing the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>See Peltier, </em>505 F.3d at 392. Instead, they constitute a mere disagreement with the district court\u2019s weighing of those factors. Given the significant deference that is due to a district court\u2019s consid<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>eration of the \u00a7 3558(a) factors and the district court\u2019s reasons for its sentencing decision, Lopez-Moreno has not demonstrated that the sentence is substantively unreasonable. <em>See Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 50-53, 128 S.Ct. 586; <em>Brantley, </em>537 F.3d at 349.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-5\">For these reasons, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b594-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
