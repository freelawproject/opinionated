For the reasons that follow, we will deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-7\">In 1993, Andrews was convicted of federal drug and weapons offenses arising out of his participation in a drug-trafficking organization. Andrews was sentenced to life in prison on the drug offenses, plus a 40-year term of imprisonment based on two violations of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c). We affirmed the judgment on direct appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-8\">In 2001, Andrews filed a motion to vacate sentence pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. The District Court denied the motion because it was untimely filed and we denied Andrews\u2019 request for a certificate of appealability. In 2008, Andrews filed a motion pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). The District Court reduced his life sentence to 360 months in prison based on amendments to the Sentencing Guidelines for crack cocaine offenses. Andrews\u2019 40-year consecutive sentence was not affected.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-9\">In 2009, Andrews filed a motion pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b) seeking relief from the denial of his \u00a7 2255 motion. The District Court dismissed the motion as an unauthorized second or successive \u00a7 2255 motion. We granted a certificate of appealability and, on February 29, 2012, ruled that the District Court had erred because Andrews\u2019 motion challenged the District Court\u2019s decision that his \u00a7 2255 motion was untimely and did not challenge a resolution of the merits of his claims. We remanded the matter to District Court to decide the merits of the Rule 60(b) motion. <em>See </em>C.A. No. 10-2088.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b155-12\">This Court\u2019s judgment was filed in District Court on April 23, 2012. On June 14, 2012, the District Court issued an order directing the parties to file memoranda addressing whether Andrews\u2019 Rule 60(b) motion should be granted. Both Andrews and the Government filed responses. On November 1, 2012, the District Court appointed Andrews counsel. The District Court then denied Andrews\u2019 Rule 60(b) motion \u201cwithout prejudice subject to his right to file a counseled Rule 60(b) motion.\u201d Dist. Ct. Order entered 11/28/12.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-13\">Counsel, however, did not file a Rule 60(b) motion and, on February 7, 2013, Andrews filed in District Court a \u201cNotice of Appearance as Pro-se Litigant under Title 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1654\u201d asking to remove his counsel of record, proceed <em>pro se </em>\u201cwith assistance of counsel,\u201d and re-instate his <em>pro se </em>filings. Shortly thereafter, Andrews filed a copy of a letter he had sent his court-appointed counsel stating, among other things, that he had been unable to reach him and that counsel had not contacted him since his appointment.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-14\">There was no further docket activity in Andrews\u2019 case until April 16, 2013, when Andrews filed a one-sentence \u201cLetter Motion\u201d asking that nothing be submitted to the Court on his behalf by any attorney without his approval. On July 11, 2013, Andrews filed another \u201cNotice of Appearance as pro-se Litigant Under Title 28 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>U.S.C. \u00a7 1654\u201d again asking to remove his counsel of record, proceed <em>pro se </em>\u201cwith assistance of counsel,\u201d and re-instate his earlier <em>pro se </em>filings. Andrews further asked the District Court to address the questions set forth in this Court\u2019s earlier decision and the District Court\u2019s June 14, 2012 order. No action has been taken on this filing.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-4\">Andrews then filed a mandamus petition in this Court asking us to compel the District Court to adjudicate his Rule 60(b) motion based on his <em>pro se </em>filings. Andrews states that he has not heard from his court-appointed counsel and that he should not be compelled to accept his representation. Andrews also asks this Court to compel the District Court to rule on matters related to the disposition of his Rule 60(b) motion, including an earlier motion for extension of time to file his \u00a7 2255 motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-5\">Mandamus relief is available in extraordinary circumstances. <em>See In re Diet Drugs Prods. Liab. Litig., </em>418 F.3d 372, 378 (3d Cir.2005). A petitioner must show that \u201c(1) no other adequate means [exist] to attain the relief he desires, (2) the party\u2019s right to issuance of the writ is clear and indisputable, and (3) the writ is appropriate under the circumstances.\u201d <em>Hollingsworth v. Perry, </em>558 U.S. 183, 190, 130 S.Ct. 705, 175 L.Ed.2d 657 (2010) (per curiam) (quotation marks omitted). A writ of mandamus may be appropriate when a district court\u2019s \u201cundue delay is tantamount to a failure to exercise jurisdiction.\u201d <em>Madden v. Myers, </em>102 F.3d 74, 79 (3d Cir. 1996). <em>See also Johnson v. Rogers, </em>917 F.2d 1283, 1285 (10th Cir.1990) (granting writ of mandamus where habeas petition was pending for 14 months).</p>\n<p id=\"b156-6\">The District Court acted promptly when this case was remanded, but we agree with Andrews that the resolution of his Rule 60(b) motion has been delayed since he was appointed counsel on November 28, 2012. Andrews appears to have tried to call attention to the fact that appointed counsel has not filed a Rule 60(b) motion on his behalf in his District Court filings in February and July of this year. We do not find, however, that there has been undue delay by the District Court in addressing these filings at this point in time. Andrews\u2019 second \u201cnotice,\u201d which explicitly asked for a ruling on the questions set forth in our earlier decision, was filed shortly before this mandamus petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-8\">Accordingly, we will deny the petition for a writ of mandamus without prejudice to Andrews filing a new mandamus petition if the District Court does not act on his filings within a reasonable time.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b155-10\">. We set forth several questions for the District Court\u2019s consideration on remand, including whether Andrews\u2019 innocence under <em>Bailey v. United States, </em>516 U.S. 137, 116 S.Ct. 501, 133 L.Ed.2d 472 (1995), with respect to one of his violations of \u00a7 924(c) constitutes \"extraordinary circumstances\u201d permitting Rule 60(b) relief.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
