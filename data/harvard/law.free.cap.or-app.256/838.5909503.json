Claimant also challenges the board\u2019s conclusion that he is not entitled to a penalty and attorney fees based on SAIF\u2019s refusal to award a greater amount of disability compensation. For the reasons set forth below, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-5\">The salient facts in this case are uncontested. Claimant was working for employer, a construction company, when he suffered a low back injury in 2007. Claimant returned to work on February 2, 2008, serving as an apprentice construction laborer. While claimant held that position, employer dispatched him to various construction-related jobs, and claimant\u2019s rate of pay depended on the type of project to which he was assigned. Specifically, the board found, claimant received $15.98 per hour when he worked on \u201cprivate contract\u201d jobs, but he received the \u201cprevailing pay rate of $33.70 per hour\u201d when he worked on projects involving \u201ca public works or other \u2018prevailing rate\u2019 type of jobf]\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In February and March 2008, claimant worked both on private contract jobs and on public works projects. As is relevant here, from March 11 through 19, claimant earned $33.70 per hour for his work on a U.S. Highway 97 re-routing job in Bend.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-6\">Claimant sustained a low back injury on March 19, 2008, when he was working on the Highway 97 job, and he filed a workers\u2019 compensation claim with employer\u2019s insurer, SAIF. Among other benefits, claimant sought temporary total disability compensation under ORS 656.210, which generally provides that such compensation will be based on the worker\u2019s \u201caverage weekly wage.\u201d ORS 656.210(1). To calculate claimant\u2019s average weekly wage and, therefore, the amount of temporary disability compensation payable for claimant\u2019s 2008 injury, SAIF averaged the wages that claimant had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"840\">*840</page-number>received for all of his work assignments from employer between February 2 and March 19, 2008, and paid him compensation based on that calculation.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b864-4\">At a hearing before an administrative law judge (ALJ), claimant argued that SAIF had incorrectly applied the provisions of OAR 436-060-0025(5), which governs the method of calculating the average weekly wage of workers who, like claimant, are \u201cregularly employed, but paid on other than a daily or weekly basis [.]\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The pertinent part of that rule provides that the calculation will be based on the terms of \u201cthe most recent wage earning agreement\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b864-5\">\u201c(a) For workers employed seasonally, on call, paid hourly, paid by piece work or with varying hours, shifts or wages:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b864-6\">\u00ed\u00ed\u00edf\u00ed \u00ed}\u00ed ij&lt;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b864-7\">\u201c[B](ii) Where there has been a change in the wage earning agreement due to a change of hours worked, change of job duties, or for other reasons either with or without a pay increase or decrease, during the 52 weeks prior to the date of injury, insurers must average earnings for the weeks worked under the most recent wage earning agreement, calculated by the method described in (5)(a)(A).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b864-8\">\u201c(in) For workers employed less than four weeks under a changed wage earning agreement as described in this subsection, insurers must use the intent of the most recent wage earning agreement as confirmed by the employer and the worker.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b864-9\">Claimant argued that, under OAR 436-060-0025(5)(a)(B), his average weekly wage should be calculated using only the rate of payment for his last work assignment, the Highway 97 job, which was $33.70 per hour. Claimant maintained that \u201ceach and every time that he was sent out to a job * * * there <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"841\">*841</page-number>was a change in the wage earning agreement.\u201d As we understand it, claimant\u2019s position was that his assignment to the Highway 97 job itself constituted his \u201cmost recent wage earning agreement.\u201d Given that the highway job lasted less than four weeks, claimant argued that OAR 436-060-0025 (5) (a)(B)(iii) \u2014 which references \u201cworkers employed less than four weeks under a changed wage earning agreement\u201d\u2014 applied to his claim for compensation and required SAIF to determine his temporary disability compensation based only on the time he worked on that project. In addition, claimant contended that he was entitled to a penalty and attorney fees because SAIF had impermissibly delayed payment of the full amount of the disability compensation that claimant alleged was due.</p>\n<p id=\"b865-4\">In response, SAIF asserted that the only \u201cchange\u201d in claimant\u2019s wage-earning agreement occurred when claimant returned to work in February 2008. Thus, SAIF impliedly took the position that the \u201cmost recent wage earning agreement\u201d between employer and claimant was their overarching agreement, formed in February 2008, which provided that employer would assign claimant to different construction projects at different rates of pay. Accordingly, SAIF argued, claimant\u2019s compensation properly was based on an average of his earnings from February and March. SAIF further asserted that claimant was not entitled to a penalty or attorney fees because there was \u201cno demonstration that the Claimant\u2019s time loss rate should be anything higher than what [it] paid.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b865-5\">The ALJ agreed with SAIF that the Highway 97 job assignment was not a \u201cchange\u201d in claimant\u2019s agreement to accept job assignments from employer:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b865-6\">\u201c[A]fter claimant returned to regular work following the 2007 injury, his wage earning agreement with the employer included the expectation that he would be dispatched to different construction projects as needed and that his work hours and pay rate would be determined by the type of project involved. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b865-7\">\u201cGiven [that] expectation * * *, I do not find that claimant\u2019s assignment to [the Highway 97 job] constituted a change in the wage earning agreement. Rather, it represented a continuation of the same wage earning agreement * * * \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b866-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"842\">*842</page-number>Accordingly, the ALJ concluded that SAIF had correctly calculated claimant\u2019s compensation by averaging his wages from February and March, and he denied claimant\u2019s request for increased compensation, as well as the associated request for a penalty and attorney fees. Claimant requested review of that decision before the board, which adopted and affirmed the ALJ\u2019s order.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Claimant then petitioned this court for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-4\">On judicial review, the parties largely reiterate the arguments they made below. For his part, claimant argues that the board erred (1) in determining that calculation of his earnings is governed by OAR 436-060-0025(5)(a)(B)(ii) rather than subsection (iii); and (2) in denying his request for a penalty and attorney fees under ORS 656.262(11)(a). SAIF responds (1) that substantial evidence supports the board\u2019s order; and (2) that the board\u2019s denial of claimant\u2019s request for a penalty and attorney fees was correct because SAIF \u201chad a reasonable doubt that claimant and his employer entered into a changed wage earning agreement when claimant was assigned to the US 97/Bend Project.\u201d We address claimant\u2019s arguments in turn, reviewing the board\u2019s order for legal error, as well as for substantial evidence and reason. ORS 183.482(8); <em>SAIF v. Ramos, </em>252 Or App 361, 363, 287 P3d 1220 (2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b866-5\">To determine whether the board erred in deciding that the Highway 97 job assignment did not \u201cchange\u201d the February 2008 agreement so as to replace that general employment agreement with a <em>new, </em>\u201cmost recent wage earning agreement,\u201d we first consider the board\u2019s findings about the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"843\">*843</page-number>February 2008 agreement, which the board adopted from the ALJ\u2019s order:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b867-4\">\u201c[Claimant\u2019s] wage earning agreement with the employer included the expectation that he would be dispatched to dif- \u25a0 ferent construction projects as needed and that his work hours and pay rate would be determined by the type of project involved. Claimant testified that he worked as an apprentice construction laborer and was dispatched to various construction projects. He testified that the number of hours he worked varied depending on the duration of the project and that his pay rate varied depending on whether the project was a private contract job, which paid a regular hourly rate of $15.98, or a public works or other \u2018prevailing rate\u2019 type job, which paid the prevailing hourly rate of $33.70. He testified that he did not negotiate his rate of pay for any project and was simply told what project he was being dispatched to and what the pay rate was for that project. ***\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b867-5\">Based on those findings, the board agreed with the AL J that, \u201c[g]iven the expectation [in the February 2008 agreement] that claimant would be dispatched to different projects and that his hours and pay rate would vary depending on the type of project involved,\u201d claimant\u2019s March 11 assignment to the Highway 97 project did not \u201cconstitute[] a change in the wage earning agreement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b867-6\">Claimant does not argue that the factual findings quoted above lack substantial evidentiary support in the record.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Nor do we understand claimant to be arguing that the board\u2019s order lacks substantial reason; that is, claimant does not contend that the board\u2019s conclusion does not logically follow from its factual findings. Rather, we view claimant\u2019s argument as raising purely legal questions: whether the board correctly interpreted OAR 436-060-0025(5) and applied the appropriate subsection of the rule in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-7\">Moreover, although claimant frames his argument primarily in terms of which subsection of OAR 436-060-0025(5)(a)(B) applies to his claim, the fundamental question is what constituted \u201cthe most recent wage earning agreement,\u201d for purposes of the rule, when claimant was injured <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"844\">*844</page-number>on March 19, 2008. No matter which subsection of the rule applies, the average weekly wage is based on \u201cthe most recent wage earning agreement,\u201d either calculated by averaging the earnings worked under that agreement (if OAR 436-060-0025(5)(a)(B)(ii) applies) or based on \u201cthe intent\u201d of that agreement (if subsection (iii) of the rule applies). Accordingly, we start by considering the meaning of \u201cthe most recent wage earning agreement\u201d as it is used in the administrative rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-4\">OAR 436-060-0025 contemplates that a \u201cwage earning agreement,\u201d whether oral or in writing, reflects the terms of an \u201cemployment relationship\u201d between a worker and an employer. OAR 436-060-0025(5)(a)(A). The rule specifically uses that phrase to refer to an agreement between an employer and a worker who is regularly employed but who is \u201cpaid on other than a daily or weekly basis\u201d or who is \u201cemployed with unscheduled, irregular or no earnings [.]\u201d OAR436-060-0025(5). The rule also describes circumstances that arise when the \u201cwage earning agreement\u201d has undergone a \u201cchange,\u201d and it explains how the average weekly wage must be calculated in each of those situations. OAR 436-060-0025(5)(a)(B)(i) - (iii). In both of the circumstances possibly implicated here, the result of any change is that the worker\u2019s average wage must be calculated according to \u201cthe most recent wage earning agreement.\u201d OAR 436-060-0025(5)(a)(B)(ii), (iii).</p>\n<p id=\"b868-5\">When considered together, those provisions establish that \u201cthe most recent wage earning agreement\u201d refers to the agreement that was in place when the claimant was injured. Moreover, the provisions contemplate that any pertinent \u201cchange\u201d to a wage earning agreement will have occurred before the injury. Thus, when the rule refers to a \u201cchange\u201d in the wage earning agreement, it describes a situation in which one wage earning agreement has been supplanted by a new wage earning agreement, <em>i.e., </em>\u201cthe most recent wage earning agreement\u201d in place at the time of injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-6\">Applying that understanding of the rule to this case, we must determine whether the board erred in determining that \u201cthe most recent wage earning agreement\u201d was the broad February 2008 understanding between claimant and employer, which had not \u201cchange [d] \u201d when employer assigned <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"845\">*845</page-number>claimant to the Highway 97 project. If that overarching understanding was the most recent wage earning agreement, then SAIF correctly determined claimant\u2019s average weekly wage by averaging his earnings on all jobs to which he was assigned in February and March 2008. As noted, claimant argues, in essence, that the wage earning agreement did \u201cchange\u201d \u2014 as a matter of law \u2014 when he was assigned to the Highway 97 project in March. Consequently, he contends, the most recent wage earning agreement must consist of the terms governing his work on that project, including the $33.70 hourly rate of pay.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-4\">We do not agree with claimant\u2019s narrow interpretation of the term \u201cwage earning agreement.\u201d Claimant\u2019s argument rests on the fact that, when he was assigned to the Highway 97 project, his work location changed, along with his hourly wage and the number of hours worked. It is true that some changes in hours worked, job duties, or the rate of pay may be the result of, or be reflected in, a new wage earning agreement entered into by a worker and his or her employer. But OAR 436-060-0025 does not specify that <em>every </em>change in the rate of pay or hours worked will result, as a matter of law, in a new \u201cwage earning agreement\u201d for purposes of the rule. If that were so, it would not make sense for the rule to go on \u2014 as it does \u2014 to provide for the averaging of weekly wages over a period of time. OAR 436-060-0025(5)(a)(B)(i), (ii). To the contrary, those provisions explicitly contemplate that a worker\u2019s earnings <em>will </em>fluctuate during the lifetime of a single wage earning agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-5\">Instead, we agree with the board that the \u201cwage earning agreement\u201d between a worker and his or her employer may be a general agreement reflecting the payment aspect of the parties\u2019 employment relationship, even if that agreement contemplates that the employee will be assigned to various jobs that will involve differing pay rates and hours. When such an overarching agreement exists, a new \u201cwage earning agreement\u201d is not formed each time an employee\u2019s job assignment results in the employee working additional (or fewer) hours or earning more (or less) money for each hour worked. Rather, the \u201cmost recent wage earning agreement\u201d is the most recent <em>general </em>agreement between the worker and employer, and it does not necessarily \u201cchange\u201d each time the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"846\">*846</page-number>employee is sent on a different job assignment.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Consequently, when a worker employed under such an agreement is injured, the worker\u2019s temporary disability compensation will be based on his or her average weekly earnings \u201cfor the weeks worked under [that] most recent wage earning agreement,\u201d OAR 436-060-0025(5)(a)(B)(ii), taking into account all of the jobs to which the worker has been assigned, with their associated hours and wage rates. The result is that the worker will be compensated based on an average rate that most closely approximates the average wage that the worker might have expected to earn in the future, had the injury not occurred, rather than the compensation either being unrepresentatively high (if the worker was injured on a prevailing wage rate job) or unrepresentatively low (if the worker was injured on a lower paying job), as it would be if the rule operated as claimant contends.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-4\">Nor are we persuaded by claimant\u2019s argument that ORS 656.210(2)(d)(A) requires us to interpret the rule so that a worker\u2019s \u201caverage weekly wage [is] calculated based on [the] wage he was earning at the job he was working on that caused his injury.\u201d The statutory provision on which claimant relies provides that benefits due an injured worker \u201cshall be based on the wage of the worker at the time of injury.\u201d ORS 656.210(2)(d)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b870-5\">We reject claimant\u2019s argument regarding the significance of that provision for two reasons. First, ORS 656.210(2)(d)(A) does not define \u201ctime of injury\u201d as the precise <em>moment </em>of injury, as claimant suggests. Rather, given that other subsections of the statute refer to the worker\u2019s weekly wage, the statutory reference to \u201cthe wage * * * at the time of injury\u201d necessarily refers to the worker\u2019s earnings during a period of time, not just in the moment.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Second, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"847\">*847</page-number>claimant reads the statutory provision out of context. That provision \u2014 ORS 656.210(2)(d) \u2014 follows an explanation of how the \u201cweekly wage\u201d is determined for a worker who is \u201cregularly employed\u201d in one job or who is employed in more than one job. The next subsection explains that for workers who are not regularly employed or whose remuneration, like claimant\u2019s, is \u201cnot based solely upon daily or weekly wages,\u201d the \u201cmethods for establishing the worker\u2019s weekly wage\u201d will be established by rule. ORS 656.210(2)(e). That is what OAR 436-060-0025 has accomplished, and we see nothing in the rule, as we have interpreted it, that conflicts with the broad legislative directive that temporary disability compensation be based on the worker\u2019s wage at the time of injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-4\">As applied here, the board found that claimant and employer entered into a wage earning agreement in February 2008 (which was a change from the agreement that had existed before claimant\u2019s injury the previous year) that included an \u201cexpectation that he would be dispatched to different construction projects as needed and that his work hours and pay rate would be determined by the type of project involved.\u201d Claimant has not challenged that finding, which is sufficient to support the board\u2019s determination that the February agreement was \u201cthe most recent wage earning agreement\u201d between claimant and employer. Moreover, as we have explained, neither ORS 656.210(2)(d)(A) nor OAR 436-060-0025 required the board to determine that the February 2008 wage earning agreement changed, and a new wage earning agreement was formed, when claimant was assigned to the Highway 97 project in March. Accordingly, the board did not err when it concluded that claimant\u2019s temporary disability compensation should be calculated based on his \u201caverage earnings for the weeks worked under\u201d the February 2008 agreement, as OAR 436-060-0025(5)(a)(B)(ii) requires. It follows that the board also did not err in rejecting claimant\u2019s claims for a penalty and attorney fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b863-7\"> The prevailing rate of $33.70 per hour consisted of an hourly wage of $23.15 plus hourly fringe-benefit pay of $10.55. In addition to the rates for private and public projects, claimant received a separate, lesser rate for driving and shop time.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b864-10\"> SAIF initially made a mistake in that calculation, resulting in an erroneously low average weekly wage, but it later corrected the error.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b864-11\"> That rule implements ORS 656.210(2)(e), which authorizes the director of the Department of Consumer and Business Services to adopt rules that \u201cprescribe methods for establishing the worker\u2019s weekly wage\u201d for workers \u201cwhose remuneration is not based solely upon daily or weekly wages.\u201d <em>See Tye v. McFetridge, </em>342 Or 61, 68, 149 P3d 1111 (2006) (a claimant who is \u201cpaid an hourly wage, based on the number of hours that he worked in a given week\u201d is not remunerated \u2018\u201cbased solely upon daily or weekly wages\u2019\u201d) (quoting ORS 656.210(2)(e)).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b866-6\"> One member of the board dissented, stating, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b866-7\">\u201cIn sum, subsection (ii) of the rule applies if the change in the wage earning agreement occurred when claimant returned to work after his injury in February 2008 * * *. Subsection (iii) applies if the change in the wage earning agreement occurred when he started working on the [Highway 97 job] where he was injured * * *.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b866-8\">\u201cBecause claimant\u2019s wages, hours, and work sites varied continually, the majority finds that these variations defined the wage earning agreement. Under my approach, each of claimant\u2019s jobs is the subject of a changed and more specific wage earning agreement. I submit that this approach is more consistent with the nature of claimant\u2019s work and therefore a more logical reading of the administrative rule.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b867-8\"> Although claimant mentions the substantial evidence standard of review in his briefs, he does not develop any argument based on that standard.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b870-6\"> Certainly an employee and worker <em>could </em>form a relationship in which they entered into a specific \u201cwage earning agreement\u201d each time the employer assigned the worker to a particular job site, or changed the worker\u2019s hours or pay rate in some other way. Our point is only that when an employer and worker are parties to a more general employment agreement that provides that the worker will be assigned to various jobs at various rates of pay, a new wage earning agreement does not spring into being \u2014 as a matter of law \u2014 each time the worker starts a different job assignment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b870-7\"> Of course, a single wage earning agreement \u2014 the most recent wage earning agreement \u2014 must remain in effect during the period of time over which wages are averaged.
