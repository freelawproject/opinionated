J.</author>\n<p id=\"b726-4\">In this consolidated appeal, defendant appeals from judgments convicting her in one case of felon in possession of a firearm and revoking her probation in another case based, in part, on the firearm conviction. The sole issue on appeal is whether the trial court erred in giving what is known as the \u201cwitness-false-in-part\u201d jury instruction. ORS 10.095(3); UCrJI 1029.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We review the trial court\u2019s decision whether to give the instruction for abuse of discretion, which, in this case, means that we review to determine whether the factual predicate to give the instruction was met. <em>Ireland v. Mitchell, </em>226 Or 286, 292, 359 P2d 894 (1961). As explained below, we conclude that the trial court erred in giving the instruction in this case and that the error was not harmless. Accordingly, we reverse and remand both judgments.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-5\">The pertinent facts are undisputed. Around midnight on January 8, 2010, Deputy Shaw and another officer responded to a report of a domestic disturbance. Defendant\u2019s mother, who had placed the 9-1-1 call, led the deputies to defendant\u2019s bedroom. Shaw listened at the door and could hear loud music and a man and woman arguing. He knocked on the door for about 10 minutes before defendant opened it and came out into the hall, wearing only a t-shirt and underwear. She closed the door immediately behind her.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-6\">Shaw asked defendant if her boyfriend, Brett, who Shaw knew was on probation, was in the room. Defendant denied that he was there. Saying that she needed to put on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"703\">*703</page-number>some clothes, she then stepped into a bathroom and closed the door. When she emerged a few minutes later, Shaw told her that he had heard her talking with a man in the bedroom, that he knew Brett was there, and that Brett needed to come out. Defendant again denied that Brett was there, saying that she had been talking to her dog. Defendant then quickly opened the bedroom door, saying, \u201cSee, he\u2019s not in here,\u201d and \u201che must have gone out the window.\u201d Shaw knew that no one had gone out the window, however, because he was aware that another officer had arrived on the scene and was watching the bedroom window from outside. Shaw looked into the room and spotted Brett, who was lying on the floor up against the bed. Shaw ordered Brett to stand and took him into custody on a probation violation detainer.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-4\">The officers brought Brett and defendant outside to their patrol cars. As they were placing Brett in one of the cars, the other deputy told Shaw that he had seen a \u201crifle round [lying] on the bed.\u201d When Shaw asked defendant about the rifle round and if there were any weapons in the house, she \u201cimmediately turned and started double timing it up back up to the house\u201d; the officers stopped her and placed her in handcuffs. Defendant denied any knowledge of weapons or ammunition in the room. Shaw went back into the bedroom and recovered a lever-action rifle lying on the floor near the bed and several rifle rounds. Defendant was charged with felon in possession of a firearm, ORS 166.270 (1), and violation of the general and special conditions of her probation, specifically \u201cfailing to remain a law-abiding citizen\u201d and \u201cfail[ing] to abstain from the use of intoxicants.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b727-5\">The felon-in-possession charge was tried to a jury. At trial, Shaw testified to the above-recounted facts. Defendant also testified. On direct examination, defendant related that she and Brett were in the bedroom \u201cjust kind of like yelling at each other over really loud music\u201d when the police came to the door. She admitted that she was on probation at the time of the offense, and, although a condition of her probation was that she not drink alcohol, she had had a relapse and was inebriated that night. When asked if she had been \u201ctrying to allow there to be some time for [Brett] to leave\u201d when she stepped out of the bedroom in response to the officer\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"704\">*704</page-number>knocking, she replied, \u201cNo.\u201d She also testified that she had not seen any bullets or a gun.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-4\">Then, on cross-examination, the following exchange took place:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b728-5\">\u201cQ. Okay. Why did you tell the officers that [Brett] wasn\u2019t in your room?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b728-6\">\u201cA. Because I \u2014 because I didn\u2019t want him to go to jail.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b728-7\">\u201cQ. Go to jail for what?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b728-8\">\u201cA. Drinking.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b728-9\">\u201cQ. And did it seem reasonable to you to say that it was the dog, that you were talking to the dog?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b728-10\">\u201cA. No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b728-11\">\u201cQ. And when you opened the door and said, \u2018See, there\u2019s no one there [,]\u2019 did you expect to see him hiding? Did you expect that he would have gone out the window? Why did you say that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b728-12\">\u201cA. I don\u2019t know, I just figured that \u2014 I didn\u2019t know there was a cop outside the window, I \u2014 you know? I just figured that they would be like, \u2018Okay. He\u2019s not there [,] \u2019 and then leave, I guess is what I was thinking.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b728-13\">\u201cQ. So, you figured enough time had passed that he would have gone out the window?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b728-14\">\u201cA. No, I \u2014 no, I knew he didn\u2019t go out the window.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b728-15\">\u201cQ. So, then you knew he would be hiding?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b728-16\">\u201cA. Yeah.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b728-17\">The state asked the court to give the witness-false-in-part jury instruction. Defense counsel objected, asserting that the instruction typically applied to \u201clies witnesses are\u2014 are caught in on the stand\u201d and that was not the case here. The prosecutor agreed with that proposition \u2014 that is, that the instruction applied only to statements \u201con the stand\u201d\u2014 but continued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b728-18\">\u201cBut, the incident to which I\u2019m referring is the confusion and the misstatements regarding whether he had gone out the window, no he was hiding and there was inconsistencies which I think are partial lies that happened there. You <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"705\">*705</page-number>know, \u2018Did you give him an opportunity to go out the window?\u2019 \u2018No, I wasn\u2019t.\u2019 But then she opens the door and says, \u2018See there\u2019s no one there [,]\u2019 thereby implying that he would have had an opportunity to go out of the window.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b729-4\">\u201cAnd then she changed it to, \u2018Well, no, I didn\u2019t think he\u2019d gone out the window, then I must have thought he was hiding.\u2019 And I think that string of question and answers is sufficient to support a witness false in part.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b729-5\">Defense counsel disagreed that there was any \u201cclear contradiction that you could call a falsehood in [defendant\u2019s] testimony today\u201d and that what the prosecutor \u201cis talking about is a contradiction between on-stand testimony and things that were said before.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b729-6\">The trial court reasoned that, although the instruction refers to \u201ctestimony,\u201d the explanatory comment to the instruction indicated \u201cthat it wouldn\u2019t be an abuse of discretion to give that instruction when there was a major inconsistency between [defendant\u2019s] testimony and her prior statements.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Accordingly, over defendant\u2019s objection, the court gave the witness-false-in-part jury instruction, and the jury found defendant guilty of the felon-in-possession charge. Based on that jury finding, and defendant\u2019s admission that she had violated the conditions of her probation in consuming alcohol that night, the court also revoked defendant\u2019s probation.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-7\">On appeal, defendant argues that, contrary to the state\u2019s theory at trial, \u201c[n]o part of [defendant\u2019s] testimony on cross-examination contradicted any part of her testimony on direct nor was it internally inconsistent.\u201d Moreover, defendant contends, the trial court\u2019s reasoning for giving the instruction was flawed because inconsistencies between defendant\u2019s trial testimony and her statements to the police at the scene do not demonstrate that she \u201c\u2018consciously <em>testified </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"706\">*706</page-number>falsely.\u2019\u201d (Quoting <em>Ireland, </em>226 Or at 293 (emphasis defendant\u2019s)). Instead, according to defendant, she candidly testified at trial that her <em>earlier statements </em>to the police were false \u2014 that is, that she had lied to the police in order to protect her boyfriend \u2014 and, therefore, the court abused its discretion in giving the instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-4\">The state responds that the instruction was justified based on either theory \u2014 that is, based on internal inconsistencies in defendant\u2019s trial testimony or because her trial testimony was inconsistent with her statements to the police at the scene. Regarding the latter, the state contends that the case law does not support defendant\u2019s asserted distinction \u201cthat only instances of perjury at trial authorize giving the witness-false-in-part instruction.\u201d The state also suggests that, in any event, any error in giving the instruction was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-5\">As explained below, we agree with defendant. We also conclude that the error was not harmless. Therefore, we reverse and remand defendant\u2019s judgment of conviction for felon in possession of a firearm, as well as the resulting judgment of probation violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-6\">The statutory instructions set forth in ORS 10.095 are to be given \u201con all proper occasions.\u201d A \u201cproper occasion\u201d for giving the instruction stated in ORS 10.095(3) \u2014 \u201c[t]hat a witness false in one part of the testimony of the witness is to be distrusted in others\u201d \u2014 is when there is sufficient evidence from which the jury could decide \u201cthat at least one witness consciously <em>testified </em>falsely.\u201d <em>Ireland, </em>226 Or at 293 (emphasis added).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> There must be evidence \u201cthat a witness was willfully false, not just mistaken, confused or hazy in recollection.\u201d <em>State v. Long, </em>106 Or App 389, 395, 807 P2d 815, <em>adh\u2019d to as modified on recons, </em>107 Or App 284, 812 P2d 831 (1991), <em>overruled on other grounds by City of Portland v. Jackson, </em>111 Or App 233, 826 P2d 37 (1992), <em>rev\u2019d, </em>316 Or 143, 850 P2d 1093 (1993) (internal quotation marks omitted). Thus, if there is a basis in the record for determining that defendant willfully lied in her testimony, the court did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"707\">*707</page-number>abuse its discretion in giving the instruction. We turn to that question.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-4\">We begin with the reasoning on which the trial court apparently relied \u2014 that the instruction was proper due to inconsistencies between defendant\u2019s trial testimony and her statements to the police at the scene. As an initial matter, we agree with the trial court (and the state) that, as a general matter, a witness\u2019s unsworn statements that contradict the witness\u2019s testimony <em>can </em>provide the basis for giving the instruction; in other words, it need not be shown that the witness was inconsistent <em>within </em>the witness\u2019s trial testimony itself \u2014 as defense counsel put it at trial, that the witness be \u201ccaught\u201d in a lie on the stand.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-5\">Three cases inform our conclusion in that regard. First, in <em>Ireland, </em>the question was whether the trial court had erred in not giving the witness-false-in-part instruction when there were minor inconsistencies between defendant\u2019s trial testimony and his deposition two years earlier. 226 Or at 289. The Supreme Court held that it was within the court\u2019s discretion to decline to give the instruction, because, while the instruction <em>could </em>properly have been given (that is, \u201c[t]he jury could have found that the defendant\u2019s testimony did not ring true,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 294), \u201cnone [of the inconsistencies] gave enough indication of intentional deceit to require the instruction as a matter of law.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 295. As the court observed, \u201cthe most obvious case\u201d of the latter is when \u201ca witness has manifestly perjured himself.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 292.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-6\">Next, in <em>Long, </em>the trial court gave the instruction over the defendant\u2019s objection. The only possible basis for the instruction was a conflict between the defendant\u2019s and another witness\u2019s testimony at trial. 106 Or App at 395. We held that, although it was not \u201cconclusive as to [the] falsity\u201d of the defendant\u2019s testimony, the inconsistency <em>could </em>indicate that defendant was willfully false in his testimony and, therefore, the court did not abuse its discretion in giving the requested instruction. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b731-7\">Finally, in <em>State v. Weaver, </em>139 Or App 207, 211, 911 P2d 969, <em>rev den, </em>323 Or 483 (1996), the defendant argued that the trial court had abused its discretion in declining <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"708\">*708</page-number>to give the instruction based on \u201ca number of minor inconsistencies between the victim\u2019s testimony at trial and what she had previously recounted to authorities about defendant\u2019s alleged sexual acts.\u201d We affirmed the trial court\u2019s apparent conclusion that the discrepancies were not \u201cmaterial enough\u201d to require the requested instruction, <em>id,.; </em>implicit in that decision was our recognition that a contradictory statement that is not part of the witness\u2019s trial testimony or an otherwise sworn statement <em>could </em>support a witness-false-in-part instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-4\">Those cases instruct that inconsistencies between a witness\u2019s trial testimony and (1) his or her deposition testimony, (2) another witness\u2019s trial testimony, or (3) the witness\u2019s prior, unsworn statements to investigating officials <em>can </em>support the giving of a witness-false-in-part instruction <em>if the </em>jury could find from those inconsistencies that the witness willfully testified falsely. The mere fact that the testimony of a witness is contradicted, however, is not <em>conclusive </em>as to its falsity. <em>Long, </em>106 Or App at 395.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-5\">Thus, we agree with the trial court that inconsistencies between a defendant\u2019s trial testimony and the defendant\u2019s earlier statements to the police can provide evidence that the defendant has willfully testified falsely and, thus, support the giving of the instruction. However, that is not the case here. Although defendant told the police something different about her behavior the night of the offense than she testified to at trial, in her trial testimony, she admitted that she had lied to the police earlier. In response to questions on cross-examination, defendant explained that she had lied about Brett being in the bedroom because she did not want him to get into trouble for drinking in violation of his probation. Thus, the identified inconsistency does not tend to show that there was anything about defendant\u2019s <em>testimony </em>that was false \u2014 let alone consciously false \u2014 when measured against her earlier statements. Instead, defendant\u2019s testimony in this case demonstrates quite clearly that her prior statements were false, not that her testimony was false. In other words, there is nothing about defendant\u2019s statements to the police that contradicts her testimony at trial <em>that she had lied in making those statements. </em>In short, defendant\u2019s statements at the scene do not provide a basis from which the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"709\">*709</page-number>jury could find that defendant consciously <em>testified </em>falsely, and the court abused its discretion in giving the instruction on that basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-4\">We turn to the alternative reasoning advanced by the state \u2014 that inconsistencies <em>within </em>defendant\u2019s trial testimony justified the court\u2019s decision to give the instruction. <em>See Outdoor Media Dimensions Inc. v. State of Oregon, </em>331 Or 634, 659-60 20 P3d 180 (2001) (describing \u201cright for the wrong reason\u201d principle, which permits an appellate court to affirm a correct decision of the trial court on a basis other than one on which the trial court relied if certain predicate conditions are satisfied). The state contends that defendant \u201cgave contradictory testimony about whether she knew or expected [Brett] to be hiding as a result of her delay tactics,\u201d and that that inconsistency was sufficient to support giving the instruction. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-5\">The state points out that defendant testified, \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d when asked whether, when she let the officers see into the bedroom, she expected to see Brett hiding or expected that he would have gone out the window, then later said she \u201cknew [Brett] didn\u2019t go out the window,\u201d and agreed that she \u201cknew he would be hiding.\u201d We disagree that that constitutes evidence from which a jury could find that defendant \u201cconsciously testified falsely.\u201d <em>Ireland, </em>226 Or at 293.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-6\">Defendant\u2019s testimony was not internally inconsistent. Her statement, \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d was in response to a compound query that posed three questions, two of which were contradictory. That exchange proceeded as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b733-7\">\u201cQ. And when you opened the door and said, \u2018See, there\u2019s no one there [,]\u2019 did you expect to see him hiding? Did you expect that he would have gone out the window? Why did you say that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b733-8\">\u201cA. I don\u2019t know, I just figured that \u2014 I didn\u2019t know there was a cop outside the window, I \u2014 you know? I just figured that they would be like, \u2018Okay. He\u2019s not there [,] \u2019 and then leave, I guess is what I was thinking.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b733-9\">\u201cQ. So, you figured enough time had passed that he would have gone out the window?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b733-10\">\u201cA. No, I \u2014 no, I knew he didn\u2019t go out the window.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b734-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"710\">*710</page-number>\u201cQ. So, then you knew he would be hiding?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b734-4\">\u201cA. Yeah.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b734-5\">Thus, defendant\u2019s testimony that she \u201cd[i]dn\u2019t know\u201d reflects that she had not thought about what she expected Brett to have done; she hoped only that the officers would not see him. Her subsequent response indicating that she did not think enough time had passed for Brett to have gone out the window and therefore she \u201cknew\u201d that he was hiding does not contradict her testimony that she had not thought about what she expected when she opened the door. Accordingly, we decline to affirm the trial court\u2019s ruling on the alternative basis advanced by the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-6\">We also must consider whether the trial court\u2019s error in giving the instruction was harmless. Article VII (Amended), section 3, of the Oregon Constitution requires us to affirm the trial court\u2019s judgment even if error was committed, if that error was harmless. <em>State v. Affeld, </em>307 Or 125, 128, 764 P2d 220 (1988). \u201cOregon\u2019s constitutional test for affirmance despite error consists of a single inquiry: Is there little likelihood that the particular error affected the verdict?\u201d <em>State v. Davis, </em>336 Or 19, 32, 77 P3d 1111 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b734-7\">The state suggests that the error here was harmless because, given defendant\u2019s admission at trial that she had lied to the police at the scene, the jury \u201cundoubtedly was on notice that defendant\u2019s credibility was suspect,\u201d even without the instruction. Moreover, the state contends, the uncontested evidence shows that the rifle that formed the basis for the felon-in-possession charge was in plain view in the bedroom \u2014 thus, defendant\u2019s testimony that she was unaware of it was \u201cpatently unbelievable.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b734-8\">We disagree. The erroneously given instruction bears on the credit to be given to defendant\u2019s testimony <em>under oath, </em>which is qualitatively different from whether she was prepared to lie to the police at the scene. The credibility of that testimony was essential to defendant\u2019s success at trial: her theory was that the gun belonged to Brett, that she had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"711\">*711</page-number>not seen it before, and that he had brought it into her bedroom without her knowledge. Moreover, as defendant points out, the error in this case was particularly prejudicial because the prosecutor specifically connected the instruction with defendant and used it in closing argument. In his closing rebuttal argument, the prosecutor stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b735-4\">\u201cI want you to assume that the defendant was lying on that stand. And there\u2019s going to be a jury instruction that you\u2019re going to get that talks about that and it\u2019s called \u2018witness false in part.\u2019 And what it says is \u2018A witness who lies in one part of his or her testimony is likely to lie in other parts of [the witness\u2019s] testimony and you may distrust [the witness\u2019s] entire testimony.\u2019\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b735-5\">Given those circumstances, we cannot say that the court\u2019s error in giving the instruction was unlikely to have affected the jury\u2019s verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-6\">Finally, as noted, defendant\u2019s conviction for felon in possession of a firearm also formed the basis, in part, for the court\u2019s revocation of defendant\u2019s probation.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In sentencing defendant for the probation violations, the court did not indicate whether it would have revoked defendant\u2019s probation or imposed the same sentence in the absence of that conviction. We therefore also reverse the probation revocation judgment and remand to the trial court for reconsideration in light of the reversal of defendant\u2019s conviction. <em>See State v. McMilian, </em>191 Or App 62, 69, 80 P3d 538 (2003), <em>rev den, </em>337 Or 248 (2004) (reversing and remanding judgment of probation violation for trial court to reconsider revocation decision based, in part, on convictions that were reversed on appeal, citing <em>State v.
