We reject defendant\u2019s first assignment of error without discussion. With regard to the second, the state concedes that the trial court plainly erred in entering the finding of contempt as a misdemeanor conviction. We agree and accept the state\u2019s concession; moreover, considering the interests of the parties and the ends of justice in this case, we conclude that it is appropriate to exercise our discretion to correct the error. <em>See State v. Quade, </em>252 Or App 577, 287 P3d 1278 (2012) (correcting as plain error the trial court\u2019s entry of misdemeanor convictions for contempt); <em>State v. Caldwell, </em>247 Or App 372, 375 n 1, 270 P3d 341 (2011) (\u201cA conviction for contempt is not a proper disposition.\u201d); <em>State v. Reynolds, </em>239 Or App 313, 316, 243 P3d 496 (2010) (accepting state\u2019s concession that contempt is not a crime and that the court erred in entering a conviction for contempt).</p>\n<p id=\"b497-5\">Conviction on Count 4 reversed and remanded with instructions to enter a judgment finding defendant in contempt of court; otherwise affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
