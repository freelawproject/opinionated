We reject two of his three assignments of error without discussion and write only to address his third assignment of error. In that assignment, defendant contends that the trial court \u201cerred in ordering a lifetime suspension of [his] driving privileges\u201d under ORS 809.235, which provides for permanent revocation of a person\u2019s driving privileges when, among other things, the person is convicted for a third time of DUII \u201cin violation of*** ORS 813.010\u201d or the \u201cstatutory counterpart to ORS 813.010 in another jurisdiction.\u201d In particular, defendant asserts that the trial court erred in counting as a predicate conviction, for purposes of the lifetime revocation, his conviction for DUII under <em>former </em>ORS 487.540 (1975), <em>repealed </em>by Or Laws 1983, ch 338, \u00a7 978, at a time when the offense was classified as an infraction. We conclude that the trial court properly ordered a lifetime revocation of defendant\u2019s driving privileges and, accordingly, affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-5\">The few relevant facts are undisputed. Defendant was arrested after he walked into a convenience store noticeably intoxicated. A store clerk called law enforcement and reported that defendant had driven to the store and was still there, and that the clerk believed defendant to be intoxicated. After he was arrested, defendant was ultimately charged with and, following a stipulated facts trial, convicted of, DUII.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> At sentencing, the state argued, over defendant\u2019s objection, that, based on \u201cviolation convictions in 1978 [and] 1976 for DUII,\u201d as well as a 1998 conviction, defendant was subject to a lifetime revocation of his driving privileges pursuant to ORS 809.235.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The court disregarded the 1978 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>DUII, which was a bail forfeiture. However, based on the remaining convictions, the court ordered a lifetime revocation of defendant\u2019s driving privileges.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-4\">On appeal, defendant asserts that \u201cORS 809.235 requires a lifetime suspension of [a] defendant\u2019s driver\u2019s license when the defendant is convicted of DUII and he has two or more prior convictions for violating ORS 813.010. In the present case, there was only one qualifying prior conviction.\u201d In defendant\u2019s view, the trial court could not properly count an infraction DUII conviction under <em>former </em>ORS 487.540 as a predicate offense to support the lifetime revocation of his driving privileges. The state responds that, in light of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>State v. Kellar, </em>349 Or 626, 247 P3d 1232 (2011), and the history of ORS 809.235, defendant\u2019s conviction under the prior version of the DUII statute qualifies as a predicate offense for purposes of a lifetime revocation under ORS 809.235. We agree with the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-5\">We begin by summarizing some of the history of Oregon\u2019s DUII statutes. In 1975, the legislature sought to decriminalize the offense of DUII and, to that end, classified DUII under <em>former </em>ORS 487.540 as a traffic infraction rather than a crime.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>Kellar, </em>349 Or at 629. Then, in 1981, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>the legislature classified DUII pursuant to <em>former </em>ORS 487.540 as a misdemeanor.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>\u201cIn 1983, the legislature undertook a comprehensive revision of the vehicle code.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 630 (citing Or Laws 1983, ch 338). At that time, the legislature explained that the intent behind those revisions was not to change the law but, rather, to simplify the code. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b626-4\">\u201cAs part of the revision of the vehicle code, the 1983 legislature repealed the prohibition against DUII found in <em>former </em>ORS 487.540, and reenacted the same prohibition, which was later codified as ORS 813.010. <em>See </em>Or Laws 1983, ch 338, \u00a7 978 (repealing <em>former </em>ORS 487.540); <em>id. </em>\u00a7 587 (reenacting the same prohibition). There is no substantive difference between the 1981 prohibition against DUII found in <em>former </em>ORS 487.540 and the prohibition against DUII enacted as part of the 1983 vehicle code revision. <em>Compare former </em>ORS 487.540 (1) and (2) (1981), <em>with </em>Or Laws 1983, ch 338, \u00a7 587. Not only are the elements of those two prohibitions identical, but both prohibitions made DUII a Class A misdemeanor. <em>Id. </em>And, as noted, the legislature provided that the 1983 DUII prohibition it enacted was a continuation of the 1981 prohibition it repealed.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b626-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 631 (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b627-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>In view of that history, the Supreme Court considered in <em>Kellar </em>the question \u201cwhether a conviction for DUII in violation of <em>former </em>ORS 487.540 can serve as a predicate conviction for the permanent revocation of a person\u2019s driver\u2019s license.\u201d 349 Or at 628. It examined the text and context of ORS 809.235(1)(b)(A)(i) to resolve that issue:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-4\">\u201cSubparagraph (i) refers to convictions for DUII in violation of \u2018ORS 813.010.\u2019 It does not refer to DUII convictions in violation of ORS 813.010 and its statutory predecessor. It is thus possible to infer, as defendant does, that the legislature intended to limit in-state predicate convictions to those convictions entered after January 1, 1986 \u2014 the effective date of the 1983 act that revised and recodified the vehicle code. As this court has explained, however, a statute\u2019s \u2018text should not be read in isolation but must be considered in context.\u2019 <em>Stevens v. Czerniak, </em>336 Or 392, 401, 84 P3d 140 (2004); <em>see State v. Barrett, </em>331 Or 27, 32, 10 P3d 901 (2000) (same). In this case, the statutory context cuts against defendant\u2019s interpretation ***.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b627-7\"><em>Kellar, </em>349 Or at 634.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-8\">The court observed that the context demonstrates that \u201cthe legislature intended the revised vehicle code to be a seamless continuation of the provisions that preceded them.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Indeed, the legislature \u201cspecified that ORS 813.010 was a continuation of <em>former </em>ORS 487.540,\u201d and, accordingly, \u201cthe reference to ORS 813.010 in ORS 809.235\u201d would be a slim basis on which to disregard that intent. <em>Id. </em>at 635. In addition, \u201can out-of-state DUII conviction may serve as a predicate conviction for the permanent revocation of a person\u2019s driver\u2019s license, without regard to when the out-of-state conviction occurred.\u201d <em>Id. </em>That lack of time limitation for out-of-state convictions, the court concluded, weighed against imposing such a limitation for in-state convictions. The court also observed that changes to ORS 809.235 over time indicated \u201cthat the reference to convictions \u2018in violation of ORS 813.010\u2019 includes convictions in violation of both the named statute and its identically worded predecessor.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 636 (footnote omitted). Accordingly, the court concluded that, in view of the \u201ctext and context of ORS 809.235 [,] *** a misdemeanor DUII conviction in violation of <em>former </em>ORS <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>487.540 counts as a predicate conviction for the purposes of permanent revocation of a person\u2019s driver\u2019s license.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 637.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-5\">The court in <em>Kellar </em>specifically declined to consider \u201cwhether a conviction for an infraction DUII in violation of <em>former </em>ORS 487.540 can serve as a predicate conviction for the purposes of ORS 809.235.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 637 n 10. That is the question that we must resolve in this case and, for reasons similar to those relied on by the court in <em>Kellar, </em>we answer that question in the affirmative.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-6\">First, we observe that the legislative intent underlying ORS 809.235 is to cover an expansive range of conduct. That is illustrated by the evolution of that statute, as set forth in Kellar:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b628-7\">\u201cInitially, ORS 809.235 required permanent revocation of a person\u2019s driver\u2019s license only when that person had been convicted of using a motor vehicle to commit murder or manslaughter. Or Laws 1993, ch 761, \u00a7 2. In 2001, the legislature provided that the class of persons whose licenses were subject to permanent revocation also included persons convicted of felony DUII. Or Laws 2001, ch 786, \u00a7 1. Two years earlier, the legislature had provided that a person was guilty of felony DUII if the person \u2018has been convicted of driving while under the influence of intoxicants in violation of this section [ORS 813.010] or its statutory counterpart in another jurisdiction at least three times in the 10 years prior to the date of the current offense * * *.\u2019 Or Laws 1999, ch 1049, \u00a7 1.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b628-8\">\u201cIn 2003, the legislature amended ORS 809.235 to require permanent revocation of a person\u2019s driver\u2019s license \u2018if the person is convicted of misdemeanor driving while under the influence of intoxicants under ORS 813.010 for a third time.\u2019 Or Laws 2003, ch 346, \u00a7 2. The 2003 amendment effectively reduced the number of DUII convictions required for a permanent revocation from four (for felony DUII) to three. It also contained no time limitation, unlike felony DUII which required that the three prior DUII convictions have occurred within 10 years of the fourth DUII. The 2003 amendment to ORS 809.235, however, limited the class of convictions that would result in permanent revocation to misdemeanor convictions in violation of ORS 813.010. In that respect, it was narrower than the felony DUII <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>statute, which included prior DUII convictions in violation of ORS 813.010 <em>and </em>its statutory counterparts in other jurisdictions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b629-4\">\u201cThe legislature removed that latter limitation, in part, in 2005 by amending ORS 809.235 to require permanent revocation of a person\u2019s driver\u2019s license \u2018if the person is convicted of misdemeanor driving while under the influence of intoxicants in violation of ORS 813.010 or its statutory counterpart in any other jurisdiction for a third or subsequent time.\u2019 <em>See </em>ORS 809.235(1)(b) (2005) (codifying Or Laws 2005, ch 436, \u00a7 1).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b629-5\">349 Or at 631-32 (brackets, omission, and emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b629-6\">In 2007, \u201cthe legislature expanded ORS 809.235 yet again.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 632. First, it \u201comitted the term \u2018misdemeanor,\u2019 found in the 2003 and 2005 versions of ORS 809.235, as a limitation on the DUII convictions that can serve as predicate convictions for the purposes of ORS 809.235.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 633. In addition, it \u201cexpanded the category of DUII offenses from other jurisdictions that will result in the permanent revocation of a person\u2019s driver\u2019s license to include acts that violate that jurisdiction\u2019s DUII laws but that might not be criminal in Oregon.\u201d <em>Id. </em>That expansive intent weighs against defendant\u2019s position.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-8\">Furthermore, as discussed in <em>Kellar, </em>the revised vehicle code provisions were intended \u201cto be a seamless continuation of the provisions that preceded them,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 634, and a conviction under <em>former </em>ORS 487.540 serves as a predicate conviction for purposes of ORS 809.235. The statute does not contain any express limitation stating that, to be a basis for permanent revocation of a person\u2019s driving privileges, convictions must be for misdemeanor DUII. As noted, in 2007, the legislature specifically removed the requirement of ORS 809.235 that a predicate conviction must be for a misdemeanor. When it deleted the term \u201cmisdemeanor\u201d from ORS 809.235, the legislature instead provided that predicate convictions included \u201cany of the following <em>offenses </em>in any combination.\u201d Or Laws 2007, ch 879, \u00a7 4 (emphasis added). The use of the term \u201coffenses\u201d is \u201csignificant, as the legislature has defined \u2018offense\u2019 to include <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>violations.\u201d <em>State v. Donovan, </em>243 Or App 187, 198, 256 P3d 196 (2011) (citing ORS 161.505 (defining\u2018offense\u2019 as a crime or a violation)). In our view, the legislature\u2019s deletion of the term \u201cmisdemeanor\u201d from ORS 809.235 was a continuation of its expansion of the coverage of that statute and is indicative of a legislative intent for in-state infraction DUII convictions to serve as predicates for the permanent revocation of a person\u2019s driving privileges.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-4\">Finally, out-of-state convictions for infraction DUII are considered the \u201cstatutory counterpart\u201d to a conviction pursuant to ORS 813.010. <em>See Donovan, </em>243 Or at 198 (a New York traffic infraction DUII is a statutory counterpart to ORS 813.010). Here, as in <em>Kellar, </em>\u201cwithout some apparent basis for giving greater effect to out-of-state DUII convictions than in-state DUII convictions, that context counsels against reading the reference to convictions in violation of ORS 813.010 as narrowly as defendant would.\u201d <em>Kellar, </em>349 Or at 635.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-5\">In view of the foregoing, we are convinced that, contrary to defendant\u2019s assertion, a conviction for an infraction DUII under <em>former </em>ORS 487.540 counts as a predicate offense for permanent revocation of a person\u2019s driving privileges pursuant to ORS 809.235. Accordingly, the trial court in this case did not err in this case when it ordered the permanent revocation of defendant\u2019s driving privileges.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b624-6\"> As noted, defendant was also charged with and convicted of interfering with a peace officer.
