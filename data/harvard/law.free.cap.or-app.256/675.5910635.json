We reject defendant\u2019s second and third assignments of error without discussion. In his first assignment of error, defendant argues that the trial court erred by refusing to give a special jury instruction that would have informed the jurors that possession of less than an ounce of dried marijuana leaves, stems, and flowers is a violation, not a crime. Defendant contends that he was entitled to the special instruction because it would have supported a theory that, in fact, he possessed only dried marijuana, and not hashish. We reject that argument because it is not properly preserved for our review. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-5\">Because defendant\u2019s argument relates to the trial court\u2019s rejection of his requested jury instruction, \u201cwe view the facts in the light most favorable to defendant.\u201d <em>State v. Wan, </em>251 Or App 74, 80, 281 P3d 662 (2012). We describe the facts according to that standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-6\">A state trooper who was patrolling trails around a lake observed defendant smoking from a multicolored glass pipe and smelled the odor of burnt marijuana. The trooper asked defendant whether he had a medical marijuana card, and defendant responded that he did not have a card, but needed to get one. The trooper seized defendant\u2019s pipe and saw that it contained \u201csome material,\u201d which he described at trial as \u201cburned on top and * * * resinous, almost tarball-ish looking.\u201d The trooper initially cited defendant for possession of less than one ounce of marijuana, as he had not then formed a belief that the substance in the pipe was hashish, rather than dried marijuana.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The trooper then \u201cbroke contact\u201d with defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-7\">Later, after preliminary testing indicated that the substance likely was hashish, the trooper called defendant and \u201ctold him to disregard the citation\u201d because the trooper \u201cwas going to send * * * the pipe in for testing for hashish, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"677\">*677</page-number>which would be a different charge if that was * * * positive.\u201d Defendant told the trooper that he had not known that the substance was hashish and asserted \u201cthat it was not his pipe.\u201d The trooper sent the pipe and the material it contained to the forensic laboratory of the Oregon State Police. Testing there also indicated that the \u201cchunk\u201d of material from the pipe was 0.38 grams of cannabis resin, <em>i.e., </em>hashish.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-4\">An amended indictment charged defendant with unlawful possession of cannabis resin in violation of ORS 475.840(3) (2009), which generally made it \u201cunlawful for any person <em>knowingly or intentionally </em>to possess a controlled substance unless the substance was obtained directly from, or pursuant to, a valid prescription or [in other circumstances not applicable here].\u201d (Emphasis added.) As pertinent to defendant\u2019s arguments, Oregon law also then provided that, notwithstanding the statute classifying unlawful possession of marijuana as a Class B felony, such possession was only a <em>violation </em>\u2014 i.e., not a crime \u2014 \u201cif the amount possessed [was] less than one avoirdupois ounce of the dried leaves, stems and flowers of the plant Cannabis family Moraceae.\u201d ORS 475.864(3) (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b701-5\">Before trial, defendant requested a special jury instruction that would have informed the jurors that possession of less than one ounce of dried marijuana is not a crime. Defendant\u2019s requested instruction stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b701-6\">\u201cUnlawful possession of marijuana is a violation, not a crime, if the amount possessed is less than one avoirdupois ounce of the dried leaves, stems and flowers of the plant Cannabis family Moraceae.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b701-7\">Defendant argued in the trial court that he was entitled to that special instruction because a jury could determine, based on evidence in the record, that defendant had believed that he possessed only dried marijuana leaves, stems, and flowers and, therefore, did not believe that he was committing a crime. Defendant began by explaining to the court that he was \u201cshooting for *** the knowledge requirement\u201d \u2014 an apparent reference to the <em>mens rea </em>requirement in ORS 475.840(3) (2009) \u2014 arguing that \u201cthere [was] going to be evidence that [defendant] thought it was just marijuana.\u201d The prosecutor responded, \u201cThat\u2019s not the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"678\">*678</page-number>law[,]\u201d a view that the trial court echoed. Citing <em>State v. Engen, </em>164 Or App 591, 993 P2d 161 (1999), <em>rev den, </em>330 Or 331 (2000), defendant acknowledged that, \u201cif you say, *** \u2018Oh, it \u2014 I thought it was cocaine and it\u2019s really meth,\u2019 that\u2019s not a defense.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Defendant argued, however, that the facts of this case differed because \u201cwhat [defendant] thought it was a \u2014 not a crime.\u201d Later in the discussion, defendant again explained that his theory related to \u201cknowledge \u2014 as far as the specific controlled substance.\u201d Defendant argued that the general <em>rule </em>\u2014 i.e., that a defendant need not have known the exact nature of the controlled substance that he was charged with illegally possessing \u2014 did not apply where, as defendant asserted was true in this case, the defendant believed that he possessed only a substance (less than an ounce of dried marijuana) that \u201cwouldn\u2019t be a crime\u201d to possess. Defendant concluded,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b702-4\">\u201cSo, that whole thing is \u2014 he thought it was just regular old marijuana. And, if that\u2019s the case \u2014 if\u2014if he were correct, and that was less than an ounce, it wouldn\u2019t be a crime. And so, therefore, <em>it goes to his knowledge of what it was.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b702-5\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b702-6\">In response, the prosecutor argued that whether defendant had committed a crime had \u201cnothing to do with whether [defendant] * * * knew what type of marijuana it was.\u201d After researching the issue during a break, the trial court ruled in the state\u2019s favor:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b702-7\">\u201cI read that <em>[Engen] </em>case over and over again, and I actually did some independent research. I couldn\u2019t find anything that supports what you are saying.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b702-8\">\u201cIt seems to me like the elements are pretty straight forward, \u2018knowingly possesses a controlled substance.\u2019 Obviously, he doesn\u2019t have to know what the controlled substance is.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b702-9\">Accordingly, the court declined to give defendant\u2019s requested instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"679\">*679</page-number>Defendant\u2019s case was tried to a jury, and the state trooper, who had arrested defendant, testified as described earlier in this opinion. Defendant also testified, admitting that he had been smoking from a pipe before the trooper approached him. Defendant asserted that he thought he had been smoking \u201cweed, or marijuana.\u201d The jury convicted defendant, who appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-4\">Before this court, defendant challenges the trial court\u2019s refusal to give his requested special jury instruction. He no longer argues, however, as he did below, that he was entitled to the requested instruction because it was relevant to his theory that he could not be convicted if he <em>believed </em>that he possessed only a substance (less than an ounce of dried marijuana) that is not a crime, under Oregon law, to possess. As detailed above, that theory related to the <em>mens rea </em>element of ORS 475.840(3) (2009), which provided that, with some exceptions, it was a crime to \u201cknowingly or intentionally\u201d possess a controlled substance.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-5\">Instead of arguing that he was entitled to the jury instruction because it was relevant to the <em>mens rea </em>requirement, defendant now contends that he was entitled to the instruction because it supported a theory \u201cthat the substance [he possessed] <em>was indeed </em>* * * the dried stems, leaves and flowers ofthe cannabis plant.\u201d(Emphasis added.)Thus, defendant now argues that the evidence \u201cwould have allowed a reasonable jury to infer that the substance in defendant\u2019s pipe <em>was </em>the stems, leaves or flowers of the cannabis plant as described in ORS 475.864 and in defendant\u2019s requested instruction.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b703-6\">In response, the state acknowledges that \u201cdefendant has shifted his argument slightly on appeal [,]\u201d but it does not contend that the argument that defendant makes to this court is unpreserved. Instead, the state argues that it presented unrebutted evidence that\u201cconclusively established that defendant possessed hashish.\u201d Consequently, the state concludes, no evidence would have supported a jury finding that defendant actually had possessed only dried marijuana, and defendant therefore was not entitled to a jury instruction on that point.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"680\">*680</page-number>We reject defendant\u2019s argument, but not for the reason advanced by the state. Our decision in this case is driven by our duty to determine, <em>sua sponte, </em>whether the arguments that an appellant raises on appeal are adequately preserved for our review. <em>See State v. Tryon, </em>242 Or App 51, 53 n 1, 255 P3d 498 (2011) (describing obligation). That obligation persists even when, as here, the respondent takes the position that the appellant\u2019s argument is preserved. <em>See State v. Wentworth, </em>252 Or App 129, 134-35, 284 P3d 1250 (2012) (rejecting argument as unpreserved despite the respondent\u2019s concession of preservation, which was \u201cnot well taken\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b704-4\">Generally speaking, a criminal defendant is entitled to a jury instruction if the instruction \u201ccorrectly states the law,\u201d the instruction is \u201cbased on [the defendant\u2019s] theory of the case[,]\u201d and the record includes evidence supporting that theory. <em>State v. Baty, </em>243 Or App 77, 83, 259 P3d 98 (2011). In this case, a preservation problem arises because the theory of the case that defendant presented to the trial court differs significantly from the theory that he advances on appeal. Defendant\u2019s argument to the trial court was premised entirely on his theory that the state had to prove that he <em>knew </em>that he possessed hashish, not just dried marijuana. That is, defendant argued only that he was entitled to the instruction because jurors could find, based on the evidence presented, that defendant had believed that he was smoking dried marijuana and \u2014 if the jury so found \u2014 the state would have failed to prove the requisite mental state under ORS 475.840(3) (2009). The trial court\u2019s colloquy with the parties reveals that it understood defendant\u2019s argument to be directed solely to the <em>mens rea </em>element of the state\u2019s case, as did the prosecutor.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-5\">On appeal, defendant describes a fundamentally different theory of his case. He now argues that he was entitled to the jury instruction because the jurors could have found that he <em>in fact </em>did not possess hashish, but possessed only less than one ounce of dried marijuana. Had defendant presented that theory to the trial court, the parties could have fleshed out their positions on whether the record would allow the jury to infer that defendant had possessed only dried marijuana, the state might have sought to introduce <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"681\">*681</page-number>additional evidence on that point (the discussion about the requested special instruction occurred before the parties presented their evidence), and \u2014 depending on the outcome of those events \u2014 the trial court might have decided to give the instruction. Thus, defendant did not \u201cprovide the trial court with an explanation\u201d of his <em>present </em>theory that was \u201cspecific enough to ensure that the court [could] identify its alleged error with enough clarity to permit it to consider and correct the error immediately, if correction [were] warranted [,]\u201d as is necessary to preservation. <em>State v. Wyatt, </em>331 Or 335, 343, 15 P3d 22 (2000) (explaining preservation principles). Nor did defendant \u201cidentiffy] the asserted error to the trial court\u201d with the \u201cparticularity\u201d required by ORCP 59 H. Accordingly, the argument that defendant makes on appeal is not adequately preserved for our review, and we do not address it.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b700-8\"> The trooper testified that hashish is \u201ca concentrated form of marijuana\u201d that is \u201cessentially the resin of cannabis \u2014 the plant.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b702-10\"> We explained in <em>Engen </em>that, under the statutes at issue in that case, including a predecessor to OES 475.840(3) (2009), \u201c[a] person who possesses a controlled substance, believing it to be a controlled substance, assumes the risk of\u2018mistake\u2019 as to the precise nature of the substance.\u201d 164 Or App at 608. Accordingly, the state was \u201cnot required to prove a defendant\u2019s knowledge of the particular type of controlled substance possessed.\u201d id. at 609.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
