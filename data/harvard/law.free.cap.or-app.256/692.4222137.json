He appeals the resulting convictions and sentences, advancing multiple assignments of error. We write to address one of those assignments and reject the others without discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-5\">In his third assignment of error, defendant argues that, on each of the three convictions for criminal mistreatment, the trial court imposed 36-months of post-prison supervision, which, when added to defendant\u2019s 36-month prison term, exceeded the five-year statutory maximum indeterminate sentence for those class C felonies. ORS 161.605(3) (maximum term of an indeterminate sentence of imprisonment is, \u201c[flor a Class C felony, 5 years\u201d); OAR 213-005-0002(4) (\u201cThe term of post-prison supervision, when added to the prison term, shall not exceed the statutory maximum indeterminate sentence for the crime of conviction.\u201d). The state concedes that the 72-month sentences imposed by the trial court are plainly erroneous, and we agree. <em>See State v. Donner, </em>230 Or App 465, 469, 215 P3d 928 (2009) (trial court plainly erred in imposing a \u201ctotal sentence of 72 months \u2014 36 months\u2019 incarceration and 36 months\u2019 post-prison supervision \u2014 on a Class C felony\u201d). For the same reasons expressed in <em>Dormer, </em>we exercise our discretion to correct the error in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-6\">Remanded for resentencing; otherwise affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
