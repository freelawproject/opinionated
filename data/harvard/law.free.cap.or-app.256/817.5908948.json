ORS 813.010.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> After the court gave its jury instructions but before deliberations had begun, a juror asked the court whether Ambien, a central nervous system depressant, was a controlled substance. In response, the court did not answer the juror\u2019s question and instead indicated that the jury was to proceed to deliberations, having heard all the evidence and the jury instructions. On appeal, defendant assigns error to the trial court\u2019s failure to instruct the jury further that defendant\u2019s Ambien use was irrelevant to the case. First, defendant asserts that the state prosecuted him on the theory that he had used narcotics and was impaired by narcotics, not Ambien. Second, defendant suggests that, although there was evidence that Ambien is a controlled substance, the state failed to establish, as a matter of law, that defendant was impaired by Ambien. Third, defendant argues that, given the state\u2019s theory and the evidence at trial, the trial court was required to instruct the jury that Ambien was not a relevant controlled substance when it became clear that the jury might consider defendant\u2019s use of Ambien as a basis upon which to convict him. For the following reasons, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-5\">We take the following facts from the record. Officer Hyson was on patrol in the morning when he saw defendant drive through an intersection without stopping at a stop sign. After Hyson pulled over defendant, he asked for defendant\u2019s license, registration, and proof of insurance. After Hyson repeated his request for the three documents, defendant appeared to have difficulty retrieving his license from his wallet. Hyson noticed that defendant\u2019s speech was slow and slightly slurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"819\">*819</page-number>Shortly after Hyson stopped defendant, he became concerned that defendant was having medical problems or was impaired by medication. After denying any immediate medical problems, defendant agreed to take field sobriety tests. When defendant got out of his car, he swayed and stumbled such that Hyson had to place his hand on defendant\u2019s arm until defendant was able to regain his balance. Hyson then administered three field sobriety tests to defendant. Hyson first administered the horizontal gaze nystagmus (HGN) test, an eye examination developed to detect intoxication. Hyson observed nystagmus and six out of the six possible \u201cclues\u201d indicating intoxication. During the HGN test, Hyson did not note the size of defendant\u2019s pupils. For the \u201cwalk-and-turn\u201d test, Hyson asked defendant to walk nine steps in a straight line in a heel-to-toe fashion and then return to the starting position. Defendant was unable to maintain the starting position, needing help from Hyson because he was swaying and stumbling, and then defendant could not walk in a straight line and almost fell when turning. Last, Hyson requested that defendant perform the \u201cone-leg stand\u201d test. Hyson instructed defendant to stand feet together, lift one foot at least six inches off the ground, and remain in that position for approximately 30 seconds. Defendant stated that no one could perform that test, and when defendant lifted his foot off the ground, he began to sway and stumble sideways. Hyson discontinued the test and arrested defendant for DUII.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-4\">At the jail, defendant agreed to provide a urine sample. Bessett, a criminalist at the Oregon State Police Crime Lab, analyzed defendant\u2019s urine sample and prepared a written report. In his written report, Bessett confirmed the following substances present in defendant\u2019s urine sample:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b843-5\">\u201cMethadone, a Schedule II controlled substance and its metabolite EDDP[.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b843-6\">\u201cOxycodone (Oxycontin, Percodan), a Schedule II controlled substance [.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b843-7\">\u201cMorphine, a Schedule II controlled substance and a metabolite of several opiates [.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b843-8\">\u201cCitalopram (Celexa) and/or escitalopram (Lexapro) both prescription controlled anti-depressants [.]\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b844-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"820\">*820</page-number>(Bullet points omitted.) Several days later, the state filed a traffic complaint for one count of DUII. The traffic complaint alleged that defendant was under the influence of \u201ccontrolled substances\u201d but did not specify which ones.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-4\">Bessett testified at trial. Before explaining the findings in his written report, he described his training. In part, he said that he had had training in drug classifications, and he described central nervous system depressants, such as Valium or Ambien, as an example of a drug classification. He also described the effects of a central nervous system depressant: it lowers a person\u2019s heart rate, lowers a person\u2019s breathing rate, and makes the person feel more relaxed.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-5\">With regard to the substances listed in Bessett\u2019s report that were confirmed to be present in defendant\u2019s urine, Bessett explained that methadone is a Schedule II controlled substance that is in the category of narcotic analgesics, which are considered depressants. Side effects of narcotic analgesics, he testified, may include confusion, disorientation, drowsiness, and mental clouding, and so narcotic analgesics may impair mental and physical capabilities. He explained that oxycodone, the active ingredient in Oxycontin and Percodan, and morphine are Schedule II controlled substances too and also are narcotic analgesics with side effects similar to methadone.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Bessett explained the scheduling system for drugs and gave examples of drugs that would fall in each schedule, from Schedule I to Schedule V. Bessett\u2019s example of a Schedule IV drug was Ambien. Bessett testified that methadone, oxycodone, and morphine are detectible in urine from two hours to two days after use. On cross-examination, Bessett testified that, generally, people under the influence of narcotics have \u201cpinprick pupils\u201d and do not display nystagmus when given the HGN test.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"821\">*821</page-number>To some extent, Bessett testified regarding defendant\u2019s possible use of Ambien. He explained during direct examination that he was required to perform two tests on a urine sample: a screening test and a confirmation test. The screening test identifies the presence of a drug and its general type, <em>e.g., </em>narcotic. The next test, the confirming test, identifies the exact drug that is present in the urine sample. He then stated that, although the screening test had identified the presence of two other substances, Ambien and 7-amino Clonazepam, he was unable to find those again on the confirming test. During cross-examination, Bessett agreed that he was \u201cnot offering testimony that those other drugs [Ambien and 7-amino Clonazepam] were actually present because [he] didn\u2019t confirm them.\u201d Defense counsel then questioned Bessett regarding the narcotic analgesics that were confirmed to have been found in defendant\u2019s urine sample.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-4\">In her redirect examination of Bessett, however, the prosecutor returned to the topic of Ambien. Bessett testified that, although narcotic analgesics do not typically cause nystagmus, which defendant exhibited during the HGN test, centralnervoussystemdepressants, such as Ambien, Clonazepam, and other drugs, do cause nystagmus. The prosecutor then asked, \u201c[D]id you find any of those drugs present?\u201d Defense counsel objected on the ground that the question had been \u201casked and answered\u201d and argued that Bessett had already said that he could not confirm them or offer evidence that those types of drugs were actually present. The court overruled the objection, and Bessett testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b845-5\">\u201cI did detect those drugs \u2014 two drugs, Ambien and a drug called 7-Amino Clonazepam, which is a \u2014 like that EEDP, it\u2019s a breakdown product of Clonazepam. And those two drugs are in the category of central nervous system depressants.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b845-6\">Defendant also testified at trial. He stated that he was prescribed the substances found in his urine sample to treat some of his medical issues but denied taking narcotics the morning Hyson arrested him. Defendant explained that he routinely takes his medication after lunch in the mid-afternoon and he had not taken any medication the morning <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"822\">*822</page-number>that he was pulled over. However, defendant volunteered that he might have taken Ambien: \u201cI think at the time the\u2014 the ticket was written, I might have taken Ambien the night before [.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b846-4\">In closing argument, the prosecutor called the jury\u2019s attention to Bessett\u2019s testimony that Ambien would explain the nystagmus that Hyson observed during the HGN test. However, the prosecutor focused on the narcotics and argued that the testing showed that, just as defendant admitted, he used methadone, oxycodone, and morphine every day and that, given Hyson\u2019s observations of defendant\u2019s behavior, there was ample evidence to conclude that defendant was \u201cimpaired by these drugs when he was driving.\u201d Defendant\u2019s counsel argued that the state had presented a case of speculation because Hyson observed nystagmus and there was no evidence of constricted pupils, which contradicted the state\u2019s theory that defendant was under the influence of narcotics.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-5\">After closing arguments, the trial court instructed the jury that, to convict defendant, it needed to find that defendant drove while under the influence of a controlled substance. The trial court also instructed the jury, with the agreement of the parties, that \u201cas a matter of law Methadone, Oxycodone, Percodan, and Morphine are all controlled substances.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b846-6\">After the court instructed the jury but before the jurors left the courtroom to begin deliberations, a juror asked the court a question regarding defendant\u2019s Ambien use:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b846-7\">\u201cJUROR: Okay. The case revolves around the use of Ambien. I have personal experience because I *** was prescribed that for a sleeping disorder a number of years ago, and my question revolves around \u2014 that we\u2019re talking about the narcotics, the \u2014 the three narcotics, and my question is, is Ambien considered a narcotic in \u2014 or a controlled substance in this particular case. We didn\u2019t receive testimony one way or another and I think that might factor into my decision.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b846-8\">In response to the juror\u2019s question, the court told the jurors that they had heard all of the evidence and jury instructions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"823\">*823</page-number>in the case and explained that the court would not comment on the evidence presented to the jury:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b847-4\">\u201cTHE COURT: Okay. Well, here\u2019s what I would tell you, is, is that all of the evidence is the evidence that you\u2019ve heard and all of the instructions are the ones that I\u2019ve given you. And this is one of the many reasons why we have more than one person as a jury to decide this. And even though that\u2019s how you categorize it that way, you may find that your jurors will assist you in thinking of it in a different way or the same way, but help you decide that. I don\u2019t know.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b847-5\">\u201cBut all of this falls within the category of what the jury decides. I\u2019m not the one that puts on the evidence and I\u2019m not the one that gets to comment on it. That\u2019s something [that] is perhaps for you to ask your fellow jurors, and one of the things that comes up. But, again, I\u2019m not even saying that.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b847-6\">After the jury left, defendant objected to the court\u2019s response to the juror\u2019s question and contended that the court should instruct the jury that Ambien was not relevant to the case:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b847-7\">\u201c[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: With regard to the juror\u2019s question, I \u2014 I think it \u2014 had that been submitted formally, I\u2019m going to treat it as such, even though it was an oral question not a written question, that <em>I think [that] the appropriate instruction of the Court would be that Ambien\u2019s not relevant to the case </em>(indiscernible). But there was \u2014 the State has charged controlled substance, to-wit: Ambien\u2014 it\u2019s not Ambien, excuse me, the various narcotics that were listed.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b847-9\">(Emphasis added.) The court determined that the juror\u2019s question related to a factual matter for the jury to decide.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-10\">Later, during deliberations, the jury told the bailiff that they were split and submitted a written question to the court. The trial judge called the prosecutor and defense counsel back to the courtroom and read them the jury question: \u201cDoes the charge DUII * * * mean * * * under the influence * * * or * * * required impairment to drive ***?\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) After hearing from counsel for the parties, the court reinstructed the jury as to the elements of DUII and restated that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AL_\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"824\">*824</page-number>\u201cthe following substances are controlled substances. So, in other words, in addition to anything you heard about this, in terms of evidence, it is also true as a matter of law that Methadone, Oxycodone, Percodan and Morphine are controlled substances as a matter of law.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b848-4\">The jury then found defendant guilty of DUII, and the trial court sentenced defendant to two years of enhanced bench probation, subject to general and special conditions.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-5\">On appeal, defendant assigns error to the trial court\u2019s failure to instruct the jury that defendant\u2019s Ambien use was not a relevant controlled substance for which to convict defendant, relying on a three-step argument. First, defendant asserts that the state prosecuted him on the theory that he had used narcotics and was impaired by narcotics, not Ambien. Second, in a related vein, defendant contends that, although there was evidence that Ambien is a controlled substance, as a matter of law, the state failed to establish that defendant was impaired by Ambien because there was no evidence as to the effects Ambien has on a person\u2019s ability to drive, the amount of Ambien present in defendant\u2019s urine sample, or the amount of Ambien that could impair a person\u2019s driving. Third, defendant argues that, given the state\u2019s theory and the evidence at trial, the trial court was required to instruct the jury that Ambien was not a relevant controlled substance when it became clear that the jury might consider defendant\u2019s use of Ambien as a basis upon which to convict him. In defendant\u2019s view, his requested jury instruction was not an impermissible comment on the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-6\">The state argues that defendant has preserved only a narrow issue for appeal: whether the court was required to instruct the jury that Ambien was not relevant to the case. The state points out that, in response to the juror\u2019s question, defendant requested that the court instruct the jury that \u201cAmbien\u2019s not relevant to the case [.] \u201d The state contends that defendant is now arguing points that he did not preserve for appeal, namely, that the court\u2019s instruction to the jury was misleading and that the evidence relating to Ambien was insufficient for a jury to have found defendant guilty of DUII. We therefore begin our analysis by addressing preservation.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"825\">*825</page-number>To preserve an issue for appeal, a party\u2019s explanation must be \u201cspecific enough to ensure that the court can identify its alleged error with enough clarity to permit it to consider and correct the error immediately, if correction is warranted.\u201d <em>State v. Wyatt, </em>331 Or 335, 343, 15 P3d 22 (2000). As the state acknowledges, defendant properly preserved the issue of whether the trial court was required to instruct the jury that Ambien was irrelevant to the case; defendant specifically requested that the court instruct the jury that Ambien was irrelevant. We also note that defendant objected to the court\u2019s response to the jury\u2019s question and requested the Ambien instruction because the state had accused defendant of being under the influence of \u201cthe various narcotics that were listed.\u201d That was sufficient to alert the state and the court of his position that the state\u2019s theory could not change from narcotics use to Ambien use. We also conclude that defendant\u2019s additional arguments \u2014 that the court\u2019s instruction to the jury was misleading and that the evidence relating to Ambien was insufficient for a jury to convict him \u2014 were preserved insofar as they support his argument that the court should have instructed the jury that Ambien was not a relevant controlled substance.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-4\">We turn, then, to the merits of defendant\u2019s assignment of error \u2014 whether the court was required to instruct the jury that evidence of Ambien was irrelevant to convict defendant of DUII. As previously noted, defendant argues that his requested jury instruction \u2014 that Ambien was not relevant\u2014 was a correct statement of the law and, therefore, was not an impermissible comment on the evidence. The state argues that the jury was entitled to rely on the Ambien evidence admitted in the case to reach its verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-5\">We begin our analysis of the merits by addressing the applicable standard of review. Although the parties agree that our standard of review is for legal error, they differ over the legal question presented. Defendant cites <em>Jones v. Baldwin, </em>163 Or App 507, 511-12, 990 P2d 345 (1999), and asserts that we must determine whether the trial court\u2019s answer to the juror\u2019s question could have misled the jury.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"826\">*826</page-number>contends that the jury was misled because \u201cAmbien was not a valid controlled substance from which the jury could find that defendant committed DUII The state, however, cites <em>State v. Maciel-Cortes, </em>231 Or App 302, 218 P3d 900 (2009), and contends that we must determine whether defendant\u2019s additional requested jury instruction \u2014 that Ambien is irrelevant to the case \u2014 constituted an improper comment on the evidence. The disputed question the parties present to us relates to a factual issue that was raised by evidence presented at trial, namely, defendant\u2019s use of Ambien. We therefore agree with the state that <em>Maciel-Cortes </em>governs. We review whether a jury instruction \u2014 requested or given \u2014 is a comment on the evidence for legal error. <em>Maciel-Cortes, </em>231 Or App at 305 (citing <em>State v. Blanchard, </em>165 Or App 127, 130, 995 P2d 1200, <em>rev den, </em>331 Or 429 (2000)).</p>\n<p id=\"b850-4\">Under ORCP 59 E, a trial court \u201cshall not instruct\u201d the jury \u201cwith respect to matters of fact\u201d or comment on the evidence. <em>See </em>ORS 136.330(1) (ORCP 59 is applicable in criminal cases). \u201cA court impermissibly comments on the evidence when it gives a jury instruction that tells the jury how specific evidence relates to a particular legal issue.\u201d <em>State v. Hayward, </em>327 Or 397, 410-11, 963 P2d 667 (1998). Defendant argues that his requested instruction was not an impermissible comment on the evidence because Ambien did not relate to any legal issue in the case. Our resolution of the issue is driven by two related, but separate conclusions: (1) defendant did not follow the proper procedure to exclude evidence of Ambien from the record, and (2) his requested jury instruction was not legally correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-5\">First, defendant\u2019s request for a jury instruction was not the proper procedure to exclude evidence already in the record. The state presented evidence related to Ambien multiple times during the trial. Bessett testified that, in his screening test, he detected, but was unable to confirm, that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"827\">*827</page-number>Ambien was a substance present in defendant\u2019s urine sample. Bessett stated that Ambien is a Schedule IV central nervous system depressant that, generally, lowers a person\u2019s heart rate, lowers a person\u2019s breathing rate, and makes the person feel more relaxed. Bessett also explained that drugs like Ambien can cause nystagmus, which Hyson observed when he administered the HGN test.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-4\">At no point during the state\u2019s presentation of evidence at trial did defendant try to inform the court that the state\u2019s evidence regarding Ambien should be excluded based on relevance grounds; defendant did not object to or move to strike the state\u2019s evidence of defendant\u2019s Ambien use or its effects. <em>See State v. Keller, </em>315 Or 273, 283, 844 P2d 195 (1993) (citing OEC 103(1)(a) and noting that an objection is considered \u201ctimely\u201d if it is made when the offered evidence is known to the opposing party and when the trial court has the basis to properly assess its admissibility). Nor did defendant request an instruction limiting the state\u2019s evidence of Ambien for the purpose of explaining the schedules of controlled substances. <em>See </em>OEC 105 (\u201cWhen evidence which is admissible as to one party or for one purpose but not admissible as to another party or for another purpose is admitted, the court, upon request, shall restrict the evidence to its proper scope and instruct the jury accordingly.\u201d). Moreover, when defendant testified, he admitted that he \u201cmight have taken an Ambien\u201d the night before he was pulled over for DUII.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-5\">Defendant could have taken steps to exclude or to limit any testimony regarding Ambien during the evidentiary phase of the trial. Notably, defendant\u2019s counsel did move to strike the state\u2019s evidence of defendant\u2019s use of the antidepressants citalopram and escitalopram, and their effects, as irrelevant, and the trial court excluded testimony concerning those drugs. Defendant\u2019s counsel could have moved to strike the evidence concerning Ambien as well, or could have requested a limiting instruction, and he should have done so before defendant testified about his Ambien use. In this case, however, after the evidentiary record was closed, all of the evidence concerning Ambien was in the record. Regardless of whether the evidence of Ambien <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"828\">*828</page-number>was actually relevant to the case, the jury was entitled to consider that evidence because it had been admitted without objection from either party. Thus, defendant was in no position to challenge that evidence as irrelevant for the first time through a proposed peremptory jury instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-4\">Second, we conclude that defendant\u2019s requested jury instruction \u2014 that Ambien is \u201cnot relevant to the case\u201d \u2014 was not a correct statement of the law. <em>See Williams v. Philip Morris Inc., </em>344 Or 45, 56, 176 P3d 1255 (2008) (stating the principle that there is no error in a trial court\u2019s refusal to give a proposed jury instruction if that instruction is not legally correct). For defendant\u2019s requested jury instruction to be legally correct, we would have to conclude that, as a matter of law, Ambien was not relevant for the purpose of convicting defendant of DUII. As previously explained, both the state and defendant presented evidence of Ambien. The state presented evidence that (1) during the HGN test, defendant displayed nystagmus and, unlike narcotics, central nervous system depressants, like Ambien, cause nystagmus; and (2) Ambien is a controlled substance. Apparently in an attempt to contradict the state\u2019s evidence of his impairment by narcotics, defendant testified that he might have taken an Ambien, consistent with his display of nystagmus. Defendant\u2019s testimony about his Ambien use, and the other evidence concerning Ambien, was relevant to explain the observation of nystagmus and to the question of whether defendant drove while under the influence of \u201ccontrolled substances.\u201d If the court had instructed the jury that Ambien was irrelevant, that instruction would have been legally incorrect. Accordingly, we conclude that the trial court did not err when it did not give defendant\u2019s requested jury instruction and affirm the judgment of conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b842-6\"> ORS 813.010(1) provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b842-7\">\u201cA person commits the offense of driving while under the influence of intoxicants if the person drives a vehicle while the person:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b842-8\">sH * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b842-9\">\u201c(b) Is under the influence of intoxicating liquor, a controlled substance or an inhalant!.]\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b844-6\"> Bessett also described citalopram and escitalopram as prescription antidepressants, but noted that they did not have any relevant side effects alone or combined with other drugs. Defendant\u2019s counsel moved to strike the evidence of citalopram and escitalopram as irrelevant because those drugs are not controlled substances and do not have any additive effects when combined with other drugs. The court sustained defendant\u2019s motion and excluded any further discussion of them.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b849-6\"> We conclude that <em>Jones </em>is inapposite to this case. In <em>Jones, </em>the jury submitted a written question during deliberations regarding the elements of conspiracy to commit murder: \u201cIs the defendant guilty of conspiracy if he did indeed make a plan <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"826\">*826</page-number>with others to kill <em>or </em>must it be proved that the defendant was definitely serious, and fully intended to go through with the plan?\u201d 163 Or App at 510 (emphasis in original). The jury\u2019s question was submitted in the disjunctive, but the trial court answered, \u2018Yes\u201d to both questions. <em>Id. </em>We determined that the trial court\u2019s instruction was illogical and, therefore, prejudicial. <em>Id. </em>at 511-13. In this case, however, defendant is not arguing that the trial court\u2019s response to the juror\u2019s question was incorrect. Instead, defendant contends that the trial court was required to give his requested jury instruction \u2014 that Ambien was not relevant.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
