The second case (the 2006 case) concerns, as pertinent here, the resultant revocation of defendant\u2019s probation and imposition of additional terms of incarceration on defendant\u2019s prior 2006 convictions due to his \u201cnew criminal conduct\u201d in connection with the 2010 case.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-5\">Defendant first appeals the April 2010 judgment of conviction, assigning error to the trial court\u2019s denial of his motion to suppress evidence obtained after police entered his home without a warrant in violation of Article I, section 9, of the Oregon Constitution and the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution. Specifically, he argues that the court erroneously determined that (1) one of the home\u2019s occupants consented to the warrantless entry merely by moving out of the way just before an officer walked through the doorway with his weapon drawn and (2) a second person, also a suspect, consented to the search by walking toward that same officer as he stood in the doorway. That is, challenging the trial court\u2019s determination that \u201c[t]here was consent by conduct!,]\u201d he asserts that, \u201c[a]t most, the people in the home <em>acquiesced </em>to the officerf\u2019s] armed entry into the home.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> (Emphasis added.) Addressing defendant\u2019s first argument, the state responds that the occupant in question moved out of the doorway \u201cwithout being prompted and before the officer tried to enter!,]\u201d thereby voluntarily consenting to the officer\u2019s entry.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b402-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>Defendant next appeals the order and judgment\u2014 issued on the same date as the judgment in the 2010 case\u2014 revoking his probation and imposing 24 months\u2019 additional incarceration on the convictions in the 2006 case. He assigns error to the trial court\u2019s denial of his motion to dismiss and terminate probation, asserting that the court earlier extended his probation \u201cwithout securing a valid waiver of his right to a hearing with counsel\u201d in violation of both Article I, section 11, of the Oregon Constitution and the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution. In other words, defendant contends that he should not have been on probation at all in 2010 because the order extending his probation beyond November 2009, when it was originally set to expire, was constitutionally invalid. The state responds, first, that defendant\u2019s argument to that effect constitutes an impermissible collateral attack on the earlier, appealable order extending his probation. On the merits, it contends that defendant\u2019s prior experience with the criminal justice system supports a finding that he understood his right to counsel and thus \u201cknowingly waived the right to have counsel assist him at a probation violation hearing\u201d before the order extending his probation issued.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-4\">As to the first assignment of error, we agree with defendant and, accordingly, reverse and remand. Given that disposition, we reverse the order and judgment addressed by defendant\u2019s second assignment of error because, absent defendant\u2019s conviction in the 2010 case, no \u201cnew criminal conduct\u201d exists that would permit the imposition of probation revocation sanctions in the 2006 case.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-5\">We review a trial court\u2019s denial of a motion to suppress for legal error and defer to its findings of fact provided that there is sufficient evidence in the record to support them. <em>State v. Ehly, </em>317 Or 66, 75, 854 P2d 421 (1993). Absent express findings of fact, and where there is evidence in the record based upon which disputed factual issues could be decided in more than one way, we presume that the trial court decided the facts in a manner consistent with its ultimate conclusion. <em>Ball v. Gladden, </em>250 Or 485, 487, 443 P2d 621 (1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b403-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>On March 11, 2010, Multnomah County Sheriff\u2019s Deputy Tyrus was dispatched to a Wal-Mart parking lot due to a reported vehicle break-in. Upon arrival, Tyrus spoke with the victim, who confirmed the break-in and reported that an electric \u201cSkilsaw,\u201d a bottle of medication, two credit cards, and over $100 worth of groceries had been stolen out of his red Ford Explorer. Tyrus then spoke with the security officer on duty at Wal-Mart, who provided him with a surveillance video of the parking lot. That video depicted, in relevant part, two people entering Wal-Mart, leaving, stopping at the victim\u2019s red Ford Explorer, removing the items in question from it, and then leaving the parking lot through a hole in a fence leading to an adjacent mobile home park. Each person in the surveillance video was wearing a distinctive article of clothing; one person was wearing a black hooded sweatshirt associated with the University of Oregon, with the word \u201cOregon\u201d printed repeatedly over the entire sweatshirt, and the other was wearing a New York Yankees baseball cap \u201cwith a really unique design on it\u201d consisting of a \u201cdiamonds and sparkles kind of thing.\u201d After viewing the video, Tyrus obtained a printed copy of a still-frame image depicting one of the suspects\u2019 faces. He then contacted deputies Lazzini and Reed for assistance, as he knew that they \u201chad contacts within the area.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b403-4\">When Lazzini and Reed arrived, all three officers went to the mobile home park and showed the still-frame image to the officers\u2019 unnamed contact there. The contact identified the suspect depicted in that image, defendant, as \u201cDJ\u201d and directed the officers to defendant\u2019s residence. The three officers proceeded to that residence, and Tyrus knocked on the front door. A woman later identified as Fuller opened the door, having just woken up, and Tyrus asked her, \u201c[Are] there two guys here?\u201d Immediately after asking that question, and while positioned \u201cto the side of the door\u201d for safety reasons, Tyrus observed \u201cone of the suspects that [he] recognize [d] from the [Wal-Mart surveillance] video\u201d \u2014 still wearing the distinctive New York Yankees hat \u2014 walking out of the kitchen. The suspect, later identified as Pipgrass, was carrying a plate of food and a large kitchen knife.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-5\">At that point, Tyrus \u2014 still just outside the door-frame \u2014 ceased interaction with Fuller, drew his gun, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>commanded Pipgrass to put down the food and knife and \u201cget his hands up.\u201d Pipgrass complied, Tyrus motioned for Pipgrass to walk toward him, and, as Pipgrass did so, Tyrus yelled, \u201cWhere\u2019s DJ?\u201d Immediately thereafter, Tyrus heard a voice from an adjacent room ask, \u201cWho the fuck is looking for DJ?\u201d Tyrus responded, \u201cThis is the police [,]\u201d and proceeded to enter the home with his gun drawn, followed by Reed.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> According to Tyrus\u2019s testimony, the sequence of events occurred \u201c[p]retty quick [,]\u201d and Fuller \u201cg[ot] out of the way\u201d by \u201cslid[ing] over\u201d against the wall just before Tyrus entered the home and as Pipgrass was moving toward the doorway pursuant to Tyrus\u2019s instructions. More specifically, Tyrus\u2019s testimony indicates that Fuller \u201cmoved against the wall\u201d in her effort to \u201cget[ ] out of the way\u201d just after Tyrus\u2014 gun drawn \u2014 yelled, \u201cWhere\u2019s DJ?\u201d while interacting with Pipgrass immediately before entering the home. For her part, Fuller testified that, upon seeing Pipgrass walk out of the kitchen, the officers, led by Tyrus, began \u201cshoving their way in.\u201d At no point did any of the officers request Fuller\u2019s consent to enter the home.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-4\">After stepping through the doorway, Tyrus saw defendant \u201cbuilding like an entertainment center in the living room off to the left.\u201d Defendant then walked around a couch toward the officers, and Tyrus recognized him as the second suspect depicted in the surveillance video and still-frame image. Tyrus and Reed immediately arrested and handcuffed defendant and Pipgrass, both of whom \u201ctotally followed orders and were compliant\u201d with the officers\u2019 directives. Tyrus ordered Pipgrass to sit on a couch, and in doing so he observed the distinctive University of Oregon sweatshirt depicted in the surveillance video lying on top of that couch. In order to separate the suspects, Reed immediately took defendant outside; Lazzini then seated him on a bench and read him his <em>Miranda </em>rights. Ultimately, defendant confessed to the crime, and the property stolen from the red Ford Explorer was found in his bedroom.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b405-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>After being charged with unlawful entry into a motor vehicle and second-degree theft in connection with the events of March 11, 2010, defendant moved to suppress \u201call oral and physical evidence obtained after the officers entered defendant\u2019s home.\u201d A hearing was held on April 15, 2010, at which defendant argued that, among other things, the evidence should have been suppressed due to the officers\u2019 \u201cillegal entry\u201d into his home \u2014 that is, because the officers \u201centered his home without consent, exigent circumstances or an arrest warrant.\u201d The state principally argued that exigent circumstances justified the officers\u2019 entry into defendant\u2019s home. Alternatively, it argued that Fuller\u2019s \u201cconduct in this particular case gave consent\u201d and further posited that Pipgrass may have been \u201cmeeting [Tyrus] halfway\u201d and thus consenting to Tyrus\u2019s entry when Pipgrass moved forward in response to Tyrus\u2019s gesture requesting that he do so. Defendant objected to the state\u2019s argument regarding Fuller\u2019s purported consent, but the trial court ultimately denied defendant\u2019s motion on that basis, concluding, as noted, that consent to enter the home had been manifested \u201cby conduct.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Defendant was then convicted on both charges following a trial on stipulated facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-4\">On appeal, defendant reprises his contentions below, arguing that \u201c[a] 11 [oral and physical] evidence derived from the unlawful entry and arrest should have been suppressed\u201d due to the officers\u2019 purportedly unlawful entry into his home in violation of both Article I, section 9, and the Fourth Amendment. He contends that the trial court erred in concluding that there was consent \u201cby conduct\u201d and argues that, at best, Fuller\u2019s actions constituted \u201cmere acquiescence\u201d to the officers\u2019 authority. That is, defendant argues, Fuller <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>merely \u201cstepped out of the way\u201d of an officer wielding a gun and interacting with a suspect located directly behind her\u2014 an act that did not provide Tyrus or Reed with consent to enter the home. The state responds to defendant\u2019s first assignment of error solely by arguing that Fuller consented to the officers\u2019 entry when she \u201cstepp [ed] out of the doorway without being prompted and <em>before </em>the officer tried to enter.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Specifically, the state emphasizes that, during the chain of events described above, Fuller had already moved \u201cout of the way\u201d when Tyrus took his first step into the home.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-4\">We conclude that Fuller\u2019s actions did not, as a matter of law, constitute consent to the officers\u2019 entry. Rather, as defendant correctly asserts, Fuller\u2019s sliding against the wall \u2014 out of the line of fire \u2014 at best amounted to \u201cmere acquiescence\u201d to police authority. <em>See State v. Jepson, </em>254 Or App 290, 294, 292 P3d 660 (2012) (\u201c[A] defendant\u2019s \u2018mere acquiescence\u2019 to police authority does not constitute consent!.]\u201d (Citations omitted.)). And, although the record supports the state\u2019s assertion that Fuller moved aside before Tyrus took his first step into the home, that fact does not convert Fuller\u2019s actions into consent under these circumstances. In effect, the state\u2019s argument boils down to a conclusion that, by the \u201cact\u201d of <em>not </em>blocking the doorway\u2014 <em>i.e., </em>declining to stand between a loaded gun and a criminal suspect \u2014 Fuller consented to the officers\u2019 entry. That conclusion is not supported by the record, case law, or common sense.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-5\">As this court noted in <em>State v. Martin, </em>222 Or App 138, 143, 193 P3d 993 (2008), <em>rev den, </em>345 Or 690 (2009), \u201cwhether a defendant consents to police entry when she opens a door and then retreats <em>depends on the particular facts in each case.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) <em>See also State v. Doyle, </em>186 Or App 504, 510-11, 63 P3d 1253, <em>rev den, </em>335 Or 655 (2003) (\u201cAt most, in failing to immediately object, defendant acquiesced [to] the officers\u2019 entry. Her silence did not establish that she had consented to that entry from the outset.\u201d). We did acknowledge in <em>Martin </em>that \u201c[w]e can imagine situations in which [opening a door and retreating] would amount to a tacit invitation to enter\u201d and in fact noted that the \u201cdefendant\u2019s actions might have sent an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>ambiguous message [.]\u201d 222 Or App at 143-44. However, after considering \u201call of the circumstances\u201d \u2014 most prominently \u201cthe crucial fact * * * that, after opening the door, [the] defendant \u2014 completely <em>unclothed </em>\u2014 ran <em>away and retreated </em>into her bedroom\u201d \u2014 we held that the defendant\u2019s actions did not amount to anything more than \u201cpassive acquiescence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 144 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b407-4\">\u201c[T]he particular facts in [this] case\u201d \u2014 considering \u201call of the circumstances\u201d \u2014 are far less ambiguous than those in <em>Martin. </em>Notably, Tyrus himself explicitly acknowledged at the hearing that Fuller was \u201cgetting out of the way\u201d (that is, \u201cretreating]\u201d) when she stepped out of the line of fire by \u201csliding] over\u201d against the wall during Tyrus\u2019s interaction with Pipgrass. Moreover, as we recently reiterated in <em>Jepson, </em>mere acquiescence \u201c\u2018occurs when an individual is not given a reasonable opportunity to choose to consent ***.\u2019\u201d 254 Or App at 294-95 (quoting <em>Berg, </em>223 Or App at 392); <em>see State v. Guzman, </em>164 Or App 90, 99, 990 P2d 370 (1999), <em>rev den, </em>331 Or 191 (2000) (similar). Here, Fuller woke up and opened the door in response to a knock, remained in the doorway very briefly as a rapid series of events involving an armed officer\u2019s confrontation with a suspect unfolded, and then slid against a hallway wall \u2014 out of the line of fire \u2014 in her effort to get \u201cout of the way.\u201d That conduct is most appropriately characterized as an attempt to get out of harm\u2019s way rather than a tacit manifestation of consent to Tyrus\u2019s entry.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> On those facts, particularly given that the events preceding the officers\u2019 entry occurred quickly (and primarily involved interaction between Tyrus and Pipgrass), we cannot conclude that Fuller was \u201cgiven a reasonable opportunity to choose to consent.\u201d <em>Jepson, </em>254 Or App at 294-95 (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). Rather, the only choice with which she was presented given the rapid progression of events was whether to remain between a loaded gun and a criminal suspect.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>In sum, considering \u201call of the circumstances\u201d and \u201cthe particular facts in [this] case\u201d \u2014 namely the fact that Tyrus drew his gun and was engaged with a suspect directly behind Fuller, the short time frame during which the events occurred, and the fact that Fuller\u2019s consent was never requested \u2014 we conclude that the state has not demonstrated \u201cthat [Fuller\u2019s] actions amounted to anything more than passive acquiescence.\u201d <em>Martin, </em>222 Or App at 144.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-4\">Accordingly, the officers unlawfully entered defendant\u2019s home without a warrant in violation of Article I, section 9. The trial court therefore erred in denying defendant\u2019s motion to suppress the evidence derived from that unlawful entry.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>Cf. State v. Davis, </em>295 Or 227, 243, 666 P2d 802 (1983) (\u201cHaving determined that the entry was unlawful, we need not address the subsequent searches and seizures as they are the direct consequence of the unlawful entry.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b408-5\">A145681 and A145682 reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b401-6\"> The trial court found that there were \u201cclearly no exigent circumstances\u201d justifying entry, and, on appeal, the state neither contests that conclusion nor advances any argument regarding exigent circumstances.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b401-7\"> The state offers no argument on appeal regarding the second suspect\u2019s conduct as it relates to the issue of consent, and it is unclear whether the trial court in fact based its ruling on that conduct. Regardless, to the extent that the trial court concluded that the second suspect\u2019s conduct constituted consent, we reject that conclusion because, as illustrated in our opinion, the suspect was merely walking forward in response to an armed police officer\u2019s directive to do so. <em>Cf. State v. Berg, </em>223 Or App 387, 392, 196 P3d 547 (2008), <em>adh\u2019d to as modified on recons, </em>228 Or App 754, 208 P3d 1006, <em>rev den, </em>346 Or 361 (2009) (noting that voluntary consent is not given where a person complies with \u201c\u2018the language of a command\u2019\u201d (quoting <em>State v. Lowe, </em>144 Or App 313, 318, 926 P2d 332 (1996))).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b404-5\"> No evidence was adduced as to whether Reed also drew his weapon as Fuller stood in the doorway while Tyrus interacted with Pipgrass or as he and Tyrus entered the home. Tyrus, given his position in front of Reed, simply testified, \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b404-6\"> The record does not provide any information regarding the apparent search of defendant\u2019s bedroom \u2014 nor is it clear regarding the particulars of defendant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>confession. Below, the parties put forth conflicting evidence as to whether Lazzini asked defendant if he understood his rights after Lazzini read him the <em>Miranda </em>warnings; although it was not noted in her report, Lazzini testified that defendant stated that he understood his rights, while defendant testified that, immediately after Lazzini read the warnings, she asked \u201c[i]f [defendant] wanted to talk about it.\u201d In any event, the record indicates only that defendant agreed to talk with Lazzini, initially expressed confusion as to why he was being arrested, and then \u2014 at some unspecified point in time \u2014 confessed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"Ab2\"> As noted, the trial court did not specifically attribute the consent \u201cby conduct\u201d to either Fuller or Pipgrass. However, on appeal the state addresses only Fuller\u2019s conduct, and, as set forth above, to the extent that the trial court concluded that Pipgrass voluntarily consented to Tyrus\u2019s entry, we reject that conclusion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b407-5\"> On that point, the record suggests that Fuller slid against the wall just after Tyrus <em>\u201cyelled </em>to [Pipgrass], \u201cWhere\u2019s DJ?\u201d\u2019 (Emphasis added.) In other words, Fuller slid against the wall as the situation began to escalate. Moreover, given Pipgrass\u2019s location behind Fuller, the sequence of events suggests that Tyrus effectively \u201cyelled\u201d at <em>Fuller.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b408-6\"> The state neither argued below nor argues on appeal that defendant\u2019s confession to Lazzini, made after administration of <em>Miranda </em>warnings, was sufficiently attenuated from the unlawful entry and arrest such that it is admissible. Accordingly, we do not address that issue.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
