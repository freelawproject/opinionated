Because we conclude that the trial court did have that authority, and that the corrected permanency judgment it entered cured the deficiency in the original judgment, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-5\">On April 26, 2012, the juvenile court entered a permanency judgment changing the permanency plan for mother\u2019s child from reunification to adoption. With regard to the services that DHS had provided to reunify mother with the child, the judgment stated that \u201c[t]he services include all services set forth in the exhibits and testimony at this hearing.\u201d But the judgment did not include \u201ca brief description of the efforts that the department has made with regard to the case plan in effect at the time of the permanency hearing,\u201d as required by ORS 419B.476(5)(a). The juvenile court\u2019s failure to include, or adopt as its own findings, a brief description of DHS\u2019s efforts with regard to the case plan is reversible error. <em>See State ex rel DHS v. M.A. (A139693), </em>227 Or App 172, 182-83, 205 P3d 36 (2009) (failure of juvenile court to include a brief description of DHS\u2019s efforts with regard to case plan in effect at the time of hearing as required by ORS 419B.476(5)(a) renders judgment inadequate to meet the requirements of the statute); <em>see also Dept. of Human Services v. H. R., </em>241 Or App 370, 374-75, 250 P3d 427 (2011) (juvenile court\u2019s adoption of DHS summary of services as its own written findings satisfied the requirement of ORS 419B.476(5)(a)).</p>\n<p id=\"b573-6\">ORS 419B.923(1) allows the juvenile court \u201cto modify or set aside any order or judgment made by it\u201d for reasons set out in that statute. The permitted reasons \u201cinclude, but are not limited to\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b573-7\">\u201c(a) Clerical mistakes in judgments, orders or other parts of the record and errors in the order or judgment arising <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>from oversight or omission. These mistakes and errors may be corrected by the court at any time[.]\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b574-3\">Thus, under ORS 419B.923(1)(a), a judgment may be modified (1) to correct a \u201cclerical mistake\u201d in the judgment, or (2) to correct errors in the judgment arising from \u201coversight or omission.\u201d Those types of modifications may be made by the juvenile court at any time, even during the pendency of an appeal. ORS 419B.923(7).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b574-4\">Mother filed a notice of appeal on May 22, 2012. On August 16, 2012, the Appellate Commissioner granted mother\u2019s motion to stay the enforcement of the juvenile court\u2019s April 26, 2012, permanency judgment. On August 28, 2012, DHS filed a motion in the juvenile court to correct the April 26, 2012, permanency judgment. Mother filed an objection to DHS\u2019s motion. After a hearing on October 4, 2012, the juvenile court issued another permanency judgment that included a list of the specific services that DHS had offered to mother. The juvenile court noted in the judgment that the permanency judgment \u201cis corrected, to correct errors of omission. ORS 419B.923.\u201dThe court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b574-5\">\u201cThe court in its initial judgment omitted a sufficiently detailed listing of the specific services DHS offered to Mother. The court, by this corrected judgment, is correcting the omission, pursuant to the authority granted it in ORS 419B.923(1) and (7). *** The failure to list these services was an omission because the record was, and is, replete with a listing of these services, and the court relied on DHS\u2019s provision of or referral to these services, in making its ruling, but omitted to specify them in its original judgment.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b574-6\">The juvenile court entered a completely new permanency judgment, which it labeled as a \u201ccorrected permanency <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>judgment.\u201d Mother filed an Amended Notice of Appeal on October 10, 2012.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b575-4\">At oral argument, mother conceded that the October 4, 2012, corrected permanency judgment satisfies the requirements of ORS 419B.476(5)(a). Nonetheless, mother challenges the juvenile court\u2019s authority to enter the corrected permanency judgment pending appeal. In mother\u2019s view, the juvenile court\u2019s authority under ORS 419B.923(1)(a) to correct an \u201coversight or omission\u201d is so that the court may correct a judgment to reflect what actually occurred at the hearing, but that statute does not authorize the juvenile court to add substantive findings that were never made at the hearing or documented in the court\u2019s judgment. So, for example, mother concedes that, if the juvenile court had made findings on the hearing record as to the services that had been provided by DHS, but had failed to list those services in the judgment, that mistake would constitute an \u201coversight or omission\u201d that the juvenile court could correct through an amended judgment. Here though, mother contends, although the juvenile court <em>explained </em>in its October 4, 2012, corrected permanency judgment that in issuing the April 26, 2012, permanency judgment, it had in fact relied on the many DHS services listed in the record, the hearing record did not reflect findings to that effect by the juvenile court. Furthermore, mother contends there is no indication in the record that the juvenile court actually <em>made </em>an assessment of DHS\u2019s efforts to reunify mother and the child; thus, there was no \u201coversight or omission\u201d that could be corrected pursuant to ORS 419B.923(1)(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b575-5\">DHS responds that, as the juvenile court explained, it had in fact relied on the services described in the record but had failed to list them in the April 26, 2012, judgment. In DHS\u2019s view, ORS 419B.923(1)(a) contemplates the correction of just such an error as an \u201coversight or omission.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b575-6\">The parties\u2019 arguments demonstrate slightly different interpretations of ORS 419B.923(1)(a). In mother\u2019s view, an \u201coversight or omission\u201d occurs when the juvenile court mistakenly omits from the judgment findings that are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>reflected in the record. In DHS\u2019s view, the juvenile court\u2019s explanation that it in fact considered the information, but failed to include it in the written judgment, establishes a basis for the juvenile court\u2019s correction of the judgment pursuant to ORS 419B.923(1)(a). Both parties cite the dictionary definitions of \u201comission\u201d and choose their preferred meanings.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Perhaps because the juvenile court did not mention it, neither party refers us to the dictionary definitions of \u201coversight\u201d: \u201can act of overlooking or something overlooked : omission or error due to inadvertence [.]\u201d <em>Webster\u2019s Third New Int\u2019l Dictionary </em>1610 (unabridged ed 2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b576-4\">We are satisfied that, whichever dictionary definition one cites, the juvenile court\u2019s failure to include in the April 26, 2012, judgment a list of the services that DHS had provided to mother was either an \u201coversight\u201d or an \u201comission.\u201d The juvenile court stated that it had relied on DHS\u2019s provision of services in making its ruling, \u201cbut omitted to specify them in its original judgment.\u201d We have no reason on this record to doubt the court\u2019s statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-5\">Mother asserts, finally, that because ORS 419B.476(5)(a) requires that the juvenile court make its findings, including a brief description of DHS\u2019s efforts, within 20 days of the permanency hearing, the juvenile court lacked authority to <em>correct </em>the judgment after that time. It is true, as mother asserts, that under ORS 419B.476(5)(a), the juvenile court must enter a judgment or order within 20 days of the permanency hearing. However, under ORS 419B.923(l)(a), the juvenile court has authority to correct the judgment \u201cat anytime.\u201dIn at least two cases, we have held that a juvenile court has authority on remand to correct a permanency judgment to include the findings required by ORS 419B.476(5)(a), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>even though the correction would not occur within 20 days of the permanency hearing. <em>See, e.g., Dept. of Human Services v. J.W., </em>239 Or App 596, 244 P3d 922 (2010); <em>Dept. of Human Services v. J. S., </em>239 Or App 594, 244 P3d 923 (2010). In our view, a straightforward reading of ORS 419B.476(5)(a) together with ORS 419B.923(1)(a) also requires the conclusion that a juvenile court has authority to correct an error in its permanency judgment more than 20 days after the permanency hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b574-7\"> ORS 419B.923(7) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b574-8\">\u201cAmotion under subsection (1) of this section may be filed with and decided by the trial court during the time an appeal from a judgment is pending before an appellate court.
