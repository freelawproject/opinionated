He raises seven assignments of error. We write to address only defendant\u2019s fifth assignment of error and reject without discussion the remaining six.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-5\">Defendant argues that the trial court committed plain error when it entered separate convictions for Count 2\u2014 fourth-degree assault \u2014 and Count 3 \u2014 felony fourth-degree assault. Prior to sentencing, the state acknowledged that the guilty verdicts in those counts should merge because Count 2 was a lesser-included offense of Count 3, and the trial court agreed. At sentencing, however, the trial court explained that \u201cCount 2 and Count 3 merge for purposes of sentencing[,]\u201d and defendant did not object. Subsequently, the trial court entered separate convictions on both counts and indicated in the criminal judgment that, \u201cfor the purpose of imposing sentence [,] * * * Count 2 * * * merges with Count 3.\u201d On appeal, the state again acknowledges that Counts 2 and 3 must merge but argues that the judgment adequately did that. We disagree with the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-6\">We have previously held that the precise language that the trial court used in its judgment here fails to merge a defendant\u2019s guilty verdicts. <em>See State v. Earls, </em>246 Or App 578, 586, 267 P3d 171 (2011) (\u201cThe judgment\u2019s language which purports to \u2018merge\u2019 those counts \u2018[f]or the purposes of imposing sentence\u2019 does not serve to merge defendant\u2019s guilty verdicts, and it does not change the fact that the judgment erroneously attributes an additional 12 convictions to defendant.\u201d (Alteration in original.)). Accordingly, we conclude that the trial court\u2019s failure to merge defendant\u2019s guilty verdicts for Counts 2 and 3 constitutes plain error, and, for the reasons stated in <em>State v. Camacho-Alvarez, </em>225 Or App 215, 216, 200 P3d 613 (2009), we conclude that it is appropriate to exercise our discretion to correct the error.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-7\">Convictions on Counts 2 and 3 reversed and remanded with instructions to enter a judgment of conviction for one count of felony fourth-degree assault and for resentencing; otherwise affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
