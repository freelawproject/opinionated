The EAB\u2019s order on reconsideration reached the same conclusion as had its original order, which also denied claimant\u2019s request for benefits. As discussed in more detail below, we reversed and remanded that initial order for reconsideration because we determined that it was not supported by substantial reason. <em>Campbell v. Employment </em>Dept., 245 Or App 573, 581, 263 P3d 1122 (2011) <em>(Campbell I). </em>Claimant contends that the EAB\u2019s order on reconsideration also is flawed; she argues both that the order is not supported by substantial evidence and reason and that the order is inconsistent with our holdingin <em>Campbelll.</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>We disagree and, for the reasons set forth below, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-5\">We review the EAB\u2019s order \u201cfor substantial evidence and errors of law, and to determine whether [its] analysis comports with substantial reason.\u201d <em>SAIF v. Ramos, </em>252 Or App 361, 363, 287 P3d 1220 (2012). Substantial evidence supports afactualfinding\u201cwhen the record, viewed as awhole, would permit a reasonable person to make that finding.\u201d ORS 183.482(8)(c). An order comports with substantial reason when it \u201carticulate [s] a rational connection between the facts of the case and the legal conclusion.\u201d <em>Endres v. DMV, </em>255 Or App 226, 229, 297 P3d 505 (2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b707-6\">In its order on reconsideration, the EAB adopted those factual findings that it had made in its initial order, as summarized in <em>Campbell I, </em>and it also made additional findings. Our decision in this case turns on the EAB\u2019s findings about events immediately surrounding claimant\u2019s December 1, 2009, decision to leave her job. However, <em>Campbell I </em>provides helpful background information regarding events that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"684\">*684</page-number>preceded claimant\u2019s resignation, and we quote from that opinion here:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b708-4\">\u201cClaimant was the director of fiscal services for the Willamette Educational Service District (WESD) from July 1, 2007, until she resigned effective December 1, 2009. Claimant reported directly to WESD\u2019s superintendent; she was responsible for advising the superintendent on all fiscal matters, preparing budget documents, and overseeing the budget process. Her position also required her to authorize expenditures, and, as the EAB found, she \u2018was responsible for their \u201cgood judgment\u201d and \u201clawfulness,\u201d as provided in the Oregon Accounting Manual (OAM) 10.40.00 PO.\u2019 During her employment, claimant held a \u2018certificate of school business management.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b708-5\">\u201cIn October 2008, claimant began voicing concerns about financial improprieties and mismanagement at WESD. One of her concerns centered around the issuance of contracts that claimant contended were in violation of Internal Revenue Service rules and Oregon statutes. She was also concerned that school district funds were being improperly commingled with other funds and not properly reported to the board or in the annual audit. Claimant was disturbed that the superintendent had ordered an increase in the rate that school districts would be charged for WESD\u2019s services, even though the superintendent had been told that the increase was not needed because the amounts collected in the prior year had not yet been spent. The superintendent stated that a less than three percent increase would \u2018look funny\u2019 and cause the districts to ask questions.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b708-6\">245 Or App at 575-76 (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b708-7\">Claimant continued to raise concerns over the next several months, not only with her supervisor, but also with WESD\u2019s auditors, board chair, and legal counsel. <em>Id. </em>at 576. Claimant was away from work on medical leave from early June through late September 2009. During that period, she was dropped from two management e-mail lists and some of her work duties were removed. <em>Id. </em>at 577. After claimant returned to work, she and the deputy superintendent met with WESD\u2019s human resources director in late November 2009. In <em>Campbell I, </em>we described the events culminating in claimant\u2019s ultimate resignation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b709-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"685\">*685</page-number>\u201cDuring the meeting, claimant brought up several concerns about the misuse of funds. She also told the deputy that they were violating independent contractor rules and that \u2018they should not be issuing a bad contract today if they know they are violating the rules.\u2019 The deputy indicated that \u2018they did not have to fix the contracting situation yet, the Secretary of State\u2019s office would give him 4-6 weeks.\u2019[<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>] Claimant said that it was \u2018very difficult for her to do her job\u2019 and that she felt that \u2018she was being retaliated against and intimidated.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b709-4\">\u201cClaimant resigned on December 1, 2009, as EAB described it, \u2018because she believed her concerns were being ignored and that she would be \u201cforced to continue doing * * * improper things\u201d that put her school business manager certification at risk.\u2019\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b709-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 577-78 (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b709-6\">Claimant subsequently sought unemployment insurance benefits, which the Employment Department denied. She then asked for and received a hearing before an administrative law judge (ALJ), who agreed with the department and issued a decision stating that claimant had resigned without \u201cgood cause\u201d to do so and therefore was ineligible for unemployment benefits. In March 2010, claimant sought review by the EAB, which affirmed the ALJ\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-7\">The EAB\u2019s original order \u2014 like the one currently on review \u2014 was based on the interplay between ORS 657.176(2)(c) and OAR 471-030-0038(4). Under ORS 657.176(2)(c), an individual who leaves work \u201cwithout good cause\u201d is disqualified from receiving unemployment insurance benefits. The administrative rule, OAR 471-030-0038(4), clarifies that \u201cgood cause\u201d to resign exists where \u201ca reasonable and prudent person of normal sensitivity, exercising ordinary common sense, would leave work\u201d and the reason for resigning is \u201cof such gravity that the individual <em>has no reasonable alternative </em>but to leave work.\u201d (Emphasis added.) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"686\">*686</page-number>The claimant \u201chas the burden of proving good cause by a preponderance of the evidence.\u201d <em>Kercher v. Employment Dept., </em>250 Or App 409, 411, 280 P3d 1040 (2012). In this case, therefore, the EAB\u2019s evaluation of claimant\u2019s request for unemployment benefits turned on whether she proved that she had no reasonable alternative to leaving WESD on December 1, 2009.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-3\">In its 2010 order, the EAB observed that claimant\u2019s working conditions \u201cwere not ideal [,]\u201d and it quoted from the Secretary of State\u2019s audit report, which described financial problems at WESD. Nonetheless, the EAB decided that claimant had left work without good cause because, although claimant had held a subordinate position and had been expected to accept direction from her superiors, \u201cno one from WESD told claimant she would be discharged or asked to resign\u201d if she did not follow instructions. The crux of the EAB\u2019s reasoning was that even \u201cassuming, <em>arguendo, </em>[that WESD\u2019s] improper financial practices * * * continued\u201d in late 2009, claimant \u201chad the option to continue working and, <em>if asked </em>to do anything improper, refuse.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b710-4\">On review, we held that the EAB\u2019s decision did not follow from its factual findings because those findings did not support a conclusion that, if asked to continue facilitating financial improprieties, claimant reasonably could have refused. <em>Campbell I, </em>245 Or App at 581. That is, we rejected the EAB\u2019s reasoning that, <em>even if </em>claimant were asked to commit improprieties, her purported ability to refuse to follow her superiors\u2019 instructions constituted a reasonable alternative to leaving work.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-5\">On remand for reconsideration, the EAB affirmed the ALJ\u2019s order for a second time, again deciding that claimant had voluntarily left work without good cause and was, therefore, ineligible for unemployment benefits. However, the EAB\u2019s second analysis did not hinge \u2014 as had the analysis in its first order \u2014 on whether claimant had the option of refusing to facilitate any fiscal mismanagement. Instead, the order on reconsideration focused on a factual question that we did not address in <em>Campbell I: </em>whether claimant actually would have been expected to commit \u201cimproper\u201d acts after December 1, 2009 (the day she resigned).</p>\n<p id=\"b711-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"687\">*687</page-number>On that point, the EAB made findings that undercut claimant\u2019s assertion that she had no reasonable alternative to leaving work. Most directly, the EAB found that, <em>\u201cif </em>anyone at WESD was \u2018doing * * * improper things\u2019 by December 1, 2009, it was not claimant.\u201d (Emphasis added.) That finding was echoed in the EAB\u2019s determination that claimant had not proved that she would have been required to perform any improper tasks after December 1. The EAB acknowledged claimant\u2019s testimony that \u201c\u2018the illegal piece\u2019 that was \u2018probably still going on,\u2019 \u2018was the hiring of people on contracts\u2019\u201d that were being prepared and approved \u201cin a manner inconsistent with \u2018IRS rules and policies.\u2019\u201d However, the board noted, claimant did not refute testimony given by the WESD\u2019s new human resources director, who stated that, as of November 1, 2009, the contracting practices that previously might have alarmed the IRS were \u201cnot continuing.\u201d Moreover, the board explained that, although there was evidence that claimant had been asked to participate in improper practices during April and May 2009,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b711-4\">\u201c[b]y November 2009, public scrutiny of the improprieties that concerned claimant was elevated, audits and investigations were well underway, necessary reforms were being planned and implemented, with claimant even being asked to \u2018take a lead\u2019 in their execution.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b711-5\">The EAB thus determined that, \u201c[a]t most, claimant\u2019s evidence establishes that, at the time she resigned, all needed reforms were not completed, and she disagreed strongly with management about the timing and pace of those reforms.\u201d The board then decided that claimant\u2019s disagreement with the pace of change did not result in her having \u201cno alternative but to leave work,\u201d judged by an objective standard. \u201cPut another way,\u201d the board explained,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b711-6\">\u201ca reasonable and prudent Director of Financial Services, of normal sensitivity, exercising ordinary common sense in claimant\u2019s circumstances, would have continued her employment past December 1,2009, at least until she found employment elsewhere that was more to her liking.[<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>] Accordingly, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"688\">*688</page-number>claimant did not have \u2018good cause\u2019 to quit work when she did, and is disqualified from receiving unemployment insurance benefits * * *.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b712-4\">Claimant\u2019s petition for judicial review challenges that determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-5\">Stated broadly, claimant makes two arguments on review: (1) that the EAB\u2019s determination that she did not have good cause for leaving work lacks substantial evidence and reason; and (2) that the EAB\u2019s decision is impermissibly inconsistent with <em>Campbell I. </em>We disagree with both of those contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-6\">We start with claimant\u2019s second argument, in which she asserts that <em>Campbell I </em>held that, \u201cbased upon the facts in the record, [claimant] established \u2018good cause\u2019 to resign.\u201d According to claimant, <em>Campbell I </em>\u201cestablished the law of this case\u201d on that point, and the EAB committed legal error when it \u201cfail[ed] to follow that decision.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b712-7\">As an initial matter, we disagree with claimant\u2019s characterization of <em>Campbell I. </em>As explained above, in that case we held that the EAB\u2019s decision that claimant could simply refuse to undertake any improper tasks that she was asked to perform did not follow from its factual findings that she was in a \u201csubordinate position\u201d and therefore was \u201cexpected\u201d to follow instructions. 245 Or App at 581. As a result, we decided that the EAB\u2019s decision lacked substantial reason. <em>Id. </em>But our determination that the EAB\u2019s reasoning did not support its conclusion that claimant lacked \u201cgood cause\u201d for resigning is not logically equivalent to an affirmative holding that claimant <em>did </em>establish \u201cgood cause\u201d for leaving her job. We held only the former in <em>Campbell I, </em>not the latter.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"689\">*689</page-number>We also disagree with claimant\u2019s assertion that, on reconsideration, the EAB \u201cfail[ed] to rely on any additional facts for its holding\u201d and merely reiterated the conclusion that we rejected in <em>Campbell I. </em>First, although the EAB\u2019s order on reconsideration did adopt the factual findings from its initial order, the EAB also emphasized additional findings, including that claimant did not prove that she was doing any \u201cimproper things\u201d by December 1, 2009, or that she would be required to do any improper things after that date. Those findings are supported by the testimony of WESD\u2019s director of human resources, who indicated that claimant would not have been asked to do anything improper after the beginning of November 2009. Thus, claimant\u2019s analysis fails to the extent that it is premised on a contention that the order on reconsideration is based on the same factual findings as was the original order.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-4\">Moreover, the order on reconsideration is based on a different analysis than the one we rejected when the original order was before us on judicial review. In <em>Campell I, </em>we focused on the EAB\u2019s flawed <em>reasoning, viz., </em>its determination that claimant reasonably could have refused to obey any directions to commit financial improprieties. Notably, neither our opinion in <em>Campbell I </em>nor the EAB\u2019s original order rested on any decision about whether, in fact, claimant would have been asked to continue performing improper acts after December 1, 2009. To the contrary, both decisions assumed, <em>arguendo, </em>that WESD would have made such requests; the dispute was only over what consequences followed from that <em>assumed </em>fact. <em>See, e.g., Campbell I, </em>245 Or App at 580-81 (rejecting the EAB\u2019s conclusion that \u201cclaimant had the option to continue working and, <em>if </em>asked to do anything improper, refuse\u201d (emphasis added)). In its order on reconsideration, the EAB addressed the underlying factual question, and it explicitly found that claimant would <em>not </em>have been required to commit any improprieties after December 1. Because the board\u2019s decision rests on facts and reasoning that we did not address (and had no reason to address) in <em>Campbell I, </em>no \u201claw of the case\u201d principle barred the board from analyzing claimant\u2019s situation the way it did on reconsideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"690\">*690</page-number>The remaining question is whether the EAB\u2019s order on reconsideration is supported by substantial evidence and comports with substantial reason. In that regard, claimant\u2019s primary contention is that the EAB \u201cfailed to consider evidence of continued misconduct[.]\u201d But the order on reconsideration shows that the board did consider such evidence, including claimant\u2019s own testimony. It apparently chose, however, to give more weight to different evidence in the record, including the testimony of WESD\u2019s human resources director, who stated that the contracting practices to which claimant had particularly objected had ceased by November 2009. The EAB also relied on evidence that major changes were underway at that point, and that claimant had been asked to take a lead in the execution of necessary reforms. That evidence adequately supports the EAB\u2019s determination that claimant was not being asked to do anything improper by the time she resigned.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-4\">Claimant also asserts that the EAB \u201cdisregarded the evidence that [claimant] was suffering retaliation and that she had exhausted her avenues of complaining about [WESD\u2019s] misconduct.\u201d We find no indication in the order on reconsideration that the EAB disregarded the evidence to which claimant points, <em>i.e., </em>her removal from management e-mail lists, changes to some of her job duties, and changes to certain modes of communication among claimant and her managers. To the contrary, the EAB noted those circumstances in the findings included in its initial order, which it adopted in the order on reconsideration. The EAB simply determined that those circumstances did not create a situation in which \u201ca reasonable and prudent Director of Financial Services, of normal sensitivity, exercising ordinary common sense in claimant\u2019s circumstances\u201d would have \u201cno alternative but to leave work.\u201d Claimant has not identified any flaw either in that ultimate determination or in the analysis leading to it.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-5\">In the end, claimant asks us to substitute our judgment for the EAB\u2019s on the determinative factual question of whether claimant \u201cwould be \u2018forced to continue doing * * * improper things.\u2019\u201d But our role is not to determine whether we would have reached the same result as the EAB <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"691\">*691</page-number>if we were acting as fact finders. Rather, our review of an administrative agency\u2019s decision is limited to determining whether substantial evidence and reason support the agency\u2019s determination and whether the agency applied the law correctly. <em>See Kercher, </em>250 Or App at 412 (\u201c[o]ur role is not to substitute our judgment for that of the [EAB]\u201d on the question of whether a claimant left work without good cause, \u201cbut rather to determine if the findings of fact are supported by substantial evidence\u201d). Applying that standard of review, we find no basis for disturbing the EAB\u2019s order on reconsideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b707-7\"> Neither the Employment Department nor claimant\u2019s former employer filed a response brief in this court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b709-8\"> At that time, the Secretary of State\u2019s office was reviewing WESD\u2019s financial practices. In 2010 \u2014 after claimant had resigned \u2014 the office produced a report that \u2018\u201cidentified extensive and obvious weaknesses at WESD that would not persist in an organization that is responsibly governed, well managed, and open to concerns raised by staff.\u2019\u201d <em>Campbell I, </em>245 Or App at 577 n 3 (quoting audit report).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b711-7\"> We are troubled by the EAB\u2019s continued reference to the fact that claimant did not obtain other employment before she resigned from WESD. As we have noted repeatedly \u2014 including in our opinion in <em>Campbell </em>I \u2014 an employee is not \u201crequired to seek other work before resigning in order to establish \u2018good cause\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"688\">*688</page-number>under the rule [.] \u201d 245 Or App at 581 n 5. To the contrary, the theory that a j ob search is a prerequisite to establishing \u201cgood cause\u201d for resigning has been \u201csquarely rejected.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Notwithstanding the EAB\u2019s reference to claimant having not \u201cfound employment elsewhere,\u201d reading the order on reconsideration as a whole, we conclude that the EAB did not base its \u201cno good cause\u201d determination on any absence of a job search but rather (as we discuss later in this opinion) on its finding that claimant no longer was being required to engage in improprieties by the time she resigned.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
