Father cross-appeals; he asserts that the amount is too high. Both parties contend that the trial court erred in calculating father\u2019s presumed income.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In addition, mother contends that, even if the trial court did not err in calculating father\u2019s presumed income, it erred in failing to consider father\u2019s other available resources \u2014 specifically, his portion of a $3.3 million lottery prize \u2014 when determining whether the presumed child support obligation based on father\u2019s presumed income was unjust or inappropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-5\">For the reasons explained below, we conclude that the trial court erred in calculating father\u2019s presumed income. Therefore, we remand for the trial court to determine whether the presumed child support obligation based on father\u2019s properly calculated presumed income is unjust or inappropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-6\">To provide necessary context for the parties\u2019 arguments on appeal, we begin by reviewing the statutes and rules that govern how a parent\u2019s child support obligation is to be calculated. ORS 25.275 establishes the statutory criteria for determining the amount of a child support award. ORS 25.275(1) provides, \u201cThe Division of Child Support of the Department of Justice shall establish by rule a formula for determining child support awards in any judicial or administrative proceeding.\u201d The subsection further provides that, \u201c [i] n establishing the formula, the division shall take into consideration\u201d certain criteria, including \u201c [a] 11 earnings, income and resources of each parent,\u201d ORS 25.275(1)(a), and \u201c[t]he earnings history and potential of each parent!,]\u201d ORS 25.275(1)(b). In addition, ORS 25.275(2)(a) provides that the formula must comply with certain policies, including that \u201c[t]he child is entitled to benefit from the income of both parents to the same extent that the child would have benefited had the family unit remained intact or if there had been an intact family unit consisting of both parents and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"715\">*715</page-number>the child.\u201d ORS 25.280 provides that \u201cthe amount of support determined by the formula established under ORS 25.275 is presumed to be the correct amount of the obligation,\u201d but that presumption \u201cis a rebuttable presumption and a written finding or specific finding on the record that the application of the formula would be unjust or inappropriate in a particular case is sufficient to rebut the presumption.\u201d \u201c[C]riteria [that] shall be considered in making the finding\u201d include:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b739-4\">\u201c(1) Evidence of the other available resources of a parent;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b739-5\">\u201c(2) The reasonable necessities of a parent;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b739-6\">\u201c(3) The net income of a parent remaining after with-holdings required by law or as a condition of employment;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b739-7\">\u201c(4) A parent\u2019s ability to borrow;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b739-8\">&gt;j; jfs \u2021</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b739-9\">\u201c(10) The financial advantage afforded a parent\u2019s household by the income of a spouse or another person with whom the parent lives in a relationship similar to husband and wife.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b739-10\">ORS 25.280.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-11\">As directed by ORS 25.275(1), the Division of Child Support (the division) has established a formula for determining child support awards. The formula is set out in the Oregon Child Support Guidelines (the guidelines), OAR 137-050-0700 to 137-050-0765. As relevant here, the formula has three basic steps. OAR 137-050-0710. The first step is to determine the parents\u2019 presumed incomes. OAR 137-050-0710(4), (5); OAR 137-050-0715; OAR 137-050-0720. The second step is to use the parents\u2019 presumed incomes to determine their presumed support obligations. OAR 137-050-0710(6), (7); OAR 137-055-0025. The third step is to determine if the presumed support obligations are unjust or inappropriate. OAR 137-050-0710(15); OAR 137-050-0760. In accordance with ORS 25.280, the guidelines identify several \u201crebuttal factors\u201d relevant to whether a parent\u2019s presumed support obligation is unjust or inappropriate, including \u201c[e]vidence of the other available resources of the parent[.]\u201d OAR 137-050-0760(1)(a). \u201cThe rebuttal factors may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"716\">*716</page-number>be applied by adjusting the income of a parent, the costs for the child or the presumed support amount.\u201d OAR 137-050-0760(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b740-4\">With those statutes and rules in mind, we turn to the facts of this case. In 2002, mother and father divorced, and the trial court ordered father to pay child support in the amount of $1,057 per month and to provide health insurance for the parties\u2019 two children, who were born in 1989 and 1996.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-5\">In 2006, father filed a written request with the division, asking that his child support obligation be reviewed and modified. <em>See </em>ORS 25.287 (providing for periodic reviews of child support obligations and for reviews based on substantial changes in circumstances). The division prepared an administrative order reducing father\u2019s support obligation to $497 per month, and the trial court entered the order.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-6\">Both mother and father remarried. In March 2008, father\u2019s current wife won the Oregon Lottery, claiming a prize of $3.3 million. Father\u2019s wife purchased the winning lottery ticket with marital funds, and she and father shared the winnings. After paying federal and state taxes, they deposited the remaining winnings into joint accounts. They used some of the winnings to buy a house and to make large cash gifts to family and friends. They also used some of the winnings to pay father\u2019s debts, including past due child support and interest on that past due amount.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-7\">Thereafter, father and his wife placed most of the remaining winnings in investment accounts, held in both their names. Their investments, which primarily consist of municipal bonds, generate approximately $40,000 in interest each year. Father and his wife pay their living expenses with that interest, as neither works. Father has been unemployed since 2001 and has been convicted of several felonies. Thus, the trial court found that father was \u201cvirtually unemployable in his former field,\u201d computer network administration.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-8\">In December 2008, the division filed a motion in the Clackamas County Circuit Court to set aside the 2006 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"717\">*717</page-number>administrative order \u2014 which, as noted, had reduced father\u2019s monthly child support obligation from $1,057 to $497 \u2014 on the ground that it was void because it had been entered without knowledge of the 2002 order. ORS 416.415. The trial court granted the motion.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Two months later, in February 2009, mother requested a new child support order and asked that any award be retroactive to the date of her request. She also requested cash medical support beginning that date. Mother\u2019s request related only to the parties\u2019 younger son; their older son was no longer a minor.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-4\">In May 2009, the division issued a Notice and Finding of Financial Responsibility proposing that father pay $277 per month in child support. ORS 416.415(1). Mother objected to the proposed support amount and requested a hearing. ORS 416.415(2)(g)-(h), (6).</p>\n<p id=\"b741-5\">On January 8, 2010, an administrative law judge (ALJ) conducted a hearing, and, on January 25, the ALJ issued an order awarding mother $1,245 per month in child support and $586 per month in cash medical support. Because father was unemployed but benefited from the use of the lottery winnings, the ALJ calculated father\u2019s presumed income as the amount of lottery winnings and investment income therefrom that had been spent on father\u2019s behalf.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b742-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"718\">*718</page-number>After the ALJ\u2019s order, father deeded to his wife his interest in their home and transferred assets from their joint accounts to accounts held only by her. He later testified that he took those actions to protect his assets from \u201ccreditors,\u201d including mother.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-4\">Father appealed the ALJ\u2019s order to the trial court, which conducted a hearing on July 14, 2010. In the trial court, the parties stipulated that mother\u2019s monthly income was $2,194. But, they disagreed about how the court should calculate father\u2019s income. At the beginning of the hearing, mother argued that, because father was unemployed, but employable, the court should attribute an employment income to him, as well as a portion of the lottery winnings. Specifically, mother\u2019s attorney argued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b742-5\">\u201c[Father] is fully capable of working. He chooses not to, and he doesn\u2019t need to, but even the latter, I think that the representations by [father] that his wife won the lottery; therefore, he doesn\u2019t have any income from it is specious and is inconsistent with the facts. It is household income for the two of them. *** [AJssets *** were put in both names until the child support became an issue.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b742-6\">\u201cSo I think the decision of the administrative law judge was appropriate in this case, and I don\u2019t think there is any reason to deviate from that or to go below with regard to [father\u2019s] income.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b742-7\">Mother\u2019s attorney further argued that, to determine the amount of lottery winnings to include in father\u2019s income, the court should rely on the amount of winnings that had been spent on father\u2019s behalf, as the ALJ did. Mother\u2019s attorney suggested the following calculation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b742-8\">\u201c[Look at] what he spent in 2009. That is after all the initial gifts to friends and relatives were made, after they had some time to settle down, as far as that is concerned. They still spent $387,000. I think that is the appropriate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"719\">*719</page-number>figure, plus the appropriate amount, percentage of tax on those net proceeds.[<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b743-4\">\u201cTake that figure and divide it by two, and I think that is the appropriate amount for [father], because these lottery winnings *** are their joint marital income for both of them. Therefore, I think it is reasonable to take that amount, plus the appropriate amount of taxes that go with it, divide it by two, to reach his income and cash medical support ***[.]\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b743-5\">Father responded that the only income that the trial court should attribute to him was either the amount he would earn if he worked a full-time minimum-wage job or one-half of the $40,000 in interest that he and his wife earned on the invested lottery winnings. His attorney argued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b743-6\">\u201cThe core issue is that [father], who lost any earned income in 2000 when he worked in the computer field, subsequently ran into some hard times, was convicted of a series of felonies and now does not have current qualifications. And by virtue of his outdated qualifications, his not having worked in ten years and his criminal felony convictions, he is simply not employable. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b743-7\">\u201cTo the extent that\u2019s true, he can be attributed a minimum wage at 40 hours a week[.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b743-8\">\u201c* * * [H]is wife did win the lottery in 2008. We will show how those funds were allocated and that they generate about $40,000 a year as income for [father\u2019s wife]. If this Court finds that the income from those lottery winnings, from [his wife\u2019s] lottery earnings should be attributed to father, then half of that income is about $20,000 a year. It is about the same amount that would be attributed to him under the OARs as his potential income [from a full-time, minimum-wage job].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b743-9\">\u201cSo in either case \u2014 and the OARs are clear: That\u2019s an either/or analysis. You either attribute to him the minimum wage earnings, or if you call his wife\u2019s \u2014 the dividends from his lottery winnings earnings, then those substitute for his potential earnings, and that number is about $20,000 a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"720\">*720</page-number>year ***[.] So under either analysis, [father\u2019s] income ends up being about $20,000 a year.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b744-4\">After taking the matter under advisement, the trial court issued a letter opinion, in which it calculated father\u2019s presumed income by adding (1) the amount father would earn annually if he worked a full-time minimum-wage job and (2) one-half of the annual interest father and his wife earned on the lottery winnings that they invested in municipal bonds. The court did not include any of the lottery principal in father\u2019s income. The court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b744-5\">\u201cThe lottery winnings are no longer considered income because [father] obtained those funds in 2008. [Mother] argues that any lottery winnings withdrawn from [father and his wife\u2019s] accounts for [father\u2019s] benefit constitute a gift at the time of the withdrawal and must be included as income when determining child support.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b744-6\">\u201cBased on the information presented, I conclude that [father\u2019s] use of the lottery winnings is not considered income when determining [father\u2019s] child support obligations. [Father] received that money outside of the period of time relevant for current child support calculations. The winnings could have been a gift when they were originally placed into the joint account, but [father\u2019s] ongoing use of that money cannot be seen as a continuing gift that accrues every time he withdraws funds.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b744-7\">Based on its calculation of father\u2019s presumed income and its determination that there was no reason to rebut the presumed support amount, the court awarded mother $476 per month in child support and $125 per month in cash medical support.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-8\">On appeal, mother asks us to review the trial court\u2019s decision <em>de novo </em>pursuant to ORS 19.415 (3) (b) and urges us to reinstate the ALJ\u2019s award. She makes two alternative arguments. First, she argues that the trial court erred in calculating father\u2019s presumed income. According to mother, the trial court should have calculated father\u2019s presumed income based on the lottery funds spent on his behalf, as the ALJ did. Second, she argues that, even if the trial court correctly calculated father\u2019s presumed income, we should consider the following facts as rebuttal factors under ORS 25.280(1): father\u2019s access to lottery winnings, his history <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"721\">*721</page-number>of child support arrearages, and his admission to the trial court that he moved assets to avoid paying child support obligations.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-4\">Father cross-appeals, arguing that the trial court erred when it added his actual and potential income to calculate his presumed income. According to father, the statute permits a court to use one figure or the other, but not both.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-5\">We decline mother\u2019s invitation to review the trial court\u2019s decision <em>de novo </em>and instead review for legal error. <em>Nice v. Townley, </em>248 Or App 616, 618, 274 P3d 227 (2012); ORAP 5.40(8)(c) (\u201cThe Court of Appeals will exercise its discretion to try the cause anew on the record or to make one or more factual findings anew on the record only in exceptional cases.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b745-6\">We first address whether the trial court correctly calculated father\u2019s presumed income under the guidelines. We review the trial court\u2019s interpretation of the guidelines for legal error. <em>Malpass and Malpass, </em>255 Or App 233, 234, 296 P3d 653 (2013); <em>Bock and Bock, </em>249 Or App 241, 242, 275 P3d 1006 (2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b745-7\">The guidelines define \u201cincome\u201d; they also distinguish between \u201cactual income\u201d and \u201cpotential income\u201d and specify when a parent\u2019s income is presumed to be the parent\u2019s \u201cactual income\u201d and when it is presumed to be the parent\u2019s \u201cpotential income.\u201d Specifically, OAR 137-050-0715 provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b745-8\">\u201c(1) <em>\u2018Income\u2019 means the actual or potential gross income of a parent, as determined in this rule.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b745-9\">\u201c(2) <em>\u2018Actual income\u2019 </em>means all earnings and income from any source, except as provided in section (4).

Father argues that, as defined by OAR 137-050-0715(1), a parent\u2019s income must therefore be <em>either </em>the parent\u2019s actual income <em>or </em>the parent\u2019s potential income; according to father, it cannot be a combination of the two.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-9\">When interpreting a rule, we begin by examining its text and context. <em>State v. Gaines, </em>346 Or 160, 171, 206 P3d 1042 (2009); <em>In re Marriage of Perlenfein and Perlenfein, </em>316 Or 16, 20, 848 P2d 604 (1993). The relevant text is the definition of \u201cincome\u201d and, in particular, the definition\u2019s use of the term \u201cor.\u201d As the Supreme Court recently explained, \u201cor,\u201d while always disjunctive, may have \u201ceither an \u2018inclusive\u2019 or an \u2018exclusive\u2019 sense. Thus, \u2018A or B\u2019 can mean one or the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"724\">*724</page-number>other, but not both. But it can also mean one or the other, or both.\u201d <em>Burke v. DLCD, </em>352 Or 428, 435-36, 290 P3d 790 (2012). Whether the disjunctive \u201cor\u201d is inclusive or exclusive depends on context. <em>Id. </em>at 437.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b748-4\">\u201cIf, for example, a person is told, \u2018If you obtain a passport, you may travel to England, France, or Germany,\u2019 that does not necessarily mean that he or she may travel to only one of those destinations. Or, * * * if a person is asked whether she wishes \u2018cream or sugar\u2019 with her coffee, the request does not necessarily exclude the possibility of having both.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b748-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 436 (citing Bryan A. Garner, <em>Modern American Usage </em>45 (2003)).</p>\n<p id=\"b748-6\">Here, the structure of OAR 137-050-0715, which prescribes how to calculate a parent\u2019s income for purposes of child support, persuades us that the \u201cor\u201d in OAR 137-050-0715(1) is exclusive. As set out above, under OAR 137-050-0715(6), a parent\u2019s income is <em>presumed to be his or her potential income </em>if the parent is unemployed, is employed on a less-than-full-time basis, has an income that is less than Oregon minimum wage for full-time employment, or lacks direct evidence of any income. Under OAR 137-050-0715(7), a parent\u2019s income is <em>presumed to be his or her actual income </em>if the parent is working full-time at or above the state minimum wage, is unable to work full-time due to a verified disability, is receiving workers\u2019 compensation benefits, or is incarcerated as defined in OAR 137-055-3300. Essentially, a parent\u2019s income is presumed to be the parent\u2019s potential income when the parent is capable of working full-time for at least minimum wage, but is not doing so, and a parent\u2019s income is presumed to be the parent\u2019s actual income in all other situations. Thus, OAR 137-050-0715 establishes a system within which a parent\u2019s presumed income is <em>either </em>the parent\u2019s actual income <em>or </em>the parent\u2019s potential income, not a combination of the two. In other words, when the guidelines define \u201cincome\u201d as \u201cthe actual <em>or </em>potential gross income of a parent,\u201d OAR 137-050-0715(1) (emphasis added), the \u201cor\u201d is exclusive, not inclusive.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-7\">Admittedly, in cases like this one, OAR 137-050-0715\u2019s binary approach may result in \u201cincome\u201d determinations that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"725\">*725</page-number>do not accurately reflect the financial resources actually received by a parent. When a parent\u2019s income is presumed to be the parent\u2019s potential income, it is limited, by the definition of potential income, to either the parent\u2019s \u201cprobable full-time earnings\u201d or the \u201camount of income [the] parent could earn working full-time at the current state minimum wage.\u201d OAR 137-050-0715(5). Thus, it does not include any financial resources that the parent actually receives in the form of, for example, bonuses, returns on capital, gifts, prizes, or rents, all of which are included in the presumed incomes of parents who work full-time at or above the minimum wage, as well as parents receiving workers\u2019 compensation benefits, parents who are incarcerated, and parents who are unable to work full-time due to a verified disability. OAR 137-050-0715(2), (7). However, as discussed below, those inaccuracies may be corrected through application of the rebuttal factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-4\">In this case, the trial court erred when it calculated father\u2019s presumed income based on both his actual income (from the interest earned on the invested lottery winnings) and his potential income (from a full-time, minimum-wage job). Because father was unemployed, his presumed income was his potential income. OAR 137-050-0715(6). Because, as the trial court found, father could no longer work as a network administrator, and there was no evidence that he could earn above the state minimum wage, his potential income was the amount that he could earn working full-time at a minimum-wage job. ORS 137-050-0715(5).</p>\n<p id=\"b749-5\">Thus, the trial court should have concluded that father\u2019s presumed income was what he could earn working full-time at minimum wage. If the court had done so, its next step would have been to determine whether the presumed child support obligation based on full-time, minimum-wage earnings would be unjust or inappropriate. OAR 137-050-0760(1); <em>see also </em>ORS 25.275; ORS 25.280. As mentioned, the guidelines identify several rebuttal factors relevant to whether a parent\u2019s presumed support obligation is unjust or inappropriate, including \u201c[e]vidence of the other available resources of the parent[.]\u201d OAR 137-050-0760(1)(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b750-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"726\">*726</page-number>We remand because the trial court did not determine whether a child support obligation based on full-time, minimum-wage earnings would be unjust or inappropriate. Because they are likely to arise on remand, we address two additional issues. <em>See Cain and Gilbert, </em>196 Or App 28, 32, 100 P3d 735 (2004) (addressing issues likely to arise on remand in a custody and child support case).</p>\n<p id=\"b750-4\">First, father\u2019s lottery winnings may be considered \u201cother available resources\u201d for the purposes of determining whether his presumed support obligation is unjust or inappropriate. OAR 137-050-0760(1)(a). The lottery winnings, or lottery principal, was income to father and his wife in 2008. No one would dispute that, if father had been employed in a position in 2008 that paid $3.3 million, that earned income would have been considered actual income for purposes of calculating child support. <em>See </em>OAR 137-050-0715(2)(a) (Actual income includes \u201c[e]mployment-related income including salaries, wages, commissions, advances, bonuses, dividends, severance pay, pensions, and honoraria[.]\u201d). Moreover, if father had held a full-time job when his wife won the lottery, his presumed income would have been his \u201cactual income,\u201d as defined by OAR 137-050-0715(2), and would have included the lottery winnings. OAR 137-050-0715(2)(d) (lottery winnings are part of actual income). It would be inappropriate if, simply because father was unemployed when his wife won the lottery, none of that money were characterized as father\u2019s resources. It would also contravene the statutory directives that child support obligations should reflect \u201c [a]ll earnings, income and resources of each parent,\u201d ORS 25.275(1)(a), and that a child \u201cis entitled to benefit from the income of both parents to the same extent that the child would have benefited had the family unit remained intact or if there had been an intact family unit consisting of both parents and the child,\u201d ORS 25.275(2)(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b750-5\">Furthermore, the lottery winnings may be considered \u201cother available resources of the parent\u201d under OAR 137~050-0760(1)(a) even though mother\u2019s request for a new child support order came 11 months after father and wife won the lottery. To hold otherwise would create an incentive for parents to spend, transfer, or hide lump <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"727\">*727</page-number>sums quickly in order to reduce their child support obligations. Such a perverse incentive would frustrate the statutory directives expressed in ORS 25.275(1)(a) and ORS 25.275(2)(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b751-4\">Moreover, a parent requesting child support or a modification of child support will virtually always discover a change in the obligor parent\u2019s financial circumstances <em>after </em>that change has occurred. The guidelines include \u201c[g]ifts and prizes, including lottery winnings\u201d in actual income, thus evidencing an intent to include all monetary resources \u2014 even one-time, unanticipated windfalls \u2014 in child support determinations. OAR 137-050-0715(2)(d). A request for support or a modification of support based on such resources will necessarily come after the resources have been received. When, as here, the parents are divorced and unable to agree on the amount of child support, the obligor parent is less likely to disclose facts that would cause that parent\u2019s support obligations to increase. That further increases the amount of time that is likely to transpire before the obligee parent discovers a beneficial change in the obligor parent\u2019s financial circumstances. There is uncontested evidence that mother requested a new child support order within two months of learning that the 2006 order had been set aside. Against that backdrop, mother did not unreasonably or improperly delay in seeking a support order. Therefore, the lottery winnings may be considered \u201cother available resources\u201d for the purpose of determining whether the presumed child support obligation is unjust or inappropriate. OAR 137-050-0760(1)(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b751-5\">Second, the interest on the lottery winnings may also be considered \u201cother available resources of the parent.\u201d OAR 137-050-0760(1)(a). As the trial court implicitly recognized, the interest earned on the lottery winnings is income for father and his wife. They receive approximately $40,000 in interest annually, which they use to pay their living expenses. If father were employed full-time at or above the minimum wage, his child support obligation would be based on his actual income, which would include both his wages and the interest on the lottery winnings. OAR 137-050-0715 (7) (a). There is no reason why father\u2019s half of the interest <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"728\">*728</page-number>may not be considered a rebuttal factor when calculating his child support obligation.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-4\">To summarize, we hold that the trial court erred in calculating father\u2019s presumed income, and we remand for the trial court to determine whether father\u2019s presumed support obligation based on that income is unjust or inappropriate in light of the rebuttal factors, including father\u2019s substantial monetary resources in the form of both the lottery winnings and the interest earned on those winnings. If the court concludes that the presumed support obligation is unjust or inappropriate, it may \u201cadjust [] the income of a parent, the costs for the child [,] or the presumed support amount.\u201d OAR 137-050-0760(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b752-5\">On appeal and cross-appeal, reversed and remanded for recalculation of father\u2019s income, child support obligation, and cash medical support obligation consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b738-7\"> Throughout this opinion, we use the term \u201cpresumed income\u201d to refer to a parent\u2019s actual or potential income, as calculated according to OAK 137-050-0715.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b741-6\"> It is unclear why the division filed the motion to set aside the 2006 order. The affidavit in support of the motion states,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b741-7\">\u201cAn administrative order establishing support between the parties and accompanying child support award and money award were filed with the court on 11/28/2006 without knowledge of the prior Stipulated Judgment of Dissolution of Marriage.

Mother testified that she believed that father\u2019s obligation had been erroneously terminated after father paid the past due child support with the lottery winnings and she executed a satisfaction of judgment for the past due amount.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b741-10\"> The ALJ determined the amount of lottery winnings that had been spent for father\u2019s benefit by adding (1) the amount of the winnings spent on father\u2019s individual expenses (specifically, his debts) and (2) one-half of the winnings spent on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"718\">*718</page-number>father\u2019s shared expenses (including gifts made to his family, travel expenses, and property taxes).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b743-10\"> Mother\u2019s position, was that father\u2019s income should include \u201ca portion of the taxes that were paid\u201d on the lottery winnings because \u201cthe guidelines do not go off after tax income.
