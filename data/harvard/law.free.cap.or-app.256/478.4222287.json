ORS 164.045. On appeal, he asserts that the trial court erred in denying his motion for judgment of acquittal and in imposing $87.33 of restitution, a $67 unitary assessment, a $35 surcharge, and $390 in attorney fees. We reject without published discussion all of defendant\u2019s contentions except for his argument that the trial court erred in imposing attorney fees. With respect to that assertion, the state concedes that \u201cthe trial court erred by imposing $390 in attorney\u2019s fees in the judgment when the record does not support defendant\u2019s ability to pay those fees.\u201d We agree and accept the state\u2019s concession. <em>See State v. Pendergrapht, </em>251 Or App 630, 284 P3d 573 (2012) (holding that it is error to impose attorney fees where the record does not support the defendant\u2019s ability to pay those fees).</p>\n<p id=\"b503-5\">Attorney fee assessment reversed; otherwise affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
