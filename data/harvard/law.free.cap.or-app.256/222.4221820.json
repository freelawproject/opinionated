On appeal, defendant contends that, because the state failed to lay a scientific foundation for evidence involving the precise rate of dissipation of alcohol, the trial court erred in denying his motion to exclude that proffered scientific evidence. As explained below, defendant\u2019s arguments to the trial court regarding expert testimony were qualitatively different than the argument that he advances on appeal and, accordingly, that argument is not preserved for our review. Defendant also contends that the trial court erred in denying his motion for judgment of acquittal because there was insufficient evidence that he had actually driven while under the influence of intoxicants, as required by ORS 813.010. We conclude that there was sufficient circumstantial evidence in the record that defendant in fact drove, and, thus, the trial court did not err in denying defendant\u2019s motion for judgment of acquittal. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-5\">One morning, at 5:30 a.m., Trooper Johnson received a call from dispatch reporting that a truck was parked off the side of a highway. Johnson arrived at the truck\u2019s location at 6:40 a.m., and Sergeant Williams, coming to assist Johnson, arrived there at the same time. Johnson and Williams observed tire tracks in a sandy gravel area off the highway that extended into a barrow pit and the sagebrush where defendant\u2019s truck was parked. Defendant appeared to be asleep in the driver\u2019s seat and there was \u201c[no] indication * * * that anybody else had been there and left.\u201d There was a six-pack of 12-ounce beer cans in the console area, two of which were open and empty. The officers, one on each side of the truck, \u201cpounded on the windows,\u201d and, after a minute, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>defendant woke up and got out of the truck to speak with the officers.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-4\">Defendant appeared to be disoriented and smelled of alcohol. When asked why he was parked off the highway, defendant explained that he had \u201cgot [ten] lost and took a wrong turn as he was going to his ranch in Alfalfa,\u201d which was about 60 miles from where defendant was parked. Defendant explained that, earlier that day, he was unable to sleep, so he \u201cdecided to take a Xanax\u201d and then drive to his ranch. Defendant initially denied consuming any alcohol, but later admitted to drinking one beer and taking some antidepressant medication. In view of those circumstances, Johnson asked defendant to perform field sobriety tests (FSTs). Defendant agreed, and Johnson administered the horizontal gaze nystagmus (HGN) test, the walk-and-turn test, and the one-leg-stand test.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-5\">Johnson first administered the HGN test. He observed \u201ca lack of smooth pursuit\u201d in defendant\u2019s eyes in following the stimulus. However, Johnson could not determine \u201cwhether there was any nystagmus at maximum deviation,\u201d because defendant \u201cwasn\u2019t following the stimulus properly.\u201d Johnson next administered the walk-and-turn test, which defendant chose to perform with his boots off. During the test, he \u201cmissed heel-to-toe, he stopped walking, he used his arms for balance, and he didn\u2019t walk in a straight line.\u201d Defendant took 10 steps instead of the nine steps that he was directed to take, and he turned the wrong way. Defendant failed that test. Finally, Johnson directed defendant to perform the one-leg-stand test. Defendant \u201cused his arms for balance, he put his foot down three times, and he was swaying throughout the test.\u201d Accordingly, defendant also failed that test. In addition to those FSTs, Johnson had defendant estimate the passage of 30 seconds to gauge defendant\u2019s internal clock. Defendant\u2019s estimate was four seconds off, which is acceptable in the drug recognition expert (DRE) context.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-6\">Based on all of those circumstances, Johnson concluded that defendant was under the influence of an intoxicant. After advising defendant of his rights, Johnson placed defendant under arrest and searched his truck. Johnson <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>found a receipt indicating that defendant had purchased a six-pack of beer earlier that morning at 2:19 a.m. at a 7-Eleven located several miles away from defendant\u2019s location on the highway. Johnson then transported defendant to the jail, and defendant gave two breath samples reflecting a 0.07 blood alcohol content (BAC), slightly below the legal limit. Those readings were obtained about three hours after dispatch notified the officers that defendant\u2019s truck was parked off the highway.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-4\">Defendant was subsequently charged with, among other things, driving under the influence of intoxicants and criminal driving while suspended or revoked. Before trial, the state indicated that it intended to offer a DRE officer\u2019s testimony regarding the dissipation rate of alcohol. Defense counsel moved to exclude that testimony, arguing,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b249-5\">\u201cI believe that dissipation rate is actually a scientific method, and I would base my objection on <em>State v. O\u2019Key, </em>[321 Or 285, 899 P2d 663 (1995)]; and <em>Daubert </em>[v. <em>Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc., </em>509 US 579, 113 S Ct 2786, 125 L Ed 2d 469 (1993)].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b249-6\">\u201c[T]he dissipation rate is a scientific method. It\u2019s based on several factors * * * [and] if the [DRE officer] * * * does not have direct training on the metabolic rate, dissipation, the different factors that go into play, it would be unfair to allow him to testify to dissipation rate because he could say anything he wants.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b249-7\">The state responded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b249-8\">\u201cOur issue is that we had the criminalist. We had subpoenaed the criminalist for the earlier trial, and based on the representations of the [d]efense we were told we don\u2019t need him. So that puts us in a difficult position. Now all we have is the trooper.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b249-9\">\u00ab\u2021 \u2021 \u2021</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b249-10\">\u201cSo now we\u2019re at a disadvantage, having relied on the statements that we don\u2019t need to call the criminalist. * * * [Defense counsel\u2019s] objection is not that it doesn\u2019t meet <em>O\u2019Key, </em>his objection is this witness is not qualified to give a representation of that.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b250-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>Although the state initially had no expert available, on the day of trial Jennifer Bray, a forensic scientist, was available to testify on the state\u2019s behalf. Defense counsel asked the court to determine, outside the presence of the jury, \u201cwhat she\u2019s qualified in and what she\u2019s going to testify to,\u201d before testifying before the jury. The parties agreed that it was appropriate to lay an \u201cexpert [ ] foundation\u201d to determine \u201cwhether or not she\u2019s qualified to testify.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b250-4\">Bray first testified about her qualifications as a forensic scientist. She explained that her training involved controlled substances, blood-alcohol analysis, urine toxicology, and breath testing and that, within the blood-alcohol and breath training modules, her training included, among other things, the use of retrograde extrapolation, a method of calculating the range of a driver\u2019s BAC at the time alleged, and Widmark\u2019s formula, a method of calculating the number of drinks consumed to reach a certain BAC. Bray testified that the average rate of dissipation of alcohol is 0.018 percent per hour. However, she explained that she uses a range of 0.01 to 0.02 percent per hour to account for an individual with a slower elimination rate. Thus, she explained, retrograde extrapolation provides a range or \u201cestimation\u201d of BAC at the time alleged, rather than an exact, specific number. Further, Bray explained that, in order to provide that range, she would need to know the time of the driver\u2019s breath test, the time that the driver was stopped, and that the driver was \u201cpost-peak,\u201d meaning that the driver had \u201cabsorbed all of the alcohol\u201d by the time alleged.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-5\">Defense counsel moved to exclude Bray\u2019s testimony, arguing that it would be misleading to the jury. Defense counsel explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b250-6\">\u201c[fit\u2019s the point that I\u2019ve been making; it\u2019s the <em>Daubert </em>and <em>O\u2019Key, </em>and specifically relying on <em>Daubert, </em>it\u2019s in regards to the post-testimony and the sufficiency of that testimony has to be tied to the facts of the case. And here, she\u2019s not going to have sufficient facts that are properly tied to this case to be able to render any kind of reliable decision. So our position is we would rely on <em>O\u2019Key, </em>we would rely on <em>Daubert. </em>We would say that it would be misleading to the jury.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b251-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>The trial court denied defendant\u2019s motion to exclude Bray\u2019s testimony, concluding that, assuming that the specific facts of defendant\u2019s case were provided to Bray, she should \u201cat least have the opportunity\u201d to testify as to retrograde extrapolation as it applied to defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-4\">Bray, testified that, using the method of retrograde extrapolation, she estimated that at 5:30 a.m., defendant\u2019s BAC was between 0.10 and 0.13 percent. Bray also testified that, based on the Widmark formula, if a male of defendant\u2019s height and weight drank two 12-ounce cans of beer, he would reach a theoretical maximum BAC of 0.035 percent. Within three hours, Bray testified, using a conservative range of 0.01 to 0.02 percent dissipation rate, his BAC would be \u201cvery close to zero.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b251-5\">On appeal, defendant first contends that the trial court erred in admitting the retrograde extrapolation evidence. More precisely, defendant now argues that, because the theory of retrograde extrapolation is based on principles of science, and the state failed to meet the enhanced foundational requirements for \u201cscientific\u201d evidence announced in <em>State v. Brown, </em>297 Or 404, 687 P2d 751 (1984), and <em>O\u2019Key, </em>321 Or 285, the trial court should have excluded that evidence. The Supreme Court in <em>O\u2019Key </em>held, among other things, that, \u201cin the absence of a clear case, a case for judicial notice, or a case of <em>prima facie </em>legislative recognition,\u201d the proponent of \u201cscientific\u201d evidence must demonstrate that the evidence is scientifically valid. 321 Or at 293. Defendant contends that, because the proffered scientific evidence here is not the subject of a clear case, a case for judicial notice, or a case of <em>prima facie </em>legislative recognition, the state was required to satisfy the enhanced foundational requirements for scientific evidence, including analysis of the seven factors identified by the Supreme Court in <em>Brown: </em>(1) the technique\u2019s general acceptance in the field; (2) the expert\u2019s qualifications and stature; (3) the use which has been made of the technique; (4) the potential rate of error; (5) the existence of specialized literature; (6) the novelty of the invention; and (7) the extent to which the technique relies on the subjective interpretation of the expert.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>That argument is not preserved.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> As explained above, defendant\u2019s trial objection as to the retrograde extrapolation testimony related to two issues: first, that an expert on retrograde extrapolation, and not a DRE officer, should testify regarding the method and, second, that despite the state procuring an expert, that expert\u2019s testimony would be misleading to the jury because she would \u201cnot * * * have sufficient facts that are properly tied to this case to be able to render any kind of reliable decision.\u201d Thus, defendant\u2019s arguments at trial related to Bray\u2019s qualifications and whether she had sufficient facts to make reliable calculations. By contrast, on appeal, defendant\u2019s challenges are directed at the method of retrograde extrapolation itself, arguing that the state failed to present sufficient evidence that retrograde extrapolation is based on scientifically valid principles. Defendant argues that the state \u201csatisfied not even one of the seven criteria set forth in Brownfor example, Bray \u201coffered no indication of the breadth of the methodology\u2019s acceptance in the field,\u201d she \u201cmade no claim of having researched, written, or published on the subject of retrograde extrapolation,\u201d and the state \u201coffered no specialized literature in support of the proffered scientific methodology.\u201d Those arguments are qualitatively different than the contentions that defendant advanced below. Accordingly, that matter is not preserved for our review as required by ORAP 5.45(1), and we do not consider it. <em>See State v. Wyatt, </em>331 Or 335, 341, 15 P3d 22 (2000) (the court generally will not consider an unpreserved argument on appeal).</p>\n<p id=\"b252-4\">Defendant also contends that the trial court erred in denying his motion for judgment of acquittal because there was insufficient evidence that he had actually <em>driven </em>while under the influence of intoxicants, as required by ORS 813.010. In reviewing the denial of a motion for judgment of acquittal, we view the facts in the light most favorable to the state to determine whether a rational trier of fact could have found the elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>State v. Whitley, </em>295 Or 455, 460, 666 P2d 1340 (1983). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>When analyzing the sufficiency of evidence, \u201cwe make no distinction between direct and circumstantial evidence as to the degree of proof required.\u201d <em>State v. Hall, </em>327 Or 568, 570, 966 P2d 208 (1998). Our review of the record indicates that the trial court did not err in denying defendant\u2019s motion for judgment of acquittal.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-4\">Again, ORS 813.010(1) defines the crime of DUII and provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b253-5\">\u201c(1) A person commits the offense of driving while under the influence of intoxicants if the person drives a vehicle while the person:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b253-6\">\u201c(a) Has 0.08 percent or more by weight of alcohol in the blood of the person as shown by chemical analysis of the breath or blood of the person made under ORS 813.100, 813.140 or 813.150;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b253-7\">\u201c(b) Is under the influence of intoxicating liquor, a controlled substance or an inhalant [.]\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b253-8\">Here, there was sufficient circumstantial evidence for a rational trier of fact to infer that defendant drove while under the influence of an intoxicant or with a BAC of 0.08 percent or more. The state presented evidence that the officers found defendant by himself, sleeping in the driver\u2019s seat of his truck off the side of the highway, that defendant was several miles away from his home, that defendant stated that he \u201cwas driving to his ranch in Alfalfa,\u201d that a few hours earlier defendant had purchased a 6-pack of beer near his home, and that the console of his truck contained the 6-pack with two empty cans of beer. That constitutes legally sufficient evidence from which the jury could have found beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant drove while under the influence of an intoxicant. <em>See State v. Stothoff, </em>99 Or App 197, 199-200, 781 P2d 412 (1989), <em>rev den, </em>309 Or 334 (1990), (evidence that officers found the defendant intoxicated, several miles from his home, with his keys in the ignition, and with two empty bottles of beer was sufficient to sustain denial of motion for judgment acquittal on the issue of driving).</p>\n<p id=\"b253-9\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b247-6\"> ORS 813.010(1) provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b247-7\">\u201c(1) A person commits the offense of driving while under the influence of intoxicants if the person drives a vehicle while the person:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b247-8\">\u201c(a) Has 0.08 percent or more by weight of alcohol in the blood of the person as shown by chemical analysis of the breath or blood of the person made under ORS 813.100, 813.140 or 813.150;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b247-9\">\u201c(b) Is under the influence of intoxicating liquor, a controlled substance or an inhalant[.]\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b252-5\"> The state does not contend that defendant failed to preserve that argument.
