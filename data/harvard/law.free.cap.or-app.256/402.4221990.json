ORS 197.825(1). This case concerns whether LUBA properly dismissed its review of a land use compatibility statement (LUCS) issued by Yamhill County certifying that a proposed state agency permit to construct a landfill berm was compatible with county land use laws. Petitioners sought a determination from LUBA that the county erred in making the compatibility determination in that LUCS. However, LUBA concluded that it lacked jurisdiction to grant petitioners\u2019 requested relief because the LUCS was not a \u201cland use decision\u201d as defined by ORS 197.015(10).</p>\n<p id=\"b428-5\">We review LUBA orders to determine, among other things, whether they are \u201cunlawful in substance.\u201d ORS 197.850(9)(a). On judicial review, petitioners claim that the LUBA dismissal order was unlawful in substance because the LUCS was a \u201cland use decision\u201d and LUBA therefore had review authority. We conclude that LUBA correctly decided that the LUCS was not a \u201cland use decision\u201d under ORS 197.015(10)(b)(H), which sets out exclusions from the definition of that term. Accordingly, we affirm LUBA\u2019s opinion and order.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-6\">We take the facts from LUBA\u2019s opinion and order and the local government record and begin with a description of the county\u2019s LUCS certification and its historical context. Respondent Riverbend Landfill Company, Inc., owns property near the South Yamhill River in Yamhill County that is used as a solid waste disposal facility (\u201clandfill\u201d).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In 1980, the county approved changes to its comprehensive plan and zoning map to designate and rezone that property as \u201cPublic Works Safety\u201d (PWS). Those actions were necessary to allow the development of a \u201csanitary landfill\u201d on the property, a permitted use in the PWS zoning district. The comprehensive plan amendment included an \u201cexceptions statement\u201d that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>justified the failure to apply the requirements of statewide planning Goals 3 (agricultural lands) and 4 (forest lands) to the plan-change for the proposed landfill facility. <em>See </em>OAR 660-015-0000(3), (4).The exceptions statement justified a proposed nonresource use of the property for a landfill based on the need for, and lack of alternatives to, the proposed facility, as well as the consequences and compatibility of its operations.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The proposed use was described as a \u201clandfill\u201d that \u201cwill include a berm to prevent leaching of the Yamhill River.\u201d At the same time, the county issued a conditional use permit for the deposit of fill on the part of the property located in the river\u2019s floodplain. That permit imposed conditions upon the engineering and construction of the proposed landfill. Respondent obtained a solid waste disposal permit for the facility from the Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ) in 1981 and, shortly afterward, constructed the berm and initial disposal cells of the landfill.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-4\">In December 1982, after the landfill began operations, the county adopted a new Yamhill County Zoning Ordinance (YCZO) that included site design review regulations (provisions for review and approval of preliminary and final site development plans). YCZO 1101.01 provided that the \u201csite design review process is intended to guide future growth and development\u201d and that the process applied\u201cto all development in * * * [the] Public Facilities Districts,\u201d including the PWS district.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>In 1990, respondent sought DEQ approval to renew the 1981 solid waste disposal permit. As part of the permit renewal, respondent proposed to expand the landfill area on the rezoned property to include new disposal cells and to construct a new leachate holding lagoon as part of the storm-water management of the landfill. DEQ asked the county for a LUCS \u2014 a determination of whether the uses and activities allowed by the proposed permit were compatible with the county\u2019s comprehensive land use plan and regulations.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b430-4\">In 1992, the county board of commissioners adopted an order authorizing a LUCS for the permit renewal. The order determined that the landfill use, including its expansion, was authorized by the earlier plan change and rezoning and did not need further land use approvals from the county. However, the order concluded that the leachate holding facility was an accessory use to the landfill and required site design review as a new facility. The order provided that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b430-5\">\u201c[n]ew required accessory uses such as a new leachate storage lagoon or new holding tanks, would be permitted uses (as accessory to a sanitary landfill). However, because those uses would be facilities, establishment of the uses would be subject to site design review under the 1982 ordinance. The County draws a distinction between the primary landfill cell development which was contemplated in the original application and the development of modified <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>or new facilities proposed or required as accessory uses to landfill operations.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b431-4\">\u201cThe continued development of solid waste disposal cells contemplated in the original approval of the rezone and comprehensive plan amendment remains an outright permitted use. No land use approvals made by the County imposed restrictions on the lateral or vertical development of the Landfill within the PWS zone. Issues relative to the engineering or environmental safety or appropriateness of landfill design and operation were left to be addressed by DEQ in its review of the Landfill\u2019s operating permit.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b431-5\">Thus, the board concluded, and the LUCS provided, that the permit renewal was \u201ccompatible with Yamhill County\u2019s comprehensive plan and land use regulations, subject to site design review requirements for new facilities\u201d for the leachate lagoon.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-6\">In 2012, respondent applied to DEQ for a modification of that solid waste disposal permit to allow replacement of the earthen berm along the western boundary of the landfill with a \u201cmechanically stabilized earthen\u201d (MSE) berm, as well as construction or modification of new facilities (a recycling facility, scales, a maintenance facility, and leachate storage tanks). The proposed MSE berm is a reinforced berm that is approximately 40 feet in height and taller than the existing berm so that a greater amount of waste can be contained in the adjacent disposal cells.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-7\">DEQ, in turn, asked the county for a LUCS for those changes. The county issued a LUCS for the MSE berm, concluding in its findings that the \u201cMSE berm is a technical change only to the manner in which [respondent] constructs the perimeter berm of the landfill\u201d and that it \u201ccontinues the same use that was authorized in 1980 \u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Petitioners <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>disagreed with the county\u2019s determination and appealed the order to LUBA.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-4\">Before LUBA, respondent moved to dismiss the appeal, contending that the LUCS decision fell within one or more of the exclusions from the definition of \u201cland use decision\u201d at ORS 197.015(10) and, accordingly, fell outside of LUBA\u2019s jurisdictional authority under ORS 197.825(1). Respondent relied upon ORS 197.015(10)(b)(H), which provides that \u201cland use decision\u201d does not include a local government decision</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b432-5\">\u201c[t]hat a proposed state agency action subject to ORS 197.180(1) is compatible with the acknowledged comprehensive plan and land use regulations implementing the plan, if:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b432-6\">\u201c(i) <em>The local government has already made a land use decision authorizing a use or activity that encompasses the proposed state agency </em>action;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b432-7\">\u201c(ii) The use or activity that would be authorized, funded or undertaken by the proposed state agency action is allowed without review under the acknowledged comprehensive plan and land use regulations implementing the plan; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b432-8\">\u201c(iii) The use or activity that would be authorized, funded or undertaken by the proposed state agency action requires a future land use review under the acknowledged comprehensive plan and land use regulations implementing the plant.]\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b432-9\">(Emphasis added.) Thus, the effect of ORS 197.015(10) and ORS 197.825(1) is to allow LUBA the authority to review the merits of a LUCS determination that a proposed state action is <em>not </em>compatible with local land use laws and to preclude such review of a LUCS determination of existing or potential compatibility, as described in ORS 197.015(10) (b)(H)(i), (ii).</p>\n<p id=\"b432-10\">LUBA concluded that the challenged decision was not a \u201cland use decision\u201d under ORS 197.015(10)(b)(H)(i). The board reasoned that the county authorized the landfill <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>in 1980 through the adoption of the Goal 2 exception in the comprehensive plan. According to LUBA, that decision authorized a use that \u201c\u2018encompasses\u2019 construction of future disposal cells\u201d for the landfill, and the construction of a higher berm for the disposal cells fits within that authorization.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-4\">In concluding that the LUCS was properly and completely based on a <em>past </em>land use decision (so that ORS 197.015(10)(b)(H)(i) applies), LUBA also decided that the county was correct in not basing the compatibility decision on the need for a <em>future </em>land use review, <em>i.e., </em>that the MSE berm required site design review. LUBA noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b433-5\">\u201cWe understand petitioners to contend that the proposed landfill expansion constitutes \u2018development\u2019 and YCZO 1101 plainly requires that \u2018all\u2019 development in the county\u2019s Public Facilities zones undergo site design review, with no exceptions. If so, we understand petitioners to argue, additional authorizations are necessary, and the exception at ORS 197.015(10)(b)(H)(i) does not apply.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b433-6\">\u201cHowever, YCZO 1101 and the YCZO in general are silent regarding whether site design review provisions apply to an otherwise outright permitted use, the expansion of which was authorized in an exception and comprehensive plan amendment and zone change decision that pre-dates adoption of those design review standards. When faced with that precise question in 1992, the board of commissioners chose not to require site design review for such an expansion. That choice flows naturally, if not inevitably, from the commissioners\u2019 conclusion that the 1980 decision authorized the sequential expansion of the landfill via continued construction of new disposal cells, including new berms, within the area zoned PWS. Because petitioners cite nothing in YCZO 1101 or elsewhere that purports to compel application of site design review provisions to development that, the county has determined, was authorized in the 1980 decision, petitioners have not demonstrated that further authorization is needed and that the exception at ORS 197.015(10)(b)(H)(i) is insufficient or does not apply to exclude the challenged decision from LUBA\u2019s jurisdiction.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b433-7\">(Footnote omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b433-8\">On review, petitioners claim that LUBA erred in dismissing the proceeding under ORS 197.015(10)(b)(H)(i). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>They argue that the 1980 plan and zoning changes, including the goals exception, did not \u201cauthoriz [e] a use or activity that encompasses\u201d the proposed MSE berm, that the county erred in concluding otherwise, and that LUBA erred in affirming the county\u2019s analysis in its LUCS and, accordingly, in dismissing the proceeding under ORS 197.015(10)(b)(H)(i). Specifically, petitioners contend that the 1980 plan and zoning changes authorized only the landfill described in the application for those changes and the exception findings and not the more intense and physically larger use facilitated by the MSE berm. In addition, petitioners argue that the 1980 decisions did not completely authorize any new facility that is required to obtain a site design review permit from the county before its construction or use and that the MSE berm is such a facility. Respondent counters that berms were contemplated and approved as part of, or \u201cencompass [ed]\u201d by, the 1980 land use decisions as necessary components of the approved landfill and that the county correctly interpreted its site design review ordinance to not require a permit for that type of development.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-4\">As noted, we conclude that LUBA did not err in determining that it lacked jurisdiction, because the county\u2019s LUCS is not a \u201cland use decision\u201d under ORS 197.015(10) (b)(H)(i). That is so because (1) the county\u2019s 1980 land use decisions specifically contemplated and explicitly authorized a landfill with berms, and the MSE berm is included or encompassed within the scope of that authorization, and (2) the 1992 interpretation of the county\u2019s site design review ordinance by its board to not require review of approved components of an expressly permitted land use was a reasonable construction of its site design review ordinance, so that (3) further land use review of the landfill use is not required by the county\u2019s land use regulations and the existing authorization is sufficient to qualify as a compatibility determination under ORS 197.015(10)(b)(H)(i). We examine each of those conclusions in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-5\">Petitioners first argue that the 1980 county actions (the plan change and rezoning) were insufficient to \u201cauthoriz [e] a use or activity that encompasses\u201d the proposed MSE berm under ORS 197.015(10)(b)(H)(i). Petitioners reason that those actions did not explicitly permit a particular type <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>of landfill, instead allowing only generic plan and zoning map changes to \u201cPublic Works Safety\u201d in order to allow a use as a \u201csanitary landfill.\u201d Some particulars of the landfill design, however, were described in the application for the plan/zone change, as well as in the master plan approved as part of the conditional use floodplain permit.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> And a specific form of landfill \u2014 one that was described as including \u201cconstruction techniques, as part of the proposal, [that] include a berm to prevent leaching of the Yamhill River\u201d \u2014 was examined as part of the adoption of the exceptions findings.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The legal effect of the comprehensive plan change and adopted exception findings, the zoning district amendment, and the conditional use floodplain permit was to authorize construction and operation of a landfill bounded by earthern berms and located on a 229-acre property zoned for that use, which use would expand within those boundaries over time.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-4\">We conclude that that authorization was sufficiently specific to \u201cencompass\u201d the western berm for the landfill and thereby exempt local review of the proposed state action from the definition of \u201cland use decision\u201d under ORS 197.015(10)(b)(H)(i).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The legal effect of the amendments to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>ORS 197.015(10) was to exempt from LUBA jurisdiction a local government or state agency compatibility decision that is based on either a past local government \u201cland use decision authorizing [the] use or activity\u201d or on particular allowances in the locality\u2019s land use regulations. Whether the county\u2019s LUCS determination was exempt from LUBA review under ORS 197.015(10)(b)(H)(i) depends upon whether the LUCS was based (1) on a past \u201cland use decision,\u201d (2) that authorized a \u201cuse or activity,\u201d (3) which use or activity \u201cencompass[ed]\u201d the proposed MSE berm. We give \u201cencompass\u201d its ordinary meaning \u2014 that is, to \u201cbring within\u201d or to \u201cinclude.\u201d <em>Webster\u2019s Third New Int\u2019l Dictionary </em>747 (unabridged ed 2002); <em>see PGE v. Bureau of Labor and Industries, </em>317 Or 606, 611, 859 P2d 1143 (1993) (\u201c[Wlords of common usage typically should be given their plain, natural, and ordinary meaning.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b436-4\">Here, the county made previous \u201cland use decision [s] \u201d authorizing a particular landfill bounded by earthen berms on land that was zoned for that use. A \u201cland use decision\u201d is a \u201cfinal decision or determination\u201d by a county that \u201cconcerns the * * * application\u201d of the goals, a comprehensive plan provision, or a land use regulation. ORS 197.015(10)(a). The particular determinations that were made earlier by the county were the plan and zoning changes involving the application of the goals and land use regulations, including the exceptions findings and the conditional use permit, authorizing fill on floodplain property, that was based on county land use regulations. Of those land use decisions, the exceptions findings and conditional use permit authorized or allowed a particular \u201cuse or activity\u201d \u2014 a landfill at a certain location with certain use characteristics to evolve over time. That approved \u201cuse\u201d included \u201ca berm to prevent leaching of the Yamhill River.\u201d The different construction and modified <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>location of the proposed berm did not change the category of that previously allowed use \u2014 a perimeter earthen berm associated with continued operation of the landfill. That type of use is the same type of \u201cuse or activity\u201d authorized by the proposed DEQ permit. As noted by the county in its findings, the \u201cMSE berm is a technical change only to the manner in which [respondent] constructs the perimeter berm of the landfill. It therefore continues the same use that was authorized in 1980, and it continues that use on the same property, all of which is zoned PWS.\u201d Thus, the MSE berm use is encompassed or included within the previous approval of an earthern berm for the landfill. Accordingly, LUBA did not err in concluding that it lacked jurisdiction to review the LUCS under ORS 197.015(10)(b)(H)(i).</p>\n<p id=\"b437-4\">LUBA also did not err in concluding that the MSE berm use had been fully authorized and would not need further local land use approvals, specifically a site design review permit, so that the board\u2019s lack of jurisdiction appropriately rested on ORS 197.015(10)(b)(H)(i).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The LUCS determination was made by a county planning official but was based upon the 1992 order by the board of county commissioners on an earlier LUCS for renewal of the DEQ solid waste permit. In the 1992 order, the county board concluded that the 1982 site design review ordinance did not require a permit for \u201cprimary landfill cell development,\u201d including the \u201clateral or vertical development of the Landfill,\u201d <em>i.e., </em>the \u201csize or height of the Landfill.\u201d According to the county board, site design review was required only for \u201cmodified or new facilities proposed or required as accessory uses to landfill operations.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b437-5\">The 1992 determination applied the site design review ordinance to the new land uses or activities proposed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>in the DEQ permit renewal. In effect, the county interpreted its site design review ordinance to apply to future proposed development and not to land uses or activities authorized as part of a previous land use decision that approved a development. YCZO 1101.01 states that the \u201csite design review process is intended to guide future growth and development,\u201d providing a \u201cframework to review commercial and industrial development proposals\u201d in order to \u201cresolve potential conflicts that may arise between proposed developments and adjacent uses.\u201d However, that same code section provides that it \u201cshall apply to all development\u201d in particular zoning districts. The county interpreted \u201call development\u201d to mean all land uses or activities not approved earlier.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-4\">The county board based its construction of the site design review ordinance on a November 1, 1991, opinion by its county counsel. That opinion distinguished between the lack of need for site design review for landfill \u201cdevelopment which was contemplated in the original application (such as additional landfill cells)\u201d as opposed to required site design review for \u201cdevelopment of substantial new facilities proposed or required as accessory uses to landfill operations.\u201d The county board\u2019s interpretation of YCZO 1101.01 to apply site design review processes to all new land uses and activities not approved earlier is a reasonable reconciliation of the ordinance provisions that countenance site design review processes for \u201cfuture * * * development\u201d and also \u201call development.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> We agree with LUBA\u2019s conclusion, noted earlier, that,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b438-5\">\u201c[b]ecause petitioners cite nothing in YCZO 1101 or elsewhere that purports to compel application of the site design review provisions to development that, the county has determined, was authorized in the 1980 decision, petitioners have not demonstrated that further authorization is needed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>and that the exception at ORS 197.015(10)(b)(H)(i) is insufficient or does not apply to exclude the challenged decision from LUBA\u2019s jurisdiction.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b439-4\">We therefore conclude that the review proceeding was properly dismissed by LUBA under ORS 197.015 (lOXbXHXi).</p>\n<p id=\"b439-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b428-7\"> Respondent Riverbend Landfill Company, Inc., was an intervenor-respondent in the LUBA proceedings.

The described master plan was specific enough to provide detail on a proposed dike, roadways within the landfill area, the location of access to Highway 18, the area of monitoring wells, and water quality control measures.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b435-6\"> The 1980 plan exception was not implemented by restrictive zoning to limit the uses of the property to those justified by the exception. Subsequent to the county action, LCDC adopted OAR 660-004-0018(4)(a), which requires that, when a reasons exception is adopted, the \u201cplan and zone designations must limit the uses, density, public facilities and services, and activities to only those that are justified in the exception.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b435-7\"> As noted, that statutory subsection is the first of three exemptions from the definition of \u201cland use decision\u201d in ORS 197.015(10)(b)(H). The exemptions, and other statutory changes to the state agency coordination processes required by ORS chapter 197, were enacted as House Bill (HB) 2230 in 2009. Or Laws 2009, ch 606, \u00a7 2. HB 2230 amended ORS 197.015(10)(b), as we have noted, to exclude from LUBA review authority a local government compatibility determination made because the state agency action (1) was authorized in a prior land use decision, (2) did not require local government land use review, or (3) is required to undergo future land use review. Analogously, ORS 197.015(10)(e) was amended <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>to exclude from the definition of \u201cland use decision\u201d those state agency land use decisions justified on the basis of a previous local government land use decision or otherwise allowed by general land use regulations. ORS 197.015(10)(e)(C). LCDC was delegated rule-making authority pursuant to ORS 197.180(3) to specify the sequence of related state and local land use decision-making. Or Laws 2009, ch 606, \u00a7 3. One of the stated purposes of those statutory changes was to \u201censure that local land use decisions authorizing a use generally precede state agency decisions on permits for the use or for aspects of the use.\u201d Or Laws 2009, ch 606, \u00a7 l(4)(a). At the same time, the legislature intended to limit \u201cmultiple opportunities to appeal the same land use decision.\u201d Staff Measure Summary, Senate Committee on Environment and Natural Resources, HB 2230, June 1, 2009.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b437-6\"> LUBA noted that, if site design review of the MSE berm were required, then it would lack jurisdiction under ORS 197.015(10)(b)(H)(iii) (no \u201cland use decision\u201d where the locality determines that the state agency use or activity \u201crequires a future land use review under * * * land use regulations\u201d). That conclusion assumes site design review is a \u201cuse review\u201d for purposes of ORS 197.015(10)(b)(H)(iii), an assumption that is debatable. ORS 197.015(12)(a)(B) defines a \u201climited land use decision\u201d to include a decision that regulates \u201cthe physical characteristics of a use permitted outright, including but not limited to site review and design review.\u201d Limited land use decisions are subject to approval processes under ORS 197.195 that differ from the procedures required to make a land use decision under ORS 197.763.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b438-6\"> Were we directly reviewing the county board interpretation of YCZO 1101.01, we would be obliged under ORS 197.829 to affirm the interpretation as plausible and \u201cnot inconsistent with the \u2018express language\u2019 of the provisions at issue or the purposes or policies underpinning them.\u201d <em>Siporen v.
