The court later entered an amended judgment that changed the caption of the judgment to \u201cgeneral judgment for contempt,\u201d but the body of the judgment still reflected that defendant was \u201cconvicted\u201d of a crime. On appeal, defendant argues that, notwithstanding the change to the caption, the judgment erroneously reflects that he was convicted of a crime when, in fact, he was not. <em>See J. L. J. v. Jung, </em>255 Or App 507, 508, 296 P3d 1287 (2013) (reversing judgment that \u201cerroneously states that [the defendant] was \u2018convicted\u2019 of contempt\u201d and remanding \u201cfor the trial court to enter a judgment that instead makes clear that defendant was found in contempt of court\u201d). We agree with defendant that the judgment erroneously states that he was convicted of the crime of contempt, and we reverse and remand for the trial court to enter a judgment that instead makes clear that defendant was found in contempt of court.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-5\">Reversed and remanded with instructions to enter judgment finding defendant in contempt of court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
