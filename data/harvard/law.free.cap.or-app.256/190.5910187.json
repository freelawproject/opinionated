J.</author>\n<p id=\"b216-4\">Plaintiff brought this action against the Lake County Fair Board (the board), alleging that the board rejected his job application in retaliation for his previously having complained that the board engaged in unlawful hiring practices \u2014 hiring a business partner of a board member and a relative of another board member. Plaintiff also, in a separate action, sued the board, alleging that the board\u2019s hiring practices violated statutes prohibiting conflicts of interest and that those hiring decisions were made at a meeting that did not conform to statutory notice requirements. <em>See Krisor v. Henry, </em>256 Or App 56, 300 P3d 199 (2013) <em>(Krisor I). </em>That earlier suit was dismissed as untimely; plaintiff appealed, and we dismissed the appeal as moot. <em>Id. </em>In this retaliation case, the trial court granted the board\u2019s motion for summary judgment on the ground that plaintiff\u2019s claim was precluded by the final judgment in <em>Krisor I. </em>Plaintiff now appeals, and we reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-5\">The facts are procedural and undisputed.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b216-6\">\u201cIn July 2008, a Lake County local newspaper published an advertisement notifying readers that the Lake County Fair Board was seeking a full-time maintenance technician for a position at the fairgrounds. Plaintiff applied for the position, but he was not one of the finalists who was chosen for an interview. Instead, the board hired Haffner. *** Plaintiff learned of Haffner\u2019s appointment on August 1, 2008.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b216-7\"><em>Krisor I, </em>256 Or App at 57 (footnote omitted). Plaintiff complained to members that the board\u2019s hiring of Haffner and another individual violated state conflict of interest provisions, and plaintiff threatened to file a lawsuit against the board. Shortly thereafter, Haffner\u2019s employment with the board ended and, in December 2008, the board began a search for a replacement. Plaintiff\u2019s application was reactivated, but on March 9, 2009, the board hired a different candidate.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-8\">Two lawsuits ensued. In July 2009, plaintiff filed a <em>pro se </em>complaint in <em>Krisor I </em>against the individual members of the board, alleging discrimination and \u201cnepotism\u201d and seeking $25,000,000 in damages. An amended <em>pro se </em>complaint followed in October of that year, naming the board <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>members \u201cin their official and individual capacities,\u201d alleging \u201cnepotism in violation of ORS 244.177,\u201d negligence, and breach of fiduciary duty, and seeking damages \u201cin an amount to be determined at trial.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b217-4\">In March 2010, before any hearing in <em>Krisor I, </em>plaintiff \u2014 now represented by counsel \u2014 filed the first and only complaint in this action, hereafter <em>Krisor II, </em>naming the board as defendant and alleging that the board discriminated against him based on his complaint of illegal hiring in 2008, contrary to ORS 659A.030(1)(f), and seeking damages of $1,370,000.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Finally, in April 2010, after filing <em>Krisor II, </em>plaintiff\u2019s counsel filed a third amended (and final) complaint in <em>Krisor I, </em>still naming the board members in their individual and official capacities, asserting a claim based on a violation of the public meetings law and seeking a judgment declaring that the decision to hire Haffner was void. The trial court ultimately granted the board\u2019s motion for summary judgment in <em>Krisor I </em>on the ground that plaintiff did not file his complaint within the applicable statute of limitations. We dismissed the appeal on the alternative ground that the complaint was moot because Haffner was no longer working for the board so the court had nothing to void. <em>Krisor I, </em>256 Or App at 59.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-5\">Meanwhile, some five months after the trial court decided <em>Krisor I, </em>it took up this case and ultimately ruled in favor of the board on the ground that this discrimination-by-retaliation claim was precluded by the final judgment in the public meetings case. Plaintiff appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-6\">As the Supreme Court has explained, \u201cclaim preclusion\u201d as that term is typically used, formerly known as <em>res judicata, </em>prohibits a party from relitigating a cause of action against the same defendant involving the same factual transaction as was litigated in the previous adjudication, if there has been a final judgment in the first action. <em>Drews v. EBI Companies, </em>310 Or 134, 139-40, 795 P2d 531 (1990); <em>Shuler v. Distribution Trucking Co., </em>164 Or App 615, 621, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>994 P2d 167 (1999), <em>rev den, </em>330 Or 375 (2000).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The doctrine bars not only claims that were raised in the first action, but claims that could have been raised there. <em>Drews, </em>310 Or at 140; <em>State ex rel English v. Multnomah County, </em>348 Or 417, 431-32, 238 P3d 980 (2010). Plaintiff argues that claim preclusion does not apply here for two reasons: First, defendant in this case (the board) is not the same as the defendants in the first case (board members \u201cin their official and individual capacities,\u201d including one person who is no longer on the board); and second, the two cases are not based on \u201cthe same factual transaction.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b218-4\">We disagree with plaintiffs first contention. Although plaintiffs original <em>pro se </em>complaint named individual members of the board as defendants, the operative complaint named them \u201cin their official and individual capacities.\u201d That complaint contained several allegations of conflict of interest directed toward individual members, one of whom was no longer a member of the board when <em>Krisor II </em>was filed. However, those allegations were extraneous to the actual <em>claim </em>contained in the complaint: that defendants participated in \u201cdecisions made by a public body in violation of the provisions of ORS 192.610 to 192.680.\u201d The referenced statutes all deal with public meetings; they do not deal with conflicts of interest. Further, the only relief that plaintiff sought in <em>Krisor I </em>was the injunctive remedy provided for in ORS 192.680(1): a declaration that the appointment made by the board at the allegedly unlawful meeting be declared void. Thus, to the extent that the complaint in <em>Krisor I </em>carried a caption naming individual board members, the only operative part of the complaint was directed toward the board <em>qua </em>board. Plaintiff essentially conceded this conclusion when, in response to a show cause order from the Appellate Commissioner, he stated that \u201cthe complaint alleges the defendants violated ORS 192.640 by holding a public meeting that was not properly noticed. This is an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>act that they can only take as a public body.\u201d Thereafter, the case caption named defendants as \u201cEd Henry, Junior Gabriel, Winsome Wells, George Jaska, and Ken Kestner <em>in their official capacity as Lake County Fair Board members.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) Under ORCP 34 F(1), \u201c[w]hen a public officer is a party to an action in such officer\u2019s official capacity and during its pendency dies, resigns, or otherwise ceases to hold public office, the action does not abate and such officer\u2019s successor is automatically substituted as a party.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b219-4\">Plaintiff argues that some of the <em>Krisor I </em>defendants retain their \u201cindividual capacity\u201d status, and therefore defeat a claim preclusion judgment, because they were potentially liable as individuals under ORS 192.680(4):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b219-5\">\u201cIf the court makes a finding that a violation of ORS 192.610 to 192.690 has occurred *** and that the violation is the result of willful misconduct by any member or members of the governing body, that member or members shall be jointly and severally liable to the governing body or the public body of which it is a part for the amount paid by the body under subsection (3) of this section [permitting an award of attorney fees to some prevailing challengers].\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b219-6\">That provision, however, has no bearing on the named individuals\u2019 status as defendants in <em>Krisor I; </em>it would make them defendants in an action that the board might (or might not) have chosen to file against them had the board been found to have acted unlawfully. In sum, we conclude that the defendant in <em>Krisor I </em>and <em>Krisor II </em>is the same entity: the Lake County Fair Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-7\">That conclusion brings us to the question of whether the two claims could have been brought in the same action. Treatment of that question has evolved over the years. Before the Supreme Court decision in <em>Dean v. Exotic Veneers, Inc., </em>271 Or 188, 196, 531 P2d 266 (1975), the court applied a version of the so-called \u201csame evidence\u201d test. Under that test, \u201cif the evidence needed to sustain two proceedings is different, those proceedings do not involve the same cause of action,\u201d and the two proceedings could be brought separately. <em>Id. </em>The court in <em>Dean </em>rejected the same evidence test, noting:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b220-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>\u201cAs permissible joinder of requests for various forms of relief and amendments during trial become broader and more liberal, the reasons behind [claim preclusion, formerly known as] res judicata dictate that parties to actions be required to make use of such liberal procedures and not be permitted to protract litigation through a multiplicity of suits or actions which can be disposed of in one proceeding. <em>See Clark on Code Pleading </em>472-78 (2d ed 1947); <em>see also, Jarvy v. Mowrey, 235 Or 579, 583, 385 </em>P2d 336 (1963). Therefore, with the advent of code pleading and the abandonment of rigid common law forms, the definition of\u2018cause of action\u2019 has tended to expand.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b220-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 192-93. In place <em>of </em>the same evidence test, the court applied what has come to be called the \u201ctransactional\u201d approach, in which claims cannot be split if they are based on \u201can aggregate of operative facts giving rise to a right or rights.\u201d Id. at 193 (quoting <em>Clark on Code Pleading, </em>127 (2d ed 1947)). An alternate formulation holds that two claims cannot be split if they both arise from the same factual transaction or \u201cconnected series of transactions.\u201d <em>Rennie v. Freeway Transport, </em>294 Or 319, 324, 656 P2d 919 (1982) (quoting <em>Restatement (Second) of Judgments </em>\u00a7 25 comment f (1982)). The Supreme Court has noted that \u201c[t]he two descriptions of what is a [single, unsplittable] claim are not far apart because any transaction is proved as an aggregate of facts showing it and its nature.\u201d <em>Peterson, </em>323 Or at 331 (quoting <em>Drews, </em>310 Or at 141 n 5). Whether claim preclusion applies in any situation is a fact-intensive question.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-6\">The facts in the present case lead us to conclude that this retaliation case was not precluded by <em>Krisor I. Lucas v. Lake County, </em>253 Or App 39, 289 P3d 320 (2012), provides persuasive guidance. In that case \u2014 the convoluted facts of which we simplify in order to focus on those aspects relevant to our analysis here \u2014 the plaintiff, a deputy sheriff sergeant, told the defendant\u2019s insurance representative that there had been incidents of sexual harassment and that they were the result of the defendant\u2019s inadequate training. <em>Id. </em>at 41, 46. The plaintiff\u2019s superior, the sheriff, was present when the plaintiff made that statement to the insurance representative. <em>Id. </em>Shortly thereafter, \u201cdefendant\u2019s Law <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>Enforcement Data System (LEDS) representative sent an e-mail to the state-wide LEDS Training and Education Manager falsely indicating that \u2018plaintiff had cheated on an examination required for access to [LEDS].\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 42. The next day, the defendant terminated the plaintiff. <em>Id. </em>Those two actions \u2014 the alleged defamation and the allegedly retaliatory termination \u2014 were subsequently encompassed in claims that the plaintiff made in federal court. <em>Id. </em>at 41-43.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-4\">The same day that the defendant terminated the plaintiff, the defendant allegedly \u201cblacklisted\u201d him, contrary to ORS 659.805, by</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b221-5\">\u201cfalsely report [ing] to the Department of State Police of the State of Oregon that plaintiff had been caught cheating on an examination for certification to access [LEDS], and arranged that this allegation be furnished to the Oregon Department of Public Safety Standards and Training in order to disqualify plaintiff from certification as a police officer or corrections officer in the State of Oregon.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b221-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 45 (second bracket in original). This allegation of \u201cblacklisting,\u201d along with another claim that is not relevant here, was then encompassed in a <em>state </em>court action by the plaintiff. <em>Id. </em>at 44-45. \u201cUnlike his defamation claim in federal court \u2014 which concerned a statement that was made <em>before </em>his termination \u2014 the allegations comprising plaintiff\u2019s blacklisting claim concerned statements and conduct that occurred <em>after </em>his termination.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 45 (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b221-7\">Next, the federal court granted summary judgment to the defendant on all of the plaintiff\u2019s claims. <em>Id. </em>at 47. Thereafter, the defendant filed a motion for summary judgment in state court on the ground that the state <em>blacklisting </em>claim was precluded by the final judgment in the federal <em>defamation </em>claim. <em>Id. </em>at 47. The trial court agreed and subsequently entered a judgment in favor of the defendant. <em>Id. </em>at 50. On appeal, we reversed, holding (among other things) that the blacklisting claim was <em>not </em>precluded. <em>Id. </em>at 55. We explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b221-8\">\u201c[W]e conclude that plaintiff\u2019s blacklisting claim did not arise out of the same transaction as did his defamation claim in federal court. In general terms, the factual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>transaction at issue in the federal action involved the circumstances surrounding plaintiff\u2019s termination. In that context, the defamation claim concerned a single false <em>statement </em>\u2014 viz., that plaintiff had cheated on his LEDS exam and encouraged another employee to do so as well\u2014 made by one of defendant\u2019s employees to create, as plaintiff theorized, a pretextual justification for plaintiff\u2019s subsequent termination. Further, although plaintiff alleged that defendant defamed him to interfere with his ability to obtain employment, plaintiff sought damages only for emotional distress and the harm caused to his reputation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b222-4\">\u201cAs did plaintiff\u2019s defamation claim, the subject matter of plaintiff\u2019s blacklisting claim concerns communications about plaintiff\u2019s dishonesty and unfitness. Nevertheless, plaintiff\u2019s blacklisting claim concerns a different factual transaction. That is so for at least two reasons.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b222-5\">\u201cFirst, plaintiff\u2019s blacklisting claim involved communications that occurred over a substantial period of time after his termination that are distinct from the single communication that was the subject of his defamation claim and that the federal court concluded was privileged. Thus, the facts concerning the circumstances surrounding those later communications, including when and between whom they were made, will be different from those adjudicated as part of plaintiff\u2019s defamation claim.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b222-6\">\u201cSecond, the gravamen of plaintiff\u2019s federal action was that his termination was wrongful. In that context, plaintiff\u2019s defamation claim \u2014 which was predicated on defendant\u2019s allegedly false statement that plaintiff had cheated on his LEDS examination \u2014 functioned as a vehicle for plaintiff to establish that defendant\u2019s purported reason for terminating him was pretextual. By contrast, his blacklisting claim alleges that defendant\u2019s subsequent communications were motivated by a different purpose\u2014 <em>viz., </em>to \u2018disqualify plaintiff from certification as a police officer or corrections officer in the State of Oregon\u2019 and to \u2018prevent [] plaintiff from securing employment as a police officer or corrections officer in the State of Oregon.\u2019 The factual bases underlying those distinct motivations will themselves be distinct.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b222-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 54-55.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>The two claims in the present case are far more distinct from each other than the defamation and blacklisting claims in <em>Lucas. </em>Although the public meetings claim in <em>Krisor I </em>and the retaliation claim in this case are related to each other in that they both stem from plaintiff\u2019s dissatisfaction with defendant\u2019s employment practices as applied to the maintenance technician job at the fair grounds, the two claims involve different factual transactions. The first involves the facts from July 2008 surrounding an allegedly unlawfully convened and conducted public meeting; the second involves the facts from March 2009 underlying an employment decision, that is, the decision not to interview plaintiff in retaliation for his earlier complaint. In the first action, plaintiff sought only injunctive relief, in particular, the voiding of the decision to hire Haffner; in the second, he seeks damages for the board\u2019s later allegedly retaliatory action. Insofar as plaintiff alleged a motive underlying the board\u2019s action in <em>Krisor I, </em>it was some members\u2019 desire to hire relatives and business associates; the alleged motive underlying the board\u2019s action in <em>Krisor II </em>is members\u2019 desire to inflict harm on plaintiff in retaliation for his prior complaint of illegal hiring in 2008.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-4\">We therefore echo our decision in <em>Lucas. </em>Under the circumstances described above, we conclude that plaintiff\u2019s retaliation claim was not part of the same factual transaction that was litigated in <em>Krisor I. </em>Accordingly, the trial court erred in allowing summary judgment as to plaintiff\u2019s retaliation claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-5\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b217-7\"> ORS 659A.030(l)(f) provides that it is an unlawful employment practice \u201c[flor any person to *** discriminate against any other person because that other person has opposed any unlawful practice, or because that other person has filed a complaint * * * in any proceeding under this chapter or has attempted to do so.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b218-5\"> We say as \u201ctypically used\u201d because the rule of claim preclusion actually encompasses two rules: bar and merger. The rule of bar, at issue in this case, \u201cis the principle most often described by the term \u2018claim preclusion.\u2019 That rule prohibits parties from splitting claims by requiring plaintiffs to \u2018bring all claims arising from the same factual transaction or circumstances in a single action.\u2019 <em>Peterson v. Temple, </em>323 Or 322, 327, 918 P2d 413 (1996).\u201d <em>State ex rel English v. Multnomah County, </em>348 Or 417, 432, 238 P3d 980 (2010).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
