ORS 426.130. In his third assignment of error, he contends that the trial court erred in denying him counsel \u201cor alternatively, in allowing him to waive his rights to counsel without sufficient inquiry.\u201d <em>See </em>ORS 426.100(3). The state concedes that the trial court erred in allowing appellant to represent himself at the involuntary commitment hearing without an express waiver and that, accordingly, the trial court\u2019s judgment should be reversed. We agree, accept the state\u2019s concession, and reverse on that basis. Accordingly, we do not address appellant\u2019s first and second assignments of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-5\">Reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
