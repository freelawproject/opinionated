(AGAT) seeks review of a final order of an administrative law judge (ALJ) that affirmed a tax assessment issued by the Employment Department (the department). In the challenged order, the ALJ determined that certain truck drivers whom AGAT paid to transport cargo were AGAT\u2019s employees, rejecting AGAT\u2019s contention that the drivers were independent contractors. Based on that determination, the ALJ concluded that the drivers\u2019 compensation was subject to unemployment tax, which AGAT had not paid. The ALJ also rejected AGAT\u2019s argument that its payments to one driver, Kotlyarenko, were exempt from unemployment tax under ORS 657.047(1)(b) because Kotlyarenko had leased a vehicle to AGAT and was, therefore, the lessor of a for-hire carrier.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On review, AGAT challenges both aspects of the ALJ\u2019s order. As explained below, we affirm the ALJ\u2019s conclusion that certain drivers (other than Kotlyarenko) were employees, but reverse and remand for the ALJ to reconsider whether AGAT\u2019s compensation of Kotlyarenko was exempt on the basis that he was the lessor of a for-hire carrier.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-5\">We state the facts consistently with the ALJ\u2019s unchallenged factual findings and the uncontroverted evidence in the record.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> At all pertinent times, AGAT was a business that arranged the transport of goods. AGAT did not provide transportation services directly but instead <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>contracted with individual drivers, using two types of contracts: \u201cParties/Percentage Contract[s]\u201d (PPCs) and what AGAT called \u201cIndependent Contractor Agreement [s]\u201d (ICAs). AGAT\u2019s petition for judicial review relates to the status of those drivers who operated under the PPCs; the status of the ICA drivers is not at issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-4\">Under the PPCs, AGAT identified transport opportunities with various shippers of goods and offered those jobs to the PPC drivers. The drivers were free to accept or reject those jobs and could determine their own availability for work. The PPC drivers could hire other people to perform transportation services for them, but only if those people were deemed \u201cqualified\u201d by AGAT\u2019s safety department. In addition, the PPCs prohibited drivers from carrying passengers and required them to call AGAT\u2019s dispatch center frequently: every day when in transit; immediately after loading and unloading cargo; any time a driver was delayed or off schedule; and \u201cwhen instructed to do so.\u201d Either AGAT or the PPC drivers could terminate the contracts, without cause, after giving 30 days\u2019 written notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-5\">The PPCs allowed drivers to provide their own vehicles for transport. In practice, however, most (perhaps all) of the PPC drivers leased trucks from AGAT under a \u201clease to own\u201d agreement that was a part of the PPC; as the ALJ characterized it, \u201cthe equipment lease was only a provision within the PPC, and not a separate agreement.\u201d Under that \u201clease to own\u201d provision, a driver could establish title to a truck after making payments to AGAT for a specified number of years and, while leasing the truck, could use it to enter into transportation contracts with other businesses. If the PPC was terminated, the lease would end, AGAT would retain the truck, and AGAT would refund the driver\u2019s principal investment.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b322-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>PPC drivers were required to get AGAT\u2019s permission before having repairs or maintenance work performed on the equipment they leased from AGAT. In addition, the drivers were required to carry cargo insurance and fire/theft/ collision insurance. Regardless of what vehicle a PPC driver used, the driver was required to display signs and insignia that AGAT specified.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-4\">In October 2010, the Employment Department Tax Section sent a Notice of Tax Assessment to AGAT stating that the company owed unemployment insurance tax for compensation paid to drivers in 2008 and 2009, but had not paid employment taxes on that compensation. AGAT requested a hearing, and the department referred the matter to the Office of Administrative Hearings, which appointed an ALJ to resolve the dispute.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-5\">The fundamental question before the ALJ was whether the PPC drivers qualified as employees, whose compensation was subject to employment taxes, or as independent contractors, whose payment was exempt from such taxes. <em>See </em>ORS 657.040(1) (\u201cServices performed by an individual for remuneration are deemed to be employment subject to this chapter unless and until it is shown to the satisfaction of the Director of the Employment Department that the individual is an independent contractor, as that term is defined in ORS 670.600.\u201d). For purposes of unemployment insurance, \u201cindependent contractor\u201d means a person \u201cwho provides services for remuneration and who, in the provision of the services\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b322-6\">\u201c(a) Is free from direction and control over the means and manner of providing the services, subject only to the right of the person for whom the services are provided to specify the desired results;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b322-7\">\u201c(b) * * * [I]s customarily engaged in an independently established business;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b322-8\">\u201c(c) Is licensed under ORS chapter 671 or 701 if the person provides service for which a license is required under ORS chapter 671 or 701; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b322-9\">\u201c(d) Is responsible for obtaining other licenses or certificates necessary to provide the services.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b323-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>ORS 670.600(2). Those statutory criteria are conjunctive, so each must be met for a person to be considered an \u201cindependent contractor.\u201d <em>Avanti Press v. Employment Dept. Tax Section, </em>248 Or App 450, 456, 274 P3d 190 (2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b323-4\">In this case, the disputed issues at hearing were whether the PPC drivers were (1) free from direction and control over the means and manner of providing services and (2) customarily engaged in independently established businesses.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Noting that AGAT had the burden to prove that the department\u2019s assessment was incorrect, ORS 657.683(4), the ALJ determined that AGAT had not proved either that the PPC drivers were \u201cfree from direction and control\u201d by AGAT or that the drivers were \u201ccustomarily engaged in an independently established business.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b323-5\">AGAT separately contended that the compensation it had paid to one driver, Kotlyarenko, was exempt from employment tax under ORS 657.047(l)(b) because Kotlyarenko had leased a vehicle to AGAT, making him the lessor of a for-hire carrier. AGAT based this second argument on evidence \u2014 which AGAT asserted it had e-mailed to the ALJ\u2014 that Kotlyarenko had signed a PPC and had leased AGAT a vehicle that he owned, pursuant to an \u201cEquipment Lease Contract.\u201d However, the ALJ found that it was \u201cunknown what agreement, if any,\u201d AGAT had entered into with Kotlyarenko and implicitly concluded that AGAT had not established that the department\u2019s assessment as to that driver was incorrect.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-6\">On review, AGAT raises two assignments of error. First, the company argues that the ALJ erred in upholding the department\u2019s tax assessment with respect to Kotlyarenko. In support of that argument, AGAT references a PPC and an \u201cEquipment Lease Contract\u201d that are included in the excerpt of record to its brief, which AGAT asserts it submitted to the ALJ by e-mail together with its written closing argument. Because those documents were before the ALJ, AGAT contends, substantial evidence does not support the ALJ\u2019s finding that it is \u201cunknown\u201d what agreement Kotlyarenko had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>with AGAT. The department responds by asserting that the ALJ did not admit Kotlyarenko\u2019s PPC and equipment lease contract into the evidentiary record. It contends, therefore, that this court should disregard those documents. Alternatively, the department argues, we should remand the case to the ALJ for reconsideration if we conclude that Kotlyarenko\u2019s PPC and lease contract are indeed \u201cin the judicial review record.\u201d We take the latter course.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-4\">The judicial review record that the department initially transmitted to this court did not include either Kotlyarenko\u2019s PPC or his equipment lease contract. However, the department moved to correct the record in order to include those documents, along with AGAT\u2019s closing argument, and the Appellate Commissioner granted its motion. Accordingly, those documents are part of the record on judicial review. Admittedly, it is not clear to us whether the ALJ intended to consider the attachments to AGAT\u2019s closing argument as part of the <em>evidentiary </em>record on which he could base his determination regarding Kotlyarenko\u2019s status. However, at least some of the ALJ\u2019s statements during the hearing suggested that he might consider attachments to AGAT\u2019s e-mail. Under the circumstances, we deem it appropriate to remand the order to the ALJ for reconsideration of AGAT\u2019s argument that Kotlyarenko\u2019s compensation was exempt from taxation. On reconsideration, the ALJ will have an opportunity to clarify whether Kotlyarenko\u2019s PPC and equipment lease contract are part of the evidentiary record and, if so, to determine in the first instance whether Kotlyarenko was, therefore, the lessor of a for-hire carrier whose compensation was exempt from taxation under ORS 657.047(1)(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b324-5\">In its second assignment of error, AGAT challenges the ALJ\u2019s conclusion that the PPC drivers were employees, not independent contractors. Except for one factual finding that we do not include in our analysis,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> AGAT does not contend that the ALJ\u2019s pertinent findings of historical fact are unsupported by substantial evidence. Rather, AGAT challenges only the ALJ\u2019s ultimate ruling that the PPC drivers were not independent contractors. That ultimate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>determination \u2014 whether a particular person is an employee or independent contractor \u2014 is a question of law. <em>Schaff v. Ray's Land &amp; Sea Food Co., Inc., </em>334 Or 94, 101 n 3, 45 P3d 936 (2002) C\u201c[W]here there is no dispute as to what the arrangement is, the question of employee or independent contractor is one of law for the court.\u2019 \u201d (Citation omitted.)); <em>see Avanti, </em>248 Or App at 459 (similar). Moreover, determining whether a certain individual meets the statutory criterion of being \u201cfree from direction and control over the means and manner of providing the services, subject only to the right of the person for whom the services are provided to specify the desired results,\u201d ORS 670.600(2)(a), also involves a legal question; it is not a pure question of fact. That is the necessary implication of our decision in <em>Avanti, </em>another unemployment tax case. <em>See </em>248 Or App at 459, 466-71 (addressing interpretation <em>and application </em>of ORS 670.600 and the administrative rules relating to the \u201cdirection and control\u201d test as legal questions, not fact questions that are reviewed only for substantial evidence).</p>\n<p id=\"b325-4\">As explained above, a person who provides services for remuneration can be an independent contractor only if the person meets certain requirements, including being \u201cfree from direction and control over the means and manner of providing the services, subject only to the right of the person for whom the services are provided to specify the desired results\u201d and being \u201ccustomarily engaged in an independently established business.\u201d ORS 670.600(2). AGAT contends that its PPC drivers met both of those requirements. We disagree, and we affirm the ALJ\u2019s determination that the PPC drivers were employees because they were not free from AGAT\u2019s control over the means and manner by which they provided services.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b325-5\">The statutory \u201cdirection and control\u201d test addresses two aspects of a person\u2019s work: the means and the manner by which the person provides services. ORS 670.600(2)(a). An administrative rule defines \u201cmeans\u201d as \u201cresources used or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>needed in performing services.\u201d OAR 471-031-0181(3)(a)(A). To be free from direction and control over the means of providing services, a person \u201cmust determine which resources to use in order to perform the work, and how to use those resources.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The rule also defines \u201cmanner,\u201d stating that the word means \u201cthe method by which services are performed.\u201d OAR 471-031-0181(3)(a)(B). To be free from direction and control over the manner of providing services, a person \u201cmust determine how to perform the work.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b326-4\">In this case, AGAT asserts that the PPC drivers were free from AGAT\u2019s direction and control over the means of transporting goods because the evidence indicates that they could choose to provide a truck, rather than leasing one from AGAT; if they did lease trucks from AGAT, they were responsible for those vehicles; they could drive the trucks for other carriers; they purchased their own insurance; and they provided other equipment they deemed necessary, like computers or GPS devices. AGAT also argues that the PPC drivers were free from direction and control over the manner of transport because, for example, they established their own schedules, had the option of accepting or rejecting jobs, could carry other carriers\u2019 cargo, and could hire other people to help perform the work.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-5\">The department responds that the ALJ\u2019s determination that AGAT controlled the means of the PPC drivers\u2019 work is supported by evidence that \u201cAGAT had the right to \u2014 and did \u2014 control the vehicles used by the PPC drivers, because it owned them, approved who could operate them, and had the right to limit how the driver could use them.\u201d With respect to the manner of work, the department focuses on AGAT\u2019s requirements that PPC drivers display signs and insignia specified by AGAT, that the drivers adhere to terms regarding pickup and delivery specified in the contracts between AGAT and its customers, and that drivers call AGAT\u2019s dispatch center at various specified times, as well as whenever they were \u201cinstructed to do so.\u201d The department also points to AGAT\u2019s right to terminate the PPC agreements if the drivers carried passengers, drove while under the influence of various substances, failed to correct \u201cnoncompliance\u201d by the driver\u2019s own employees, or failed to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>inform AGAT of citations, violations, or damage to AGAT\u2019s equipment or cargo.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-4\">We conclude that the department has the better argument, although we do not agree with all aspects of its analysis. In considering whether a purported employee is \u201cfree from direction and control over the means and manner of providing the services, subject only to the right of the person for whom the services are provided to specify the desired results,\u201d ORS 670.600(2)(a), one must bear in mind that a person who is compensated for performing services virtually always will be subject to <em>some </em>level of oversight by the entity or individual for whom the work is performed. <em>See Avanti, </em>248 Or App at 461 (\u201c[T]he right to control test * * * has never required that an \u2018independent contractor\u2019 be free from <em>all </em>direction and control.\u201d (Emphasis in original.)). The critical question is whether that oversight relates primarily to \u201cspecifying] the <em>desired results\u201d </em>of the work, ORS 670.600(2)(a) (emphasis added), or, instead, to having authority to control the way in which the work is performed (\u201cthe means and manner of providing the services\u201d). In making the distinction between those two types of control, it is important to focus on the type of service performed, and consider whether it is <em>that </em>service \u2014 not the end result\u2014 over which the individual providing services is free from direction and control.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-5\">Thus, in <em>Avanti, </em>we considered the significance of evidence that a company provided a sales representative with \u201corder forms, price lists, catalogs, and other promotional materials\u201d that she could use in selling the company\u2019s products. 248 Or App at 470. The ALJ had ruled that the company\u2019s provision of those materials indicated the company\u2019s control over the sales representative\u2019s means of performance. <em>Id. </em>at 470-71. We disagreed. Under the circumstances involved in that case, we held, \u201cthe use of that type of promotional material [was] more aptly considered part of [the company\u2019s] right to specify the \u2018desired results\u2019 \u2014 that is, those materials pertain more to <em>what </em>[the sales representative] solicits than to <em>how </em>she solicits.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 471.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-6\">Here, too, some of the factors the department relies on relate primarily to AGAT\u2019s right to specify the desired <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>results of the PPC drivers\u2019 work, and not to the way in which the drivers perform that work. In particular, AGAT\u2019s requirement that its drivers meet the expectations of AGAT\u2019s customers regarding pickup and delivery relates primarily to the \u201cdesired results\u201d; it does not indicate control over the means or manner by which drivers could achieve that goal.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-4\">Considering the totality of the circumstances, however, we conclude that the PPC drivers were not free from AGAT\u2019s direction and control over the means and manner in which they performed their services. In that regard, AGAT\u2019s ownership and control over the trucks that the PPC drivers operated is significant.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> We start from the premise that, if the trucks belonged to AGAT and the drivers had no interest in the equipment, the drivers probably would be employees, as they could not be said to be free from AGAT\u2019s control over the \u201cresources used or needed in performing services.\u201d OAR 471-031-0181(3)(a)(A). Here, of course, the PPC drivers leased trucks from AGAT pursuant to lease-to-own arrangements. However, as the ALJ found, \u201cthe equipment lease was only a provision within the PPC, * * * not a separate agreement [,]\u201d and the lease would end upon termination of the PPC \u2014 an event that AGAT could cause to occur without cause, upon 30 days\u2019 notice. The record includes no evidence that a person could enter a similar lease agreement with AGAT without also contracting to be a driver; nor does the record suggest that a driver whose PPC contract was terminated could choose to continue leasing his or her truck, making payments under the lease-to-own agreement. In short, the truck leases were coextensive with the PPC driving contracts and had no independent existence. Thus, as a practical matter, AGAT supplied the PPC drivers with the primary piece of equipment they needed to be able to provide driving services to the company. The expediency of a lease agreement that is inextricably intertwined with the driving contract cannot change what otherwise would be an employment relationship into an independent contracting agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>Our conclusion that the PPC drivers were not independent contractors is not based solely on the lease agreement, however, but also on other indicia that AGAT exerted control over how the drivers did their work. AGAT prohibited the PPC drivers from carrying passengers, it required the drivers to contact dispatch at various times that did not necessarily relate to the desired result associated with any given shipping job, and it allowed PPC drivers to hire other drivers to help with transportation services only if AGAT first determined that those drivers were qualified.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> In short, the ALJ\u2019s factual findings lead to the conclusion that AGAT controlled not only the trucks that the PPC drivers used, but also the manner in which those individuals performed their driving services. Accordingly, with the exception of Kotlyarenko, the ALJ did not err in concluding that the PPC drivers were not independent contractors.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-4\">Reversed and remanded for reconsideration of AGAT\u2019s contention that driver Kotlyarenko was the lessor of a for-hire carrier; otherwise affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b320-6\"> ORS 657.047(1)(b) \u201cexcludes from the definition of employment services performed by a driver * * * under lease to a motor carrier.\u201d <em>3P Delivery, Inc. v. Employment Dept. Tax Section, </em>254 Or App 180, 182, 295 P3d 83 (2012).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b320-7\"> AGAT does not separately assign error to any of the ALJ\u2019s factual findings, but it does contend that three findings are not supported by substantial evidence. First, AGAT contends that the record does not support the ALJ\u2019s statement that \u201c[i]t is unknown what agreement, if any,\u201d AGAT had with driver Kotlyarenko. We address that contention in our discussion of AGAT\u2019s first assignment of error. Second, AGAT challenges the finding that certain drivers could hire other drivers \u201conly with [AGAT\u2019s] written authorization.\u201d We have disregarded that finding in our analysis, so we need not determine whether the record supports it. Finally, AGAT contends that no evidence supports what it claims to be a finding that AGAT controlled the routes that all of its drivers took, pointing to the ALJ\u2019s assertion that AGAT \u201chad the right to determine the transportation route.\u201d We read that clause as referring only to drivers operating under a different kind of contract than the one at issue in this case, and not to the drivers whose status is the subject of AGAT\u2019s request for judicial review.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b321-6\"> While the PPC was in effect \u2014 that is, while the drivers made lease payments to AGAT- \u2014 AGAT typically paid the drivers 88 to 90 percent of all \u201cNet Gross Revenue,\u201d defined as the net amount that AGAT charged the shipper \u201cafter deductions for discounts, commissions, and other fees and charges other than operating expenses.\u201d According to the PPCs, that percentage payment was meant to compensate the drivers for \u201cthe use of the motor vehicles\u201d as well as the services the drivers performed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b323-7\"> The drivers were not required to be licensed under either OES chapter 671 or OES chapter 701, so the third criterion was not applicable, and the department did not dispute that the PPC drivers met the fourth criterion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b324-6\"> <em>See </em>256 Or App at 296 (discussing finding).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b325-6\"> Because we agree with the ALJ\u2019s determination that the PPC drivers were not free from AGAT\u2019s direction and control, we need not address the ALJ\u2019s additional determination that those drivers were not customarily engaged in independently established businesses.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b328-5\"> Kotlyarenko may be an exception if he did, in fact, own his own truck and lease it to AGAT.

Even if we agreed with AGAT\u2019s implicit contention that it would not exercise \u201ccontrol\u201d merely by requiring that any additional drivers meet legal requirements for providing driving services (a point that we do not address), AGAT did more than that in this case. It did not simply specify that any additional drivers meet certain legal requirements. Instead, it mandated that the PPC drivers (1) have <em>AGAT </em>confirm that any additional drivers met licensing requirements, (2) have additional drivers take a drug test <em>as specified by AGAT, </em>and (3) wait for AGAT to approve them for driving. That is the essence of \u201cdirection and control.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
