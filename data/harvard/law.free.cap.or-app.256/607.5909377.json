The issue in this case is whether defendant, an insurer, \u201cformally instituted\u201d arbitration proceedings within two years of the accident such that plaintiff\u2019s UIM claim against defendant accrued. The trial court concluded that defendant\u2019s letter to plaintiff\u2019s attorney stating, in part, that defendant \u201chereby consents to submit this case to binding arbitration\u201d did not \u201cformally institute\u201d arbitration proceedings and, on that basis, concluded that plaintiff\u2019s claim was barred by ORS 742.504(12)(a). Plaintiff appeals the resulting judgment entered in favor of defendant, arguing that, under the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Bonds v. Farmers Ins. Co., </em>349 Or 152, 240 P3d 1086 (2010), the trial court erred in concluding that defendant had not \u201cformally instituted\u201d arbitration proceedings. We agree with plaintiff and, accordingly, reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-5\">The relevant facts are undisputed. Plaintiff claims that he was injured in an automobile accident caused by an underinsured motorist on December 29, 2007. At the time of the accident, plaintiff was insured under an automobile policy with defendant that included UIM coverage. Shortly before December 29, 2009 \u2014 the two-year anniversary of the accident \u2014 defendant sent plaintiff\u2019s attorney a letter that stated, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b633-6\">\u201cPursuant to ORS 742.061, [defendant] accepts coverage and agrees that the only issues are the liability of the uninsured/underinsured motorist and the damages due <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"610\">*610</page-number>your client.[<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>] <em>[Defendant] hereby consents to submit this case to binding </em>arbitration.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b634-3\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b634-4\">On January 11, 2010, plaintiff filed a UIM claim against defendant. In response, defendant moved for summary judgment on the ground that plaintiffs claim was barred under ORS 742.504(12)(a), which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b634-5\">\u201cThe parties to this coverage agree that no cause of action shall accrue to the insured under this coverage unless within two years from the date of the accident:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b634-6\">\u201c(A) Agreement as to the amount due under the policy has been concluded;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b634-7\">\u201c(B) <em>The insured or the insurer has formally instituted arbitration proceedings',</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b634-8\">\u201c(C) The insured has filed an action against the insurer; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b634-9\">\u201c(D) Suit for bodily injury has been filed against the uninsured motorist and, within two years from the date of settlement or final judgment against the uninsured motorist, the insured has formally instituted arbitration proceedings or filed an action against the insurer.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b635-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"611\">*611</page-number>(Emphasis added.) Plaintiff then moved for partial summary judgment, arguing that defendant\u2019s letter \u201cconsent [ing] to submit this case to binding arbitration\u201d had \u201cformally instituted\u201d arbitration proceedings under ORS 742.504(12)(a)(B) within the required two-year period so that the claim accrued.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-4\">The trial court concluded that defendant\u2019s letter was merely \u201ca consent to arbitrate and not a formal initiation of arbitration\u201d and that, accordingly, plaintiff\u2019s claim had not timely accrued. On that basis, it granted defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment, denied plaintiff\u2019s motion for partial summary judgment, and entered a general judgment in defendant\u2019s favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-5\">Plaintiff appeals, contending that, under <em>Bonds, </em>the trial court erred in concluding that defendant\u2019s letter \u201cconsent [ing] to submit this case to binding arbitration\u201d had not \u201cformally instituted\u201d arbitration proceedings within the meaning of ORS 742.504(12)(a)(B). Defendant, also relying on <em>Bonds, </em>responds that the court correctly concluded that defendant did not \u201cformally institute\u201d arbitration proceedings by making that written statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-6\">In <em>Bonds, </em>the Supreme Court held that, to \u201cformally institute\u201d arbitration proceedings under ORS 742.504(12)(a)(B),</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b635-7\">\u201can insured or insurer expressly must communicate to the other party that the initiating party is beginning the process of arbitrating the dispute. The first step in that process is the party\u2019s offer to utilize the arbitration process. Thus, to \u2018formally institute\u2019 arbitration proceedings, an insured or an insurer must expressly communicate to the other party that the initiating party offers to arbitrate or otherwise commits to the arbitration process.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b635-8\">349 Or at 162. The court further noted that, \u201cwhen a party begins arbitration, the party will do so in an obvious and express way, such as occurs when a party sets forth, either in one document or in multiple documents that are part of a single message, a notice, offer, or demand for arbitration.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 162-63.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"612\">*612</page-number>The court then considered whether two letters written by the defendant, an insurer, to the plaintiff regarding the plaintiff\u2019s UIM claim met that standard. In doing so, the court described those letters as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b636-4\">\u201cThe first letter acknowledged plaintiff\u2019s UIM claim and stated, \u2018Should we disagree on the liability/damages owed by the underinsured motorist, [defendant] consents to submit this matter to binding arbitration.\u2019 The second letter stated that defendant disagreed about the extent of the damages owed \u2014 in particular, the representative stated that plaintiff already had been compensated for his injuries through the other driver\u2019s insurance coverage \u2014 and that plaintiff was not entitled to UIM benefits. The representative offered, however, to consider additional information about plaintiff\u2019s alleged injuries. Both letters likely arrived on the same day.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b636-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 154 (footnote omitted; brackets in original). The court noted that \u201c[t]he first letter indicated a willingness to arbitrate, depending on whether a future event \u2014 disagreement\u2014 occurred. The second letter did not definitively state that a disagreement existed, nor did it mention arbitration.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 163 (footnote omitted). On that basis, the court concluded that, \u201c[w]here, as here, a party\u2019s consent to arbitrate is contingent on some future event and that party does not expressly advise or acknowledge to the other party that that event has occurred, no \u2018formal institution\u2019 of arbitration proceedings has occurred.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 164.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-6\">Plaintiff argues that defendant\u2019s letter \u201cconsenting] to submit this case to binding arbitration\u201d is the type of express communication exhibiting a party\u2019s willingness to commit to arbitration that \u201cformally institutes\u201d arbitration proceedings under <em>Bonds. </em>Defendant responds that a \u201cconsent\u201d \u2014 even one that is not contingent on a future event \u2014 can never \u201cformally institute\u201d arbitration proceedings. That is so because, in defendant\u2019s view, the Supreme Court in <em>Bonds </em>limited the formal institution of arbitration proceedings to those instances where a party provides \u201ca notice, offer, or demand for arbitration,\u201d and a party\u2019s \u201cconsent\u201d to arbitrate is not \u201ca notice, offer, or demand.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b637-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"613\">*613</page-number>We read <em>Bonds </em>to implicitly hold that a party\u2019s express \u201cconsent\u201d to arbitration suffices to \u201cformally institute\u201d arbitration proceedings under ORS 742.504(12)(a)(B) in circumstances where that consent is not made explicitly contingent on a future event. Contrary to defendant\u2019s assertions, the Supreme Court\u2019s holding in <em>Bonds </em>was not predicated on a conclusion that a party\u2019s \u201cconsent\u201d to arbitration \u2014 as opposed to a party\u2019s \u201cnotice, offer, or demand for arbitration\u201d \u2014 can never \u201cformally institute\u201d arbitration proceedings. Rather, as noted, the Supreme Court held that, \u201c[w]here, as here, <em>a party\u2019s consent to arbitrate is contingent on some future event and that party does not expressly advise or acknowledge to the other party that that event has occurred, </em>no \u2018formal institution\u2019 of arbitration proceedings has occurred.\u201d 349 Or at 164 (emphasis added). That is, the court in <em>Bonds </em>held that the defendant\u2019s letters did not suffice to \u201cformally institute\u201d arbitration proceedings because <em>the consent given in the first letter was explicitly conditional and the condition was never satisfied. </em>Had the court concluded that \u201cconsent\u201d \u2014 contingent or not \u2014 can never \u201cformally institute\u201d arbitration proceedings under ORS 742.504(12)(a)(B), it would have had no reason to consider and decide whether the condition governing the defendant\u2019s consent was satisfied. Thus, the court implicitly concluded that a party\u2019s <em>unconditional </em>consent to arbitration is sufficient to \u201cformally institute\u201d arbitration proceedings under the statute.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b638-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"614\">*614</page-number>As noted, in this case, defendant sent plaintiff\u2019s attorney a letter stating that defendant \u201chereby consents to submit this case to binding arbitration.\u201d Although we recognize that every offer or consent to arbitrate is necessarily implicitly contingent on the existence of <em>some point of dispute </em>between the parties, the court in <em>Bonds </em>based its holding on the fact that the defendant\u2019s consent was made <em>explicitly </em>contingent on the occurrence of a future event\u2014 disagreement between the parties on the issues of liability or damages. Here, in contrast, defendant\u2019s consent was not made <em>explicitly </em>contingent on the occurrence of any future event. Accordingly, in so consenting, defendant took the \u201cfirst step\u201d toward the arbitration process. <em>Bonds, </em>349 Or at 162. That is, it \u201cexpressly communicate[d]\u201d to plaintiff that it was \u201ccommittfed] to the arbitration process.\u201d <em>Id. </em>On that basis, we conclude that, under <em>Bonds, </em>defendant \u201cformally instituted\u201d arbitration proceedings within the requisite two-year period under ORS 742.504(12)(a)(B), and plaintiff\u2019s UIM claim was therefore not barred by that statute. The trial court erred in concluding otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-4\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b633-7\"> ORS 742.504has been amended several times since the accident that gave rise to plaintiff\u2019s underinsured motorist claim. However, because those amendments do not affect our analysis, we refer to the current version of the statute throughout this opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b634-10\"> Under ORS 742.061(3), an insurer insulates itself from the possibility of owing attorney fees to a plaintiff in relation to the plaintiff\u2019s claim for uninsured or underinsured motorist benefits</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b634-11\">\u201cif, in writing, not later than six months from the date proof of loss is filed with the insurer!,] [t]he insurer has accepted coverage and the only issues are the liability of the uninsured or underinsured motorist and the damages due the insured; and [t]he insurer has consented to submit the case to binding arbitration.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b634-12\">Defendant argues that, in stating that it \u201chereby consents to submit this case to binding arbitration,\u201d it intended only to utilize the safe harbor provision in ORS 742.061(3) to insulate itself from possible liability for plaintiff\u2019s attorney fees, and that that intent is dispositive as to whether defendant \u201cformally instituted\u201d arbitration proceedings under ORS 742.504(12)(a)(B). We disagree. Defendant\u2019s intent is immaterial to whether its statement to plaintiff had the legal effect of \u201cformally instituting]\u201d arbitration proceedings under the statute.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b634-13\"> Together, the provisions of ORS 742.504(1) to (12) constitute a model policy as to UIM coverage. <em>Vega v.

That is, insurers are required to include in their UIM policies \u201ccoverage that in each instance is no less favorable in any respect to the insured or the beneficiary than if the *** provisions [of ORS 742.504(1) to (12)] were set forth in the policy.\u201d ORS 742.504. In this case, defendant incorporated the provisions of ORS 742.504(12)(a) in its contract with plaintiff. Where the terms of ORS <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"611\">*611</page-number>742.504(12)(a) are incorporated in parties\u2019 contracts, the terms of that model policy are operative.
