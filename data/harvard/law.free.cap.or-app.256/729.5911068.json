The Workers\u2019 Compensation Board (board) applied the firefighters\u2019 presumption, and employer seeks judicial review. For the following reasons, we reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-5\">The facts, as found by the administrative law judge (AL J) and adopted by the board, are supported by substantial evidence. Claimant is a fire district chief and has worked for employer for over 30 years. In June 2007, the Clackamas County Sheriffs Office informed claimant that one of his long-time employees had embezzled $1.9 million over several years. The sheriffs office asked claimant to go undercover and to gather evidence against the employee, which claimant agreed to do. Following the employee\u2019s arrest, claimant was the subject of public concern and anger over the embezzlement, with some members of the public calling for his removal. Claimant experienced stress as a result of his undercover assignment and the community anger directed at him.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-6\">In October 2007, after talking to several people about the embezzlement at a high school football game, claimant was having trouble sleeping. He asked his wife whether she had overheard an individual\u2019s comment at the game about the embezzlement, and she responded that she was \u201csick and tired of living and breathing that embezzlement since July\u201d and had seen what the embezzlement had done to claimant and their family. Claimant began to rub his wife\u2019s shoulder when his \u201carm just sort of went numb.\u201d He began to experience chest pain and was taken to the hospital. He was diagnosed with myocardial infarction, more commonly known as a heart attack.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-7\">Five medical experts provided opinions concerning the cause of claimant\u2019s myocardial infarction: Drs. Greenberg, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"731\">*731</page-number>Samoil, Semler, DeMots, and Toren. Each doctor agreed that claimant had an underlying coronary artery disease (arteriosclerosis) unrelated to his employment, which contributed to his myocardial infarction. Samoil believed that stress from the embezzlement was a \u201ccausative factor\u201d of the myocardial infarction, whereas Greenberg believed that the stress and arteriosclerosis contributed equally to the myocardial infarction. DeMots characterized claimant\u2019s \u201cacute stress\u201d during the conversation with his wife about the embezzlement to be \u201cat most a trigger or precipitating factor.\u201d Semler and Toren likewise did not exclude claimant\u2019s work-related stress as contributing to the myocardial infarction, but they believed that any such contribution was minor.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-4\">Claimant filed a workers\u2019 compensation claim, contending that his myocardial infarction was a compensable occupational disease, ORS 656.804, which employer denied. Claimant requested an evidentiary hearing and argued to the ALJ that the \u201cfirefighters\u2019 presumption\u201d under ORS 656.802(4), which presumes that the cause of the condition or impairment is related to the firefighter\u2019s employment, applied. In denying compensation, the ALJ determined that claimant\u2019s heart attack was caused or worsened by mental stress associated with the embezzlement and treated the claim as a mental disorder claim. <em>See </em>ORS 656.802(l)(b) (\u201c\u2018[M]ental disorder\u2019 includes any physical disorder caused or worsened by mental stress.\u201d). The ALJ concluded that the firefighters\u2019 presumption does not apply to claims for a mental disorder and, instead, applied the heightened compensability standard for mental disorders set forth in ORS 656.802(3). In general, that standard requires the claimant to establish that (1) the employment condition producing the mental disorder exists, (2) the employment condition is not generally inherent in every work situation, (3) the diagnosed mental disorder is generally recognized in the medical or psychological community, and (4) there is clear and convincing evidence that the mental disorder arose out of and in the course of employment. ORS 656.802(3)(a) - (d). The ALJ concluded that claimant did not carry his burden of proving that the mental stress, which led to claimant\u2019s heart attack, was work related, and affirmed the denial.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"732\">*732</page-number>Claimant sought review with the board, arguing that the firefighters\u2019 presumption applies and that employer did not establish by \u201cclear and convincing medical evidence that the cause of the condition or impairment [was] unrelated to the firefighter\u2019s employment\u201d as required by ORS 656.802(4). Employer countered that the firefighters\u2019 presumption does not apply, because claimant\u2019s myocardial infarction lacks the renal component to qualify as a \u201ccardiovascular-renal disease\u201d as required by ORS 656.802(4). In addition, employer contended that claimant did not establish that his myocardial infarction, which was caused by stress, met the criteria for establishing a compensable mental disorder under ORS 656.802(l)(b) and (3).</p>\n<p id=\"b756-4\">A divided board agreed with claimant and reversed the AL J\u2019s decision. In doing so, the majority framed the issues as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b756-5\">\u201cThus, if claimant was not a qualifying firefighter under ORS 656.802(4), his claimed [myocardial infarction] would be treated as a \u2018mental disorder\u2019 because it is a \u2018physical disorder caused or worsened by mental stress.\u2019 <em>See </em>ORS 656.802(l)(b). Claimant would then need to meet the heightened standards of proving a compensable mental disorder as set forth in ORS 656.802(3). Conversely, if analyzed as a \u2018cardiovascular-renal disease\u2019 under ORS 656.802(4), the claim would be presumptively compensable, with the employer required to demonstrate with \u2018clear and convincing evidence that the cause of the condition or impairment [was] unrelated to the firefighter\u2019s employment.\u2019\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b756-6\">The majority reasoned that the firefighters\u2019 presumption applies to claimant\u2019s myocardial infarction, because, when the legislature originally enacted the firefighters\u2019 presumption, it relied on submissions and testimony that considered a firefighter\u2019s mental stress to contribute, in part, to presumptively compensable diseases, such as cardiovascular-renal disease. The board also ruled that the heightened standard for mental disorders under ORS 656.802(3) does not apply to workers who meet the firefighters\u2019 presumption. The board concluded that, under the firefighters\u2019 presumption, claimant\u2019s myocardial infarction was compensable as a cardiovascular-renal disease.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"733\">*733</page-number>On judicial review, in its first assignment of error, employer renews its argument that a myocardial infarction is not a \u201ccardiovascular-renal disease\u201d and further argues, in its second assignment of error, that, when a cardiovascular disease is caused by a stress-related mental disorder, the firefighters\u2019 presumption does not apply, but the higher standard set forth in ORS 656.802(3) applies. Claimant responds that, when the legislature enacted the firefighters\u2019 presumption, it intended to include heart conditions, such as myocardial infarctions, in the firefighters\u2019 presumption. Claimant also contends that the heightened compensability standard set forth in ORS 656.802(3) establishes whether a condition qualifies as an \u201coccupational disease,\u201d and that, because the firefighters\u2019 presumption presumes that a condition is an occupational disease, it supersedes the need to satisfy the mental disorder standard under ORS 656.802(3). Because we agree with employer\u2019s second assignment of error and resolve the case on that basis, we need not address employer\u2019s first assignment of error. Instead, for the purposes of our analysis, we will assume that claimant\u2019s myocardial infarction is a cardiovascular-renal disease that qualifies for the firefighters\u2019 presumption. <em>See City of Eugene v. McCann, </em>248 Or App 527, 533-34, 273 P3d 348 (2012) (declining to address whether \u201ccardiovascular-renal disease\u201d in ORS 656.802(4) requires a firefighter\u2019s condition to be a disease of the cardiovascular <em>and </em>renal system when case could be resolved on other grounds).</p>\n<p id=\"b757-4\">We review the board\u2019s order for legal error. ORS 183.482(8)(a). The resolution of this case requires us to interpret ORS 656.802; thus, we apply the familiar methodology of <em>PGE v. Bureau of Labor and Industries, </em>317 Or 606, 610-12, 859 P2d 1143 (1993), as amplified in <em>State v. Gaines, </em>346 Or 160, 206 P3d 1042 (2009). Our task is to determine the intent of the legislature when it enacted ORS 656.802, which we glean from the text, context, and legislative history, resorting if necessary to maxims of statutory construction. <em>Gaines, </em>346 Or at 171-72.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-5\">To establish a compensable occupational disease, generally, a claimant \u201cmust prove that employment conditions were the major contributing cause of the disease.\u201d ORS 656.802(2)(a). However, certain conditions or impairments <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"734\">*734</page-number>suffered by a firefighter are presumed to be work-related under ORS 656.802(4), which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b758-3\">\u201cDeath, disability or impairment of health of firefighters of any political division who have completed five or more years of employment as firefighters, caused by any disease of the lungs or respiratory tract, hypertension or cardiovascular-renal disease, and resulting from their employment as firefighters is an \u2018occupational disease.\u2019 Any condition or impairment of health arising under this subsection shall be presumed to result from a firefighter\u2019s employment. However, any such firefighter must have taken a physical examination upon becoming a firefighter, or subsequently thereto, which failed to reveal any evidence of such condition or impairment of health which preexisted employment. Denial of a claim for any condition or impairment of health arising under this subsection must be on the basis of clear and convincing medical evidence that the cause of the condition or impairment is unrelated to the firefighter\u2019s employment.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b758-4\">If a claimant\u2019s condition or impairment qualifies for the firefighters\u2019 presumption, the claim cannot be denied unless the employer proves by clear and convincing medical evidence that the cause of the condition was not work-related. The firefighters\u2019 presumption is unusual in that it does not place the burden on the worker to establish the work-disease relationship, but rather shifts the burden to the employer to disprove it. <em>Wright v. SAIF, </em>289 Or 323, 332, 613 P2d 755 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b758-5\">When a firefighter suffers from a physical disorder caused by work-related mental stress, the firefighters\u2019 presumption appears to conflict with the heightened compensability standard for mental disorders. \u201c[A]ny physical disorder caused or worsened by mental stress\u201d is a mental disorder, ORS 656.802(l)(b), and a mental disorder is defined as an occupational disease, ORS 656.802(l)(a)(B). Stress-caused physical disorders are not compensable unless the heightened compensability requirements of ORS 656.802(3) are satisfied:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b758-6\">\u201c(3) <em>Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, </em>a mental disorder is not compensable under this chapter unless the worker establishes all of the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b759-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"735\">*735</page-number>\u201c(a) The employment conditions producing the mental disorder exist in a real and objective sense.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b759-4\">\u201c(b) The employment conditions producing the mental disorder are conditions other than conditions generally inherent in every working situation or reasonable disciplinary, corrective or job performance evaluation actions by the employer, or cessation of employment or employment decisions attendant upon ordinary business or financial cycles.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b759-5\">\u201c(c) There is a diagnosis of a mental or emotional disorder which is generally recognized in the medical or psychological community.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b759-6\">\u201c(d) There is clear and convincing evidence that the mental disorder arose out of and in the course of employment.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b759-7\">(Emphasis added.) \u201cThe function of a \u2018notwithstanding clause\u2019 is to make the statute an exception to the provision of law to which the clause refers.\u201d <em>SAIF v. Falconer, </em>154 Or App 511, 521, 963 P2d 50 (1998), <em>rev den, </em>328 Or 330 (1999) (De Muniz, J., dissenting); <em>accord Severy v. Board of Parole, </em>318 Or 172, 178, 864 P2d 368 (1993). The notwithstanding clause italicized above makes the heightened compensability standard under ORS 656.802(3)(a) to (d) an exception to any provision in ORS chapter 656. And, because the firefighters\u2019 presumption is aprovision in ORS chapter 656 \u2014 indeed, a subsection of the same statute \u2014 the heightened compensability standard for mental disorders applies instead of the firefighters\u2019 presumption.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-8\">The legislative history supports our plain-text analysis. In 1987, ORS 656.802 was amended significantly by House Bill (HB) 2271 to include the compensability standard in ORS 656.802(3).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Representative Shiprack, the chair of the House Labor Committee, explained to the Senate Labor Committee the statutory requisites for a worker to establish a compensable mental disorder. During his description of paragraph (b), which requires the worker to establish \u201cconditions other than conditions generally <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"736\">*736</page-number>inherent in every working situation,\u201d he explained that the standard would not be different for firefighters as compared to other workers:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b760-4\">\u201c[Representative Shiprack:] [Paragraph] b says that they\u2019ve got to be conditions other than those conditions inherent in any, pardon me, in every working situation. So that means that they would have to be something that everyone would, everyone would agree are inherent to what you see everyday in the workplace.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b760-6\">\u201c [Senator Hannon:] If I may stop you just for a moment, Representative. <em>Could that same set of standardfs] be used for office worker versus say like a firefighter? </em>Would the same basis, standard apply in the same workplace?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b760-7\">\u201c[Representative Shiprack:] The intent there, Senator, is that in the workplace, you are expected to show up on time, you are expected to cooperate, perhaps, with your fellow employees, you are expected to have certain things unrelated to the specific occupations involved. This may also address itself to the fact that perhaps in every, in every experience, you will suffer times of layoff. It is not\u2014 <em>the intent of this is not to say that a firefighter has a more stressful job than someone digging ditches, perhaps, although, occasionally it may be that way. </em>We didn\u2019t want to get into that. <em>That is not the intent of the House to say that this profession is something, and this isn\u2019t. </em>But there are certain duties in the workplace that are inherent in every job and that\u2019s what we\u2019re trying to say it here.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b760-8\">Tape Recording, Senate Labor Committee, HB 2271, Apr 23, 1987, Tape 120, Side A (statement of Rep Bob Shiprack) (emphasis added). Rather than explaining that firefighters were held to a different standard, possibly through the firefighters\u2019 presumption, Representative Shiprack explained that the bill was not intended to distinguish among the different occupations. The italicized text demonstrates that the legislature intended to apply the heightened standard for mental disorders to all workers with mental disorders, including firefighters, and did not intend to exclude that category of workers based on the firefighters\u2019 presumption in ORS 656.802(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b761-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"737\">*737</page-number>Claimant argues, that when the legislature originally enacted the firefighters\u2019 presumption in 1961, it intended the presumption to include conditions caused or worsened by stress. Claimant relies on the board\u2019s summary of the legislative history pertaining to the enactment of the firefighters\u2019 presumption. That summary referred to testimony from the Oregon State Fire Fighters Council about how \u201cstress and strain\u201d and extreme temperatures, gas, and smoke connected with firefighting predisposes firefighters to heart disease. Testimony, Senate Labor and Industries Committee, HB 1018, Mar 8, 1961 (statement of Earl Noble, secretary of the Oregon State Fire Fighters Council). Claimant contends that testimony is evidence that the legislature did not intend to apply the heightened compensability standard for mental disorders under ORS 656.802(3) to a firefighter\u2019s stress-related claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-4\">We disagree. The testimony that the legislature heard in 1961 did not include stress caused by everyday work situations that employees may face in any job. The testimony from the Oregon State Fire Fighters Council concerned the emotional and physical strain associated with fighting fires and rescuing people in dangerous situations. The 1961 legislature did not contemplate stress related to everyday work activities. That discussion of \u201ceveryday stress\u201d did not occur until 1987, when the heightened compensability standard for mental disorders was added to ORS 656.802. And, as we noted above, the legislature contemplated mental stress claims in <em>all occupations </em>and chose not to distinguish firefighters. Accordingly, we conclude that, when a worker who would ordinarily qualify for the firefighters\u2019 presumption has a claim for a mental disorder, the compensability standard for mental disorders set forth in ORS 656.802(3) applies.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-5\">In this case, the board found, and the parties do not dispute, that claimant\u2019s physical disorder \u2014 myocardial infarction \u2014 was caused or worsened by mental stress. Thus, claimant\u2019s myocardial infarction must be treated as a mental disorder, ORS 656.802(l)(b) (\u201c\u2018[M]ental disorder\u2019 includes any physical disorder caused or worsened by mental stress.\u201d), and must be analyzed under ORS 656.802(3). Therefore, we conclude that the board erred when it applied the firefighters\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"738\">*738</page-number>presumption under ORS 656.802(4) rather than the mental disorder standard set forth in ORS 656.802(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b762-4\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b759-9\"> HB 2271 listed the heightened compensability standard for mental disorders under subsection ORS 656.802(2).
