On appeal, he asserts that the trial court erred in imposing two $500 unitary assessments on those convictions because the statute that provided for those assessments was repealed effective January 1, 2012. <em>See former </em>ORS 137.290(2)(b) (2009), <em>repealed by </em>Or Laws 2011, ch 597, \u00a7 118; Or Laws 2012, ch 89, \u00a7 1. The state agrees that the trial court erred in imposing the assessments because \u201cno current statutory provision that applies to [defendant\u2019s] fourth-degree assault and harassment convictions authorizes imposition of such an assessment.\u201d We agree and accept the state\u2019s concession. Accordingly, the case must be remanded for the trial court to enter a corrected judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-5\">Reversed and remanded for entry of a corrected judgment deleting the $500 assessments on each conviction; otherwise affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
