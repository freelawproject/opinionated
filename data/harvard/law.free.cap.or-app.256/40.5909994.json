Petitioner argues that PSRB erred in denying his conditional release in 2010, because it previously agreed, in a 2008 order, to conditionally release him while he was on post-prison supervision under conditions set by the Board of Parole and Post-Prison Supervision (BOPPS).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> PSRB responds that it did not violate the 2008 agreement, because, as part of that agreement, PSRB reserved the right to review and reject BOPPS\u2019s plan under the statutes and regulations governing conditional release. We agree with petitioner and conclude that PSRB\u2019s view of the 2008 agreement is not supported by substantial evidence. Accordingly, we reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-5\">The following facts are undisputed. In 2002, petitioner was found guilty except for insanity on two counts of second-degree assault, placed under PSRB jurisdiction for a period not to exceed 10 years, and committed to the Oregon State Hospital. ORS 161.295; ORS 163.175. In 2005, petitioner left the state hospital without authorization and lived on the streets of Portland for nearly two years, until he was arrested and returned to the state hospital in 2007. Petitioner was charged with second-degree escape, ORS 162.155. Before petitioner\u2019s 2008 PSRB hearing, petitioner and the state agreed to propose to PSRB that petitioner would stipulate to PSRB\u2019s continuing jurisdiction, dismiss all of petitioner\u2019s pending litigation against the state arising from his PSRB commitment case,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> plead guilty to second-degree escape, and serve a 32-month term of incarceration on that conviction at the Oregon State Penitentiary. The state, in exchange, would recommend that PSRB conditionally release petitioner from the Oregon State Hospital to the Department of Corrections (DOC) for his prison term <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>and, after his prison term, petitioner would be conditionally released subject to the conditions set by BOPPS, so long as petitioner\u2019s circumstances or conduct did not change substantially from the time of the 2008 order. The agreement between the parties \u2014 petitioner and the state \u2014 was conditional until approved by PSRB. The parties presented that agreement to PSRB at a hearing on April 23, 2008.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-4\">During that hearing, PSRB expressed concerns about adopting the proposed agreement, in light of PSRB\u2019s statutory considerations:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b66-5\">\u201c[PSRB Board Member]: [I]n terms of our responsibility to do what we can to ensure community safety first and foremost ***, I wonder [if] we don\u2019t have an obligation to consider the appropriateness for conditional release or discharge in those last months of jurisdiction. We are saying in advance that that is going to provide for communityt \u2014 ]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b66-6\">\u201c [PSRB Chair]: That sounds like a matter for deliberation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b66-7\">\u201c[PSRB Board Member]: Yes, that\u2019s my[ \u2014 ]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b66-8\">\u201c[Assistant Attorney General (AAG)]: May I add a comment with respect to that * * * issue, and that\u2019s during the two years that he\u2019s on post-prison supervision you\u2019ll discover whether or not it\u2019s working um, because he\u2019ll either violate the terms of post-prison supervision and your conditional release or he won\u2019t.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b66-9\">\u201c [Petitioner\u2019s Attorney]: * * * I think petitioner has proved that under no supervision, he is not a danger to others or the public.

If he violated the terms of his post-prison supervision or committed a new crime while he was in custody [ \u2014 ]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b67-8\">\u201c[PSRB Chair]: Then he would in effect be violating the conditions [ \u2014 ]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b67-9\">\u201c[AAG]: Exactly.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b67-10\">\u201c[PSRB Chair]: Set by the Board. Alright.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b67-11\">\u201c[PSRB Board Member]: I have an additional question, Mr. Chair, if I may?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b67-12\">\u201c[PSRB Chair]: Please inquire.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b67-13\">\u201c[PSRB Board Member]: The parole and post-release supervision * * * people who staff those programs * * * have caseloads of varying sizes and * * * provide a highly variable degree of actual supervision from basically none unless there is a problem to * * * fairly frequent and close supervision.

Thank you, we\u2019ll go off the record for a few moments, we\u2019ll call you back.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b67-19\">At that point, PSRB recessed for deliberations.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>When PSRB came back on the record, the chair stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b68-5\">\u201cThe Board has deliberated, [and] essentially we are agreeable to the * * * discussion that you had earlier and the stipulated agreement that you proposed. [W]e *** accept your stipulation to the appropriateness of the jurisdiction of the Board. That is, that you have a mental disorder which, when active, presents a substantial danger to others and are therefore appropriately under the Board\u2019s jurisdiction. [Furthermore], we find you appropriate for conditional release to the Department of Corrections for a sentence of 30 months once sentenced based on a plan *** that you have worked out and imposed by the Marion County Judge since there\u2019s been no pleading at this time, that would be a condition. <em>And after the completion of your prison sentence, as agreed to, in January 2011, we would ask that you return to the Board for approval of the Post-Prison Supervision plan for a period of two years. </em>[F]inally, we would again ask that you come back for a hearing * * * for us to consider full discharge in January 2013 by action of this Board based on the State\u2019s recommendation at that time and successful completion of the sentence and Post-Prison Supervision as you have mutually agreed to. And all of this of course, is contingent upon your offer to drop all pending litigation against the Board and the State of Oregon relating to your disposition here and * * * hope that is * * * sufficiently clear with respect to the agreement that the, the two of you have reached.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b68-6\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b68-7\">The board then asked if the parties had any comments, and this exchange followed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b68-8\">\u201c[Petitioner\u2019s Attorney]: [M]y only real comment is *** I think it\u2019s clear, I\u2019m going to want to see the written decision out of the Board so it will be clear. <em>[I]f it\u2019s the way we\u2019ve agreed, then we\u2019re fine. </em>[O]ne thing I need to know is approximately, or if we can get a little bit more than approximately, when *** I might see a written decision. [W]e would hope *** that once *** I see it and approve, actually the language, * * * then that\u2019s when we\u2019ll go in and plead * * * in Marion County.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b68-10\">\u201c[PSRB Board Member]: Once you have an agreeable order from the * * * Board [ \u2014 ]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b69-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>\u201c [Petitioner\u2019s Attorney]: Correct.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b69-4\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b69-5\">On May 6, 2008, the day before PSRB issued its written order, petitioner pleaded guilty to the second-degree escape charge in the Marion County Circuit Court. In explanation of petitioner\u2019s willingness to plead guilty, petitioner\u2019s attorney told the trial court that PSRB had approved the parties\u2019 proposed agreement at the April 23, 2008, hearing:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b69-6\">\u201c[PSRB] has agreed that they will conditionally release [petitioner] to the prison sentence that Your Honor is about to sentence him to; that they will then conditionally release him after his prison sentence is completed to the post-prison supervision terms that [BOPPS] set for him. They can \u2014 [PSRB] can ask [BOPPS] to add conditions, but if [BOPPS] does not add the conditions that [PSRB] wants, they cannot revoke [petitioner] because of that. In other words, they may ask them to force [petitioner] to live in a group home. If [BOPPS] does not put that as a condition, they can\u2019t revoke him just because of that. They may still be able to revoke him based on his behavior, in other words if he commits a new crime, but otherwise they have agreed to have concurrent conditional release from his commitment to the State Hospital and post-prison supervision.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b69-7\">In its written order on May 7, 2008, PSRB stated that it had \u201caccept [ed] as findings of fact the stipulations of the parties as set forth by the parties at the outset of the hearing.\u201d Those stipulations included the parties\u2019 agreement that the Attorney General\u2019s representative would ask PSRB to approve petitioner\u2019s conditional release after he served his prison term, and that petitioner would serve that post-prison supervision term under conditions set by BOPPS. Furthermore, the 2008 order specifically recited that, pursuant to the parties\u2019 agreement,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b69-8\">\u201c[PSRB] could ask [BOPPS] to consider conditions [PSRB] might think were appropriate in addition to the standard conditions that [BOPPS] would require but that [PSRB] will accept the conditions set by [BOPPS] unless [petitioner\u2019s] circumstances or behavior had substantially changed from the date of this order.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b70-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>The order recited that the proposed agreement \u2014 including that PSRB \u201cwill accept the conditions set by [BOPPS]\u201d\u2014 \u201cwould only be effective if [PSRB] were to agree to it in its entirety.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b70-4\">The May 7, 2008, order also stated that petitioner could be adequately controlled and treated by DOC and that petitioner \u201cmay be conditionally released once [PSRB] has received a copy of a judgment order imposing the agreed upon sentence in his current [e] scape charge as well as documentation that [petitioner] has moved to dismiss all his pending litigation against the State of Oregon and [PSRB].\u201d PSRB received the necessary documentation and subsequently issued a conditional release order on May 21, 2008. Petitioner then was conditionally released to DOC jurisdiction and served his time at the Oregon State Penitentiary without incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-5\">When petitioner completed his prison sentence in 2010, PSRB revoked his conditional release and held a hearing to consider the adequacy of his post-prison supervision plan.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> At the hearing, petitioner\u2019s counsel stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b71-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>\u201cWe have an agreement. *** The agreement included coming back here before you, so you could finalize the conditions that you had already agreed to, unless [petitioner] had done something broadly wrong. * * * If you\u2019re telling me you\u2019re not, you\u2019re, there\u2019s a question about the agreement, there is no question about the agreement, it\u2019s set forth in the, all of the transcripts.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b71-4\">The AAG agreed with petitioner\u2019s understanding of the agreement:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b71-5\">\u201cIn looking at Exhibit 78,1 can\u2019t disagree with [petitioner\u2019s counsel] that it appears there was [an] agreement struck between a past Board, in April of 2008 and [petitioner]. And so it seems to me that um, what we should be about at this hearing, is determining if [petitioner], this Board needs to satisfy itself that [petitioner] is basically in the same position now, that he was in 2008 with respect to his mental health and if he is, then I don\u2019t have, I have a hard time disagreeing with [petitioner\u2019s counsel] that ah, [petitioner] should not be conditionally release [d]. If there\u2019s not something that would prevent him from being conditionally released, based upon the doctor\u2019s evaluation of him * * * within a reasonable time period * * *, then I think the agreement * * * looks like he needs to be released, conditionally released.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b71-6\">Nonetheless, PSRB determined that it had never agreed to accept the conditions set by BOPPS and that it had reserved the right to insist upon additional conditions of release. In its 2010 order, PSRB \u201cacknowledged the agreement that was reached by the parties at the 2008 hearing and took note that [petitioner] had not had any incidents nor revocations while imprisoned.\u201d However, PSRB denied petitioner\u2019s conditional release on the ground that the conditions in BOPPS\u2019s order were legally insufficient. PSRB found that it had \u201cindicated at the time of the 2008 hearing that [PSRB] would ask that [petitioner] return to [PSRB] for approval of the post-prison supervision plan upon the completion of his prison sentence\u201d and that \u201c [it] expected a plan to be presented that conformed to [PSRB\u2019s] standards.\u201d Having considered BOPPS\u2019s order, PSRB determined, \u201cbased upon the lack of information provided to [PSRB] as required by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>its statutes and administrative rules [,] particularly ORS 161.336 and OAR 859-070-0015\u201d that \u201cthe supervision and treatment necessary are not available in the community. Therefore, it would not be in the best interest of justice and the protection of society to release [petitioner] at this time.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b72-4\">On judicial review, petitioner argues that, as part of the 2008 agreement, PSRB agreed to accept the conditions set by BOPPS, and PSRB erred in concluding that it had reserved the right to reject the release conditions set by BOPPS. In response, PSRB concedes that, had it actually agreed to accept the conditions for release set forth by BOPPS, such an agreement would be binding.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> PSRB argues, however, that nowhere in the record, either in written form or oral, did it agree to \u201crubber stamp\u201d a parole plan with just general supervision conditions. Rather, PSRB contends that the 2008 hearing transcript \u2014 specifically, the board chair\u2019s statement that, \u201cafter the completion of your prison sentence, as agreed to, in January 2011, we would ask that you return to [PSRB] for approval of the Post-Prison Supervision plan for a period of two years\u201d \u2014 makes clear that PSRB inserted its own additional condition that petitioner return to PSRB for consideration and approval of the post-prison supervision plan proposed by BOPPS. PSRB argues that its chair\u2019s statement was an implicit rejection of the parties\u2019 term that PSRB would defer to conditions set by BOPPS.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b72-5\">Given the posture of this case, including the parties\u2019 respective arguments, the question before us is whether there is any support in the record for PSRB\u2019s determination that it had reserved the right to review and reject the adequacy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>of the conditions of release set forth by BOPPS. <em>See </em>ORS 183.482(8); <em>former </em>ORS 161.385(9)(c) (2009), <em>renumbered as </em>ORS 161.348(3) (2011). For the reasons that follow, we agree with petitioner on that issue: PSRB unambiguously agreed to \u201caccept the conditions set by [BOPPS] unless [petitioner\u2019s] circumstances or behavior had substantially changed from the date of this order.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b73-4\">As set forth above, the terms of petitioner\u2019s proposed settlement agreement with the state were presented clearly to PSRB, including the term in dispute here: that, after his prison term, petitioner would be conditionally released subject to the conditions <em>set by BOPPS. </em>That is, as the agreement was presented, there was no dispute that BOPPS, not PSRB, would decide the release conditions and that PSRB would simply provide input to BOPPS. The state\u2019s attorney made that explicit to PSRB during the hearing, stating that \u201cthe Parole Board will set those conditions and to the extent that this Board may or may not have any concerns, you can communicate those to the Parole Board.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b73-5\">PSRB nonetheless maintains that it approved a different agreement from the one the parties proposed. That is, PSRB maintains that, at the 2008 hearing, it approved an agreement that contained a materially different term than the parties had proposed \u2014 specifically, an agreement that allowed PSRB to review the sufficiency of the release conditions imposed by BOPPS. That term was added, according to PSRB, when, at the 2008 hearing, the PSRB chair stated, \u201c[W]e would ask that you return to the Board for approval of the Post-Prison Supervision plan for a period of two years.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b73-6\">Read in isolation, PSRB\u2019s request that petitioner return to PSRB \u201cfor approval of the Post-Prison Supervision plan\u201d could imply that PSRB retained its ability to approve or reject the conditions of post-prison supervision. In context, however, it is apparent that PSRB\u2019s \u201capproval\u201d of the plan was not so broad. Indeed, <em>no one </em>\u2014 including PSRB\u2014 understood it that way at the time of the hearing. The state and petitioner left the hearing under the impression that their agreement had been approved as proposed, and they proceeded on that assumption. On May 6, 2008, petitioner, pursuant to the terms of the agreement, pleaded guilty in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>the trial court; at that time, petitioner\u2019s counsel represented to the trial court \u2014 without any objection from the state\u2014 that, under their agreement,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b74-4\">\u201c[PSRB] can ask [BOPPS] to add conditions, but if [BOPPS] does not add the conditions that PSRB wants, they cannot revoke [petitioner] because of that. In other words, they may ask them to force [petitioner] to live in a group home. If [BOPPS] does not put that as a condition, they can\u2019t revoke him just because of that.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b74-5\">Most importantly, though, PSRB\u2019s May 2008 final order reflects the fact that PSRB itself understood that it had approved the agreement <em>proposed by the parties, </em>and not some modified version of that agreement. The order states that PSRB \u201caccept [ed] as findings of fact the stipulations of the parties as set forth by the parties at the outset of the hearing.\u201d Those stipulations \u2014 \u201cat the outset of the hearing\u201d \u2014 were the stipulations between the state and petitioner, which specifically included the parties\u2019 agreement that the state\u2019s attorney would ask PSRB to approve petitioner\u2019s conditional release after he served his prison term, and that petitioner would serve that conditional release as a post-prison supervision term under conditions <em>set by BOPPS. </em>Furthermore, the 2008 order explicitly recited that, pursuant to the parties\u2019 agreement,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b74-6\">\u201c[PSRB] could ask [BOPPS] to consider conditions [PSRB] might think were appropriate in addition to the standard conditions that [BOPPS] would require but that [PSRB] <em>will accept the conditions set by [BOPPS] unless [petitioner\u2019s] circumstances or behavior had substantially changed from the date of this order.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b74-7\">(Emphasis added.) Finally, and most importantly, the order recited that the proposed agreement \u2014 including that PSRB \u201cwill accept the conditions set by [BOPPS]\u201d \u2014 \u201cwould only be effective if PSRB were to agree to it <em>in its </em>entirety.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Nowhere in the order is there any suggestion that PSRB agreed to something other than the entirety of the parties\u2019 proposed agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-8\">Based on the record before us, there is no factual support for PSRB\u2019s finding that, at the 2008 hearing, it had approved an agreement whereby PSRB reserved the right <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>to reject the supervision conditions set by BOPPS. Rather, PSRB explicitly agreed to \u201caccept the conditions set by [BOPPS] unless [petitioner\u2019s] circumstances or behavior had substantially changed from the date of this order.\u201d Thus, PSRB\u2019s order denying petitioner\u2019s request for conditional release is not supported by substantial evidence, and we therefore reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-4\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b65-6\"> Petitioner argues, alternatively, that PSRB lacked substantial evidence to find that petitioner ever suffered from a mental disease or defect subject to PSRB\u2019s jurisdiction or that petitioner is a danger to others because of his mental condition. We reject those arguments without discussion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b65-7\"> Petitioner had several cases pending against the state, including at least two mandamus actions in Marion County Circuit Court, at least two appeals in habeas corpus cases in the Court of Appeals, and a Court of Appeals case regarding PSRB\u2019s prior ruling.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b70-6\"> BOPPS\u2019s Order of Supervision Conditions provided, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b70-7\">\u201c[Petitioner] is hereby released.
