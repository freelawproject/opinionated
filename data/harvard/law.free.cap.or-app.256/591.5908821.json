J.</author>\n<p id=\"b616-4\">Wife appeals a dissolution judgment, challenging the trial court\u2019s property division. In particular, wife quarrels with two components of the trial court\u2019s property division. First, wife contends that the equalizing payment included in the judgment was too large based on the trial court\u2019s incorrect \u201cfinding that the parties had a $33,600 debt on their home.\u201d Wife also asserts that the \u201ccourt erred in ordering a [Qualified Domestic Relations Order (QDRO)] giving to husband $21,500 from wife\u2019s retirement\u201d accounts. For the reasons set forth below, we vacate and remand the property division and otherwise affirm the dissolution judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-5\">The background facts are undisputed. The parties married in September 2002 and separated in January 2008. Although they have children from previous relationships, the parties have no joint children. At the time of the marriage, wife owned a home valued at approximately $175,000 and subject to $70,000 of debt. One issue in the divorce was the division of the parties\u2019 property, including the home and several retirement accounts, as well as debts consisting of credit card balances, a mortgage, and a home equity line of credit.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-6\">At the end of the trial, the court awarded the house to wife and announced that the equity in the house at the time of the marriage was premarital property to which wife was entitled. However, the court determined that the appreciation in the house during the marriage should be divided between the parties:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b616-7\">\u201c[T]he fair market value of the house in 2002 was [$] 175,000, had $70,000 of obligation wrapped up in it, leaving a fair\u2014 equity of $105,000. The fair market value today is $260,000, with a $33,600 obligation. So, really, the \u2014 today\u2019s equity is [$]226,400. We take from that the [$] 105,000 that Wife had before the date of marriage, leaving a divisible portion of [$] 121,400. So that means, Husband\u2019s going to start off with [$] 60,700 out of the house.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b616-8\">The court also concluded that several credit card balances were joint obligations and that wife had improperly taken and used certain funds while the parties were separated. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>Based on all of those findings, the court concluded \u201cthat Husband\u2019s entitled to Judgment against Wife in the amount of $80,000.\u201d The dissolution judgment ultimately entered by the trial court contained an equalizing award of that amount.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-4\">With respect to the retirement funds, the court determined that the marital portion of the funds would be equalized through a QDRO. The court did not make a finding regarding the value of the marital portion of the retirement funds. After the trial, but before the entry of the dissolution judgment, the court held additional hearings in which the parties addressed the division of the retirement funds. The parties presented the court with differing amounts that they argued constituted the marital portion of the retirement accounts to be divided. The court reiterated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b617-5\">\u201cI\u2019m not looking at who made contributions, when, where, how, except premarital. So if it\u2019s premarital, I\u2019m going to pull that portion out. If there\u2019s a growth of the premarital portion, there\u2019s growth of the premarital portion, and that\u2019s going to be just lumped in with the rest of it because there\u2019s no real way of ascertaining what\u2019s growth and diminishment, and that sort of thing, without an \u2014 without having a\u2014 a headache.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b617-6\">* * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b617-7\">\u201c*** So, I\u2019m just subtracting out those dollars and it should be the simplest thing in the world to say, \u2018Well, on this date I have this much in the account before I got married and then that part comes out to me.\u2019\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b617-8\">At a later hearing regarding the form of judgment, the division of the retirement accounts was discussed again. The court stated that it had determined \u201cthat husband\u2019s premarital E*TRADE and * * * rollover IRA was $23,000.\u201d Pursuant to that finding, \u201cthe first [$] 23,000 came out of the E*TRADE and went to Husband; the rest was divided 50/50. So 50/50, rather than a dollar amount.\u201d The court instructed husband\u2019s attorney to prepare the judgment. The dissolution judgment submitted by husband\u2019s attorney and entered by the trial court provided, as part of the property awarded to husband, that husband would receive \u201c[h]is retirement account and an equalization of [wife]\u2019s retirement account <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>***. The equalizing amount shall be $21,500. Said amount shall be transferred pursuant to a QDRO, the cost of which shall be equally divided between the parties.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b618-4\">As noted, in her first assignment of error, wife asserts that the trial court\u2019s equalizing award of $80,000 is too large. Specifically, according to wife, that equalizing award \u201cis predicated on the court having used $33,600 as the amount of the parties\u2019 mortgage\u201d; however, wife contends that it was undisputed that the mortgage at the time of trial was approximately twice that amount. Husband first responds that wife\u2019s contention is not preserved and that, therefore, we should not address it on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-5\">Ordinarily, this court will not consider an issue on appeal unless it was first presented to the trial court. ORAP 5.45(1). The preservation requirement is designed to apprise the trial court of a party\u2019s position so that the court can consider it, to avoid surprise and unfairness to the opposing party, and to foster full development of the record. <em>Peeples v. </em>Lampert, 345 Or 209, 219-20, 191 P3d 637 (2008). The \u201cdetermination whether a particular issue was preserved for appeal is a \u2018practical one\u2019; it will depend on whether the policies behind the preservation requirement \u2014 -judicial efficiency, full development of the record, and procedural fairness to the parties and the trial court \u2014 are met in an individual case.\u201d <em>Charles v. Palomo, </em>347 Or 695, 700, 227 P3d 737 (2010) (quoting <em>State v. Parkins, </em>346 Or 333, 340-41, 211 P3d 262 (2009)). We will consider \u201can issue advanced by a party on [appeal] as long as that party raised the issue below with enough particularity to assure that the trial court was able to \u2018identify its alleged error\u2019 so as to \u2018consider and correct the error immediately, if correction is warranted.\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>State v. Wyatt, </em>331 Or 335, 343, 15 P3d 22 (2000)). Parties are not, however, \u201crequired to repeat their objections after the trial court has ruled against them.\u201d Id. at 701-02.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-6\">Here, in husband\u2019s view, wife failed to preserve the asserted error because \u201cduring the seven months following the arising of the alleged error, Wife referred to the alleged error \u2014 if at all \u2014 only in the most general terms [.]\u201d Wife responds that her submissions to the court set forth the correct dollar amount of debt on the house, and, in addition, in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>his own submission, husband \u201cagreed with those numbers.\u201d Under the circumstances, she asserts that the alleged error was sufficiently preserved.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-4\">Wife presented evidence at trial that the debt on the parties\u2019 home was approximately $68,000. However, as noted, in its factual findings the trial court stated that the debt on the house at the time of trial was $33,600. After the court announced its ruling, as husband notes, wife did not immediately assert that the trial court\u2019s finding regarding the debt on the house was incorrect. However, after the trial and before the judgment was entered, wife made submissions to the court that set forth the correct amount of debt on the house at the time of trial.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In one submission, she noted that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b619-5\">\u201c[t]he Court\u2019s determination was that the 2009 fair market value of the house was $260,000. After subtracting the 2009 loan debt in the amount of $67,027.32 from the $260,000, fair market value, the 2009 equity in the home was $192,972.62.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b619-6\">Additionally, in another document, wife stated that the \u201ccurrent equity\u201d in the house was $192,972.68. Wife also submitted calculation sheets and a bank statement, which the court admitted into evidence, that set forth the 2009 loan debt on the house as being between $67,000 and $68,000. As wife points out, in his own post-trial (but prejudgment) submission to the trial court, husband also set forth the value of the house at the time of trial as $260,000 and the debt as $68,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-7\">Although neither party specifically informed the court after trial that its finding regarding the debt on the house was incorrect, their post-trial submissions set forth the correct number. Wife did specifically assert to the trial court that its calculation of the premarital equity in the house was incorrect. Moreover, as wife observes, with respect to the amount of debt on the house at the time of trial, both parties appeared to be in agreement regarding the correct amount, and the documents and calculations <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>that they submitted to the court set forth and relied on that amount.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-4\">Under the circumstances, we conclude that wife sufficiently preserved her claim of error. She presented evidence regarding the debt on the house at the time of trial. Furthermore, after the court made a finding at odds with that evidence, wife (and husband), though not necessarily required to do so, submitted additional materials to the court both stating and demonstrating the amount of debt on the house. In our view, the policies underlying the preservation requirement were served in this case. The issue that wife seeks to have us address on appeal was put before the trial court such that the court should have been able to identify and correct the alleged error.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-5\">On the merits, wife contends that there is no evidence to support the trial court\u2019s finding of $33,600 in debt on the house at the time of trial and that the equalizing award was based, in part, on that erroneous finding.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Husband counters that the trial court did not base its judgment on any specific calculation and points to other circumstances that he contends support the equalizing award. We agree with wife.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-6\">The court, as noted, specifically found that wife\u2019s equity in the house at the time of the marriage was $105,000. It found further that the fair market value at the time of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>trial was \u201c$260,000, with a $33,600 obligation.\u201d However, there is no evidence in the record to support the latter figure. Rather, all the evidence (and both parties\u2019 submissions after the trial) demonstrates that the debt on the house was about twice the amount found by the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-4\">Given its incorrect understanding of the debt, the court concluded that the equity in the house at the time of trial was $226, 400, and then subtracted from that amount \u201cthe [$] 105,000 that Wife had before the date of marriage, leaving a divisible portion of [$] 121,400. So that means, Husband\u2019s going to start off with [$]60,700 out of the house.\u201d That calculation formed the basis for a substantial portion of the $80,000 equalizing award. Given that the trial court\u2019s finding underlying the equalizing award regarding the debt on the house is not supported by evidence in the record, we conclude that it is appropriate to remand the case for the trial court to determine a just and proper division of property in view of the actual amount of equity in the house at the time of trial. <em>Kunze and Kunze, </em>337 Or 122, 135, 92 P3d 100 (2004) (under ORS 107.105(1)(f), the court must determine a division of marital property that is \u201cjust and proper in all the circumstances\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b621-5\">As noted, in her second assignment of error, wife challenges the portion of the property division in which the trial court awarded husband $21,500 from wife\u2019s retirement accounts. She notes that the trial court ruled that each party would receive his or her own retirement funds and that the marital portion of the retirement accounts was to be equalized between the parties. However, according to wife, the portion of the written judgment that awards husband $21,500 from wife\u2019s retirement account is entirely inconsistent with that ruling. Furthermore, she asserts that the court made that order \u201cby signing a judgment two days after it was submitted by husband\u2019s attorney, (without giving wife\u2019s attorney any opportunity to object), and without at any time previously telling the parties that it was doing anything other than what it ordered from the bench * *</p>\n<p id=\"b621-6\">Husband responds that wife failed to preserve the error. With respect to the substance of wife\u2019s argument, husband does not appear to dispute that the portion of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>judgment relating to the QDRO is inconsistent with the trial court\u2019s stated intentions regarding division of the retirement accounts. Instead, he asserts that the court could have decided not to award wife any of his retirement accounts because, in his view, they lost \u201cvirtually all of their pre-marital value during the marriage.\u201d Furthermore, according to husband, \u201cbecause Wife\u2019s * * * account, acquired during the marriage and funded by joint funds, was the only account to grow, and was worth $44,000 or $55,000 * * * the judgment correctly awarded Husband half of it.\u201d Because we have determined, as discussed above, that the property division portion of the judgment must be vacated and remanded, we need not address the parties\u2019 contentions regarding the retirement accounts. The trial court, on remand, must determine a just and proper division of property under all the circumstances and will be able to consider an appropriate division of the parties\u2019 retirement accounts as part of that determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-4\">Property division vacated and remanded; otherwise affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b619-8\"> The parties submitted letters to the court, along with additional documents. The trial court admitted those submissions into evidence and they are part of the record on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b620-7\"> As husband points out, wife does not request <em>de novo </em>review in this case. <em>See </em>ORS 19.415(3)(b) (\u201cUpon an appeal in an equitable action or proceeding other than an appeal from a judgment in a proceeding for the termination of parental rights, the Court of Appeals, acting in its sole discretion, may try the cause anew upon the record or make one or more factual findings anew upon the record.\u201d); ORAP 5.40(8)(a) (\u201cIn those proceedings in which the Court of Appeals has discretion to try the cause anew on the record and the appellant seeks the have the court exercise that discretion, the appellant shall concisely state the reasons why the court should do so.\u201d). Given that wife does not seek <em>de novo </em>review and in light of the \u201cpresumption against the exercise of discretion\u201d to conduct such a review, ORAP 5.40(8)(c), we review the factual findings at issue in this case to determine whether they are supported by any evidence. <em>See Morton and </em>Morton, 252 Or App 525, 527, 287 P3d 1227 (2012) (\u201c[W]e are bound by the trial court\u2019s express and implicit factual findings if they are supported by any evidence in the record * * *.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b620-8\">Husband suggests that the court\u2019s oral remarks regarding the fair market value of and obligations on the house do not constitute factual findings. However, the court specifically characterized its discussion of the equity in the house as \u201cfindings of fact.\u201d Thus, we reject husband\u2019s position on that point and treat the court\u2019s determinations as factual findings for purposes of our review.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
