The trial court concluded that the agreement created an appurtenant easement in favor of plaintiffs or, alternatively, that plaintiffs have an implied easement. Defendant appeals, contending first that the \u201ccourt erred in interpreting the [agreement] as [creating] an appurtenant easement in favor of plaintiffs.\u201d Specifically, defendant argues that the agreement unambiguously granted only a personal <em>license </em>to the Hopkinses and that, even if the agreement did create an easement in their favor, the easement was not appurtenant. Defendant also contends that the court erred in alternatively concluding that plaintiffs have an implied easement.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> For the reasons set forth below, we conclude that the agreement unambiguously created an appurtenant easement granting plaintiffs the right to use, service, and maintain the pipeline. Accordingly, we affirm.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b418-5\">The relevant facts are undisputed. The Busbys originally owned what is now defendant\u2019s property, which lies on the south bank of the Umpqua River. That property consists of tax lot 400 and tax lot 500. Mr. Busby also owned two parcels that lie south of defendant\u2019s property. Those two parcels were created as the result of a land partition initiated by Mr. Busby in 1998; what is now plaintiffs\u2019 property\u2014 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>the western parcel \u2014 was designated as Parcel 1 of Land Partition 1998-0103, and a second property \u2014 the eastern parcel \u2014 was designated as Parcel 2 of Land Partition 1998-0103.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-4\">In November 1998, Mr. Busby deeded Parcel 1 of Land Partition 1998-0103 to plaintiffs\u2019 predecessors-in-interest, the Hopkinses. That parcel had (and still has) certificated water rights from the Umpqua River. Mr. Hopkins was familiar with the parcel because, as the Busbys\u2019 ranch hand, he had irrigated it using the Busbys\u2019 irrigation pipeline. At the time of the sale, that pipeline ran from the Umpqua River through the Busbys\u2019 property (tax lots 400 and 500) and Mr. Busby\u2019s remaining parcel (Parcel 2 of Land Partition 1998-0103) to the Hopkinses\u2019 parcel.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-5\">About four months after the sale, in March 1999, the Busbys and the Hopkinses entered into the following \u201cIrrigation Pipeline and Access Agreement\u201d (IPA Agreement):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b419-6\">\u201cThis agreement is entered into this 10th day of March 1999 by and between James Scott Busby and Margaret Mary Busby, hereafter referred to as Owners, and Jamie Lee Hopkins and Suzanne Kay Hopkins, hereafter referred to as Users.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b419-7\">\u201cWhereas Owners shall give Users a non-exclusive right to service and maintain an existing underground irrigation pipeline and facility which services User\u2019s property known as Parcel 1 of Land Partition 1998-0103, Partition Platt records of Douglas County, Oregon. Users shall have the rights to service and maintain the existing underground pipeline facilities through Owner\u2019s Parcel 2 of Land Partition 1998-0103, and Parcels 1 and 2, also known as T-25 R7 S28, Tax Lot 400 and Tax Lot 500.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b419-8\">\u201cThe access through Parcel 1 and Parcel 2 (Tax Lot 400 and Tax Lot 500) shall be limited to a 15 ft. non-exclusive easement, which will run North to South between the two parcels. Five feet of said easement will be on the Easterly property line of Parcel 2 and 10 feet shall be on the Westerly property line of Parcel 1.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b419-9\">One month later, in April 1999, Mr. Busby deeded Parcel 2 of Land Partition 1998-0103 to Miller and Millsap. That same month, the Busbys granted Miller and Millsap <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>an easement over the Busbys\u2019 property. Several years later, in March 2005, the Busbys sold tax lots 400 and 500 to defendant. The Hopkinses then sold their parcel to plaintiffs in May 2006, and a dispute arose over whether plaintiffs were entitled \u2014 pursuant to the IPA Agreement \u2014 to use, service, and maintain the irrigation pipeline running through defendant\u2019s property.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-4\">As noted, plaintiffs brought an action for declaratory relief, seeking, among other things, a declaration that the IPA Agreement unambiguously created an appurtenant easement granting plaintiffs the right to use, service, and maintain the irrigation pipeline running through defendant\u2019s property. Defendant responded that the lPA Agreement unambiguously created only <em>\u201ca </em>permission, a license, between Busby and Hopkins allowing Hopkins * * *, who is described as the user in the document, to use the pipeline for his property. It simply doesn\u2019t meet the test of an easement.\u201d Alternatively, defendant argued that, even if the IPA Agreement did create an easement in favor of the Hopkinses, it was not appurtenant\u2014 that is, it did not transfer by conveyance to plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-5\">The trial court concluded that, \u201cunder the terms of [the IPA Agreement],\u201d plaintiffs have an \u201ceasement to use, service and maintain the existing westerly pipeline and facility over the Jones Property for the purpose of supplying water to the Worth Property.\u201d Defendant appeals, largely reiterating her arguments before the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-6\">As framed by defendant, the issues on appeal are as follows: (1) whether the IPA Agreement created an express easement in favor of the Hopkinses and, if so, (2) whether that easement is appurtenant such that it was transferred to plaintiffs by conveyance. Those questions require that we interpret the IPA Agreement. In doing so, \u201cour objective is to ascertain the meaning that most likely was intended by the parties who entered into it.\u201d <em>Connall v. Felton, </em>225 Or App 266, 271, 201 P3d 219, <em>rev den, </em>346 Or 257 (2009) (citing ORS 42.240 (\u201cIn the construction of an instrument the intention of the parties is to be pursued if possible[.]\u201d)); <em>see also Tipperman v. Tsiatsos, </em>327 Or 539, 964 P2d 1015 (1998) (construing deed); <em>Yogman v. Parrott, </em>325 Or 358, 937 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>P2d 1019 (1997) (construing contract). \u201cWe look first to the language of the instrument itself and consider its text in the context of the document as a whole. If the text\u2019s meaning is unambiguous, the analysis ends, and we interpret the provision\u2019s meaning as a matter of law.\u201d <em>Connall, </em>225 Or App at 272. \u201c[A] contractual provision is ambiguous if it is capable of more than one sensible and reasonable interpretation; a term is unambiguous if its meaning is so clear as to preclude doubt by a reasonable person.\u201d <em>Peace River Seed Co-Op v. Proseeds Marketing, </em>253 Or App 704, 724, 293 P3d 1058 (2012) (internal quotation marks omitted). Furthermore, we are mindful that, \u201c[i]n construing an instrument, the circumstances under which it was made, including the situation of the subject and of the parties, may be shown so that the judge is placed in the position of those whose language the judge is interpreting.\u201d ORS 42.220; <em>see also Connall, </em>225 Or App at 272 (\u201cTo determine whether a term in a document is ambiguous, the court can consider evidence of the circumstances surrounding its execution.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b421-4\">With that framework in mind, we first consider whether, as the trial court concluded, the IPA Agreement unambiguously created an express easement. As noted, defendant argues that there is \u201cno indication that the pipeline agreement was intended as anything more than a license for the Hopkins family to access the water irrigation pipeline while they owned [the property], which was sold to them by Mr. Busby.\u201d Plaintiffs respond that the use of the word \u201ceasement\u201d twice in the IPA Agreement unambiguously demonstrates that the \u201c\u2018right\u2019 being granted is intended to be in the nature of an easement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b421-5\">We conclude that the IPA Agreement unambiguously created a right in the nature of an easement. \u201cAn easement is a right in one person to do certain acts on land of another.\u201d <em>Bloomfield v. Weakland, </em>224 Or App 433, 445, 199 P3d 318 (2008), <em>rev den, </em>346 Or 115 (2009) (citing <em>German Savings &amp; Loan Soc. v. Gordon, </em>54 Or 147, 150, 102 P 736 (1909)). \u201cAn express easement is one expressed clearly in writing containing plain and direct language evincing the grantor\u2019s intent to create a right in the nature of an easement.\u201d <em>Id. </em>As noted, the second paragraph of the IPA Agreement provides, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>in part, that \u201cOwners shall give Users a non-exclusive <em>right </em>to service and maintain an existing underground irrigation pipeline and facility which services User\u2019s property known as Parcel 1 of Land Partition 1998-0103.\u201d (Emphasis added.) It further provides that \u201cUsers shall have the rights to service and maintain the existing underground pipeline facilities <em>through </em>* * * Tax Lot 400 and Tax Lot 500.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Accordingly, the IPA Agreement plainly granted \u201cUsers\u201d a right \u201cto do certain acts\u201d (to use, service, and maintain the pipeline and facility) \u201con land of another\u201d (tax lots 400 and 500). <em>See Bloomfield, </em>224 Or App at 445.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-4\">Further, examination of those provisions in the context of the document as a whole provides additional support for the trial court\u2019s conclusion that the IPA Agreement created an easement in favor of the Hopkinses. The third paragraph of the IPA Agreement provides that \u201c[t]he access through *** Tax Lot 400 and Tax Lot 500[] shall be limited to a 15 ft. non-exclusive <em>easement[.]\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) That provision plainly creates an easement granting the Hopkinses the right to access certain parts of tax lots 400 and 500 in order to effectuate the rights referenced in the second paragraph of the agreement \u2014 that is, the \u201cright [s] to service and maintain an existing underground irrigation pipeline and facility which services User\u2019s property\u201d across tax lots 400 and 500.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Put simply, the fact that the agreement expressly creates an easement allowing access to certain parts of tax lots 400 and 500 makes clear that the parties intended that the partially conterminous \u201cright [s] to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>service and maintain the existing underground irrigation pipeline and facility\u201d also be of the same duration and in the nature of an easement. Read together, the two paragraphs are not \u201ccapable of more than one sensible and reasonable interpretation.\u201d <em>See Peace River Seed Co-Op, </em>253 Or App at 724. That is, the alternate interpretation \u2014 that the IPA Agreement granted the Hopkinses an easement to access the pipeline but only a revocable license to use, service, and maintain that pipeline \u2014 is untenable given the document\u2019s plain terms and the circumstances underlying its formation.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-4\">Defendant asserts that the IPA Agreement cannot be interpreted to have created an easement in favor of the Hopkinses because \u201cthe document title itself does not state that the agreement is to be an easement\u201d and \u201cthere is no language stating that an easement is conveyed or granted.\u201d That argument is not well taken. Defendant points to no authority establishing that certain words are <em>required </em>to create an express easement; rather, as noted, \u201c[a]n express easement is one expressed clearly in writing containing plain and direct language evincing the grantor\u2019s intent to create a right in the nature of an easement.\u201d <em>Bloomfield, </em>224 Or App at 445; <em>see id. </em>at 446 (finding an express easement where the plat \u201cdoes not expressly describe an \u2018easement\u2019\u201d). As illustrated above, the plain text of the IPA Agreement meets that standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-5\">We must still consider defendant\u2019s argument that, even if the IPA Agreement created an easement in favor of the Hopkinses, that easement was not appurtenant and, accordingly, was not transferred to plaintiffs by conveyance. An appurtenant easement \u201cis one where the land of one person, the servient tenement, is subjected to some use or burden for the benefit of the lands of another person, the dominant tenement.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 445. \u201cThe right is enjoyed by the owner of the dominant estate by virtue of his ownership of the land. If the dominant estate is sold or otherwise transferred to another, the easement over the servient land is transferred as well.\u201d <em>Braat v. Aylett, </em>278 Or 549, 552, 564 P2d 1030 (1977). \u201cThere is a strong preference for finding that an easement is appurtenant, especially where the deed specifically refers to property that could be the dominant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>estate.\u201d <em>Verzeano v. Carpenter, </em>108 Or App 258, 261, 815 P2d 1275 (1991), <em>rev den, </em>312 Or 589 (1992) (citing <em>Hall v. Meyer, </em>270 Or 335, 339, 527 P2d 722 (1974)).</p>\n<p id=\"b424-4\">Defendant argues that there is \u201cno language showing an intent that the easement be permanent, assignable, or anything other than personal to the Hopkinses.\u201d Our case law, however, does not require specific language demonstrating an intent that an easement be appurtenant.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Instead, that intent is assumed in the first instance. As noted, the preference is for finding that an easement is appurtenant\u2014 especially where the dominant estate is identified \u2014 unless specific language demonstrates a contrary intent. <em>See Hall, </em>270 Or at 339 (noting the preference for finding that an easement is appurtenant and stating that, in that case, \u201c [t] he reservation [did] not contain language sufficient to override that preference\u201d (footnote omitted)); <em>see also Verzeano, </em>108 Or App at 261 (concluding that an easement is appurtenant where, \u201c[although the property is not precisely defined,\u201d the language of the conveyance is clear that the property was intended to be the dominant estate). Here, defendant has identified no language demonstrating a contrary intent. More importantly, the IPA Agreement expressly refers to the dominant estate: Parcel 1 of Land Partition 1998-0103. Thus, consistently with the \u201cstrong preference\u201d described above, we conclude that the easement is appurtenant.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-5\">In sum, we conclude that the IPA Agreement unambiguously created an appurtenant easement granting plaintiffs <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>the right to use, service, and maintain the pipeline. Accordingly, the trial court did not err.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b418-6\"> Plaintiffs Miller and Millsap, who also own property adjacent to that of defendant, are not parties on appeal. Accordingly, all subsequent references to \u201cplaintiffs\u201d in this opinion refer only to Allen and Kathy Worth.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b418-7\"> Defendant also requests that we exercise our discretion under ORS 19.415(3)(b) to review this case <em>de novo. </em>To the extent that the underlying claims are equitable in nature, we decline to do so. <em>See </em>ORAP 5.40(8)(c) (providing that we exercise <em>de novo </em>review \u201conly in exceptional cases\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b418-8\"> Given our disposition of the case, we do not address defendant\u2019s contention that the trial court erred in concluding that plaintiffs have an implied easement.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b422-5\"> Defendant argues that the word \u201ceasement\u201d in the IPA Agreement refers to \u201can actual easement agreement\u201d that the Busbys executed two weeks <em>later </em>with Miller and Millsap, \u201cgranting to them an easement for the installation of a separate irrigation pipeline over what is now Defendant Jones\u2019s property.\u201d In defendant\u2019s view, the IPA Agreement granted the Hopkinses permission to access tax lots 400 and 500 at the location where the Busbys later granted an express easement to Miller and Millsap. To the extent that defendant is arguing that the term \u201ceasement\u201d in the third paragraph of the IPA Agreement is ambiguous, we disagree. The third paragraph clearly provides that the right of access is \u201climited to a 15 ft. non-exclusive easement\u201d and then describes the location of that easement. Parole evidence may only be considered to determine whether a contractual provision is ambiguous when that evidence relates to the \u201ccircumstances underlying the formation of [the] contract.\u201d <em>Sollars v. City of Milwaukie, </em>222 Or App 384, 388, 193 P3d 75 (2008), <em>rev den, </em>346 Or 184 (2009). Here, evidence that the Busbys and Miller and Millsap executed an agreement creating an express easement to install a separate pipeline <em>weeks after </em>the IPA Agreement was signed does not relate to the circumstances of the IPA Agreement\u2019s formation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b424-6\"> Defendant relies on <em>Hunnell v. Roseburg Resources Co., </em>183 Or App 228, 51 P3d 680, <em>rev den, </em>335 Or 114 (2002), in advancing her argument that a trial court errs \u201cin finding [that] an easement was intended to pass to successors and assigns where those words were not so stated in the document.\u201d <em>Hunnell </em>does not stand for that proposition. In <em>Hunnell, </em>we were tasked with interpreting an easement that provided that a company and \u201cits successors and assigns\u201d owned the easement \u201cfor and during such period of time as said [company] shall have ownership of any interest in or control over any timber [or] timberlands ***.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 232 (internal quotation marks omitted; second brackets in <em>Hunnell). </em>The trial court concluded that the easement did not end with the dissolution of the company, and we reversed, concluding that the instrument created an easement for a limited term and that the easement therefore ended when the company no longer owned or controlled the timber or timberland and did not pass to the company\u2019s successor-in-interest. <em>Id. </em>at 234. Here, defendant has identified no language in the IPA Agreement that may be construed to create an easement only for a limited term, and, accordingly, <em>Hunnell </em>does not apply.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
