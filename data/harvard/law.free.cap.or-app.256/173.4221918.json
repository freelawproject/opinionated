J.</author>\n<p id=\"b198-4\">Defendant was convicted of four counts of rape in the third degree, ORS 163.355; five counts of sexual abuse in the second degree, ORS 163.425; and one count of unlawful delivery of marijuana, ORS 475.860, all arising out of conduct occurring over several days involving two minor female victims. On appeal, he raises nine assignments of error. In the first four, he argues that the court abused its discretion in denying his motions for a mistrial after the jury heard four statements from prosecution witnesses from which it could infer that defendant had engaged in prior uncharged conduct involving sex with minors. According to defendant, even though the court sustained objections to three of the statements and gave the jury curative instructions, the instructions could not cure the prejudice. With respect to the statement that the court admitted, defendant argues in a fifth assignment of error that it was not only grounds for mistrial, but also that it should have been excluded because its probative value was significantly outweighed by its potential for undue prejudice. In a sixth assignment of error, defendant urges us to overrule a recent precedent, <em>State v. Stamper, </em>197 Or App 413, 106 P3d 172, <em>rev den, </em>339 Or 230 (2005). We reject that assignment without discussion.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In the seventh and eighth assignments, he maintains that the court erred in allowing a nonunanimous verdict on one of the counts. We have rejected that argument in numerous cases and we do so again. And in an unpreserved <em>pro se </em>assignment of error, he maintains that his sentence (life, without possibility of parole) plainly violates the Oregon and United States Constitutions. We reject that assignment without discussion as well. On the evidentiary assignments, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-5\">Because the jury found defendant guilty, we state the background facts in the light most favorable to the state. <em>State v. Cervantes, </em>319 Or 121, 125, 873 P2d 316 (1994). Defendant, who was 28 at the time of the crimes, met the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>two victims, M (then 16 years old) and N (then 15), after they had run away from a foster home. Defendant provided them with marijuana, which they smoked together. He then offered to pay the victims $200 to engage in sex with him, and they agreed. He took the victims into a brushy area of a park and had vaginal intercourse with each of them twice. All three then went to the home of defendant\u2019s friend, where they stayed for several days. There, the victims drank alcohol, smoked marijuana and cigarettes, used methamphetamine, and had sexual intercourse with defendant and his friend.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-3\">The victims began to feel anxious about staying with defendant and his friend. Despite their expressed unwillingness, defendant had vaginal intercourse one more time with each victim, and anal intercourse with M. On the third or fourth morning, the victims left the house without defendant. Later, they reported defendant\u2019s conduct to the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-4\">Defendant was charged by indictment with the above-described offenses and appeals his convictions after a jury trial. We first address issues relating to the court\u2019s denial of defendant\u2019s four motions for mistrial. At a pretrial hearing, the state informed the court that it wanted to introduce evidence of defendant\u2019s history of sex crimes involving a minor. The court ruled that the criminal record would be admissible only for impeachment and only if defendant testified. Defendant did not testify. However, four times during the course of trial, the prosecutor or a state witness made reference to facts that defendant contends allowed the jury to infer that he had a criminal history that included sex offenses against minors. We address each of those.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-5\">During his opening statement, the prosecutor told the jury that defendant had acknowledged to a detective \u201cthat he\u2019s got a sex problem and that he needs help,\u201d and that he \u201cknows he shouldn\u2019t have been talking to minors.\u201d Defense counsel immediately objected and moved to strike the statements, because there was no evidence of an admission by defendant to a <em>sex </em>problem. The court agreed, struck the statement, and instructed the jury to disregard it. Defense counsel also moved for a mistrial, on the ground that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>the prosecutor\u2019s incorrect characterization of the evidence resulted in incurable prejudice, because the jury would infer from the statements that defendant was a convicted sex offender; the statement, in other words, would have the effect of allowing the state to introduce evidence that the court had already ruled inadmissible. The trial court denied the motion for mistrial but provided an instruction to the jury telling it that the prosecutor\u2019s statement was not evidence, that it was not true, and that the jury must disregard it.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The prosecutor also corrected himself, and apologized to the jury: \u201cI misspoke. I apologize. I misinterpreted a police report, I read it wrong.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b200-4\">Later, the state called Johnson, defendant\u2019s former roommate, as a witness. The prosecutor asked Johnson if he had prior felony convictions. Johnson testified that he had a prior conviction for a sex crime. The prosecutor then asked Johnson if he had been convicted of that offense before he and defendant roomed together. Johnson replied \u201cyes,\u201d and volunteered that \u201chim and I met in treatment.\u201d Defendant objected and moved to strike the witness\u2019s testimony. The trial court granted the motion to strike and instructed the jury to disregard the testimony. Defendant then moved for a mistrial, arguing that the witness\u2019s testimony, in combination with the prosecutor\u2019s earlier statement, allowed the jury to infer that defendant was a sex offender who had been in sex-offender treatment. Defense counsel asserted that the combined effect of the statement and the testimony had caused defendant incurable prejudice. The trial court denied the motion for a mistrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>Later, the prosecutor asked a state\u2019s witness, Detective Brown, if defendant had \u201cacknowledged that he shouldn\u2019t be talking to minors.\u201d The witness answered, \u201cHe did.\u201d Once again, defense counsel objected, moved to strike the testimony, and argued that allowing the jury to hear that defendant had acknowledged that he shouldn\u2019t be speaking with minors would allow jurors to infer that defendant was a sex offender, contrary to the exclusion of that evidence. Defense counsel argued that Brown\u2019s statement, especially in the context of the previous statements, was prejudicial and required the granting of a mistrial. The prosecutor responded that the evidence of defendant\u2019s admission that he should not be talking to minors showed defendant\u2019s knowledge of the victims\u2019 ages and was therefore relevant to an element of the charges against him. The trial court did not strike the testimony this time, and denied defendant\u2019s motion for a mistrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-4\">Finally, later in the trial, the prosecutor asked a state witness, Detective Lidey, whether he spoke to defendant after he was arrested. Lidey testified that he had and that he had urged defendant to take responsibility for his misdeeds, and that defendant \u201cwas very receptive of that and acknowledged that he had * * * a problem and he needed to change his ways.\u201d Defendant objected to the testimony and moved to strike it. The trial court sustained the objection and struck the question and answer. Defendant did not request a curative instruction, but the court instructed the jury to disregard the testimony. Defendant again moved for a mistrial, asserting that Lidey\u2019s testimony was prejudicial and, in light of the prior statements, was highly prejudicial, because it allowed the jury to infer that defendant was a convicted sex offender, contrary to the judge\u2019s exclusion of defendant\u2019s criminal record. The trial court once again denied the motion, explaining that the prior statements had been excluded and that the court did not find Lidey\u2019s testimony to be prejudicial.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-5\">In his first through fourth assignments of error, defendant contends that the trial court erred in denying his four motions for a mistrial. A motion for a mistrial is addressed to the sound discretion of the trial court, because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>the trial court is in the best position to assess and remedy any potential prejudice to the defendant. <em>State v. Farrar, </em>309 Or 132, 164, 786 P2d 161 (1990); <em>State v. Simonsen, </em>329 Or 288, 300, 986 P2d 566 (1999). We review the trial court\u2019s denial of the motion for a mistrial for an abuse of discretion. State <em>v. Bowen, </em>340 Or 487, 508, 135 P3d 272 (2006). Defendant does not contend that the prosecutor\u2019s comments or the questioning of the witnesses amounted to prosecutorial misconduct. However, even if the prosecutor\u2019s conduct was improper \u2014 an issue we do not address \u2014 a trial court does not abuse its discretion in denying a mistrial unless the effect is to deny the defendant a fair trial. <em>Id.; State v. Smith, </em>310 Or 1, 24, 791 P2d 836 (1990) (even if the court finds the prosecutor\u2019s remarks \u201cimproper, tasteless, or inappropriate,\u201d there is no abuse of discretion in the trial court\u2019s denial of a motion for mistrial unless the effect of the remarks was to deny the defendant a fair trial).</p>\n<p id=\"ARI\">Generally, a proper jury instruction is sufficient to protect the defendant against any prejudice. <em>Bowen, </em>340 Or at 511; <em>State v. White, </em>303 Or 333, 342, 736 P2d 552 (1987). However, there are some statements, that are so prejudicial that, as a practical matter, the prejudice cannot be remedied by an instruction. <em>State v. Jones, </em>279 Or 55, 62, 566 P2d 867 (1977). Therefore, the questions to be addressed here are the nature of the prejudice, if any, caused by the statements and whether the trial court\u2019s instructions were sufficient to cure it. <em>Id. </em>Ultimately, we must decide whether, under the circumstances as a whole, prejudice to defendant denied him the right to a fair trial, as a matter of law. <em>State v. Compton, </em>333 Or 274, 293, 39 P3d 833, <em>cert den, </em>537 US 841, <em>reh\u2019g den, </em>537 US 1068 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b202-5\">In evaluating those questions, we summarize again what the jury heard: (1) the prosecutor\u2019s comments that defendant had acknowledged to a detective \u201cthat he\u2019s got a sex problem and that he needs help\u201d and that he \u201cknows he shouldn\u2019t hav\u00e9 been talking to minors,\u201d which were immediately stricken and corrected by the trial court, followed by an instruction to the jury; (2) witness Johnson\u2019s testimony that he had met defendant \u201cin treatment,\u201d which the trial court struck and instructed the jury not to consider; (3) Detective Brown\u2019s testimony, which the trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>court did not strike, that defendant had \u201cacknowledged that he shouldn\u2019t be talking to minors,\u201d and (4) Detective Lidey\u2019s testimony, struck by the court, that he urged defendant to take responsibility for his misdeeds, and that defendant \u201cwas very receptive of that and acknowledged that he had * * * a problem and he needed to change his ways.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b203-4\">The asserted prejudice is that, contrary to the trial court\u2019s ruling excluding evidence of defendant\u2019s criminal record, the prosecutor\u2019s statement and the testimony of the three witnesses allowed the jury to infer that defendant in fact had previous convictions for sex offenses involving minors, and the jury could have based its determination of guilt for the charged crimes on defendant\u2019s propensity to commit such offenses. <em>See State v. Treit, </em>29 Or App 461, 464, 564 P2d 708 (1977). We agree with defendant that the prosecutor\u2019s statement and the testimony had the potential to cause the jury to wonder whether defendant had previously been convicted of sex offenses, but we conclude that none of the statements, separately, was so prejudicial that it could not be cured by an instruction. The prosecutor\u2019s comment during his opening statement to defendant admitting to a \u201csex problem\u201d did not refer specifically to a prior conviction nor to minors. And the trial court\u2019s ruling striking the statement, and its strong instruction that the statement was incorrect and that the jury should not consider it, adequately remedied the prejudice. The jury is presumed to follow the court\u2019s instructions, \u201cabsent an overwhelming probability that they would be unable to do so.\u201d <em>Smith, </em>310 Or at 26. There is no basis here to negate that presumption.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-5\">Johnson\u2019s unsolicited testimony that he and defendant had met in treatment also did not mention any prior conviction. However, considered in the context of the question to which it responded, that testimony allowed the jury to speculate that defendant had been in treatment as a result of a sex offense. Once again, the trial court struck the testimony and instructed the jury not to consider it, and the jury is presumed to have followed the instruction. <em>Id. </em>We conclude that the trial court\u2019s instruction adequately remedied any potential prejudice, and that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying the motion for mistrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>The testimony of Detective Brown that defendant had admitted that he knew he was not supposed to be speaking to minors might have caused the jury to speculate that defendant had some prior conviction relating to minors. However, once again, the testimony did not specifically refer to a prior conviction. Additionally, the testimony was, as the state argued to the trial court, independently relevant to establish that the victims were minors, as well as defendant\u2019s knowledge of that fact, both elements of offenses with which defendant had been charged. Accordingly, the trial court did not err in rejecting it as a basis for mistrial. <em>State v. Schneider, </em>201 Or App 546, 563, 120 P3d 16 (2005), <em>adh\u2019d to on recons, </em>204 Or App 710, 131 P3d 842, <em>rev den, </em>341 Or 292 (2006) (a trial court does not err in denying a motion to strike and motion for mistrial when the evidence is relevant to a fact that must be determined by the jury); <em>Green v. Denney, </em>87 Or App 298, 302 n 3, 742 P2d 639 (1987), <em>rev den, </em>305 Or 21 (1988).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b204-4\">The final mistrial motion concerned Detective Lidey\u2019s testimony that defendant had acknowledged that he \u201chad a problem and he needed to change his ways.\u201d On defendant\u2019s objection, the trial court struck the testimony, but it denied the motion for mistrial, explaining that it did not consider the testimony to be prejudicial. We agree with the trial court that the prejudicial effect of the evidence, if any, was not so extreme that only a mistrial could remedy it.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-5\">Defendant contends that, even if the prejudice from each of the statements independently was insufficient to justify a mistrial, \u201ca jury\u2019s repeated exposure to improper propensity evidence that a defendant has previously committed crimes similar or identical to crimes charged * * * is incurable prejudice.\u201d We have never held that a mistrial can be based on cumulative prejudice of multiple errors that in and of themselves do not support the granting of a motion for mistrial. Assuming that cumulative prejudice or repeated references to excluded evidence can form a basis for a mistrial, <em>see State v. Barone, </em>329 Or 210, 229, 986 P2d 5 (1999) (assumed without deciding that mistrial motion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>can be based on cumulative prejudice from three unrelated rulings), <em>see also Ryan v. Palmateer, </em>338 Or 278, 294-95, 108 P3d 1127 (2005) (rejecting on state constitutional grounds the concept that multiple errors that do not, individually cause prejudice, can nonetheless be a basis for reversal as \u201cstructural error\u201d), we conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in rejecting any of defendant\u2019s contentions in this case that a mistrial was in order because of the cumulative effect of the various statements. As we have held, Brown\u2019s statement was relevant and there was no error in admitting it. The other statements did not make explicit reference to defendant\u2019s criminal record and, to the extent that the statements might have given the jury reason to speculate, there is no reason on this record to assume that the jury did not follow the trial court\u2019s instructions to disregard them.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-4\">Contrary to defendant\u2019s contention, this case has little in common with <em>Jones, </em>279 Or at 61-63, in which the Supreme Court held that the prosecutor\u2019s eliciting of inadmissible evidence \u2014 even though corrected by the trial court \u2014 caused prejudice that was so pervasive that it was not possible for the defendant to have a fair trial. In <em>Jones, </em>the defendant was charged with rape. The prosecutor, knowing that the defendant had no prior convictions for rape, nonetheless attempted to elicit testimony from a witness that the witness had told a police officer that she \u201chad heard [the defendant] had done it so many times before that he would go to the pen.\u201d 279 Or at 61. When the witness denied making the statement, over the defendant\u2019s objection, the prosecutor questioned the police officer about the alleged statement, and the police officer confirmed that the witness had made it. After further objection, the trial court reversed its prior ruling and instructed the jury to disregard the officer\u2019s testimony. However, the trial court denied the defendant\u2019s motion for mistrial. <em>Id. </em>at 62. In reversing the trial court, the Supreme Court held that, although it does not ordinarily reverse a case in which the trial court has sustained an objection to evidence, admonished the jury to disregard it, but denied a motion for mistrial,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b205-5\">\u201c[t]his prosecuting attorney, well knowing that he had no proof that defendant has been previously convicted of rape <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>*** persisted in making comments and insinuations to that effect, including the clearly improper attempt to get before the jury the alleged statement by [the witness] that he had \u2018done it so many times before.\u2019\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b206-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 63. The court held that \u201cthe prejudice resulting from the admission of such evidence was so pervasive as to lead us to the conclusion that, as a result, defendant was denied a fair trial.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In contrast to <em>Jones, </em>in this case defendant does not allege prosecutorial misconduct and the court found that the prosecutor did not elicit evidence that he knew to be false. Additionally, the stricken testimony did not explicitly refer to the excluded evidence. Rather, the testimony gave the jury reason to speculate that defendant had previously committed offenses of a sexual nature. The trial court\u2019s instructions to the jury not to consider the testimony precluded the jury from engaging in that speculation, and we see no reason to doubt that the jury followed the court\u2019s instructions. We reject defendant\u2019s contention that the prejudice to defendant was so grave that it could not be cured by instructions.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-5\">We caution, however, that this is a close case. We are guided by, among other things, the precept that a mistrial \u201cis a drastic remedy to be avoided if possible, consistent with fairness.\u201d <em>State v. Embry, </em>19 Or App 934, 941, 530 P2d 99 (1974). Our standard of review is deferential: An abuse of discretion occurs only when the court\u2019s ruling is not one of \u201cseveral legally correct outcomes.\u201d <em>State v. Rogers, </em>330 Or 282, 312, 4 P3d 1261 (2000). Our conclusion regarding the court\u2019s denial of defendant\u2019s motions for a mistrial does not imply, nor should it be taken to imply, that the court would have abused its discretion if it <em>had </em>granted a mistrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-6\">In his fifth assignment, defendant contends that Brown\u2019s testimony that defendant acknowledged after his arrest that \u201che shouldn\u2019t be talking to minors,\u201d although relevant, was excessively prejudicial under OEC 403.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The state contends that defendant did not preserve his objection under OEC 403, and we agree. It is true, as defense counsel <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>contends, that, in moving to strike the witness\u2019s testimony, defendant asserted, \u201cIt\u2019s objectionable, certainly prejudicial.\u201d But the context of that statement was defendant\u2019s assertion that admitting the evidence would allow the jury to infer that defendant had previous convictions for sex offenses involving minors, contrary to the trial court\u2019s ruling that defendant\u2019s criminal record was to be excluded unless defendant testified. As the state points out, that objection \u2014 akin to relevancy \u2014 is quite different from the prejudice argument that defendant now makes under OEC 403 \u2014 that the evidence was relevant, but that its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice. <em>See State v. Carrillo, </em>108 Or App 442, 445-46, 816 P2d 654, <em>rev den, </em>312 Or 527 (1991) (a relevancy objection under OEC 401 does not preserve a claim of error under ORC 403). We conclude that defendant\u2019s objection below did not alert the trial court to an objection under ORC 403, and that it was not preserved. In any event, even assuming that the objection was preserved, the evidence \u2014 which defendant contends would allow the jury to infer that he had committed other sex offenses\u2014 could nonetheless not be excluded under ORC 404(4), which provides, as relevant, that \u201c[in] criminal actions, evidence of other crimes, wrongs or acts by the defendant is admissible if relevant except as otherwise provided by\u201d statutory and constitutional limitations. Defendant does not contend that those statutory or constitutional limitations are applicable here.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-4\">As noted above, we reject defendant\u2019s remaining assignments of error without further discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b198-6\"> The issue that defendant maintains was wrongly decided in <em>Stamper </em>\u2014 i.e., that nonconsent to sexual activity for purposes of sexual abuse in the second degree can be actual or by virtue of incapacity \u2014 is currently under advisement at the Supreme Court in <em>State v. Ofodrinwa, </em>241 Or App 214, 250 P3d 405, <em>rev allowed, </em>350 Or 573 (2011).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b200-5\"> In the curative instruction, the court told the jury:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b200-6\">\u201cDefense counsel has moved to strike essentially the last minute or so of [the prosecutor\u2019s] opening statement.
