Cam, </em>255 Or App 1, 296 P3d 578 (2013), in which we upheld most of defendant\u2019s convictions and sentences for theft, possession of a stolen vehicle, possession of controlled substances, and unlawful possession of a short-barreled shotgun, and remanded some convictions of theft for merger and resentencing. We allow reconsideration to discuss an alleged factual misstatement in our opinion and modify our analysis accordingly, but otherwise adhere to the disposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-5\">The first issue that we addressed in our opinion was whether the trial court erred in denying defendant\u2019s motion to suppress evidence seized at defendant\u2019s home subsequent to a warrantless entry of his property. 255 Or App at 3. We concluded that the trial court properly ruled that defendant had not manifested a clear intent to exclude visitors from his property. <em>Id. </em>at 7-8.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-6\">The issue raised in the petition for reconsideration that we address concerns the signs on defendant\u2019s driveway. In describing the evidentiary record at the suppression hearing, defendant stated in his opening brief that \u201cDetective Johnson saw a \u2018private property\u2019 sign on a tree.\u201d He argued that, in entering defendant\u2019s property, detectives drove past \u201ctwo signs,\u201d a private property sign and a sign that read \u201c10 mph.\u201d Defendant did not argue that detectives drove past a \u201cNo Trespassing\u201d sign.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-7\">In our opinion\u2019s statement of the facts, 255 Or App at 3, we described <em>three </em>signs along defendant\u2019s driveway:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b172-8\">\u201cOn a tree next to the driveway, there was a sign that read \u2018PRIVATE PROPERTY,\u2019 and above it, a sign that read TO M.P.H.\u2019 Near the tree, on a metal pipe, was a sign that read \u2018PRIVATE PROPERTY.\u2019 See photograph attached as Appendix 2.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b172-9\">We included as Appendix 2 a photograph of defendant\u2019s driveway that had been included in the record. Later in the opinion, <em>id. </em>at 6, we distinguished this case from <em>State v. Roper, </em>254 Or App 197, 200, 294 P3d 517 (2012), noting that, in this case, unlike in <em>Roper, </em>there was not a no trespassing sign on defendant\u2019s property.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>Defendant now brings it to our attention that, in the photograph we attached to our opinion as Appendix 2, the private property sign under the 10 M.P.H. sign also states no trespassing in lettering too small to be plainly legible in the photograph. <em>See </em>http://www.publications.ojd.state.or.us/docs/ A142984.pdf. It further comes to our attention that that photograph was taken by a defense investigator in March 2009, more than one year after the detectives first entered defendant\u2019s property on December 26, 2007. At the suppression hearing, the defense investigator was asked to read the signs in the photograph and testified that one of them said \u201c10 miles an hour,\u201d and one said \u201cprivate property.\u201d The state\u2019s detectives testified that they recalled seeing only a single \u201cPrivate Property\u201d sign. No mention was made at the hearing of a no trespassing sign. Defendant now, for the first time, argues that the 2009 photograph shows that detectives drove past a no trespassing sign.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-4\">We do not ordinarily entertain arguments raised for the first time on reconsideration. To the extent that defendant is contending that we got the facts of the case wrong, we reject the contention. No witness made mention of the words \u201cno trespassing\u201d on the private property sign. Counsel never mentioned them until the petition for reconsideration. The trial court made no findings regarding the signage, but it did find that defendant had allowed entry onto his property and had not manifested a clear intent to exclude visitors. Viewing the evidence in a manner consistent with the trial court\u2019s ultimate conclusion, <em>see State v. Ehly, </em>317 Or 66, 75, 854 P2d 421 (1993), we assume that the trial court either did not see the words \u201cno trespassing\u201d on the photograph or assigned no special significance to them in the context of the record as a whole. We conclude further that the words \u201cno trespassing\u201d shown on the photograph do not alter our conclusion in our original opinion, 255 Or App at 8, that defendant did not manifest a clear intent to exclude visitors, and we adhere to our original disposition of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-5\">We reject without discussion defendant\u2019s contention that the trial court erred in imposing consecutive sentences for defendant\u2019s convictions for theft by receiving because all of the crimes were related as a matter of law and must be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>treated as a part of the same criminal episode. <em>See Orchard v. Mills, </em>247 Or App 355, 361, 270 P3d 309 (2011), <em>rev den, </em>352 Or 33 (2012) (trial court\u2019s imposition of consecutive sentences was supported by evidence of placement of separate firearms in separate locations in petitioner\u2019s home, which allowed trial court to conclude that the firearms were acquired separately).</p>\n<p id=\"b174-4\">Reconsideration allowed; former opinion adhered to as modified.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
