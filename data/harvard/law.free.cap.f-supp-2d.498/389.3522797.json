(collectively \u201cDey\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b456-25\">Relator Ven-A-Care filed its <em>qui tarn </em>complaint against Dey in the Southern District of Florida on August 13, 1997. Nine years later, after seeking numerous sixty day extensions from the court, the government elected to intervene. On August 24, 2006, the government filed a \u201ccomplaint-in-intervention\u201d against the defendants, which was unsealed on September 7, 2006, and served Dey with this unsealed complaint.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The factual basis for the complaint is set forth in this Court\u2019s prior opinion in <em>United States ex rel. Ven-A-Care of the Florida Keys, Inc. v. Abbott Labs., Inc., </em>491 F Supp.2d 12, 15-17 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>(D.Mass.2007), with which the Court assumes familiarity.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-4\">Among other things, Dey argues that all causes of action accruing in connection with claims submitted for payment more than 6 years before the government intervened are barred by the statute of limitations, 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3731(b)(1). Citing <em>United States v. The Baylor Univ. Med. Ctr., </em>469 F.3d 263, 268 (2d Cir.2006) <em>(\u201cBaylor </em>\u201d), Dey argues that the action is deemed to have been commenced against Dey for statute of limitations purposes when the complaint-in-intervention was filed by the government on August 24, 2006.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-5\">After oral argument, the Court <em>ALLOWS, </em>in part, and <em>DENIES, </em>in part, Dey\u2019s motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-6\"><em>PROCEDURAL </em>BACKGROUND<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b457-7\">Relator filed its initial complaint in 1995, and an amended complaint against Dey on August 13, 1997, in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida. Relator filed a separate complaint against Dey in this district on April 10, 2000. On December 22, 2004, the United States and relator moved to sever and transfer the claims against Dey in Florida to Massachusetts. Those claims were transferred to this district and assigned Case No. 05-11084. On June 26, 2006, in response to the United States\u2019 and relator\u2019s request, the related claims originally filed against Dey in the District of Massachusetts were severed from the remainder of that case and consolidated with the claims transferred from Florida. On August 23, 2006, this case finally saw the light of Dey when the United States filed its notice of intervention and complaint-in-intervention in the consolidated case. The complaint was formally unsealed on September 7, 2006. On October 31, 2006, relator Ven-A-Care filed an amended complaint, which adopted the United States\u2019 complaint. On November 20, 2006, the case was consolidated with this Court\u2019s Average Wholesale Price Multi-District Litigation (\u201cMDL\u201d) proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-10\">\n<em>DISCUSSION</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b457-11\">\n<em>A. The FCA</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b457-12\">The FCA is \u201cintended to reach all types of fraud, without qualification, that might result in financial loss to the Government.\u201d <em>United States v. Neifert-White Co., </em>390 U.S. 228, 232, 88 S.Ct. 959, 19 L.Ed.2d 1061 (1968). It permits private entities, called relators, to enforce the civil provisions of the act on behalf of the government. <em>See </em>31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3730(b). When a relator files suit, the FCA provides that the \u201caction shall be brought in the name of the Government.\u201d 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3730(b)(1). Consequently, \u201c[t]he relator in a <em>qui tam </em>FCA action, while having a stake in the lawsuit, represents the interests of the United States.\u201d <em>United States ex rel. Rockefeller v. Westinghouse Elec. Co., </em>274 F.Supp.2d 10, 16 (D.D.C.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b457-13\">When a private relator, such as Ven-A-Care, brings a claim' against a defendant, the statute mandates that a \u201ccopy of the complaint and written disclosure of substantially all material evidence and information the person possesses shall be served on the Government\u201d under Fed. R.Civ.P. 4(d)(4). <em>See </em>31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3730(b)(2). Furthermore, the FCA requires, \u201cThe complaint shall be filed in camera, shall remain under seal for at least 60 days, and shall not be served on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>the defendant until the court so orders.\u201d <em>Id. </em>This sixty day provision does not limit the number of extensions that the government may obtain in order to investigate the relator\u2019s complaint, provided the government can establish \u201cgood cause\u201d before the court presiding over the case. <em>Id.; see also United States v. Stella Perez, </em>956 F.Supp. 1046, 1052 (D.P.R.1997) (holding that the FCA \u201cimposes a duty of diligence on the part of the government to ascertain facts material to its right of action\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b458-4\">Ultimately, the government elects either to intervene in the case or to allow the relator to pursue the action alone on behalf of the United States. If the government chooses to intervene in a relator\u2019s suit pursuant to 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3730(b)(4)(A),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the FCA provides that \u201cthe action shall be conducted by the Government.\u201d This takeover provision dictates, \u201cIf the Government proceeds with the action, it shall have the primary responsibility for prosecuting the action, and shall not be bound by an act of the person bringing the action.\u201d <em>See </em>31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3730(c)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b458-5\">A defendant is not required to respond to any <em>qui tarn </em>complaint until 20 days after the complaint is unsealed and served upon it. 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3730(b)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b458-6\">\n<em>B. Statute of Limitations</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b458-7\">Dey moves to dismiss the government\u2019s complaint-intervention on the ground that it is time-barred. The FCA provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b458-8\">(b) A civil action under section 3730 [providing a right of action for FCA] may not be brought\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b458-12\">(1) more than 6 years after the date on which the violation of section 3729 [the FCA] is committed, or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b458-13\">(2) more than 3 years after the date when facts material to the right of action are known or reasonably should have been known by the official of the United States charged with responsibility to act in the circumstances, but in no event more than 10 years after the date on which the violation is committed, whichever occurs last.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b458-14\">31 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3731(b). \u201cGranting a motion to dismiss based on a limitations defense is entirely appropriate when the pleader\u2019s allegations leave no doubt that an asserted claim is time-barred.\u201d <em>LaChapelle v. Berkshire Life Ins. Co., </em>142 F.3d 507, 509 (1st Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b458-15\">\n<em>1. When did the action commence ?</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b458-16\">The critical question is when the instant action commenced for statute of limitations purposes. Dey relies primarily on <em>Baylor </em>to support its argument that the present suit commenced for purposes of the statute of limitations when the government filed its complaint-in-intervention. In <em>Baylor, </em>where the <em>qui tarn </em>action was filed by the relator eight years before the government intervened, the Second Circuit held that the date the \u201cGovernment\u2019s actions commenced (for statute of limitations purposes) was the date on which the eom-plaints-in-intervention were filed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 268. Moreover, it held that the government\u2019s complaint-in-intervention could not relate back to the date of the initial complaint by the relator pursuant to Fed. R.Civ.P. 15(c)(2) because:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b459-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>The secrecy required by \u00a7 3730(b) is incompatible with Rule 15(c)(2), because (as is well-settled) the touchstone for relation back pursuant to Rule 15(c)(2) is notice, i.e., whether the original pleading gave a party \u201cadequate notice of the conduct, transaction, or occurrence that forms the basis of the claim or defense\u201d .... The rationale of Rule 15(c) is that a party who has been notified of litigation concerning a particular occurrence has been given all the notice that statutes of limitations were intended to provide. By design, the seal provision of \u00a7 3730(b) deprives the defendant in an FCA suit of the notice usually given by a complaint. Because any relation back of subsequent filings to the original complaint is incompatible with the core requirement of notice under Rule 15(c)(2), continued running of the statute of limitations is warranted.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b459-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 270 (citations and internal quotation marks omitted). The Second Circuit specifically declined to address whether relation back under Fed.R.Civ.P. 15(c)(1) would be permitted because the parties did not brief that issue. However, the Second Circuit, in dicta, did suggest there was \u201ca colorable argument that the FCA implicitly \u2018permit[s]\u2019 a form of relation back that dispenses with the requirement of notice\u201d under Rule 15(c)(1). <em>Baylor, </em>469 F.3d at 270.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-5\">Defendant argues that under <em>Baylor, </em>this Court should look to when the government filed its unsealed complaint-in-intervention against Dey \u2014 August 24, 2006 \u2014 as the date the action \u201ccommenced.\u201d Under this approach, all causes of action based on claims made more than six years before the filing of the complaint-in-intervention would be time-barred.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-7\">Disagreeing with <em>Baylor, </em>the government replies that this FCA action commenced when the relator filed its complaint against Dey in August 1997. The government argues that the statute of limitations provision in the FCA provides that the period of limitations is measured against when the action is \u201cbrought,\u201d not when it is unsealed. <em>See </em>31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3731(b). The government\u2019s view is consistent with the holdings of trial courts that an FCA commences when the relator filed suit.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>See, e.g., United States ex rel.

April 3, 2007) (finding that an FCA action commences, and the statute of limitations is tolled, when relator files initial complaint).</p>\n<p id=\"b459-8\">Second, the government argues that the FCA permits the government to seek extensions upon a showing that it has been diligently investigating the case without requiring the extensions to be cabined within the six-year limitations period; thus, the statute of limitations is \u201ctolled\u201d during these extensions. <em>See </em>31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3730(b)(3). Dey responds that no provision in the FCA provides for such a \u201ctolling\u201d of the statute of limitations pending government investigation. Rather, it contends, \u00a7 3731(b)(2) contains the only \u201ctolling provision\u201d found in the FCA, and it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>runs three years from when \u201cfacts material to the right of action are known or reasonably should have been known\u201d by the appropriate \u201cofficial of the United States.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b460-4\">The government has the better argument that the action is commenced when the relator files its complaint. <em>See </em>Fed. R.Civ.P. 3 (\u201cA civil action is commenced by filing a complaint with the court.\u201d); <em>see also </em>4 Charles A. Wright <em>&amp; </em>Arthur R. Miller, <em>Federal Practice and Procedure </em>\u00a7 1056 (2d ed.2006) (suggesting that courts look to Rule 3 to determine how to commence an action unless the statute provides otherwise). Dey objects that an action cannot be \u201ccommenced\u201d for purposes of the statute of limitations unless the defendant receives notice of the complaint under Fed.R.Civ.P. 4. This argument contravenes the well established rule that \u201c[Fjiling a complaint suffices to satisfy the statute of limitations.\u201d <em>Henderson v. United States, </em>517 U.S. 654, 657 n. 2, 116 S.Ct. 1638, 134 L.Ed.2d 880 (1996) (citing <em>West v. Conrail, </em>481 U.S. 35, 39, 107 S.Ct. 1538, 95 L.Ed.2d 32 (1987)); <em>see also McIntosh v. Antonino, </em>71 F.3d 29, 36 (1st Cir.1995) (\u201cRule 3 adequately covers the mechanics of commencing an action in a federal district court, and the rule makes it transpicuously clear that an action is commenced when the papers are filed.\u201d). It is true that \u201cthe tolling of the statute contemplates that service is effected within a reasonable time period after filing the complaint.\u201d <em>Novak v. Nat\u2019l Broad. Co., </em>131 F.R.D. 44, 45 (S.D.N.Y.1990) (citing <em>Maxwell v. Swain, </em>833 F.2d 1177, 1178 (5th Cir.1987)). However, reasonableness must be evaluated within the context of the FCA\u2019s statutory scheme. The FCA provides specific rules for service of the complaint once it has been unsealed. Thus, in most situations, if a district court has granted the extensions for \u201cgood cause,\u201d and the complaint is served in a timely way once it has been unsealed, this reasonableness requirement is met.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-8\">Although there may be some ambiguity in the statutory scheme created by the FCA, \u201cno statute of limitations will block federal government actions unless Congress clearly and specifically says so.\u201d <em>Capozzi v. United States, </em>980 F.2d 872, 875 (2d Cir.1992). \u201c[Sjtatutes of limitations sought to be applied to bar rights of the Government, must receive a strict construction in favor of the Government.\u201d <em>Badaracco v. Cormn\u2019r, </em>464 U.S. 386, 391, 104 S.Ct. 756, 78 L.Ed.2d 549 (1984) (quoting <em>E.I. Dupont De Nemours &amp; Co. v. Davis, </em>264 U.S. 456, 44 S.Ct. 364, 68 L.Ed. 788 (1924)). \u201cThis canon is rooted in the traditional rule <em>quod nullum tempus oc-currit regi </em>\u2014 time does not run against the King. A corollary of this rule is that when the sovereign elects to subject itself to a statute of limitations, the sovereign is given the benefit of the doubt if the scope of the statute is ambiguous.\u201d <em>BP Am. Prod. Co. v. Burton, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 638, 646, 166 L.Ed.2d 494 (2006) (internal citations omitted). Thus, in determining the breadth of the statute of limitations, this Court must only ask \u201csimply how far Congress meant to go when it enacted the statute of limitations in question.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 649.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-11\">Looking to the language, purpose, and structure of the FCA, this Court concludes that the action commences, for purposes of the statute of limitation, when the relator files its sealed complaint against a defendant and otherwise meets the strictures of 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3730(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b460-12\">\n<em>2. Relation Back</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b460-13\">The next question is whether a so-called \u201ccomplaint-in-intervention\u201d should be treated as an amended complaint that relates back to the relator\u2019s initial complaint <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>under Fed.R.Civ.P. 15(c). Rule 15(c) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b461-4\">An amendment of a pleading relates back to the date of the original pleading when</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b461-5\">(1) relation back is permitted by the law that provides the statute of limitations applicable to the action, or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b461-6\">(2) the claim or defense asserted in the amended pleading arose out of the conduct, transaction, or occurrence set forth or attempted to be set forth in the original pleading ...</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b461-7\">Fed.R.Civ.P. 15(c). Generally, \u201cthe rationale of the relation back rule is to ameliorate the effect of the statute of limitations.\u201d 6A Charles A. Wright, Arthur R. Miller &amp; Mary Kay Kane, <em>Federal Practice and Procedure </em>\u00a7 1497 (2d ed.2006). In this manner, Rule 15(c) \u201cprovide[s][a] maximum opportunity for each claim to be decided on its merits rather than on procedural technicalities.\u201d <em>Siegel v. Converters Transp., Inc., </em>714 F.2d 213, 216 (2d Cir.1983) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b461-8\">Once the government decides to intervene, it has the primary responsibility for prosecuting the action and is not bound by the actions of the relator. <em>See </em>31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3730(c)(1). As such, once the government is in the driver\u2019s seat, it has the statutory right to amend the complaint, and usually does so. <em>See </em>1 John T. Boese, <em>Civil False Claims and Qui tam Actions, </em>\u00a7 4.05[B] at 4-173 (3d 3d.2006). It is the practice in this district that when the government elects to intervene in <em>qui tam </em>cases, it files a pleading styled as a \u201ccomplaint-in-intervention.\u201d <em>See, e.g., California ex rel. Ven-A-Care of the Florida Keys, Inc. v. Abbott Labs., Inc., </em>478 F.Supp.2d 164 (D.Mass.2007). A review of the caselaw suggests that the government\u2019s practice of filing a complaint-in-intervention is nationwide.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-9\">Many courts have taken the view that a complaint-in-intervention should be treated as an amended complaint under Fed. R.Civ.P. 15. See, <em>e.g., United States ex rel. Purcell v. MWI Corp., </em>254 F.Supp.2d 69, 75 (D.D.C.2003) (stating that \u201cthe government\u2019s complaint in intervention is an amendment of the relator\u2019s complaint\u201d under Rule 15). Although the United States typically files its own complaint-in-intervention, nothing in the FCA requires a complaint-in-intervention. Instead, the United States could elect to intervene by simply using the relator\u2019s complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-10\">The key dispute (left open by Baylor) is whether the FCA provides a principle of relation back under Rule 15(c)(1) that would allow the government\u2019s 2006 complaint-in-intervention to utilize the earlier date of commencement provided by the relator\u2019s 1997 suit. This provision, added to the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure in 1991, was intended to make clear \u201cthat the rule [of general relation back] does not apply to preclude any relation back that may be permitted under the applicable limitations law.\u201d <em>Nelson v. County of Allegheny, </em>60 F.3d 1010, 1014 n. 4 (3d Cir.1995) (citing 1991 Advisory Committee Note); <em>accord Saxton v. ACF Indus., Inc., </em>254 F.3d 959, 962-63 (11th Cir.2001). According to the Advisory Committee Note to Rule 15, if the law providing the limitation \u201caffords a more forgiving principle of relation back than the one provided in this rule, it should be available to save the claim.\u201d <em>See </em>6A Charles A. Wright, Arthur R. Miller &amp; Mary Kay Kane, <em>Federal Practice and Procedure </em>\u00a7 1503 (2d ed. Supp.2001) (noting that \u201c[i]n 1991, Rule 15(c) was amended to clarify that relation back may be permitted even if it does not meet the standards of the federal rule if it would be permitted under the applicable limitations law\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b462-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>As is well established, the FCA contemplates a direct link between the interest of the relator, who is always acting \u201cin the name of the Government,\u201d and the government in every <em>qui tam </em>suit. <em>See </em>31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3730(b)(1). Indeed, a Latin scholar might recognize the phrase <em>\u201cqui tam </em>\u201d as \u201can abbreviation for <em>\u2018qui tam pro domino rege quam pro seipso,\u2019 </em>which literally means \u2018he who as much for the king as for himself.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States ex rel. S. Prawer &amp; Co. v. Fleet Bank of Maine, </em>24 F.3d 320, 324 n. 7 (1st Cir.1994) (citations omitted); <em>see also United States ex rel. Rockefeller, </em>274 F.Supp.2d at 16 (\u201cThe relator in a <em>qui tam </em>FCA action, while having a stake in the lawsuit, represents the interests of the United States\u201d); <em>see United States ex rel. Zissler v. Regents of Univ. of Minn., </em>154 F.3d 870, 872 (8th Cir.1998) (\u201cEven in cases where the United States has declined to intervene, the structure of the <em>qui tam </em>procedure, the extensive benefit flowing to the government from any recovery, and the extensive power the government has to control the litigation have been held to weigh heavily for holding that it remains the real party in interest\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b462-4\">The unique structure of the FCA supports the government\u2019s position that the government\u2019s complaint should be treated as an amended complaint that relates back to the relator\u2019s complaint under Rule 15(c)(1). <em>See United States ex rel. Kaplan v. Metro. Ambulance &amp; First-Aid Corp., </em>No. 00-Civ. 3010(ERK)(JMA), unpublished slip op. (E.D.N.Y. July 5, 2007) (citing <em>Rockwell Int\u2019l Corp. v. United States</em>, \u2014 U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 1397, 1411, 167 L.Ed.2d 190 (2007)) (holding that Rule 15(c)(1) relation back was authorized by FCA). Rule 15(c)(1), unlike Rule 15(c)(2), does not contain a specific requirement that the amended complaint be related to the same \u201cconduct, transaction or occurrence\u201d in the original complaint. Nonetheless, the government concedes, relation back under Rule 15(c)(1) is limited. Thus, if the government\u2019s complaint contains new claims unrelated to those asserted in the original complaint, then the original complaint cannot serve as a proper placeholder under Rule 15(c)(1). For example, the government agrees it cannot bring claims against new parties which would be untimely under the six-year bar.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b462-9\">Dey objects that relation back under Rule 15(c)(1) is impermissible even when the claims and parties are substantially the same because the defendants lacked proper notice of the suit until the government unsealed its complaint-in-intervention in 2006. Unlike Fed.R.Civ.P. 15(c)(2) and Fed.R.Civ.P. 15(c)(3), notice is not a specific prerequisite of relation back in the 15(c)(1) context. <em>See Baylor, </em>469 F.3d at 270 (\u201cthe touchstone for relation back pursuant to Rule 15(c)(2) is notice.\u201d); <em>see also </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 15(c)(3) (allowing relation back only if party \u201chas received notice of the institution of the action\u201d). Although notice may be the lighthouse of Rules 15(c)(2) and 15(c)(3), Dey points to no case-law, and this Court finds none, to support the contention that a rule of relation back created by statute cannot be permitted under Rule 15(c)(1) without notice, especially since the statute at issue mandates such secrecy. <em>See </em>31 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3730(b)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b462-10\">Dey next objects to the sufficiency of Ven-A-Care\u2019s 1997 complaint on the grounds that the relator\u2019s initial complaint remained sealed for a significant period of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>time and that the government did not act with proper diligence in investigating Ven-A-Care\u2019s claims. (Def.\u2019s Mem. Supp. Mot. Dismiss 17 (citing <em>United States v. St. Joseph\u2019s Reg\u2019l Health Ctr., </em>240 F.Supp.2d 882, 888 (W.D.Ark.2002)) (frowning upon \u201cthe multiple interventions [by the government] ... [which] appear to the Court to have no other justification than to allow the government to investigate and settle the multiple claims at its own pace, selectively carving out those claims that were easiest to settle while keeping the remaining defendants in limbo until it chose to act against them\u201d)). In this case, the government investigated the case for nearly a decade before ultimately deciding to enter the fray and allowing the case to surface.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b463-4\">While the number of extensions is worrisome, here, Dey has not produced any evidence that these extensions were improper, in bad faith, or prejudicial. Th\u00e9 court originally in charge of this litigation permitted the government a number of lawful extensions to the sixty day seal deadline. Indeed, the government contends that Dey had notice of the action virtually from the time it was filed and engaged in considerable efforts to persuade the government not to intervene. Thus, prejudice is unlikely. While in some circumstances egregious delay may be sufficiently prejudicial to trigger due process concerns, this record is insufficient to address any constitutional concerns.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-7\">\n<em>3. Sufficiency</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b463-8\">Having determined that the FCA allows relation back under Rule 15(c)(1), this Court turns to the factual issue of \u201cwhether the relator\u2019s <em>qui tam </em>complaint, as drafted and filed, could serve as a sufficient placeholder to achieve relation back in the <em>qui tam </em>context.\u201d <em>Baylor, </em>469 F.3d at 270. The determination of whether Ven-A-Care\u2019s initial complaint could serve as a Rule 15 placeholder requires this Court to \u201cevaluate] the sufficiency of [the] relator\u2019s complaint,\u201d viewed against the backdrop of \u201cthe FCA itself, [including] its structure and purposes.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Campbell v. Redding Med. Ctr., </em>421 F.3d 817 (9th Cir.2005)). Some courts have held that if the relator\u2019s initial complaint were \u201cegregiously defective,\u201d it neither commences the action for purposes of the statute of limitations nor serves as a relation back placeholder. <em>Id. </em>at 270 n. 10 (citing <em>Biby v. Kansas City Life Ins. Co., </em>629 F.2d 1289, 1294 (8th Cir.1980)); <em>see also United States ex rel. Health Outcomes Techs. v. Hallmark Health Sys., Inc., </em>409 F.Supp.2d 43, 49-50 (D.Mass.2006) (finding that a complaint could not relate back to the date relator originally filed the complaint in a plainly improper venue).</p>\n<p id=\"b463-9\">Dey argues that the relator\u2019s complaint is defective because this Court lacked subject matter jurisdiction over Ven-A-Care\u2019s initial complaint.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> If the Court did not have jurisdiction over Ven-A-Care\u2019s first <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>pleading, the government\u2019s complaint-in-intervention cannot properly relate back. Dey contends that this Court lacks subject matter jurisdiction because Ven-A-Care filed two <em>qui tarn </em>actions: one in 1997 in Florida and one in 2000 in Massachusetts. 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3730(b)(5) provides that \u201c[w]hen a person brings an action under this subsection ,[i.e., the Florida suit], no person other than the Government may intervene or bring a related action based on the facts underlying the pending action.\u201d All subsequent actions, therefore, are precluded. <em>See United States ex rel. Lujan v. Hughes Aircraft Co., </em>243 F.3d 1181, 1186 (9th Cir.2001) (holding that if an FCA action is based on the same facts underlying a pending case, the court must dismiss the later-filed case for lack of jurisdiction).</p>\n<p id=\"b464-4\">If the 2000 complaint were based on the same facts as the initial 1997 complaint, then the Court would not have jurisdiction over the 2000 Massachusetts complaint.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> However, this Court still would have jurisdiction over the original 1997 Florida complaint because the Florida case was properly transferred to this district as part of the overarching AWP multi-district litigation. Consequently, Dey\u2019s jurisdictional challenge, which assumes this Court\u2019s power flows from the 2000 Massachusetts complaint, is flawed. At very least, this Court has jurisdiction over the 1997 complaint; therefore, it may serve as a relation back placeholder for the government\u2019s complaint-in-intervention.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-8\">A <em>The Triggering Date</em></p>\n<p id=\"b464-9\">Dey argues that the relevant date for purposes of the statute of limitations is when the defendant first launched the scheme to submit false claims in 1992. Dey, citing to <em>United States v. Bornstein, </em>423 U.S. 303, 313, 96 S.Ct. 523, 46 L.Ed.2d 514 (1976), argues that it cannot be held liable for each false price because it initially published the allegedly false price in 1992 and never changed it.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The First Circuit has roundly rejected this proposition. An FCA claim accrues each time a false claim is submitted. <em>See United States v. Rivera, </em>55 F.3d 703, 707 (1st Cir.1995) (stating that an FCA violation \u201cwas \u2018committed,\u2019 for statute of limitation purposes, whenever [defendant] can properly be said to have presented its [false] insurance claim to the government\u201d) (citations omitted). Indeed, Dey\u2019s publication of false price data, which involves the regular quarterly republication of false AWP figures with knowledge that these figures would be used to set reimbursement figures for subsequent claims, is distinguishable from the case in <em>Bomstein, </em>where the submission of multiple claims \u201cwas, so far as [defendant] was concerned, wholly irrelevant completely fortuitous and beyond [defendant\u2019s] knowledge or control.\u201d <em>Bornstein, </em>423 U.S. at 312, 96 S.Ct. 523. As such, in this case a claim accrued each time a false claim was presented. <em>See Rivera, </em>55 F.3d at 707.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-10\">\n<em>C. Unjust Enrichment and Fraud</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b464-11\">The parties agree that 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2415(a),<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> which provides a six-year limi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>tations period, controls the government\u2019s claim of unjust enrichment, whereas 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2415(b),<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> which provides a three-year limitations period, applies to the government\u2019s fraud claim, which sounds in tort. <em>See United States v.

Although the government\u2019s complaint-in-intervention relates back to the date of Ven-A-Care\u2019s original filing on August 13, 1997 under the FCA, the government points to no legal basis for applying Fed.R.Civ.P. 15(c)(1) to the common law claims. For the reasons explained in <em>Baylor, </em>there is no relation back under Fed.R.Civ.P. 15(c)(2) because no notice was given of the complaint. <em>Baylor, </em>469 F.3d at 270. Thus, the government cannot recover on a theory of unjust enrichment for claims that accrued prior to August 23, 2000; similarly, the government cannot recover on its action for fraud for any claims that accrued prior to August 23, 2003.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-4\">\n<em>D.Rebate Agreements and 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396r-8</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b465-6\">42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396r-8 states that in order for a drug manufacturer to receive payments from the Medicaid program, the manufacturer must have first \u201centered into and have in effect a rebate agreement\u201d with the federal government. On February 28, 1991, Dey entered into such a rebate agreement with the government pursuant to this statute. Dey argues in its motion to dismiss that this rebate agreement, because it is an express contract that controls the subject matter of the government\u2019s claims, precludes the government from recovering on its claims under the FCA and common law \u2014 including fraud and unjust enrichment.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-9\">Each Rebate Agreement specifies that \u201cnothing in this Agreement shall be construed as a waiver of relinquishment of any legal rights of the Manufacturer or the Secretary under the Constitution, the Act, other federal laws, or state laws.\u201d Rebate Agreement \u00a7 IX(d).

The Court has ordered all documents relating to Dey to be unsealed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b458-9\">. 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3730(b)(4) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b458-10\">(4) Before the expiration of the 60-day period or any extensions obtained under paragraph (3), the Government shall \u2014 \u2022</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b458-11\">(A) proceed with the action, in which case the action shall be conducted by the Government; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b458-17\">(B) notify the court that it declines to take over the action, in which case the person bringing the action shall have the right to conduct the action.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b459-6\">. Indeed, the relator goes so far as to describe <em>Baylor </em>as a \u201crenegade\u201d opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b462-7\">. The parties have not briefed the standard for evaluating whether new claims against the initial defendant are time-barred. According to the relator, the 1997 complaint only involved physician administered infusion drugs, but the later complaint involved different drugs. The Court does not address that issue here.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b463-5\">. These long delays are quite troubling. Evidence spoils, memories fade, and prejudice may result. In my experience, the government routinely files for multiple extensions of time, frequently citing as the reason the size of the case and lack of resources to investigate adequately. At some point, though, the government must fish or cut bait. <em>See, e.g., United States ex rel. Franklin v. Parke-Davis, </em>No. 1:96-cv-11651-PBS, (requiring the government to decide whether or not to intervene after approximately three years of investigation).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b463-11\">. Normally, this Court would not consider arguments first raised in a reply brief. However, I have decided to address Dey\u2019s challenge because it goes to this Court\u2019s subject matter jurisdiction and because the government had an opportunity to rebut Dey\u2019s argument in its sur-reply.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b464-5\">. Dey also contends that the facts on which the 1997 Florida complaint relies were publicly disclosed in 1996. The government disagrees, stating that the government report involved other manufacturers.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b464-6\">. According to the MDL record, a drug manufacturer typically reports drug pricing on a quarterly basis to the compendia. Any fact dispute about the frequency with which Dey reported its prices can be addressed during discovery.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b464-13\">.This statute provides, in pertinent part, that \"every action for money damages brought by the United States or an officer or agency thereof which is founded upon any contract express or implied in law or fact, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>shall be barred unless the complaint is filed within six years after the right of action accrues or within one year after final decisions have been rendered in applicable administrative proceedings required by contract or by law, whichever is later....\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2415(a).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b465-13\">.
