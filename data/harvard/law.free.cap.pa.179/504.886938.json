A still owed for the machinery, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>judgment having been obtained against him, levy was made upon the machinery, whereupon the plaintiffs claimed to be the owners of it and this issue was framed in which the execution creditors of A were made defendants. <em>Held, </em>(1) that the burden of proof was on the claimants; (2) that as the testimony was insufficient to go to the jury it was proper to give binding instructions in favor of the defendant in the interpleader.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"syllabus\" id=\"b527-3\"><em>Practice, S.

G. Huggins. The uncontradicted evidence discloses the following facts: In 188T the defendant in the execution, C. G. Huggins, with John J. Davis and a man named Johnson, formed a partnership under the style of \u201c The Allegheny Roasting Company \u201d for the purpose of engaging in the business of roasting coffee, etc. They leased a lot from the wife of John J. Davis and thereon erected a building. They placed in this building, in the manner in which machinery is usually attached, such wheels, shafting, roasters and other machinery as was necessary to carry on the trade, and engaged regularly in the business for winch they had associated. In 1888 or 1889, Johnson sold out his interest to John J. Davis and C. G. Huggins, who continued the business down to January 1,1891, when Huggins bought the interest of Davis <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>in the machinery, fixtures and business, for $1,750, and agreed not to remove the same until the purchase price of the interest was paid. For the amount which he was to pay Davis for the interest he gave a note, which the latter subsequently assigned' to Mrs. Annie M. Purdy, who, on February 27, 1894, entered judgment on the note and. caused execution to be levied upon the machinery in question as the property of said C. G. Huggins.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b528-4\">Upon the same day that Davis sold out to Huggins, the latter took a new lease for the ground upon which the machinery was placed from Lillie M. Davis, the wife of his former partner; said lease was for four years from January 1, 1891, and gave to Huggins the privilege of renewal upon its expiration. Huggins went into and continued in the sole and exclusive possession of the entire property down until the levy bjr the sheriff upon the machinery in question.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"Ami\">On September 27, 1892, the owner of the land, Mrs. Davis, executed a mortgage, in which her husband, J. J. Davis, joined, upon the lot in question to the United Security Life Insurance and Trust Company. Huggins was at that time in possession and no inquiry was made as to his rights. In December, 1893, the ground was sold upon proceedings on the mortgage to Gallagher Brothers, the plaintiffs in this issue. All this time Huggins was openly in possession of the lot and Gallagher, the purchaser, who was his brother-in-law, knew this and testifies that he knew that Huggins had bought the machinery and given a note for it. After Gallagher had bought the lot at sheriff\u2019s sale he told Huggins to continue on, and rent was subsequently paid to Gallagher. The machinery never was in Gallagher\u2019s possession. In his testimony he seemed to be desirous of giving the impression that he had actually taken possession, but when he was squarely asked the question, Q. \u201cSo he turned everything over to you, did he?\u201d A. \u201cWho?\u201d Q. \u201c Huggins.\u201d A. \u201cI don\u2019t know whether he did or not; it was sold out at sheriff\u2019s sale, and he throwed up the sponge, J just rented the place to him. He said nothing to me at all.\u201d The whole testimony shows nothing which indicates that Gallagher ever, prior to the levy by the sheriff, made any claim to Huggins that he, Gallagher, owned the machinery. After Huggins- had unsuccessfully attempted to strike down the claim of Mrs. Purdy and had been defeated in a jury trial, be and Ids <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>brother-in-law, Gallagher, may have joined forces to defeat the collection of the judgment, but they were then too late. The only claim to the property set up by Gallagher in his testimony is: \u201cI bought it at sheriff\u2019s sale, December, 1898 or 1894.\u201d That is the sheriff\u2019s sale of the real estate of Mrs. Davis. Under the facts in evidence, we are of opinion that the trade fixtures did not pass to the purchaser of the real estate, at the sheriff\u2019s sale.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b529-3\">Judgment entered on the verdict.

Huggins, was in the plaintiffs or not. As claimants of the property in question, the burden of proof was on Gallagher Brothers, the plaintiffs in the issue. The learned trial judge, being of opinion that the testimony introduced by them was insufficient to go to the jury, withdrew the case from their consideration and directed them to render a verdict for the defendant, which was accordingly done. This action of the court is the subject of complaint in the first and second specifications.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-5\">A careful consideration of the testimony has satisfied us that, in the circumstances, there was no error in holding that the evidence was insufficient to justify its submission to the jury, and in directing a verdict for defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-6\">The remaining so called specification may be dismissed with the remark that it is not according to rule, in that it fails to eall attention to any specific error of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-7\">There is nothing in the case that requires further notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-8\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
