The latter died pending the suit, without leaving any issue, and under thirty years of age; the significance of which, with other facts, will appear from the opinion of the Supreme Court. The defendant also denied liability in this suit because the insured had refused to submit the matters to arbitration under the terms of the policy which provided that in case the parties could not agree upon the loss, appraisers should be chosen \u25a0 to adjust it. The court submitted the case to the jury on the question whether the value of the house at the time of the fire was equal to the amount of the policy, and what that value was. The court instructed the jury that, under the will of David McKee, John McKee took an estate in fee. The court also instructed the jury that the' refusal to arbitrate did not constitute a sufficient defense to the action.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b404-6\">Verdict and judgment for plaintiff for $3,195.

The condition was nothing more than an agreement to refer to three appraisers to be appointed at a future time, to determine the amount of the loss by the award of any two of them. It was a revocable agreement and the insurance company is in no position to complain, here or elsewhere, of the revocation of it. It has not shown that it admitted the validity of its policy, or its liability under it, but on the contrary it has, in the language of the learned judge of the court below, \u201c always denied its liability on ground which, if sustained, cut up the contract by the roots.\u201d The foregoing views are fully warranted and sustained by the decision of this Court in Mentz v. Ins. Co., 79 Pa. 478. In Assurance Co. v. Hocking, 115 Pa. 407, it was distinctly held in an opinion by Mr. Justice Clark that where an agreement to arbitrate does not provide for submitting matters in dispute to any particular person or tribunal named, but to one or more persons to be eventually chosen by the parties, it is revocable by either party. Further consideration of this branch of the insurer\u2019s contention is deemed unnecessary, because the cases cited furnish a sufficient answer to it.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-4\">Another defense to the action is that the interest of the insured in the property destroyed was \u201cother than unconditional and sole ownership,\u201d and this depends on the construction of the will by which he acquired title to it. The property destroyed was a dwelling house included in the devise by David McKee of his homestead to John D. McKee \u201cto be his forever for his own proper use,\u201d subject only to a restriction of alienation until he attained the age of thirty years, which in his case was for the period of thirteen years. In Jauretche v. Proctor, 48 Pa. 466, Woodward, C. J., said: \u201cA <em>partial </em>restriction, such as not to alien to a particular person or for a limited time, may be supported, but a general restraint of alienation when annexed to an absolute estate is void, upon the familiar principle that conditions repugnant to the estate to which they are annexed bind not.\u201d This is in accord with the view expressed by Tilghman, C. J., in McWilliams v. Nisly, <em>2 </em>S. <em>&amp; R. </em>507, and by Coulter, J., in McCullough v. Gilmore, 11 Pa. 870. It is said in 6 Am. &amp; Eng. Ency. of Law, p. 877, note 4, that \u201c the weight of authority seems to be against such restraints however limited as to time.\u201d The ground on which a partial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>restraint of alienation is supported is that it is not inconsistent with a reasonable enjoyment of the fee: McWilliams v. Nisly, supra, and Libby v. Clark, 118 U. S. 250. While the cases on this point are conflicting, the Pennsylvania cases we have, cited seem to sustain a partial restraint of alienation. But we may assume that the restriction in question, is valid without conceding that it relieves the insurer from liability on its policy. The conditions of the policy are to be understood, not in their technical sense, but as requiring that the insured be the actual and substantial owner: Beach on Insurance, sec. 405. The risk was not affected by the restriction. It was not inconsistent with a reasonable enjoyment of the estate devised, and the insured was the actual, sole and substantial owner of the property destroyed. For the reasons above stated the restriction in question cannot be regarded as affording a defense to the action.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-5\">It is'contended however that if the insured by the devise to him of the homestead acquired an estate in fee simple it was by another provision of the will, defeasible on his death under thirty years of age without issue. The provision referred to is preceded by the devise of the homestead, by gifts of annuities to the brothers, sisters, and children of the testator, and by the appointment of executors. It is as follows: \u201c On the death of my heirs herein named all property and bank stock to be sold and divided among all the heirs should my grandson John D. McKee die before he is thirty without leaving any heirs his estate to be divided pro rata among the heirs.\u201d We have quoted it entire and as it was written. It is quite clear that by \u201c my heirs herein named \u201d the testator meant the annuitants, and that \u201call the heirs\u201d included John D. McKee. It is also obvious that \u201c all property and bank stocks \u201d did not include the homestead previously devised in fee. The part of the provision which relates to the division of John D. McKee\u2019s estate may be fairly referred to his share of the proceeds of the property previously directed to be sold. , It may be possible to construe it as including the homestead, but it seems to us that this is not the reasonable interpretation of it. \u201c The clearly expressed purpose of a testator is not to be overborne by modifying directions that are ambiguous and equivocal, and may justify either of two opposite interpretations. Such directions are to be so construed as to support the testator\u2019s distinctly announced main inten<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>tion : \u201d Sheetz\u2019s Appeal, 82 Pa. 218. \u201c Where there is a clear gift in a will it cannot afterwards be cut down except by something which with reasonable certainty indicates the intention of the testator to cut it down: \u201d 2 Jarman on Wills, 443. Applying this well settled rule of construction to the will under consideration we hold that there is nothing in it which clearly indicates that it was the intention of the testator to defeat or modify his devise of the homestead. There is no other question raised by the specifications which requires discussion. All the specifications are overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-5\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
