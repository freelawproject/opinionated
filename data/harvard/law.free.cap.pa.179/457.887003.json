At the time of the giving of the note sued upon the consideration of which being the transfer and assignment of certain oil and gas leases in Washington county, the plaintiff, W. J. Weixel, holding himself out to be Weixel &amp; Co., falsely and fraudulently represented to the defendant that the territory leased gave every prospect of yielding large wells and that a certain well then in process of drilling upon said leases, was not then in the gas sand, when in point of fact the said well at that time had been drilled through the gas sand and through the Gordon sand, and through said false and fraudulent representations procured from the defendant the execution and delivery of the note sued upon. That the fact that the well had been drilled through the gas sand, and was only a small producer was well known to the said Weixel and by the residents of that locality at the time the defendant was induced to give his note and take an assignment of said leases. And this with other circumstances largely prejudiced the defendant, rendered the property valueless, and precluded him from making any profit thereon.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b480-9\">Second.
