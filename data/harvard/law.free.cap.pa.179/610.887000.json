The youngest child is about fourteen years of age, and the oldest past twenty-one.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b633-6\">Hawkins, P. J., filed the following opinion:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b633-7\">While it may be conceded that the death of one of the intended beneficiaries under this will made Dr. Foster a party interested in the trust estate as next of kin, his interest is manifestly not such as can be made presently available in attachment by his creditors; for it cannot be taken without prejudice to his children\u2019s rights : Drake on Attachment, 245. The trust estate is of such a character as to be incapable of present division. It consists of the household furniture which was in use during Mrs. Foster\u2019s lifetime, and has been continued since in the same character. While there was no formal appointment by the donee, there was its equivalent in the permissive use which the trustee allowed his children. Dr. Foster testified that this continued use was in accordance with testatrix\u2019s wish. It was at least a natural use, for it was part of the equipment, and necessary to the enjoyment of the children\u2019s home. Its appointment to that use was made when all three children were living, and Dr. Foster\u2019s good faith could not have been questioned. No change has since been made, and Dr. Foster can receive no increased benefit so long as this continues. The furniture, as a whole, is not less necessary to the surviving children. Their father is admittedly insolvent; and certainly as between him and them, he could not deprive them of what was necessary to their home comfort; for they were made the primary objects of bounty with his express consent; and what he could not, his creditors ought not to be permitted to do. The household furniture so far as appears is an entirety which cannot be broken without a breach of trust: Slemmons\u2019 Est., 178 Pa. 156.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b633-8\">It has been seen that Dr. Foster has taken no positive action in the exercise of his discretion since his son\u2019s death with respect <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"612\">*612</page-number>to the use of the furniture. The apportionment of the principal will not become imperative until the majority of his youngest son, six years hence; and as it has not been made to appear that there is any contemplated action in the meantime to the prejudice of exceptant there is no present occasion for interference by this court. If occasion should in the meantime require, the question may arise whether or not the surviving beneficiaries have a right, assuming that Dr. Foster is incompetent, to the appointment of a trustee competent to act on the principle that a trust shall not fail for want of a trustee. The fact that, in the event of Dr. Foster\u2019s death, the will expressly provides his \u201c successor in the line of the trust shall have all of the power and discretion \u201d which had been given him, necessarily implied that the exercise of these powers was intended to be made incidental to, and limited only by the duration of the trust. The trust having been created for the benefit of all the children, each was' interested in its continued existence; and it is not apparent why the death of one should prejudice the others, especially in view of the evident purpose to prefer them to Dr. Foster. As the father was, in contemplation of law, primarily liable for the training and maintenance of the children, the natural presumption is that the discretion given was subsidiary, and intended to be governed by the need of each of them.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b634-5\">DECREE.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b634-6\">And, now, to wit June 15,1896, this matter came on for hearing and distribution, at this term, upon exceptions thereto, and testimony taken, and was argued by counsel, and thereupon, upon consideration thereof, it is ordered, adjudged and decreed that the exceptions be dismissed without prejudice to raise questions upon the termination of trust created by will of decedent, and that the fund in hands of accountant, viz: $1,024.02, be paid in accordance with the following schedule of distribution, unless an appeal be taken herefrom within twenty days.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b634-7\">Balance as per account:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b634-8\">Household goods valued at ... $1,000 00</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b634-9\">Cash........ 24 02</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"Af3G\">$1,024 02</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AqeM\">7 00 Deduct clerk\u2019s costs</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AzD\">Balance for distribution $1,017 02</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b635-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"613\">*613</page-number>To Dr. S.

Foster does not create a spendthrift trust, \u2014 an estate the cestui que trust cannot part with, nor creditors touch. To create such it is necessary that provisions against alienation and liability for debt should be expressed: Girard L. Ins. etc. Co. v. Chambers, 10 Wright, 492; Keyser v. Mitchell, 67 Pa. 473; Hill on Trusts, 489.</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b635-9\">In trusts of this character, the cestui que trustent take, not from the donee of the power, but from the donor, and have vested interests, and if the power of distribution be not exercised, and until its exercise, the whole class of objects will be entitled to the property in equal shares: Hill on Trustees, 492; McKonkey\u2019s App., 13 Pa. 257; Graeff v. DeTurk, 44 Pa. 527; Casterton v. Sutherland, 9 Ves. 445; Wills v. Cooper, 1 Dutcher (25 N. J. L.), 137; Hill on Trustees, 252.</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b635-10\">Merger may have a partial operation. It may operate upon an undivided portion of the estate, as upon one third, precisely as in case of holding the entire interest in the premises: Preston on Merger, 88,89; 4 Kent\u2019s Com., 100; 6 Greenleaf\u2019s Cruise, sec. 7. If the law of merger is permitted to operate, Dr. Foster has an undivided one third interest in Amanda W. Foster\u2019s estate, discharged of the trust, which his creditors may attach: Drake on Attachments, 248.</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b635-11\">A discretionary power cannot, without express authority, be delegated to a stranger by assignment inter vivos: Hill on Trustees, 489. The very nature of a trust precludes the idea that Dr. Foster can exercise discretion for himself: Lewin on Trusts, 2 Star, 14; Bolles v. State Trust Co., 27 N. J. Eq. 308; Wills v.
