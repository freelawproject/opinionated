At that time he was possessed of the following property, viz: Three mortgages, the principal sums of which amounted to four thousand, seven hundred (4,700) dollars, cash on deposit in the Dollar Savings Bank of Pittsburg and in the German National Bank of Allegheny, and a one thousand (1,000) dollar bank note \u2014 these three items amounting to four thousand and fifty-five (4,055) dollars. These, with a small pension and a small amount of almost worthless furniture was all the property he possessed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b583-12\">On September 12,1891, the plaintiff gave into the possession of the defendant, the one thousand dollar-bank note. On th.e <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>26th day of October, 1891, plaintiff, defendant and one John Shauber, Jr. went to the German National Bank of Allegheny City, and plaintiff drew his check in favor of the said John Shauber, Jr., for the whole amount of his deposit, viz : $2,155.34, which amount was placed to the credit of said Shauber. This transaction was wholly without consideration. Plaintiff\u2019s bank book was afterwards given into the care of the defendant. On the next day, October 2T, 1891, plaintiff and defendant went to the Dollar Savings Bank of \u00a1Pittsburg, and plaintiff transferred his entire deposit to the defendant, viz., nine hundred (900) dollars, without any consideration. On the next day, October 28, 1891, the plaintiff, at Esquire Brinker\u2019s office, made a will, in which he gave to his brother in Germany ten (10) dollars and all the rest of his property to the defendant, and to John Shauber, Jr., share and share alike. Beilstein and John Shauber, Jr., the same who had the day before received the deposit of plaintiff in the German National Bank, were both present at the making of the will. The will also made Herman Beilstein and John Shauber, Jr., executors. The plaintiff had also relatives in Butler county, Pennsylvania. This will went into the possession of the defendant. Immediately after the making of this will, the plaintiff'and defendant went\" to the courthouse, and there the plaintiff assigned the three aforementioned mortgages to the defendant, viz., the Kirschner mortgage of $2,800; the Happ mortgage of $1,000 and the Wiegand mortgage of $900. The assignment of each, of these mortgages is in the words following :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b584-5\">\u201c For value received, I, John Hasel, mortgagee, do sell, assign, transfer, and set over to Herman Beilstein, his heirs and assigns, this mortgage and all moneys secured thereby.

The Happ mortgage was on the 5th day of February assigned to Martin Schaeffer by the defendant, and the Wiegand mortgage was assigned on the 26th day of December, 1891, by the defendant to the 12th Ward Premium B. ,&lt;&amp; L. Association of Allegheny City. It is also admitted that defendant drew $20.66 of tire funds in the Dollar Savings Bank.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b586-5\">We find that the defendant did not receive any of the sums of $2,155 or of $161.25 deposited in the German National Bank, and that he cannot be charged therewith.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b586-6\">CONCLUSIONS OK LAW.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b586-7\">[In our findings of fact that the plaintiff transferred his property to the defendant in trust and confidence to keep for him, subject to his demand, we acted under the well known rule that where the answer is a responsive one it must be overcome with two witnesses, or one witness and corroborative circumstances, but we do not believe we need have gone that far. In cases like the present one we believe the rule to be as follows: Whenever a person obtains by voluntary donation a large pecuniary benefit from another, he is bound, if that transaction is questioned, -to prove that the transaction was righteous, and that the donor voluntarily and deliberately did the act, knowing its nature and effect. This rule is not confined to cases of attorney and client, parent and child, etc., but is general: Cook v. Lamotte, 15 Beavan, 234.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b586-8\">Again, \u201c Whenever one person obtains by voluntary donation a large pecuniary benefit from another, the burden of proving that the transaction is righteous is upon the person taking the benefit, but proof that the donor knew and understood what he was doing is sufficient. Where the donee occupies a confidential relation to the donor, and the amount of the gift bears a large proportion to the estate-of the donor, the donee must prove that the gift was made intelligently, and with a full knowledge by the donor of the true character of the transaction: \u201d Clark v. Clark, 174 Pa. 809.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b587-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>Applying these rules, the defendant has not only failed to prove that the donor knew and understood what he was doing, its nature and effect, or that the gift was made intelligently, and with a full knowledge by the donor of the true character of the transactions, but the testimony satisfies the court just the opposite was the case, and we have so found.] [9]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b587-5\">[As the Kirschner mortgage for $2,800 is still in the possession of the defendant, he must be decreed to reassign it to the plaintiff, and as the fund in the Dollar Savings Bank is in the name of the defendant, he must be decreed to retransfer it to the plaintiff. As the Happ and Wiegand mortgages have been disposed of by the defendant, amounting to $1,900, and as defendant has received $700 interest on the Kirschner mortgage, and $125 interest on the Happ mortgage, and $45.00 interest on the Wiegand mortgage, and also $20.66 from the Dollar Savings Bank account, the defendant must be decreed to pay to the plaintiff said sums, amounting to two thousand seven hundred and ninety dollars and sixty-six cents ($2,790.66), with interest at 6 per cent on the Happ and Wiegand mortgages from the date of their assignment by the defendant to date of the decree. As to the $1,000 loan charged in the bill, it must be dismissed without prejudice to proceed at law, and as to the two items of $2,155 and $161.25 in the German National Bank, the bill must also be dismissed. There must also be an injunction restraining defendant from disposing in any way of the Kirschner mortgage or the fund in the Dollar Savings Bank.

It must appear clearly and strongly that the donor knew and understood what he was doing, and the effect it might have in impairing his ability to provide for himself and others; that he acted on competent and independent advice, and had a full disclosure of the effects and consequences; and that he made the gift freely and voluntarily, wholly free from undue influence or solicitation on the part of the donee: Cooke v.

There is high English authority for such position, though Lord Romilly, in Cooke v. Lamotte, 15 Beavan, 234, cited by the judge below, adopts it with much reserve, but the American courts have not usually required such proof from the donee until he is put on the defensive by the appearance in the case of some indication of weakness of mind, undue influence, fraud, deception, confidential relation, or other element to render the transaction at least suspicious. See Stepp v. Frampton, ante, p. 284.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>But It is not necessary to enter on this debatable ground, as the donee in the present case clearly stood in confidential relation to the donor. The latter was old and illiterate, a German not able to read or write English, and speaking and understanding it imperfectly. The appellant was a younger man, also a German, but carrying on business in the ordinary way in an English speaking community. An intimacy sprang up between the two, resulting in the plaintiff making appellant\u2019s store a place of daily resort, putting his papers and property, mortgages, bonds, bank books, etc. in the latter\u2019s hands for safe keeping, and seeking his advice upon business matters. When under such circumstances the plaintiff by writings in the English language divested himself of his entire property, handing-over the larger part to the appellant, and the rest to appellant\u2019s brother-in-law, Shauber, even if it was a gift, the rule of equity in its least stringent form requires that the donee should show that it was freely and voluntarily made, with full knowledge of the nature of the act, and its effect upon the donor in relation to his estate. The decree of the court below could well be sustained on this ground alone.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-5\">But the learned judge goes farther and finds that it was not a gift at all, but a transfer \u201c to the defendant in trust and confidence to keep for the plaintiff, subject to his demand.\u201d Tins is decisive of the whole case and renders superfluous any discussion of the assignments of error to subordinate findings of fact. It is argued for appellant that this conclusion is reached by the court below in disregard of the weight always given in equity to a responsive answer in denial. But the learned judge states expressly that he had given the appellant the benefit of that rule, and after an examination of the evidence we find no reason to differ with his conclusion. The testimony of the plaintiff himself is supported by that of Fallhaber, that appellant told him he only took care of the money and exhibited a little book where he kept the account, \u201c so that he could show it to the old man again.\u201d And the testimony of both receives strong corroboration from the circumstances of the case already noted.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-6\">The testimony objected to in the thirteenth to seventeenth assignments had some bearing on plaintiff\u2019s character and disposition with regard to money, and consequently on the probability <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>of bis comprehension of what he was doing, and whether he Was imposed on. It was therefore admissible on the question of gift, but as the court found there was no gift it becomes of no importance at all.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-5\">Appellant charges that plaintiff divested himself of his property in order to enter the Soldiers\u2019 Home, and thereby committed a fraud on the government which will prevent a court of equity from aiding him. It is sufficient to say that the evidence of such intent is slight, and there is no evidence at all that his having or not having such an amount of property had any bearing on his admission to the Home.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-6\">Decree affirmed with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
