Jackson, to equalize the value of their share of my estate.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b626-8\">The premises devised to the children of his deceased son John in the 14th item are the same referred to in 9th item and are situate 'on Fifth avenue opposite the courthouse.' The title <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>\u201c hump \u201d in Pittsburg parlance designates the part of the city in its vicinity. On the 14th day of May, 1888, ordinances were presented in councils to grade the streets of this district, action upon which was indefinitely postponed November 12,1888. In 1891 and 1892 the question was discussed but no action has been taken by councils and the \u201chump \u201d has not been graded down.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b627-3\">The testator left no instructions for the \u201c guidance \u201d of the trustees as to the erection of the building on the lot devised to his grandchildren.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b627-4\">Their ages at his death, June 12,1894, were \u00e1s follows: Frank H., sixteen; May, fifteen; and Kate, nine. It is admitted that if the present net income of the trust estate continues, the $10,000 directed to be accumulated in the ninth item of the will will be accumulated within a period of five years after the testator\u2019s death. The fund for distribution, $3,178.87, is the net income since the death of the testator, after the payment of all charges and annuities, and it is conceded that it should be distributed either to the trustees under the ninth item of the will, or one third to the testator\u2019s grandchildren, and one third to each of his daughters, Mrs. Flannery and Mrs. Jackson, under the tenth item.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b627-5\">It is contended by the counsel for the testator\u2019s daughters that there is no express gift of the $10,000 referred to in the ninth item of the will; that there is a possibility that it might not be accumulated within the period limited by the statute regulating accumulations; that the gift is in abeyance and does not vest until it is finally settled \u201c whether the \u2018 hump \u2019 is to be cut down or not,\u201d which is so indefinite as to be obnoxious to the rule against perpetuities; and that, therefore, the provisions of the will relating to the accumulation of the fund and its expenditure are void. It is clear that after the testator\u2019s widow, the children of his deceased son, John, were special objects of his bounty, and preferred to the other beneficiaries. He provided a home for them and their mother with his widow, gave them annuities whilst the fund was accumulating, and made no provisions for his daughters during that period. The value of the lot devised to them and of the one devised to the children were to be equalized upon the basis of the assessed value at the.time of his death, by the payment by the daughters to them <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>of sufficient to mate the value of their share one third of the whole. In addition to this, it was his manifest intention that the value of their devise should be increased by the expenditure of the $10,000, to be accumulated from the income of the greater part of his estate, in erecting a building upon it. The question is whether this intention is to be defeated. Whilst the testator lid not use apt words, yet the will vests the legal title to the greater part of his estate in his executors for the purposes specified in it. The legal title to the fund to be accumulated was then vested in them, and the equitable title in the testator\u2019s grandchildren, for whose benefit it was to be expended in the improvement of the lot devised to them. If the testator had devised the real estate included in the trust directly to his grandchildren to hold until the net rents received by them, after the payment of the fixed charges, amounted to $10,000, with remainder at that period to them and his two daughters, subject to the widoAy\u2019s annuity, the statute regulating accumulations clearly would not apply. This in effect he did, and the fact that he vested the legal title in trustees with directions as to the application of the accumulations is immaterial. It was a present beneficial gift of the income until a certain sum should be received. In discussing the question of the application of the statute to such cases in Wahl\u2019s Estate, 26 W. N. C.' 249, Judge Penrose said: \u201c In all cases, however, the first inquiry is how far, if at all, has the will under consideration directed, or indirectly occasioned, an accumulation contrary to the statute. The term itself implies a withholding of income for the purpose of creating an increased and constantly increasing fund for distribution at a future time; and, manifestly, a present beneficial gift of income until a certain sum shall have been received by the donee, is not in itself forbidden by anything in either the letter or spirit of the act. A direction to apply rents or income in payment of a specified sum to a designated person is no more a direction to accumulate than a gift of the estate until out of the rents the donee has received an equivalent amount would be. Such a direction gives to the legatee a vested interest in the rents, etc., as they arise; and if there be coupled with it a provision for accumulation until the trustee shall have enough to pay in full, the only person having the right to complain is the legatee himself \u2014 the person who, in the lan<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>guage of the act, \u2018would, have been entitled .... if such accumulation had not been directed.\u2019 The authorities upon this subject are very fully collected and commented on by Mr. Scott in his admirable essay on Trusts for Accumulation, sections 110, 111, etc. See also Lewin on Trusts, ch. VII. sec. 1, pi. 12, etc.; Gray on Perp., sec. 671 et seq. Of course, if the person so entitled chooses to waive his right to call for the rents as received by the trustee, any interest arising from their investment follows the rents themselves, and belongs to him.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b629-4\">The daughters do not appear to be interested in the question raised, in regard to the directions as to the use of the fund violating the rule against perpetuities, for if they are impossible or void for any reason the beneficiaries will take the fund: McIntyre v. McIntyre, 123 Pa. 335; Culins\u2019 Appeal, 20 Pa. 243. The gift in the ninth item, however, seems to be either a devise of rents amounting to $10,000, or a legacy of that amount for a particular purpose. In 1 Jarman on Wills, 397-8 (side paging), it is said: \u201cWhere the purpose of the gift is the benefit solely of the donee himself, he can claim the gift without applying it to the purpose, and that, it is conceived, whether the purpose be in its terms obligatory or not. . . . Thus if a sum of money be bequeathed to purchase for any person a ring, or a life annuity, or a house, or set him up in business, or for his maintenance and education, or to bind him apprentice, or towards the printing of a book, the profits on which are to be for his benefit, the legatee may claim the money without applying it or binding himself to apply it to the specified purpose; and even in spite of an express declaration by the testator, that he shall not be permitted to receive the money. . . . These cases rest on the principle that the court will not compel that to be done which the legatee may undo the next moment, as by selling the thing to be purchased, or giving up the business.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b629-5\">This principle applies here, for if the fund be expended as directed, the devisees if of age, could at once sell the lot and get the money; and if all would not join in a sale each could sell his or her undivided interest. It is therefore optional with the testator\u2019s grandchildren, whether they will take the money, or have the building erected. It follows that the testator\u2019s grandchildren are not bound by the directions, as to the accumulation and expenditure of the fund; and if of full age, by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number>terms of the will, would be entitled after payment of the fixed charges to the rente and income directed to be accumulated. If then it be conceded that the act regulating accumulation applies, those made within the limited period would be good; and as the fund here Avas accumulated within that period, it must, in any vieAv of the case, be distributed to the trustees under the ninth item of the will.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b630-4\"><em>Error assigned </em>was decree of the court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b630-5\"><em>Wm.
