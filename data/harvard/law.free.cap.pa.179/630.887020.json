Viewers were appointed who assessed benefits on the land of Maria F. Smith, James J. Mead, Frank H. Speer, A. J. Mercer, Margaret A. Mercer, Harriet Spratt, A. M. Marshall and Frank LeMoyne, and made their report, which was confirmed nisi September 28, 1895. On October 7, 1895, James J. Mead, Frank H. Speer, Frank LeMoyne, A. J. Mercer, Margaret A. \u2022 Mercer, Maria F. Smith, and Harriet Spratt filed exceptions, as follows : (1) the said assessments are based upon the cost and not on the value of the improvements; (2) said assessments are excessive and exorbitant, and greater than the value of said improvements; (8) said assessments are unjust and inequitable; (4) said assessments are improperly made because the said viewers have not from their personal inspection and examination ascertained, (a) the character of the work; (5) the situation of the property; <em>(o) </em>the adaptability of the pavement to the grade of the street; ('d) the particular damage or the benefit resulting to each property. October 28, 1895, A. M. Marshall filed exceptions.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b653-5\">On November 1, 1895, the appellant by leave of court filed an additional exception, viz: That the testimony adduced before said viewers in support of their exceptions was not a part of said report, nor had it been filed of record in this case, and that the said report is defective, insufficient, incomplete and not in accordance with law.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b653-6\">On the same day the exceptions were dismissed, and the report'confirmed absolutely.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b653-7\">The testimony taken was not attached to or made a part of the report when filed, and the court refused to consider it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b653-8\">On November 6, 1895, the following order was made: \u201cIt appearing to the court that on October 28, 1895, exceptions to the viewers\u2019 report were filed by A.

She had the fullest opportunity to be heard, and the record of the proceedings in court indicates a desire on her part to avoid a hearing and de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"633\">*633</page-number>cisi\u00f3n of the question. The exceptions to the report of the viewers were in substance that the assessments were based upon the cost and not the value of the improvements, and that they Avere excessive and inequitable; and that they Avere improperly made because the viewers had not from personal inspection ascertained the character of the work, the situation of the property, the adaptability of the pavement to the grade of the street, and the particular -benefit or damage resulting to each property. The first time these exceptions appeared on the list their argument was postponed at the request of the appellant\u2019s counsel. The second time they were ready for argument, counsel asked the court to appoint a commissioner to take the testimony anew, and this request being refused they declined to proceed Avith the argument or to point out their objections to the report. The report was then confirmed, but upon information that the exceptions filed by one of the parties had through mistake not been placed on the argument list and an opportunity for a hearing given him, the court set aside the confirmation of the report and. reopened the case as to al] the parties excepting, and the testimony taken before the viewers was filed. When the case again came on for hearing, counsel for the exceptants neither argued their exceptions nor stated to the court any reason for setting aside the report, but raised new questions not before us now. The report was then confirmed, and properly confirmed. The appellant has been given everything she was entitled to, and has received all she asked except a decision in her favor without reason therefor.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-3\">The proposition that the proceeding before the viewers, the appearance, the introduction of testimony and the filing of exceptions, were preparatory only and preliminary to a hearing before the court is not sustained by the decision in Travers\u2019s Appeal, 152 Pa. 129, or Pittsburg Manufacturing Co.\u2019s Appeal, 158 Pa. 464, and it is wholly untenable. This is the proceeding provided by the act of 1891 for the ascertainment of benefits and damages, with the right of appeal, and to demand a trial by jury. The hearing by the court is upon exceptions to the report of viewers, and the court has power to modify or change its assessments or to refer the report back to the same or to a new jury. It is the duty of th\u00e9 court to superA\u00dase and review the work of the viewers and to correct errors to which its attention is called <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"634\">*634</page-number>by the exceptions filed, but it is not its duty to direct the testimony to be taken anew when that heard by the jury is before it, or to proceed de novo and consider all the testimony taken and make a new award. Its work is that of review on exceptions filed. Every presumption is in favor of the award, and unless errors in proceedings or findings are pointed out the report should be confirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-4\">The decree is affirmed at the cost of the appellant.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
