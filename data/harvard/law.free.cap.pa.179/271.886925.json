A missing-hotel maid being pursued by an irate parent.\u201d And the article reads thus: \u201c About three months ago Miss Mollie O\u2019Toole, a pretty young woman about twenty years of age, applied for work in a prominent hotel of this city. She was from McKeesport. Being of good appearance and having good manners, she was made parlor maid, which is a very desirable place for women in hotel work, but two days ago she disappeared, and is said to have gone to Philadelphia to meet a chewing gum agent whom she met at the hotel. The chewing gum gentleman made his appearance at the house about a month ago, and he and the girl got noticeably thick. He staid about one and a-half weeks, after which Miss O\u2019Toole, a girl friend noticed, got despondent. Her sudden leave to join her drummer friend explains this, but their life will not be one of a rosy path, if her father, who is said to have gone to Philadelphia with a gun to hunt for them, finds them. Miss O\u2019Toole is said to have been engaged to a young man in McKeesport when she left there.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b294-10\">This was followed the next day, October 11, with another article, which reads thus, without any head lines: \u201c The advantage which the chewing gum agent has over other traveling men in gaining the good will of the dear girls has again been demonstrated in this city. A chewing gum man from Phila<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>delphia put up at one of our hotels and Mollie O\u2019Toole at once lost her heart. He wooed her with gum of the most succulent sort, and every time Mollie worked her jaws, she felt her love for the sweet man growing. When he voluntarily presented her with a whole box of gum, it was too much, and she hesitated no longer. Her father is now following her and her gum man into the wild, wicked east.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b295-3\">The plaintiff having testified that after her return from her trip East, some three weeks after the publication, she went to the office of the Post Printing &amp; Publishing Company and there saw a Mr. Barr, she then continued as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b295-4\">\u201c Q.

What did Mr. Barr say to you, and what was done at that interview? A. Well, he said he supposed they just did it for a mere joke, and I asked him if he would contradict it in the paper, and he said, no he wouldn\u2019t do that if I intended to bring suit against him. I told Mm I was not guilty of that, and he would have to account for it. I says, \u2018 I\u2019ll show that it is not so.\u2019 He said, \u2018We won\u2019t retract if you intend to bring suit against us.\u2019 [1]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b295-9\">\u201c Q.

The fact of the agency and the right of the agent to speak for the company were not at the time questioned, and it afterward appeared from the testimony that he was acting within the scope of his authority. The plaintiff had gone to the office of the company to demand a retraction of the libelous publication. What was then said by any one connected with the newspaper could not be shown as an incident of the litigated act of publication, but it was admissible on other grounds, if the party as editor or manager of the paper or an officer of the company had authority to speak for it. If the answer contained anything as to the motive of publication which was thought to be objectionable, the court should have been asked at the time to strike it out. . The objection being based upon specific grounds, all other grounds of objection might be considered as waived.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-5\">The second assignment is not supported by an exception to the ruling of the court. The third, fourth and fifth assignments relate to the admission of testimony to show the injurious effect of the publication upon the reputation of the plaintiff among' her friends and acquaintances, and that it prevented her from obtaining employment. Testimony as to the effect upon her feelings was properly excluded. There was no attempt to prove the meaning of the words used, or to explain the publication. The purpose was to show in what maimer the publication had affected the plaintiff where she was known, and how it had prevented her from earning a living. This was in support of her averment of special damage.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-6\">We see no merit in the sixth assignment. The plaintiff had testified that her request for a retraction was refused except on terms that she would not bring suit. On the part of the defendant it was denied that any terms were insisted upon. The fact was not established in favor of either party, and the learned judge might well pass it without comment. He was not asked to say anything in relation to it, and the defendant cannot now be heard to complain that he did not: Humes v. Gephart, 175 Pa. 417.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-7\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
