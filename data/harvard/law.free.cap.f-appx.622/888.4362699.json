On appeal, Hoever argues that the third amended complaint alleges facts sufficient to state a claim for retaliation under the First Amendment. After review,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-10\">The third amended complaint does not name E. Howard as a defendant and does not include any allegations of fact relating to Howard. Hoever has therefore abandoned any claim against Howard in this action. <em>C.f. Dresdner Bank AG v. M/V OLYMPIA VOYAGER, </em>463 F.3d 1210, 1215 (11th Cir.2006) (quotation -omitted) (\u201cAn amended pleading supersedes the former pleading; the original pleading is abandoned by the amendment, and is no longer a part of the pleader\u2019s averments against his adversary.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b917-11\">As to the remaining three defendants, to state a First Amendment retaliation claim under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, the third amended complaint must adequately allege: (1) that Hoever\u2019s speech or act was constitutionally protected; (2) that the defendants\u2019 retaliatory conduct adversely affected the protected speech; and (3) that there is a causal connection between the retaliatory actions and the adverse effect on the speech. <em>See Douglas v. Yates, </em>535 F.3d 1316, 1321 (11th Cir.2008). The third amended complaint fails to allege facts to support Hoever\u2019s conclusion that his transfer to a different prison adversely affected his protected speech and that the defendants were subjectively motivated to transfer Hoever because he complained of the conditions of his confinement. <em>See Smith v. Mosley, </em>532 F.3d 1270, 1278 (11th Cir.2008) (\u201cThe causal connection inquiry asks whether the defendants were subjectively motivated to discipline because [the prisoner] complained of some of the conditions of his confinement.\u201d). Absent non-conclusory allegations supporting two of the three elements of a retaliation claim, the third amended complaint fails to state a claim on which relief may be granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-15\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b917-12\">.
