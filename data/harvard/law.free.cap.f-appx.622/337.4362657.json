Stewart argues that the district court erred by finding he was unable to show that Treasure Bay\u2019s proffered legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for his termination was pretext for unlawful racial discrimination. For the following reasons, we AFFIRM the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-15\">I. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b366-16\">Edward Stewart was hired by Treasure Bay Casino to serve as a Security Officer on July 4, 2008. He was promoted to the position of Security Lead Officer on August 11, 2008. Treasure Bay\u2019s Security Director, Kenneth Key, was responsible for Stewart\u2019s promotion. Treasure Bay\u2019s Human Resources Director, Joe Thornton, also played a role in the promotion. For the first two years of his employment, Stewart received positive performance evaluations.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-17\">However, beginning in February 2010, Stewart was subject to a number of disciplinary actions. On approximately February 17, 2010, Stewart received an Action Notice for \u201cdirect[ing] ... subordinates to ignore established policy by telling them not to give ... requesting employees\u201d escorts to Treasure Bay\u2019s parking lot. This Action Notice was classified as a \u201cCoun<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>seling Notice,\u201d which is the first step of Treasure Bay\u2019s progressive discipline process.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On May 12, 2010, Stewart received a second Action Notice for instructing the security officers under his supervision \u201cnot to administer [an] ID check\u201d requested by Treasure Bay\u2019s surveillance department. This Action Notice was classified as a \u201cWritten Warning,\u201d which is the second step of Treasure Bay\u2019s progressive discipline process. Additionally, a written letter from Key was placed in Stewart\u2019s personnel file, with the subject line \u201cDisorderly Conduct.\u201d Key\u2019s letter explained that on December 28, 2010, Stewart entered the security supervisor\u2019s office in an intoxicated state. The letter also noted that on December 29, 2010, Stewart was asked to leave the Treasure Bay premises because he was intoxicated. The letter prohibited Stewart from being present at Treasure Bay after working hours.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-4\">On December 31, 2010, Stewart was issued another Action Notice, classified as a \u201cFinal Warning,\u201d which is the third step of Treasure Bay\u2019s progressive discipline process. The Action Notice explained that there had been \u201cmultiple instances of Security Lead Edward Stewart conducting himself in an unprofessional manner.\u201d It noted that \u201c[a]ny further violations of [Treasure Bay\u2019s] procedures could lead to further corrective actions including ... separation from the company.\u201d Underlying this Action Notice were multiple reports of Stewart\u2019s misconduct. For example, on approximately December 27, 2010, Brian Salas, a security officer who reported to Stewart, sent a letter to Key expressing his \u201cgrave concerns ... for the unfair and inconsistent treatment,\u201d that Stewart had subjected him to. Salas reported that Stewart repeatedly mispronounced his last name and when asked to pronounce it correctly, Stewart said \u201cthis is America and I\u2019ll say your name [however] I want.\u201d Key also received an email from April Pritt, another security officer under Stewart\u2019s supervision, who complained that Stewart \u201cintentionally goes out of his way to be rude,\u201d and that she \u201cdid nothing to deserve [this treatment] except decline his offer to go on a date.\u201d Pritt also noted that Stewart \u201ctreats Brian Salas ... terribly.\u201d Pritt concluded by commenting that Stewart is \u201cextremely rude, arrogant, and not a pleasure to work for at all,\u201d and that he \u201chas made us ... hate coming to work.\u201d A few months later, Key received additional complaints about Stewart from both Salas and Pritt. Finally, on March 30, 2011, Key received a letter from Treasure Bay employee David Sloan, which stated that Sloan felt that Stewart \u201cis very unprofessional and spends more time flexing his arms than worrying about protecting this [c]asino.\u201d Sloan reported that Stewart treated Salas poorly and that Stewart had previously stated that he thought he could do a better job as security director.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-7\">As a result of these complaints, Key decided to transfer Stewart to a different shift, which would have allowed Stewart to benefit from the supervision of a different security supervisor. Key intended for the shift change to take effect at the beginning of May 2011. However, before the shift change could take place, Key received reports of another altercation between Stewart and Salas. Pritt reported that on April 19,2011, Salas asked Stewart to pronounce his name correctly during a security briefing. Pritt explained that after Salas made this request, Stewart told Salas \u201cto \u2018get out and go talk to the wall.\u2019 \u201d According to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>Pritt, Stewart then \u201cslammed the door in [Salas\u2019] face.\u201d Pritt\u2019s characterization of the incident was corroborated by Elizabeth Bieller and Scottie Loree, who both served as Treasure Bay security officers.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-4\">After discussing Stewart\u2019s behavior with Thornton and Treasure Bay Chief Operating Officer Susan Varnes, Thornton determined that Stewart\u2019s conduct had violated Treasure Bay\u2019s Crewmember Handbook. He further concluded that Stewart should be terminated because he had repeatedly engaged in unprofessional conduct, Stewart was terminated on April 22, 2011. Varnes made the ultimate termination decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-5\">On June 20, 2012, Stewart filed a pro se complaint in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Mississippi and alleged that he had been \u201cretaliated and discriminated against because of [his] race.\u201d He purported to bring claims against \u201cThornton (Treasure Bay).\u201d The district court granted Thornton\u2019s motion to dismiss; however, it construed Stewart\u2019s complaint to also allege claims against Treasure Bay. Stewart subsequently withdrew his retaliation claim against Treasure Bay. On January 1, 2015, the district granted Treasure Bay\u2019s motion for summary judgment on Stewart\u2019s remaining Title VII discrimination claim. Stewart\u2019s timely appeal followed.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b368-6\">II. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b368-7\">\u201cWe review a district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment de novo, applying the same standard on appeal as that applied below.\u201d <em>Rogers v. Bromac Title Servs., L.L.C., </em>755 F.3d 347, 350 (5th Cir.2014). Summary judgment is proper \u201cif the mov-ant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed:R.Civ.P. 56(a). \u201cA genuine dispute as to a material fact exists \u2018if the evidence is such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the nonmoving party.\u2019 \u201d <em>Rogers, </em>755 F.3d at 350 (quoting <em>Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., </em>477 U.S. 242, 248, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 91 L.Ed.2d 202 (1986)). We construe \u201call facts and inferences in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.\u201d <em>Dillon v. Rogers, </em>596 F.3d 260, 266 (5th Cir.2010) (internal quotation marks omitted). Nevertheless, a summary judgment motion may not be defeated by \u201ccon-clusory allegations, unsubstantiated assertions, or only a scintilla of evidence.\u201d <em>Hathaway v. Bazany, </em>507 F.3d 312, 319 (5th Cir.2007) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b368-10\">III. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b368-11\">It is \u201cunlawful for an employer to fire an employee because of the employee\u2019s race.\u201d <em>Vaughn v. Woodforest Bank, </em>665 F.3d 632, 636 (5th Cir.2011) (citing 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-2(a)(l)). This court applies \u201cthe modified <em>McDonnell Douglas </em>approach in racial discrimination cases under Title VII.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Rachid v. Jack In The Box, Inc., </em>376 F.3d 305, 312 (5th Cir.2004); <em>McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, </em>411 U.S. 792, 93 S.Ct. 1817, 36 L.Ed.2d 668 (1973)). In order to survive summary judgment under that approach, the employee \u201cmust first present evidence of a prima facie case of discrimination.\u201d <em>Davis v. Dallas Area Rapid Transit, </em>383 F.3d 309, 317 (5th Cir.2004). To establish a prima facie case, Stewart must show: (1) that he is a member of a protected class; (2) that he was qualified to be a lead <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>security officer; (3) that he was fired; and (4) that he was replaced by someone outside of his protected class. <em>Vaughn, </em>665 F.3d at 636. If a prima facie case is established, the burden shifts to Treasure Bay to articulate a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for firing Stewart. <em>Id.; see also McDonnell Douglas, </em>411 U.S. at 802, 93 S.Ct. 1817. Once Treasure Bay presents \u201ca legitimate rationale for its employment action, the inference of discrimination disappears and the plaintiff must present evidence that the employer\u2019s proffered reason was mere pretext for racial discrimination.\u201d <em>Davis, </em>383 F.3d at 317. In order to establish pretext, Stewart must show that Treasure Bay\u2019s proffered reason for his termination \u201cis false or unworthy of credence.\u201d <em>Vaughn, </em>665 F.3d at 637 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b369-4\">Here, the district court, assuming that Stewart was able to establish a prima facie case, determined that Stewart failed to establish a genuine issue of material fact that Treasure Bay\u2019s legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for his termination was pretextual. We agree. The record establishes that Treasure Bay received numerous complaints, from a number of different Treasure Bay employees, about Stewart\u2019s poor job performance. The record also reflects that Treasure Bay relied on these complaints and Stewart\u2019s previous Action Notices to determine that he had engaged in unprofessional conduct. Clearly, Treasure Bay had a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for Stewart\u2019s termination.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-5\">Stewart argues that Treasure Bay\u2019s proffered explanation was pretext for unlawful race discrimination. However, nothing in the record suggests Treasure Bay\u2019s explanation was pretextual, such as evidence that he was subject to disparate treatment, <em>Vaughn, </em>665 F.3d at 637, or evidence that Treasure Bay\u2019s explanation was not \u201cthe real reason\u201d for Stewart\u2019s termination, <em>id. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted). Importantly, Stewart does not challenge the record evidence which supports Treasure Bay\u2019s position that he was subject to numerous reports of misconduct. Stewart contends that Treasure Bay\u2019s failure to interview him and other African-American employees during its investigation ' is evidence of pretext. However, Stewart has produced no evidence that Treasure Bay\u2019s failure to interview other African Americans was anything but coincidental. Furthermore, we have never required an employer\u2019s investigation to be perfect; it must only be non-discriminatory. <em>See Bryant v. Compass Grp. USA Inc., </em>413 F.3d 471, 478 (5th Cir.2005). Moreover, the record shows that Treasure Bay repeatedly discussed with Stewart the complaints about his conduct throughout the deration of his employment, albeit not immediately before he was terminated. Because Stewart has provided no evidence other than his own conclusory statements that Treasure Bay\u2019s reason for his termination was pretextual, the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment for Treasure Bay was proper. <em>See Jackson v. Cal-W. Packaging Corp., </em>602 F.3d 374, 379 (5th Cir.2010) (\u201c[An employee\u2019s] assertion of innocence alone does not create a factual issue as to the falsity of [the employer\u2019s] proffered reason for terminating him.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b369-7\">IY. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b369-8\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b366-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cm. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b367-5\">. Treasure Bay\u2019s Employee Handbook makes clear that employee discipline can begin at any step of the progressive discipline process. It further states that \u201cTreasure Bay is not bound to progressive discipline in all cases.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b368-8\">. Stewart only challenges the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment on his Title VII discrimination claim against Treasure Bay. He does not challenge the district court\u2019s de-cisi\u00f3n to grant Thornton\u2019s motion to dismiss or the district court's finding that he had withdrawn his retaliation claim against Treasure Bay.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
