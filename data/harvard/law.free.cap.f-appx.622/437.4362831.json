Lane now challenges the factual basis supporting his guilty plea and the application of a U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(l) weapons enhancement.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-7\">Although Lane\u2019s appeal waiver does not bar review of his claim that the factual basis of his guilty plea is insufficient, we review for plain error because Lane did not challenge the factual basis for his plea in the district court. <em>See United States v. Trejo, </em>610 F.3d 308, 312-13 (5th Cir.2010). To show plain error, Lane must show that the error was clear or obvious and affects his substantial rights. <em>See Puckett v. United States, </em>556 U.S. 129, 135, 129 S.Ct. 1423, 173 L.Ed.2d 266 (2009). If he makes such a showing, this court has the discretion to correct the error but only if it \u201cseriously affect[s] the fairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b466-8\">\u201c[A] district court taking a guilty plea [must] make certain that the <em>factual </em>conduct admitted by the defendant is sufficient as a <em>matter of law </em>to establish a violation of the statute to which he entered his plea.\u201d <em>Trejo, </em>610 F.3d at 313 (emphasis in the original). The factual basis must be \u201csufficiently specific to enable the district court to compare the conduct admitted by the defendant with the elements of the offense charged.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b466-13\">\u201cThe essential elements of a drug conspiracy are (1) an agreement by two or more persons to violate the narcotics laws; (2) a defendant\u2019s knowledge of the agreement; and (3) his voluntary participation in the agreement.\u201d <em>United States v. Vargas-Ocampo, </em>747 F.3d 299, 303 (5th Cir.2014). Lane\u2019s sole argument is that the Government failed to allege, or to adduce any evidence of, the existence of an agreement. He argues that the evidence establishes only that he engaged in distribution, that his relationship with James LeRoy May was that of buyer and seller, and that he and Kimberly Sue Davis, his common law wife, independently sold methamphetamine.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-14\">The undisputed facts in the record show that Lane and Davis, a common law married couple, lived in the same home, kept dfugs in a shared location in their home, and sold drugs to the same person, May. Based upon these facts, the district court could reasonably infer that Lane and Davis agreed to jointly supply May with methamphetamine. <em>See United States v. Hernandez-Palacios, </em>838 F.2d 1346, 1348 (5th Cir.1988) (\u201c[T]he trier of fact may infer agreement from circumstantial evidence.\u201d). Thus, the district court did not plainly err in finding that Lane\u2019s plea to conspiracy to distribute methamphetamine was supported by facts sufficient to establish each element of the charged offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-15\">Lane\u2019s plea agreement included a provision that waived his right to appeal or collaterally attack his sentence on any grounds other than ineffective assistance of counsel or prosecutorial misconduct of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>constitutional dimension. We review the validity and enforceability of an appeal waiver <em>de novo. See United States v. Baymon, </em>312 F.3d 725, 727 (5th Cir.2002). The court will enforce the waiver if it was agreed to knowingly and voluntarily. <em>See United States v. McKinney, </em>406 F.3d 744, 746 (5th Cir.2005). Lane\u2019s response to the Government\u2019s invocation of the appeal waiver is meritless, and Lane has waived any argument that his waiver was neither knowing nor voluntary by not briefing it. <em>See United States v. Thibodeaux, </em>211 F.3d 910, 912 (5th Cir.2000). Accordingly, the appeal waiver is valid and bars Lane\u2019s challenge to the sentencing enhancement.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b466-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
