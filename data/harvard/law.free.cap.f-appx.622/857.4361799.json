In his petition, Ene argues that he is not removable, and with regard to his asylum application, that the BIA and the IJ erred in: (1) making an adverse credibility determination; (2) considering the fraud allegations made during his remova-bility hearing; and (3) applying the REAL ID Act in his case, because it only applies to terrorists and he is not a terrorist. After thorough review, we deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-11\">We review the BIA\u2019s decision as the final judgment, unless the BIA expressly adopted the IJ\u2019s decision. <em>Ruiz v. Gonzales, </em>479 F.3d 762, 765 (11th Cir.2007). When the BIA expressly agrees with the IJ\u2019s reasoning, we review both decisions to the extent of the agreement. <em>Ayala v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>605 F.3d 941, 947-48 (11th Cir.2010). We review <em>de novo </em>legal issues presented in a petition for review. <em>Id. </em>at 948. We review factual determinations, including credibility determinations, under the substantial evidence test. <em>Ruiz v. U.S, Att\u2019y Gen., </em>440 F.3d 1247, 1254-55 (11th Cir.2006). Under this standard, \u201cwe review the record evidence in the light most favorable to the agency\u2019s decision and draw all reasonable inferences in favor of that decision.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1255 (quotation omitted). \u201c[W]e must affirm the [ ] decision if it is supported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1254-55 (quotation omitted). Thus, in order to reverse a finding of fact, we must determine that the record not only supports reversal but compels it. <em>Id. </em>at 1255.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-12\">The Attorney General has discretion to grant asylum to any alien determined to be a refugee under the INA. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(1). A refugee is defined as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A9T\">any person who is outside any country of such person\u2019s nationality ... and who is unable or unwilling to return to, and is unable or unwilling to avail himself or herself of the protection of, that country because of persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution on account of race, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"859\">*859</page-number>religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b887-6\">8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b887-7\">An applicant seeking withholding of removal must show that his \u201clife or freedom would be threatened [on removal to a given country] because of the alien\u2019s race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(b)(3)(A). \u201cThe [applicant] bears the burden of demonstrating that it is \u2018more likely than not\u2019 [he] will be persecuted or tortured upon being returned to [his] country.\u201d <em>Sepulveda v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1226, 1232 (11th Cir.2005). To obtain CAT relief, an applicant must demonstrate that \u201cit is more likely than not\u201d that a government official or person acting in an official capacity would torture him or aid or acquiesce in his torture by others. <em>Al Najjar v. Ashcraft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1303 (11th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b887-8\">The applicant bears the burden of establishing eligibility for relief by offering \u201ccredible, direct, and specific evidence in the record.\u201d <em>Forgue v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1282, 1287 (11th Cir.2005). An applicant\u2019s testimony may be sufficient, without corroboration, to sustain his burden of proof, but only if the trier of fact finds that the testimony \u201cis credible, is persuasive, and refers to specific facts sufficient to demonstrate that the applicant is a refugee.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(l)(B)(ii). Conversely, a denial of relief \u201ccan be supported solely by an adverse credibility determination, especially if the [applicant] fails to produce corroborating evidence.\u201d <em>Chen v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>463 F.3d 1228, 1231 (11th Cir.2006). If the IJ finds an applicant not credible; the IJ must make an explicit adverse credibility finding and offer \u201cspecific, cogent reasons for the finding.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b887-9\">The REAL ID Act applies to \u201capplications for asylum, withholding, or other relief from removal made on or after\u201d May 11, 2005. REAL ID Act, Pub.L.No. 109-13, \u00a7 101(h)(2), 119 Stat. 231, 305 (2005). Under the INA, as amended by the REAL ID Act, a credibility determination may be based on the totality of the circumstances, including: (1) the demeanor, candor, and responsiveness of the applicant; (2) the plausibility of. the applicant\u2019s account; (3) the consistency between the applicant\u2019s written application and the applicant\u2019s oral testimony; (4) the internal consistency of each statement; and (5) the consistency of the applicant\u2019s statements with other record evidence, including country reports. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(l)(B)(iii). Additionally, an adverse credibility determination may be based on inconsistencies, inaccuracies, or falsehoods regardless of whether they go to the heart of the applicant\u2019s claim. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b887-10\">For starters, we lack jurisdiction to address Ene\u2019s argument that he is not removable, since he failed to exhaust this issue before the BIA. <em>See Amaya-Artunduaga v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>463 F.3d 1247, 1250-51 (11th Cir.2006) (holding that we lack jurisdiction to consider a claim raised in a petition for review unless the petitioner has exhausted his administrative remedies by raising the claim before the BIA). As for Ene\u2019s claim that the REAL ID Act should not have been applied to his application, it is without merit, because the REAL ID Act applies to all applications for asylum or withholding of removal filed after May 11, 2005. <em>See </em>REAL ID Act, Pub.L.No. 109-13, \u00a7 101(h)(2), 119 Stat. 231, 305 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b887-11\">We also reject Ene\u2019s arguments that the IJ and BIA erred in concluding that he was incredible and that there was a lack of corroborating evidence. As the record reveals, substantial evidence sup<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"860\">*860</page-number>ports the adverse credibility determinations. The BIA properly noted that there were inconsistencies between Ene\u2019s testimony regarding the 2004 attack and the medical report he submitted in support of his claim, which indicated that his injuries were the result of a fall when a banister he was leaning on collapsed as opposed to an attack. This inconsistency was material to Ene\u2019s claim that he suffered past persecution, and provided a \u201cspecific, cogent reason\u201d for the adverse credibility finding. The BIA also noted that Ene\u2019s credibility was undermined by his fraudulent actions in obtaining the visa and in attempting to alter his Social Security Card, considerations which the IJ and BIA were permitted to rely on, although they stemmed from the underlying removal proceedings. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(l)(B)(iii). Additionally, the BIA observed that Ene\u2019s testimony was often rambling and difficult to follow, which related to his demeanor and was a proper consideration. <em>Id. </em>As a result, substantial evidence supports the adverse credibility determination and the record does not compel reversal. Moreover, because Ene failed to provide sufficient corroborating evidence, his application could be denied solely on the adverse credibility determination. <em>Chen, </em>463 F.3d at 1231. Thus, the BIA did not err in affirming the IJ\u2019s denial of Ene\u2019s application for asylum, withholding of removal, and CAT relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-4\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
