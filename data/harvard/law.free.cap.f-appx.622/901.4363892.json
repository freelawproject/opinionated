California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967). Our independent review of the record reveals that counsel\u2019s assessment of the relative merit of the appeal is correct. Because independent examination of the entire record reveals no arguable issues of merit, counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw is GRANTED, and Mr. Wynn\u2019s conviction and sentence are AFFIRMED.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b929-17\">. We acknowledge that Mr. Wynn expressed dissatisfaction with counsel\u2019s performance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"902\">*902</page-number>leading up to his guilty plea and that he might wish to argue that counsel was ineffective in that respect. Such claims, however, generally \"are not considered for the first time on direct appeal,\u201d but rather are best reserved for postconviction proceedings. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Tyndale, </em>209 F.3d 1292, 1294 (11th Cir.2000); <em>see Massaro v. United States, </em>538 U.S. 500, 504-05, 123 S.Ct. 1690, 155 L.Ed.2d 714 (2003).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
