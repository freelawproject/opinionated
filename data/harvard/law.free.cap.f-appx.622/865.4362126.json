He argues that the district court erred in only granting a 10-month reduction in his sentence under the factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). Liberally construing Mr. Gour-dine\u2019s <em>pro se </em>brief, <em>see United States v. Hung Thien Ly, </em>646 F.3d 1307, 1316 (11th Cir.2011), we reverse because there is no indication whatsoever in the record that the district court considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>See United States v. Williams, </em>557 F.3d 1254, 1257 (11th Cir.2009) (explaining, in the \u00a7 3582(c)(2) context, that a district court must consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors in evaluating whether to reduce a defendant\u2019s sentence).</p>\n<p id=\"b894-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"866\">*866</page-number>I</p>\n<p id=\"b894-4\">Mr. Gourdine was indicted in 2010 by a federal grand jury for his role in a conspiracy to distribute cocaine and marijuana. He pled guilty to a lesser-included conspiracy charge. Under the 2009 Sentencing Guidelines, Mr. Gourdine was assigned a base offense level of 34, and a criminal history category of V. This established an advisory guideline range of - 235 to 293 months\u2019 imprisonment. The statutory maximum term of imprisonment, however, was capped at 20 years, so the advisory guideline imprisonment range became 235 to 240 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-5\">The district court sentenced Mr. Gour-dine to 225 months\u2019 imprisonment. At the sentencing hearing, the district court indicated that the reason for the 10-month downward variance was because Mr. Gour-dine had waived his right to appeal. <em>See </em>D.E. 184 at 70. In its statement of reasons, the district court indicated that it had considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-6\">In 2014, the Sentencing Commission issued Amendment 782, which reduc\u00e9d the offense level for certain drug trafficking offenses by 2 levels. That same year, Mr. Gourdine, proceeding <em>pro se, </em>filed a motion for a reduced sentence under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) based on Amendment 782.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-7\">It is undisputed that Mr. Gourdine is eligible for a sentence reduction under Amendment 782. Based on the 2-level reduction, Mr. Gourdine\u2019s guideline range became 188 to 235 months\u2019 imprisonment. He requested that the district court consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors and reduce his sentence to 180 months. <em>See </em>D.E. 280 at 3. The district court, in a two-page form order, reduced Mr. Gourdine\u2019s sentence from 225 months\u2019 imprisonment to 215 months. <em>See </em>D.E. 301 (page 1 of the \u00a7 3682(c)(2) order); PSI (sealed page 2 of the \u00a7 3582(c)(2) order). The order does not indicate whether the district court considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. Page 1 of the order merely checks a box granting Mr. Gourdine\u2019s motion and indicates that the reduction is from 225 months to 215 months. Page 2 of the order, which is sealed, lists the initial and new advisory guideline ranges for Mr. Gourdine and states that \u201c[t]he reduced sentence is within the amended guideline range.\u201d The section on page 2 of the order for \u201cadditional comments\u201d is blank.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-9\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b894-10\">We have explained that \u201cthe district court must make two distinct determinations before deciding whether to reduce a defendant\u2019s sentence under \u00a7 3582(c)(2).\u201d <em>United States v. Vautier, </em>144 F.3d 756, 760 (11th Cir.1998). First, the district court \u201cmust, substitute the amended guideline range for the originally applied guideline range and determine what sentence it would have imposed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cSecond, ... the court must consider the factors listed in \u00a7 3553(a) and determine whether or not to reduce the defendant\u2019s original sentence.\u201d <em>Id. See also </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10 cmt. 1(B) (\u201cConsistent with 18 U.S.C. 3582(c)(2), the court shall consider the factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. 3553(a) in determining [] whether a reduction in the defendant\u2019s term of imprisonment is warranted[.]\u201d); <em>Williams, </em>557 F.3d at 1257 (same). \u201cThe district court abuses its discretion if it fails to apply the proper legal standard or to follow proper procedures in making its determination.\u201d <em>United States v. Jules, </em>595 F.3d 1239, 1241-42 (11th Cir.2010) (internal quotation marks and brackets omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b894-11\">Here, the district court partially granted Mr. Gourdine\u2019s motion for a reduced sentence in a two-page form order. The order does not indicate whether the district court considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors; in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"867\">*867</page-number>fact, it does not even mention or cite the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. And although a hearing was not required, the record does not contain transcripts from any hearings at which the district court may have considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors when ruling on Mr. Gourdine\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-5\">The government says that the district court \u201cused a form that typically would recite the court\u2019s consideration of the relevant Sentencing Guidelines and statutes.\u201d Br. for the United States at 6 n. 3. The government acknowledges, however, that such language is not included on the form order used in this case, and it believes that the language \u201cappears to have been excised accidentally.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Even if the government is correct, the fact remains that the district court\u2019s form order makes no mention of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-6\">The government argues that because Mr. Gourdine\u2019s motion for a reduced sentence set forth the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, the record shows that the district court considered the factors in granting Mr. Gour-dine\u2019s motion. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-7\">In <em>United States v. Eggersdorf, </em>126 F.3d 1318, 1322 (11th Cir.1997), we held that a district court does not abuse its discretion where the \u201crecord as a whole\u201d shows that the district court considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. In <em>Eggersdorf, </em>the district court, in its order denying resentencing, \u201cstated that it had \u2018reviewed the motions, ... the record, and [had] be[en] otherwise duly advised[.]\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>That is not the case here; all we have is a two-page order reducing Mr. Gourdine\u2019s sentence from 225 months to 215 months \u201c[u]pon motion of [] the defendant^]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b895-8\">On this record, we conclude that district court abused its discretion by failing to consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors when it reduced Mr. Gourdine\u2019s sentence by 10 months. <em>See Jules, </em>595 F.3d at 1241-42; <em>Williams, </em>557 F.3d at 1257.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-9\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b895-10\">We reverse the district court\u2019s order partially granting Mr. Gourdine\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion and remand for consideration of that motion under the factors set forth in \u00a7 3553(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b895-11\">REVERSED AND REMANDED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
