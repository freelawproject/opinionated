Ericson and Rosemary Ericson challenge Bank of America, N.A.\u2019s authority to foreclose on their property. The district court granted summary judgment in favor of Mortgage Electronic Registration Systems, Inc. (MERS), Resurgent Capital Services, L.P, (Resurgent), and Bank of America. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-9\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b371-10\">David D. Ericson obtained a home equity loan from JLM Direct Funding, Ltd. by signing a promissory note, and as security for payment of the note, Ericson and his then-spouse, Rosemary Ericson, signed a deed of trust that granted JLM a lien on property located in Spring, Texas. The deed of trust states: \u201cThe beneficiary of this Security Instrument is MERS (solely as nominee for Lender and Lender\u2019s successors and assigns) and the successors and assigns of MERS.\u201d In February 2010, MERS, as nominee for JLM and its successors and assigns, assigned the note and the deed of trust to Bank of America. In April 2012, Bank of America transferred the servicing of the loan to Resurgent Mortgage Servicing, a division of Resurgent. In July 2013, MERS, as nominee for JLM and its successors and assigns, assigned the note and the deed of trust to Resurgent.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-13\">After years of default on payments, in August 2012, Bank of America filed an application for home equity foreclosure in Texas state court, noting Resurgent as \u201cthe mortgage servicer.\u201d The state court ordered that Bank of America \u201cor their successors or assigns\u201d could proceed with the foreclosure. After receiving notice of a trustee sale, the Ericsons filed a petition for declaratory judgment and an application for a temporary restraining order against Resurgent, Bank of America, and MERS in Texas state court. The state court granted the application for a temporary restraining order. Bank of America removed the case to federal district court based on diversity jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-14\">The Ericsons\u2019 complaint was based on the argument that because MERS had no authority to assign the note and deed of trust to Bank of America, the assignment is void, and Bank of America has no right to seek foreclosure. The parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment. The district court granted summary judgment in favor of Resurgent, Bank of America, and MERS and dismissed the Ericsons\u2019 claims. The Ericsons timely appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-15\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b371-16\">We review a district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment de novo, \u201cconsidering all facts in the light most favorable to the non-moving party.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Summary judgment is appropriate \u201cif the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any mate<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>rial fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b372-4\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b372-5\">We must first address the arguments made by MERS, Bank of America, and Resurgent that the Ericsons lack standing to challenge the assignment on the ground that MERS lacked the authority to assign the deed of trust to Bank of America.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-6\">This court recognized in <em>Reinagel v. Deutsche Bank National Trust Co. </em>that, under Texas law, a debtor cannot \u201cdefend against an assignee\u2019s efforts to enforce the obligation on a ground that merely renders the assignment voidable at the election of the assignor\u201d but may defend on the ground that the assignment is void.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We further observed that, under Texas law, challenges to facially valid assignments \u201cfor want of authority\u201d may only be brought by the defrauded assignor.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Here, the assignment from MERS to Bank of America is facially valid. Accordingly, the Ericsons cannot challenge the assignment on the ground that MERS lacked authority to execute the assignment.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b372-14\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"AVQv\">The Ericsons argue that because neither Bank of America nor Resurgent is the holder or owner of the Ericsons\u2019 promissory note, they lack the authority to foreclose on the Ericsons\u2019 property. Even if the Ericsons\u2019 allegations were factually accurate, we squarely rejected this argument in <em>Martins v. BAC Home Loans Servicing, L.P., </em>in which we held that, under Texas law, \u201c[t]he party to foreclose need not possess the note <em>itself.\u201d</em><footnotemark><em>6</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b372-16\">The Ericsons also make general allegations of fraud under Tex. Civ. Prac. <em>&amp; </em>Rem.Code \u00a7 12.002<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> against MERS and</p>\n<p id=\"Ax2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>Bank of America for filing the assignment from MERS to Bank of America in the Harris County, Texas, records. As support, the Ericsons merely repeat their argument , that MERS lacked authority to execute the assignment. But the assignment from MERS to Bank of America is facially valid. This court held in <em>Martins </em>that MERS qualifies as a mortgagee under Texas law and has the power to foreclose.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> In the present case, in addition to naming MERS as the beneficiary of the deed of trust and the nominee of the lender and its successors and assigns, the deed of trust states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b373-5\">Borrower understands and agrees that MERS holds only legal title to the interests granted by Borrower in this Security Instrument, but, if necessary to comply with law or custom, MERS (as nominee for Lender and Lender\u2019s successors and assigns) has the right: to exercise any or all of those interests, including, but not limited to, the right to foreclose and sell the Property; and to take any action required of Lender including, but not limited to, releasing and canceling this Security Instrument.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b373-6\">The deed of trust unequivocally gives MERS the power to foreclose and sell the mortgaged property, and MERS could assign that power to a third party.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b373-7\">The Ericsons also argue that they are entitled to file a claim for wrongful foreclosure. To establish a claim of wrongful foreclosure, the Ericsons must show \u201c(i) \u2018a defect in the foreclosure sale proceedings\u2019; (ii) \u2018a grossly inadequate selling price\u2019; and (iii) \u2018a causal connection between the defect and the grossly inadequate selling price.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The Ericsons have produced no evidence of the second and third elements and merely repeat their arguments that MERS lacked authority to make the assignment to Bank of America and that Bank of America is not the holder of the promissory note.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-14\">For these reasons, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b371-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
