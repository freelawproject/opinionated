Cho-Ajanel raises two due process claims in his petition for review: (1) the IJ should have reopened the removal hearing because Cho-Ajanel did not receive notice thereof in his native language and (2) the BIA\u2019s summary affir-mance of the IJ\u2019s order, without opinion, deprives this court of a sufficient basis for reviewing the reasonableness of the BIA\u2019s action.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-19\">This court has previously held that \u201csections 1229(a)(1) and (b)(1) do not require notice in the alien\u2019s native language.\u201d <em>Ek Hong Djie v. Holder, </em>310 Fed.Appx. 720, 721 (5th Cir.2009). Moreover, as Cho-Ajanel correctly concedes, his argument regarding the BIA\u2019s summary affirmance procedures is foreclosed in this circuit. <em>See Soadjede v. Ashcroft, </em>324 F.3d 830, 832-33 (5th Cir.2003) (holding that BIA\u2019s summary affirmance procedures \u201cdo not deprive this court of a basis for judicial review and ... do not violate due process\u201d). Cho-Ajanel invites this court to revisit <em>Ek Hong Djie </em>and <em>Soadjede, </em>arguing that those cases fail to appreciate the extent to which the claimed deprivations <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>undermine aliens\u2019 established due process rights to notice and judicial review. We decline the invitation. <em>See Jacobs v. Nat\u2019l Drug Intelligence Ctr., </em>548 F.3d 375, 378 (5th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b463-5\">The petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b462-20\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
