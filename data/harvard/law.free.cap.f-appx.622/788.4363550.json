In his \u00a7 2241 petition in the district court, Mr. Gray argued that under the new rule announced by the Supreme Court in <em>Descamps v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 133 S.Ct. 2276, 186 L.Ed.2d 438 (2013), he is actually innocent of at least one of the predicate offenses that comprised his three \u201cserious violent felony\u201d convictions, which required the district court to sentence him to mandatory life imprisonment. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3559(c). The district court denied Mr. Gray\u2019s petition, because it concluded that <em>Descamps </em>was not retroactively applicable on collateral review and, therefore, Mr. Gray could not avail himself of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(e)\u2019s savings clause to file his \u00a7 2241 petition.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Although neither the Supreme Court nor we have decided whether <em>Des-camps </em>applies retroactively on collateral review, we affirm. After reviewing the record and the parties\u2019 briefs, we conclude that, even if <em>Descamps </em>is applicable retroactively, Mr. Gray\u2019s previous convictions qualify as \u201cserious violent felonies\u201d under \u00a7 3559(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b817-14\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b817-15\">Mr. Gray was convicted by a jury in 1999 of Hobbs Act robbery, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1951, and of using and carrying a firearm during and in relation to Hobbs Act robbery, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c). Mr. Gray previously had been convicted of robbery in 1990 and rape in 1979, both in Georgia. The district court sentenced Mr. Gray to life imprisonment for the Hobbs Act robbery and the firearm charge under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3559(c)(1), which provides that if a defendant has \u201c2 or more serious violent felonies\u201d and is then convicted of a third serious violent felony, he \u201cshall be sentenced to life imprisonment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b817-16\">At his 1999 sentencing hearing, Mr. Gray argued to the district court (and again to us on direct appeal) that his prior 1990 robbery conviction did not constitute a \u201cserious violent felony\u201d under \u00a7 3559(c). First, he did not use a \u201cfirearm or other dangerous weapon.\u201d Second, \u00a7 3559(c)(3)(A) was unconstitutional because it placed the burden on the defendant to establish that a conviction did not qualify as a serious violent felony.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The district court overruled Mr. Gray\u2019s objections at sentencing, and we affirmed on direct appeal. <em>See United States v. Gray, </em>260 F.3d 1267 (11th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b817-18\">In 2003, Mr. Gray filed a timely motion for post-conviction relief under 28 U.S.C. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"790\">*790</page-number>\u00a7 2255, alleging ineffective assistance of counsel. He then moved to supplement his \u00a7 2255 motion because, under the Supreme Court\u2019s then recent decision, in <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), a jury, rather than a judge, should be charged with determining the facts of a predicate conviction under \u00a7 3559(c). The district court denied Mr. Gray\u2019s motion to supplement and ultimately denied his \u00a7 2255 petition. Mr. Gray filed his notice to appeal, but the appeal was dismissed because he failed to pay the docketing and filing fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-4\">In 2013, Mr. Gray filed a second \u00a7 2255 motion and argued that his sentence violated the Supreme Court\u2019s new decision in <em>Descamps, </em>which should be applied retroactively on collateral review. Under <em>Des-camps, </em>Mr. Gray argued, the district court had erred in looking beyond the statute of conviction for his 1990 robbery conviction to determine whether it qualified as a \u201cserious violent felony,\u201d' Mr. Gray also argued that his rape conviction was not a valid predicate offense because the Georgia statute under which he was convicted did not require a showing of physical force, as \u00a7 3559(c) requires. The district court did not rule on the merits of Mr. Gray\u2019s motion, but dismissed it as a second and successive \u00a7 2255 motion filed without authorization from this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-5\">Mr. Gray then filed the instant \u00a7 2241 motion, claiming again that his sentence should be vacated under <em>Descamps. </em>The district court concluded that Mr. Gray had failed to establish that \u00a7 2255(e)\u2019s saving clause allowed him to bring his \u00a7 2241 petition, because <em>Descamps </em>did not apply retroactively on collateral review. On appeal, Mr. Gray argues that the district court erred because <em>Descamps </em>does apply retroactively on collateral review, and because he is \u201cactually innocent\u201d of his \u00a7 3559(c)(1) life sentence because his prior convictions do not constitute \u201cserious violent felonies.\u201d His 1990 robbery conviction, Mr. Gray claims, was not an armed robbery conviction, and his 1979 rape conviction did not qualify either, because the state failed to prove he used the physical force necessary for the offense to constitute a \u201cserious violent felony.\u201d We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b818-8\">We review whether a prisoner may bring a \u00a7 2241 petition under the savings clause of \u00a7 2255(e) <em>de novo. See Bryant v. Warden, FCC Coleman-Medium, </em>738 F.3d 1253, 1262 (11th Cir.2013). To avail himself of \u00a7 2255(e)\u2019s savings clause, a petitioner has \u201cthe burden of demonstrating that the \u00a7 2255 remedy was inadequate or ineffective to test the legality of his detention.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Turner v. Warden, </em>709 F.3d 1328, 1333 (11th Cir.2013)). We have said that \u00a7 2255(e)\u2019s savings clause \u201cmight apply to some claims involving a \u2018fundamental defect\u2019 in sentencing where the petitioner had not had an opportunity to obtain judicial correction of that defect earlier [but now has an opportunity] ... based upon a retroactively applicable Supreme Court decision overturning circuit precedent.\u201d <em>Wofford v. Scott, </em>177 F.3d 1236, 1244-45 (11th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b818-9\">In <em>Bryant, </em>we specifically held that \u00a7 2255(e)\u2019s savings clause permitted a \u00a7 2241 petition where a petitioner\u2019s sentence exceeded the otherwise applicable statutory maximum sentence due to a sentencing enhancement under the Armed Career Criminal Act, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e). The enhancement was based on a prior conviction which later precedent established was not a violent felony under the Armed Career Criminal Act. <em>Bryant, </em>738 F.3d at 1256-57. We assume without deciding here that the same holds true for similar enhancements under \u00a7 3559(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b819-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"791\">*791</page-number>In <em>Descamps, </em>the Supreme Court, on direct appeal, held that courts could not apply a \u201cmodified categorical approach\u201d under the ACCA to look beyond the statutory elements of a prior conviction when the statutory predicate offense involved a single, indivisible set of elements. 133 S.Ct. at 2281-82. Mr. Gray argues here, that like ACCA, which \u201cincreases the sentences of certain federal defendants who have three prior convictions\u201d for violent felonies, \u00a7 3559(c)\u2019s \u201cthree strikes\u201d provision is also subject to <em>Descamps\u2019 </em>\u201cmodified categorical approach,\u201d which prohibits a sentencing court from looking beyond the elements of a defendant\u2019s prior conviction for sentencing purposes when the statute contains indivisible elements.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-4\">Although the district court dismissed Mr. Gray\u2019s motion because it found <em>Des-camps </em>did not apply retroactively on collateral review, neither the Supreme Court nor we have decided yet whether <em>Des-camps </em>applies retroactively on collateral review. We do not need to decide this question today, because even assuming <em>Descamps </em>applies retroactively on collateral review, Mr. Gray\u2019s robbery and rape convictions would nonetheless constitute \u201cserious violent felonies\u201d under \u00a7 3559(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b819-5\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b819-6\">Mr. Gray\u2019s 1979 rape conviction constitutes a \u201cserious violent felony\u201d under \u00a7 3559(c). In relevant part, \u00a7 3559(c) explicitly provides that \u201cassault with intent to commit rape\u201d is a \u201cserious violent felony.\u201d. <em>See </em>\u00a7 3559(e)(2)(F)(i). Mr. Gray argues that the state failed to prove he used the physical force necessary for the offense to constitute a serious violent felony. But rape, under \u00a7 3559(c)(2)(F)\u00a9 contains no threshold force requirement. The statute provides that assault with intent to commit rape, aggravated sexual abuse and sexual abuse, and abusive sexual contact are \u201cserious violent felonies\u201d under \u00a7 3559(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b819-8\">According to Mr. Gray\u2019s presentencing report, a jury convicted him of forcibly raping a woman against her will. Because Mr. Gray did not object to the characterization of his rape conviction in the report or at the sentencing hearing, he is deemed to have admitted that he forcibly raped a woman against her will. <em>See United States v. Bennett, </em>472 F.3d 825, 833-34 (11th Cir.2006) (\u201cthe facts of prior convictions [ ] contained in [a] PSI ... are deemed to have been admitted\u201d if not objected to) (citing <em>United States v. Wade, </em>458 F.3d 1273, 1277 (11th Cir.2006)). <em>See also United States v. Davis, </em>587 F.3d 1300, 1303-04 (11th Cir.2009) (\u201c[The defendant] was deemed to have admitted, for sentencing purposes, the facts in the PSI he did not object to clearly and specifically at sentencing.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b819-9\">Georgia\u2019s rape statute, moreover, is divisible and provides that a person is guilty of rape \u201cwhen he has carnal knowledge of\u2019 either \u201c[a] female forcibly against her will\u201d or \u201c[a] female who is less than ten years of age.\u201d Ga. Stat. \u00a7 16-6-1 (1933). When a statute is divisible, <em>Descamps\u2019 </em>prohibition against a \u201cmodified categorical approach\u201d does not apply. <em>See United States v. Howard, </em>742 F.3d 1334, 1338 (11th Cir.2014). <em>Descamps </em>would, therefore, not provide a \u00a7 2255(e) savings clause remedy for Mr. Gray\u2019s claim that the rape conviction is not a qualifying offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-10\">In an event, because Mr. Gray was convicted of raping a woman forcibly against her will, under Ga. Stat. \u00a7 16-6-1, this constitutes a \u201cserious violent felony\u201d under \u00a7 3559(C)(2)(F)\u00ae. <em>See also Gray, </em>260 F.3d at 1277. Furthermore, \u00a7 3559(c)(2)(F)\u00a9 cites 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241(c), which provides that attempting or engaging in sex with a child who is less than 12 years of age also qualifies as a \u201cserious <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"792\">*792</page-number>violent felony\u201d under \u00a7 3559(c). Therefore, even if Mr. Gray had been convicted under the other prong of Georgia\u2019s rape statute, his conviction would nevertheless have been a qualifying predicate offense under \u00a7 3559(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b820-4\">In sum, we reject Mr. Gray\u2019s argument that his rape conviction does not constitute a \u201cserious violent felony\u201d under \u00a7 3559(c). We, therefore, now turn to whether Mr. Gray\u2019s 1990 robbery conviction constituted a \u201cserious violent felony.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b820-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b820-6\">Mr. Gray\u2019s 1990 robbery conviction also constitutes a \u201cserious violent felony\u201d under \u00a7 3559(c). \u201c[T]he term \u2018serious violent felony1 means ... robbery as described in [18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 ] 2111, 2113, or 2118.\u201d These referenced sections of the U.S.Code include regular robbery, bank robbery, and robberies and burglaries involving controlled substances. Importantly, robbery is defined as \u201ctakpng] or attempting] to take from the person or presence of another anything of value ... by force and violence, or by intimidation.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2111. Generally, therefore, all robberies are serious violent felonies under \u00a7 3559(c). But \u00a7 3559(c)(3)(A) provides defendants with an escape clause or affirmative defense to dispute whether their robbery conviction qualified as a predicate felony under the statute. <em>See Gray, </em>260 F.3d at 1278 (\u201cSpecifically, the three strikes statute contains a disqualification provision, or an affirmative defense that provides a defendant with the opportunity to prove that an otherwise qualifying conviction does not constitute a \u2018strike\u2019 under the statute.\u201d). <em>See also United States v. Davis, </em>260 F.3d 965 (8th Cir.2001) (describing \u00a7 3559(c)(3)(A) as an affirmative defense available to defendants to prove their prior robbery conviction did not qualify for the sentencing enhancement). If a defendant can \u201cestablish[] by clear and convincing evidence that no firearm or other dangerous weapon was used in the offense and no threat of use of a firearm or other dangerous weapon was involved in the offense,\u201d and \u201cthe offense did not result in death or serious bodily harm ... to any person,\u201d his robbery conviction does not qualify as a \u201cserious violent felony\u201d under the statute. \u00a7 3559(c)(3)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b820-8\">Mr. Gray argues that at sentencing the district court violated <em>Descamps </em>because it looked beyond the statutory definition of his Georgia robbery conviction to determine that he had used a dangerous weapon during the robbery. Mr. Gray misreads \u00a7 3559(c)(3)(A). Robberies, under \u00a7 3559(c), are by definition serious violent felonies. It was Mr. Gray\u2019s burden, not the government\u2019s, to establish by clear and convincing evidence that his prior robbery conviction did not qualify as a serious violent felony under \u00a7 3559(c)(3)(A). As a result, the district court had no need to go beyond the statute of his conviction to establish that the conviction was a \u201cserious violent felony.\u201d Rather, it was Mr. Gray who had to establish that he did not employ a firearm or other dangerous weapon. <em>Descamps </em>did not prohibit Mr. Gray from trying to make this showing.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-9\">Even if <em>Descamps </em>were to apply retroactively, it does not apply to \u00a7 3559(c)(3)(A) or Mr. Gray\u2019s case. <em>See United States v. Mackovich, </em>209 F.3d 1227, 1238-41 (10th Cir.2000) (discussing how <em>Taylor v. United States, </em>495 U.S. 575, 110 S.Ct. 2143, 109 L.Ed.2d 607 (1990), which held that district courts at sentencing could not go beyond the statutory definitions of the prior offenses to the particular facts underlying those convictions for purposes of the Armed Career Criminal Act, did not apply to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3559(c)(3)(A)).</p>\n<p id=\"b821-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"793\">*793</page-number>Unlike \u00a7 924(e) of the ACCA, \u00a7 3559(c)(3)(A) unambiguously provides that a prior robbery will not qualify as a predicate offense if a defendant can clearly and convincingly establish that \u201cno firearm or other dangerous weapon was involved in the offense\u201d and \u201cthe offense did not result in death or serious bodily injury.\u201d This language requires a sentencing court to look to the underlying facts of the offense in order to determine whether the defendant can prove his robbery conviction was a non-qualifying offense. Where \u00a7 924(e) directs sentencing courts to look to the elements of conviction, \u00a7 3559(c)(3)(A) allows them to look at the underlying facts. We, therefore, do not believe <em>Descamps </em>is applicable to \u00a7 3559(c)(3)(A)\u2019s non-qualification analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-5\">Moreover, we have previously stated that \u00a7 2255(e)\u2019s savings clause does not provide an avenue for a \u00a7 2241 petition based on the extension of a Supreme Court decision. <em>See Flint v. Jordan, </em>514 F.3d 1165, 1167 (11th Cir.2008). Here, Mr. Gray not only asks us to find that <em>Des-camps </em>applies retroactively on collateral review, but also to extend to <em>Descamps\u2019 </em>holding to the statutory language in \u00a7 3559(c)(3)(A). For the reasons stated above, we believe that \u00a7\u00a7 924(e) and 3559(c)(3)(A) are different. Therefore, even if <em>Descamps </em>applies retroactively on collateral review, it does not apply to \u00a7 3559(c)(3)(A) or Mr. Gray\u2019s current \u00a7 2241 petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b821-7\">We affirm the district court\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"AO_K\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b817-12\">. The proper disposition, given the district court\u2019s conclusion, would have been for the district court to dismiss Mr. Gray's petition, rather than to deny relief. <em>See Darby v. Hawk-Sawyer, </em>405 F.3d 942, 945-46 (11th Cir.2005). This, however, does not impede our ability to review the district court\u2019s disposition of Mr. Gray\u2019s petition.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b817-20\">.
