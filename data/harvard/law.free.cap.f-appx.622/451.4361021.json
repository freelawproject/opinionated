Cozby, </em>813 F.2d 659, 660 (5th Cir.1987). A timely notice of appeal is a jurisdictional requirement in a civil case. <em>Bowles v. Russell, </em>551 U.S. 205, 214, 127 S.Ct. 2360, 168 L.Ed.2d 96 (2007). Hernandez had 30 days, or until September 3, 2014, to file a timely notice of appeal. <em>See </em>Fed, R.App. P. 4(a)(1)(A). He did not file a notice of appeal until after the appeal period expired. He also does not certify that he placed his notice of appeal in the prison mail system \u201con or before the last day for filing.\u201d <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 25(a)(2)(C). Indeed, his COA itself is dated after the 30-day deadline. Because Hernandez did not file a timely notice of appeal, this appeal is dismissed for lack of jurisdiction. <em>See Bowles, </em>551 U.S. at 214, 127 S.Ct. 2360.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-22\">COA DENIED; APPEAL DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b479-20\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
