Trujeque-Novelo argues that that the 54-month sentence is substantively unreasonable because it is greater than necessary to achieve the sentencing goals of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). Specifically, Trujeque-Novelo contends that the district court assigned too much weight to his dated criminal history, failed to consider his avoidance of non-immigration offenses since 1995, and did not ad\u00e9quately consider his age of 65.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-22\">We review the district court\u2019s non-Guidelines sentence for abuse of discretion under the totality of the circumstances. <em>See Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007); <em>United States v. Gerezano-Rosales, </em>692 F.3d 393, 400 (5th Cir.2012). The record reflects that the district court properly considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. The district court acknowledged Trujeque-Nove-lo\u2019s argument that some of his convictions were dated and noted that his age is a factor it usually considers in favor of mitigation. The district court, nevertheless, determined that an upward variance was appropriate to address Trujeque-Novelo\u2019s underrepresented criminal history category and \u201cpattern of recidivism.\u201d Trujeque-Novelo had 15 prior convictions, including two convictions for aggravated assault with a deadly weapon and seven immigration-related convictions. Two lengthy sentences for prior convictions of illegal reentry following deportation did not deter Trujeque-Novelo from committing the same crime again. Under the totality of the circumstances, the district court did not abuse its discretion in imposing this sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-23\">AFFIRMED. .</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b481-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
