Smith was sentenced to 138 months\u2019 imprisonment after pleading guilty to a cocaine-trafficking-conspiracy offense. No reversible error has been shown; we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-25\">We review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s legal conclusions about the scope of its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"884\">*884</page-number>authority under section 3582(c)(2). <em>United States v. Lawson, </em>686 F.3d 1317, 1319 (11th Cir.2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b912-4\">A district court ordinarily may not modify a defendant\u2019s term of imprisonment once it has been imposed. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c). A district court may, however, reduce a defendant\u2019s sentence if the term of imprisonment was \u201cbased on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 3582(c)(2); see <em>also </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(a)(l). We have said that \u201cthe statutory provision, the Sentencing Commission\u2019s corresponding policy statement, and the commentary to that policy statement all make it clear that a court cannot use an amendment to reduce a sentence in a particular case unless that amendment actually lowers the guidelines range in that case.\u201d <em>United States v. Hamilton, </em>715 F.3d 328, 337 (11th Cir.2013). The defendant bears the burden of establishing that a retroactive amendment actually lowers his guideline range. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b912-5\">The district court committed no error in denying Smith a sentence reduction based on Amendment 782. Under the Guidelines in effect at the time of Smith\u2019s original sentencing, a drug quantity of 150 kilograms or more of cocaine resulted in a base offense level of 38. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(c)(l) (2012). As a result of Amendment 782, the Guidelines now provide that a drug quantity of 450 kilograms or more of cocaine results in a base offense level of 38. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(c)(l) (2014). At no point, however, has Smith disputed that he was responsible for at least 1,100 kilograms of cocaine.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-8\">Applying retroactively Amendment 782 to Smith\u2019s case, Smith\u2019s base offense level remains 38 because Smith was responsible for more than 450 kilograms of cocaine. <em>See id. </em>Retroactive application of Amendment 782 results in no change to Smith\u2019s guidelines sentencing range; no sentence reduction is authorized under section 3582(c)(2). <em>See Hamilton, </em>715 F.3d at 337.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b912-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b912-6\"> Because Smith is, as a matter of law, ineligible for a sentence reduction under section 3582(c)(2), the district court lacked discretion to modify his sentence. Thus, the district court committed no error in failing to consider the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors or Smith\u2019s downward departure for substantial assistance. <em>Cf. United States v. Bravo, </em>203 F.3d 778, 780-81 (11th Cir.2000) (after determining that a guidelines amendment lowers the defendant's guidelines range, a district court must then consider the section 3553(a) factors in determining \u2014 in its discretion \u2014 whether to impose a newly calculated sentence or to retain defendant's original sentence).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
