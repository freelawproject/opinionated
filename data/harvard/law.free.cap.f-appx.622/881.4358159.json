After careful review of the record and the parties\u2019 briefs, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-8\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b910-9\">We assume the parties are familiar with the background of this case. Thus, we summarize the proceedings and facts only insofar as necessary to provide context for our decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-10\">Mr. Vasiloff filed a \u00a7 2255 motion to vacate his sentence in January of 2010, raising 12 claims. In ground six of the motion, he alleged that it was multiplici-tous for more than one \u201cproduction\u201d count to be chai\u2019ged for a single \u201cphoto-shoot.\u201d The district court denied the \u00a7 2255 motion, ruling that Mr. Vasiloffs claims were barred by his knowing and voluntary appeal waiver and otherwise without merit. The district court also denied Mr. Vasi-loffs motion for a COA and <em>in forma pauperis </em>status on' appeal. This Court granted Mr. Vasiloffs motion for IFP status, and issued a COA on the following issues: (1) Whether Mr. Vasiloffs claim that the indictment was multiplicitous was barred by his guilty plea or the appeal waiver; and (2) if not, whether the indictment was multiplicitous.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-12\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b910-13\">We review a district court\u2019s legal conclusions in a \u00a7 2255 proceeding <em>de novo </em>and its factual findings for clear error. <em>Lynn v. United States., </em>365 F.3d 1225, 1232 (11th Cir.2004). This Court construes <em>pro se </em>pleadings liberally. <em>See Tannenbaum v. United States </em>148 F.3d 1262, 1263 (11th Cir.1998). We limit our review of Mr. Vasiloffs appeal to those issues specified in the COA. <em>See Murray v. United States, </em>145 F.3d 1249, 1250-51 (11th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b910-14\">We have repeatedly held that the failure to raise the issue of multiplicity before trial waives the issue on appeal with regard to error in the indictment. <em>See United States v. Pacchioli, </em>718 F.3d 1294, 1308 (11th Cir.2013); <em>United States v. Mastrangelo, </em>733 F.2d 793, 800 (11th Cir.1984). <em>See also </em>Fed.R.Crim.P. 12(b)(3)(B)(ii) (stating that motions that must be made before trial are those with \u201ca defect in the indictment or information, including: ... (ii) charging the same offense in more than one count (multiplicity)\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b910-15\">On the other hand, the failure to raise a jurisdictional defect in the indictment before trial does not waive the issue. <em>See United States v. Peter, </em>310 F.3d 709, 712 (11th Cir.2002) (\u201cJurisdictional error implicates a court\u2019s power to adjudicate the matter before it, such error can never be waived by parties to litigation.\u201d). But not all defects in an indictment are jurisdictional. <em>See United States v. Cotton, </em>535 U.S. 625, 631, 122 S.Ct. 1781, 152 L.Ed.2d 860 (2002). Rather, \u201c[a]n indictment\u2019s relationship to jurisdiction is ... based on whether it alleges conduct which constitutes a federal offense, not on some intrinsic value of an indictment as such.\u201d <em>United States v. McIntosh, </em>704 F.3d 894, 903 (11th Cir.2013) (alterations added).</p>\n<p id=\"b911-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"883\">*883</page-number>Here, Mr. Vasiloffs guilty plea, given that it admitted all the elements of the formal criminal charges, waived all non-jurisdictional defects in his proceedings. <em>See United States v. Jackson, </em>659 F.2d 78, 74 (5th Cir.1981). Therefore, the issue is whether the multiplicity argument raised on appeal constitutes a jurisdictional challenge.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-5\">Mr. Vasiloff argues that the 21 photographs he took cannot serve as the basis for the 21 counts under \u00a7 2251(a) because these photographs were not part of 21 separate shooting sessions. Because his argument challenges the facts, his claim is not jurisdictional in nature and is barred by his guilty plea. <em>See United States v. Johnson, </em>89 F.3d 778, 784 (11th Cir.1996) (holding that a defendant\u2019s factual basis challenge presents a non-jurisdictional defect and, as such, is waived by a guilty plea). During the plea colloquy, the district court specifically pointed out each count to Mr. Vasiloff, the corresponding punishments associated with each count, and asked if he understood. Mr. Vasiloff responded that he did. <em>See </em>D.E. 27 at 11-12.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-6\">The result is the same even if we assume that Mr. Vasiloffs claim implicates the double jeopardy clause. Mr. Vasiloff waived his double jeopardy challenge when he pled guilty to 21 separate violations of \u00a7 2251(a) for which he may have been lawfully prosecuted. <em>See United States v. Smith, </em>532 F.3d 1125, 1129-30 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b911-7\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b911-8\">For the reasons stated above, we affirm the district court\u2019s denial of Mr. Vasiloffs \u00a7 2255 motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
