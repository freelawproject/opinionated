HIGGINSON, Circuit Judge: <footnotemark>*</footnotemark></author>\n<p id=\"b482-16\">Antoine Earl Powell, federal prisoner # 56875-180, seeks leave to proceed in for-ma pauperis (IFP) on appeal from the district court\u2019s denial of his motion to reduce his sentence pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). By moving to proceed IFP, Powell challenges the district court\u2019s certification decision that his appeal was not taken in good faith. <em>See Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997). Our inquiry is limited to whether Powell has demonstrated good faith by raising any non-frivolous issue, meaning one arguable on its merits. <em>Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 220 (5th Cir.1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b482-21\">In 2006, Powell was convicted of aiding and abetting possession with intent to distribute at least 50 grams of crack cocaine (count one) and aiding and abetting possession of a firearm during the commission of a drug-trafficking crime (count two). He was sentenced to 151 months on count one, to run consecutively to a 60-month sentence on count two. Powell\u2019s sentence was subsequently reduced, pursuant to \u00a7 3582(c)(2), to the statutory minimum sentence of 120 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-22\">Powell argues that he is entitled to a reduction of his sentence because the Government breached the plea agreement, the district court committed procedural errors at sentencing, and Amendment 782 to the United States Sentencing Guidelines\u2014 which reduced the offense levels for-various drug offenses \u2014 applies retroactively to his case. He further asserts that his sentence was substantively unreasonable and based on facts that he did not admit and that the government did not prove.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-23\">Section 3582(c)(2) permits a district court to reduce a sentence that was \u201cbased on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d <em>United States v. Doublin, </em>572 F.3d 235, 237 (5th Cir.2009). Powell\u2019s Amendment 782 argument has no merit because the district court lacked authority to reduce his sentence below the ten-year statutory minimum. <em>See United States v. Carter, </em>595 F.3d 575, 578-81 (5th Cir.2010); <em>United States v. Mosley, </em>403 Fed.Appx. 934, 935 (5th Cir.2010); <em>see also </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841 (b)(l)(A)(iii) (2006). Powell\u2019s remaining proffered issues are not arguable on their merits because a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>motion may not be used to challenge \u201cthe appropriateness of the original sentence.\u201d <em>United States v. Whitebird, </em>55 F.3d 1007, 1011 (5th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b483-5\">No. 15-50568</p>\n<p id=\"b483-6\">Powell fails to demonstrate a nonfrivo-lous issue for appeal. Accordingly, his motion for leave to proceed IFP is DENIED, and the appeal is DISMISSED as frivolous. <em>See Baugh, </em>117 F.3d at 202 <em>&amp; </em>n. 24; 5th Cir. R. 42.2. His motion for immediate release is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b482-17\">Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, .the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
