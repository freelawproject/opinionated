HIGGINSON, Circuit Judge: <footnotemark>*</footnotemark></author>\n<p id=\"b460-21\">Marlon Ramos is a native and citizen of Honduras who entered the United States on December 25, 1995, without being inspected. Ramos conceded that he was deportable and filed an application for asylum and withholding of deportation. He failed to appear at the April 1, 1996 hearing on his applications for relief, however, and the immigration judge \u25a0 (IJ) ordered him deported to Honduras in absentia. Ramos did not report for deportation in June 1996 as ordered, and he was arrested in Auburn, Washington, on March 9, 2011. Ramos then filed two motions to reopen his case; both were denied as untimely.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-22\">On November 7, 2013, Ramos filed a third motion to reopen his case to allow him to apply for asylum. Ramos supported that motion with a declaration stating that he feared returning to Honduras because of an ongoing land-ownership dispute between his family and a local politician, who Ramos believes was involved in the 1999 murder of his father and a 2007 attempt on his brother\u2019s life. The IJ found that Ramos\u2019s motion was based not on evidence of \u201cchanged country conditions\u201d in Honduras, but on alleged changes in personal circumstances. The Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) dismissed Ramos\u2019s appeal, noting that the land dispute <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>began in 1994, before Ramos\u2019s hearing. The BIA also concluded that Ramos failed to demonstrate prima facie eligibility for asylum on any protected ground. Ramos seeks review of the BIA\u2019s dismissal of his appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-5\">We review the denial of a motion to reopen \u201cunder a highly deferential abuse-of-discretion standard.\u201d <em>Zhao v. Gonzales, </em>404 F.3d 295, 303 (5th Cir.2005). The BIA\u2019s decision must be upheld as long as it is not \u201ccapricious, racially invidious, utterly without foundation in the evidence, or otherwise so irrational that it is arbitrary rather than the result of any perceptible rational approach.\u201d <em>Singh v. Gonzales, </em>436 F.3d 484, 487 (5th Cir.2006) (citation omitted). \u201c[M]otions to reopen deportation proceedings are \u2018disfavored,\u2019 and the moving party bears a \u2018heavy burden.\u2019\u201d <em>Altamirano-Lopez v. Gonzales, </em>435 F.3d 547, 549-50 (5th Cir.2006) (quoting <em>INS v. Abudu, </em>485 U.S. 94, 107-10, 108 S.Ct. 904, 99 L.Ed.2d 90 (1988)).</p>\n<p id=\"b461-6\">Under the governing law at the time of Ramos\u2019s merits hearing, a petitioner may file only one motion to reopen, and must generally do so within ninety days of the deportation order. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.23(b)(1). As noted, Ramos appeals the denial of his third motion to reopen, filed more than a decade after his hearing. Those time and number limits do not apply, however, to motions to reopen in order to apply for asylum based on \u201cchanged country conditions arising in the country of nationality or the country to which removal has been ordered, if such evidence is material and was not available and could not have been discovered or presented at the previous proceeding.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1003.23(b)(4)(i). To determine whether country conditions have materially changed, we compare the evidence of country conditions submitted with the motion to the conditions at the time of the merits hearing. <em>Matter of S-Y-G, </em>24 I. &amp; N. Dec. 247, 253-54 (BIA 2007);. <em>see also Panjwani v. Gonzales, </em>401 F.3d 626, 632-33 (5th Cir.2005). If the motion is not time- or number-barred, the alien still must \u201cmake a prima facie showing that there is a reasonable likelihood that the relief sought would be granted at the reopened hearing.\u201d <em>Marcello v. INS, </em>694 F.2d 1033, 1035 (5th Cir.1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b461-8\">The materials Ramos offers do not establish that the BIA abused its discretion in concluding that country conditions in Honduras have not materially changed since his 1996 hearing. Indeed, his evidence pertains to the continuation of a land-ownership dispute that began in 1994 \u2014 before Ramos came to the United States \u2014 and to general corruption and violence in Honduras. <em>See Zhao v. Gonzales, </em>440 F.3d 405, 407 (7th Cir.2005) (holding that changed personal circumstances do not justify a motion to reopen); <em>cf. Ugochukwu v. Holder, </em>547 Fed.Appx. 522, 523 (5th Cir.2013) (despite post-hearing burning of family home, petitioner did not show country conditions were materially different from those at the time of his hearing); <em>Thomas v. Holder, </em>396 Fed.Appx. 60, 61 (5th Cir.2010) (holding that political corruption and gang violence that had been occurring in Jamaica since the 1960s did not represent changed country conditions). Nor did the BIA abuse its discretion in concluding that Ramos failed to establish a prima facie case for the relief sought, as he did not explain how the land-ownership dispute created a well-founded fear of persecution linked to his membership in a statutorily protected group. <em>See Ontunez-Tursios v. Ashcroft, </em>303 F.3d 341, 352-53 (5th Cir.2002) (alien did not show landownership dispute was motivated by any protected ground). For these reasons, Ramos\u2019s petition for review of the BIA\u2019s decision is DENIED.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>Ramos has also filed a motion for clarification requesting reasons for this court\u2019s denial of his prior motion for a stay of deportation. That motion, which is not supported by legal authority or substantive argument, is DENIED. And because Ramos has already been removed from the United States, his renewed motion for a stay of deportation is DENIED AS MOOT. <em>See Jean v. Gonzales, </em>452 F.3d 392, 395 (5th Cir.2006) (noting that request for stay was moot because petitioner had already been removed).</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b460-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
