He was sentenced to 12-months\u2019 imprisonment and three-years\u2019 supervised release for each count. In 2015, following the second revocation of his supervised release, the district court sentenced McGee to an above-Guidelines sentence of 24-months\u2019 imprisonment. McGee challenges his sentence, contending the court erred by inadequately explaining the reasons for the upward variance.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-21\"><em>Post-Booker, </em>the Guidelines are advisory only, and a properly preserved objection to an ultimate sentence is reviewed for reasonableness. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). <em>Booker, </em>however, concerned a Guidelines sentence imposed pursuant to a conviction, not a violation of supervised release. <em>United States v. Miller, </em>634 F.3d 841, 842-43 (5th Cir.2011). Therefore, even <em>post-Booker, </em>revocation sentences are reviewed under the plainly-unreasonable standard of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(a)(4). <em>Id. </em>at 843. As McGee concedes, he did not raise this issue in district court; therefore, review is only for plain error. <em>United States v. Whitelaw, </em>580 F.3d 256, 259-60 (5th Cir.2009). Under this standard, McGee must show a forfeited plain (clear or obvious) error that affected his substantial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>rights. <em>E.g., Puckett v. United States, </em>556 U.S. 129, 135, 129 S.Ct. 1423, 173 L.Ed.2d 266 (2009). If he does so, we have the discretion to correct the error, but should do so only if it seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of the proceedings. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b469-5\">McGee has not shown the requisite \u201cclear\u201d or \u201cobvious\u201d error. The court stated it imposed a 24-month sentence due to the need for deterrence and protection. It was proper for the court to consider these factors. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e); 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(B), (C). Nothing in the record suggests McGee would have received a different sentence had the court provided more reasons for its choice. <em>See United States v. Davis, </em>602 F.3d 643, 647 (5th Cir.2010). Finally, McGee\u2019s collateral assertion that the record does not permit meaningful appellate review is unavailing.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b468-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
