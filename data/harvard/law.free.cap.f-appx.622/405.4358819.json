The district court denied her initial appeal. We AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-6\">In May 2006, Garcia fell and injured her back while working in the gardening department at Walmart.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> She soon sought medical treatment, reporting \u201csharp, shooting, and burning\u201d back pain.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Her doctors noted tenderness in her lumbar region,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and she was eventually diagnosed with lumbar disc displacement.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Soon after her initial diagnosis, she started physical therapy, which was not effective in remedying her lower back pain.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> She continued treatment through 2006 and into 2007, however, and was given two lumbar epidural steroid injections, which, along with several other medications, were relatively effective in controlling her pain.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Garcia had several follow-up visits throughout 2008, where her doctor noted that her pain medications had \u201cbeen able to control her pain fairly well,\u201d and \u201callow[ed] her to live a more functional lifestyle.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b435-7\">In January 2010, Garcia applied for disability insurance; shortly after, she saw two doctors, and her records were reviewed by a third.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> First, she saw Dr. Oscar Oandasan about ten times between March 2010 and August 2011.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Dr. Oanda-san wrote that Garcia reported that she had continued pain and tenderness in her lower back, and that her MRI indicated that she had several bulging discs in her lumbar region.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> In March 2011, Dr. Oan-dasan filled out a single-page physical capacity questionnaire, indicating that Garcia could stand or walk \u201cless than 2 [hours]\u201d per day, could only occasionally lift ten pounds, and could never lift twenty pounds or more.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Next, in April 2010, Garcia was seen by Dr. William Culver for a comprehensive consultative evaluation. Dr. Cul-ver reported that her \u201cmovements were decreased, particularly to the lower back,\u201d and she had some pain, but \u201ccould heel and toe walk, and squat and rise without difficulty.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> He also opined that Garcia \u201ccan perform the majority of her [activities of daily living], but will have difficulty with heavy household chores.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Finally, in May 2010, Garcia\u2019s medical records were reviewed by Dr. Andrea Fritz, who indicated that Garcia could stand up to six hours per eight-hour work day, could occasionally lift 20 pounds, and could frequently lift ten pounds.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b435-14\">During this time, Garcia\u2019s disability application continued. Her initial claim was denied, and she requested a hearing before <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>an administrative law judge (ALJ).<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> After a hearing, where Garcia testified, the administrative law judge again denied her claim.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> He concluded that Garcia \u201chas the residual functional capacity to perform light work,\u201d<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> and \u201c[considering the claimant\u2019s age, education, work experience, and residual functional capacity, there are jobs that exist in significant numbers in the national economy that the claimant can perform.\u201d<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> These included working as a call out operator, charge account clerk, and systems monitor, all of which are sedentary unskilled jobs.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Garcia applied to the agency\u2019s Appeals Council, which concluded that there was no basis for review.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b436-4\">Garcia appealed to the district court, and the case was referred to Magistrate Judge Stacy. In a comprehensive opinion, she recommended that the district court affirm the agency\u2019s decision.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> The district court did so, and adopted Judge Stacy\u2019s recommendations in full.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> This timely appeal follows.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-6\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-7\">\u201cOur review of the Commissioner\u2019s decision is limited to two inquiries: (1) whether the decision is supported by substantial evidence on the record as a whole, and (2) whether the Commissioner applied the proper legal standard.\u201d<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> \u201cSubstantial evidence is \u2018such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> It is \u201cmore than a mere scintilla and less than a preponderance.\u201d <footnotemark>25</footnotemark> Our task as a reviewing court is narrow: we must \u201cscrutinizef ] the record to determine whether such evidence is present,\u201d but do not reweigh the evidence, evaluate conflicts of evidence, or substitute our judgment for that of the agency.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> \u201cIf the Commissioner\u2019s fact findings are supported by substantial evidence, they are conclusive.\u201d<footnotemark>27</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b436-18\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"AoQ\">Garcia raises four objections. In light of the demanding standard of review she must summit, none persuade.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-20\">First, Garcia argues that the agency erred in relying on the April 2010 consultative report provided by Dr. Culver. She posits that this report was flawed, because Dr. Culver did not have the raw radiology images of her back. Dr. Culver, however, was provided and relied upon a radiological report on Garcia\u2019s spine.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> Ultimately, Garcia\u2019s argument comes down to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>the weight the ALJ places on Dr. Culver\u2019s report \u2014 and it is the ALJ\u2019s task, not ours, to weigh evidence.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> Our circuit has not established a rule categorically excluding medical reports if they use (or fail to use) certain methods; rather, we have held the opposite: stating that the ALJ may place \u201cless weight, little weight, or. even no weight\u201d on a report if it includes \u201cstatements that are brief and conclusory, not supported by medically acceptable clinical laboratory diagnostic techniques, or otherwise unsupported by the evidence.\u201d<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> While the ALJ might have been within his rights to place less weight on a medical report that was based in part on a radiological report, rather than raw images, we cannot conclude that he erred by crediting Dr. Culver\u2019s report as he did. Garcia also argues that she had no opportunity to cross-examine Dr. Culver. However, she had the right to subpoena him, but never exercised that right by requesting his testimony before the hearing.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> She cannot object now.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-5\">Second, Garcia argues that the ALJ failed to consider her subjective reports of chronic back, hip, and knee pain when evaluating whether she was disabled. \u201cSince pain alone or in conjunction with other impairments can give rise to a disability, the ALJ must consider subjective evidence of pain as testified to by the claimant; failure to give consideration to the subjective evidence of pain and disability as testified to by the plaintiff is reversible error.\u201d<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> In this case, however, the ALJ considered Garcia\u2019s reports of pain, but determined that \u201cthe claimant\u2019s subjective complaints are inconsistent with the objective medical evidence\u201d and Garcia\u2019s own assessment of her reported daily activities.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> Under our court\u2019s precedent, so long as the ALJ gave due consideration to Garcia\u2019s report of her pain \u2014 and he did\u2014 his eventual functional determination was not reversible error.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b437-13\">Third, Garcia challenges the hypothetical question posed by the ALJ to the vocational expert. Because the hypothetical summarized the ALJ\u2019s assessment of Garcia\u2019s functional capacity, we construe her argument as a challenge to his finding of her physical capabilities.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b437-14\">After reviewing Garcia\u2019s medical record and examining her personally, the ALJ posed the following hypothetical to the vocational expert:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b437-15\">[Wje\u2019ve got a younger individual. She\u2019s got a limited education. I find she\u2019s literate. Exertional ability to occasionally lift 20 pounds, 10 pounds frequently. Sitting ability six of eight. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>Walking/standing four of eight. Push, pull, and gross/fine is unlimited, except occasional pushing with the lower extremities bilaterally. Frequent use of the hands bilaterally. Occasional stairs, no ladders, ropes, scaffolds or running. Can occasionally bend, stoop, crouch, crawl, balance, and twist. No squatting given her left knee issue. Limited exposure to dust, fumes, gases, and chemicals, heights, dangerous machinery, uneven surfaces. There\u2019s no mental impairment. Okay, based on those elements, what kind of work, if any, could be completed?<footnotemark>36</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b438-4\">In essence, the ALJ adopted a functional assessment consistent of the report of Dr. Culver, who performed a consultative evaluation, rather than the one-page form provided Dr. Oandasan, Garcia\u2019s treating physician. Garcia argues this choice was reversible error. We cannot agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-5\">\u201c[T]he opinions, diagnoses, and medical evidence of a treating physician who is familiar with the claimant\u2019s injuries, treatments, and responses should be accorded considerable weight in determining disability.\u201d<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> This is not an ironclad rule, and such opinions can be disregarded if they are \u201cbrief and conclusory, not supported by medieally acceptable clinical laboratory diagnostic techniques, or otherwise unsupported by the evidence.\u201d<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> Ultimately, the ALJ retains the \u201csole responsibility for determining the claimant\u2019s disability status.\u201d<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> Here, the ALJ determined that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AX6\">Dr. Oandasan\u2019s opinion [that Garcia can only lift 10 pounds and can sit for less than an hour] is given little weight because the medical records and Dr. Oan-dasan\u2019s treatment notes do not support it.... [Fjindings on examination did not appear to any significant degree. Records received from Dr. Oandasan showed that on examination, there was only localized tenderness\u2019s in lower back and right hip. MRI of lumbar spine and right hip showed bulging, but no herniated, discs. In February 2011, the claimant had negative straight leg raising.<footnotemark>40</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b438-11\">We have reviewed this record evidence,<footnotemark>41</footnotemark> and agree with the district court\u2019s conclusion that \u201c[bjecause Dr. Oandasan\u2019s treatment notes do not contain any objective findings that would support his opinion as to Garcia\u2019s functional limitations \u2014 particularly no findings of muscle weakness or radiculopathy \u2014 the ALJ did not err in discounting that opinion,\u201d and adopting the opinions of Drs. Culver and Fritz.<footnotemark>42</footnotemark> Indeed, as we have repeatedly held \u201c[t]he Secretary, not the courts, has the duty to weigh the evidence, resolve material conflicts in the evidence, and decide the case.\u201d<footnotemark>43</footnotemark> The ALJ properly did so here, and did not err in crafting his functional assessment.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-12\">Finally, Garcia posits ALJ erred in relying on the vocational expert. The vocational expert, she argues, did not provide any specific definitions of the qualifications for the jobs she discussed, nor did she <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>offer a \u201cdescription of the job or the skills that were needed and did not have her reference book to find and provide information crucial to [her] case.\u201d<footnotemark>44</footnotemark> We disagree. \u201c[A]n ALJ utilizes vocational experts because of their knowledge of job requirements and working conditions.\u201d<footnotemark>45</footnotemark> So long as \u201c[t]he ALJ correctly described [the claimant\u2019s] limitation to the vocational expert,\u201d as he did here, \u201cwe should accord weight to [the expert\u2019s] testimony delineating jobs that met [the claimant\u2019s] exertional and other capabilities.\u201d<footnotemark>46</footnotemark> We have reviewed the vocational expert\u2019s testimony. It is true that on one occasion she did not provide a verbatim quotation of the formal definition of the requirements with, a job with a reasoning level of three.<footnotemark>47</footnotemark> She did paraphrase that definition, however, and read the ALJ a written description of the physical demands of the jobs that she recommended.<footnotemark>48</footnotemark> Garcia does not argue that any of the vocational expert\u2019s statements were in error, and in light of the detail provided by the expert, we cannot conclude that the ALJ reversibly erred when he relied on the expert\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-6\">We AFFIRM the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b434-14\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
