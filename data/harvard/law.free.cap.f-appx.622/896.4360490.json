The district court resentenced Ransfer, for his seven remaining convictions, to four concurrent terms of 57 months of imprisonment for conspiring to commit a robbery that affected interstate commerce and three counts of robbery, <em>id, </em>a consecutive term of 84 months for possessing a firearm in furtherance of a crime of violence, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 924(c)(1) (A) (ii), and two 300-month terms for two additional counts of possessing of a firearm, <em>id., </em>to run consecutively to one another and to Ransfer\u2019s other sentences. This sentence, Ransfer argues, is proeedurally and substantively unreasonable. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b924-17\">We review the reasonableness of a sentence under a deferential standard for abuse of discretion. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). \u201cThat familiar standard \u2018allows a range of choice for the district court, so long as that choice does not constitute a clear error of judgment.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Irey, </em>612 F.3d 1160, 1189 (11th Cir.2010) <em>(en </em>banc) (quoting <em>United States v. Frazier, </em>387 F.3d 1244, 1259 (11th Cir.2004) <em>(en banc)). </em>We will not disturb the sentence unless \u201cwe are left with the definite and firm conviction that the district court committed a clear error of judgment in weighing- the \u00a7 3553(a) factors by arriving at a sentence that lies outside the range of reasonable sentences dictated by the facts of the case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1190 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b924-18\">Ransfer\u2019s sentence is proeedurally and substantively reasonable. Ransfer argues that the district court failed to consider the statutory sentencing factors, but the court stated that its sentence reflected the \u201cseriousness of [Ransfer\u2019s] original underlying criminal conduct\u201d; Ransfer\u2019s background and history, which contained \u201cinstances of violence associated with ... criminal behavior . \\. [about which] he just never seemed to get the message\u201d that \u201cwhat he was doing was wrong\u201d; and the need for the sentence \u201cto deter further recividism.\u201d <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"897\">*897</page-number>The district court fashioned its sentence to punish Ransfer for wielding a firearm during four robberies and for pistol whipping one -victim who tried to escape, to account for Ransfer\u2019s history of violent conduct, which included choking his sister and battering his mother and hitting his pregnant girlfriend three times with a chair, and to deter Ransfer from committing similar crimes in the future. The district court reasonably determined that sentences at the low end of the advisory range for his conspiracy and robbery offenses coupled with the mandatory sentences for his firearm offenses satisfied the statutory purposes of sentencing. <em>See id. </em>Ransfer argues that the length of his sentence suggests that the district court failed to account for the need to avoid unwarranted sentencing disparities, <em>see id. </em>\u00a7 3553(a)(6), but as the district court stated, Ransfer was not similarly situated to coconspirators who \u201cadmitted ... guilt\u201d and took \u201cthe first step towards rehabilitation or remorsefulness,\u201d which affects how to \u201cfashion[ ] a sentence for a particular defendant.\u201d <em>See United States v. Cavado, </em>790 F.3d 1202, 1237 (11th Cir.2015); <em>United States v. Docampo, </em>573 F.3d 1091, 1101 (11th Cir.2009). The district court did not abuse its discretion by sentencing Ransfer to 741 months of imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-5\">We AFFIRM Ransfer\u2019s sentence.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
