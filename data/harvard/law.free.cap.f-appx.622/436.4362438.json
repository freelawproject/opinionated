He maintains that the adverse credibility determination was premised on \u201ca few minor inconsistencies\u201d which \u201cwere irrelevant to the primary issues of the case.\u201d Singh attributes these minor inconsistencies to misunderstandings and \u201csplitting of hairs\u201d by the IJ and memory deficiencies due to the attack on March 23, 2011. He further asserts that the IJ erroneously determined that he provided inconsistent statements about the political and religious conditions in India, asserting that the August 2012 Law Library of Congress Report relied upon by the IJ only evidences a mere improvement, not the elimination of, \u201cpersecution or torture of Sikhs by the Congress Party.\u201d Singh\u2019s opening brief did not include an argument in support of the denial of his application for protection under the CAT. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>Thus, Singh is deemed to have abandoned this claim. <em>See Soadjede v. Ashcroft, </em>324 F.3d 830, 833 (5th Cir.2003); <em>Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 226 (5th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b465-5\">An adverse credibility finding may be supported by <em>\u201cany </em>inconsistency or omission ... as long as the totality of the circumstances establishes that an asylum applicant is not credible.\u201d <em>Wang v. Holder, </em>569 F.3d 531, 538 (5th Cir.2009) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). This court will defer to a credibility determination \u201cunless, from the totality of the circumstances, it is plain that no reasonable fact-finder could make such an adverse credibility ruling.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 538 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b465-6\">Singh fails to demonstrate that the record as a whole compels a conclusion that he was credible. <em>See id. </em>Therefore, we will not disturb the adverse credibility determinations of the BIA and IJ. <em>See id. </em>In light of her credibility determination, the IJ concluded that Singh failed to establish that he has suffered past persecution or has a well-founded fear of persecution should he return to India. The BIA found that the adverse credibility finding, which it upheld, was sufficient to deny Singh\u2019s asylum and withholding claims because Singh failed to produce corroborating evidence. In the absence of credible testimony or other corroborating evidence from Singh, and in light of evidence in the record about the improvement of the situation between Sikhs and the Congress Party in India, Singh has not shown that the evidence compels a contrary finding. <em>See Chun v. I.N.S., </em>40 F.3d 76, 78 (5th Cir.1994) (\u201cUnder substantial evidence review, we may not reverse the BIA\u2019s factual determinations unless we find not only that the evidence supports a contrary conclusion, but that the evidence compels it.\u201d); <em>id. </em>at 79 (\u201cWithout credible evidence, the BIA had no basis upon which to grant asylum or withhold deportation.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b465-8\">Singh also challenges the IJ\u2019s evidentia-ry rulings regarding the admission of the Government\u2019s 1-213 Record of Deporta-ble/Inadmissible Alien form and the exclusion of several documents he attempted to enter into evidence in support of his request for relief from removal. Because Singh failed to properly exhaust these issues, we lack jurisdiction to consider them in the instant petition. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(d)(1); <em>Omari v. Holder, </em>562 F.3d 314, 319 (5th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b465-9\">Accordingly, Singh\u2019s the petition for review is DENIED IN PART and DISMISSED IN PART for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b464-14\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
