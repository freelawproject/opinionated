He appeals the district court\u2019s denial of his 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion for a reduction of sentence based on Amendment 782 to the United States Sentencing Guidelines, which lowered the base offense levels in the drug quantity table set forth in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(c). Or-ozco-Lopez asks this court to appoint counsel in his case.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-22\">At his original sentencing, Orozco-Lopez was assigned a base offense level of 38 under \u00a7 2Dl.l(c)(l) because his offense involved the equivalent of 324,437.32 kilograms of marijuana. Under amended \u00a7 2Dl.l(c), Orozco-Lopez\u2019s base offense level remains 38. \u00a7 2Dl.l(c)(l). In determining the effect of an amendment for purposes of \u00a7 3582(c)(2), a defendant\u2019s other applicable sentencing adjustments and criminal history remain unchanged. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(b)(l). Thus, Amendment 782 did not lower Orozco-Lopez\u2019s applicable guidelines range of 324-405 months of imprisonment, and \u00a7 3582(c)(2) does not authorize a reduction in his sentence. <em>See </em>\u00a7 lB1.10(a)(2)(B), p.s.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-23\">Orozco-Lopez complains that the district court should not have based its decision on his presentence report without giving him notice and an opportunity to challenge its reliability. He also complains that the district court denied his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>motion without considering the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3653(a) factors and gave him no opportunity to respond to its decision. He has not shown an abuse of discretion. <em>See United States v. Hernandez, </em>645 F.3d 709, 711-12 (5th Cir.2011). Nor has he shown that the district court abused its discretion by declining to appoint counsel. We will not consider Orozco-Lopez\u2019s challenges to his conviction and original sentence, which are raised for the first time on appeal and are not cognizable in a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion. <em>See United States v. Whitebird, </em>55 F.3d 1007, 1010-11 (5th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b468-4\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED. Orozco-Lopez\u2019s motion for the appointment of appellate counsel is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b467-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
