Guy challenges the constitutionality of the career-offender guideline, United States Sentencing Guidelines Manual \u00a7 4B1.1 (Nov. 2014), and the substantive reasonableness of his sentence. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-20\">Guy makes two challenges to the constitutionality of the career-offender guideline, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"898\">*898</page-number>both of which fail. .Guy argues that the career offender provisions violate his right to due process and equal protection under the Fifth Amendment, but that argument is foreclosed by <em>United States v. Brant, </em>62 F.3d 367 (11th Cir.1995), where we held that \u201c[t]he career offender scheme of using a defendant\u2019s criminal record in considering both his offense level and his criminal history under the Sentencing Guidelines bears a rational relationship to a legitimate governmental purpose \u2014 \u2018to prevent repeat offenders from continuing to victimize society.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 368 (quoting <em>United States v. Johns, </em>984 F.2d 1162, 1164 (11th Cir.1993)). Guy also argues that the \u201cimposition of a draconian mandatory sentence\u201d under the guideline constitutes cruel and unusual punishment in violation of the Eighth Amendment, but we have held that a defendant, like Guy, who is sentenced within the statutory limits cannot make the threshold showing that his sentence is grossly disproportionate to his offense, <em>see United States v. Johnson, </em>451 F.3d 1239, 1243 (11th Cir.2006). Guy was sentenced at the low end of his advisory guideline range, which was unaffected by his classification as a career offender. Guy amassed 22 criminal history points, and with a base offense level of 30 for possessing between 50 and 150 grams of methamphetamine, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(c)(5), that was increased by two levels for possessing a firearm, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(l), and another two levels for distributing a controlled substance as he entered a correctional ' facility, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(4), he had an offense level of 34 and a criminal history category of IV, which was identical to what he faced as a career offender with two prior convictions for felony offenses, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 4Bl.l(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b926-4\">Guy\u2019s sentence of 188 months of imprisonment is substantively reasonable. Guy was arrested after officers discovered in his vehicle a stolen .38 caliber revolver, a digital scale, a straw containing methamphetamine, and more than $600 dollars, and after arriving at jail, Guy transferred 121.88 grams of methamphetamine to another inmate. Guy\u2019s drug offense, as the district court stated, was his \u201cthird drug-related conviction in 2 years and his sixteenth conviction in 9 years\u201d and \u201coccurred 3 months after [he] was paroled for two prior drug-related convictions.\u201d And Guy had an extensive criminal background that included three prior convictions for possessing, selling, and manufacturing illegal drugs; six convictions that involved violent assaults and batteries of girlfriends and mistreating a six-year-old boy; and two convictions for driving under the influence. The district court reasonably determined that \u201call of the[ ] aggravating factors [were] taken into account by the guideline calculation\u201d and \u201cthat a sentence at the bottom of [Guy\u2019s] advisory guideline range\u201d of 188 to 235 months of imprisonment satisfied the statutory purposes of sentencing. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a); <em>United States v. Irey, </em>612 F.3d 1160,1190-91 (11th Cir.2010) (en banc). That Guy\u2019s sentence is within the advisory range and far less than his maximum statutory penalty of 20 years of imprisonment also suggests that his sentence is reasonable. <em>See United States v. Gonzalez, </em>550 F.3d 1319, 1324 (11th Cir.2008). The district court did not abuse its discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b926-6\">We AFFIRM Guy\u2019s sentence.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
