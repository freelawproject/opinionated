Neese, </em>200 Or App 288, 113 P3d 922 (2005), <em>rev den, </em>341 Or 449 (2006) <em>(Neese I) </em>in light of <em>State v. Ramirez, </em>343 Or 505, 173 P3d 817 (2007), <em>adh\u2019d to as modified on recons, </em>344 Or 195, 179 P3d 673 (2008), and <em>State v. Fults, </em>343 Or 515, 173 P3d 822 (2007). <em>State v. Neese, </em>345 Or 316, 195 P3d 63 (2008). In <em>Neese I </em>we vacated defendant\u2019s sentences and remanded for resentencing because the trial court had imposed a departure sentence based on a number of judicial findings of fact. That factfinding constituted plain error, and we exercised our discretion to correct it. The issue before us on remand is whether, in light of <em>Ramirez </em>and <em>Fults, </em>we properly exercised our discretion under <em>Ailes v. Portland Meadows, Inc., </em>312 Or 376, 381-82, 823 P2d 956 (1991). We conclude that our exercise of discretion in <em>Neese I </em>was erroneous. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-5\">Defendant was convicted of two counts of first-degree sodomy and one count of first-degree unlawful sexual penetration committed against his four-year-old daughter. The trial court imposed a durational departure sentence of 240 months\u2019 imprisonment on the unlawful sexual penetration conviction. The court gave the following reasons for its decision to impose a departure sentence:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b448-6\">\u201cAnd at this point I do find substantial and compelling reasons to depart from that presumptive sentence, and I\u2019m relying upon the aggravating factors as follows: That the offense resulted in permanent injury to the victim; that lengthy previous incarceration has not deterred the defendant\u2019s criminal conduct; the victim was extremely vulnerable due to her age and the absence of other family members to provide care and protection; the degree of harm or loss contributed to the current crime of conviction and was significantly greater than typical for such an offense; and that the victim suffered extreme psychological harm as evidence by the Marion County Health records; and that there was deliberate cruelty to the victim!.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b448-7\">\u201cI adopt all of these, any of one of which is sufficient to depart upward from the 130-month sentence to 240 months.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b449-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>Because the trial court stated on the record that any of the departure factors it identified was independently sufficient to support its decision to depart, we need examine only the departure factor of the victim\u2019s \u201cextreme vulnerability.\u201d On this record, we conclude that there is no legitimate debate that the jury would have found that the victim was extremely vulnerable by virtue of her youth and her relationship to defendant: the victim was defendant\u2019s four-year-old daughter, who lived alone with defendant. <em>See Ramirez, </em>343 Or at 513 (setting out \u201clegitimate debate\u201d standard for exercise of discretion to review unpreserved challenges to departure sentences based on judicial findings of fact). Accordingly, we decline to exercise our discretion to review the assigned error.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
