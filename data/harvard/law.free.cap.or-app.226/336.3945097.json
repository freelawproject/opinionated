Defendant contends that a police officer\u2019s observations of defendant\u2019s possession of marijuana in a residential backyard at 1:00 a.m., and defendant\u2019s consequent admissions and consent to search, were the products of a warrantless search that did not fall within any recognized exception to the warrant requirement. We agree and, consequently, reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-5\">The material facts are, for purposes of our review, uncontroverted. At about 1:00 a.m. on May 2, 2005, Medford Police Officer Vollrath arrived at the home of defendant\u2019s friend, Hammes, in response to a complaint about a noise disturbance. Vollrath parked his police car on the street in front of Hammes\u2019s house and, when he got out, he could hear people yelling and screaming behind the house. Vollrath believed that the crime of disorderly conduct was being committed.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-6\">A walkway ran from the sidewalk in front of Hammes\u2019s house to the front door of the house. However, Vollrath did not go to the front door. Instead, bypassing the front door, Vollrath walked up a 30-foot long driveway, along the side of Hammes\u2019s house, to a point just beyond the rear side corner of the house, where a chain link fence and gate ran between the corner of the house and the garage located at the end of the driveway. The configuration of Hammes\u2019s property is generally illustrated by the following diagram: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>Two representative photographs, among several submitted as defense exhibits, are reproduced in the appendix to this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-4\">From that vantage point, Vollrath was able to look through the fence into the backyard. Although it was dark and rainy, Vollrath was able to see into the yard because he had a flashlight and because there was a light near the top of the garage. Vollrath saw defendant and Hammes sitting on a stoop in the backyard, and he identified himself as a police officer. Vollrath then saw defendant pull marijuana plants from two cups and attempt to destroy them by submerging them in a mud puddle in Hammes\u2019s backyard.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-5\">Vollrath and Medford Police Officer Kirkpatrick, who had also arrived, then arrested defendant and advised him of his <em>Miranda </em>rights. Kirkpatrick subsequently obtained defendant\u2019s consent to search his home, where police found another marijuana plant and other evidence of marijuana cultivation. Defendant admitted that he had grown all three plants.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-6\">Defendant moved to suppress all of the evidence, arguing that it arose from an unlawful search of Hammes\u2019s backyard.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In particular, defendant contended that Vollrath\u2019s entry into the side and rear areas of the curtilage of Hammes\u2019s house effected a search for purposes of Article I, section 9, of the Oregon Constitution, and that that warrant-less search was unlawful because no exception to the warrant requirement applied.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-7\">The state offered two alternative responses. First, the state asserted that Vollrath\u2019s entry into the side and rear areas of the residential curtilage was implicitly invited and, thus, was not a \u201csearch\u201d for purposes of Article I, section 9, so that his consequent observations of defendant were \u201cplain view\u201d observations from a lawful vantage point. Second, the state asserted that, even if Vollrath\u2019s entry to that point did effect a warrantless search, that search was supported by probable cause with respect to disorderly conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>The trial court denied the motion to suppress, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b378-5\">\u201cI do believe [the officers] had probable cause to believe the crime of disorderly conduct was being committed. I think it was pretty loud, when you take into consideration the time and where they \u2014 that the officers were able to hear it, as he exited his vehicle and characterized it as yelling and screaming. And I do feel that the officer, under those circumstances. Under normal circumstances I would agree that \u2014 probably not justified in going to the rear of the house and looking in the backyard, from the rear of the driveway and looking into the backyard, but under these circumstances, I do find that it was reasonable and justified for the officers to do so. And I am not exact \u2014 it is interesting the characterization of exigent circumstances, but I don\u2019t know how to deal with that, but I am just making a finding that what they did was reasonable, and they were justified in doing it, and justified in being where they were.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b378-6\">Following the denial of suppression, defendant entered a conditional plea, pursuant to ORS 135.335(3), to possession of a controlled substance (marijuana).</p>\n<p id=\"b378-7\">On appeal, defendant essentially reiterates his position before the trial court. However, the state no longer contends that Vollrath\u2019s invasion of the side and rear areas of the residential curtilage and concomitant observations did not constitute a warrantless search for purposes of Article I, section 9. Indeed, in its brief as respondent, the state concedes that,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b378-8\">\u201cin light of the layout of the property at issue [as depicted in the photographic exhibits], and pursuant to <em>State v. Somfleth, </em>168 Or App 414, 8 P3d 221 (2000), Officer Vollrath conducted a search when he walked up the driveway of the house.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b378-9\">Rather, the state argues solely that Vollrath\u2019s warrantless invasion and observations were justified by probable cause <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>and exigent circumstances. Given the state\u2019s position on appeal and the ambiguity of the trial court\u2019s rationale for denying suppression, <em>see </em>226 Or App at 340 n 3, we begin by addressing the state\u2019s \u201cexigent circumstances\u201d contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-4\">The state contends that Vollrath had probable cause to believe that the crime of disorderly conduct was being committed in the backyard and that there was a constitutionally cognizable exigency either because Vollrath needed to terminate a continuing crime of disorderly conduct or because Vollrath believed that the noise from the backyard could indicate that people were \u201chaving a disagreement\u201d that presented the danger of someone being injured. In the latter regard, the state invokes the \u201ccommunity caretaking\u201d statute, ORS 133.033, which permits an officer to enter \u201cupon the premises of another if it reasonably appears to be necessary\u201d in order to \u201c[p]revent serious harm to any person\u201d or to \u201cMender aid to injured or ill persons[.]\u201d ORS 133.033(2)(a)(A), (B). Neither of those justifications is availing.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b379-5\">In <em>State v. Stevens, </em>311 Or 119, 126, 806 P2d 92 (1991), the court generally described the scope of the \u201cexigent circumstance\u201d exception: \u201cAn exigent circumstance is a situation that requires the police to act swiftly to prevent danger to life or serious damage to property, or to forestall a suspect\u2019s escape or the destruction of evidence.\u201d Here, as defendant asserts, the crime of disorderly conduct \u2014 based merely on people loudly \u201chaving an argument\u201d in the middle of the night \u2014 did not require \u201cthe police to act swiftly to prevent danger to life or serious damage to property, or to forestall a suspect\u2019s escape or the destruction of evidence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>To be sure, defendant\u2019s conduct may have irritated Hammes\u2019s neighbors and disturbed their sleep, but it did not rise to the level of a constitutionally cognizable \u201cexigency.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b380-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>The state\u2019s \u201cemergency aid\u201d-based argument is similarly unavailing.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In <em>State v. Follett, </em>115 Or App 672, 680, 840 P2d 1298 (1992), <em>rev den, </em>317 Or 163 (1993), we described the elements of the \u201cEmergency Aid Doctrine\u201d as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b380-4\">\u201c(1) The police must have reasonable grounds to believe that there is an emergency and an immediate need for their assistance for the protection of life.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b380-5\">\u201c(2) The emergency must be a true emergency- \u2014 -the officer\u2019s good faith belief alone is insufficient.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b380-6\">\u201c(3) The search must not be primarily motivated by an intent to arrest or to seize evidence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b380-7\">\u201c(4) The officer must reasonably suspect that the area or place to be searched is associated with the emergency and that, by making a warrantless entry, the officer will discover something that will alleviate the emergency.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b380-8\">(Footnote omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b380-9\">Again, the record here is devoid of any evidence that either of the officers responding to the noise complaint had a good faith belief \u2014 let alone reasonable grounds to believe\u2014 that the noise from the residential backyard indicated \u201can immediate need for their assistance for the protection of life.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Indeed, the testimony of both Vollrath and the other officer confirms that they were investigating the crime of disorderly conduct \u2014 and not that they were attempting to render emergency aid. <em>See generally State v. Salisbury, </em>223 Or App 516, 524-25, 196 P3d 1017 (2008) (officers heard yelling and screaming within the curtilage of an apartment consistent wdth a \u201cdomestic quarrel,\u201d but that did not indicate that violence was occurring and did not justify entry under \u201cemergency aid doctrine\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b380-10\">In sum, regardless of the existence of probable cause, Vollrath\u2019s warrantless invasion of the side and rear areas of the residential curtilage was not justified by any exigency. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>Further \u2014 and the state does not contend otherwise\u2014 Vollrath\u2019s observations, and defendant\u2019s statements and consent to search following those observations, were the unattenuated product of that predicate warrantless intrusion. <em>See generally State v. Hall, </em>339 Or 7, 115 P3d 908 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b381-4\">The dissent contends, however, that the trial court\u2019s ruling should nevertheless be affirmed on an alternative ground, <em>viz., </em>that Vollrath\u2019s warrantless invasion and consequent observations did not constitute a \u201csearch\u201d for purposes of Article I, section 9. As noted, the state has expressly abandoned, and conceded, that matter on appeal. <em>See </em>226 Or App at 340. Of course, a respondent\u2019s concession of law is not binding on us. But, here, it is revealing \u2014 and correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-5\"> A search, for purposes of Article I, section 9, occurs when \u201ca person\u2019s privacy interests are invaded.\u201d <em>State v. Owens, </em>302 Or 196, 206, 729 P2d 524 (1986). No search occurs, however, when police officers make observations from a \u201clawful vantage point.\u201d <em>State v. Ainsworth, </em>310 Or 613, 617, 801 P2d 749 (1990). A \u201clawful vantage point\u201d may be within the curtilage of a property in which a defendant has a privacy interest, given that, \u201cabsent evidence of an intent to exclude, an occupant impliedly consents to people walking to the front door and knocking on it, because of social and legal norms of behavior.\u201d <em>State v. Portrey, </em>134 Or App 460, 464, 896 P2d 7 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b381-6\">Approaches to points on the property other than a front door, however, are generally not regarded as being approaches to which the occupant has implicitly consented. <em>State v. Ohling, </em>70 Or App 249, 688 P2d 1384, <em>rev den, </em>298 Or 334 (1984), is exemplary. In <em>Ohling, </em>officers went to the front door of the defendant\u2019s home to serve a warrant to search a nearby area for evidence of marijuana cultivation. When the officers knocked, they could hear a stereo playing, but no one answered. <em>Id. </em>at 251-52. The officers then \u201cwent to the back of the house to see if they could find anyone\u201d but \u201cfound the marijuana plants instead.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 252. We reversed the defendant\u2019s consequent conviction for manufacture of a controlled substance, concluding that the officers\u2019 conduct unlawfully invaded the curtilage of the defendant\u2019s home:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b382-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>\u201cNeither the warrant nor their status as peace officers gave them any greater right to intrude onto defendant\u2019s property than any other stranger would have. Going to the front door and knocking was not a trespass. Drivers who run out of gas, Girl Scouts selling cookies, and political candidates all go to front doors of residences on a more or less regular basis. Doing so is so common in this society that, unless there are posted warnings, a fence, a moat filled with crocodiles, or other evidence of a desire to exclude casual visitors, the person living in the house has impliedly consented to the intrusion. <em>Going to the back of the house is a different matter. Such an action is both less common and less acceptable in our society. There is no implied consent for a stranger to do so. </em>\u2018[W]e do not place things of a private nature on our front porches that we may very well entrust to the seclusion of a backyard, patio or deck.\u2019 The facts of this case do not show either an express or an implied consent for strangers to go to the back of defendant\u2019s house.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b382-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 253 (citations omitted; emphasis added; brackets in Ohling); <em>see also State v. Glines, </em>134 Or App 21, 23-25, 894 P2d 516, <em>rev den, </em>321 Or 512 (1995) (concluding that police had not unlawfully invaded curtilage where the officers went to the defendant\u2019s home but, instead of going to the front door, went to a side entry that was visible from the public sidewalk, had a doorbell, and was adjacent to a common driveway that the defendant shared with his next-door neighbor).</p>\n<p id=\"b382-5\">In <em>State v. Somfleth, </em>168 Or App 414, 424-25, 8 P3d 221 (2000), after reviewing <em>Ohling </em>and <em>Glines </em>at length, we reiterated and amplified the controlling inquiry:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b382-6\">\u201cOur cases have treated location as, in effect, giving rise to rebuttable \u2018presumptions.\u2019 The fundamental principle, as emphasized in <em>Ohling, </em>is that intrusions onto residential curtilage are deemed to be trespasses unless the entry is \u2018privileged or [has] defendant\u2019s express or implied consent.\u2019 70 Or App at 252. Nevertheless, given prevailing social norms, the homeowner is presumed to have implicitly consented to entry into the front yard to approach the front door. <em>Conversely, also given prevailing norms, such a presumption of implied consent to enter is not ascribed to other areas of the curtilage. See Ohling, </em>70 Or App at 253 (\u2018Going to the back of the house is a different matter.\u2019). <em>Rather, entry onto those areas is presumptively a trespass. Id.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b383-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>\u201cNevertheless, that presumptive treatment is not necessarily conclusive: A homeowner can abrogate the presumption of implied consent to approach the front door by undertaking sufficient steps to exclude casual visitors from the front yard. <em>See Ohling, </em>70 Or App at 253. <em>Conversely, the presumption that other invasions of the curtilage are trespasses can be overcome by evidence that the homeowner has sufficiently implicitly or explicitly invited entry. </em>Thus, in <em>Glines, </em>the doorbell on the side entrance, coupled with the facts that that entrance was visible from the public sidewalk and was directly accessible from the common driveway, so strongly evinced an invitation to the public to use that entry \u2014 and the defendant\u2019s concomitant expectation that that entrance would be so used \u2014 that the officers\u2019 entry was not a trespass.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b383-4\">\n<em>\u201cApplying that analysis here, the issue reduces to whether the state overcame the presumption that the officers\u2019 entry through the open back gate was a trespass. In particular, did other circumstances so evince implied consent to enter the backyard as to overcome that adverse presumption?\u201d</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b383-5\">(Emphasis added; brackets in <em>Somfleth.) </em>The state, as proponent of the evidence, has the burden of proving an implicit invitation to public entry sufficient to overcome the presumption of trespass.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-6\">The dissent at least implicitly acknowledges that construct, <em>see </em>226 Or App at 352-53 (Wollheim, J., dissenting), and concludes that the combination of two circumstances (although neither alone would be sufficient) evinced the requisite \u201cimplied invitation\u201d here. First, \u201cthe driveway provided an unobstructed pathway to the rear of the house.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 357 (Wollheim, J., dissenting). Second, defendant and Hammes were making unreasonable noise, engaging in disorderly conduct, in the backyard of the house at 1:00 a.m. <em>Id. </em>at 356-57 (Wollheim, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b383-7\">With respect to the \u201clayout\u201d of the property, it is undisputed that, to reach the point from which he made his observations, Vollrath had to walk up the driveway (which was not a shared driveway, as in <em>Glines), </em>bypassing the front door of the residence and traversing the entire width or side of the house to reach the gate between the side of the house <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>and the standalone garage from which he made his observations. Further, from the photo exhibits in this record, there is no reason to believe that, given its juxtaposition between the house and the garage, the gate was visible from the street\u2014 much less inviting entry to that point \u2014 at 1:00 a.m. on a rainy night. Certainly, there was no structural feature akin to the doorbell on the side entrance in <em>Glines, see </em>134 Or App at 23-25, that manifested such an intent. Finally, it is undisputed that, at the time of Vollrath\u2019s entry, a car was parked in front of the garage at the end of the driveway\u2014 further contradicting any implication of an \u201cinvitation\u201d to enter to that point.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-4\">Thus, the purported invitation to enter depends on the proposition that the homeowner, Hammes, by engaging in disorderly conduct in his backyard \u2014 or, presumably, by permitting defendant to engage in such conduct \u2014 implicitly invited the police to enter. In that regard, the dissent posits that it would not \u201coffend social norms of behavior\u201d in such circumstances for a member of the public to walk up the driveway alongside the home to ask defendant to quiet down and, thus, that defendant manifested, through his conduct, an implied invitation of public entry. 226 Or App at 357-58 (Wollheim, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b384-5\">With respect, the upshot of the dissent\u2019s analysis is that, if a person engages in sufficiently \u201cpublicly\u201d obnoxious behavior within the residential curtilage \u2014 at any time of the day or night \u2014 -that conduct effectively waives constitutional protections against warrantless trespassory invasions. The urban homeowner, sitting on the patio, listening to a ball game with the volume turned up so loud as to disturb his neighbors\u2019 Sunday afternoon peace, the suburban homeowner doing work in her backyard with exceedingly and irritatingly noisy power tools, the kids in the would-be band \u201cpracticing\u201d in the backyard at 8:00 p.m. on a summer Saturday evening \u2014 all (in the dissent\u2019s view) have invited entry by strangers, including warrantless entry by police officers.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-6\">Such an approach, unsupported by Oregon precedent, would qualitatively subvert bedrock constitutional principles that rigorously protect the residential curtilage <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>from warrantless, uninvited intrusions. <em>See generally State v. Dixson/Digby, </em>87 Or App 1, 6-7, 740 P2d 1224 (1987), <em>rev\u2019d on other grounds, </em>307 Or 195, 766 P2d 1015 (1988) (addressing constitutional underpinnings of protection of curtilage in context of addressing \u201copen fields\u201d doctrine).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>See also Payton v. New York, </em>445 US 573, 601, 100 S Ct 1371, 63 L Ed 2d 639 (1980) (emphasizing, for purposes of Fourth Amendment analysis, \u201cthe overriding respect for the sanctity of the home that has been embedded in our traditions since the origins of the Republic\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b385-4\">At base, the dissent misapprehends the meaning and function of implied \u201cinvitation\u201d as a qualification of those fundamental constitutional protections. As consistently employed in our case law, \u201cinvitation\u201d connotes a manifestation, either by custom or conduct, of the property owner\u2019s anticipatory <em>consent </em>to entry by members of the public to that point of the curtilage. <em>See, e.g., Somfleth, </em>168 Or App at 425 (framing dispositive issue: \u201c[D]id other circumstances so evince implied consent to enter the backyard as to overcome [the] presumption\u201d that invasion of the backyard is a trespass?); <em>Ohling, </em>70 Or App at 252 (officers\u2019 entry \u201cwas a trespass unless it was privileged or had [the] defendant\u2019s express or implied consent\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b385-5\">Thus, \u201cinvitation\u201d is a function of consent: Would a member of the public reasonably understand, in the totality of the circumstances, that the property owner has consented, by custom or conduct, to the entry onto the curtilage to that point? Or, more particularly here, would a member of the public reasonably understand that the property owner has so <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>manifested such consent as to overcome the presumption that entry into the \u201cnonfront\u201d areas of the curtilage is a trespass?</p>\n<p id=\"b386-4\">The dissent erroneously conflates consent \u2014 the constitutional prerequisite to entry \u2014 with notions of reasonable foreseeability.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> If a homeowner is playing music (or listening to a ball game, or using power tools, or yelling) too loudly in the backyard, it may be reasonably foreseeable that irate neighbors may enter to confront the homeowner. But the homeowner has not, even implicitly, manifested consent to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>that entry. Indeed, quite the opposite: The irate neighbors may want to enter, but the homeowner does not want them\u2014 or any other stranger \u2014 there.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-4\">The dissent maintains, nevertheless, that the entry was \u201cinvited\u201d by reference to \u201csocial and legal norms of behavior.\u201d Except in rare instances of communal behavior so common and well established as to be akin to <em>custom </em>\u2014 e.g., that a property owner has, in the absence of manifestations of exclusion, presumptively consented to strangers going to the front door \u2014 -judicial reference to such \u201cnorms\u201d is illusory. Are they judicially noticeable? Or do we \u201cknow them when we see them\u201d? In all events, even if social and legal norms can be reliably identified, they are not conclusive of the protections afforded under Article I, section 9. <em>See State v.

Rather, many, perhaps most, Oregonians might (a) telephone the neighbor; or (b) go to the neighbor\u2019s front door and, failing a response, go home; or (c) call the police, who would go to the neighbor\u2019s front door, knock loudly, and, failing a response, would either abandon their efforts or obtain a warrant or stop by for a chat with the neighbor the next day. <em>Cf.

With respect, that reference in both cases is inapposite to this circumstance.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-6\">Neither <em>Wacker </em>nor <em>Louis </em>involved any physical invasion of the residential curtilage. Rather, <em>Wacker </em>involved the admissibility of observations of conduct within a car, and <em>Louis </em>addressed whether evidence obtained without a warrant from a vantage point <em>outside the residential curtilage </em>should be suppressed. <em>See Wacker, </em>317 Or at 421 (officers, while stationed on second floor of a tavern, used a \u201cstarlight scope\u201d to observe drug-related activity in a parked car in tavern\u2019s parking lot late at night); <em>Louis, </em>296 Or at 59 (officer, while located in the defendant\u2019s neighbor\u2019s garage, took photographs, using a telephoto lens, of the defendant exposing himself in the living room of his residence).</p>\n<p id=\"b386-7\">Further, with respect to <em>Louis\u2019s </em>\u201cnoise ordinance\u201d reference, the dissent\u2019s emphasized invocation of that language does not acknowledge its proper context:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b386-8\">\u201cNevertheless, not everything that police officers see or hear one do in private quarters requires a search warrant. The question is when observation (or listening) becomes a \u2018search\u2019 within the legal meaning of that term.

One would not, for instance, expect police to obtain a search warrant to charge violation of a noise ordinance against sounds emanating from private premises. An indecent exposure in a window opening to public view is not very different. This, we think, is all that can properly be meant by the phrase that a person\u2019s conduct within private premises may be such as to sacrifice the \u2018expectation of privacy.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b386-9\"><em>Louis, </em>296 Or at 61. Thus, in <em>Louis, </em>the \u201csound ordinance\u201d hypothetical refers to the admissibility of evidence of a crime that was within the public\u2019s perception from outside the residential curtilage. Nothing in <em>Louis </em>\u2014 or <em>Wacker </em>\u2014 suggests that, based on such publicly perceptible information, the police can, in the absence of a legally sufficient exigency, invade the curtilage without a warrant to further investigate or to effect an arrest. Indeed, the implication of the dissent\u2019s reasoning in this case is that the police, without a warrant, could simply have entered Mr. Louis\u2019s home to arrest him because his criminal conduct, albeit within the residential curtilage, was publicly perceptible.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b387-7\"> In this case, of course, Vollrath did not even first attempt to knock on the front door.

And, when I call the police for assistance, the police are also legally limited to only approaching my neighbors\u2019 front door. Without a warrant, the police may not venture any further. So the police tell me that they have to leave and I have to tough it out that night because the police cannot walk down the driveway where my neighbors are making unreasonable noise at 1:00 a.m. The majority claims that to decide otherwise would \u201csubvert bedrock constitutional principles.\u201d 226 Or App at 346. With respect, I disagree and therefore dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-8\">Article I, section 9, of the Oregon Constitution protects an individual\u2019s privacy interests against unreasonable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>searches and seizures.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> A search occurs only where the \u201cpolice invade a protected privacy interest.\u201d <em>State v. Wacker, </em>317 Or 419, 426, 856 P2d 1029 (1993). The relevant privacy interest under Article I, section 9, is \u201can interest in freedom from particular forms of scrutiny.\u201d <em>State v.

Similarly, a \u201csearch\u201d under Article I, section 9, does not extend to the unaided observations by a police officer from a lawful vantage point because \u201cthere is no <em>generally recognized freedom </em>from such scrutiny by private individuals.\u201d <em>State v.

The Supreme Court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b390-4\">\u201c \u2018[N]ot everything that police officers see or hear one do in private quarters requires a search warrant. * * * Persons may conduct themselves in otherwise protected areas in such a way that their words or acts can plainly be seen or heard outside without any special effort. <em>One would not, for instance, expect police to obtain a search warrant to charge violation of a noise ordinance against sounds emanating from private premises\u2019 \u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b390-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 425-26 (quoting <em>State v. Louis, </em>296 Or 57, 61, 672 P2d 708 (1983)) (emphasis added). Unless a police officer may lawfully enter the curtilage, however, a police officer would frequently be unable to determine whom to charge with such a noise violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-6\">Consistently with that proposition, this court has concluded that police intrusion onto private land significantly impairs an individual\u2019s interest in freedom from scrutiny if \u201ca private individual would offend <em>social and legal norms of behavior </em>by engaging in the same kind of intrusion.\u201d <em>State v. Portrey, </em>134 Or App 460, 464, 896 P2d 7 (1995) (emphasis added). Here, as explained below, where there was probable cause to believe that defendant was engaged in disorderly conduct, the officer\u2019s entry onto the unobstructed driveway did not so offend those social and legal norms of behavior. Accordingly, I would conclude that the officer\u2019s entry onto the driveway was lawful because it did not significantly impair defendant\u2019s constitutional privacy interests.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-7\">An officer\u2019s intrusion onto the curtilage area surrounding a house significantly impairs a person\u2019s constitutional privacy interests only if a resident has not expressly or impliedly consented to that intrusion.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>State v.

Whether social norms of behavior would be offended by such an intrusion informs our analysis of whether a resident has impliedly consented to that intrusion. This court has established a <em>rebuttable </em>presumption that \u201can occupant impliedly consents to people walking to the front door and knocking on it, <em>because of social and legal norms of behavior\u201d Portrey, </em>134 Or App at 464 (emphasis added); <em>see also State v.

Premsingh, </em>154 Or App 682, 689, 962 P2d 732 (1998) (internal quotation marks omitted); <em>see also Portrey, </em>134 Or App at 465 (the scope of the presumptive implied consent does not permit a visitor to pick up boots on the front porch for inspection); <em>State v. Gabbard, </em>129 Or App 122, 128, 877 P2d 1217, <em>rev den, </em>320 Or 131 (1994) (\u201cAn officer\u2019s right to go to the front door of a house is based on implied consent to allow visitors to take reasonable steps to make contact with the occupant.\u201d). The motivation for making contact is not relevant; accordingly, a police officer may also seek to make contact with a resident even when motivated by criminal investigatory aims. <em>State v. McIntyre/Pereira, </em>123 Or App 436, 442, 860 P2d 299 (1993), <em>rev den, </em>318 Or 351 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b391-5\">The purpose to make contact with a resident is central to whether a presumption regarding implied consent is rebutted. For example, the public presumptively may enter privately owned lands beyond the curtilage area surrounding a home. <em>Dixson/Digby, </em>307 Or at 211. By posting a \u201cno hunting\u201d sign, a property owner rebuts that presumption as to members of the public having the purpose of hunting there <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>but does not rebut that presumption as to members of the public having the purpose to camp or hike there. <em>Id. </em>at 212.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-4\">Similarly, this court has determined that \u201cno trespassing\u201d signs may be \u201cinadequate to exclude visitors who would use the driveway to make contact with the occupants of the house.\u201d <em>Gabbard, </em>129 Or App at 128. We reasoned that a <em>\u201creasonable visitor </em>could have assumed that [a no \u2018trespassing<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>] sign was intended only to exclude those who might put the property to their own uses * * * [but not] to visitors who desired to contact the residents.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b392-5\">Despite the presumption favoring front-door access, \u201clocation (\u2018front yard\u2019 vs. \u2018side yard\u2019 vs. \u2018backyard\u2019) is [only] one of a universe of circumstances to be considered in assessing whether a resident has implicitly consented to an invasion of the curtilage.\u201d <em>Somfleth, </em>168 Or App at 424. Where the universe of circumstances are objectively viewed as \u201cmanifesting [a resident\u2019s] expectation that casual visitors\u201d would enter upon the portion of the curtilage away from the front door to contact a resident, the presumption of nonconsent is overcome. <em>Id. </em>at 427.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-6\">In accordance with that standard, this court concluded that a resident had impliedly consented to entries upon residential curtilage to approach a side door where the side door was adjacent to a driveway shared with a neighbor and was equipped with a doorbell visible from the street. <em>Id. </em>at 426-27 (discussing <em>State v. Glines, </em>134 Or App 21, 894 P2d 516, <em>rev den, </em>321 Or 512 (1995)). Likewise, where a resident walks toward officers and those officers respond by walking toward the resident but away from the front door of a house, the officers\u2019 \u201cdecision to go toward [the resident], rather than to the front door, [i]s reasonable.\u201d <em>Gabbard, </em>129 Or App at 128-29. Consequently, where a resident manifests by displaying indicia such as doorbells or by conduct that a reasonable visitor may contact the resident on portions of the curtilage away from the front door, the resident impliedly consents to that contact.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-7\">Nonetheless, the presumption of nonconsent to access the curtilage away from the front door of a home is not overcome simply because that portion of the curtilage is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>visible and accessible to the public.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> A resident must <em>manifest </em>an expectation to being contacted there. A resident is not \u201cobligated to undertake affirmative measures to preclude entry,\u201d such as a privacy fence or locked gate, in order to safeguard a privacy interest to one\u2019s backyard or the side of one\u2019s home. <em>Somfleth, </em>168 Or App at 426. Similarly, a resident cannot manifest an expectation of being contacted in the backyard where no evidence indicates that the resident is likely to be present there. <em>See, e.g., State v. Jackson, </em>71 Or App 76, 79, 691 P2d 130 (1984) (no implied consent to look in the backyard where no evidence \u201cgave the deputies reason to think defendant might be behind the house\u201d); <em>Ohling, </em>70 Or App at 253 (no implied consent to continue looking for a resident in the backyard after knocking on the door proved unproductive<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>); <em>State v. Russo, </em>68 Or App 760, 683 P2d 163 (1984) (no implied consent where a noise disturbance was created by barking dogs).</p>\n<p id=\"b393-4\">However, individuals may \u201csacrifice[ ] any right of privacy by conducting themselves in such a way that their activities could be seen without any special effort.\u201d <em>State v. Rodriguez-Ganegar, </em>186 Or App 530, 538, 63 P3d 1225, <em>rev den, </em>335 Or 578 (2003). Accordingly, although an officer typically does not have any right to peer through a crack in an otherwise obstructed window, <em>State v. Fortmeyer/Palmer, </em>178 Or App 485, 491, 37 P3d 223 (2001), when an individual draws the attention of the public by making loud noises late at night, an officer\u2019s observations through cracks in the window blinds may be lawful, <em>Rodriguez-Ganegar, </em>186 Or App at 537-38; <em>see also State v. Castillo-Salgado, </em>186 Or App 605, 610-11, 64 P3d 1169, <em>rev den, </em>336 Or 60 (2003) (an officer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>looking through a gap in the blinds when his attention was drawn by movements inside an apartment did not offend social norms).</p>\n<p id=\"b394-4\">In sum, where the evidence establishes that a resident\u2019s conduct manifests an objective expectation that members of the general public may intrude on the residential curtilage to contact a resident there, the resident has impliedly consented to such intrusions. Because such an intrusion by a private individual is lawful \u2014 and does not constitute trespass \u2014 an officer so intruding is also acting lawfully. Because any unaided observations by a police officer from a lawful vantage point does not diminish an individual\u2019s interest in freedom from scrutiny, an officer\u2019s observations under those circumstances do not constitute a search under Article I, section 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-5\">Here, the trial court concluded that, <em>under normal circumstances, </em>the location of the house and the placement of the driveway would not manifest an implied invitation for the officer to enter onto the driveway and walk down it to look into the backyard. However, defendant engaged in unreasonably loud and disruptive behaviors in the backyard of his friend\u2019s Medford home at 1:00 a.m., creating noises loud enough for the officers to have heard the noises from the street in front of the house. Specifically, the trial court found that those behaviors were sufficient to establish probable cause to believe that people were engaged in disorderly conduct. Accordingly, the trial court stated, \u201cunder <em>these circumstances, </em>I do find that it was reasonable and justified for the officers\u201d to so enter the curtilage. (Emphasis added.) The trial court was correct.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b394-6\">By itself, the accessibility of the rear portion of the driveway did not establish an implied invitation for members of the public to so enter the curtilage. But location is only \u201cone of a universe of circumstances to be considered.\u201d <em>Somfleth, </em>168 Or App at 424.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>Defendant\u2019s conduct \u2014 engaging in disorderly conduct \u2014 created a specific context in which it would have been socially acceptable for a private individual to walk down the driveway alongside the house to ask defendant to quiet down. A person commits the crime of disorderly conduct if a person \u201c[mjakes unreasonable noise\u201d and has the intent to cause, or recklessly creates the risk of causing, \u201cpublic inconvenience, annoyance or alarm.\u201d ORS 166.025(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b395-4\">The majority denigrates the significance, and misinterprets the statutory meaning, of defendant\u2019s disorderly conduct by equating it to mere \u201c \u2018publicly5 obnoxious behavior.\u201d 226 Or App at 346. If the offense of disorderly conduct criminalized mere publicly obnoxious behavior, this court would likely find such a statute to be constitutionally defective \u201cbecause a significant amount of unreasonably obscene, unreasonably insulting, unreasonably shocking, unreasonably offensive, and unreasonably insensitive expression * * * is constitutionally protected.\u201d <em>State v. Rich, </em>218 Or App 642, 650, 180 P3d 744 (2008). However, the disorderly conduct statute, ORS 166.025, is not similarly defective. Rather, as this court held, ORS 166.025 is constitutionally permissible as a \u201cclassic time, place, or manner law\u201d that restrains conduct based on its \u201cvolume, duration, location, and the like\u201d without stifling expression. <em>Rich, </em>218 Or App at 647, 650.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-5\">Defendant\u2019s conduct invited entry not because defendant was publicly obnoxious but because the volume, duration, place, and time of defendant\u2019s conduct established probable cause that he created a risk of public inconvenience, annoyance, or alarm. By engaging in disorderly conduct, defendant sacrificed the presumption that intrusions on the curtilage at the rear of the house are generally intrusions upon a resident\u2019s liberty interests. He sacrificed that presumption because, under those circumstances, members of the public would not offend social norms of behavior by entering the residential curtilage to ask defendant to bring his conduct in compliance with the law. By manifesting that a reasonable visitor would seek to contact defendant there, defendant impliedly consented to that entry. Accordingly, members of the public so acting would <em>not </em>be committing criminal trespass. Where the driveway provided an unobstructed pathway to the rear of the house, the layout of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>property did nothing to contradict any implied invitation for a member of the public to contact defendant there.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Thus, the officer\u2019s entry was neither an unlawful trespass nor a significant impairment of defendant\u2019s rights under Article I, section 9, of the Oregon Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-4\">As noted above, the Supreme Court would not \u201c \u2018expect police to obtain a search warrant to charge violation of a noise ordinance against sounds emanating from private premises.\u2019 \u201d <em>Wacker, </em>317 Or at 426 (quoting <em>Louis, </em>296 Or at 61). The majority\u2019s holding and reasoning would have the opposite practical effect, because under its interpretation of implied consent, a police officer would no longer be able to enter onto the curtilage to identify any particular defendant to charge. The principle of implied consent has never before been treated so narrowly.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-5\">The majority substantially narrows the construct of \u201cimplied consent\u201d by declaring that invitation must convey \u201cthe property owner\u2019s anticipatory <em>consent </em>to entry by members of the public.\u201d 226 Or App at 347 (emphasis in original). Claiming that \u201c \u2018invitation\u2019 is a function of consent,\u201d the majority argues that implied consent cannot be found where \u201cthe homeowner does not <em>want </em>them \u2014 or any other stranger \u2014 there.\u201d 226 Or App at 348-49 (emphasis added). Although the majority claims that this definition of implied consent has been \u201cconsistently employed in our case law,\u201d 226 Or App at 347, I am unable to discern that definition from the cases cited by the majority.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-6\">The majority\u2019s proposed definition interjects for the first time a resident\u2019s <em>subjective desire </em>\u2014 whether the resident <em>wants </em>someone to enter \u2014 as an element of implied consent. This court has never before recognized such a subjective <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>element. <em>McIntyre/Pereira, </em>123 Or App at 444 (Riggs, J., dissenting) (\u201cSubjective intent plays no role in the <em>Ohling </em>analysis\u201d regarding implied consent); <em>id. </em>at 441 n 2 (majority opinion) (\u201cThe dissent claims that we endorse a subjective analysis. * * * Nothing in our opinion supports the dissent\u2019s claims.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b397-4\">Rather, this court has consistently treated that subjective component \u2014 akin to whether a person may not <em>want </em>magazine salespeople, political canvassers, or even Girls Scouts selling cookies to approach the front doors of their homes during dinnertime \u2014 as irrelevant to our analysis of implied consent. <em>See Ohling, </em>70 Or App at 253 (describing similar contacts to which residents are presumed to have impliedly consented). Similarly, most residents do not want and would not have <em>explicitly </em>invited police officers to approach their front doors to serve arrest warrants on them. But those subjective desires play no role in determinations of <em>implied </em>consent. <em>See also Wacker, </em>317 Or at 425 (\u201cThe privacy interests protected from unreasonable searches under Article I, section 9, are defined by <em>an objective test </em>of whether the government\u2019s conduct would significantly impair an individual\u2019s interest in freedom from scrutiny.\u201d). (Internal quotation marks omitted; emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b397-5\">In addition, the majority erroneously narrows the definition of implied consent by rejecting most judicial references to social and legal norms. 226 Or App at 349-50. The majority claims that such references are \u201cillusory,\u201d \u201c[ejxcept in rare instances of communal behavior so common and well established as to be akin to custom.\u201d 226 Or App at 349. The majority proceeds to advise that unless the social acceptability of police intrusions are beyond \u201creasonable dispute\u201d \u2014 that is, adopted by social \u201cconsensus\u201d \u2014 those intrusions should not evince an implied consent to entry. 226 Or App at 350.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-6\">The majority makes those claims without legal citation. No Oregon case indicates that the notion of social <em>consensus </em>has ever even been considered \u2014 much less adopted\u2014 as the standard for ascertaining either the scope of implied consent, in particular, or the reach of Article I, section 9, in general. Within the context of implied consent, for example, the dissent in <em>McIntyre /Pereira </em>would have interpreted a tall <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>wooden fence and a closed metal gate around the curtilage of a home as contradicting any implied consent to enter. 123 Or App at 444 (Riggs, J., dissenting). However, although the dissent\u2019s view in that case illustrated a disagreement regarding social norms, the majority remanded the case to the trial court to determine whether, in the totality of the circumstances, the officers nonetheless had implied invitation for their entry. <em>Id. </em>at 442. Similarly, no case has analyzed whether <em>any </em>member of society would have interpreted a \u201cno hunting\u201d or \u201cno trespassing\u201d sign as a lack of social consensus to enter the curtilage to contact a resident; instead, those cases turn on whether such signs provide the public with \u201cobjectively reasonable notice\u201d that their entry was not allowed. <em>State v. Hitesman/Page, </em>113 Or App 356, 361, 833 P2d 306, <em>rev den, </em>314 Or 574 (1992). No social consensus requirement for a determination of social and legal norms has been incorporated into our existing case law, and no such requirement should be adopted.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-4\">I agree with the majority\u2019s contention that notions of implied consent should not depend on defining prevailing norms \u201cby a majority vote of this court en banc.\u201d 226 Or App at 349. The question is not what a majority of the people \u2014 or a majority of judges on this court \u2014 believe is socially acceptable. The question is what a <em>reasonable visitor </em>would have understood. That is the fundamental principle upon which the presumption that a resident impliedly consents to front door access is based. That is the fundamental principle that the legal precedent of this state has consistently abided by. And that is the fundamental principle that the majority departs from in its ruling in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-5\">Article I, section 9, protects individual interests from unreasonable scrutiny. The Oregon Supreme Court interprets that interest by reference to social and legal norms of behavior. Governmental intrusions on curtilage to approach the front door of residential homes are permissible because social norms provide that private individuals may take reasonable steps to make contact with residents there. Similarly, when a resident manifests an expectation that private individuals may seek contact on portions of the residential curtilage away from the front door, and such contact would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>not offend social and legal norms of behavior, a private individual may do so without violating the law. Under the facts of this case, where defendant engaged in disorderly conduct\u2014 by making unreasonable noise that caused public inconvenience, annoyance, or alarm at 1:00 a.m. \u2014 it would have been socially acceptable, and legal, for a member of the public to walk down the driveway to ask defendant to quiet down. Because a member of the public could walk down the driveway without engaging in criminal behavior, a police officer so intruding does not violate defendant\u2019s Article I, section 9, rights. Consequently, the trial court did not err by denying defendant\u2019s motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-4\">For those reasons, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<judges id=\"b399-5\">Edmonds, Ortega, and Sercombe, JJ., join in this dissent.</judges>\n<p id=\"b400-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>Appendix</p>\n<p id=\"b400-4\">[[Image here]]</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b388-9\"> ORS 164.245(1) provides that \u201c[a] person commits the crime of criminal trespass in the second degree if the person enters or remains unlawfully * * * in or upon premises.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b389-5\"> Article I, section 9, provides, in part, that \u201c[n]o law shall violate the right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable search, or seizure!.]\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b389-6\"> The majority claims that \u201csocial and legal norms * * * are not conclusive of the protections afforded under Article I, section 9.\u201d 226 Or App at 349. For support, the majority relies on <em>Campbell </em>for the proposition that \u201c[s]ocial and legal norms cannot govern the scope of the constitutional provision.\u201d 306 Or at 171. I read <em>Campbell </em>differently. The passage cited by the majority is included in a paragraph discussing the scope of a search under Article I, section 9, when the government uses radio transmitters and other new technologies that could not have been foreseen when Article I, section 9, was adopted in 1859. <em>Id. </em>For governmental use of those new technologies, the Supreme Court announced that the applicable legal test is \u201cwhether the practice, if engaged in wholly at the discretion of the government, will significantly impair \u2018the people\u2019s\u2019 freedom from scrutiny.\u201d <em>Id. </em>As noted, the Supreme Court also stated, as a general rule unrelated to the government\u2019s use of new technologies, \u201cfreedom from scrutiny is determined by social and legal norms of behavior.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 170. Because this case involves <em>trespass </em>laws and not the governmental use of new technologies, the majority\u2019s reliance on <em>Campbell </em>is misplaced.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-7\">Furthermore, I do not claim that, within the present context, social and legal norms of behavior would he conclusively determinative of Article I, section 9, rights. My view is that social and legal norms determine the bounds of <em>implied </em>consent. Implied consent, in turn, sets a default rule that may be overcome by the <em>explicit </em>renunciation of any implied consent.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b390-8\"><em> </em>Defendant was a guest, and not a resident, at the home. A guest may generally assert the constitutional privacy interests held by the host, although the guest\u2019s privacy interests are not as extensive as the privacy interests of the host. <em>State v.

In fact, my analysis recognizes that most reasonably foreseeable intrusions upon residential curtilage lack implied consent. It is for that reason that the concept of \u201creasonable foreseeability\u201d has not been incorporated into this court\u2019s relevant case law. However, because implied consent is predicated upon social norms, every implied invitation must necessarily be reasonably foreseeable. In other words, implied invitation is a small subset of what may be reasonably foreseeable.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b393-6\"> The majority observes that, in Ohling, \u201c[wjhen the officers knocked, they could hear a stereo playing.\u201d 226 Or App at 343. The dissent in <em>Ohling </em>suggests that the stereo was playing inside the home. 70 Or App at 254 (Van Hoomissen, J., dissenting). No other evidence indicated that anyone was present in the backyard.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b394-7\"> The majority states that it is \u201cunclear from the trial court\u2019s remarks whether the court denied suppression based on the state\u2019s probable cause rationale, the \u2018no search/\u201cplain view\u201d \u2019 rationale, or both.\u201d 226 Or App at 340 n 3. Regardless of any ambiguity in the trial court\u2019s remarks, the trial court was correct in reaching its ultimate conclusion that the officer\u2019s intrusion onto the curtilage was lawful.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b396-7\"> The majority states that a car parked on the driveway contradicts any implication of an invitation to enter to that point. 226 Or App at 346. This court has never before held that a car parked in the driveway, as this car was parked, may negate an implied invitation to intrude. A parked car is not an obstruction that signals an expectation that no one may walk beyond that point. At best, a parked car may indicate that a resident is more likely to be home. Under the circumstances of this case, I do not understand why the court should treat the parked car as a contradiction of any implied invitation to enter. Perhaps if the car was parked in a manner that precluded anyone from walking down the driveway to the end of the house and to the chainlink fence, it would be reasonable to find that the car negated any implied invitation. But that is not this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
