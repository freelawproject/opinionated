J.</author>\n<p id=\"b358-3\">In this land use case, Umpqua Pacific Resources Company, Inc. (Umpqua) applied to Douglas County to build a nonfarm dwelling on a three-acre parcel of land located in a zone designated for exclusive farm use (EFU). The county approved the application. Wetherell, a neighbor, appealed the approval to the Land Use Board of Appeals (LUBA), which three times remanded the case to the county. Umpqua now seeks judicial review of the most recent remand. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-4\">At the core of the dispute is the statutory standard for approval of nonfarm dwellings on EFU land. Set out in ORS 215.284(2)(b), that standard is that the \u201cdwellings\u201d must be located on \u201cgenerally unsuitable land for the production of farm crops and livestock or merchantable tree species.\u201d In this case, one of the principal issues has been precisely what is included as an aspect of a \u201cdwelling\u201d that may be located on such unsuitable land and, specifically, whether that term includes essential or accessory improvements and structures like driveways, wells, septic systems, and drain-fields.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-5\">In its initial decision to approve Umpqua\u2019s application, the county found that a .3-acre portion of Umpqua\u2019s land satisfied the statutory standard (that is to say, the .3-acre portion is unsuitable, while the balance of the three acres remains suitable for farm use). The county further determined that only the dwelling itself needed to be located on that portion of property, permitting Umpqua to construct essential or accessory improvements to the dwelling such as driveways, wells, septic systems, and drainfields on the remaining property that remains suitable for farm use.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-6\">Wetherell appealed to LUBA, arguing that the county\u2019s suitability findings were not supported by substantial evidence. She also argued that improvements such as driveways, wells, septic systems, and drainfields for the non-farm dwelling could not be located on the part of the property that <em>is </em>suitable for farm use. LUBA agreed with Wetherell that the county\u2019s findings that the .3-acre portion of the parcel is generally unsuitable were not supported by substantial evidence. <em>Wetherell v. Douglas County, </em>51 Or LUBA 699, 714 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>(2006) <em>(Wetherell I). </em>LUBA further agreed that improvements for the nonfarm dwelling could not be located on the part of the parcel that is suitable. <em>Id. </em>at 716. LUBA instructed the county to explain on remand \u201chow the identified improvements will be located on the generally unsuitable portion.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b359-4\">On Umpqua\u2019s petition, we affirmed. <em>Wetherell v. Douglas County, </em>209 Or App 1, 146 P3d 343 (2006). We concluded that LUBA correctly applied the substantial evidence standard, but determined that it was not necessary to address whether LUBA correctly interpreted the statute in requiring that, in addition to the dwelling, accessory improvements also must be located on the portion of the parcel that is generally unsuitable for farm use. <em>Id. </em>at 5-6.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-5\">On remand, the county took additional evidence and once again found that the .3-acre portion of the property is generally unsuitable for farm use. The county also again did not require that the accessory improvements be constructed on that portion of the parcel; rather, the county continued to permit Umpqua to locate those improvements on the remaining portions of the land, which are still suitable for farm use. Wetherell again appealed, and LUBA again remanded. <em>Wetherell v. Douglas County, </em>56 Or LUBA 120 (2008) <em>(Wetherell II). </em>Although this time LUBA concluded that the record was adequate to support the county\u2019s findings about the unsuitability of the .3-acre portion of Umpqua\u2019s land, it concluded for a second time that the improvements (with the exception of the driveway) also must be located on that portion of the land, not on the portion that remains suitable for farm use.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-6\">On remand, Wetherell offered evidence that, in 2006, Umpqua had proceeded with the drilling of a well located outside of the .3-acre portion of the property that had been found to be unsuitable for farm use. The county declined to reopen the record to receive such evidence. The county then again approved Umpqua\u2019s application to build a non-farm dwelling on its EFU land. The county included the following condition of approval:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b360-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>\u201cThe Land Use Board of Appeals has concluded that \u2018the term \u201cdwelling\u201d as used in ORS 215.284 includes any essential or accessory improvements or structures and, therefore, like the dwelling itself, those essential or accessory improvements and structures are authorized only on portions of the farm parcel that are generally unsuitable.\u2019 Accordingly, the Board finds that the proposed non-farm dwelling, and any essential or accessory improvements or structures <em>to be built or installed </em>in conjunction with the building (except for a driveway providing access to the dwelling), including the service lines connecting the dwelling to the water system and the septic system, will be located on the unsuitable portion of the property.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b360-4\">(Citation omitted; emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b360-5\">Wetherell again appealed to LUBA, arguing that, among other things, the county\u2019s condition \u2014 which prohibits essential or accessory improvements \u201cto be built or installed\u201d \u2014 merely prohibits new construction and effectively allows Umpqua to locate such improvements on suitable land if they already have been installed. LUBA agreed. <em>Wetherell v. Douglas County, </em>57 Or LUBA 434 (2008). LUBA concluded that it certainly is possible to read the county\u2019s condition that way. According to LUBA,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b360-6\">\u201cthe county is not entitled to insert an ambiguity into its findings and conditions of approval that would assist [Umpqua] in avoiding the clear requirement in <em>Wetherell I </em>and <em>Wetherell II </em>that the water system and septic system for the disputed nonfarm dwelling must be located on the generally unsuitable .3-acre portion of the property.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b360-7\">LUBA therefore remanded the case again to \u201celiminate the ambiguity.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b360-8\">In its first assignment of error, Umpqua contends that LUBA erred in remanding the case yet again. According to Umpqua, in remanding the case because of the ambiguity of the county\u2019s order, LUBA effectively has created an unlawful requirement that local government decisions be \u201cclear.\u201d According to Umpqua, requiring local government decisions to be clear \u201csets an erroneously high standard which will cause substantial hardship to land owners and local governments across the state.\u201d Umpqua argues that what LUBA <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>should have done is give the county the benefit of a \u201cpresumption that a local government\u2019s decision in a land use context is valid, reasonable, and correct.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b361-4\">We reject Umpqua\u2019s first assignment of error. LUBA did not create a new and \u201cerroneously high\u201d standard of review. It simply determined that it could not tell what the county meant when it imposed the condition that essential or accessory improvements \u201cto be built\u201d must be located on land unsuitable for farming. Even Umpqua does not contest that the condition could be read to apply only to such improvements not already built, which would be directly contrary to LUBA\u2019s decisions in <em>Wetherell I </em>and <em>Wetherell II. </em>In remanding for the county to clarify the condition \u2014 rather than reversing the decision outright \u2014 LUBA did, in fact, give the county the benefit of the doubt. <em>Cf. Just v. City of Lebanon (A122516), </em>193 Or App 121, 130, 88 P3d 307 (2004), <em>rev dismissed, </em>342 Or 117 (2006) (upholding LUBA remand of local government decision because LUBA \u201cdid not know what the city meant\u201d by certain phrasing in its decision).</p>\n<p id=\"b361-5\">In its second assignment of error, Umpqua contends that LUBA erred in relying on evidence outside the record\u2014 specifically, evidence that it already had installed a water and septic system on the portion of its property that remains suitable for farm use. Umpqua acknowledges that LUBA expressly disclaimed relying on that evidence. It nevertheless insists that LUBA <em>must </em>have relied on it, or else it would not have found the county\u2019s decision unclear. We reject the second assignment without discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-6\">In its final assignment of error, Umpqua contends that LUBA erred in construing ORS 215.284(2) to prohibit the installation of essential or accessory improvements on land that remains suitable for farm use. According to Umpqua, the \u201cdwelling\u201d that the statute requires to be constructed on land unsuitable for farm use is limited to the building itself and does not include essential or accessory improvements such as water and septic systems. That is an interesting question, to be sure. But it also is one that LUBA addressed in <em>Wetherell II. </em>Umpqua did not seek judicial review of LUBA\u2019s decision on that issue then. Consequently, it cannot obtain judicial review of it now. <em>Beck v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number><em>City of Tillamook, </em>313 Or 148, 151, 831 P2d 678 (1992) (appellate courts cannot review issues that LUBA decided in an earlier order in the same case, for which judicial review was not sought).</p>\n<p id=\"b362-4\">Umpqua insists that it is not precluded from raising the issue now because LUBA\u2019s most recent order is different in a material respect. According to Umpqua, LUBA\u2019s order in <em>Wetherell II </em>merely held that improvements such as water or septic systems \u201cauthorized\u201d under ORS 215.284(2) must be located on the portion of the land that is not suitable for farm use. In its most recent order, Umpqua argues, LUBA went further and held that any nonfarm dwelling authorized under the statute \u201cmust be\u201d connected to such water and septic systems located on the portion of the land not suitable for farm use.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-5\">The problem is that, even assuming the correctness of Umpqua\u2019s characterization of LUBA\u2019s most recent order, what Umpqua then proceeds to argue is that the term \u201cdwelling,\u201d as it is used in ORS 215.284(2), does not include such improvements as water and septic systems. That is precisely the same issue that LUBA decided in <em>Wetherell II, </em>and it may not be challenged at this juncture.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
