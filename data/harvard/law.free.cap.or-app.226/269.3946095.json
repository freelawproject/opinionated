In a <em>pro se </em>supplemental brief, defendant argues that the trial court erroneously determined the length of his sentence. We reject without discussion defendant\u2019s arguments concerning his motion for judgment of acquittal and the length of his sentence. Regarding merger of the convictions, the state concedes that the trial court erred. As explained below, we agree, and, consequently, remand for merger of the convictions and for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-5\">Defendant was charged, in three separate counts, with burglary. Each count alleged a different theory for the same unlawful entry into a dwelling. The parties agreed at sentencing that, under <em>State v. White, </em>341 Or 624, 147 P3d 313 (2006), the convictions should merge. However, the judgment indicated that the three counts \u201cshall merge for sentencing purposes.\u201d Thus, the trial court did not merge the convictions themselves but, instead, only ordered that the sentences on those convictions run concurrently.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-6\">On appeal, defendant reiterates that, under <em>White, </em>the convictions must merge. We agree that <em>White </em>is directly on point. <em>See id. </em>at 640-41 (\u201c[W]e conclude that, although defendant properly was charged with and even found guilty of two counts of first-degree burglary, each of which alleged a different crime that defendant intended to commit at the time of his unlawful entry, the trial court could not enter two judgments of convictions based on those verdicts.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b304-7\">Reversed and remanded with instructions to merge burglary convictions and for resentencing; otherwise affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
