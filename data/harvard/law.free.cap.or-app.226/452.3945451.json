She asserts that (1) the trial court erred in denying her request for a continuance of the hearing on father\u2019s objection to her petition for guardianship; (2) the court erred in failing to hold a hearing within the meaning of ORS 125.075(3) and ORS 125.080(2) when it did not permit her to present her evidence at the hearing; and (3) the court\u2019s failure to hold such a hearing resulted in a deprivation of her \u201cdue process\u201d rights under the state and federal constitutions. We agree with grandmother as to her second assignment of error, and, therefore, reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-5\">The relevant facts are undisputed. At the time of the hearing, mother and father were separated and contemplating divorce. D and J were living with father in a home that he shared with two other adults; mother was living with father\u2019s parents.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-6\">On March 8, 2007, grandmother filed a petition for guardianship of the children, alleging that they were being abused and neglected, and further alleging three periods (two and one-half months, one week, and two and one-half weeks, respectively) during which she had a \u201cchild-parent relationship\u201d with the children. ORS 109.119.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Father filed a motion to dismiss on the grounds that grandmother did not have a \u201cchild-parent relationship\u201d with D or J and, in fact, had not had any contact with them in the previous 11 months; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>mother also objected to grandmother\u2019s petition. At the initial hearing on the petition, held on July 27, 2007, the court did not take any testimony but appointed a visitor, <em>see </em>ORS 125.025(3)(c) (authorizing the appointment of \u201cinvestigators, visitors and experts\u201d in protective proceedings) to interview the parties and prepare a report. At that hearing, grandmother \u2014 who was then represented by counsel \u2014 was also served with a restraining order that had previously been entered in December 2006.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b499-4\">The visitor filed her report on August 29, 2007, recommending denial of grandmother\u2019s petition for guardianship. Another hearing was scheduled for November 16,2007. Mother moved for a continuance of that hearing because she was in the process of retaining an attorney after her previous attorney had withdrawn on August 24; the hearing was subsequently rescheduled for December 14. Notice was sent to the parties indicating that the purpose of the December 14 hearing was to consider \u201cOBJECTION TO APPOINTMENT OF GUARDIAN.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b499-5\">In the meantime, mother apparently filed a motion to continue her restraining order against grandmother.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Although nothing in the record before us indicates that the two matters were consolidated for hearing on December 14, when the parties appeared on that date,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> there was some confusion as to the matters pending before the court. The court indicated that the only purpose of the hearing was to consider mother\u2019s request for a renewal of the restraining order. Grandmother, however, requested a continuance of the hearing on her petition for guardianship. She argued that she needed additional time to hire an attorney and to amend her petition to further support her assertion that she was a \u201cpsychological parent\u201d of the children. She also argued that, although one of her witnesses was present, two others were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>unavailable due to the late start of the hearing, and she wanted the opportunity to subpoena others.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-4\">The visitor objected to grandmother\u2019s request to continue the guardianship proceeding because it had already been continued numerous times, the court had advised grandmother that the previous continuance was the last one, and it was not necessarily in the children\u2019s best interest to delay. The court then stated, \u201cI\u2019m going to deny your request in the guardianship. And on the \u2014 I\u2019ll continue on the restraining order. I\u2019ll continue the restraining order for another six months to give you time to get your case together.\u201d When grandmother indicated her lack of understanding of the court\u2019s decision, the court stated, \u201cI\u2019m continuing it, and I\u2019ll give you six months and I\u2019m going to renew the restraining order for six months.\u201d Grandmother again objected. The court responded, \u201cYou wanted to have further \u2014 you wanted to continue the matter. So, in order to continue the matter I\u2019m going to place it in status quo.\u201d And, after further discussion, the court stated, \u201cWell, if you\u2019re asking to continue this, you know, I don\u2019t \u2014 I don\u2019t think any further evidence is \u2014 is necessary.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b500-5\">The court then reiterated that guardianship was denied. Grandmother continued to object, complaining that the court was not \u201clistening to any of my evidence whatsoever\u201d and \u201cyou\u2019ve been very unfair not to call my witness or listen to any evidence,\u201d despite the fact that one of her witnesses was present. The court responded, \u201cI don\u2019t want to hear this piecem[ea]l, let\u2019s set it over and * * * if you don\u2019t get it settled within that six months we\u2019ll have a hearing at that time.\u201d After more discussion, grandmother again asked to call her witness who was present and the court stated, \u201cNo, not now[,]\u201d and \u201c[I\u2019m] setting it all over.\u201d A few minutes later, however, when grandmother again asked that her witness be allowed to testify, the court stated that it had made its ruling \u2014 that is, that the guardianship was <em>\u201cdenied </em>and the restraining order is continued for six months.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Grandmother responded, \u2018Well, I\u2019m going to ask that that be changed. You\u2019re not giving me an opportunity to bring my witness forward or anything.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b501-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>The court subsequently entered a judgment denying grandmother\u2019s petition for guardianship, finding, \u201c[a]fter review of the Visitor\u2019s Report and discussions with the parties and the court visitor,\u201d that the proposed guardianship would not be in the children\u2019s best interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-4\">On appeal, grandmother asserts that the court (1) abused its discretion in failing to grant her request for a continuance; (2) erred as a matter of law in failing to hold a hearing within the meaning of ORS 125.075(3) and ORS 125.080(2) on father\u2019s objection to her petition for guardianship; and (3) erred in depriving grandmother of her \u201cdue process rights\u201d under Article I, section 10, of the Oregon Constitution and the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-5\">Because it is dispositive, we begin with grandmother\u2019s second assignment of error. Grandmother filed her petition for guardianship under ORS chapter 125, pertaining to protective proceedings. ORS 125.010 allows any person who is interested in the affairs or welfare of a respondent to file a petition for the appointment of a fiduciary, including a guardian. ORS 125.075(1) authorizes persons entitled to receive notice of the petition \u2014 including, as specified in ORS 125.060, the parents of the respondent \u2014 to present objections to a guardianship petition. ORS 125.075(3) provides that, if any of those persons present objections \u2014 which, in this case, both mother and father did \u2014 \u201cthe court shall schedule a hearing on the objections.\u201d ORS 125.080 further provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b501-6\">\u201c(1) The court may require that a hearing be held on any petition or motion in a protective proceeding.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b501-7\">\u201c(2) A hearing <em>must </em>be held on a petition or motion if an objection is filed to the petition or motion and the objection is not withdrawn before the time scheduled for the hearing.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b501-8\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b501-9\">Thus, because objections to grandmother\u2019s petition for guardianship had been filed and not withdrawn, the court was required, under ORS 125.080(2), to hold a hearing on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>that petition.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In the absence of any limitations in the statute itself, the term \u201chearing\u201d contemplates the calling of witnesses. <em>Miller and Miller, </em>128 Or App 433, 434, 875 P2d 1195 (1994). In <em>Miller, </em>the issue was whether, at a hearing on a restraining order issued under the Family Abuse Prevention Act, ORS 107.700 through 107.735, the trial court erred in denying the person against whom the order was entered the opportunity to call witnesses other than himself. In a per curiam opinion, we held that it did, explaining:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b502-4\">\u201cThe word \u2018hearing\u2019 has a common meaning: It is a proceeding similar to a trial in which parties have a right to be heard and issues of fact or law are to be determined. <em>See Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>649 (5th ed 1979). Consequently, the word \u2018hearing\u2019 contemplates the calling of witnesses. A fact germane to an issue under the statute may not be provable without testimony from a witness who is not a party. The legislature would not have intended to prohibit testimony necessary to effectuate the purposes of the statute.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b502-5\">128 Or App at 434; <em>see also Nelson v. Nelson, </em>142 Or App 367, 369, 921 P2d 412 (1996) (the term \u201chearing\u201d in ORS 107.718(10)<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> \u201ccontemplates both the sworn testimony of the parties themselves and the examination under oath of other witnesses on relevant matters\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b502-6\">Such is the case in this context as well. Neither ORS 125.075(3) nor ORS 125.080 expresses any limitations on witnesses or evidence; in short, there is nothing to indicate that the legislature intended anything other than the common meaning of the term \u201chearing\u201d to apply to a hearing required under ORS 125.075(3) and ORS 125.080.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-7\">Father and mother argue that the court had the discretion to exclude grandmother\u2019s witness under OEC 403<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>the grounds that that evidence would be unnecessarily cumulative and cause undue delay. The flaw in father\u2019s and mother\u2019s argument is that the trial court did not rule that the evidence was excluded under OEC 403; rather, the court did not allow grandmother to proffer the evidence at all. She was denied the opportunity to call witnesses, to cross-examine the visitor or the other parties\u2019 witnesses, and to testify herself as to relevant matters. The trial court denied the guardianship petition without allowing any testimony to be presented by grandmother to contest the objections to her petition. The trial court thus erred in failing to hold a hearing within the meaning of ORS 125.075(3) and ORS 125.080.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-4\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b498-7\"> Among other things, ORS 109.119 authorizes a person, including a grandparent, who has established emotional ties creating a child-parent relationship with a child, to petition for guardianship of the child. ORS 109.119(1), (3). \u201cChild-parent relationship\u201d means</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b498-8\">\u201ca relationship that exists or did exist, in whole or in part, within the six months preceding the filing of an action under this section, and in which relationship a person having physical custody of a child or residing in the same household as the child supplied, or otherwise made available to the child, food, clothing, shelter and incidental necessaries and provided the child with necessary care, education and discipline, and which relationship continued on a day-to-day basis, through interaction, companionship, interplay and mutuality, that fulfilled the child\u2019s psychological needs for a parent as well as the child\u2019s physical needs.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b498-9\">ORS 109.119(10)(a).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b499-6\"> That order is not in the record before us and it is unclear whether it prohibited grandmother from coming into contact with the children, or only from coming into contact with mother. Resolution of that factual dispute is immaterial to our decision in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b499-7\"> Again, that motion is not part of the record in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b499-8\"> All parties appeared <em>pro se.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b502-8\"> The colloquy with the court, rather confusingly, suggests that the court was considering setting over the guardianship matter as requested by grandmother; in fact, the judgment confirms that the court denied the petition without any witnesses being called.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b502-9\"> At the time, the relevant provision was ORS 107.718(8). It has since been renumbered as ORS 107.718(10).
