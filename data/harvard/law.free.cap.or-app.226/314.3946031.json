J.</author>\n<p id=\"b352-4\">Defendant appeals a judgment of conviction for disorderly conduct in the second degree. ORS 166.025. He assigns error to the trial court\u2019s denial of his motion for a judgment of acquittal, arguing that the evidence was insufficient to prove that he \u201cengage[d] in fighting or in violent, tumultuous or threatening behavior\u201d within the meaning of the offense statute. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-5\">The relevant facts are undisputed. One afternoon, at about 4:00 p.m., defendant was walking down the sidewalk in front of a gas and auto service station. On the sidewalk in front of the station was a three-foot-tall, metal, sandwich-board-style \u201cHelp Wanted\u201d sign. As he walked by, defendant kicked the sign off the sidewalk into the middle of a busy four-lane road. The station owner followed defendant to ask him to stop kicking the sign. Once the station owner got defendant\u2019s attention, however, defendant turned around but did not speak. Instead, defendant pulled a glove from his pocket, put the glove on one hand and made a fist, and repeatedly punched his fist into his other hand. Feeling threatened, the station owner backed away and called the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-6\">On the basis of those events, defendant was charged with two counts of second-degree disorderly conduct \u2014 one for kicking the sign and the other for his threatening gestures toward the station owner. For both counts, the state alleged that defendant \u201cdid unlawfully and recklessly create a risk of public inconvenience, annoyance and alarm, by engaging in fighting or in violent, tumultuous or threatening behavior.\u201d At trial, after the state\u2019s case-in-chief, defendant moved for a judgment of acquittal on both counts. The trial court granted defendant\u2019s motion with respect to the charge based on the threatening gestures, but denied the motion with respect to the charge based on kicking the sign. The jury convicted defendant on the remaining charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-7\">Defendant appeals, contending that the trial court erred in denying his motion for a judgment of acquittal because the evidence is undisputed that he did not use physical force against another person. When reviewing the denial of such a motion, we examine the record and all reasonable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>inferences that may be drawn from it in the light most favorable to the state to determine whether a rational factfinder could have found all the elements of the offense beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>State v. Cunningham, </em>320 Or 47, 63, 880 P2d 431 (1994), <em>cert den, </em>514 US 1005 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b353-4\">The statute under which defendant was charged provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b353-5\">\u201c(1) A person commits the crime of disorderly conduct in the second degree if, with intent to cause public inconvenience, annoyance or alarm, or recklessly creating a risk thereof, the person:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b353-6\">\u201c(a) Engages in fighting or in violent, tumultuous or threatening behaviorf]\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b353-7\">ORS 166.025. We construed the terms \u201cfighting\u201d and \u201cviolent, tumultuous or threatening behavior\u201d in <em>State v. Cantwell, </em>66 Or App 848, 676 P2d 353, <em>rev den, </em>297 Or 124 (1984). In that case, we stated that those terms relate to \u201cphysical acts of aggression.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 852 (rejecting the defendant\u2019s argument that the statute is unconstitutionally over-broad). We further stated that the statute \u201cmakes unlawful only the use of physical force or physical conduct which is immediately likely to produce the use of such force and which is intended to create or recklessly creates a risk of public inconvenience, annoyance or alarm.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 853 (rejecting the defendant\u2019s contention that the statute is unconstitutionally vague).</p>\n<p id=\"b353-8\">Thus, a person violates ORS 166.025(l)(a) if he or she, with the requisite mental state, either (1) uses physical force or (2) engages in physical conduct that is immediately likely to produce the use of physical force. <em>See State v. Atwood, </em>195 Or App 490, 497-98, 98 P3d 751 (2004). In <em>Atwood, </em>we noted that the common meaning of \u201cphysical force\u201d \u201cconnotes the actual use of strength or power.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 498. It does not include \u201cactual but incidental physical contact,\u201d however. <em>Id.; accord State ex rel Juv. Dept. v. Krieger, </em>177 Or App 156, 161, 33 P3d 351 (2001) (\u201cWhile grabbing hold of someone\u2019s shoulder is a physical act, it is also a common method of gaining someone\u2019s attention and does not rise to the level of physical force required under [ORS 166.025(l)(a)].\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b354-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>In this case, defendant insists that kicking the sign did not violate ORS 166.025(l)(a). Regarding the first prong of the <em>Atwood </em>analysis, defendant does not dispute that kicking the sign was an \u201cactual use of strength or power.\u201d Instead, defendant asserts that, because he \u201cdid not use physical force against anyone,\u201d his conduct was not a \u201cphysical act[ ] of aggression\u201d that is proscribed by the statute. According to defendant, kicking the sign \u201cwas simply an act of frustration because the sign was impeding [his] path.\u201d He analogizes that act to the incidental physical conduct in <em>Krieger </em>that we determined did not constitute \u201cphysical force\u201d for the purposes of ORS 166.025(l)(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b354-4\">We disagree. Defendant\u2019s act of kicking the sign constituted the use of physical force; he kicked it hard enough that it landed in the middle of the road, demonstrating an \u201cactual use of strength or power.\u201d It was not, as defendant asserts, merely incidental physical conduct. He did not kick the sign as \u201ca common method of gaining someone\u2019s attention\u201d; instead, he kicked the sign because he was frustrated that it was blocking the sidewalk. Furthermore, we reject defendant\u2019s contention that the physical force must be directed at a person. Neither the words of the statute nor our cases construing it limit the proscribed conduct in the way that defendant suggests.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-5\">Alternatively, defendant argues that there was no evidence that his conduct was immediately likely to produce the use of physical force. <em>Atwood, </em>195 Or App at 498. According to defendant, his conduct did not violate ORS 166.025(l)(a) because \u201cthere was never a threat of any sort of physical confrontation between defendant and [the station owner].\u201d Those contentions pertain to the second prong of the <em>Atwood </em>analysis. Because we have concluded that the first prong is established in this case (that kicking the sign constituted \u201cphysical force\u201d), whether defendant\u2019s conduct meets the second prong is irrelevant.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-6\">Given that defendant used physical force when he kicked a sign into a busy four-lane road, a rational factfinder could have concluded that, in doing so, defendant recklessly created a risk of public inconvenience, annoyance, or alarm. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>Thus, the trial court correctly denied defendant\u2019s motion for a judgment of acquittal.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
