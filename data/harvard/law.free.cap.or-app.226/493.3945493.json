J.</author>\n<p id=\"b539-4\">Defendant appeals a judgment of conviction for driving under the influence of intoxicants (DUII). Relying on <em>State v. Jayne, </em>173 Or App 533, 24 P3d 920 (2001), defendant asserts that the trial court erred in admitting the results of a urine test indicating the presence of Valium and marijuana metabolites in his urine when the results of the test were not confirmed with a quantitative test. Because we conclude that a quantitative test is not required for the evidence at issue to be admissible in a DUII case, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-5\">On August 27, 2004, after observing defendant\u2019s vehicle cross over the center line of the road, Groshang, a City of Beaverton Police Officer, pulled the vehicle over. Groshang found defendant behind the wheel of the vehicle and observed that he was slow and lethargic. In response to Groshang\u2019s inquiry as to whether he had taken any medications, defendant informed the officer that he had taken Ativan and Valium, medications for which he had prescriptions. Groshang then contacted Debolt, a City of Beaverton Police Officer who is certified as a drug recognition expert and instructor.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-6\">When Debolt arrived at the scene, he asked defendant about the medications defendant was taking based on the information Debolt received from Groshang. Defendant responded that he had taken Ativan. Debolt observed that defendant\u2019s eyes were bloodshot and watery, his eyelids were relaxed and droopy, his face was pale, and his speech was slurred and difficult to understand. Believing defendant to be intoxicated, Debolt then asked defendant to perform some field sobriety tests. Defendant agreed to allow Debolt to look in his eyes and conduct a horizontal gaze nystagmus test. The results of that test indicated that defendant was impaired. Accordingly, Debolt placed defendant under arrest for DUII.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-7\">Following the arrest, Debolt took defendant to the police station and administered a breath test that registered a blood alcohol level of 0.00 percent. The officer also completed the full battery of drug recognition evaluation (DRE) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>tests, including collecting a urine sample from defendant.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Debolt concluded that defendant was \u201cunder the influence of [a] central nervous system depressant\u201d and was unable to drive.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-4\">The urine sample was sent to Oregon State Police Crime Laboratory, which is certified by the American Society of Crime Laboratory Directors, to be tested for the presence of controlled substances. The tests showed that Valium, a Valium metabolite, and a marijuana metabolite were present in defendant\u2019s urine. Although the presence of those substances was confirmed, the lab did not test to determine the quantity of the drugs in the urine. The forensic scientist who <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>testified at trial stated it was not the practice of the laboratory to test for the quantity of drugs in urine.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-4\">Defendant filed a pretrial motion to exclude the results of the urine test based on <em>Jayne, </em>OEC 401, and OEC 403. Defendant further moved to exclude the DRE evidence \u201cunless all twelve steps [were] first shown to have been performed.\u201d At argument on his motion, defendant asserted that the test results should be excluded due to the laboratory\u2019s failure to perform a quantitative test. The court concluded that a quantitative analysis was not required for the test results to be admissible. As to the admission of the DRE evidence, defendant indicated to the court that he intended to object if one of the DRE steps was not performed, and the trial court deferred its ruling. When the urinalysis results were offered at trial, defendant objected to their admission. However, during the trial he made no objection to the other DRE evidence. Ultimately, the jury convicted defendant of DUII.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-5\">Defendant contends that the urinalysis evidence was inadmissible as scientific evidence as a matter of law as a result of this court\u2019s holding in <em>Jayne </em>because \u201cthe urine was tested only for the presence of drugs and was not tested for the quantity of drugs.\u201d (Emphasis omitted.) Defendant posits that because \u201cthis is a DUII case, the implied consent statute, ORS 813.131, establishes the foundational requirements for the admission of evidence, not the more general evidence statute[.]\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b542-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>In <em>Jayne, </em>this court affirmed a trial court order excluding results of urine testing pursuant to OEC 403. In that case, the defendant was charged with manslaughter, DUII, and failure to perform the duties of a driver following an incident in which she struck and killed a pedestrian. The defendant in that case was not charged with a controlled-substance-related DUII. 173 Or App at 538-39. Accordingly, we determined that urinalysis evidence was not relevant to the DUII charge and considered whether the evidence should be admissible with respect to charges of manslaughter and failure to perform the duties of a driver. <em>Id. </em>at 539. We concluded that the failure of the laboratory in that case to perform \u201cconfirmatory quantitative testing\u201d indicated the evidence had a weak foundation as scientific evidence that, in turn, negatively affected the probative value of the evidence. <em>Id. </em>at 542-44. We noted that the urinalysis evidence had limited probative value \u201cbecause of the conceded lack of direct correlation between the urinalysis test results and impairment at the time of the accident.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 544. We also ruled that the danger of unfair prejudice was high because the jury could infer that the defendant \u201cwas a reckless person and was likely to have been acting in a reckless manner at the time of the accident\u201d or that there was necessarily a \u201ccorrelation between the drugs in her urine and her physical or mental condition at the time of the accident.\u201d Our holding in <em>Jayne </em>did not, as defendant asserts, make urinalysis evidence inadmissible in every case where quantitative test results are not obtained. <em>Id. </em>at 543 (noting that in that case the \u201cdefendant did not argue, and the trial court did not find, that the [urinalysis] evidence was so lacking in foundation that it was inadmissible <em>per se </em>under OEC 702\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b542-4\"> Further, this case is clearly distinguishable from <em>Jayne, </em>and its result is not controlling here. Unlike <em>Jayne, </em>defendant in this case was charged with a controlled <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>substance DUII. That charge makes urine test results demonstrating the presence of controlled substances in his urine highly probative. As this court explained in <em>State v. Moody, </em>201 Or App 58, 64, 116 P3d 935, <em>rev den, </em>339 Or 609 (2005), <em>modified on recons, </em>207 Or App 304, 140 P3d 1171, <em>rev den, </em>342 Or 46 (2006), \u201cto convict a defendant of a controlled substance DUII, the state must not only prove impairment, but must also prove that the impairment was due to a controlled substance.\u201d In light of that requirement, urine test results \u201cshowing the presence of a controlled substance in a defendant\u2019s body is direct evidence from which a trier of fact can infer, along with other evidence of impairment, that a defendant\u2019s impairment was due to the influence of a controlled substance.\u201d <em>Id. </em>As we also observed in <em>Moody, </em>ORS 813.131(1), which deems motorists to have impliedly consented to urine testing \u201cfor the purpose of determining the presence of a controlled substance or inhalant in the person\u2019s body if the person is arrested for driving while under the influence of intoxicants[,]\u201d demonstrates the legislature\u2019s recognition \u201cthat urinalysis evidence is relevant to proving an essential element of the offense of a controlled substance DUII.\u201d <em>Moody, </em>201 Or App at 65.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-4\">Defendant in this case was charged with a controlled substance DUII. For that reason, unlike <em>Jayne, </em>this case falls squarely within the purview of ORS 813.131, which was amended in 1999.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> As a result of that amendment, ORS 813.131(4) provides that \u201c[a] chemical analysis of a person\u2019s urine under this section shall be performed in an accredited or licensed toxicology laboratory.\u201d Prior to the amendment, that section required that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b543-5\">\u201c[t]he detection levels and results of urine tests given under this section shall conform to rules and guidelines of the National Institute of Drug Abuse [NIDA] of the United States Department of Health and Human Services.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b543-6\">ORS 813.131(4) (1997). The NIDA guidelines required, among other things, that urinalysis test results be confirmed with a quantitative test. <em>See State v. Chipman, </em>176 Or App <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>284, 287-88, 31 P3d 478 (2001) (describing the NIDA testing protocol). The amended statute, in contrast, no longer requires compliance with the NIDA guidelines and, therefore, does not require quantitative testing. The legislature\u2019s elimination of the requirement that quantitative testing be conducted implies that the legislature intended that such quantitative tests not be performed as part of urinalysis testing under ORS 813.131. <em>See State v. Webb, </em>324 Or 380, 390, 927 P2d 79 (1996) (\u201cenacted legislative changes are part of a statute\u2019s context\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b544-4\">Nonetheless, defendant argues that urinalysis test results remain inadmissible as scientific evidence in the absence of quantitative testing. Because the text and context of ORS 813.131 do not expressly dispense with the need for quantitative testing, the statute could plausibly be read to support either the state\u2019s or defendant\u2019s position. We therefore turn to the legislative history underlying the statutory amendment.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b544-5\">The amendments initially proposed by the Oregon State Police would have changed ORS 813.131(4) to read as follows: \u201cThe initial cutoff levels used for the screening tests of urine specimens given under this section shall conform to the rules and guidelines of the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration of the United States Department of Human Services * * Senate Bill (SB) 242 (1999) (as introduced). The changes were, in part, intended to clarify that quantification of the amount of drugs in urine was not required as part of a confirmatory test. Tape Recording, Senate Committee on the Judiciary, SB 242, Feb 17, 1999, Tape 41, Side B (statement of Julia Hinkley, Oregon State Police Crime Laboratory). That was because \u201c[q]uantitation of the drugs identified in urine gives no useful information as to the level of impairment of a particular individual.\u201d Testimony, Senate Committee on the Judiciary, SB 242, Feb 17, 1999, Ex T (statement of Julia Hinkley). Further, there was concern that quantitative urine tests would \u201clead to increased analysis turn around time and increased costs.\u201d <em>Id. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>Chuck Hayes of the Oregon State Police also appeared in support of the proposed changes. Minutes, Senate Committee on the Judiciary, SB 242, Feb 17, 1999.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-4\">Raymond Grimsbo from Intermountain Forensic Laboratories appeared in opposition to the bill. He expressed his concern that, as written, the bill would eliminate the requirement that confirmatory testing be performed on urine samples submitted, and that it was important that a confirmatory test be completed. Tape Recording, Senate Committee on the Judiciary, SB 242, Feb 17, 1999, Tape 41, Side B (statement of Raymond Grimsbo, forensic scientist). Hinkley responded that confirmatory tests would continue to be performed, but that the concern was that when a quantitative result from urine tests is reported, there is a misleading appearance created that the number reported has some meaning in terms of the level of impairment. Further, when the information is introduced into a court proceeding, it may be misrepresented as meaning something that it does not.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Tape Recording, Senate Committee on the Judiciary, SB 242, Feb 17, 1999, Tape 41, Side B (statement of Julia Hinkley).</p>\n<p id=\"b545-5\">Following the public hearing, the bill was amended to remove all reference to the federal standards and require only that the urine tests be performed in an accredited or licensed laboratory. According to the legislative history, that change was to ensure that the analysis was performed in a scientifically acceptable fashion. Tape Recording, Senate Committee on the Judiciary, SB 242, Apr 14, 1999, Tape 121, Side B (statement of Charles Hayes, Oregon State Police). However, the intent remained to eliminate any requirement that quantitative tests be required for urine samples obtained pursuant to the implied consent statute. <em>See </em>Tape Recording, Senate Committee on the Judiciary, SB 242, Apr 14, 1999, Tape 121, Side B (statement of Julia Hinkley) (discussing quantification of test results); Tape Recording, Senate Committee on the Judiciary, SB 242, Apr 14, 1999, Tape 121, Side B (statement of Ingrid Swenson, Oregon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>Criminal Defense Lawyers Association) (opposing bill, noting that no quantitative testing would be performed); <em>see also </em>Staff Measure Summary, Joint Committee of Ways and Means, SB 242, June 1 and 4, 1999 (fiscal impact if bill not passed; high levels of testing result in significant additional costs). Both the Senate and the House ultimately adopted SB 242 in its amended form.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-4\">Thus, although the statute does not expressly say so, it is clear from the legislative history that the legislature intended that a quantitative analysis is <em>not </em>required as a condition of admissibility. Accordingly, the legislature has recognized the importance of urinalysis evidence in DUII controlled substance cases and determined that it will not require quantitative urine test results in such cases. Moreover, the testimony and concerns addressed before the legislature clearly evidences the understanding that the results of urine tests obtained under the statute can be used to prosecute DUII cases.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In light of the legislature\u2019s intent, we conclude that the trial court\u2019s admission of the urinalysis evidence was not error.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b540-5\"> As explained in <em>State v. Sampson, </em>the 12 DRE protocol steps are as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b540-6\">\u201c1. A blood alcohol content (BAC) analysis is done.
