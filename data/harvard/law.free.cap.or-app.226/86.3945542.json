J.</author>\n<p id=\"b112-4\">This case is before us on remand from the Supreme Court, which vacated our prior decision, <em>State v. Steele, </em>205 Or App 469, 134 P3d 1054 (2006) <em>(Steele I), </em>in light of <em>State v. Ramirez, </em>343 Or 505, 173 P3d 817 (2007), <em>adh\u2019d to as modified on recons, </em>344 Or 195, 179 P3d 673 (2008), and <em>State v. Fults, </em>343 Or 515, 173 P3d 822 (2007). <em>State v. Steele, </em>345 Or 316, 195 P3d 64 (2008). In <em>Steele I, </em>we vacated defendant\u2019s sentences and remanded for resentencing because the trial court had imposed a departure sentence based on judicial findings that defendant was persistently involved in similar offenses and that he was on probation when he committed his current crime. That factfinding constituted plain error, and we exercised our discretion to correct it. The issue before us on remand is whether, in light of <em>Ramirez </em>and <em>Fults, </em>we properly exercised our discretion under <em>Ailes v. Portland Meadows, Inc., </em>312 Or 376, 381-82, 823 P2d 956 (1991). We conclude that our exercise of discretion in <em>Steele I </em>was erroneous. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-5\">Defendant was convicted of first-degree burglary. The trial court imposed a durational departure sentence of 68 months\u2019 imprisonment. The court gave the following reasons for its departure:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b112-6\">\u201c[Defendant], none of us have anything to say here. It\u2019s all been said. 41 strikes and you\u2019re out. You\u2019ve heard three strikes. 41 and you\u2019re really out.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b112-7\">\u2018You have told all of us in the system that if we don\u2019t lock you up you will continue to commit crimes. That\u2019s all I can conclude. I refuse to even waste a whole lot of energy getting incensed about this.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b112-8\">\u00ab\u00edji * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b112-9\">\u201cIf I don\u2019t lock you up, you are going to go into somebody\u2019s house and come out in a body bag. That\u2019s the way I see it. And nobody will care. Nobody will care. Maybe your family will care, but they\u2019re shrugging their shoulders saying, well gee, if the judge locked him up like we told him to, he would still be alive. You will be shot in somebody\u2019s house some day, I\u2019ll guarantee it. If I don\u2019t put you in prison.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b112-10\">\u2021 \u2021 \u2021 *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b113-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>\u201cThis is obviously a case for departure based upon prior, persistent involvement in criminal similar activity. The case is to depart based on the fact you were on probation when you committed this crime. And that\u2019s what\u2019s called for. Somebody is supposed to get the maximum sentence, it\u2019s guys like you.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b113-4\">In this case, the trial court did not explicitly state that it was relying on the departure factors it found either singly or in combination, and therefore we assume that the court did not consider each factor to be independently sufficient to support a departure. <em>State v. Wilson, </em>111 Or App 147, 826 P2d 1010 (1992). Thus, remand for resentencing may be warranted if any one of the factors relied on by the trial court is subject to legitimate debate. <em>See Ramirez, </em>343 Or at 513 (setting out \u201clegitimate debate\u201d standard for exercise of discretion to review unpreserved challenges to departure sentences based on judicial findings of fact). We turn first to the court\u2019s departure based on defendant\u2019s persistent involvement in similar offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-5\">As we explained in <em>State v. Williams, </em>225 Or App 325, 328-29, 201 P3d 267 (2009), under <em>State v. Bray, </em>342 Or 711, 724, 160 P3d 983 (2007), there is no legitimate debate that a jury would have found a defendant to have been persistently involved in similar offenses where the number and frequency of the defendant\u2019s prior convictions compels the inference that his or her criminal behavior has been \u201cpersistent.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b113-6\">On this record, we conclude that there is no legitimate debate that the jury would have found defendant to have been persistently involved in similar offenses. While being cross-examined by the state, defendant admitted to having 30 convictions in the 11 years before the trial in this case, including 10 convictions for forgery, one conviction for attempted burglary, one for first-degree theft, and one for second-degree theft. That evidence was uncontroverted and, to our mind, overwhelming to show that defendant had been persistently involved in similar offenses to his current crime of conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-7\">We reach the same conclusion with regard to the departure factor of defendant\u2019s probation status at the time <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>he committed his crimes. As we explained in <em>State v. Allen, </em>198 Or App 392, 396, 108 P3d 651, <em>adh\u2019d to as clarified on recons, </em>202 Or App 565, 123 P3d 331 (2005), <em>rev den, </em>342 Or 46 (2006), an upward departure sentence based on a defendant\u2019s supervisory status \u201crequires further inferences about the malevolent quality of the offender and the failure of his [probationary] status to serve as an effective deterrent.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b114-4\">On this record, we conclude that there is no legitimate debate that the jury would have drawn the inferences required by <em>Allen. </em>Defendant admitted on the stand to having been on probation or parole for most of his life. At sentencing, the state informed the court that defendant was on probation for third-degree theft at the time he committed his current crime, and defendant did not contest that assertion. Moreover, given that defendant admitted to having 30 convictions in the 11 years before the trial in this case, the jury, as discussed above, was aware of defendant\u2019s persistent involvement in similar offenses at the time he admitted to having been on probation or parole for most of his life. Accordingly, the trial court did not err in imposing a departure sentence on defendant\u2019s conviction for first-degree burglary.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
