Wise, </em>202 Or App 661, 123 P3d 370 (2005) <em>(Wise I), </em>in light of <em>State v. Ramirez, </em>343 Or 505, 173 P3d 817 (2007), <em>adh\u2019d to as modified on recons, </em>344 Or 195, 179 P3d 673 (2008), and <em>State v. Fults, </em>343 Or 515, 173 P3d 822 (2007). <em>State v. Wise, </em>345 Or 317, 195 P3d 64 (2008). In <em>Wise I, </em>we vacated defendant\u2019s sentences and remanded for resentencing because the trial court had imposed departure sentences based on judicial findings that defendant was persistently involved in similar offenses. That factfinding constituted plain error, and we exercised our discretion to correct it. The issue before us on remand is whether, in light of <em>Ramirez </em>and <em>Fults, </em>we properly exercised our discretion under <em>Ailes v. Portland Meadows, Inc., </em>312 Or 376, 381-82, 823 P2d 956 (1991). We conclude that our exercise of discretion in <em>Wise I </em>was correct. Accordingly, we again remand for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-5\">Among other offenses, defendant was convicted of two counts of unlawful possession of a controlled substance. The trial court imposed durational departure sentences on those convictions based on defendant\u2019s \u201cpersistent involvement in similar offenses.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b282-6\">As we explained in <em>State v. Williams, </em>225 Or App 325, 328-29, 201 P3d 267 (2009), under <em>State v. Bray, </em>342 Or 711, 724, 160 P3d 983 (2007), there is no legitimate debate that a jury would have found a defendant to have been persistently involved in similar offenses where the number and frequency of the defendant\u2019s prior convictions compels the inference that his or her criminal behavior has been \u201cpersistent.\u201d <em>See Ramirez, </em>343 Or at 513 (setting out \u201clegitimate debate\u201d standard for exercise of discretion to review unpreserved challenges to departure sentences based on judicial findings of fact).</p>\n<p id=\"b282-7\">On this record, we cannot say that there is \u201cno legitimate debate\u201d that a jury would have found that defendant had been persistently involved in similar offenses. The only evidence of defendant\u2019s criminal history at sentencing was the state\u2019s representation that defendant had \u201cat least 34 convictions,\u201d including manslaughter and driving under the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>influence of intoxicants. As noted, here, the trial court imposed durational departure sentences on the two counts of unlawful possession of controlled substances. However, the state did not assert that defendant had prior convictions for unlawful possession of a controlled substance or any other offenses involving controlled substances. Accordingly, the evidence in the record before us is insufficient to compel the inference that defendant was persistently involved in similar offenses. <em>See State v. Cornelius, </em>112 Or App 98, 100-01, 827 P2d 937, <em>rev den, </em>314 Or 176 (1992) (explaining test for determining similarity of offenses for purposes of departure sentences).</p>\n<p id=\"b283-4\">Moreover, the gravity of the error in this case was not trivial. <em>Ailes, </em>312 Or at 382 n 6. The imposition of the upward departure sentences on Counts 4 and 7 increased defendant\u2019s term of incarceration by 12 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-5\">For the above reasons, we exercise our discretion to correct that error. <em>Ramirez, </em>343 Or at 513.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-6\">Remanded for resentencing; otherwise affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
