The state concedes that the trial court so erred. Specifically, the state acknowledges that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b512-5\">\u201c[t]he scope, history, and evolution of the [two] provisions demonstrate that the legislature intended to create a single crime of unlawful possession of a firearm by concealment. For merger purposes, ORS 166.250(l)(a) and (l)(b) constitute a single \u2018statutory provision\u2019 and offenses merge when, as here, a defendant violates both subsections <em>by possessing a single firearm in the same criminal episode </em>by concealing the firearm on his person while in a vehicle.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b512-6\">(Emphasis in original.)
