Schnetzky, </em>205 Or App 673, 135 P3d 359 (2006) <em>(Schnetzky I), </em>in light of <em>State v. Ramirez, </em>343 Or 505, 173 P3d 817 (2007), <em>adh\u2019d to as modified on recons, </em>344 Or 195, 179 P3d 673 (2008), and <em>State v. Fults, </em>343 Or 515, 173 P3d 822 (2007). <em>State v. Schnetzky, </em>344 Or 280, 180 P3d 702 (2008). In <em>Schnetzky I, </em>we vacated defendant\u2019s sentences and remanded for resentencing because the trial court had imposed a departure sentence based on judicial findings that defendant was persistently involved in similar offenses. That factfinding constituted plain error, and we exercised our discretion to correct it. The issue before us on remand is whether, in light of <em>Ramirez </em>and <em>Fults, </em>we properly exercised our discretion under <em>Ailes v. Portland Meadows, Inc., </em>312 Or 376, 381-82, 823 P2d 956 (1991). We conclude that our exercise of discretion in <em>Schnetzky I </em>was correct. Accordingly, we remand for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-5\">Defendant was convicted of second-degree escape, and the trial court imposed a durational departure sentence of 48 months\u2019 imprisonment. The trial court gave the following reason for its decision to depart:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b295-6\">\u201cYour record is lengthy, it takes three full pages of 19 lines, only 17 on the forms. I guess that it\u2019s just one page that\u2019s copy. It runs the gamut of one, two, three, four, five, six separate drug crimes, maybe seven. One I can\u2019t read, plus thefts, prior escape, failure to appear, to me that\u2019s persistent involvement in criminal behavior.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b295-7\">* * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b295-8\">\u201cBecause of the extent and the nature of your record and your prior failures, I do find an upward departure to be justifiable here.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b295-9\">As we explained in <em>State v. Williams, </em>225 Or App 325, 328-29, 201 P3d 267 (2009), under <em>State v. Bray, </em>342 Or 711, 724, 160 P3d 983 (2007), there is no legitimate debate that a jury would have found a defendant to have been persistently involved in similar offenses where the number and frequency of the defendant\u2019s prior convictions compels the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>inference that his or her criminal behavior has been \u201cpersistent.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b296-4\">On this record, we cannot say that there is no legitimate debate that the jury would have found defendant to have been persistently involved in similar offenses. <em>See Ramirez, </em>343 Or at 513 (setting out \u201clegitimate debate\u201d standard for exercise of discretion to review unpreserved challenges to departure sentences based on judicial findings of fact). Defendant was sentenced in this case in 2004, and at that time he had one prior conviction for escape in 1987 and one conviction for failure to appear in 1999. Defendant\u2019s criminal history, although not trivial, is not so overwhelming in terms of both the number and frequency of prior convictions for similar offenses that there exists no legitimate debate that the jury would have drawn the inference of \u201cpersistency\u201d required by <em>Bray.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b296-5\">Moreover, the gravity of the error in this case is not trivial. <em>Ailes, </em>312 Or at 382 n 6. The presumptive sentence for defendant\u2019s conviction for second-degree escape was 19 to 24 months\u2019 imprisonment; imposition of the departure sentence thus increased defendant\u2019s term of incarceration by 24 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-6\">Remanded for resentencing; otherwise affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
