On appeal, defendant challenges his convictions and his sentences. We affirm defendant\u2019s convictions without discussion and write only to address defendant\u2019s assignment of error concerning his sentences.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-5\">At sentencing, the state requested that the court impose consecutive sentences as to each of the three convictions, pursuant to ORS 137.123(5).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The trial court did so, over defendant\u2019s objection that the imposition of consecutive sentences under that statute would require the court to make \u201cfactual findings that are not made at trial, that are not pled and proved beyond a reasonable doubt[,]\u201d in violation of the principles enunciated in <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 US 466, 120 S Ct 2348, 147 L Ed 2d 435 (2000), and <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 US 296, 124 S Ct 2531, 159 L Ed 2d 403 (2004). On appeal, defendant reprises his argument that the trial court\u2019s factual findings under ORS 137.123(5) violated the rule of <em>Apprendi/Blakely. </em>In <em>Oregon v. Ice, </em>555 US_, 129 S Ct 711, 172 L Ed 2d 517 (2009), the United States Supreme Court held that the rule of <em>Apprendi/Blakely </em>does not extend to the imposition of consecutive sentences under ORS 137.123(5), and that the Sixth Amendment does not preclude judges from making certain factual determinations under that statute before imposing consecutive sentences. Accordingly, we reject defendant\u2019s assignment of error concerning his sentences.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-8\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b105-9\"> ORS 137.123(5) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b105-10\">\u201cThe court has discretion to impose consecutive terms of imprisonment for separate convictions arising out of a continuous and uninterrupted course of conduct only if the court finds:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b105-11\">\u201c(a) That the criminal offense for which a consecutive sentence is contemplated was not merely an incidental violation of a separate statutory provision in the course of the commission of a more serious crime but rather was an indication of defendant\u2019s willingness to commit more than one criminal offense; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A0b\">\u201c(b) The criminal offense for which a consecutive sentence is contemplated caused or created a risk of causing greater or qualitatively different loss, injury or harm to the victim or caused or created a risk of causing loss, injury or harm to a different victim than was caused or threatened by the other offense or offenses committed during a continuous and uninterrupted course of conduct.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
