J.</author>\n<p id=\"b181-4\">Plaintiff appeals, after a jury found in favor of defendants, plaintiffs employers, in an action that included a claim for disability discrimination under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), 42 USC sections 12101 to 12213. Plaintiff contends that the trial court erred when it instructed the jury that, even if plaintiff proved that discrimination was a \u201cmotivating factor\u201d in defendants\u2019 decision to discharge him, defendants could nevertheless prevail if they proved that they would have made the same decision even without any improper motivation \u2014 that is, that they would have fired him anyway. Plaintiff asserts, particularly, that the instruction was erroneously overbroad or incomplete because it failed to inform the jury that, even if defendants proved that they would have made the \u201csame decision anyway,\u201d that would not absolve them from <em>all </em>liability under the ADA \u2014 but, instead, would merely preclude plaintiff from recovering certain relief <em>(e.g., </em>money damages) on his ADA claim. We conclude that plaintiff failed to preserve that contention before the trial court. <em>See State v. Wyatt, </em>331 Or 335, 15 P3d 22 (2000). Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-5\">The following material circumstances are, for purposes of our review, undisputed. Beginning in January 2002, plaintiff was an employee of Versa Corporation, an Astoria-based company that sells silage bagging systems and associated equipment produced by Walluski Western Ltd., another Astoria-based corporation.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On April 6, 2004, plaintiff was involved in a serious accident outside of work that left him disabled.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Following an unpaid medical leave, plaintiff <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>returned to work until he was terminated on November 5, 2004.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-3\">Plaintiff brought this action on December 8, 2005, asserting claims for common-law wrongful discharge and violations of both the Family Medical Leave Act, 29 USC sections 2601 to 2654, and the ADA. Following several motions for partial summary judgment, only plaintiffs ADA claim remained for the jury\u2019s consideration. Plaintiff alleged that his disability was a motivating factor in defendants\u2019 decision to fire him and that any legitimate reasons for termination offered by defendants were pretextual. Defendants denied any discriminatory motive and further asserted that plaintiff was terminated \u201cdue to deficiencies with his performance that had nothing to do with his disability.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b182-4\">On the day before trial, the parties submitted proposed jury instructions to the court. At that time, plaintiff requested that the court give the following instruction, in part, regarding the causation element of plaintiffs ADA claim:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b182-5\">\u201cTo establish a claim of disability discrimination under the ADA based upon protected class status, the plaintiff must prove the following elements by a preponderance of the evidence:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b182-6\">******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b182-7\">\u201c3. <em>the plaintiffs disability was a motivating factor in the decision to fire the plaintiff. It is not necessary for the plaintiff to prove that the plaintiffs disability was the sole or exclusive reason for the defendant\u2019s decision.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b182-8\">(Emphasis added.) The proposed instruction cited, as supporting authority, Ninth Circuit Model Civil Jury Instruction 15.2 (2001), and the requested language paralleled that of the model instruction.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b183-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>Defendants\u2019 proposed jury instruction on causation was not dissimilar from plaintiffs requested instruction. It stated that plaintiff was required to prove:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b183-4\">\u201c3. That Plaintiffs request for reasonable accommodation of his disability was a motivating factor in the adverse employment action taken by Defendants!.]\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b183-5\">However, unlike plaintiffs proposed instruction, defendants\u2019 instruction did not include the statement that plaintiff need not show that his disability was the \u201csole or exclusive\u201d factor in the defendants\u2019 decision to discharge. Neither of the proposed instructions on causation referred to the \u201csame decision anyway\u201d defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-6\">On the eve of trial, plaintiff and defendants also submitted trial memoranda, briefing the court on their respective positions as to the legal standards applicable to plaintiffs ADA claim and evidence to be presented at trial. Neither trial memorandum addressed the applicability and potential scope of the \u201csame decision anyway\u201d defense in this action.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-7\">Ultimately the trial court did not give either plaintiffs or defendants\u2019 requested jury instruction on the causation element of an ADA claim. Instead, the court crafted and gave the following instruction:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b183-8\">\u201cIn order to establish a claim under the ADA, the Plaintiff must prove the following elements by a preponderance of the evidence: * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b183-9\">\u2021 iji i}&lt; <em>%</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b183-10\"><em>\u201c* </em>* * [T]hird, the Plaintiffs disability was a motivating factor in the Defendants\u2019 decision to fire Plaintiff.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b183-11\">\u201cIf you find Plaintiff has established the third element by a preponderance of the evidence, your verdict should be for Plaintiff. <em>If on the other hand you find Plaintiff has failed to establish his disability was a motivating factor in his termination from employment by a preponderance of the evidence, or Defendants have established by a preponderance of the evidence that the Defendants would have made the same decision even if Plaintiff s disability was a motivating factor in Defendants\u2019 decision to discharge Plaintiff, then your verdict should be for the Defendants.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b184-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>(Emphasis added.) Although it is not clear from the record, it appears that the trial court may have drawn the language for that instruction from an updated and revised version of the Ninth Circuit Model Civil Jury Instructions that was published during the trial.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b184-4\">The jury returned a defense verdict based on the following special verdict responses:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b184-5\">\u201cQUESTION 1:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b184-6\">\u201cDid defendants terminate plaintiffs employment because of a disability?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b184-7\">\u201cANSWER: _ Yes X No</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b184-8\">\u201cQUESTION 2:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b184-9\">\u201cDid defendants terminate plaintiffs employment because plaintiff requested reasonable accommodation of his disability?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b184-10\">\u201cANSWER: _ Yes X No</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b184-11\">\u201cIf you answered \u2018No\u2019 to questions 1 and <em>2, </em>stop here. Your verdict is for the defendants.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b184-12\">(Boldface in original.) The trial court entered a general judgment in favor of defendants, consistent with the jury\u2019s verdict, on May 16, 2007.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>On appeal, plaintiff seeks reversal of the judgment and a remand for a new trial, assigning error to the last sentence of the court\u2019s instruction on causation under the ADA. Again, that portion of the instruction reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b185-4\">\u201cIf on the other hand you find Plaintiff has failed to establish his disability was a motivating factor in his termination from employment by a preponderance of the evidence, or Defendants have established by a preponderance of the evidence that the Defendants would have made the same decision even if Plaintiff s disability was a motivating factor in Defendants\u2019 decision to discharge Plaintiff, then your verdict should be for the Defendants.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b185-5\">Specifically, plaintiff asserts that the trial court erred by instructing the jury that, even if plaintiff successfully established that his disability was a motivating factor in defendants\u2019 termination decision, defendants could avoid <em>all liability </em>by showing that they would have fired plaintiff anyway. According to plaintiff, \u201c[t]he \u2018same decision anyway\u2019 analysis is an affirmative defense to certain types of liability <em>[viz., </em>for damages] rather than a complete bar\u201d to <em>all </em>liability under the ADA, including with respect to declaratory relief and attorney fees. As support for that proposition, plaintiff invokes several Ninth Circuit cases, including <em>Head v. Glacier Northwest, Inc., </em>413 F3d 1053 (9th Cir 2005).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b185-6\">Defendants respond that the \u201csame decision anyway\u201d defense is a complete bar to liability under the ADA, citing, <em>inter alia, Price Waterhouse v. Hopkins, </em>490 US 228, 109 S Ct 1775, 104 L Ed 2d 268 (1989).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In the alternative, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>defendants assert that, even if plaintiff is correct that \u201csame decision anyway\u201d is an affirmative defense only with respect to the recovery of monetary damages \u2014 and not to ADA liability more generally \u2014 the instruction was \u201ccorrect, or at most harmless error\u201d because \u201c[t]he only claims submitted to the jury in this case were claims under the ADA for monetary damages.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b186-4\">In sum, the parties agree that the instruction given was correct, <em>at least as to damages. </em>Thus, the gravamen of plaintiffs argument is not so much that the instruction was an erroneous statement of law \u2014 at least as to the jury\u2019s determination of whether plaintiff was entitled to recover damages \u2014 but, instead, that the instruction was impermissibly overbroad and implicitly misleading because it did not inform the jury that (at least under plaintiffs view of the law) the \u201csame decision anyway\u201d defense did not preclude all liability under the ADA.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-5\">Defendants do not assert that the assigned error was not preserved for our review. However, we are enjoined, as a prudential matter, to determine independently whether plaintiff adequately raised and preserved his present contention before the trial court. <em>Wyatt, </em>331 Or at 344-46; <em>see also State v. Rumler, </em>199 Or App 32, 39, 110 P3d 115 (2005). For the reasons that follow, we decline to address plaintiffs present challenge to the trial court\u2019s causation instruction as unpreserved. <footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b187-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number> ORCP 59 H prescribes what a party must do in the trial court to preserve instructional error:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b187-4\">\u201cH(l) A party may not obtain review on appeal of an asserted error by a trial court in submitting or refusing to submit a statement of issues to a jury pursuant to subsection C(2) of this rule or in giving or refusing to give an instruction to a jury <em>unless the party who seeks to appeal identified the asserted error to the trial court </em>and made a notation of exception immediately after the court instructed the jury.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b187-5\">\u201cH(2) A party shall state <em>with particularity </em>any point of exception to the trial judge. A party shall make a notation of exception either orally on the record or in a writing filed with the court.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b187-6\">(Emphasis added.) <em>See generally Peitsch v. Keizer, </em>219 Or App 114, 116, 180 P3d 1239 (2008) (concluding that challenge to jury instruction did not comport with ORCP 59 H and, thus, was not preserved for appellate review: \u201c[T]he exception that plaintiffs\u2019 counsel did raise * * * did not cogently present for the trial court\u2019s consideration the alleged deficiencies in that instruction that plaintiffs urge on appeal.\u201d). Thus, the requirements of ORCP 59 H are congruent with the more general directive that a party \u201cmust provide the trial court with an explanation of his or her objection that is specific enough to ensure that the court can identify its alleged error with enough clarity to permit it to consider and correct the error immediately, if correction is warranted.\u201d <em>Wyatt, </em>331 Or at 343; <em>see also State v. Wideman, </em>203 Or App 359, 364, 124 P3d 1271 (2005) (preservation rules are meant to ensure \u201cthat the position of a party is presented clearly to the trial court and that parties are not taken by surprise, misled, or denied opportunities to meet an argument\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b187-7\">In this case, plaintiffs exception at the time of trial did not alert the trial court to the alleged defect in the causation instruction that plaintiff urges on appeal. Immediately after having instructed the jury, the trial court invited counsel to state their exceptions to the instructions. Plaintiffs counsel then recited a list of the instructions to which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>she was taking exception, which included \u2014 without elaboration \u2014 the instruction on \u201celements to establish ADA claim.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Although that exception informed the trial court that plaintiff took issue with some aspect of the causation instruction, it did not \u201cstate with particularity,\u201d ORCP 59 H(2), any objection to that instruction. Much less did that exception \u201ccogently present for the trial court\u2019s consideration the alleged deficiencies in that instruction that plaintiff! ] urge[s] on appeal.\u201d <em>Peitsch, </em>219 Or App at 116. That is, that exception did not alert the trial court to the presently \u201calleged error with enough clarity to permit it to consider and correct the error immediately, if correction is warranted.\u201d <em>Wyatt, </em>331 Or at 343.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-4\">Later in the colloquy pertaining to exceptions, plaintiffs attorney listed exceptions to the trial court\u2019s <em>failure </em>to give <em>requested </em>instructions. <em>See </em>ORCP 59 H(l) (party must except to \u201can asserted error * * * in giving <em>or refusing to give </em>an instruction\u201d (emphasis added)).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> In that context, plaintiffs attorney stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b188-5\">\u201cI want to put on the record our objection to the failure to give Plaintiffs Requested Jury Instruction No. 18 because the only requirement under the ADA is that the Plaintiff establish that there was \u2014 that a discriminatory motive was a motivating factor, and that should be enough to establish liability and <em>but for test is not applicable.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b188-6\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b188-7\">Once again, even if that statement could somehow be cast as \u201camplifying context\u201d for plaintiffs earlier objection <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>to the court\u2019s causation instruction, that remark was inadequate to alert the trial court to the contention that plaintiff now raises on appeal. In particular, counsel\u2019s unadorned statement that the \u201cbut for test is not applicable\u201d was insufficient to raise, and preserve, plaintiffs present challenge.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-4\">The phrase \u201cbut for test\u201d in the ADA context appears to refer to a requirement that a discrimination plaintiff prove that \u201cbut for\u201d his or her disability, the adverse employment action would not have occurred.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> A requirement of \u201cbut for\u201d causation is generally considered tantamount to requiring a plaintiff to prove that disability was the \u201csole or exclusive\u201d reason for the adverse employment action. <em>See Price Waterhouse, </em>490 US at 240-41 (discussing \u201cbut for\u201d causation under Title VII). Thus, plaintiffs attorney\u2019s reference to the \u201cbut for\u201d test did not give the trial court the opportunity to consider the issue now raised on <em>appeal </em>\u2014 viz., whether proof of \u201csame decision anyway\u201d bars liability or just limits the prevailing party\u2019s recovery to equitable relief.* <footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Further, even if <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>counsel\u2019s reference to the \u201cbut for\u201d test could somehow be understood to refer to the \u201csame decision anyway\u201d defense, the unqualified statement that that concept is \u201cnot applicable\u201d is wrong. Even under plaintiffs position on appeal, the \u201csame decision anyway\u201d defense is applicable, albeit only as a bar to damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-4\">We note, finally, that plaintiff did not object to the content of the special verdict. That inaction is, at least collaterally, significant and revealing with respect to nonpreservation in two related respects. First, as noted, plaintiffs present challenge to the causation instruction proceeds from the premise that, if he proved that his disability was a motivating factor for his discharge, he would be the prevailing party in the action, entitled, at least, to declaratory relief and attorney fees, even if defendants established the \u201csame decision anyway\u201d defense \u2014 and, thus, the instruction overstated the effect of that defense. Given that premise, one would reasonably have expected plaintiff to insist on special interrogatories that tracked that reasoning, separately inquiring as to whether (1) plaintiffs disability was a motivating factor in his discharge and (2) whether, even if so, defendants would have discharged defendant anyway, on other, nondiscriminatory grounds. Further, for the same reasons, one would reasonably have expected plaintiff to have objected to a more general interrogatory that, as a practical matter, encompassed both inquiries without differentiation. However, the special verdict form did not differentiate between those inquiries \u2014 instead, merely asking, \u201cDid defendants terminate plaintiffs employment because of a disability?\u201d \u2014 and plaintiff did not object. Second, and concomitantly, if plaintiff had so objected, that might well have contextually alerted the trial court to his present challenge to the causation instruction. But, again, that did not occur.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-5\">We thus decline to review, as unpreserved, plaintiffs challenge to the trial court\u2019s instruction regarding causation on plaintiffs ADA claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b181-6\"> Defendants denied throughout the litigation that plaintiff was ever employed by Walluski Western Ltd.

However, the advisory comment further provides that \u201c[t]he Ninth Circuit has not explicitly decided whether the \u2018same decision\u2019 affirmative defense is an absolute bar to a plaintiffs recovery in the ADA context\u201d and goes on to suggest that, if the trial court determines the evidence supports the defense, it should instruct the jury as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b184-14\">\u201cIf you find that the plaintiff has failed to prove any of these elements, your verdict should be for the defendant. If, on the other hand, the plaintiff has proved all of these elements, the plaintiff is entitled to your verdict, even if you find that the defendant\u2019s decision was motivated by the plaintiffs disability and a lawful reason. <em>If, however, the defendant proves by a preponderance of the evidence that the defendant would have made the same decision even if the plaintiffs disability had played no role in the defendants decision to [[discharge] </em>* * <em>*] the plaintiff, your verdict should be for the defendant.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b184-15\">Comment to Ninth Circuit Model Civil Jury Instruction 12.1C (brackets in original; emphasis added).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b185-7\"> Relying on <em>Head, </em>plaintiff asserts that an ADA plaintiff is entitled to the same remedies as a plaintiff who brings a race or sex discrimination claim under Title VII because the ADA specifically incorporates certain \u201cpowers, remedies, and procedures\u201d of Title VII. 42 USC \u00a7 12117. Under the 1991 amendments to Title VII, when a plaintiff proves that discrimination was a motivating factor but the defendant proves that it would have taken the same action in the absence of discrimination, the plaintiff is still entitled to declaratory and limited injunctive relief, and attorney\u2019s fees and costs. 42 USC \u00a7 2000e-5(g)(2)(B).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b185-8\"> In <em>Price Waterhouse, </em>a plurality of the Supreme Court interpreted Title VII to require that a plaintiff prove only that discrimination was a \u201cmotivating factor\u201d for the adverse employment action, not the \u201cbut for\u201d cause of the employer\u2019s action. 490 US at 258.

The Ninth Circuit has rejected the \u2018but for\u201d test in the ADA context, requiring an ADA plaintiff to prove only that discrimination based on the plaintiff\u2019s disability was a \u201cmotivating factor.\u201d Head, 413 F3d at 1063-65.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b189-6\"> On appeal, plaintiff seems to conflate the two distinct legal principles of\u2018but for\u201d causation and the \u201csame decision anyway\u201d defense, sometimes using the two terms interchangeably. With respect to \u2018but for\u201d causation, the parties and the trial court appear to have been in agreement that the ADA does not require a plaintiff to demonstrate that \u201cbut for\u201d his or her disability, the adverse employment action would not have been taken. In fact, the trial court\u2019s instructions to the jury specifically provided that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b189-7\">\u201cMany factors may operate either independently or together to cause an employer\u2019s action. In such a case, each may be the cause of the employer\u2019s decision, even though the others would have been * * * sufficient of themselves to cause the same decision.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b189-8\">\u201cThe Plaintiff does not need to show that his protected class or conduct was the sole factor, the dominant factor, or the primary factor in the employer\u2019s action.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b189-9\">However, the effect of the \u201csame decision anyway\u201d defense is different. It does not require the <em>plaintiff </em>to prove \u201cbut for\u201d causation as part of his or her <em>prima facie </em>case; rather, it functions as an <em>affirmative defense </em>so that, even if a jury finds that discrimination was a motivating factor, a defendant can avoid responsibility (at least as to damages \u2014 and, arguably, as to liability in general) by showing that it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>had an independently nonactionable reason for the challenged action. Thus, the \u201csame decision anyway\u201d defense is, to some extent, the obverse of the \u201cbut for\u201d test, with the defendant, not the plaintiff, bearing the burden of persuasion.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
