Muniz, </em>204 Or App 469,130 P3d 789 (2006) <em>(Muniz I), </em>in light <em>of State v. Ramirez, </em>343 Or 505, 173 P3d 817 (2007), <em>adh\u2019d to as modified on recons, </em>344 Or 195, 179 P3d 673 (2008), and <em>State v. Fults, </em>343 Or 515, 173 P3d 822 (2007). <em>State v. Muniz, </em>345 Or 316, 195 P3d 63 (2008). In <em>Muniz I, </em>we vacated defendant\u2019s sentences and remanded for resentencing because the trial court had imposed departure sentences based on judicial findings that defendant was persistently involved in similar offenses. That factfinding constituted plain error, and we exercised our discretion to correct it. The issue before us on remand is whether, in light of <em>Ramirez </em>and <em>Fults, </em>we properly exercised our discretion under <em>Ailes v. Portland Meadows, Inc., </em>312 Or 376, 381-82, 823 P2d 956 (1991). We conclude that our exercise of discretion in <em>Muniz I </em>was correct. Accordingly, we remand for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-5\">Defendant was convicted of, among other offenses, second-degree escape for breaking out of a juvenile correctional facility. The trial court imposed a durational departure sentence of 18 months\u2019 imprisonment based on its finding of \u201cpersistent involvement in similar offenses \u2014 runaways and escapes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b268-6\">As we explained in <em>State v. Williams, </em>225 Or App 325, 328-29, 201 P3d 267 (2009), under <em>State v. Bray, </em>342 Or 711, 724, 160 P3d 983 (2007), there is no legitimate debate that a jury would have found a defendant to have been persistently involved in similar offenses where the number and frequency of the defendant\u2019s prior convictions compels the inference that his or her criminal behavior has been \u201cpersistent.\u201d <em>See Ramirez, </em>343 Or at 513 (setting out \u201clegitimate debate\u201d standard for exercise of discretion to review unpreserved challenges to departure sentences based on judicial findings of fact).</p>\n<p id=\"b268-7\">At sentencing, the trial court heard testimony from defendant\u2019s juvenile probation officer, who related several instances of defendant running away from juvenile detention facilities. When asked if any of those instances had been charged or had resulted in a conviction for escape, the officer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>answered, \u201c[N]o.\u201d Both the state and the trial court, as is apparent from the sentencing colloquy, were aware that defendant had no prior convictions for escape. Nonetheless, the state argued, and the trial court agreed, that defendant\u2019s prior uncharged conduct qualified him for a departure sentence based on persistent involvement in similar offenses. As <em>Bray </em>makes clear, however, a departure based on persistent involvement is predicated on drawing an inference about the defendant from the existence of two or more <em>prior convictions. </em>Because defendant lacked the requisite prior convictions for similar offenses, it is debatable that a jury would or properly could find that factor.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-4\">Remanded for resentencing; otherwise affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
