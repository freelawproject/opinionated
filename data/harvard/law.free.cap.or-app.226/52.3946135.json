J.</author>\n<p id=\"b78-4\">After a jury trial in 2006, defendant was convicted of nine sex offenses committed in 1995, when defendant was 17 years old and the victim was seven or eight years old. After the jury rendered its verdict, the trial court dismissed the jury and sentenced defendant to concurrent and consecutive sentences totaling 175 months in prison based on its own findings. Defendant appeals, raising two assignments of error: (1) that there was insufficient evidence for a jury to find beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant\u2019s crimes were committed on or after the effective date for Measure 11 sentencing for the relevant offenses, <em>viz., </em>April 1, 1995; and (2) that the trial court erred by imposing consecutive sentences based on facts not found by a jury beyond a reasonable doubt or admitted by him. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-5\">The relevant facts are not in dispute. Defendant was indicted on six counts of sodomy in the first degree, ORS 163.405, and three counts of sexual abuse in the first degree, ORS 163.427. The indictment alleged that each count occurred \u201con or between May 01, 1995 and July 31, 1995.\u201d The verdict form for each count included a special instruction that stated that, for each count that the jury found defendant guilty, the jury had to answer the following question: \u201cDid the crime occur on or after April 01, 1995?\u201d The jury found defendant guilty on all counts and affirmatively answered the special question confirming that at least 10 of the 12 jurors who found defendant guilty on each count also believed beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant had committed the crimes on or after April 1,1995.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-6\">At defendant\u2019s sentencing hearing, the trial court stated that it had considered the number of offenses that had occurred; the harm that defendant had perpetrated on the victim, the victim\u2019s family, and defendant\u2019s family; and the fact that defendant \u201cappear[ed] to be low risk to re-offend[,]\u201d because there was no indication that defendant had been involved in criminal conduct either before or after the instant crimes. On Counts 1 through 6, sodomy in the first degree, the court sentenced defendant to 100 months in prison on each count, to be served concurrently. On Counts 7 through 9, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>sexual abuse in the first degree, the court sentenced defendant to 75 months in prison on each count, to be served concurrently with each other but consecutively to the 100-month concurrent sentences on Counts 1 through 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-4\">In defendant\u2019s first assignment of error, he asserts that \u201c[t]he trial court erred by denying defendant\u2019s motion challenging the sufficiency of the evidence regarding the date of the alleged incidents.\u201d Defendant argues that, while the dates of a crime are not typically a material element, the dates are relevant here because they implicate the sentencing scheme that applies to defendant. That is, defendant\u2019s convictions would be Measure 11 crimes and necessarily involve mandatory minimum sentences only <em>if </em>defendant committed those crimes on or after April 1, 1995. <em>See </em>ORS 137.700 (setting out Measure 11 sentencing scheme). Defendant points to the victim\u2019s testimony that the incidents all occurred in \u201cspring 1995,\u201d that the parties at trial stipulated to the fact that the first day of spring 1995 was March 21, 1995, and that \u201cthere was no testimony as to the exact dates, or the timeframe\u201d that would \u201chelp a trier of fact determine when the events actually occurred.\u201d Based on the foregoing facts, defendant argues that there was insufficient evidence for a rational factfinder to find beyond a reasonable doubt that all of the offenses were committed on or after April 1, 1995.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-5\">We view the evidence in the light most favorable to the state to determine whether a rational factfinder, making reasonable inferences, <em>could </em>have found the essential elements of the crime proved beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>State v. Hall, </em>327 Or 568, 570, 966 P2d 208 (1998). As a reviewing court, we must decide not whether we believe the defendant is guilty beyond a reasonable doubt, but whether there was sufficient evidence to support a jury\u2019s finding of guilt. <em>Id. </em>When analyzing the sufficiency of the evidence, we make no distinction between direct and circumstantial evidence as to the degree of proof required. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b79-6\">Given the evidence in the record, defendant\u2019s argument is not well taken. At trial, the victim testified that the offenses occurred while the victim was playing Little League baseball. The state presented evidence that the victim\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>team\u2019s first game was played on April 22,1995. In light of our standard of review, we cannot say that a rational factfinder, making reasonable inferences, could not have found that defendant committed the charged offenses on or after April 1, 1995. In light of the evidence at trial, it was not error for the trial court to deny defendant\u2019s motion challenging the sufficiency of the evidence regarding the dates of the offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-4\">Defendant\u2019s second assignment of error is unpreserved below. Defendant, however, argues that we nevertheless should review the error because it was error apparent on the face of the record for the trial court to impose consecutive sentences based on its own factfinding and not that of a jury. Defendant\u2019s argument is foreclosed by <em>Oregon v. Ice, </em>555 US _, 129 S Ct 711, 172 L Ed 2d 517 (2009), in which the United States Supreme Court rejected that same contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-7\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
