However, because the board concluded that it lacked the authority to release petitioner until he had completed serving the 30-year minimum sentence imposed by the sentencing court under ORS 163.105 (1985), it set a projected parole release date of May 2015. On review, petitioner initially argues that \u201c[t]he board erred when it found that it lacked the authority to override the 30-year judicial minimum sentence.\u201d Petitioner\u2019s assignment of error is controlled by our reasoning and the legislative history discussed in <em>Fleming v. Board of Parole, </em>225 Or App 578, 202 P3d 209 (2009), and, for the reasons set forth in <em>Fleming, </em>we reverse and remand this case so that the board may reevaluate which, if any, of its authorizing statutes may properly be applied to petitioner\u2019s circumstances, in light of our interpretation of ORS 163.105 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b107-5\">Petitioner also argues that, after he became eligible for parole under ORS 163.105 (1985), the board\u2019s rules required it to set a parole release date within petitioner\u2019s matrix range of 120 to 168 months. Because petitioner has served more than 168 months, he contends that he is entitled to immediate release on parole. We conclude that that issue must be addressed on remand once the board determines which, if any, of its authorizing statutes are applicable to petitioner\u2019s circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-6\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b107-7\"> In 1984, Oregon voters amended ORS 163.105 (1983) through Ballot Measure 7, which became effective on December 6,1984.
