Petitioner argues that it should have been relieved of the charges because its franchisees are not petitioner\u2019s \u201cemployees\u201d for purposes of ORS chapter 657. Petitioner submits that \u201cthis Court already is considering whether [petitioner\u2019s] franchisees are employees in another pending case [involving the same parties], (A134773)\u201d and \u201cthe result in this case should follow this Court\u2019s decision in that matter.\u201d In <em>Employment Dept. v. National Maintenance Contractors, </em>226 Or App 473, 204 P3d 151 (2009), we concluded that petitioner\u2019s franchisees provided services to petitioner for remuneration and were therefore within the legislature\u2019s definition of employment in ORS 657.030. For that reason, we remanded the order for the administrative law judge to consider whether the franchisees were independent contractors. <em>Id. </em>at 492.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-5\">Given our remand in case A134773, petitioner is not, at this time, entitled to relief of unemployment insurance charges. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
