ORS 163.427. His sole assignment of error on appeal is that the trial court erred in denying his motion, made pursuant to OEC 412, to allow evidence of the victim\u2019s prior allegations of sexual abuse by others.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-5\">We take the following facts from the record. Defendant was a friend of the 10-year-old victim\u2019s grandfather. Because the grandfather\u2019s driving privileges had been suspended, he depended on defendant for transportation. One day in the summer of 2004, the victim rode with defendant and her grandfather to the bank. The victim sat in the middle of the vehicle\u2019s front seat, between the two men. The victim alleged that, while her grandfather was in the bank, defendant placed his hand over her clothed vaginal area and rubbed her vagina. She further alleged that defendant placed her hand on his penis and invited her to squeeze it.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-6\">In May 2005, after the victim disclosed the incident to her mother, she was evaluated at CARES Northwest in Portland. Reilly, a pediatric nurse practitioner, conducted a physical examination of the victim that, not surprisingly, did not disclose any physical evidence of abuse. Reilly also observed another staff member\u2019s interview of the victim from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>behind a one-way mirror. Reilly diagnosed the victim as having been sexually abused.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-4\">Defendant was charged with two counts of first-degree sexual abuse. Before trial, he moved for the admission of evidence pertaining to three prior allegations of sexual abuse made by the victim: evidence of the then-two-year-old victim\u2019s 1997 allegation of inappropriate touching by a man who lived in her household; evidence pertaining to a CARES Northwest evaluation of the victim in 2001, when she was nearly six years old, based on possible sexual abuse by an adult male family friend; and evidence pertaining to a 2003 evaluation of possible sexual abuse by another adult male family friend. As pertinent here, defendant contended that the evidence was admissible under OEC 412(2)(b)(B) to rebut or explain Reilly\u2019s diagnosis of sexual abuse by defendant. Specifically, defendant contended that Reilly\u2019s diagnosis constituted medical evidence; that, in the absence of any physical evidence of abuse, the diagnosis was based entirely on the victim\u2019s history; and that, accordingly, he was entitled to question Reilly regarding the significance of the victim\u2019s prior allegations of abuse.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-5\">At the hearing on defendant\u2019s motion, Reilly testified that the CARES evaluation of the victim consisted of a full physical examination plus the victim\u2019s history as provided by the victim\u2019s mother and by the victim during her physical examination and the interview. During the evaluation, Reilly learned that there were \u201cother individuals who may or may not have molested\u201d the victim. Reilly testified that her diagnosis that the victim had been sexually abused by defendant did not \u201cdepend\u201d on the information about other possible incidents of abuse. She also testified, however, that \u201cyou want to rule out all other possible explanations for why the child is saying what she\u2019s saying\u201d; that \u201ccertainly you always look at past experiences of abuse, and differentiating those from current concerns is taken into the evaluation process\u201d; that anything the victim previously had said and any history that a parent disclosed would be factors in the diagnosis; and that it was \u201cimportant\u201d to \u201cknow what may have occurred to someone in the past\u201d and to \u201cknow the details of a previous report.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b227-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>On cross-examination, Reilly testified that, when CARES evaluates children for sexual abuse, it uses a \u201cclassic diagnostic process\u201d that is not different from other types of medical diagnosis. She testified that patient history is \u201cvery important\u201d in a medical evaluation \u201c[s]o that you can understand and interpret the signs and symptoms and arrive at a diagnosis and treatment recommendation.\u201d Reilly also testified that, although it is \u201cimportant to know about\u201d prior allegations, it is not the purpose of a CARES evaluation to reinvestigate those events.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-4\">Reilly testified that, in this case, she based her diagnosis of sexual abuse on a combination of the victim\u2019s history and the absence of physical findings.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> When counsel asked Reilly whether she had read or relied in part on the three prior evaluations of the victim for sexual abuse, Reilly responded that she had seen only one of the evaluations \u2014 the report that had been prepared when the victim alleged abuse by a family friend in 2001.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> When asked whether the existence of prior allegations of sexual abuse that had not been either proved or disproved was \u201ca concern\u201d in the context of making the current diagnosis, she responded that \u201cthose types of considerations are taken into \u2014 are put into the diagnostic process.\u201d When asked whether, by not having seen two of the prior reports, she was lacking information that might be \u201csignificant\u201d to the current diagnosis, Reilly responded, \u201cMm-hmm\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b227-5\">Later, on cross-examination, Reilly clarified that she had learned of \u201cprior DHS concerns\u201d relating to the victim\u2014 that is, the existence of prior allegations of abuse \u2014 from the victim, the victim\u2019s mother, and the police. Reilly testified that, during the victim\u2019s interview at CARES in this case, the victim had stated that \u201cKyle\u201d had put a blanket over her face and touched her \u201cfront and back privates\u201d with his hand, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>that \u201cRob\u201d had \u201ctouch[ed] her in wrong places.\u201d Reilly testified that she was able to distinguish those events from the victim\u2019s current allegations against defendant because, although they were similar in regard to the nature of the touching, they were \u201cdifferent in the individuals who were involved.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b228-4\">On redirect, Reilly agreed that she was \u201cnot here to speculate\u201d whether the victim\u2019s previous reports were false. She reiterated that she had read the 2001 evaluation of alleged abuse and that she had \u201cconfidence\u201d that the report \u201calert[ed]\u201d her to make sure that the victim was not \u201cblurring or blending\u201d that incident and the current incident in her mind.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-5\">At the conclusion of Reilly\u2019s hearing testimony, the state argued that, even if the evidence sought by defendant was relevant to rebut medical evidence, the court should exclude it as unduly prejudicial. Defendant reiterated that, because Reilly had clearly testified that she had based her diagnosis on the victim\u2019s history, he was entitled to cross-examine Reilly about her awareness and consideration of the victim\u2019s previous allegations as part of that history. Without stating the basis for its ruling, the trial court denied defendant\u2019s motion.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b228-6\">At trial, Reilly testified that she specialized in child abuse assessment and that sexual abuse has been a recognized medical diagnosis since at least the early 1980s. Reilly testified that the protocol for making such a diagnosis includes a medical examination and an interview. She testified that the victim in this case was brought to CARES Northwest by her mother, who gave Reilly information about the victim; in addition, Reilly reviewed police reports in the case. Reilly testified that she then conducted a physical examination of the victim, which included talking to the victim about why she was at CARES; according to Reilly\u2019s testimony, the victim told her that defendant had \u201cshowed me what his private looked like and he touched my private. He made me touch his private.\u201d After concluding her physical <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>examination of the victim \u2014 which, as previously noted, disclosed no abnormalities \u2014 Reilly watched another staff member\u2019s interview of the victim through a one-way mirror. Reilly testified that she based her diagnosis that the victim had been sexually abused on the victim\u2019s history, on her physical examination of the victim, and on laboratory testing \u2014 here, a negative test for sexually transmitted diseases. Reilly was not questioned about, and provided no testimony regarding, either the existence or the significance of the victim\u2019s previous allegations of sexual touching by other persons.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-4\">As noted, defendant was convicted of two counts of first-degree sexual abuse. On appeal, as he did below, he argues that the requested evidence was admissible to rebut or explain medical evidence \u2014 Reilly\u2019s diagnosis of sexual abuse \u2014 by casting doubt on Reilly\u2019s methodology, thoroughness, and competence. Defendant contends that Reilly\u2019s diagnosis of sexual abuse was based primarily, if not entirely, on what the victim and others told Reilly of the victim\u2019s history and that, because Reilly was either unfamiliar with or discounted certain aspects of that history, he was entitled to present evidence of that circumstance to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-5\">In determining the admissibility of evidence under OEC 412, the trial court conducts a three-step inquiry. <em>State v. Muyingo, </em>171 Or App 218, 224, 15 P3d 83 (2000), <em>rev den, </em>332 Or 431 (2001). If the evidence concerns the victim\u2019s past sexual behavior, but is offered in the form of opinion or reputation evidence, the court must deny admission. <em>Id. </em>If it is offered in some other form, the trial court then determines whether the evidence qualifies for admission under one of the exceptions in OEC 412(2)(b); if it does not, again, the trial court must deny admission. <em>Id. </em>Finally, if the evidence fits within an exception, the court must balance the probative value of the evidence against its prejudicial effect. <em>Id.; see also State v. Lajoie, </em>316 Or 63, 69, 849 P2d 479 (1993) (the purpose of the rule is to encourage victims to report sexual crimes and to assist in the prosecution of their attackers); <em>State v. Beden, </em>162 Or App 178, 187, 986 P2d 94 (1999) (OEC 412 is intended to protect against \u201cunfair prejudice\u201d by protecting victims of sexual crimes from the \u201cdegrading and embarrassing disclosure of intimate details about their private lives that might provide an improper basis for a juror to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>weigh the credibility of a victim-witness or for making a decision in the case.\u201d (Quoting Legislative Commentary to Rule 412, <em>reprinted in </em>Laird C. Kirkpatrick, <em>Oregon Evidence </em>202 (2d ed 1989))). We review the trial court\u2019s ruling on the latter issue for an abuse of discretion. <em>State v. Wattenbarger, </em>97 Or App 414, 418, 776 P2d 1292, <em>rev den, </em>308 Or 331 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b230-4\">The parties do not dispute that the challenged evidence constitutes evidence, not offered in the form of reputation or opinion evidence, of the victim\u2019s past sexual behavior. <em>See Muyingo, </em>171 Or App at 222-24 (evidence of the victim\u2019s history \u2014 that she previously was allegedly raped by males other than the defendant \u2014 was evidence of the victim\u2019s past sexual behavior). We therefore turn to whether the evidence was admissible under the exception for evidence offered to rebut or explain scientific or medical evidence. OEC 412(2)(b)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b230-5\">As an initial matter, we agree with defendant that a diagnosis of sexual abuse is scientific or medical evidence for the purpose of OEC 412(2)(b)(B). <em>Cf. State v. Sanchez-Cruz, </em>177 Or App 332, 337-41, 33 P3d 1037 (2001), <em>rev den, </em>333 Or 463 (2002) (a diagnosis of sexual abuse is scientific evidence subject to the foundational requirements for such evidence). <em>State v. Nab, </em>245 Or 454, 421 P2d 388 (1967), and <em>State v. Wright, </em>97 Or App 401, 776 P2d 1294, <em>rev den, </em>308 Or 593 (1989), relied on by the state, are not to the contrary. <em>Nab, </em>a pre-OEC 412 case, involved an unrelated issue regarding the propriety of cross-examination regarding the victim\u2019s previous accusations of sexual conduct. 245 Or at 455-57. In <em>Wright, </em>this court determined that evidence that the victim was aware of sexual matters only because the defendant had abused her was not medical evidence for the purpose of OEC 412(2)(b)(B). 97 Or App at 407.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-6\">Nor is it significant, as urged by the state, that Reilly\u2019s diagnosis was not based on physical evidence of abuse, the context in which this court determined that evidence of the victim\u2019s past allegations of sexual abuse was admissible in <em>Muyingo. </em>171 Or App at 221-23, 225. Reilly herself testified that a diagnosis of sexual abuse properly can be based on other factors, including the victim\u2019s history. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>Accordingly, as in <em>Muyingo, </em>defendant generally was entitled, under OEC 412(2)(b)(B), to present evidence to rebut or explain that diagnosis.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-4\">In addition, the specific evidence at issue in this case was relevant for that purpose. As discussed above, in Reilly\u2019s testimony in the OEC 412 hearing, she repeatedly asserted the importance of patient history in the diagnostic process. Specifically, Reilly testified that \u201ccertainly you always look at past experiences of abuse,\u201d that it was \u201cimportant\u201d to \u201cknow what may have occurred to someone in the past\u201d and to \u201cknow the details of a previous report\u201d of sexual abuse, and that it was important to \u201cdifferentiat[e]\u201d past experiences from the current incident. Reilly testified that the one report she saw, relating to the victim\u2019s 2001 allegation, \u201calert[ed]\u201d her to make sure that the victim was not \u201cblurring or blending\u201d that incident and the current incident in her mind. Finally, Reilly agreed that not having seen the reports of the victim\u2019s other allegations of sexual abuse meant that she had lacked information that might have been \u201csignificant\u201d to her diagnosis. By the logic of Reilly\u2019s own testimony, the victim\u2019s previous allegations of sexual abuse had considerable relevance to the issue whether Reilly had correctly diagnosed the victim as having been sexually abused by defendant. Particularly in this case, where the absence of any physical or laboratory evidence meant that Reilly ultimately based her diagnosis of sexual abuse almost entirely on the victim\u2019s history, evidence of Reilly\u2019s inability or failure to consider the victim\u2019s previous allegations of sexual abuse was \u201cnecessary to rebut or explain\u201d that diagnosis as provided in OEC 412(2)(b)(B). Defendant was entitled to examine Reilly regarding her knowledge of the victim\u2019s previous allegations and the extent to which she did or did not factor such allegations into her diagnosis.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-5\">We turn to whether the probative value of the evidence nevertheless was outweighed by its prejudicial effect. <em>State v. Beeler, </em>166 Or App 275, 999 P2d 497, <em>rev den, </em>331 Or 244 (2000), is exemplary. In that case, the defendant sought to admit evidence that the victim had consensual sexual relations with her boyfriend the day after the defendant allegedly raped her, in furtherance of his theory that the victim had consented to have sex with him. <em>Id. </em>at 277-79. The trial court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>concluded that the evidence was admissible. On appeal, this court determined that the evidence was only marginally relevant to the defendant\u2019s theory of his defense and that, conversely, the value of the evidence for that purpose was outweighed by the state\u2019s interest in protecting victims of sexual crimes from having to make embarrassing disclosures regarding their personal lives. <em>Id. </em>at 285. We therefore reversed and remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-4\">By contrast, in this case, in light of Reilly\u2019s own testimony regarding her diagnostic protocol, the challenged evidence was of significantly greater relevance and, hence, of significantly more probative value to defendant\u2019s defense. Conversely, although evidence that a child previously has made allegations of sexual abuse has the potential to embarrass the child, it arguably does not constitute the sort of embarrassing disclosure of intimate details of a victim\u2019s private life that were at issue in <em>Beeler. </em>On balance, the value of the evidence to the defense is not outweighed by its prejudicial effect. Accordingly, the trial court erred in excluding the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-5\">Finally, we address the state\u2019s argument that any error in excluding the evidence was harmless, that is, that there was little likelihood that it affected the verdict. <em>See </em>OEC 103(1) (evidential error is not presumed to be prejudicial but is reversible only where it affects a substantial right of a party); <em>State v. Keller, </em>315 Or 273, 285-86, 844 P2d 195 (1993) (under OEC 103(1), the verdict shall be affirmed if there is little likelihood that the error affected the verdict). The state points to the victim\u2019s consistent and detailed statements throughout the investigation and prosecution of the case and the fact that the jury was able to assess her credibility at trial. The state also points to testimony by the victim\u2019s grandfather that defendant asked the grandfather to forgive him \u2014 although, as the grandfather testified, \u201cthere was nothing specific said about forgiveness for a specific thing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b232-6\">In <em>Keller, </em>a CARES physician was one of four prosecution witnesses at the defendant\u2019s trial on child sexual abuse charges. The other witnesses were the child, the child\u2019s mother, and the deputy sheriff who had investigated the crime. 315 Or at 286. The defendant was convicted; on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>appeal, he assigned error to the admission of a portion of the CARES physician\u2019s testimony. The Supreme Court determined that admission of the testimony was error. It therefore proceeded to consider whether the error was harmless and concluded that it was not. The court reasoned, in part, that the witness was \u201ca medical doctor with extensive professional experience in the area of child sexual abuse,\u201d that she had \u201ctestified in an authoritative and detailed manner about that subject,\u201d and that her testimony \u201cpresumably was persuasive to the trier of fact\u201d under circumstances where the child\u2019s credibility was important to the outcome of the case. Accordingly, the court could not say with certainty that there was \u201clittle likelihood\u201d that the expert\u2019s testimony affected the jury\u2019s verdict. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b233-4\">The same reasoning applies here. As in <em>Keller, </em>the victim in this case testified; in addition, in both cases, relatives of the victim testified in support of the victim\u2019s testimony. Nevertheless, analogously to the physician witness in <em>Keller, </em>Reilly was a health care professional with extensive experience in the area of child sexual abuse who testified in an authoritative manner regarding her credentials and her diagnosis of the victim. As in <em>Keller, </em>Reilly\u2019s testimony presumably was persuasive to the factfinder. Accordingly, we cannot say that the exclusion of evidence bearing on the issue of the accuracy and competency of Reilly\u2019s diagnosis had \u201clittle likelihood\u201d of affecting the jury\u2019s verdict. For all the described reasons, defendant was entitled to examine Reilly regarding her knowledge of the victim\u2019s previous allegations of sexual abuse and the significance of those allegations to her diagnosis.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-5\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b225-7\"> OEC 412 provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b225-8\">\u201c(2) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, in a prosecution for a crime described in ORS 163.355 to 163.427, or in a prosecution for an attempt to commit one of these crimes, evidence of a victim\u2019s past sexual behavior other than reputation or opinion evidence is * * * not admissible, unless the evidence other than reputation or opinion evidence:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b225-9\">\u201c(a) Is admitted in accordance with subsection (4) of this section [establishing procedural requirements for admission]; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b225-10\">\u201c(b) Is evidence that:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b225-11\">\u201c(A) Relates to the motive or bias of the alleged victim;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b225-12\">\u201c(B) Is necessary to rebut or explain scientific or medical evidence offered by the state; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b225-13\">\u201c(C) Is otherwise constitutionally required to be admitted.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b225-14\">For the purposes of OEC 412, \u201cpast sexual behavior\u201d means \u201ca volitional or non-volitional physical act that the victim has performed for the purpose of the sexual stimulation or gratification of either the victim or another person,\u201d including sexual contact, or an attempt to engage in such contact. <em>State v. Wright, </em>97 Or App 401, 406, 776 P2d 1294, <em>rev den, </em>308 Or 593 (1989).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b227-6\"> Reilly testified that she regarded the absence of physical findings in this case as being \u201cconsistent with the child\u2019s statements\u201d about the type of touching at issue. She conceded, however, that such absence also was consistent with not being touched at all.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b227-7\"> Reilly apparently obtained access to the 2001 evaluation through CARES Northwest, which had prepared it. According to Reilly, the report characterized the 2001 incident as \u201cconcerning for abuse.\u201d The trial court eventually conducted an <em>in camera </em>inspection of the report.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b228-7\"> Before the hearing on defendant\u2019s motion, the trial court had opined that the evidence was not relevant.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
