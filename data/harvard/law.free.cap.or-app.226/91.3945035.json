J.</author>\n<p id=\"b117-4\">This case is before us on remand from the Supreme Court, which vacated our prior decision, <em>State v. Knighton, </em>205 Or App 553, 134 P3d 1111 (2006) <em>(Knighton I), </em>in light of <em>State v. Ramirez, </em>343 Or 505, 173 P3d 817 (2007), <em>adh\u2019d to as modified on recons, </em>344 Or 195, 179 P3d 673 (2008), and <em>State v. Fults, </em>343 Or 515, 173 P3d 822 (2007). <em>State v. Knighton, </em>345 Or 315, 195 P3d 63 (2008). In <em>Knighton I, </em>we vacated defendant\u2019s sentences and remanded for resentencing because the trial court had imposed a departure sentence based on judicial findings that the victim was particularly vulnerable. That factfinding constituted plain error, and we exercised our discretion to correct it. The issue before us on remand is whether, in light of <em>Ramirez </em>and <em>Fults, </em>we properly exercised our discretion under <em>Ailes v. Portland Meadows, Inc., </em>312 Or 376, 381-82, 823 P2d 956 (1991). We conclude that our exercise of discretion in <em>Knighton I </em>was correct. Accordingly, we again remand for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-5\">Defendant was convicted of first-degree theft; first-degree theft by receiving; identity theft; first-degree forgery; and first-degree burglary. Defendant broke into the apartment of his 34-year-old neighbor while the neighbor was in the hospital. Defendant knew of the victim\u2019s hospitalization and believed that the victim was either very ill or had died. The trial court imposed a durational departure sentence of 48 months\u2019 imprisonment on the first-degree burglary conviction. The court gave the following reasons for its departure:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b117-6\">\u201cClearly, this case has the aggravating factor of the vulnerability of the victim. Whether an actor, such as the defendant, wouldn\u2019t have done exactly what the situation was, whether [the victim] was old or young or had whatever kind of illness, but instinctively that this person would be someone that would be easy to steal from because of their circumstances and, of course, they were right, and so I do find that the aggravating factor of the vulnerability of the victim does apply to this case completely.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b117-7\">The question is whether we should exercise our discretion to correct the error in this case. The state argues that we should decline to exercise our discretion, because there is \u201cno legitimate debate\u201d that a jury would have found the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>departure factor relied upon by the trial court. <em>Cf. Ramirez, </em>343 Or at 513 (if there is no legitimate debate about the existence of a sentence enhancement fact, the defendant\u2019s interest in a second sentencing hearing is minimal). We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-4\">In order for there to be \u201cno legitimate debate\u201d about the existence of a departure fact, the evidence in support of that fact must be \u201coverwhelming.\u201d <em>See Ramirez, </em>343 Or at 513 (setting out \u201clegitimate debate\u201d standard for exercise of discretion to review unpreserved challenges to departure sentences based on judicial findings of fact). On this record, we cannot say that there is no legitimate debate that the jury would have found the victim to have been particularly vulnerable. Although the victim was in ill health at the time defendant burglarized his apartment and purloined his identity, the victim was not present when the crimes took place; indeed, the victim was in the hospital. And, although the victim\u2019s ill health did lead to his home being unoccupied when defendant committed his crimes, the same is true for any victim of a residential burglary that occurs during that victim\u2019s hospitalization. <em>Cf State v. Scott, </em>225 Or App 312, 316, 201 P3d 262 (2009) (no legitimate debate that the jury would have found the victim to be particularly vulnerable based on relationship of trust between defendant\u2019s girlfriend and the victim, and that victim was living at the girlfriend\u2019s house, which had provided the opportunity for defendant to commit his crimes). In short, because the evidence is not so \u201coverwhelming\u201d as to establish the <em>particular </em>vulnerability of <em>this </em>victim, we cannot say that the jury in this case lacked a legitimately debatable choice between imposing the presumptive sentence or a departure sentence. <em>Cf State v. Heath </em>226 Or App 242, 244, 203 P3d 242 (2009) (no legitimate debate that the jury would have found that a five-month old child who suffered cracked ribs at the hands of her father was a vulnerable victim).</p>\n<p id=\"b118-5\">Also as relevant to our exercise of discretion, the gravity of the error in this case is not trivial. <em>Ailes, </em>312 Or at 382 n 6. Imposition of the departure sentence increased defendant\u2019s term of incarceration by 23 months. For both of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>those reasons, we exercise our discretion to correct the trial court\u2019s error.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-4\">Remanded for resentencing; otherwise affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
