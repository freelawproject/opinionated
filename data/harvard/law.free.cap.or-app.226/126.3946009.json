Bittner, </em>202 Or App 655, 123 P3d 380 (2005) <em>(Bittner I), </em>in light of <em>State v. Ramirez, </em>343 Or 505, 173 P3d 817 (2007), <em>adh\u2019d to as modified on recons, </em>344 Or 195, 179 P3d 673 (2008). <em>State v. Bittner, </em>345 Or 315, 195 P3d 62 (2008). In <em>Bittner I, </em>we remanded for resentencing because the court had imposed an upward departure sentence on defendant\u2019s conviction for second-degree assault based on judicial fact-finding. That factfinding constituted plain error, and we exercised our discretion to correct it under <em>Ailes v. Portland Meadows, Inc., </em>312 Or 376, 381-82, 823 P2d 956 (1991). The issue on remand is whether, in light of <em>Ramirez </em>and <em>State v. Fults, </em>343 Or 515, 173 P3d 822 (2007), we properly exercised our <em>Ailes </em>discretion. As explained below, we conclude that we properly exercised our discretion. Accordingly, we again affirm defendant\u2019s conviction but remand for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-5\">The pertinent facts underlying the conviction are as follows. Defendant approached the victim \u2014 a stranger \u2014 on the street, said \u201cI\u2019m going to beat the living hell out of you,\u201d and then proceeded to inflict severe injuries on the victim. The mandatory minimum sentence for defendant\u2019s crime pursuant to ORS 137.700 was 70 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-6\">At sentencing, the prosecutor requested the court to impose a departure sentence because defendant is \u201ca very volatile and violent individual who is a severe threat to our community and who would at any time, at any random instant present a violent threat to any citizen who happens to be around.\u201d The prosecutor further noted that the writer of the Presentence Investigation Report (PSI) had recommended a departure sentence of 100 months\u2019 imprisonment, and the prosecutor agreed with that recommendation. The recommendation of 100 months\u2019 imprisonment contained in the PSI was based on the conclusion that two aggravating factors could be applied: (1) defendant was on supervision at the time the current offense was committed; and (2) defendant had been involved in four instances of misconduct while incarcerated on the current charge. At sentencing, the trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>court indicated that it would impose a departure sentence of 100 months, stating that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b153-4\">\u201cthe bottom line is the public needs to be safe from you. And the only way to do that is to depart from the mandatory minimum of 70 months as recommended by the presentence investigation report. The severe aggravating factors more than outweigh any possible potential or even arguable mitigating factors.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b153-5\">On appeal, defendant argues that the imposition of the departure sentence violated his jury trial rights under the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution as set forth in <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 US 296, 124 S Ct 2531, 159 L Ed 2d 403 (2004). Given that the departure sentence was not based on facts found by a jury beyond a reasonable doubt, we agree with defendant that both of those aspects of the sentencing constituted error apparent on the face of the record. ORAP 5.45.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-6\">As noted, the case is on remand for us to consider whether we properly exercised our discretion under the circumstances of this case. In determining whether to exercise our discretion, we are guided by numerous considerations, including \u201cthe competing interests of the parties; the nature of the case; the gravity of the error; the ends of justice in the particular case.\u201d <em>Ailes, </em>312 Or at 382 n 6. The \u201cinterests of the parties\u201d factor includes whether the state has \u201ca significant interest in avoiding a second, unnecessary sentencing hearing.\u201d <em>Ramirez, </em>343 Or at 513. Where we are able to conclude that there would be \u201cno legitimate debate\u201d that a jury would find the facts necessary to support the enhanced sentence, the defendant has no significant interest in resentencing, whereas the state does have a significant interest in avoiding an unnecessary resentencing. <em>Id. </em>The state argues on remand that, in the present case, there is no legitimate debate that a jury would have found aggravating factors in support of a departure sentence, although the state, in its brief, acknowledges that \u201cit is admittedly difficult to discern the precise basis for the trial court\u2019s departure sentence,\u201d because \u201cthe court never specifically identifie[d] which departure factors it [was] finding.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b154-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>In <em>Ramirez, </em>the court, weighing the competing interests of the parties, concluded that it would be an improper exercise of discretion to order resentencing based on judicial factfinding that the victim suffered a permanent injury, given \u201cundisputed evidence in the record * * * that the victim lost her right eye as a result of being shot in the head.\u201d 343 Or at 513. The court emphasized that, if there is \u201cno legitimate debate\u201d concerning the factual predicate for a sentence, the state\u2019s interest in avoiding unnecessary proceedings outweighs a defendant\u2019s interest in correcting the sentencing error. <em>Id. </em>We fail to see how the \u201cno legitimate debate\u201d consideration can be applied in circumstances such as this, where we are not able to discern what the factual predicate for the enhanced sentence <em>was, </em>much less what evidence in the record might have supported it. <em>Cf. State v. Banks, </em>218 Or App 593, 598, 180 P3d 726 (2008), <em>overruled on other grounds hy Oregon v. </em>Ice,_US_, 129 S Ct 711, 172 L Ed 2d 517 (2009) (where basis for enhanced sentence was not clear, court would not speculate as to whether no reasonable fact-finder could have failed to find in support of the enhanced sentence).</p>\n<p id=\"b154-6\">A further consideration in determining whether to exercise discretion in correcting a sentencing error is whether it appears that the defendant may have \u201cmade a strategic choice\u201d not to object to the sentence. <em>Fults, </em>343 Or at 523. Here, defendant did oppose the departure sentence, albeit not on the grounds raised on appeal. Finally, in assessing the gravity of the error, <em>Ailes, </em>312 Or at 382 n 6, we note that the departure sentence here added 30 months to defendant\u2019s prison term. Thus, the length of the erroneously imposed departure sentence weighs in favor of correcting the error, as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-7\">In sum, we conclude that we properly exercised our discretion to remand for correction of the sentencing error.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-8\">Remanded for resentencing; otherwise affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
