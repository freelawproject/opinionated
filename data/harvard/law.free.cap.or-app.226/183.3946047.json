Six months later, the court granted grandparents\u2019 motion to intervene, finding that they had established the child-parent relationship that is a prerequisite to participating as third parties in a custody action. The court subsequently awarded grandparents sole legal and physical custody of T and gave mother and father each limited parenting time.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> On appeal, mother assigns error to all of these outcomes, arguing, among other things, that the trial court erred in concluding that grandparents rebutted the statutory presumption that mother acts in T\u2019s best interest and therefore has a right to make decisions regarding his care and custody. Because we agree that grandparents did not rebut that presumption, we reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-5\">We recite the facts as we find them on <em>de novo </em>review, although we give considerable weight to the trial court\u2019s demeanor-based credibility determinations. ORS 19.415(3); <em>O\u2019Donnell-Lamont and Lamont, </em>337 Or 86, 89, 91 P3d 721 (2004), <em>cert den, </em>543 US 1050 (2005). Mother and father married in 2000, shortly after the birth of their son, T, who was seven years old at the time of trial. Mother filed for dissolution in November 2001 and was appointed T\u2019s primary residential parent in the default dissolution judgment. During and after their marriage, father physically abused mother; after the marriage, he also stalked her. In part to escape that behavior, grandparents helped mother and T move to Guam in October 2004 and to Hawaii in May 2005. In October 2005, mother and T returned to Oregon and moved in with grandparents. Sometime in 2006, following an argument with grandmother, mother moved out, leaving T with grandparents. About two months later, mother obtained <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>stable housing and T moved in with her. Grandparents continued to provide childcare while mother was at work. Mother eventually purchased a house near grandparents.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-3\">On July 8, 2006, mother was involved in an altercation with a former boyfriend, Morales, and was arrested. Morales had a criminal history, including involvement with a gang and dealing drugs. At the time of the altercation, mother was cooperating with law enforcement officers to facilitate Morales\u2019s arrest, and all charges against mother were eventually dismissed. A few days later, however, father sought and obtained an <em>ex parte </em>order granting him temporary custody of T, alleging that mother had been arrested, was abusing drugs, and had exposed T to domestic violence. Mother requested a hearing, at which father did not appear, and, on August 29, the court vacated the temporary custody order.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-4\">A hearing on father\u2019s motion to change custody occurred a few days later, in September 2006. At that hearing, father testified that mother was currently using methamphetamine on a daily basis, that mother was selling drugs, and that he was concerned that T would be exposed to domestic violence if mother reconciled with Morales. Grandmother, however, testified that, although mother was charged with a misdemeanor drug offense in 1998 and completed rehabilitation treatment at that time, she did not believe that mother was currently using drugs:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b210-5\">\u201c[The Court]: [Do you have c]oncerns about your daughter using drugs?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b210-6\">\u201c[Grandmother]: No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b210-7\">\u201c[The Court]: Why not? She was arrested for some stuff involving drugs; right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b210-8\">\u201c[Grandmother]: I think she has in the past. I don\u2019t think she is now.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b210-9\">\u201c[The Court]: And why \u2014 what\u2019s different that makes you think that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b210-10\">\u201c[Grandmother]: I don\u2019t know. She just, you know, she\u2019s attending to [T] and taking care of, you know, leading the responsibilities, from what it appears to me.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b211-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>The judge found grandmother\u2019s testimony credible, stating, \u201cI absolutely believe what * * * grandmother has to say.\u201d He told father, however, \u201cYou lied. You\u2019re a liar. I just want to make sure you know that I know that you are a liar,\u201d and, \u201cI\u2019m finding that you are not a credible witness.\u201d Mother also testified and denied that she was using drugs.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-4\">At the end of the hearing, the judge told the parties,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b211-5\">\u201cI\u2019m real[ly] concerned about what\u2019s happened for this little guy, and I\u2019m not satisfied that either one of these parents is in a position to really parent for him. * * * I\u2019m going to take this case and I\u2019m going to continue it for a period of time. I\u2019m going to talk to DHS and see whether or not they\u2019re going to be involved * * *.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b211-6\">\u201cWe\u2019re going to place the child in * * * grandparents\u2019 home for right now.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b211-7\">\u2021 \u2021 \u2021</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b211-8\">\u201cAnd I can\u2019t trust [mother] to protect the child from [father]. I can\u2019t trust her to protect the child from bad boyfriends. I can\u2019t trust her to protect the child from herself. I don\u2019t know what in the world is going to be happening for this little kid. The only thing I know is that he\u2019s safe and secure with * * * grandparents * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b211-9\">Mother\u2019s attorney did not lodge an objection to that ruling. He subsequently drafted the order granting grandparents temporary custody of T.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-10\">On February 23, 2007, grandparents filed a motion to intervene, seeking permanent custody of T. Grandparents noted, \u201cWhile [T] has been in our care, we have provided his shelter, clothing, food, any medical attention he needed, purchased his toys and books, provided the funds for his entertainment and recreation and parented him including discipline and praise.\u201d The court granted grandparents\u2019 motion to intervene, concluding that \u201c[f]or a period of more than six months * * * grandparents have provided for [T] and have had a parent-child relationship with [T].\u201d The court also noted that DHS had declined to become involved in the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-11\">The final custody hearing occurred on November 20, 2007. Deputy Bowman, one of the officers involved in the incident between mother and Morales, testified that mother <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>had been cooperating with law enforcement officers to help capture Morales. He explained that mother was afraid of Morales and had obtained a firearm for protection. Because mother had a previous felony conviction, however, Bowman had cited her for felon in possession of a firearm. He also testified that the charge was reduced to a misdemeanor and might have been dismissed. Regarding mother\u2019s alleged drug use, Bowman testified as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b212-4\">\u201c[Mother\u2019s Counsel]: Did you ever have concerns that [mother] was using drugs?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b212-5\">\u201c[Bowman]: We heard rumors and she\u2019s consented several times to search of her car and parts of her house, and I\u2019ve never located drugs or seen her in possession of paraphernalia or anything like that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b212-6\">* * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b212-7\">\u201c[Mother\u2019s Counsel]: In your contact with her, have you ever had concerns that she\u2019s using methamphetamine or any other illegal drugs?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b212-8\">\u201c[Bowman]: No.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b212-9\">Guastadisegni, a court-appointed custody evaluator, submitted a detailed 42-page \u201cChild Custody and Parenting Time Report\u201d containing summaries of his interviews with and testing of father, mother, T, and grandparents, as well as his observations of mother interacting with T. He noted that T \u201cseems well adjusted given the turbulence of his life,\u201d and that he had \u201ca primary attachment to his mother. * * * This is a strong attachment that goes beyond his social and functional <em>(e.g., </em>day to day) needs.\u201d He reported that T was doing well in school and that grandparents reported \u201cno major behavioral concerns.\u201d He also observed that mother\u2019s interaction with T seemed strained, but suggested that the cause of that strain was mother\u2019s awareness that she was being observed. He summarized his impressions as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b212-10\">\u201cI have major concerns for [T]. There is no question that [grandparents] are the most stable of the three options to provide a home environment for [T] at this time. However, that does not mean that they should have custody. It is true that [mother] has had some major setbacks in her life and she did not do a good job of prioritizing for the needs of [T]. She encountered significant disruption in her personal life <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>and this directly affected her son. However that does not mean she should have her parental rights usurped. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b213-4\">\u2021 \u2021 \u2021</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b213-5\">\u201cAt the present time I would recommend that the court consider a temporary guardianship for [T] with [grandparents], with the explicit goal of returning [T] to [mother] as the primary custodial parent in the future. I believe this arrangement will ultimately serve [T\u2019s] best interests.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b213-6\">(Underscoring in original.) He recommended that, before allowing T to return to mother, the court should require that she successfully achieve several benchmarks.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-7\">At trial, Guastadisegni\u2019s testimony was consistent with his report. He testified that mother \u201chas been the primary caregiver figure, and * * * for the first six years [T has] been primarily with her.\u201d (T was seven years old at the time of trial.) He did not believe that mother had ever physically abused T, but noted that she had been neglectful of his needs, citing a history of domestic violence between mother and father and between mother and Morales; a history of residential instability; and allegations of drug use. Guastadisegni reported that mother had taken a plea bargain for a forgery charge before T\u2019s birth and had been charged with possession of methamphetamine and driving under the influence of intoxicants, but that mother claimed that all charges against her were misdemeanors and had been expunged. The record does not disclose whether that is accurate. He also noted that mother denied current drug use, and that he had heard only one third-hand account of mother\u2019s drug use and did not know when that alleged use supposedly occurred. Guastadisegni reported that mother had previously been diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), although he noted, \u201cI would question the ADHD diagnosis in [mother].\u201d He stated, \u201cI did not diagnose her with a personality disorder. I diagnosed her, though, with having personality traits of dependency and antisocial personality traits as well.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b213-8\">Regarding mother\u2019s present fitness to serve as T\u2019s parent, he stated at one point, \u201cToday I would say no.\u201d He also testified as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b214-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>\u201c[Mother\u2019s Counsel]: Okay. And if I understand your testimony, you\u2019re not saying that [mother] is not minimally fit?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b214-4\">\u201c[Guastadisegni]: No, I\u2019m not saying that. I think she needs the services recommended and I think she needs time to do that, and I think she would be adequate to parent [T],</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b214-5\">\u201c[Mother\u2019s Counsel]: * * * Do you think it would be in [T]\u2019s best interests to be removed from the care of his mother * * *?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b214-6\">\u201c[Guastadisegni]: I think it would be in the best interests of [T] to be with his mother as long as she can make the necessary changes and provide stability and consistency, because he\u2019s primarily attached to her. And I think that relationship is a healthy one. But if the patterns of behaviors that she demonstrated in the past were to continue to resurface, then he would be better off [with grandparents] * * * \u00bb</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b214-9\">When asked if he believed T would be safe if he stayed overnight for several days with mother, Guastadisegni stated, \u201cI do believe that [mother] would be safe and that she wouldn\u2019t put [T] at risk.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b214-10\">The judge, however, awarded sole legal and physical custody of T to grandparents and made the following findings:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b214-11\">\u201c(a) Since September 7, 2006, [grandparents] have been [T]\u2019s primary caretakers;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b214-12\">\u201c(b) Information before this court, including the testimony of [Guastadisegni], shows by a preponderance of the evidence that neither Mother nor Father is presently able to care adequately for [T], and that circumstances detrimental to [T] exist if [grandparents] are not granted custody of him;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b214-13\">\u201c(c) Neither parent has unreasonably denied or limited contact between [T] and [grandparents]; therefore</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b214-14\">\u201c(d) It is in [T]\u2019s best interest that sole legal and physical custody be awarded to [grandparents], who have established a child-parent relationship with him * * *.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b214-15\">The judgment allowed mother limited unsupervised parenting time with additional visitation after two months if she <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>completed a list of conditions, including keeping stable housing, not possessing firearms, not using drugs or alcohol within 24 hours of parenting time, not involving herself in violent relationships, not associating with known criminals or substance abusers, attending parenting and domestic violence education classes, and participating in mental health therapy.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-3\">ORS 109.119 establishes the conditions and procedures governing third-party custody. That statute permits a nonparent \u201cwho has established emotional ties creating a child-parent relationship\u201d to petition a court for custody, guardianship, or visitation rights with a child. ORS 109.119(1), (3). A \u201cchild-parent relationship\u201d is defined, in part, as</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b215-4\">\u201ca relationship that exists or did exist, in whole or in part, within the six months preceding the filing of an action under this section, and in which relationship a person having physical custody of a child or residing in the same household as the child supplied, or otherwise made available to the child, food, clothing, shelter and incidental necessaries and provided the child with necessary care, education and discipline, and which relationship continued on a day-to-day basis, through interaction, companionship, interplay and mutuality, that fulfilled the child\u2019s psychological needs for a parent as well as the child\u2019s physical needs.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b215-5\">ORS 109.119(10)(a). In order for nonparent petitioners to gain custody, they must overcome \u201ca presumption that the legal parent acts in the best interest of the child.\u201d ORS 109.119(2)(a). ORS 109.119(4)(b) describes how the presumption may be rebutted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b215-6\">\u201cIn deciding whether the presumption described in subsection (2)(a) of this section has been rebutted and whether to award custody, guardianship or other rights over the objection of the legal parent, the court may consider factors including, but not limited to, the following, which may be shown by the evidence:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b215-7\">\u201c(A) The legal parent is unwilling or unable to care adequately for the child;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b215-8\">\u201c(B) The petitioner or intervenor is or recently has been the child\u2019s primary caretaker;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b216-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>\u201c(C) Circumstances detrimental to the child exist if relief is denied;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b216-4\">\u201c(D) The legal parent has fostered, encouraged or consented to the relationship between the child and the petitioner or intervenor; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b216-5\">\u201c(E) The legal parent has unreasonably denied or limited contact between the child and the petitioner or intervenor.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b216-6\">ORS 109.119(10)(b) clarifies that \u201c \u2018circumstances detrimental to the child\u2019 includes but is not limited to circumstances that may cause psychological, emotional or physical harm to a child.\u201d The court must find \u201cby a preponderance of the evidence,\u201d ORS 109.119(3)(a), that the presumption has been rebutted in order to grant custody to a nonparent over a legal parent\u2019s objection. Finally, if the nonparent has established a child-parent relationship and overcome the presumption in favor of the legal parent, ORS 109.119(3)(a) provides that the court shall grant custody to the petitioner only \u201cif to do so is in the best interest of the child.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b216-7\">In her first three assignments of error, mother argues that the trial court erred in finding that grandparents had established a child-parent relationship with T. She contends that the court erred, first, in giving grandparents temporary custody at the September 7, 2006, hearing, where they were not parties and did not request custody; second, in relying on the relationship that developed during that (allegedly) unlawfully obtained temporary custody as the basis for determining that grandparents had established the requisite child-parent relationship; and third, in finding that the relationship that developed met the statutory definition of \u201cchild-parent relationship.\u201d Mother\u2019s three remaining assignments of error relate to the court\u2019s final custody order. She argues that the court erred, first, in concluding that grandparents rebutted the statutory presumption that she acts in T\u2019s best interest; second, in awarding custody of T to grandparents; and third, in failing to adopt the custody evaluator\u2019s recommendation of more extensive parenting time. We agree with mother that, even if we were to presume for the sake of argument that grandparents validly established a child-parent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>relationship, grandparents did not overcome the presumption in mother\u2019s favor and, consequently, the court erred in awarding custody to them instead of to mother. We therefore need not and do not address the other assignments of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-4\">In determining whether grandparents overcame the statutory presumption in favor of mother, we consider the rebuttal factors in ORS 109.119; although those are not the only factors that we can consider, the parties have not suggested others and we have not found any that are relevant. \u201cIn specific cases, the weight to be given to each of the five statutory factors, to the evidence supporting those factors, and to other relevant evidence, will vary.\u201d <em>O\u2019Donnell-Lamont, </em>337 Or at 108. Our focus \u201cis not on whether one or more of the statutory factors are present, but on whether the evidence as a whole is sufficient to overcome the presumption that the parent acts in the best interest of the child.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 109. We consider each factor in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-5\">The first \u2014 and, at least in this case, the most important \u2014 factor is whether the \u201clegal parent is unwilling or unable to care adequately for the child.\u201d ORS 109.119(4)(b)(A). In <em>O\u2019Donnell-Lamont, </em>the court emphasized that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b217-6\">\u201cconsideration of this factor does not allow the court to substitute its judgment for that of a parent by determining that the nonparent is <em>better </em>able to care for the child. The legislature\u2019s use of the word \u2018adequate\u2019 suggests that the parent must have the willingness and ability to provide something more than a bare subsistence level of care for the child, but that it would be inappropriate to compare a parent\u2019s \u2018adequate\u2019 care with a nonparent\u2019s \u2018more than adequate\u2019 care in considering this factor.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b217-7\">337 Or at 110 (emphasis in original). Thus, in <em>Muhlheim v. </em>Armstrong, 217 Or App 275, 282, 286, 175 P3d 521 (2007), <em>rev den, </em>344 Or 558 (2008), the father\u2019s criminal history, including convictions for felony eluding a police officer and misdemeanor battery, was \u201chardly laudatory, [but] not so extensive or egregious to suggest that he is currently unable to be an adequate parent.\u201d In <em>Muhlheim, </em>the only evidence in the record that related to the father\u2019s alleged substance abuse was conviction for possession of less than an ounce of marijuana, which occurred before the child was born, and driving under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>the influence of intoxicants. The court concluded that, \u201c[although those circumstances may well indicate that [the] father had, or may even continue to have, issues involving substance abuse, they come nowhere near establishing that he has substance abuse problems that rise to the level of making him currently unable to adequately care for a child.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 286; <em>accord Strome and Strome, </em>201 Or App 625, 629-30, 633,120 P3d 499, <em>rev den, </em>339 Or 701 (2005) (the father\u2019s \u201cpast inadequacies as a parent\u201d \u2014 including limited involvement with the children, yelling at them and calling them obscene names, taking drugs, and working as an escort \u2014 did not establish that he was unwilling or unable to care for the children at the time of trial).</p>\n<p id=\"b218-4\">In the present case, Guastadisegni determined that mother was unable to parent T because she \u201chas been historically unstable,\u201d citing drug abuse, domestic violence, residential instability, and her criminal record. Grandparents also cite mother\u2019s \u201csignificant mental problems\u201d and involvement with gang members. Regardless of whether mother was \u201chistorically unstable,\u201d however, we conclude that grandparents did not show by a preponderance of the evidence that mother was <em>currently </em>unable or unwilling to adequately parent T. Father\u2019s testimony was the only evidence that mother was currently using drugs, and the judge stated in emphatic terms that he was not a credible witness. Grandmother, whom the judge found highly credible, testified that she did not believe that mother was currently using drugs. Bowman testified that, in his contacts with mother, he had never seen drugs or drug paraphernalia, and he did not have any evidence of or concerns about drug use. Allegations that mother was currently exposing T to domestic violence or to known gang members are similarly unsubstantiated on the record; mother obtained a restraining order against father and testified that she continued to see him only because the court awarded him temporary custody of T, and father\u2019s testimony was the only evidence suggesting that mother might continue to date Morales. Nothing in the record suggests current residential instability; in fact, mother purchased a house before the final custody hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-5\">Further, the record is unclear regarding mother\u2019s criminal history. Mother told Guastadisegni that her prior <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>convictions were reduced to misdemeanors and expunged; Bowman testified that he was unclear whether the citation for felon in possession of a firearm was dismissed, and grandparents, who had the burden of proving unfitness, produced no evidence that it had not. In any event, although grandmother alluded to mother\u2019s criminal convictions, it is unclear whether any of them occurred after T\u2019s birth. Finally, Guastadisegni\u2019s statements that mother had \u201ctraits of dependency and antisocial personality traits\u201d and was previously diagnosed with ADHD and PTSD are insufficient to establish that mother cannot care for T, in the absence of evidence demonstrating that those traits or diagnoses affect her ability to parent and given his statement that he \u201cwould question the ADHD diagnosis in [mother].\u201d That conclusion is fortified by Guastadisegni\u2019s observation that T was doing well in school and that grandparents reported \u201cno major behavioral concerns.\u201d The evidence therefore does not support the trial court\u2019s conclusion that mother was presently unable to care adequately for T.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-4\">The second rebuttal factor is whether grandparents have shown that they \u201c[are] or recently [have] been the child\u2019s primary caretaker[s].\u201d ORS 109.119(4)(b)(B). \u201cThis factor focuses on the interest in continuity of caregiving and the relationship between the child and the nonparent seeking custody.\u201d <em>O\u2019Donnell-Lamont, </em>337 Or at 111. In the present case, grandparents became T\u2019s primary caretakers when they were awarded temporary custody on September 7,2006. Guastadisegni testified, however, that, before grandparents were awarded temporary custody, mother was \u201cthe primary caregiver figure, and * * * for the first six years [T has] been primarily with her.\u201d Because both mother and grandparents recently had filled the primary caretaker role for T, we give this factor little weight. <em>See Wilson and Wilson, </em>199 Or App 242, 251, 110 P3d 1106 (2005) (concluding that, where the parties previously shared custody and were both involved with the children, this factor \u201cdoes not carry significant weight\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b219-5\"> The third rebuttal factor is whether \u201c[c]ircumstances detrimental to the child exist\u201d if the nonparent is not awarded relief. ORS 109.119(4)(b)(C). Such circumstances include, but are not limited to, \u201ccircumstances that may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>cause psychological, emotional or physical harm to a child.\u201d ORS 109.119(10)(b). A nonparent must show that the \u201ccircumstances of living with the legal parent pose a serious <em>present </em>risk\u201d of such harm; it is not enough to show that living with a legal parent <em>may </em>cause such harm. <em>O\u2019Donnell-Lamont, </em>337 Or at 112-13 (emphasis added). Although a parent\u2019s frequent change of residences does not, by itself, show \u201ccircumstances detrimental to the child,\u201d when the parent \u201cchooses to move often not because of employment or other external considerations but simply because of a desire to move, and the parent fails to consider the impact of the moves on the child, those moves can be relevant\u201d to our determination. <em>Id. </em>at 115.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-4\">In the present case, as discussed above, most of the evidence weighing against mother\u2019s ability to parent T had to do with whether she was \u201chistorically unstable,\u201d rather than whether her custody of T posed a serious <em>present </em>risk of harm to him. Evidence that mother previously abused drugs, exposed T to domestic violence, or had a criminal record, in the absence of evidence of a present risk of harm, is insufficient to establish circumstances detrimental to the child. <em>See Strome, </em>201 Or App at 634-35 (\u201cIn the absence of evidence that father\u2019s drug use has continued into the present, * * * we cannot conclude that father\u2019s past substance abuse poses a serious present risk of psychological, emotional, or physical harm.\u201d). Further, the evidence suggests that mother\u2019s previous residential instability was due, at least in part, to her efforts to escape abuse by father. And finally, we note that there is no evidence that T has suffered any detrimental effects from mother\u2019s conduct. Grandparents and the teacher whom Guastadisegni interviewed testified that he has no significant problems. We conclude that grandparents did not establish by a preponderance of the evidence that circumstances detrimental to T exist if grandparents are not awarded relief.</p>\n<p id=\"AnH\">The fourth rebuttal factor is whether the \u201clegal parent has fostered, encouraged or consented to the relationship between the child and the [nonparent].\u201d ORS 109.119(4)(b)(D). If the legal parent has fostered such a relationship, a court may infer that \u201cthe legal parent, at least at one point, apparently believed that that relationship was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>beneficial, or at least not detrimental, to the child.\u201d <em>O\u2019Donnell-Lamont, </em>337 Or at 115. In the present case, the evidence shows that mother fostered such a relationship between grandparents and T, leaving T with grandparents for approximately two months until she obtained stable housing and relying on grandparents for work-related child care. However, we give this factor little weight because, under the circumstances of this case, \u201cthe fact that [mother] consented to grandparents serving as primary caregivers and otherwise having a close relationship with [T] does not indicate in any way that [s]he does not act in the best interests of the [child].\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 115-16.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-4\">The final rebuttal factor is whether the \u201clegal parent has unreasonably denied or limited contact between the child and the [nonparent].\u201d ORS 109.119(4)(b)(E).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In addressing this factor, we may consider whether a parent will, in the future, unreasonably restrict or preclude contact between a child and the nonparent. <em>Muhlheim, </em>217 Or App at 289. In the present case, mother purchased a house near grandparents\u2019 home and has historically relied on grandparents for childcare. On this record, we find no indication that mother ever denied or limited T\u2019s contact with grandparents, and no reason to suggest that she might. We therefore conclude that grandparents failed to establish by a preponderance of the evidence that mother has or will unreasonably restrict contact between T and grandparents.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-6\">We conclude that, under the totality of the circumstances, grandparents have not rebutted the statutory presumption that mother acts in the best interest of T, and that mother therefore cannot be deprived of custody in favor of grandparents. The question of the scope of our remand remains. In <em>Strome, </em>we observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b221-7\">\u201cWhile we recognize that appellate courts necessarily must review a record at a given point in time, we also understand that five years have passed since this case was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>decided in the trial court. During the pendency of appeal, the children have lived with their grandmother. Under these circumstances, we conclude that father is entitled to custody after a period of transition designed to ensure that the children\u2019s needs are best met. Accordingly, we remand the case to the trial court to establish an appropriate plan to transition the children to father\u2019s custody that includes ample contact between the children and grandmother.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b222-4\">201 Or App at 639 (citation omitted). In the present case, T has been in grandparents\u2019 care since September 2006. Indeed, mother acknowledges that a period of transition, as Guastadisegni recommended, is appropriate. Therefore, as in <em>Strome, </em>\u201cwe conclude that [mother] is entitled to custody after a period of transition designed to ensure that [T\u2019s] needs are best met,\u201d and we remand the case to the trial court \u201cto establish an appropriate plan to [effectuate the transition of T] to [mother\u2019s] custody that includes ample contact between\u201d T and grandparents. <em>Id. </em>That plan may contain specific conditions for mother to meet, as Guastadisegni recommended and the trial court originally imposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-5\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b209-6\"> We refer to the parties from the perspective of T, that is, as mother, father, and grandparents.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b209-7\"> Father is not a party on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b221-8\"> We note that the fourth and fifth rebuttal factors appear to be in conflict with each other, or at least to put a parent who is involved in a third-party custody dispute in a difficult position. If the parent encourages a relationship between the third party and the child, that encouragement works against the parent under the fourth factor; if the parent discourages the relationship, that works against the parent under the fifth factor.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
