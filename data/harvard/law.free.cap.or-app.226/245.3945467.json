Nyquist, </em>202 Or App 325, 120 P3d 1292 (2005) <em>(Nyquist I), </em>in light <em>of State v. Ramirez, </em>343 Or 505, 173 P3d 817 (2007), <em>adh\u2019d to as modified on recons, </em>344 Or 195, 179 P3d 673 (2008), and <em>State v. Fults, </em>343 Or 515, 173 P3d 822 (2007). <em>State v. Nyquist, </em>345 Or 316, 195 P3d 63 (2008). In <em>Nyquist I, </em>we vacated defendant\u2019s sentences and remanded for resentencing because the trial court had imposed a departure sentence based on judicial findings that defendant had used a gun in committing his crimes. That factfinding constituted plain error, and we exercised our discretion to correct it. The issue before us on remand is whether, in light of <em>Ramirez </em>and <em>Fults, </em>we properly exercised our discretion under <em>Ailes v. Portland Meadows, Inc., </em>312 Or 376, 381-82, 823 P2d 956 (1991). We conclude that our exercise of discretion in <em>Nyquist I </em>was erroneous. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-5\">Defendant was convicted of attempted murder, first-degree assault, felon in possession of a firearm, and unlawful use of a weapon. The trial court imposed a durational departure sentence of 130 months\u2019 imprisonment on the attempted murder conviction, 90 months of which were imposed pursuant to ORS 137.700 (Measure 11). The trial court gave the following reasons for its departure:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b274-6\">\u201cI do think that this is a crime where a departure sentence is appropriate. The reason I say that is I think there is substantial and compelling reasons. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b274-7\">ij:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b274-8\">\u201c[A]ny attempted murder involves violence, any attempted murder involves the use of a weapon or the threat of death, and so that\u2019s not the aggravating factor. It\u2019s the use of the gun again, it\u2019s the violence in addition to just the criminal motive in this particular case, and I think that is a compelling reason, and so I am going to order that a departure sentence, a durational departure is appropriate!.]\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b274-9\">In this case, the trial court imposed a departure sentence based on defendant\u2019s use of a gun in committing his crimes. The jury convicted defendant of felon in possession of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>a firearm and unlawful use of a weapon in addition to attempted murder and first-degree assault. The jury thus necessarily found that defendant had used a gun in committing his crimes, as that fact is an element of both the unlawful use of a weapon and felon in possession of a firearm convictions. It follows that there is no legitimate debate that the jury found the same departure fact relied on by the trial court. <em>See Ramirez, </em>343 Or at 513 (setting out \u201clegitimate debate\u201d standard for exercise of discretion to review unpreserved challenges to departure sentences based on judicial findings of fact). Accordingly, we decline to exercise our discretion to correct the assigned error.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
