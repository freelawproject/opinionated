INTRODUCTION</p>\n<p id=\"b128-6\">In these cases, Attorneys General from the states of Illinois, Ohio, Florida, Mississippi, Kentucky, Idaho, Pennsylvania and the New York Counties of Oswego, Erie and Schenectady allege that pharmaceutical companies fraudulently inflated drug prices which caused the states and counties to pay excessive reimbursements under the Medicaid program. Each complaint, alleging state causes of action, was filed in state court. Defendant Dey, Boeh-ringer, or Abbott has removed each of these cases, arguing that the unsealing of the federal False Claims Act actions against them provides a new basis for federal jurisdiction. Plaintiffs, arguing that removal is groundless and untimely, seek remand. After hearing, the motions to remand all the actions are <em>ALLOWED.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b128-7\">II. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b128-8\">Plaintiffs\u2019 claims form part of the massive Average Wholesale Price (\u201cAWP\u201d) multidistrict litigation (\u201cMDL\u201d) pending in this Court. The Court assumes close familiarity with that lawsuit, as well as the alleged drug pricing schemes discussed in its previous AWP MDL decisions. <em>See, e.g., In re Pharm. Indus. Average Wholesale Price Litig., </em>491 F.Supp.2d 20 (D.Mass. June 21, 2007); (making findings of fact and conclusions of law following a bench trial on claims under Massachusetts consumer protection laws); <em>In re Pharm. Indus. Average Wholesale Price Litig. </em>431 F.Supp.2d 98 (D.Mass.2006) (remanding cases); <em>In re Pharm. Indus. Average Wholesale Price Litig., </em>230 F.R.D. 61 (D.Mass.2005) (certifying a national class action); <em>In re Pharm. Indus. Average Wholesale Price Litig., </em>263 F.Supp.2d 172 (D.Mass.2003) (dismissing RICO claims).</p>\n<p id=\"b128-16\">The United States has also been active in bringing AWP litigation against the same pharmaceutical manufacturers, in the form of qui tarn lawsuits pursuant to the federal False Claims Act (\u201cFCA\u201d), 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3729 et seq. On March 17, 2006, the United States intervened in a qui tam lawsuit against various pharmaceutical defendants, <em>United States ex rel. Ven-a-Care of the Florida Keys, Inc., et al. v. Abbott Laboratories, </em>Civil Action No. 95-1354-CIV (S.D.Fla.);<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>United States of America ex rel. Ven-A-Care of the Florida Keys, Inc. v. Dey, Inc., et. al., </em>Civil Action No. 05-11084-MEL (D.Mass.);<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>United States of America ex rel. Ven-A-Care of the Florida Keys, Inc., et al. v. Boehringer Ingelheim Corporation, et al., </em>Civil Action No. 07-10248-MEL (D.Mass.). These federal actions concern the same factual circumstances and fraud allegations as the state actions. The defendants subsequently removed the cases that were pending in state courts arguing that 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3732(b)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> confers original federal jurisdiction given the existence of the federal false claims action.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> All actions were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>subsequently transferred to this Court as part of this multidistrict litigation. The plaintiff states and New York counties have moved to remand the cases back to the state courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-5\">Defendants in the Illinois and Ohio actions moved for leave to file an additional ground for removal. On October 24, 2006 this Court issued a decision, as part of this MDL, denying the state of Arizona\u2019s motion to remand its case. <em>See In re Pharm. Indus. Average Wholesale Price Litig., 431 </em>F.Supp.2d 77 (D.Mass.2006) (Saris, J.). In that order, I explained that the claims on behalf of Medicare Part B beneficiaries raised a substantial federal issue such that federal jurisdiction was appropriate under the test formulated by the Supreme Court in <em>Grable &amp; Sons Metal Products, Inc. v. Darue Engineering &amp; Manufacturing, </em>545 U.S. 308, 125 S.Ct. 2363, 162 L.Ed.2d 257 (2005). Defendants now assert that in the Illinois and Ohio cases, removal is proper because the complaints seek recovery of Medicare Part B prescription drug co-payments and the removal notices were filed within thirty days of the Arizona decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-6\">III. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b129-7\">A. <em>Removal Based on the Unsealing of the Qui Tam Actions</em></p>\n<p id=\"b129-8\">Defendants removed the cases pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1441, which states that \u201cany civil action brought in a state court of which the district courts of the United States have original jurisdiction, may be removed \u2014 \u201d28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1441(a). Original federal question jurisdiction exists over \u201ccivil actions arising under the Constitution, laws, or treaties of the United States.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331. The defendant bears the burden of establishing the existence of federal jurisdiction. <em>BIW Deceived v. Local S6, </em>132 F.3d 824, 831 (1st Cir.1997). The removal statute should be strictly construed, and any doubts about the propriety of removal should be construed against the party seeking removal. <em>See, e.g., Danca v. Private Health Care Sys., Inc., </em>185 F.3d 1, 4 (1st Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b129-11\">Defendants contend that 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3732(b) constitutes a basis for original subject matter jurisdiction, making the cases removable. Under \u00a7 3732(b), \u201c[t]he district courts shall have jurisdiction over any action brought under the laws of any State for the recovery of funds paid by a State or local government if the action arises from the same transaction or occurrence as an action brought under section 3730.\u201d Section 3730 provides for civil actions under the federal False Claims Act. Because the federal and state cases against Dey arise from the same transaction or occurrence, defendants argue that federal courts have jurisdiction over both cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-12\">1. <em>Timeliness of Removal</em></p>\n<p id=\"b129-13\">The threshold issue is the timeliness of the removal. Generally, a defendant must seek removal within thirty days of receipt of the pleadings or summons. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1446(b). However, a defendant may also file a notice of removal \u201cwithin thirty days after receipt by the defendant, through service or otherwise, of a copy of an amended pleading, motion, order or other paper from which it may first be ascertained that the case is one which is or has become removable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>It is undisputed that defendants did not file a removal notice within thirty days of the initial pleading. Defendants argue that the removal clock began to tick again when it received from the United States Department of Justice a copy of the federal qui <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>tam complaint and the unsealing order issued by the federal court in Boston.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-4\">The difficult issue is whether receipt of the qui tam complaint and unsealing order constitutes receipt of \u201corders or other papers\u201d that restarted the time period for filing for removal on those grounds. Plaintiff contends that neither can be considered as \u201can order\u201d or \u201cother paper\u201d because Section 1446(b) only applies to events that occur within the state-court action being removed that are caused by a \u201cvoluntary act\u201d of the plaintiff. <em>See California v. Keating, </em>986 F.2d 346, 348 (9th Cir.1993) (\u201c[A] suit which, at the time of filing, could not have been brought in federal court must remain in state court unless a \u2018voluntary\u2019 act of the plaintiff brings about a change that renders the case removable.\u201d) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted); <em>Addo v. Globe Life &amp; Acc. Ins. Co., </em>230 F.3d 759, 762 (5th Cir.2000) (\u201c \u2018[OJther paper\u2019 must result from the voluntary act of a plaintiff which gives the defendant notice of the changed circumstances which now support federal jurisdiction.\u201d); <em>Morsani v. Major League Baseball, </em>79 F.Supp.2d 1331, 1333 n. 5 (M.D.Fla.1999); (\u201cIn both federal question and diversity cases ... Section 1446(b) restricts defendants from removing most cases when the circumstances potentially allowing removal arises through no consequence of the plaintiffs actions.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b130-5\">The First Circuit has not yet addressed the interpretation of \u201corder or other paper\u201d under \u00a7 1446(b). Most of the courts that have addressed this language have held that an unrelated court decision does not constitute an \u201corder or other paper.\u201d <em>See In re Pharm. Average Wholesale Price Litig., </em>431 F.Supp.2d at 106 (reciting a list of cases addressing the issue). The two primary exceptions to this finding are two circuit cases, <em>Doe v. American Red Cross, </em>14 F.3d 196 (3d Cir.1993) and <em>Green v. R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co., </em>274 F.3d 263 (5th Cir.2001) which carved out limited circumstances under which an unrelated court decision could constitute an \u201corder or other paper.\u201d The parties dispute the meaning of these two cases, and their application to these facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-7\">The Third Circuit described the background of <em>Doe:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b130-8\">The American Red Cross and the American National Red Cross (hereinafter \u201cRed Cross\u201d) have been sued in state courts across the country by plaintiffs claiming that they contracted Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) through contaminated blood transfusions and that them injuries were caused by negligence on the part of the Red Cross. In a common pattern, the Red Cross removed these actions to federal court, only to have some of them remanded on the ground that its charter did not confer original jurisdiction on the federal courts. While these remanded cases were pending in state courts, the Court issued its order in S.G. authorizing the Red Cross to remove \u201cany state-law actions it is defending.\u201d In response to S.G., the Red Cross typically removed the actions it was defending to federal court, and again plaintiffs sought remand.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b130-9\"><em>Doe, </em>14 F.3d at 197-98 (citation omitted). Emphasizing the Supreme Court\u2019s specific authorization to the Red Cross to remove \u201cany state-law action it is defending,\u201d the Third Circuit in Doe concluded that the Supreme Court\u2019s decision was an \u201corder\u201d under \u00a7 1446(b) and permitted removal. However, the Third Circuit limited its holding by stating that a court decision</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A2T\">must be sufficiently related to a pending case to trigger Section 1446(b) remova-bility. We believe that an order is sufficiently related when, as here, the order in the case came from a court superior <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>in the same judicial hierarchy, was directed at a particular defendant and expressly authorized that same defendant to remove an action against it in another case involving similar facts and legal issues.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b131-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 202-03.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-6\"><em>Green, </em>a subsequent Fifth Circuit case, built upon the framework laid out in <em>Doe. </em>In <em>Green, </em>plaintiffs brought a product liability suit in Texas state court against various tobacco companies. The Fifth Circuit found that its decision in <em>Sanchez v. Liggett &amp; Myers, Inc., </em>187 F.3d 486 (5th Cir.1999) was an \u201corder\u201d under \u00a7 1446(b).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Agc\">[Hjere the defendants R.J. Reynolds, Brown and Williamson, and Philip Morris were all defendants in the Sanchez case, which involved a similar factual situation and legal conclusion (that Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem.Code \u00a7 82.004 bars most products liability actions against manufacturers or sellers of cigarettes). Although Sanchez did not explicitly discuss removal, the effect of the decision in Sanchez has a similar effect on our case as the S.G. decision had on American Red Cross, i.e. that these defendants cannot be sued under Texas law. The similarities between this case and Sanchez bring this case within the limited parameters of American Red Cross. We therefore hold that the Sanchez opinion, under these very narrow circumstances, was an \u201corder\u201d for purposes of \u00a7 1446(b) removal in this case involving the same defendants, and a similar factual situation and legal issue.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b131-7\"><em>Green, </em>274 F.3d at 268.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-8\">Defendants point out several parallels between this case and the <em>Green </em>case. The Fifth Circuit emphasized that the <em>Sanchez </em>case, which the court held to be an \u201cother order,\u201d involved \u201cthe same defendants, and a similar factual situation and legal issue.\u201d Here, the nexus between the qui tam and removed actions is substantial as both involve a similar factual situation, similar legal issues, and the same defendant. Plaintiff responds that this Court cannot be considered a court superi- or in the judicial hierarchy, a factor that was important to both the <em>Green </em>and <em>Doe </em>decisions. Furthermore, plaintiffs highlight the fact that both decisions were careful to limit their holding to the narrow circumstances of their particular cases. <em>See Doe, </em>14 F.3d at 202 (\u2018We take an extremely confined view of this case and our holding is equally narrow.\u201d); <em>Green, </em>274 F.3d at 268 (\u201cWe therefore hold that the Sanchez opinion, under these very narrow circumstances, was an \u2018order\u2019 for purposes of \u00a7 1446(b) removal in this case ...\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b131-12\">Four district courts have already addressed the timeliness issue in the exact context presented in this case, the unsealing of a federal qui tam action.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Each of these courts have determined that the qui tam complaint and the order unsealing the action are not \u201corders or other papers\u201d within the meaning of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1446(b). <em>See Hawaii v. Abbott Labs., Inc., </em>469 F.Supp.2d 842, 851 (D.Haw.2006); <em>Wisconsin v. Amgen, Inc., </em>469 F.Supp.2d 655, 663 (W.D.Wis. Jan.16, 2007); <em>South Carolina v. Boehringer Ingelheim Roxane, Inc., </em>2007 WL 1232156, 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 30983 (D.S.C. April 26, 2007); <em>Alabama v. Abbott Labs, Inc., </em>2006 WL 3170553, at *11, 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 80446, at *11 (M.D.Ala. Nov. 2, 2006). The parties have not found any other cases addressing the removal of a related action based upon the unsealing of a qui tam action.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>This issue presents a particularly difficult and close question, with persuasive arguments on both sides. Because I find, as explained below, that \u00a7 3732(b) does not provide a basis for removal, I need not decide the timeliness issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-4\">2. <em>Jurisdiction under \u00a7 3732(b)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b132-5\">Plaintiffs argue that \u00a7 3732(b) confers only supplemental jurisdiction, which does not provide a basis for removal. <em>See Syngenta Crop Prot., Inc. v. Henson, </em>537 U.S. 28, 34, 123 S.Ct. 366, 154 L.Ed.2d 368 (2002) (\u201c[a]ncillary jurisdiction ... cannot provide the original jurisdiction that petitioners must show in order to qualify for removal under \u00a7 1441\u201d). In support, they point out that Congress explicitly provides for original jurisdiction when it intends to do so.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Still, the Supreme Court has held that Congress sometimes grants original jurisdiction without using the phrase \u201coriginal jurisdiction.\u201d <em>See American National Red Cross v. S. G. and A.E., </em>505 U.S. 247, 112 S.Ct. 2465, 120 L.Ed.2d 201 (1992) (holding that the \u201csue or be sued\u201d provision of the American Red Cross charter confers original jurisdiction on federal courts). In several statutes, Congress has granted jurisdiction to adjudicate a case in the first instance, without using the words \u201coriginal jurisdiction.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b132-6\">Defendants argue that jurisdiction must be \u201coriginal\u201d because Congress chose to apply the statute to \u201cactions\u201d rather than \u201cclaims,\u201d the operative word in the \u201csupplemental jurisdiction\u201d statute, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1367. This distinction does not appear to carry any weight. First, Congress did not pass \u00a7 1367 until four years after the codification of \u00a7 3732(b). <em>See </em>Pub.L. No. 101-650, \u00a7 310(a), 104 Stat. 5113 (1990). Furthermore, the Supreme Court recently noted that statutory references to \u201cactions\u201d and \u201cclaims\u201d are generally not treated differently. <em>See Jones v. Bock, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, \u2014, 127 S.Ct. 910, 924, 166 L.Ed.2d 798,(2007) (\u201cMore generally, statutory references to an \u2018action\u2019 have not typically been read to mean that every claim included in the action must meet the pertinent requirement before the \u2018action\u2019 may proceed.\u201d)</p>\n<p id=\"b132-12\">The bottom line is that the plain language of the statute is not a silver bullet in the quest to determine whether Congress intended to confer \u201coriginal\u201d or \u201csupplemental\u201d jurisdiction. The statute is ambiguous.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-13\">The legislative history of the passage of 3732(b) provides some guidance. Plaintiffs argue that section 3732(b) should be read as an exception to the \u201cgeneral bar on intervention,\u201d codified at \u00a7 3730(b)(5), which would prevent parties other than the United States from bringing related actions. Section 3730(b)(5) provides: \u201cWhen a person brings an action under this subsection, no person other than the Government may intervene or bring a related action based on the facts underlying the [federal FCA] action.\u201d Under plaintiffs\u2019 interpretation, \u00a7 3732(b) therefore pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>vides a means for a state to join a pending federal FCA action to recover state funds lost in the same transactions.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-5\">The legislative history of \u00a7 3732(b) supports this interpretation, suggesting that Congress intended the provision to enhance the options of the states, rather than to restrict them. The National Association of Attorneys General (\u201cNAAG\u201d) was instrumental in lobbying for section 3732(b) as part of the 1986 Amendments to the FCA. As the Senate Report accompanying the 1986 Amendments explains:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b133-6\">And finally, in response to comments from the National Association of [State] Attorneys General, the subcommittee adopted a provision allowing State and local governments to join State law actions with False Claims Act actions brought in Federal district court if such actions grow out of the same transaction or occurrence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b133-7\">S.Rep. No. 99-345, at 16 (1986), <em>as reprinted in </em>1986 U.S.C.C.A.N. 5266, 5281. Thus, in plaintiffs\u2019 view, the provision was designed to <em>allow </em>state and local governments to join or intervene in federal FCA actions to assert state-law claims. <em>See United States ex rel. Long v. SCS Bus. &amp; Tech. Inst., Inc., </em>173 F.3d 870, 880 (D.C.Cir.1999) (It \u201cauthorizes permissive intervention by states for recovery of state funds.\u201d); <em>United States ex rel. Stevens v. Vermont Agency of Natural Resources, </em>162 F.3d 195, 205 (2d Cir.1998) (\u201canother 1986 amendment, ... permits the joinder, in an FCA suit, of related state-law claims where those claims are \u2018for the recovery of funds paid by a State.\u2019 \u201d) (quoting 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3732(b)), <em>overruled on other grounds, </em>529 U.S. 765, 120 S.Ct. 1858, 146 L.Ed.2d 836 (2000). It is unlikely that the NAAG would nag Congress to pass a provision that would strip states of their ability to bring state law claims in state court.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-8\">As mentioned before, five District courts have considered similar remand motions in response to Dey\u2019s removal of cases following the unsealing of the federal FCA action. Two courts specifically held that \u00a7 3732 does <em>not </em>grant the district court original jurisdiction, but rather grants supplemental jurisdiction. <em>See Alaska, </em>2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 38817, at *12 (\u201c \u00a7 3732(b) creates supplemental jurisdiction dependent upon the existence of original jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1345 if brought by the Attorney General or 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331 if brought by a private person.\u201d); <em>Hawaii, </em>469 F.Supp.2d at 851 (reviewing \u201cthe language of the statute, the legislative history, and the context in which it was enacted\u201d to conclude that \u00a7 3732(b) \u201cgrants the district courts not original jurisdiction, but supplemental jurisdiction\u201d). The remaining three District courts allowed the motion to remand based on a finding that defendants\u2019 removal was untimely, but noted that it is unlikely that \u00a7 3732(b) provides original jurisdiction. <em>See Wisconsin, </em>469 F.Supp.2d at 663 (finding it \u201cdoubtful\u201d that \u00a7 3732(b) provides original jurisdiction); <em>South Carolina, </em>2007 WL 1232156, at *2, 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 30983, at *7-8 (agreeing with the reasoning and conclusions of the Wisconsin court); <em>Alabama, </em>2006 WL 3170553, at *11, 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 80446, at *11 (finding that \u00a7 3732(b) \u201cappears to be a \u2018supplemental\u2019 jurisdictional statute\u201d). Defendants have not cited any cases concluding that 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3732(b) constitutes a basis of original federal subject-matter jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-9\">On balance, given the legislative history, the caselaw holding that \u00a7 3732 does not provide original jurisdiction is persuasive. Because supplemental jurisdiction is not a basis for removal, these cases should be remanded to their respective state courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>3. <em>Jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331 '</em></p>\n<p id=\"b134-4\">Dey makes the alternative argument that removal is proper under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331 which grants federal jurisdiction over \u201call civil actions arising under the Constitution, laws, or treaties of the United States.\u201d Dey contends that the Illinois state claim has been federalized by the federal government\u2019s simultaneous claim for 50 percent of the amount claimed by Illinois. In defendants\u2019 view, while Illinois\u2019 action may be premised on state law, Illinois seeks to recover the same damages from the same alleged scheme that is now at issue in the FCA claims asserted by the United States. It is true that Dey should not have to pay the same damages twice to two different governmental entities. However, the fact that a defendant\u2019s allegedly fraudulent conduct may give rise to both state and federal liability, does not federalize the state law claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-5\">Defendants\u2019 reliance on <em>Simms v. Roclan Energy Services, Inc., </em>137 F.Supp.2d 731, 734 (W.D.La.2001) is misplaced. The <em>Simms </em>case found that removal of state law injury claims suffered on an offshore platform was proper because federal jurisdiction was granted by the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act (\u201cOCSLA\u201d), 43 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331, et seq. The OCSLA specifically provides for the application of federal law to the outer continental shelf. 43 \u00a7 1333(a)(1). In addition, \u201cto fill the substantial \u2018gaps\u2019 in the coverage of federal law, OCSLA borrows the \u2018applicable and not inconsistent\u2019 laws of the adjacent States as surrogate federal law.\u201d <em>Gulf Offshore Co. v. Mobil Oil Corp., </em>453 U.S. 473, 480, 101 S.Ct. 2870, 69 L.Ed.2d 784 (1981). In contrast, \u00a7 3732(b) is a jurisdictional statute which does not purport to apply federal law, but rather provides access to the federal courts for certain actions \u201cbrought under the laws of any state.\u201d Jurisdictional statutes which seek \u201cto do nothing more than grant jurisdiction over a particular class of cases\u201d do not support \u201carising under\u201d jurisdiction. <em>Verlinden B.V. v. Cent. Bank of Nig., </em>461 U.S. 480, 496-97, 103 S.Ct. 1962, 76 L.Ed.2d 81 (1983). Section 3732(b) does not federalize the state law claims; it merely provides a federal forum where they can be pursued. Section 1331 does hot provide a proper basis of removal for defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-7\">B. <em>Removal Based on the MDL Court\u2019s Arizona Decision</em></p>\n<p id=\"b134-8\">The Illinois and Ohio defendants also renew their motion for removal based on the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Grable. </em>The complaints of Illinois and Ohio seek recovery of alleged overpayments made by Medicare Part B beneficiaries and the state Medicaid programs. On October 24, 2006, this Court issued a memorandum and decision in the AWP MDL which held that the State of Arizona\u2019s claim to recover Medicare Part B co-payments raises a substantial federal question under new Supreme Court precedent and denied the motion to remand. <em>See In re Pharm. Indus. Average Wholesale Price Litig., </em>457 F.Supp.2d at 82. In November of 2006, within thirty days of the Arizona decision, the defendants filed a motions for leave to file a supplemental notice of removal in the Northern District of Illinois and the Southern District of Ohio. In December of 2006 the Illinois case was transferred to this Court as part of the AWP MDL, followed by the Ohio case in February of 2007.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-9\">1. <em>Leave to File the Supplemental Notice</em></p>\n<p id=\"b134-10\">Before reaching the merits of this alternative ground for removal, the Court must determine whether it is appropriate to grant the leave to file the supplemental notice, and whether such notice was timely.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>Courts generally allow a defendant to amend a petition after the thirty day time limit for technical defects in the jurisdictional allegations, but not to add a new basis for federal jurisdiction. <em>See, e.g., Heller v. Allied Textile Cos., </em>276 F.Supp.2d 175, 180-81 (D.Me.2003); <em>see also Blakeley v. United Cable Sys., </em>105 F.Supp.2d 574, 579 (D.Miss.2000) (citing decisions that address this issue). The difference here, emphasized by the defendants, is that the substantive basis for removal did not exist until after the thirty days had expired.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-5\">Defendants rely on <em>Davis v. Life Investors Insurance Co. of America, Inc., </em>214 F.Supp.2d 691, 694 (S.D.Miss.2002) which appears to be the only case to address these particular circumstances. The <em>Davis </em>court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b135-6\">In each of the cases ... cited to the court by plaintiff or otherwise located by the court, courts have refused to allow amendment of the removal notice beyond the thirty-day period for removal where the ground for removal existed but was not asserted within the thirty-day removal period, for.in those eases, the failure to assert an existing basis for removal jurisdiction was viewed as a substantive defect. None of these cases addressed a situation such as is presented here, where there was no defect of any sort in the removal notice.... [T]his ground for removal/federal jurisdiction first arose while the case was pending in federal court after expiration of the thirty-day time limit for removal. In the court\u2019s opinion, in this circumstance, amendment of the notice of removal is permissible.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b135-7\"><em>Davis, </em>214 F.Supp.2d at 694. Given the similarity of the procedural posture here to that in the <em>Davis </em>case, I find that it is appropriate to allow the defendants to assert a supplemental notice of removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-8\">The new basis for removal arguably did not exist until after the initial thirty-day period. In fact, the Illinois defendants attempted to remove this case immediately following the <em>Grable </em>decision on June 13, 2005. On July 13, 2005, the Illinois defendants removed the case arguing that under <em>Grable </em>federal jurisdiction was proper due to the Medicare claims. This court found that the removal was untimely because <em>Grable </em>was not an \u201corder or other paper\u201d from which defendants could first ascertain that the state court actions were removable within the meaning of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1446(b) and thus allowed the motions to remand. <em>See In re Pharm. Indus. Average Wholesale Price Litig., </em>431 F.Supp.2d 98. In contrast, the Arizona defendants\u2019 removal based upon <em>Grable </em>was timely filed within thirty days of the initial pleading. <em>See In re Pharm. Indus. Average Wholesale Price Litig. </em>457 F.Supp.2d at 79. Not allowing defendants to supplement their removal notice would deny them the opportunity to ever assert the new grounds for removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-9\">2. <em>Timeliness of the Supplemental Notice</em></p>\n<p id=\"b135-10\">Once again, the defendants must still demonstrate that the supplemental notice of removal was timely filed. Here the defendants argue that the Arizona action is an \u201corder\u201d under \u00a7 1446(b) that restarts the clock for filing notice of removal. Defendants note that the Arizona case involved more than a dozen of the same defendants that are being sued in both the Illinois and Ohio cases. Furthermore, the factual circumstances are substantially the same and the legal issue, whether a claim on behalf of Medicare beneficiaries raises a federal question, is identical. In a prior disposition of this case, this Court highlighted the absence of exactly those factors when it found that <em>Grable </em>was not an \u201cother paper\u201d and thus found defendants\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>notice of removal untimely. <em>See In re Pharm. Indus. Average Wholesale Price Litig., </em>431 F.Supp.2d at 109 (\u201cUnlike the situations in <em>Doe </em>and <em>Green, Grable </em>and the AWP MDL do not involve the same defendants or similar factual issues.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b136-4\">The plaintiff states of Illinois and Ohio respond by arguing that defendants cannot satisfy two of the requirements laid out in <em>Doe. </em>First, the states contend that this Court is not a \u201ccourt superior in the same judicial hierarchy\u201d because it has no binding effect on the Illinois state or federal courts. While this is true, as the court handling the AWP MDL this court does exercise control over cases that have been transferred for pretrial proceedings.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Next, the states argue that the Arizona decision did not specifically authorize any defendant to remove any other action against it. This was a key requirement spelled out in Doe, which was glossed over in <em>Green. </em>Plaintiffs contend that ignoring this requirement would invite swarms of removal actions whenever an opinion is issued which could be viewed as a precedent.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-5\">The defendants are in an unfortunate situation. The key difference between the Arizona case, and the Illinois and Ohio cases, is that the Arizona complaint was filed much later such that the defendants raised <em>Grable </em>within the thirty-day removal timetable. In contrast, the Illinois and Ohio defendants could not raise the case within the thirty days.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> In Illinois, the defendants attempted removal within thirty days of the filing of <em>Grable, </em>but the Court rejected the argument that <em>Grable </em>was an \u201corder or other paper\u201d and found removal untimely. While the different status of the Arizona case and these two cases is due totally to the timing of the <em>Grable </em>case and no fault of defendants, allowing the defendants to use the Arizona case as a ladder into federal court would bypass the narrow exceptions permitted under section 1446(b). The Third and Fifth Circuit decisions were careful to limit them holdings to the \u201cvery narrow circumstances\u201d before them. <em>Green, </em>274 F.3d at 268. Permitting the decisions of this MDL Court to open new avenues of removal for related cases would repeatedly open the flood gates to new removal actions. It is inappropriate for this Court to further expand the scope of \u00a7 1446(b).
