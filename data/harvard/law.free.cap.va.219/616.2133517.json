Brooks Mims and his insurer, The Travelers Insurance Company, claiming workmen\u2019s compensation benefits on account of injuries sustained August 11, 1976 when he fell from a scaffold. The hearing commissioner ruled that McCoy was not an \u201cemployee\u201d within the coverage of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act. The full Commission reversed that ruling and awarded McCoy benefits. That ruling raises the only issue posed on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-11\">Mims, a farmer and livestock dealer, decided to remodel his riverfront cabin and adapt it to recreational use for his family and friends. He met McCoy and another carpenter at the cabin and explained the work he wanted done. This included the removal of certain partitions, the installation of sheetrock, insulation, panel-ling, and cabinets, and the addition of a screened porch. Plumbing and electrical work was to be done by other workers. A lump-sum contract was discussed, but the parties were unable to agree on the price. It was finally decided that the carpenters would be paid an hourly wage; that no taxes would be withheld from their paychecks; that they would choose their own work hours, keep their own time records, and use their own tools; and that Mims would furnish all materials and authorize the carpenters to purchase materials in his name.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number>Mims was the only person for whom McCoy had worked in 1976. During the two and one-half weeks McCoy worked before his accident, Mims visited the project almost daily, pointed out the work he wanted done, checked on its progress and the need for materials, and occasionally assisted the carpenters. Asked at the hearing if he had undertaken \u201cin any way to tell [McCoy] how to do that work\u201d or \u201cto supervise him at all as he did the work\u201d, Mims testified that he had not because he did not \u201cknow how to do any carpentry work.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b760-5\">Reciting these undisputed facts, the Commission found that Mims had retained \u201ccontrol\u201d over McCoy\u2019s work. Upon that finding, the Commission held that \u201cin determining the status of employee or independent contractor, the element of control is the most important [criterion]\u201d and that McCoy was Mims\u2019 employee and entitled to the benefits of the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-6\">Code \u00a7 65.1-4 defines \u201cemployee\u201d as \u201cevery person ... in the service of another under any contract of hire . . . except one whose employment is not in the usual course of the trade, business, occupation or profession of the employer. . . .\u201d Code \u00a7 65.1-28 provides that the Act \u201cshall not apply to . .. casual employees\u201d. Although Mims relied upon the definitional exception in a memorandum letter filed with the hearing commissioner, the Commission\u2019s decision made no reference to either statute. However, while the Commission did not expressly address the question whether McCoy\u2019s employment was in the usual course of Mims\u2019 occupation or the question whether McCoy was a casual employee, both questions were necessarily subsumed in and adjudicated by the Commission\u2019s holding that McCoy was a covered employee.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-7\">We do not agree that the Commission\u2019s holding was a finding of fact binding upon this Court. When the evidence concerning what constitutes the \u201cusual course\u201d of the employer\u2019s trade, business, occupation, or profession or the \u201ccasualness\u201d of the claimant\u2019s work is in conflict, it raises a question of fact. When, as here, there is no such conflict, what constitutes a covered employee is a question of law. <em>See Stonega C.&amp;C. Co. </em>v. <em>Sutherland, </em>136 Va. 489, 494, 118 S.E. 133, 134 (1923).</p>\n<p id=\"b760-8\">McCoy cites a case in which the claimant, whose work was <em>both </em>casual and outside the usual course of the employer\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"619\">*619</page-number>business, was found to be excluded from the Act. <em>Board of Supervisors </em>v. <em>Boaz, </em>176 Va. 126, 10 S.E. 2d 498 (1940). <em>Boaz </em>did not hold, however, that a claimant is excluded from the Act <em>only </em>when his work was both casual <em>and </em>outside the usual course of the employer\u2019s business.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-5\">In <em>Hoffer Bros. </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>148 Va. 220, 226, 138 S.E. 474, 476 (1927), we said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b761-6\">An employment cannot be said to be casual where it is in the usual course of the trade, business or occupation of the employer. But it is casual when not permanent nor periodically regular, but occasional, or by chance, <em>and </em>not in the usual course of the employer\u2019s trade or business, (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b761-7\">The effect of this holding was explicated in Boaz:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b761-8\">[T]he claimant was a casual employee, but, under the holding of this court in <em>Hoffer Bros. </em>v. <em>Smith, . . </em>. this does not defeat his claim if such employment was in the usual course of the trade, business, occupation or profession of the employer.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b761-9\">176 Va. at 129, 10 S.E.2d at 499.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-10\">The logical corollary is that, even though a claimant is not a casual employee, he is excluded from coverage of the Act unless the work he did was in the usual course of the trade, business, occupation, or profession of the employer.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-11\">It may be fair to say that McCoy\u2019s work was not casual and that Mims retained control over the work product (as distinguished from work methods). But all the evidence shows that the work McCoy did was in no way connected with Mims\u2019 usual occupation, and we hold that the Commission erred in ruling that McCoy was an employee covered by the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-12\">The Commission\u2019s order will be reversed, the award will be vacated, and final judgment will be entered here for Mims and his insurer.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-13\">\n<em>Reversed and final judgment.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
