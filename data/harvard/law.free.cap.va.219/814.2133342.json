We granted a writ of error to consider defendant\u2019s claim that the trial court committed reversible error in admitting hearsay testimony and in refusing defendant\u2019s instruction on accomodation distribution.</p>\n<p id=\"b957-11\">We consider the evidence in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth. James Weston, arrested on a narcotics charge, agreed to cooperate with the police in their investigation of drug traffic in Fairfax County. Weston approached defendant in a corridor of the courthouse and inquired if he knew where he could buy heroin or dilaudid. Defendant told him he could get a prescription from a doctor, Dr. Salama, who was present in the courthouse, but \u201cit would cost him a hundred dollars.\u201d Defendant asked Weston to \u201cloan\u201d him $100 to pay Salama for the prescription and a bill he owed for earlier treatments. Weston refused but, hoping to \u201chelp\u201d his own case, left the courthouse and contacted Detective Guy Morgan.</p>\n<p id=\"b957-12\">Morgan gave Weston six marked twenty-dollar bills, five of which Weston handed to defendant. Defendant passed the five bills to Salama who wrote a prescription for dilaudid in defendant\u2019s name. Defendant and Weston drove to a nearby pharmacy, followed in another car by Morgan. The cost of filling the prescription was $3.45. Weston understood that he was to get several pills with a \u201cstreet value of approximately a hundred dollars.\u201d Sitting in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"816\">*816</page-number>the car with Weston, defendant poured the pills into his hand and showed them to Weston. Weston testified that \u201c[h]e was starting to pass me two or three pills. I had my hand out... \u201d At this point, the detective reached into the car and, as defendant made a motion toward his mouth, grabbed his hand and told him not to attempt to swallow the pills.</p>\n<p id=\"b958-5\">On cross-examination, Weston acknowledged the conversation about a loan and agreed that defendant had never expressly \u201ctold\u201d him he would get some of the drugs. He testified, however, that \u201cit was an understanding ... he would get some, I would get some; I thought I was going to get the major portion.\u201d Throughout his testimony, defendant maintained that the transaction was nothing but a loan; that the prescription was intended solely to treat his own health problem; and that Weston \u201cwasn\u2019t to get any of those pills.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b958-6\">Defendant\u2019s hearsay objection was addressed to the following portion of Detective Morgan\u2019s testimony:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b958-7\">A. The conversation between Weston and I was about Weston was to receive or to give one hundred dollars to an individual known as Windy Schindel. For this one hundred dollars Schindel was to receive a prescription from a Dr. Salama and the prescription was for thirty dilaudid tablets.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b958-8\">Defendant argues that Morgan was reciting what Weston had told him, and that in doing so, he \u201cwas trying to make out a prima facie case of intent to distribute, where Weston had failed to do so\u201d. Defendant overlooks the plain import of the following extract from Weston\u2019s testimony:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b958-9\">A. I approached Mr. Schindel in a friendly manner and I asked him if he knew where I could purchase any particular type drugs, heroin or dilaudid.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b958-10\">Q. What, if anything, did Mr. Schindel say in response to that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b959-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"817\">*817</page-number>A. He said yes, he knew where he could get some dilaudid. And he stated that there was a doctor in the Courthouse that he could give a certain amount of money to and get a prescription.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b959-5\">Q. Was there any mention of money at that time?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b959-6\">A. There was mention of Mr. Schindel told me he\u2019d need a hundred dollars to get the prescription from the doctor in the Courthouse.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b959-7\">Q. What, if any, understanding was there between you and Mr. Schindel in regard to the one hundred dollars?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b959-8\">A. Basically that the prescription would be mine. Is that what you\u2019re asking?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b959-9\">Q. What, if anything, was Mr. Schindel to get for this transaction?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b959-10\">A. A few pills, dilaudids.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b959-11\">Thus, Weston\u2019s testimony in court proves the essence of the content of his extra-judicial declaration. In further verification of the content of that declaration, Morgan later testified that he \u201cadvised Weston . . . the way we would have to handle the case\u201d and outlined to him the plan for paying the money, obtaining the prescription, and getting \u201ca certain amount of the dilaudid\u201d into Weston\u2019s hands. Defendant concedes that this portion of Morgan\u2019s testimony was competent. Moreover, while defendant denies any intent to give Weston any of the pills, his own testimony corroborates the factual details of Weston\u2019s declaration to Morgan.</p>\n<p id=\"b959-12\">Even though testimony is objectionable as hearsay, its admission is harmless error when the content of the extra-judicial declaration is clearly established by other competent evidence. <em>Facchina </em>v. <em>Richardson and Rains, </em>213 Va. 440, 443, 192 S.E.2d 791, 794 (1972). Applying that rule and considering all the evidence properly before the jury, we hold that any error in admitting the challenged testimony was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b959-13\">Defendant offered the following instruction:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b960-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"818\">*818</page-number>If you believe from the evidence that the defendant <em>distributed </em>dilaudid only as an accommodation to Joseph Weston and not with intent to profit thereby nor to induce the recipient to use or become addicted to or dependent upon such drug, then you shall find the defendant guilty and fix his punishment at a maximum of one (1) year in jail or a One Thousand Dollar fine, (emphasis added).*</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b960-5\">Refusing the instruction, the trial court said, \u201cHe is not charged with distribution; he is charged with possession with intent to distribute.\u201d Defendant voiced no objection to the court\u2019s ruling or the reason underlying it.</p>\n<p id=\"b960-6\">Where there is sufficient evidence to support a requested instruction defining the offense of possession with intent to make an accomodation distribution, the request should be granted. Here, defendant made no such request and identified no evidence in support of such an instruction. Under these circumstances, we find no error in the trial court\u2019s ruling, and the judgment will be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b960-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b960-8\"><em> </em>The penalty for conviction of possession with intent to make an accommodation distribution of dilaudid, a Class 5 felony, Code \u00a7 18.2-248(a), is \u201ca term of imprisonment of not less than one year nor more than ten years, or ... confinement in jail for not more than twelve months and a fine of not more than one thousand dollars, either or both.\u201d Code \u00a7 18.2-10(e).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
