In light of the mitigating circumstances disclosed by the evidence and defendant\u2019s prior good reputation, the trial court suspended imposition of sentence and placed Cook on supervised probation.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-11\">We granted a writ of error to review defendant\u2019s challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence to sustain his conviction. Cook argues that the evidence at trial was deficient in two respects, namely:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b912-12\">(1) the evidence failed to establish that defendant used more force than was reasonably necessary to repel an attack on defendant by the decedent; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b912-13\">(2) the evidence failed to show, beyond a reasonable doubt, any causal connection between the injuries inflicted on the deceased by defendant on August 1,1977, and the deceased\u2019s subsequent death on August 19.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b912-14\">When the sufficiency of the evidence is challenged after conviction, it is our duty to consider it in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth and give it all reasonable inferences fairly deducible therefrom. We should affirm the judgment unless it appears from the evidence that the judgment is plainly wrong or without evidence to support it. <em>Higginbotham </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>216 Va. 349, 352, 218 S.E.2d 534, 537 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b913-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"771\">*771</page-number>Viewed in light of these principles, the record shows that the deceased, who had been drinking intoxicating beverages, and defendant engaged in an argument at the home of defendant\u2019s mother, Ann Cook, on August 1,1977. As this argument progressed, it became more heated. Both defendant and his mother testified that the deceased grabbed the front of defendant\u2019s shirt and struck defendant on the arm. Defendant retaliated by striking Boswell several times with his fist about the head and face.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-5\">Immediately after this altercation Boswell\u2019s face began to discolor and swell. Within a short time Boswell\u2019s face became badly swollen. Defendant and his mother applied an ice pack to Boswell\u2019s injuries but Boswell refused defendant\u2019s offer to assist in obtaining medical attention. Boswell, who continued to refuse medical attention, remained at Ann Cook\u2019s home, attended by Mrs. Cook, until the early morning hours of August 3. Boswell\u2019s daughter, granddaughter and son-in-law visited Boswell and observed his condition on Tuesday, August 2. On that occasion Mrs. Cook told Boswell\u2019s daughter that defendant struck Boswell only three times. She also said that Boswell was badly bruised because defendant was wearing his class ring. Around 5:30 A.M. on August 3, Mrs. Cook called Boswell\u2019s son-in-law and told him that Boswell was not responding to her care. A rescue squad ambulance was called and Boswell was transported to a hospital. Upon his arrival there, Boswell was lethargic and hard to arouse. He had contusions \u201call over the face, part of the chest, the abdomen and the right lower leg\u201d, and his eyes were \u201cpartially closed\u201d because of facial swelling. When tests showed Boswell had a blood clot in the right temporal lobe of his brain, surgery was performed to remove the clot. Boswell never regained consciousness and died on August 19.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-6\">Until about two years before the altercation between Boswell and defendant, Boswell and defendant\u2019s mother had resided together intermittently for several years in a meretricious relationship at Ann Cook\u2019s home in Danville. Mrs. Cook testified that she attempted to terminate this relationship and had, on numerous occasions during the two year period, told Boswell not to come to her home or to attempt to see her. She related that Boswell refused to surrender keys to her home and car and continued to come to her home and to use her car in spite of her contrary wishes.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-7\">Mrs. Cook described Boswell as a heavy drinker who was very possessive, harsh and abrupt. When \u201cdrinking\u201d, Boswell frequently became violent and aggressive. Mrs. Cook\u2019s evidence in this respect was not challenged.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"772\">*772</page-number>Mrs. Cook also testified that Boswell, while attempting to go to the bathroom early Wednesday morning, August 3, fell and struck his head against a bed and the hardwood floor in the bedroom.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-5\">Defendant, who was 22 years of age, married and residing in his own home, was aware of his mother\u2019s desire to terminate her relationship with Boswell. He had spoken to Boswell on several occasions preceding the altercation, requesting that Boswell stay away from Mrs. Cook\u2019s residence unless invited there by Mrs. Cook. Defendant testified that he was afraid of Boswell and was aware of Boswell\u2019s reputation as a violent and aggressive person. He also knew that Boswell had committed an unlawful violent homicide in Roanoke County in 1968 or 1969. Defendant testified that Boswell had threatened him with harm on several occasions.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-6\">Boswell was 62 years of age and weighed approximately 230 pounds. He had suffered from hypertension (high blood pressure) for more than two years prior to his death and had an advanced case of cirrhosis, a progressive liver disease. The medical evidence shows that one who suffers from cirrhosis is susceptible to more than normal bleeding, bruising and swelling because one of the side effects of the disease is to reduce the ability of the blood to coagulate.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-7\">Ronald D. Pruitt, a member of the rescue squad which transported Boswell to the hospital, testified that Boswell was \u201cbadly beaten\u201d, \u201c[h]is face was bruised very much, it had dried blood on it, swollen severely.\u201d When Pruitt asked how Boswell sustained his injuries, Mrs. Cook responded that Boswell \u201chad been beaten by her son.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b914-8\">Detective J. W. Martin, Jr., of the Danville Police Department, testified that he went to the Ann Cook residence on Wednesday, August 3, to interview Mrs. Cook. During this interview defendant, who was also present, told Detective Martin that he would like to tell him \u201cwhat happened\u201d. After being advised of his <em>Miranda </em>rights, defendant told the detective that he and Boswell, who was drinking heavily, \u201cgot into an argument and [Boswell] tried to hit [defendant]; [defendant] lost his temper severely and struck [Boswell] five times.\u201d Defendant also said \u201cafter he struck [Boswell] he noticed that [Boswell\u2019s] face swelled up severely and that he became unconscious and was snoring as if he was asleep.\u201d Later in the same conversation defendant said \u201che knew that he had lost his temper and when he struck [Boswell] he knew he had done wrong.\u201d Detective Martin also testified that Mrs. Cook told him that Boswell had fallen while attempting to go to the bathroom <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"773\">*773</page-number>around 2:30 A.M. on Tuesday, August 2, not on Wednesday, August 3, as she had testified at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-5\">Dr. David W. Oxley, Deputy Chief Medical Examiner for Western Virginia, testified that he performed an autopsy on Boswell\u2019s body the day after his death. Oxley\u2019s examination revealed several small \u201cdiscreet\u201d bruises on the left cheek and a large bruise on the right cheekbone. Dr. Oxley also observed a large bruise on the right upper front of the shoulder, another large bruise on the upper left abdomen at the margin of the rib cage and still another \u201cfading purplish\u201d bruise on the front part of the right lower leg. There were no fractures present in the ribs, vertebrae or skull. Examination of the liver revealed cirrhosis of \u201cfairly long standing\u201d. When the head was opened, Dr. Oxley found the brain to be \u201cquite swollen\u201d. He examined the area where an intracerebral blood clot had been evacuated by surgery, and found evidence of new bleeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-6\">Dr. Oxley was of opinion that the bruises on the cheeks were caused by \u201crepeated blows to the area of the face rather than a fall\u201d and that Boswell\u2019s death was caused by \u201cmultiple blunt force injuries to the head with intracranial and cerebral contusions and hemorrhage, terminally complicated by liver failure.\u201d On cross-examination, Dr. Oxley testified that it was not unusual for trauma of the type sustained by Boswell to cause an intracerebral hemorrhage.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-7\">With this evidence in mind, we will now deal with defendant\u2019s first argument, that the evidence failed to show defendant used excessive force to repel an attack by the deceased.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-8\">Recognizing the well-established principle that one assaulted may use only such force as appears to him reasonably necessary to repel the attack, defendant argues that evidence disclosing that, when attacked, he \u201cstruck the deceased some 3 to 5 times very quickly with his fists\u201d, was insufficient to establish the use of excessive force. He further argues that Boswell\u2019s appearance and his battered condition were explained by Boswell\u2019s subsequent fall and the medical evidence which showed that Boswell, suffering from advanced cirrhosis, would bruise more easily and swell more readily than a normal person sustaining the same trauma.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-9\">While this evidence was relevant and could be properly considered by the trial court, the court was not required to give full credit to the evidence or defendant\u2019s interpretation of it. This is particularly so in view of the other evidence showing Boswell\u2019s battered condition and the expert opinion that his injuries were not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"774\">*774</page-number>caused by a fall, but by repeated blows about the face. In addition there were defendant\u2019s statements that he \u201clost his temper severely\u201d and \u201cwhen he struck [Boswell] he knew he had done wrong.\u201d Most certainly, his mother\u2019s testimony at trial concerning Boswell\u2019s condition after the altercation and that his condition markedly changed after his subsequent fall is not consistent with her statement to Pruitt, the ambulance attendant, that Boswell\u2019s injuries were sustained when he was \u201cbeaten by her son\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-5\">Upon consideration of all the evidence, we find no error in the trial court\u2019s finding that defendant used excessive force to repel Boswell\u2019s attack.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-6\">This brings us to the second point advanced by defendant, that the evidence failed to show, beyond a reasonable doubt, any causal connection between the injuries inflicted by defendant and Boswell\u2019s subsequent death.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-7\">While the medical evidence on this issue was not without conflict, the evidence of Dr. Oxley, set forth above, supports a finding of the necessary causal connection. Since there is credible evidence to sustain its holding, the trial court did not err in this respect, so the judgment of the trial court will be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-8\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
