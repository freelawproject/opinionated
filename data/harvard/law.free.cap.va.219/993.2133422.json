In a lengthy letter opinion, the chancellor found that the standard of living during coverture was \u201cmodest\u201d; that husband gave wife \u201caround $650 per month apparently for food, clothing . . . and running the house, which at that time involved two growing boys\u201d; that the $18,000 in net proceeds from the sale of the $30,000 marital residence had been divided equally; that wife was 48 years of age, suffered \u201ca number of physical ailments,\u201d and because of her \u201clack of skills\u201d was \u201cunable to engage in any significant gainful employment\u201d; that wife\u2019s statement of monthly expenses of $1,733.75 \u201cshows some rather high items\u201d and other items which \u201cmay be desirable, but do not seem essential\u201d; that husband\u2019s statement of monthly expenses of $1,791.74 included some items which \u201care not properly available to him\u201d; that husband\u2019s average gross annual income for the last six years was $39,146; that husband owned 45% of the $337,950 stockholders\u2019 equity in a retail clothing corporation; and that husband\u2019s deceased mother had created a $200,000 testamentary trust under which the trustees \u201chave \u2018... absolute and uncontrolled discretion . . .\u2019 to pay income or principal to [husband] as they \u2018deem appropriate ...\u2019 [and to]... terminate the trust at any time during [husband\u2019s] lifetime and pay the entire amount over to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"995\">*995</page-number>him.\u201d The mother\u2019s will, introduced as an exhibit, further granted husband a testamentary power of appointment of the trust corpus and provided that, if he failed to exercise the power, the corpus would pass to his children.</p>\n<p id=\"b1137-5\">The wife was awarded attorneys\u2019 fees of $7,500, costs of $1,121.18, and \u201c$800 per month as support, beginning January 1, 1977\u201d. The decree then provided the following which the parties refer to as the \u201cescalator clause\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1137-6\">Further as support, it is ADJUDGED and ORDERED that the defendant pay 25% of all income received by him in any calendar year beginning with 1977 in excess of $32,000; income to include but not be limited to earnings from interest, dividends, as well as beneficiary of any trust.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1137-7\">The courts of this Commonwealth are empowered to assess spousal support awards, not to penalize or reward either party to the marriage contract, but rather to do equity between the two and to protect society\u2019s interests in the incidents of the marital relationship. Code \u00a7 20-107 defines several standards for balancing the respective needs and capacities of the husband and wife. The balance must be struck and awards made \u201cupon the basis of the circumstances disclosed by the evidence at the time of the award.\u201d <em>Thomas </em>v. <em>Thomas, </em>217 Va. 502, 505, 229 S.E 2d 887, 889-90 (1976). Code \u00a7 20-109 grants courts continuing jurisdiction to modify awards \u201cwhere changed circumstances are demonstrated\u201d. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b1137-8\">This statutory scheme recognizes that comparative needs and capacities change as circumstances change, that changes are not fairly predictable, and that spousal support awards must be determined in light of contemporary circumstances and then, if necessary, redetermined in light of new circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b1137-9\">In determining the obligor\u2019s ability to pay, courts are authorized by Code \u00a7 20-107 to consider not only earnings but also \u201cearning capacity\u201d. But in doing so, \u201cit is not proper to consider what [the obligor] might ultimately receive\u201d as a \u2018\u201cpotential recipient\u2019 of a share of [a trust] fund\u201d. <em>Robertson </em>v. <em>Robertson, </em>215 Va. 425, 428, 211 S.E.2d 41, 44 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b1137-10\">While the <em>Robertson </em>award was fashioned to take effect in the present and the Jacobs escalator clause in the future, both were premised upon the occurrence of an uncertain future cir<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"996\">*996</page-number>cumstance. An award so premised ignores the design and defeats the purpose of the statutory scheme.</p>\n<p id=\"b1138-5\">The decree will be reversed and the cause remanded for entry of a new decree which does not include the escalator clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b1138-6\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
