Upon receipt of these records, the attorney for the Commonwealth, complying with the mandatory provisions of Code \u00a7 46.1-387.4, filed an information in the trial court against Davis. The trial court, as provided by Code \u00a7 46.1-387.5, entered an order requiring Davis to appear at a designated time to show cause why he should not be barred from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"811\">*811</page-number>operating a motor vehicle on the highways of Virginia, in accordance with the provisions of Code \u00a7 46.1-387.2.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b953-5\">At the hearing in the trial court, the Commonwealth\u2019s sole evidence consisted of the certified transcripts or abstracts of Davis\u2019s convictions. Davis moved to strike the evidence on the ground that the Commonwealth had failed to prove that the North Carolina and South Carolina laws under which he had been convicted \u201csubstantially conformed\u201d to the comparable Virginia statutes. (Code \u00a7\u00a7 18.2-266, <em>et seq.).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b953-6\">After taking the matter under advisement, the trial court ruled that in a habitual offender proceeding, a civil matter, the burden of going forward with evidence on any defenses is on the defendant. Hence, the court held that Davis had the burden of going forward with evidence on the issue of the conformity of the foreign laws to their Virginia counterpart. By final order, the court found Davis to be a habitual offender under Code \u00a7 46.1-387.2, prohibited him from operating a motor vehicle on the highways of Virginia for a period of ten years and until his privilege to do so has been restored by a court of competent jurisdiction, and directed him to surrender his licenses and permits.</p>\n<p id=\"b953-7\">Davis concedes the validity of his convictions in North Carolina and South Carolina, and of the subsequent revocation of his operator\u2019s permit by administrative act of the Commissioner. He contends, however, that the burden was on the Commonwealth in the present proceeding to prove the substantial conformity of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"812\">*812</page-number>North Carolina and South Carolina laws, under which he was convicted, with Code \u00a7 18.2-266. <em>See Scott </em>v. <em>Hill, </em>407 F. Supp. 301, 302 (1976) (referring to a decision of the Circuit Court of the City of Virginia Beach which supports Davis\u2019s contention). Legislative intent to require the Commonwealth to prove conformity must be inferred, Davis argues, from the omission from Code \u00a7 46.1-387.3 of any language to the contrary. Under that section the transcripts or abstracts of convictions are prima facie evidence that the person therein named was duly convicted, or held not innocent if a juvenile, of the offenses listed, and the burden of proof is expressly shifted to the person denying any of the stated facts. Davis concedes that this provision creates a presumption in respect to the accuracy of the certified records, but he contends that this presumption does not extend to the substantial conformance issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b954-4\">Subject to the exception set forth in \u00a7 46.1-387.3, as to which we express no opinion, the burden of proof under the Act is upon the Commonwealth and is not shifted by the show cause order. <em>Willis </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>190 Va. 294, 56 S.E.2d 222 (1949). In the present case, however, we are concerned not with the burden of proof but with the burden of going forward with the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b954-5\">The purpose of the Habitual Offender Act is to promote highway safety by denying the privilege of operating motor vehicles to those persons \u201cwho by their conduct and record\u201d have demonstrated their lack of concern for the safety of others and their disrespect for law and authority. Code \u00a7 46.1-387.1. The Act is civil in nature and does not violate any provisions of the United States or Virginia Constitutions. <em>McIntosh </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>213 Va. 330, 333, 191 S.E.2d 791, 793-794 (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b954-6\">Proceedings under the Act are based upon records which the Commissioner is required to maintain. A copy of the certified transcripts or abstracts of convictions must be served on the defendant with a copy of the show cause order. Under \u00a7 46.1-387.2 offenses triggering the operative provisions of the Act include offenses under a law of another state substantially conforming to our law. Hence, the Commissioner is required to maintain a record for Virginia motor vehicle operators showing convictions not only under Code \u00a7 18.2-266 but also under similar laws of other states. We believe that it is reasonable to presume that under the statutory scheme of the Habitual Offender Act the Commissioner not only kept accurate records of Davis\u2019s convictions but that he also made at least a tentative determination of similarity between the Virginia statute and the laws of the other two states. We <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"813\">*813</page-number>conclude that the effect of the interrelated provisions of the Act is to create a prima facie presumption that the convictions obtained in other states as shown on the certified transcripts or abstracts were not only valid but were obtained under laws substantially conforming to our own. The show cause order did not shift the burden of proof to Davis, but it did shift to him the burden of going forward with evidence to rebut the presumption that the Act applied to his out-of-state convictions which were listed on the certified transcripts or abstracts.</p>\n<p id=\"b955-5\">Under Code \u00a7 8.01-386, whenever it becomes necessary in a civil action to ascertain what the law of another state was at any time, the trial court \u201cshall\u201d take judicial notice thereof. However, since Davis did not challenge the similarity between \u00a7 18.2-266 and the laws under which he was convicted, it was unnecessary for the trial court to comply with the provisions of \u00a7 8.01-386.</p>\n<p id=\"b955-6\">The judgment will be</p>\n<p id=\"b955-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b952-6\"> Code \u00a7 46.1-387.3.
