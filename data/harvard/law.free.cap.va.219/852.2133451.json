Barrett, Jr. In accordance with the verdict the trial court sentenced Jordan to the state penitentiary for five years. We granted a writ of error limited solely to a consideration of the trial court\u2019s refusal to admit certain testimony concerning Barrett\u2019s reputation for violence.</p>\n<p id=\"b995-5\">On August 6, 1977, Barrett and a number of other persons were gambling in a residence located in Richmond. The defendant Jordan arrived on the scene around 1 a. m. Barrett testified that he had lost his money and therefore offered Jordan his place at the dice table. He said that when he was a little slow in moving, Jordan said to him, \u201c[Mjove your monkey a.. out the way.\u201d Barrett stated that when Jordan addressed the same remark to him a second time, he asked the defendant, \u201c[W]ho do you think you are that you can talk to people that way?\u201d, to which the defendant replied, \u201c[Yjou\u2019ll find out who I am.\u201d To this remark Barrett said he replied, \u201c[I]f you are going to do something to me... you can forget it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b995-6\">Barrett\u2019s testimony was that after this exchange of words, he forgot about the argument because \u201c[Tjhere wasn\u2019t nothing to it.\u201d He said, however, that Jordan left and returned a few minutes later with a pistol. Barrett testified that the defendant walked up to him and said \u201c[Y]ou say the same thing you said to me that you said before\u201d, and then threatened \u201cto blow [Barrett\u2019s] m.....f..... head off\u201d. Barrett testified that he replied, \u201cI didn\u2019t know you were that mad about this . . . [I]t ain\u2019t worth killing for.\u201d At this point Barrett said Jordan shot him twice, one bullet striking his arm and the other his mouth. The victim, who was unarmed, claims that he was seated at the time he was shot.</p>\n<p id=\"b995-9\">The defendant\u2019s version of the incident is that he and Barrett had had confrontations on previous occasions. He testified that he knew that he was \u201cno match for him [Barrett]\u201d, and that he had heard Barrett \u201ctell people he could take his fists and break people\u2019s jaws\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b995-10\">Jordan admitted arguing with Barrett on the night of the shooting. He said that he apologized three times and told the victim, \u201cI\u2019m very sorry that I said anything to you. You can have this spot right back there.\u201d Defendant said that he then left the house with the intention of going home; that after he left he \u201cwas going on about my business when all of sudden my mind told me to go back in there and to try to straighten this out because it\u2019s going <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"854\">*854</page-number>to start somewhere else and somebody is going to get into trouble. I had the pistol all the time. . . .\u201d He testified that when someone opened the back door he entered with the gun at his side. With reference to the gun, defendant said, \u201cI\u2019m hiding it because I don\u2019t want him to sure enough, to get jumped, but I am thinking about protecting myself because, you know, if I come down wrong, he\u2019s going to jump me ... [a]nd tear me to pieces if he gets his hands on me.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b996-5\">When asked why he had the gun, defendant answered, \u201cI had the weapon by my side because of the fact that I know that if I go back in there talking to John, I can\u2019t reason with him, but I want to try to reason with him, and it\u2019s as simple as that. I\u2019m not taking no chances with him because I have bad nerves, and I know damn near as well he\u2019s going to jump me.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b996-6\">The defendant testified that after he reentered the building, an acquaintance, John Bledsoe, told him, \u201c[Djon\u2019t get in no trouble because you are getting married in two weeks, and it ain\u2019t worth it.\u201d Jordan said he replied to Bledsoe, \u201cJohn, this man is looking for trouble\u201d and that before he got the words out of his mouth Barrett jumped out of the chair, hit the gun and in some way got shot. Defendant admitted that prior to the shooting, John Bledsoe \u201ctried to keep me under control\u201d, and that he said to Bledsoe, \u201cI\u2019m tired of this man keeping on bugging me. We\u2019ve got to get some understanding.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b996-7\">Defendant testified that the shooting was an accident, saying, \u201c[Wjhen he leaped up on me, you understand that my reaction called for the gun to go right off at him, you know. I mean he caused himself to get shot like that in that incident.\u201d However, the defendant said that he resented being called a boy by Barrett, that \u201cI\u2019m not no boy like he called me. Both of us is men. I couldn\u2019t reason with him without a gun.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b996-8\">Samuel L. Jackson, who was at the scene, described Barrett as a big man. He testified that immediately before the shooting occurred Jordan said to Barrett, \u201cSay what you said before\u201d, that Barrett\u2019s response to Jordan was, \u201c[Ajll right, you got me now\u201d, after which Barrett got up and walked toward the defendant. Jackson said that when the first shot was fired the parties were so close together \u201cthey was almost kissing each other\u201d. However, John Bledsoe estimated that the parties were six feet apart when the gun went off. Bledsoe also testified that defendant\u2019s gun never left Jordan\u2019s side and at all times remained \u201cpointed the way Barrett was sitting.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b997-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"855\">*855</page-number>Counsel for defendant sought to introduce evidence of Barrett\u2019s reputation for violence. The trial court refused to admit such evidence upon the ground that Jordan repeatedly said that the shooting was an accident and was not done in self-defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b997-5\">It is well settled in Virginia that where an accused adduces evidence that he acted in self-defense, evidence of specific acts is admissible to show the character of the victim for turbulence and violence, even if the accused is unaware of such character. <em>Barnes </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, 214 </em>Va. 24, 197 S.E.2d 189 (1973); <em>Stover </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>211 Va. 789, 180 S.E.2d 504 (1971); <em>Randolph </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>190 Va. 256, 56 S.E.2d 226 (1949). We held in <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>196 Va. 10, 15, 82 S.E.2d 482, 485 (1954), that \u201c[T]he evidence and inferences deducible therefrom may be such at times as to justify the submission of whether or not the killing was in self-defense, as well as whether or not it was accidental\u201d. However, the case under review is not such a case.</p>\n<p id=\"b997-6\">A review of the evidence discloses no overt act on the part of Barrett that would justify a plea of self-defense by the defendant. While there is evidence that prior to the night- of the shooting Barrett and Jordan may have had several \u201cconfrontations\u201d, these confrontations were of little significance. Insults and threats may have been exchanged but no physical attacks had previously been made by either party on the other. On the night of the shooting the parties again had \u201cwords\u201d but no fight resulted therefrom. It is clear from defendant\u2019s testimony that after he had left the house in which the gambling was taking place, his resentment of Barrett prompted him to return with a loaded revolver and to address a taunting remark to his victim. Jordan admitted that he needed the gun so that he could \u201creason\u201d with Barrett.</p>\n<p id=\"b997-7\">Jordan went back into the dwelling from a place of safety with the avowed intention of having a further confrontation with Barrett. Barrett was unarmed and, prior to Jordan\u2019s appearance with the gun, made no aggressive gesture toward the defendant. It was the defendant who renewed the quarrel and who brought on the affray by his provocative act of pointing the pistol in Barrett\u2019s direction, an act most certainly calculated to precipitate the difficulty that ensued.</p>\n<p id=\"b997-8\">In <em>Sims </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>134 Va. 736, 115 S.E. 382 (1922), we applied the principle that a person cannot rely upon a plea of self-defense in a case of homicide or assault when he himself was the aggressor and wilfully brought on, without legal excuse, the necessity for the homicide or assault. There we said: \u201cA man <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"856\">*856</page-number>cannot go a-gunning for an adversary and kill him on the first appearance of resistance, and rely upon the necessity of the killing as an excuse therefor.\u201d 134 Va. at 760, 115 S.E. at 390.</p>\n<p id=\"b998-5\">The conclusion is inescapable that in the instant case Jordan regarded the gun with which he was armed as the \u201cequalizer\u201d between himself and Barrett, a larger man, and that when he went into the building the second time he went \u201ca-gunning\u201d for his adversary.</p>\n<p id=\"b998-6\">Accordingly, we find no error in the action of the court in refusing to permit the defendant to introduce testimony regarding Barrett\u2019s reputation for violence.</p>\n<p id=\"b998-7\">The judgment of the lower court is</p>\n<p id=\"b998-8\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
