The offenses are (1) the operation of a motor vehicle \u201cequipped with\u201d such a device, (2) the use of such a device upon a motor vehicle, and (3) the sale of any such device.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-6\">Each of the four cases involves a \u201cradar detector\u201d observed by police on the dashboard of a motor vehicle operated by a particular appellant. At the time, none of the devices was in use. Hence, we shall consider only the \u201cequipped with\u201d portion of \u00a7 46.1-198.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-7\">The appellants advance numerous arguments to support reversal of their convictions. As a threshold proposition, they contend that, pursuant to the Supremacy Clause of the United States Constitution and by the enactment of the Communications Act of 1934, 47 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 151 <em>et seq., </em>Congress has preempted the field of radio communication and, therefore, the General Assembly was precluded from enacting \u00a7 46.1-198.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>We find this contention without merit. In <em>Head </em>v. New <em>Mexico Board, </em>374 U.S. 424, 430 (1963), in upholding state action against a claim of preemption under the Communications Act, the Supreme Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b183-5\">\u201cIn areas of the law not inherently requiring national uniformity, our decisions are clear in requiring that state statutes, othewise valid, must be upheld unless there is found \u2018such actual conflict between the two schemes of regulation that both cannot stand in the same area, [or] evidence of a congressional design to preempt the field\u2019\u201d (footnote and citation omitted).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b183-6\">See also <em>Florida Avocado Growers v. Paul, </em>373 U.S. 132, 142 (1963), and <em>Kroeger </em>v. <em>Stahl, </em>248 F.2d 121, 123 (3d Cir. 1957).</p>\n<p id=\"b183-7\">Here, we find no conflict between the prohibition of Code \u00a7 46.1-198.1 and the federal regulatory system established by the Communications Act. Except for a reference to the general purpose of the Act \u201cto make available, so far as possible, to all the people ... a rapid, efficient... radio communication service,\u201d 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 151, the appellants have not cited any federal regulation which would even remotely indicate that \u201cboth [systems] cannot stand in the same area\u201d or that the regulatory field has been preempted, so that all state action is forbidden.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-9\">Indeed, the Federal Communications Commission has provided expressly for radio communication essential to the discharge of non-federal governmental functions, including a public safety service of radio communication essential to official police activities. 47 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 89.1 <em>et seq. </em>(1976). Accordingly, the Commission has allocated a frequency for police radar. 47 C.F.R. \u00a7 89.101 (1976). The known purpose of police radar is to regulate the speed of motor vehicles on the highway. This purpose would be thwarted by the unregulated use of the \u201cradar detectors\u201d encompassed within the prohibition of \u00a7 46.1-198.1. Thus, in regulating \u201cradar detectors,\u201d \u00a7 46.1-198.1, rather than conflicting with the federal regulatory function, actually complements this function by protecting the effectiveness of essential police radio communication.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-10\">This brings us to the serious question presented by the appellants\u2019 contentions, <em>viz., </em>that the second paragraph of \u00a7 46.1-198.1 creates a presumption which is violative of due process guarantees. The paragraph in question reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b183-12\">\u201cThe presence of any such prohibited device or mechanism in or upon a motor vehicle upon the highways of this State shall <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>constitute prima facie evidence of the violation of this section. The Commonwealth need not prove that the device in question was in an operative condition or being operated.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b184-6\">In determining the validity of a statute making proof of one fact <em>prima facie </em>or presumptive evidence of another fact, a two-fold test is applied: (1) whether there is a natural and rational evidentiary connection between the fact proved and the ultimate fact presumed; and (2) whether the presumption is rebuttable. Unless the evidentiary connection exists and the presumption is rebuttable, the statute cannot be upheld against a due process attack. <em>Dooley </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>198 Va. 32, 34, 92 S.E.2d 348, 349-50 (1956); <em>Burnette </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>194 Va. 785, 790-91, 75 S.E.2d 482, 485-86 (1953).</p>\n<p id=\"b184-7\">Here, if we were confronted with only the first sentence of the second paragraph of \u00a7 46.1-198.1, we would have no difficulty upholding the statutory presumption, as applied to an \u201cequipped with\u201d violation. Given the single purpose of \u201cradar detectors,\u201d we believe there is a natural and rational connection between the proved fact that such a device is present in or upon a motor vehicle and the presumed fact that the vehicle is equipped with the device. And the presumption could be rebutted by evidence that the device was unavailable or inaccessible for use, <em>e.g., </em>that the device was operationally disabled or that it was locked in the trunk of the vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-8\">But the paragraph in question contains a second sentence which states, in part, that the Commonwealth \u201cneed not prove that the device in question was in an operative condition.\u201d It might be argued that the only effect of this sentence is to make clear that the Commonwealth can established a <em>prima facie </em>\u201cequipped with\u201d violation without proof of \u201coperative condition.\u201d But this proposition is already made clear by the first sentence. Instead, we believe that the effect of the second sentence, when read with the paragraph as a whole, is to exclude from consideration any evidence concerning \u201coperative condition\u201d and, thus, for all practical purposes, to render irrebuttable the presumption created by the first sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-9\">Although the Attorney General argues that \u201coperative condition\u201d is not an element of an \u201cequipped with\u201d violation, he agrees that a motor vehicle is \u201cequipped with\u201d a \u201cradar detector\u201d when \u201csuch device is present in or upon the motor vehicle and <em>accessible </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>or <em>available </em>for use\u201d (emphasis added). Accessibility and availability are close kindreds of \u201coperative condition.\u201d And, as indicated earlier when we focused solely upon the first sentence in question, the validity of the disputed presumption depends upon whether it is rebuttable by relevant matters, including inaccessibility and unavailability. Yet, the second sentence renders the presumption virtually irrebuttable by making inaccessibility and unavailability irrelevant to an \u201cequipped with\u201d violation; it would not aid an accused to attempt to rebut the presumption with irrelevant matters.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-4\">Read as a whole, therefore, the second paragraph of \u00a7 46.1-198.1 permits an \u201cequipped with\u201d conviction upon proof of the mere presence of a \u201cradar detector\u201d in or upon a motor vehicle, despite credible evidence that the device was inaccessible or unavailable for use.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Thus, the statute permits the presumption in question to be applied as a purely arbitrary mandate, violative of due process. Accordingly, we cannot allow the presumption to stand.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-5\">With the invalid presumption excised, the substantive offenses created by \u00a7 46.1-198.1 remain intact. <em>Sharp </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>213 Va. 269, 272, 192 S.E.2d 217, 219 (1972). But, because the convictions in the present cases may have been based in whole or in part upon the invalid presumption, we must reverse the several judgments appealed from and dismiss the misdemeanor charges brought against the appellants.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-6\">\n<em>Reversed and dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b182-8\">\u201cIt shall be unlawful for any person to operate a motor vehicle upon the highways of this State when such vehicle is equipped with any device or mechanism to detect the emission of radio microwaves in the electromagnetic spectrum, which microwaves are employed by police to measure the speed of motor vehicles upon the highways of this State for law-enforcement purposes; it shall be unlawful to use any such device or mechanism upon any such motor vehicle upon the highways; it shall be unlawful to sell any such device or mechanism in this State. Provided, however, that the provisions of this section shall not apply to any receiver of radio waves of any frequency lawfully licensed by any State or federal agency. Any person violating any provision of this section shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and shall, upon conviction thereof, be punished by a fine of not less than twenty-five dollars nor more than one hundred dollars or by confinement in jail for not more than ten days or by both such fine and imprisonment, and any such prohibited device or mechanism shall be forfeited to the Commonwealth by order of the court trying the case, which shall make such disposition of the device or mechanism as it deems proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-9\">\u201cThe presence of any such prohibited device or mechanism in or upon a motor vehicle upon the highways of this State shall constitute prima facie evidence of the violation of this section.

The Commonwealth need not prove that the device in question was in an operative condition or being operated.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-9\">\u201cB. No person shall be guilty of a violation of this section when the device or mechanism in question, at the time of the alleged offense, had no power source and was not readily accessible for use by the driver or any passenger in the vehicle.\u201d Acts 1978, chs. 87, 91.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-10\">We express no opinion upon the effect of these amendments.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
