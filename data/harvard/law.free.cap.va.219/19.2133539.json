Bias, filed this suit against the defendant, White House Motel Corporation, seeking reformation of a demand note and the entry of a decree directing the corporation\u2019s duly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>authorized officers to affix the corporation\u2019s raised seal to the note. Plaintiff alleged in his amended bill of complaint that when the note was executed by the corporation in December of 1970, it was \u201cthe mutual intent\u201d of the parties to affix the corporate seal to the instrument.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-5\">After an <em>ore tenus </em>hearing, the Chancellor, in a letter opinion, held that under the present Virginia law \u201cCode \u00a7\u00a7 13.1-2.1 (c) and 11-3,\u201d the affixing of the defendant\u2019s corporate seal to the note in question was not essential to the validity of the instrument. But, the Chancellor said, when the note was executed in 1970, \u201cthe law ... was to the effect that the corporate seal was essential to the validity of the instrument,\u201d citing <em>The Covington Virginian </em>v. <em>Woods, </em>182 Va. 538, 29 S.E.2d 406 (1944). The Chancellor further found from the evidence that the parties \u201cmutually intended\u201d the note to be a valid obligation of the corporation, and this intent could only be effected by affixing the corporate seal to the instrument. Thus, the Chancellor entered his decree directing the officers of the corporation to affix the corporate seal to the note.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-6\">Defendant contends the note was a valid obligation of the corporation without the corporate seal when it was executed in 1970, and the Chancellor erred (1) in decreeing as a matter of law that the seal of the corporation had to be affixed to the note for it to be a valid corporate obligation, and (2) in directing the authorized officers of the corporation to affix its corporate seal to the note.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-7\">The evidence shows that on July 1, 1969, the officers of the corporation executed and delivered to the plaintiff a non-interest bearing demand note in the amount of $9,000 as part payment for services rendered to the corporation. The seal of the corporation was not affixed to the note.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-8\">The corporation did not pay the note, and in December 1970, plaintiff prepared a new $9,000 demand, interest-bearing note to exchange for the old one. The new note was dated July 1,1969 and was duly signed by the authorized officers of the corporation. The first note was marked \u201cpaid and cancelled.\u201d Plaintiff testified that at the time the second note was executed, he assumed the corporate seal had been affixed. In fact, the note did not contain the corporate seal. Plaintiff further said that he placed the note in his safe where it remained until the latter part of 1975 when he made demand for payment and it was refused.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-9\">The rule that a corporation may make a contract without the use of a seal in all cases where this may be done by an individual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>has been firmly established in the case law of Virginia for more than a century and a half. <em>Kelly </em>v. <em>Board of Public Works, </em>75 Va. 263, 270-71 (1881); <em>The Banks </em>v. <em>Poitiaux,24 </em>Va. (3 Rand.) <em>136,143 </em>(1825); <em>Legrand </em>v. <em>Hampden Sidney College, </em>19 Va. (5 Munf.) 324 (1817).</p>\n<p id=\"b163-5\">The rationale of the rule is that business corporations routinely make a wide variety of contracts in the course of their affairs each day. If each contract had to have a raised seal of the corporation impressed upon it by the appropriate corporate officer before it became a valid obligation, business transactions would be cumbersome and time-consuming. Corporations would find it difficult, if not impossible, to act through agents in branch offices.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-6\">The adoption of this rule in Virginia can be traced to an opinion by Mr. Justice Story in <em>Bank of Columbia </em>v. <em>Patterson\u2019s Administrator, </em>11 U.S. (7 Cranch) 299 (1813). There the Court, in explaining the necessity for such a rule, said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b163-7\">\u201cThe technical doctrine, that a corporation could not contract, except under its seal, or, in other words, could not make a <em>promise, </em>if it ever had been fully settled, must have been productive of great mischiefs. Indeed, as soon as the doctrine was established that its regularly appointed agent could contract in their name without seal, it was impossible to support it; for otherwise the party who trusted such contract would be without remedy against the corporation. Accordingly, it would seem to be a sound rule of law, that wherever a corporation is acting within the scope of the legitimate purposes of its institution, all parol contracts made by its authorized agents, are <em>express </em>promises of the corporation; and all duties imposed on them by law, and all benefits conferred at their request, raise <em>implied </em>promises, for the enforcement of which an action may well lie.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 306. (Emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b163-8\">It is true that in 1970 there were at least two corporate acts which required the use of a seal. Corporations had to affix seals to deeds conveying real property (Code \u00a7 55-119, Repl. Vol. 1974),<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> and to appeal bonds, except those corporations not required by statute to give a bond. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 8-477, now \u00a7 8.01-676 (Repl. Vol. 1977), and \u00a7 16.1-107 (Repl. Vol. 1975). But those code sections have no application under the facts of the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>The Chancellor\u2019s reliance on <em>Covington, supra, </em>was misplaced. There we held invalid the corporation\u2019s appeal bond because its corporate seal was not affixed and dismissed the appeal. At the time the^ bond was executed in <em>Covington, </em>all appeal bonds had to be under seal whether they were executed by corporations or natural persons. An appeal bond, by definition, is a sealed instrument. See Forrest v. Hawkins, 169 Va. 470, 475, 194 S.E. 721, 722 (1938), cited in Covington. Thus, Covington does not stand for the proposition that at the time the note in the present case was made all instruments executed by a corporation had to be sealed to be valid.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-5\">We hold that when the note in question was executed in 1970 without the corporation\u2019s seal affixed thereon, it was a valid obligation of the corporation. Thus, it was error to hold as a matter of law that the note was invalid because the corporation\u2019s raised seal was not affixed, and in directing the authorized officers of the corporation to affix the corporate seal on the note because \u201cthe parties mutually intended that the note be a valid obligation of the defendant [corporation].\u201d Even if the parties mutually intended the note to be a valid obligation of the corporation, that does not show that they mutually intended to affix the corporate seal to the instrument.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-6\">For the errors of law and fact, the decree of the court below will be reversed and the case remanded. On remand, the Chancellor shall consider whether the evidence establishes that there was a mutual mistake in not affixing the corporate seal to the instrument because that issue was not reached under the Chancellor\u2019s holding.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-7\">Reversed and <em>remanded.</em></p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b163-9\">The present statute, Code \u00a7 55-119 (Cum. Supp. 1977), eliminates this requirement.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
