Colbert, Jr., was sentenced in accordance with the jury\u2019s verdict to serve five years in the penitentiary and to pay a fine of $500. The defendant seeks reversal on the ground that the evidence was insufficient to sustain his conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-10\">The record shows that on the night of July 17-18, 1976, a rock concert was held near Rustburg, in Campbell County. During the course of the evening, a fight erupted at the rear of a van parked on the concert grounds. Police officers were called, and they quelled the disturbance. After the fight had ended, one of the officers observed the defendant, apparently alone, driving the van away from the site of the concert.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-11\">A short time later, two of the police officers observed the same van parked on the grounds of a nearby elementary school. Because \u201ctrespassing on school property after dark\u201d is forbidden, the officers proceeded to \u201ccheck out the van.\u201d They found the defendant alone in the front of the van, seated in a bucket seat on the passenger side. He told the officers that the vehicle was \u201cout of gas\u201d and that he had \u201csent somebody to get some gas.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b144-12\">When one of the officers walked around the front of the van to check the gas gauge, he observed the defendant \u201cpick up a white styrofoam bucket... from between his legs and place it behind the seat.\u201d The other officer observed \u201ca bag of what seemed like marijuana over the sun visor.\u201d When asked about the ownership of the bag, the defendant refused to answer. Thereupon, he was arrested and advised of his \u201crights.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b144-13\">Other police officers arrived, and a search was conducted of the van. In the styrofoam bucket the defendant had placed behind the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"3\">*3</page-number>seat, the officers found five \u201cnickel bags\u201d of suspected marijuana. On the seat occupied by the defendant, the officers discovered a large plastic bag containing \u201csome residue\u201d of a substance suspected to be marijuana.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-5\">The defendant had on his person \u201cover $200 in $10\u2019s, $20\u2019s and $l\u2019s and $5\u2019s.\u201d The money \u201cwasn\u2019t folded up or anything together, but it was just stuffed down in [his pocket].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b145-6\">The van was registered in the name of the defendant\u2019s former wife. The defendant told the police officers, however, that he had paid $1,200 for the vehicle, and he became upset when informed it would be impounded.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-7\">Laboratory analysis proved that all the bags discovered in the van contained marijuana. In total, 54.2 grams, or 1.91 ounces, were seized.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-8\">At trial, the defendant did not testify. He did call as a witness, however, a \u201cjuvenile\u201d the officers had found asleep in the rear of the van at the time the defendant was arrested. The \u201cjuvenile,\u201d who was \u201cgetting a ride home\u201d with the defendant, testified that, when the van left the rock concert, the vehicle was operated by \u201csome girl.\u201d The witness stated further he had been told by the defendant that, when the van became disabled at the elementary school, the girl had \u201cgone to get some gas.\u201d Another defense witness testified that, during the fight at the rock concert, \u201ca guy\u201d had placed in the back of the van a container resembling the styrofoam bucket in which were found the five \u201cnickel bags\u201d seized by the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-9\">On appeal, the defendant argues that the evidence was insufficient to convict him of possessing the marijuana in question. It was not shown, the defendant says, that he knowingly exercised dominion and control over the drugs. Furthermore, the defendant asserts, the evidence presented several reasonable hypotheses of innocence: the marijuana may have been possessed by the \u201cjuvenile\u201d who was a passenger in the van, or by the girl who purportedly operated the vehicle, or by the \u201cguy\u201d who allegedly placed in the rear of the van a bucket resembling the one found to contain the \u201cnickel bags.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b145-10\">We disagree with the defendant. We believe the evidence was sufficient not only to show that the defendant knowingly possessed the marijuana but also to exclude any reasonable hypothesis that the drugs may have been possessed exclusively by someone else. The drugs were found in a van which was occupied by, and under the control of, the defendant. Direct testimony showed that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>bucket containing five \u201cnickel bags\u201d of marijuana was located between the defendant\u2019s legs and that, when he obviously became fearful of detection, he removed the bucket and placed it behind the seat. A plastic bag containing a residue of marijuana was found on the very seat occupied by the defendant. Another bag containing marijuana was found above the sun visor, within easy reach of the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-5\">But, even though he may have possessed the marijuana, the defendant contends, he should not have been convicted of the more serious offense involving an intent to distribute the drug. The small quantity possessed and its method of packaging, the defendant says, are consistent both with personal use and with \u201ca recent purchase\u201d with intent \u201cto store\u201d rather than to distribute.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-6\">Again, we must disagree with the defendant. In the first place, nothing in the record suggests that the defendant personally used marijuana. Second, the quantity involved is not necessarily indicative of a lack of intent to distribute; indeed, the jury might well have inferred that the quantity seized was what remained from a larger supply held for distribution. Third, the method of packaging does indicate an intent to distribute; from the evidence, the jury might reasonably have found that the marijuana in the \u201cnickel bags\u201d had been transferred from the large plastic bag to facilitate distribution. Finally, considering the foregoing matters along with the testimony concerning the money found \u201cstuffed down\u201d in the defendant\u2019s pocket, the jury reasonably could have concluded that the defendant had consummated numerous sales of marijuana at the rock concert.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-7\">For the reasons assigned, the judgment of the trial court will be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-8\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
