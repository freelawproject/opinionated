Lee Cogdill guilty of the misdemeanor of procuring for the purpose of prostitution, Code \u00a7 18.2-348, and assessing a fine of $500.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>Under a limited writ of error, we consider whether the trial court erred in admitting into evidence tape recordings of certain conversations and in denying defendant\u2019s plea of entrapment.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-5\">On November 16, 1976, Mary Burns, an unmarried 23-year old secretary, approached Cogdill, a 46-year old practicing attorney, for legal advice concerning custody of her illegitimate child. Burns testified that Cogdill advised her that the father \u201chad no legal right ... unless unfit motherhood could be proven\u201d. Cogdill offered her \u201csome of the same advice he gave to all his girls\u201d, that is, to \u201cfind someone with a lot of money to take care\u201d of her. Cogdill then began to ask questions about her sex life, \u201chow many guys [she] had ever gone to bed with, how old [she] was the first time\u201d, whether she was \u201cliberal with [her] sex\u201d, and whether she would \u201cgo to bed with a guy for money\u201d. He told her that some men gave their women \u201ccharge cards to buy what they want\u201d and that \u201csome girls made as much as $300 a night for three or four guys and [she] could do the same thing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b416-6\">Burns complained to the police, and the next day a detective asked her to call Cogdill and arrange another appointment. Burns made the call and, with her consent, the conversation was recorded, apparently by a tape deck attached to Burns\u2019 telephone. That afternoon, she returned to Cogdill\u2019s office where he prepared a letter addressed to the child\u2019s father. While Cogdill\u2019s secretary was typing the letter in an outer office, Cogdill \u201cproceeded on with general sex questions\u201d, such as \u201cwhether [she] had been to bed with a black guy\u201d, \u201chow many [men she] could handle in one night\u201d, whether she would \u201cdo it for... drugs, that type of thing\u201d. Asked if she had used \u201call [her] charms to get him to tell [her] these things\u201d, Burns said, \u201cI was told to get him to talk\u201d and to lead him into conversation about drugs. She said that she \u201casked him how people got started\u201d and \u201c[he] said he would show me around and where to find these people, and he would take care of me.\u201d At the end of this conversation, which was recorded with the aid of a transmitter concealed in Burns\u2019 purse, it was agreed that Burns would call Cogdill the next day \u201cand he would see what he could set up.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b416-7\">In the second telephone conversation, also recorded with Burns\u2019 consent, Cogdill \u201casked me how many [she] could handle\u201d and, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>having been told by the detective to \u201c[s]ee if you can set it up now for more than one person\u201d, she told him, \u201cas much as you could get.\u201d Cogdill \u201csaid that he thought it would be better if it was just him, to see how I would like it, and get started into it\u201d, suggested a fee of $25, and fixed the hour for her to come to his apartment that evening. Burns kept the appointment and the police recorded the conversation which occurred after she arrived. Burns testified that she asked \u201cif we couldn\u2019t get the money out of the way first\u201d and Cogdill gave her $25. At this point, the police entered the apartment, arrested Cogdill, and advised him of his <em>Miranda </em>rights. The officers testified that Cogdill told them that \u201cI might as well turn my license in\u201d; that \u201che knew he should have been suspicious of her when she started asking all those damn questions on the telephone\u201d; and that \u201cI might as well kill myself.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b417-5\">Testifying in his own behalf and maintaining that the questions he asked were designed to determine Burns\u2019 fitness as a mother, Cogdill said that he became suspicious of her motives when she asked about drugs because he had heard rumors that the police had been investigating him for more than two years \u201cfor some involvement in drugs\u201d; that he pursued the conversation \u201cto play along with her and find out what she really wanted\u201d; that he had no intention of procuring her for the purpose of prostitution; that he gave her the $25 to discover her purpose because \u201cif I hadn\u2019t paid her, she would have walked out\u201d; that when he gave her the money she asked: \u201cWhere\u2019s the drugs?\u201d; that when he replied, \u201cIs that what you\u2019re here for?\u201d, she said, \u201cYou mean you don't smoke pot?\u201d; that both he and she were fully clothed; and that there was no conversation or conduct concerning sex.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-6\">Over defendant\u2019s objection, tape recordings of the two telephone conversations and that of the conversation during the second meeting in defendant\u2019s office were admitted into evidence and played for the jury.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b417-7\">Chapter 6 of Title 19.2 of the Code of Virginia (hereinafter, the Act) regulates both the interception and the disclosure of the contents of intercepted oral and wire communications. Defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>concedes that, since Burns gave the police prior consent to record the several conversations, the interceptions were lawful. Code \u00a7 19.2-62(2) (b). He maintains, however, that disclosure to the jury was unlawful. He reasons that, except as expressly authorized, disclosure of the contents of information obtained by an interception is a Class 6 felony, Code \u00a7 19.2-62(1); that the Act expressly authorizes disclosure in court, but only during certain specified criminal proceedings, Code \u00a7 19.2-67(3); and that, because the crime for which he was tried was not one of the offenses specified, disclosure was unlawful.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-5\">Focusing first upon the office conversation, defendant says that it was an \u201coral communication\u201d protected from disclosure because it was one \u201cuttered by a person exhibiting an expectation that such communication is not subject to interception under circumstances justifying such expectations.\u201d Code \u00a7 19.2-61(2). Defendant contends that the circumstances under which the office conversation was conducted justified his expectation of noninterception. He says that the office door was closed; that he and Burns were the only two people present; that the conversation was terminated when his secretary entered his office and was not resumed until she left; and that \u201cthe relationship of the parties was presumed to be privileged and not subject to disclosure.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b418-6\">In passing, we note that the attorney-client privilege does not extend to communications made in contemplation of a crime, <em>Seventh District Committee </em>v. <em>Gunter </em>, 212 Va. 278, 183 S.E.2d 713 (1971). More on point, quoting from <em>United States </em>v. <em>White, </em>401 U.S. 745, 749, <em>reh. denied, </em>402 U.S. 990 (1971), we have only recently decided that a defendant planning a crime has no justifiable expectation of noninterception of his oral communications concerning that crime and must be taken to have assumed the risk of revelation to the police, either through oral disclosure or by way of electronic transmission and recordation. <em>Wilks </em>v. <em>Commonwealth </em>217 Va. 885, 234 S.E.2d 250 (1977). Here, the conversation itself was part and parcel of the criminal enterprise.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-7\">We conclude that the contents of the tape recording of the office conversation were not protected from disclosure by the Act and that disclosure did not violate defendant\u2019s right to privacy vouch<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>safed by the Fourth Amendment. <em>See United States </em>v. <em>Pui Kan Lam, </em>483 F.2d 1202, 1206 (2d Cir. 1973), <em>cert. denied, </em>415 U.S. 984 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b419-5\">Turning to the recorded telephone conversations, defendant next argues that, inasmuch as the definition of \u201cwire communication\u201d in Code \u00a7 19.2-61(1) contains no language such as that contained in the definition of \u201coral communication\u201d, the <em>Wilks </em>explication of the \u201cjustifiable expectation of noninterception\u201d rule is inapplicable and disclosure to the jury was unlawful.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-6\">The Commonwealth argues that the recordation of the telephone conversations did not constitute an interception within the meaning of the Act and that disclosure was not, therefore, proscribed by the Act.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b419-7\">(3) \u201cIntercept\u201d means the aural acquisition of the contents of any wire or oral communication through the use of any electronic, mechanical or other device. . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b419-8\">(4) \u201cElectronic, mechanical or other device\u201d means any device or apparatus which can be used to intercept a wire or oral communication other than:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b419-9\">(a) Any telephone or telegraph instrument, equipment or facility, or any component thereof, (i) furnished to the subscriber or user by a communications common carrier in the ordinary course of its business and being used by the subscriber or user in the ordinary course of its business; or (ii) being used by a communications common carrier in the ordinary course of its business, or by an investigative or law-enforcement officer in the ordinary course of his duties. .. .</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b419-10\">Code \u00a7 19.2-61(3), -61(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b419-11\">Interpreting these definitions, we perceive a basic distinction between an interception of the contents of a communication on the one hand and a recording of the contents on the other. The former is an. \u201caural acquisition\u201d, an acquisition by overhearing; the latter is a recordation of what has been thus acquired. The Act proscribes the former when accomplished by use of a defined \u201cdevice\u201d; the Act does not proscribe the latter, even when accomplished by use of a \u201cdevice\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>Other language in the Act further reflects the legislative purpose to distinguish between an interception and a recording.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b420-5\">The contents of any wire or oral communication <em>intercepted </em>by any means authorized by this chapter shall, if possible, be <em>recorded </em>on tape or wire or other comparable device. . . .</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b420-6\">Code \u00a7 19.2-68(7)(a) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b420-7\">This language is identical to that in the corresponding federal statute, 18 US.C. \u00a7 2518(8)(a); and Virginia\u2019s definition of \u201cintercept\u201d is the same as that used in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2510(4). Construing these federal statutes and rejecting the argument that a tape recorder connected to a telephone receiver was an interception \u201cdevice\u201d, the court in <em>United States </em>v. <em>Harpel, </em>493 F.2d 346, 350 (10th Cir. 1974) said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b420-8\">We agree with appellant that the recording of a conversation is immaterial when the overhearing is itself legal. It is the means whereby the contents of the conversation are acquired that is crucial. ... A recording device placed next to, or connected with, a telephone receiver cannot itself be the \u201cacquiring\u201d mechanism. It is the receiver which serves this function-the recorder is a mere accessory designed to preserve the contents of the communication. This interpretation comports squarely with the clear distinction drawn between \u201cintercepting\u201d and \u201crecording\u201d under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2518(8)(a), which deals with judicially authorized interceptions. . . . We therefore conclude that the tape recorder in question cannot constitute the intercepting mechanism when used, as it is argued here, connected to a telephone receiver.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b420-9\"><em>Accord, State </em>v. <em>Gora, </em>148 N.J. Super. 582, 372 A.2d 1335 (1977); <em>State </em>v. <em>McCartin, </em>135 N.J. Super. 81, 342 A.2d 591 (1975); <em>Williams </em>v. <em>State, </em>507 P.2d 1339 (Okla. Crim. App. 1973); <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Wunker, </em>356 F. Supp. 44 (S.D. Ohio 1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b420-10\">Under the express language of the statute, Burns\u2019 telephone, an instrument \u201cfurnished to the subscriber or user by a communications common carrier in the ordinary course of its business and being used by the subscriber or user in the ordinary course of its business\u201d, was excluded from the definition of an interception \u201cdevice\u201d. The use of that instrument for the \u201caural acquisition\u201d of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>a communication was exempt from the proscription of the Act. The recording of the information lawfully acquired by that instrument was not, therefore, an interception of a communication within the meaning of the Act, and we hold that the tape recordings of the telephone conversations were properly admitted in evidence and played for the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-5\">Defendant\u2019s motion to strike the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence on the grounds of entrapment was denied and his proffered instructions on entrapment were refused, and he assigns error to both rulings.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-6\">We have repeatedly held that, when the criminal design originates in the mind of the accused and, thereafter, the Commonwealth does no more than afford an opportunity for the commission of the crime, the defense of entrapment does not lie. Whether the criminal design originated with the accused or was first conceived by the police may, in some cases, be a question of fact for the jury. No such question exists in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-7\">Burns\u2019 account of defendant\u2019s questions, comments, and advice during the original meeting in his office fully support the conclusion that defendant alone initiated the criminal design with which he was charged. Indeed, at that time, the police had not entered the picture. Thus, there was no evidence whatever to support an instruction defining a basic element of the defense of entrapment.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-8\">Defendant contends that, even if the police did not initiate the criminal design, there was evidence to show that their conduct following the original meeting induced defendant to commit an offense he otherwise would not have committed and that such evidence entitled him to jury instructions on entrapment. We do not agree. Rather, we believe</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b421-9\">[wjhen the evidence is viewed in the light most favorable to the theory of entrapment, it is clear that all the police... did was to afford an opportunity for the commission of the offense, an opportunity the defendant willingly accepted. Therefore, the evidence was insufficient, as a matter of law, to create a jury issue on entrapment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b421-10\"><em>Neighbors </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>214 Va. 18, 19, 197 S.E. 2d 207, 208-09 (1973) (citations ommitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b421-11\">Finding no error in the court below, we will affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-12\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b417-8\"> We cannot confidently determine from the record whether the tape of the conversation in defendant\u2019s apartment was played for the jury, but for purposes of this opinion we will assume that it was..</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
