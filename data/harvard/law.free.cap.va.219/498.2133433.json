Va. 1976). Second, jurors serving in a criminal case may not, during the trial, properly read newspaper stories or listen to media reports discussing the proceedings. The basis for this elementary proposition is that a juror\u2019s information about the case should come only from the evidence presented at trial and not from any extraneous source. Third, upon a showing that such jurors have read or heard news accounts of the proceedings, the test to be used by the trial court in determining if a mistrial or a new trial should be ordered is whether under the circumstances there has been interference with a fair trial. Annot., 31 A.L.R. 2d 417, 420-21. Fourth, mere reading or hearing news accounts of the trial while it is in progress does not in every case amount to prejudicial misconduct by the jury as a matter of law. <em>State </em>v. <em>McLaughlin, </em>250 Iowa 435, 447, 94 N.W.2d 303, 310 (1959). Some publicity to which jurors have been exposed may be inherently prejudicial while in other cases inquiry will be necessary to ascertain whether the information \u201cmay have effectively prejudiced the jury in its deliberation.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>230 S.E.2d at 745. Fifth, the decision whether such media information brought to the jury\u2019s attention results in prejudice to the defendant rests in the sound discretion of the trial court. <em>Marshall </em>v. <em>United States, </em>360 U.S. 310, 312 (1959). See <em>Asbury </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>211 Va. 101, 106, 175 S.E.2d 239, 242 (1970). And, sixth, because there can be no fixed rule which defines what constitutes prejudicial interference with a fair trial, each case must be decided on its special facts. <em>Marshall </em>v. <em>United States, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b642-5\">We now turn to the facts of this case. Convicted by a jury of murder in the first degree and of using a firearm in the commission of a felony, defendant Melvin Thompson appeals the September 1977 final order sentencing him in accordance with the verdict to imprisonment for 20 years and one year respectively for the two crimes. While two issues were debated on brief, the parties <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>addressed only one during oral argument; thus, we will limit our decision to a consideration of that issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-5\">On May 17, 1977, in the early evening, Billy R. McGlothen was shot and killed while sitting in a small grandstand near a ball field in a recreation area in Portsmouth. The evidence showed that approximately 200 persons were in the general area of the slaying at the time with about 20 to 30 persons standing adjacent to the grandstand. The only eyewitnesses who testified at the trial were two teenage boys who stated that defendant, who was also in the bleachers, shot the victim with a pistol three times from a distance of three feet, after which defendant fled the scene on foot. Defendant denied the crimes and testified he was in another part of the recreation area playing horseshoes when the shooting occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-6\">At the close of the first day of trial, after both parties had presented their evidence, the trial court ordered a recess, did not require the jury to be sequestered, and directed the panel to return the following morning. The jurors were instructed not to \u201cbe exposed to any form of the news media, radio, TV or newspapers,\u201d the court stating that if they noticed any newspaper article to \u201cjust put it aside and refrain from reading it until after the case is over.\u201d The judge added: \u201cThat [instruction] is very important so I hope you all understand that.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b643-7\">The afternoon newspaper for that day circulated in Portsmouth contained the following article with a one-inch high headline:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b643-8\">\u201cMAN ON TRIAL FOR MURDER \u201cIN SHOOTING AT BALL GAME</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b643-9\">\u201cPORTSMOUTH\u2014Selection of a jury began today in the trial of Melvin Thompson, 25, charged with murder in a shooting at a softball game.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b643-10\">\u201cThe case has attracted attention because police have said that despite the fact that the slaying occurred within sight of 150 spectators and ball players, nearly all the witnesses refused to testify.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b644-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>\u201cThompson, of the 200 block of Project Drive, was in the third year of a five-year unsupervised probation for rape when he was charged with the fatal shooting last May 17 of Billy R. McGlothen, 21.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b644-5\">\u201cThe shooting occurred at the Cavalier Manor field in Portsmouth.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b644-6\">\u201cPolice said it took three days to convince one witness to come forth. Two more later agreed to testify but one of them has since backed out, police said.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b644-7\">\u201cDetectives said they received more than three dozen anonymous calls from witnesses outlining details of the shooting, but the callers refused to testify in court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b644-8\">\u201cPolice said McGlothen and Thompson were near the bleachers at the park waiting for a softball game to start when they got into an argument. The men were not acquainted, said police who were unable to find out the reason for the dispute.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b644-9\">\u201cMcGlothen, a native of Detroit stationed on the aircraft carrier Nimitz, was shot in the chest, lower leg and left arm.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b644-10\">\u201cThompson was arrested near his home about four hours after the 7:10 p.m. shooting.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b644-11\">\u201cHe was placed on five years unsupervised probation on Dec. 6, 1974 when he was convicted of a rape in Portsmouth. He has been held on $100,000 bond in the Portsmouth City Jail since his arrest in May.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b644-12\">The record shows that during the morning of the .second day of trial, and after the court\u2019s instructions had been read to the jury, defendant\u2019s attorney stated: \u201cYour Honor, before we start, I believe there\u2019s a matter you were going to inquire of the jury.\u201d The court responded: \u201cOh, yes. Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, at this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>time I wish to inquire as to whether or not any of you by any chance read either the newspaper article appearing in the Ledger-Star yesterday afternoon or the article appearing in the Virginian-Pilot this morning?\u201d The following colloquy then took place between the trial judge and two jurors:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b645-5\">\u201cJUROR GUYOT: I read the Ledger-Star but it was similar to what I previously read some time ago.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b645-6\">\u201cTHE COURT: And the Lady?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b645-7\">\u201cJUROR GUYOT: Has no bearing on my feelings.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b645-8\">\u201cTHE COURT: What is your name, sir?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b645-9\">\u201cJUROR GUYOT: Guyot.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b645-10\">\u201cTHE COURT: The fact you read last night\u2019s article, would that influence your judgment in any way?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b645-11\">\u201cJUROR GUYOT: No, sir, it would not.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b645-12\">\u201cTHE COURT: What is the lady\u2019s name?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b645-13\">\u201cJUROR RISE: Julia Rise.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b645-14\">\u201cTHE COURT: What article did you read?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b645-15\">\u201cJUROR RISE: Last night\u2019s Ledger.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b645-16\">\u201cTHE COURT: Do you feel that would influence your judgment in any way?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b645-17\">\u201cJUROR RISE: No, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b645-18\">\u201cTHE COURT: How did you all happen to read those articles? You remember I admonished you not to read anything, be exposed to any form of the news media whatsoever.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b645-19\">\u201cJUROR RISE: It just had a large heading on it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b645-20\">\u201cJUROR GUYOT: It was very brief.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b645-21\">\u201cTHE COURT: All right, sir.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b645-22\">According to the record, closing argument of counsel immediately followed this exchange, the defendant raising no objection either <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>to the fact that the jurors had read the article or to the manner in which the trial court\u2019s examination of the two persons had been conducted.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-5\">Later, while the jury was deliberating, counsel for the defendant moved for a mistrial stating \u201cthat two of the jurors have read that newspaper article and I think it contains highly inflammatory and unwarranted conclusions and relates to matters which were not in evidence in the court.\u201d Ruling that the article was not prejudicial and that the motion was untimely, the trial court refused to declare a mistrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-6\">The question to be decided is whether, under the circumstances of this case, the trial court abused its discretion in failing to order the mistrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-7\">The defendant argues that the jurors engaged in prejudicial misconduct. In addition, the defendant contends that the trial court, in conducting the examination of the jury, should have followed a procedure adopted by the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit in <em>United States </em>v. <em>Hankish, </em>502 F.2d 71 (1974), and which was embraced by the Supreme Court of West Virginia in <em>State </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>230 S.E.2d at 746. The Fourth Circuit, stating that the recommendation on this subject contained in \u00a7 3.5(f) of the American Bar Association\u2019s Standards Relating to Fair Trial and Free Press \u201cgoes too far\u201d, requires that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b646-8\">\u201cwhere prejudicial publicity is brought to the court\u2019s attention during a trial . . . the court <em>must ascertain </em>if any jurors who had been exposed to such publicity had read or heard the same. Such jurors who respond affirmatively must then be examined, individually and outside the presence of the other jurors, to determine the effect of the publicity. However, if no juror indicates, upon inquiry made to the jury collectively, that he has read or heard any of the publicity in question, the judge is not required to proceed further.\u201d (Citation omitted.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b647-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>502 F.2d at <em>77</em><footnotemark><em>*</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b647-5\">Because of the view we take on the main question of prejudice, it becomes unnecessary in this case to set forth a procedure to be followed in a situation where prejudicial publicity is involved. Accordingly, we express no opinion whether trial courts in this Commonwealth, in order to determine the effect of prejudicial publicity, should interrogate jurors individually and outside the presence of other jurors when the court ascertains the jurors have been exposed to such news media reports during a criminal trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-6\">We turn now to the substantive question of prejudice in this case. Defendant argues that \u201cmuch of the information\u201d in the news article was not disclosed during the trial. Specifically, he says the news report set forth the following matters about which the jury had not learned from the evidence: \u201cThompson... was in the third year of a five-year unsupervised probation for rape ...\u201d; \u201cDetectives said they received more than three dozen anonymous calls from witnesses outlining details of the shooting, but the callers refused to testify in court. . and \u201cPolice said McGlothen and Thompson were near the bleachers at the park waiting for a softball game to start when they got into an argument.\u201d Defendant concludes that this information served to influence the jury against him and denied him a fair trial. We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-7\">We believe the trial court correctly decided that the content of the news article was not prejudicial to the defendant. The information contained in the media report which the defendant finds objectionable had either been disclosed to the jury during the trial or was otherwise harmless new information.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>The defendant admitted on cross-examination, when being questioned about a prior felony conviction, that he had been found guilty of rape, so the jurors were already aware that defendant was a convicted rapist. They only obtained from the newspaper the additional fact relating to the punishment imposed on defendant for that felony. Manifestly, the fact of unsupervised probation for such a crime could not prejudice such a felon in the eyes of a jury. Moreover, the references in the report to a refusal of many bystanders to testify or even identify themselves to the police was also harmless information. The jury knew from the evidence that many people were in the area when the slaying occurred. In addition, one of the investigating police officers testified: \u201cNobody at that ball field would talk to us at that time.\u201d Only two eyewitnesses testified, and they were minors. It was thus obvious to the jury from these incidents of trial that a number of potential eyewitnesses refused to cooperate with the police and the prosecution. Accordingly, the jury learned no material new facts on that subject from the news article. Likewise, the disclosure that the defendant and the victim were together and that they were engaged in an argument was innocuous. Testimony of the eyewitnesses placed the two men together at the time of the shooting. And the fact that an argument may have been in progress did not bear on the culpability of the defendant to his prejudice since he asserted an alibi defense. In summary, we cannot say that the jurors\u2019 misconduct interfered with a fair trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-4\">Consequently, the judgment of conviction will be</p>\n<p id=\"b648-5\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b649-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>RULES OF COURT Order Amending</p>\n<p id=\"b649-4\">\n<em>VIRGINIA:</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b649-5\">\n<em>In the Supreme Court of Virginia held at the Supreme Court Building in the City of Richmond on Friday the 22nd day of September, 1978.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b649-6\">Heretofore came the Virginia State Bar, by William T.
