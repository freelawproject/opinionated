Section 286 provides in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Af5\">\u201cIn the case of claims against the United States Government for use of a patented invention, the period before bringing suit, up to six years, between the date of receipt of a written claim for compensation by the department or agency of the Government having authority to settle such claim, and the date of mailing by the Government of a notice to the claimant that his claim has been denied shall not be counted as part of the period referred to in the preceding paragraph.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b583-26\">The preceding paragraph prohibits recovery <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>for infringement committed more than 6 years prior to the filing of the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-4\">Neither in the Act nor in the legislative history, consisting of the Senate Report and the House Report, is there any indication that section 286 was intended to apply to a suit in which the judgment had already been rendered. The judgment in this case allowing defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment and dismissing plaintiff\u2019s petition was entered on April 8, 1952. The above-mentioned Act was passed on July 19, 1952.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-5\">The passage-of this act was urged on the Supreme Court in plaintiff\u2019s petition for rehearing on its petition for certiorari. The petition for rehearing was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-7\">Since the Act relied upon was passed after our judgment was entered, and since there is no indication that it was intended to apply in such a case, plaintiff\u2019s motion for relief from the judgment on this ground must be denied. The other ground relied on is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-8\">Plaintiff\u2019s motion is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-9\">JONES, Chief Judge, and HOWELL, MADDEN and LITTLETON, Judges, concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
