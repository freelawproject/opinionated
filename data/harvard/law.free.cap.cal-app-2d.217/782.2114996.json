Judgment in favor of defendant was entered on a jury verdict; her motion for a new trial was denied. Plaintiff appeals from the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-10\">It is undisputed that plaintiff, a resident of Oroville, was staying at the hotel and was an invitee on defendant\u2019s premises. She was 81 years old and, according to a doctor who attended her, \u201csomewhat obese,\u201d but she was active, had no difficulty in walking, had good eyesight, and wore walking shoes with medium heels. Around noon on December 22, 1959, plaintiff attended a luncheon in the hotel; upon leaving and as she descended the stairway from the Renaissance Room to the Galleria she fell on the bottom step and was injured.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-11\">The stairway consisted of six marble steps. It was covered with either a Wilton or Axminster carpet; the evidence is also in conflict relative to its condition. Plaintiff claims that photographs (taken more than eight months later) show the carpet to be old, loose and worn. She stated in her deposition that when she went up the stairs the carpet at the bottom <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"785\">*785</page-number>\u201clooked loose\u201d to her but she \u201ccouldn\u2019t be positive about that,\u201d nor did she know where it was loose. Her nephew and a friend examined the carpet several days after the accident; they testified that on the two bottom steps it was old, loose and pulled away from the riser. Plaintiff\u2019s witness Mr. Smith testified that it was worn and sleazy. On the other hand, substantial evidence established that at the time of the accident the carpet, while 11 years old, was neither worn nor loose, and was in good condition. Dr. Benbrook, called from his office in the hotel, went immediately to the plaintiff who was lying on the floor about 2% feet from the bottom step. He testified that \u201cShe simply stated that she caught her heel and tripped.\u201d After the ambulance came he immediately walked up and down the stairs approximately three times and carefully examined the area; he found nothing and felt no looseness on any part of the carpet. His nurse, while waiting for the ambulance, also examined the stairs. She testified: \u201cWell, they seemed to be all right to me, I couldn\u2019t see anything wrong or defective with the carpet at all.\u201d Mr. Beckett, assistant manager of the hotel, who arrived before the doctor, checked the stairs and carpet while plaintiff was still there. He testified that there were no worn parts on the carpet at all and that it was well tacked down; he tested the carpet thoroughly with his foot and there was no looseness about it on any of the steps. He made regular inspections of the carpets.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-4\">Descending the stairs there was a handrail on the right side; it has been the same for nine years and has never been changed. It was consistent with the general custom and practice and usage in Los Angeles. The rail extended down within % of an inch of the nosing of the bottom tread. While it had some give in it the amount of play was only % of an inch on either side when good pressure was applied on the rail; it was firmly embedded in place, and was firm.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-5\">None of the other women who had preceded plaintiff slipped or fell, and Dr. Benbrook testified that in the eight years he had been there he had never known of anyone\u2019s falling on those stairs. There was no eyewitness to plaintiff\u2019s fall. Plaintiff did not testify at the trial but her two depositions were read into the record. She said that when she descended the stairs she held on to the rail \u201ctight\u201d with her right hand and kept \u201cquite close to that (hand rail) because there were quite a few people going down those <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"786\">*786</page-number>steps\u201d; that she felt her way with her feet. It is clear from her depositions that she was unable to and did not state what caused her to fall; she simply did not know. Asked if she caught her heel on the carpet on the step she said, \u201cI couldn\u2019t tell what I did, it happened so fast\u201d; she said she could not remember catching her heel on anything as she stepped down. While once she stated she \u201cmust have slipped\u201d because she fell, later when asked if \u201cit felt like\u201d she \u201cslipped,\u201d she said, \u201cwell I can\u2019t say.\u201d In her first deposition she said she did not know if she put one foot on a step and brought the other foot down on the same step before continuing down; in her second, she said that that was the manner in which she descended. She further stated she held on to the rail until she came to the end and then \u201cwent off with a push, and there was one more step to go and that is when I fell\u201d; she started to fall when she reached the end of the rail and when she let go of it, \u201cthe force of it threw me.\u201d Finally she said, \u201cI can\u2019t tell you exactly what happened.\u201d Asked if she recalled feeling any slipping sensation, she answered, \u201cI don\u2019t recall that\u201d; and if her foot slipped out from under her, she said, \u201cI really don\u2019t know. It happened so quick. I don\u2019t remember.\u201d While her testimony relative to the cause of her fall is inconclusive, it is apparent from the testimony of her witnesses relative to the condition of the carpet that she claims the looseness of the carpet caused her to slip.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-3\">Appellant contends that \u201cjudgment in favor of the plaintiff is the only one which finds support in the evidence. \u2019 \u2019 (A.O.B., p. 28.) She has failed, however, to do more than recite the evidence favorable to her and argue the cause as though we were the judges of the weight of the evidence.  Inasmuch as a general verdict of the jury imports findings favorable to the respondent upon all material issues <em>(Mitchell </em>v. <em>Kluber, </em>196 Cal.App.2d 18 [16 Cal.Rptr. 292, 88 A.L.R.2d 1140]; <em>Elliott </em>v. <em>Rodeo Land &amp; Water Co., </em>141 Cal.App.2d 404 [297 P.2d 129]), her contention requires her to demonstrate that there is no substantial evidence to support the verdict <em>(Nichols </em>v. <em>Mitchell, </em>32 Cal.2d 598 [197 P.2d 550]; <em>Owens </em>v. <em>White Memorial Hospital, </em>138 Cal.App. 2d 634 [292 P.2d 288]); she has the burden of showing not only evidence favorable to herself but all material evidence on the point. <em>(Murphy </em>v. <em>Hartford Acc. &amp; Indemn. Co., </em>177 Cal.App.2d 539 [2 Cal.Rptr. 325]; <em>Zint </em>v. <em>Topp Industries Inc., </em>184 Cal.App.2d 240 [7 Cal.Rptr. 302].)  Failure <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"787\">*787</page-number>to sustain this burden results in a waiver of the error assigned. <em>(Tesseyman </em>v. <em>Fisher, </em>113 Cal.App.2d 404 [248 P.2d 471]; <em>Cooper </em>v. <em>Cooper, </em>168 Cal.App.2d 326 [335 P.2d 983].)  Notwithstanding appellant\u2019s disregard of the rules, we have examined all of the evidence; viewing the same in a light most favorable to respondent and resolving all conflicts and indulging all reasonable inferences in favor of the jury verdict <em>(Primm </em>v. <em>Primm, </em>46 Cal.2d 690 [299 P.2d 231]; <em>Grainger </em>v. <em>Antoyan, </em>48 Cal.2d 805 [313 P.2d 848]; <em>Crawford </em>v. <em>Southern Pac. Co., </em>3 Cal.2d 427 [45 P.2d 183]), we find it more than ample to support the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-5\">The evidence raised several issues of fact for the determination of the jury\u2014the condition of the carpet and handrail and the cause of plaintiff\u2019s fall. Appellant\u2019s testimony was inconclusive. She apparently was unable to state what caused her to fall; she either could not recall or did not know. Considerable dispute arose concerning the kind of carpet used on the stairs and its condition. Thus, it cannot be said, that as a matter of law defendant\u2019s negligence was established. <em>(Sunseri </em>v. <em>Dime Taxi Corp., </em>57 Cal.App.2d 926 [135 P.2d 654]; <em>Von Roux </em>v. <em>Pershing Square Garage Corp., </em>189 Cal.App.2d 626 [11 Cal.Rptr. 656]; <em>Crawford </em>v. <em>Southern Pac. Co., </em>3 Cal.2d 427 [45 P.2d 183].) It was for the trier of fact to evaluate the testimony of the witnesses, determine their credibility, weigh the evidence and resolve the factual conflicts. By its verdict the jury found the carpet and rail to be in good condition and not the cause of plaintiff\u2019s fall.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-6\">Appellant cites error in certain rulings on the evidence.  The first relates to the testimony of Mrs. Mae Carvell, plaintiff\u2019s witness. Mrs. Carvell had attended the same luncheon; when she walked out she found plaintiff on the floor. She testified she waited with her but had no conversation with her regarding her fall for she was concerned about her injury: <em>\u201c... I </em>didn\u2019t look at the steps. I have gone down them. I know them pretty well.\u201d Plaintiff\u2019s counsel then asked her, \u201cDid you make any examination at that time of the steps,\u201d to which she replied: \u201cNo, I did not. I did not\u2014 they are dark when you come out of that room and you are liable not to hit all the steps with your feet.\u201d The answer was stricken on motion of defense counsel. Plaintiff\u2019s counsel continued: \u201cDo you have any recollection now of the condition of those stairs at the time you walked down them following the luncheon?\u201d Mrs. Carvell answered, \u201cNot <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"788\">*788</page-number>\u2014I haven\u2019t even looked at the steps as I go by there, but I do know that when you go down those steps-.\u201d Defense counsel interrupted her with a motion to strike as not responsive. The motion was granted. Then she was asked if she had any recollection of the condition of the stairs on the date of the accident; she replied: \u201cNot at that particular time. I have no recollection of the condition of the stairs at that time, the steps.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b806-5\">Appellant says it was error to strike the foregoing two answers; that she was deprived of Mrs. Carvell\u2019s testimony of \u201cwhat conditions actually were when one emerges from the Renaissance Room and attempts to use the steps in question.\u201d (A.O.B., p. 12.) Relative to the first answer, all but \u201cNo, I did not\u201d was properly stricken as unresponsive to the question (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 2056), even though no ground for the motion was specified. <em>(Davey </em>v. <em>Southern Pac. Co., </em>116 Cal. 325 [48 P. 117].) Nor was the second answer responsive. But we fail to see any ground for complaint for the record shows that the same question was again asked Mrs. Carvell and she answered that she had \u201cno recollection of the condition of the stairs at that time.\u201d She was at no time prevented from testifying as to her knowledge, if any she had, of the condition of the steps, or from describing them; but the fact is, according to her own testimony, that she did not know their condition at the time of the accident for she did not then examine them.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-6\">Complaint is made that the lower court erred in permitting \u201cdefendant\u2019s counsel to identify as Exhibit C and make use of, if not actually introduce in evidence, a purported diagram of the construction of a carpet supposed to be similar to that here involved\u201d (A.O.B., p. 14), because the \u201cdiagram\u201d did not purport to be a description of a Wilton loom.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-7\">Plaintiff claimed the stairway was laid with a Wilton carpet; there is evidence that it was an Axminster. Smith, plaintiff\u2019s witness, owner of a carpet business and experienced in carpet laying, testified that the type of carpeting used in the hotel was of \u201cexcellent quality\u201d; then he ivas questioned about its condition, shown exhibit 25, a photograph, and asked if he could tell from it the general type of carpeting employed on the stairs. He replied that it appeared to be a \u201cwoven through the back Wilton,\u201d and \u201can excellent quality carpet.\u201d On cross-examination defense counsel asked him to draw on a sheet of paper a longitudinal see<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"789\">*789</page-number>tion of a \u201cWilton carpet of excellent quality such as that shown in the photograph\u201d; he did so. Then after inquiring in detail about the manner in which a carpet is woven, defense counsel drew on the same sheet of paper a drawing, referred to by appellant as a \u201cdiagram,\u201d to illustrate \u201cthe chain,\u201d \u201cpile,\u201d \u201cwarp,\u201d \u201cwoof,\u201d and \u201cstuffier warp.\u201d The paper containing both drawings was marked for identification (Bx. C for identification only), but was at no time introduced or admitted into evidence or given to the jury as an exhibit. Thereafter on redirect examination plaintiff\u2019s counsel established by Smith wherein the illustration was incorrect and moved to strike \u201cthis exhibit.\u201d The court called his attention to the fact \u201cit is not in evidence, it is merely for identification.\u201d Counsel did not then, or any time later, ask the court to instruct the jury to disregard it; in fact, he himself later referred to it in connection with his cross-examination of Patterson. Patterson looked at it and said \u201che didn\u2019t know what it was\u201d; the court a second time stated: \u201cThis is not in evidence in any event.\u201d Moreover the testimony of both Smith and Patterson left no doubt that the illustration was incorrect and entitled to no weight or consideration; we assume that this was also readily apparent to the jurors who had \u2018 \u2018 ordinary intelligence and good sense.\u201d <em>(Ballou </em>v. <em>Andrews Banking Co., </em>128 Cal. 562, 567 [619 P. 102].) We find no error or prejudice; neither did the trial judge who passed on the point when he denied plaintiff\u2019s motion for a new trial. <em>(Ades </em>v. <em>Brush, </em>66 Cal.App.2d 436 [152 P.2d 519].)</p>\n<p id=\"b807-4\">Error is assigned to the admission in evidence of Exhibit F, cutting of carpet, inasmuch as there is no evidence to show from where it came. Plaintiff\u2019s witness Smith brought to court a piece of Wilton carpet (Ex. D) which came off a yacht but which he claimed was comparable in quality and construction to the carpet used on the stairs; he had testified that a Wilton carpet of this type and quality could become \u201csleazy\u201d with wear. Later Eddie Heiberg, the Biltmore Hotel carpet layer, testified that the Renaissance Room and stairway were covered with carpet used nowhere else in the hotel; that four months before trial (about two and a half years after the accident) the Renaissance Room was redecorated and a new carpet was laid there and on the stairs; that the old carpeting was removed and sold and that only a few pieces were retained if needed in some room. Cut from one of the pieces was exhibit F; it was received in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"790\">*790</page-number>evidence not to show the condition of the carpet on the stairs, but to show the kind of carpet that had been used. There was evidence it was an Axminster carpet. But neither before nor after its admission did plaintiff interpose an objection. Thereafter, having shown on <em>voir dire </em>that Heiberg neither had personally removed the carpet nor was present at the time, plaintiff\u2019s counsel moved to strike his testimony on the ground that it was hearsay; the motion was properly denied, it having been previously established that Heiberg personally knew that the Renaissance Room and steps were the only places in the hotel having this kind of carpet. In any event the objection of \u201chearsay\u201d did not properly raise the point of the limited admissibility of exhibit F <em>(Griffin </em>v. <em>Jacobsen, </em>17 Cal.App.2d 68 [61 P.2d 350]); had plaintiff desired the receipt of the evidence to be limited she should have made this known to the lower court. <em>(Hatfield </em>v. <em>Levy Bros., </em>18 Cal.2d 798 [117 P.2d 841].)</p>\n<p id=\"b808-3\">Appellant\u2019s second claim of error, that the lower court permitted defense counsel to improperly comment on the evidence during the trial, merits but brief discussion. Examined concerning whether the type of carpeting used on the stairs wears longer than other carpeting, and his experience with the length of life of such carpeting, Smith was asked by plaintiff\u2019s counsel, \u201cAnd was that carpeting laid in a place subject to great public usage?\u201d He answered, \u201cTes\u201d; whereupon defense counsel said: \u201cMay the record show the peculiar drawn out \u2018Tes\u2019 that the gentleman gave, Your Honor? It would seem to me to express some doubt.\u201d The court replied: \u201cThe jury observed it. Let\u2019s go ahead Mr. Caldieott.\u201d Plaintiff\u2019s counsel continued: \u201cDid you have any doubt in saying \u2018yes,\u2019 Mr. Smith?\u201d He answered, \u201cNo, sir.\u201d We find no error here. It is not clear from the record whether Smith\u2019s \u201cyes\u201d was \u201cpeculiar\u201d and \u201cdrawn out,\u201d but the court obviously relegated the interpretation of Smith\u2019s manner of answering to the jury, exactly where it belonged. Moreover it is apparent no prejudice resulted from the request and statement, for counsel\u2019s next question cleared up any adverse impression Smith may have given in his previous answer. Had plaintiff believed error had been committed, he should have voiced his objection or moved to strike counsel\u2019s remark and requested an admonition to the-jury. He did none of these things nor did he assign.it as ipiseonduet. He is hardly in a position to do so now, <em>(Cody </em>v. <em>Vons Grocery Co., </em>189 Cal.App.2d 329 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"791\">*791</page-number>[11 Cal.Rptr. 277]; <em>Cope </em>v. <em>Davison, </em>30 Cal.2d 193 [180 P.2d 873, 171 A.L.R. 667].)</p>\n<p id=\"b809-4\">Appellant\u2019s assertion that in his argument to the jury defense counsel improperly stated that plaintiff had two previous falls within a period of two years preceding the accident, is based solely upon three identical affidavits in support of her motion for new trial. The record does not include the arguments of counsel, but on its face the affidavit of plaintiff\u2019s counsel, who was aware of the purported statement at the time, reveals that he interposed no objection, made no effort to correct counsel and made no request to the court for an instruction to the jury to disregard it. Plaintiff cannot now be heard to complain. <em>(Hicks </em>v. <em>Ocean Shore R. Inc., </em>18 Cal.2d 773 [117 P.2d 850] ; <em>McDaniel </em>v. <em>Dowell, </em>210 Cal.App.2d 26 [26 Cal.Rptr. 140]; <em>Cope </em>v. <em>Davison, </em>30 Cal.2d 193 [180 P.2d 873, 171 A.L.R. 667]; <em>State Rubbish etc. Assn. </em>v. <em>Siliznoff, </em>38 Cal.2d 330 [240 P.2d 282]; <em>Seffert </em>v. <em>Los Angeles Transit Lines, </em>56 Cal.2d 498 [364 P.2d 337] ; <em>Aydlott </em>v. <em>Key System Transit Co., </em>104 Cal.App. 621 [286 P. 456]; <em>Kershaw </em>v. <em>Tilbury, </em>214 Cal. 679 [8 P.2d 109]; <em>Causey </em>v. <em>Cornelius, </em>164 Cal.App.2d 269 [330 P.2d 468]; <em>Gray </em>v. <em>Robinson, </em>33 Cal.App.2d 177 [91 P.2d 194].)</p>\n<p id=\"b809-5\">Further, had such a statement been made and had defense counsel misquoted the evidence plaintiff\u2019s counsel could and should have corrected it in his closing argument. Moreover the court specifically instructed the jury not to consider as evidence any statement of counsel made during the trial. Nor in the absence of objection and request for an admonition to the jury can the matter be properly presented on affidavit after the trial.  However, for the first time it was called to the attention of the lower court on the motion for new trial under section 657, subdivision 1, Code of Civil Procedure, as an \u201c [i]rregularity in the proceedings of the . . . adverse party.\u201d But as pointed out by respondent this is not a matter of \u201cirregularity in the proceedings\u201d to be presented by affidavit, but one that can be called to the attention of the court at the time the incident occurs and to which objections and a request to admonish the jury may be made and a ruling thereon obtained from the court. \u201cIrregularity in the proceedings\u201d (\u00a7 657, subd. 1) \u201cis intended to refer to matters which appellant cannot fully present by exceptions taken during the progress of the trial, and which must therefore appear by affidavits.\u201d <em>(Gay </em>v. <em>Torrance, </em>145 Cal. 144, 149 [78 P. 540]; <em>Woods </em>v. <em>Jensen, </em>130 Cal. 200 [62 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"792\">*792</page-number>P. 473]; <em>Gray </em>v. <em>Robinson, </em>33 Cal.App.2d 177 [91 P.2d 194]; <em>Silcox </em>v. <em>Lang, </em>78 Cal. 118 [20 P. 297].)</p>\n<p id=\"b810-3\">And without substance is appellant\u2019s claim that the court wrongfully refused a \u201crequested\u201d instruction substantially in the language of BAJI, 213-J (relative to duties owed by an invitor to the invitee). But the record before us shows neither the instruction as set up in appellant\u2019s brief and her request for the same, nor its rejection by the court. Before the alleged error and a refusal to give instructions will be reviewed on appeal the record must show a proper request for such instruction and the ruling of the trial court in refusing to give it. <em>(Alexander </em>v. <em>McDonald, </em>86 Cal.App.2d 670 [195 P.2d 24]; <em>Kabzenell </em>v. <em>Stevens, </em>168 Cal.App.2d 370 [336 P.2d 250].) However, a review of the instructions given discloses that the matter of the duties owed by an invitor to an invitee was adequately and thoroughly covered.  No party is \u201centitled to have the substance of instructions given by the court repeated in different language\u201d <em>(Hayes </em>v. <em>Harry, </em>183 Cal.App.2d 412, 417 [6 Cal.Rptr. 671]) ; and instructions which are cumulative need not be given. <em>(Zuckerman </em>v. <em>Underwriters at Lloyd\u2019s, London, </em>42 Cal.2d 460 [267 P.2d <em>777]; Hicks </em>v. <em>Ocean Shore R.R. Inc., </em>18 Cal.2d 773 [117 P.2d 850].)</p>\n<p id=\"b810-4\">For the foregoing reasons the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-5\">Wood, P.
