On the original trial, the court, on September 5, 1958: granted a decree of divorce to plaintiff wife; granted plaintiff 12 specified items of community property and \u201c$737.62 from community bank account\u201d; granted defendant husband 11 specified items of community property and \u201c$150.00 from the community bank account\u201d; and then continued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b148-7\">\u201c3. That the bills of Dr. Carson in the amount of $325.00, and Dr. Marcus in the amount of $28.00 are to be paid directly from the community bank accounts.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b148-8\">\u201c4. That plaintiff\u2019s attorney be paid $250.00 directly from the community bank account, and that defendant pay the balance to plaintiff\u2019s attorney, Robert J. Grossman, Esq. within one year from the date of entry of this judgment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b148-9\">\u201c5. That defendant pay the arrears in alimony to the plaintiff in the amount of $399.81 within one year from the date of entry of this judgment. \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b148-10\">On appeal, the decree was modified so as to transfer one item (\u201cThe dog\u201d) from the list of community items given defendant to the list of items given plaintiff; otherwise the decree was affirmed. <em>Ballas </em>v. <em>Ballas </em>(1960) 178 Cal.App.2d 570 [3 Cal.Rptr. 11], On the going down of the remittitur, the decree was so modified.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-11\">The money and property awarded to her not having been paid or delivered, plaintiff sought the issuance of a writ of execution. After a hearing, before a judge other than the original trial judge, the court on July 13, 1960, issued its \u201cOrder in Aid of Judgment,\u201d directing that certain specified steps be taken to withdraw funds from certain designated community bank accounts and to effectuate its previous orders.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b149-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>On July 29, 1960, the return date of the order, defendant appeared in court and, to quote from the minutes, \u2018 \u2018 states that he has not complied therewith, and contends that he does not have to.\u201d The court thereupon continued the matter until August 3, directing defendant then to show compliance or to show cause why he should not be punished for contempt. Plaintiff tendered the property to be delivered by her, but the court\u2019s order was that \u201cit will order delivery upon compliance by the defendant with the Order in Aid of Execution [sic] made by this court.\u201d On August 3, 1960, the court ordered the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>issuance of a writ of execution in favor of plaintiff in the amount of $2,140.62 plus interest, indicating that the issuance of the writ could be stayed by an appeal bond in double that amount. '</p>\n<p id=\"b150-5\">Defendant has appealed from the order of July 13th<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and from the order made on July 29th. Whether or not he has appealed from the order of August 3d does not appear; but we assume not, since defendant\u2019s opening brief states (without benefit of supporting transcript) that execution, based on the order of August 3, 1960, was issued on February 6, 1961; that a motion to quash execution was denied on April 6, 1961, and that his petition for a writ of prohibition was denied by this court on June 8,1961. (2d Civ. 25570.)</p>\n<p id=\"b150-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b150-7\">Defendant argues that the trial court was in error, and without jurisdiction to issue the order of July 13, 1960, because that order (a) for the first time, in terms, ordered <em>him </em>to make the payments out of the community bank accounts and (b) for the first time identified by depositee bank and amount the accounts referred to in the interlocutory decree. He relies on the well settled proposition that a court may not, after such a decree has become final, modify it as to matters involving division of community property. <em>(Dupont </em>v. <em>Dupont </em>(1935) 4 Cal.2d 227, 238 [48 P.2d 677].)  However, it is equally well settled that a court has power to construe and clarify its orders, in eases of uncertainty, in order to sustain rather than defeat them. <em>(Goldberg </em>v. <em>Paramount Oil Co. </em>(1956) 143 Cal.App.2d 215, 223 [300 P.2d 329].)</p>\n<p id=\"b150-10\">Defendant\u2019s contention is without merit. The July 13th order clarified the interlocutory decree reference to \u201ccommunity bank accounts\u201d by specifying the particular bank accounts. Defendant was not ordered to pay any additional sums, nor to any different payees. Since it appears that the accounts stand in the name of defendant, the further order that <em>he </em>execute the payment directives adds nothing to the original direction for payment \u201cfrom\u201d these accounts.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b151-6\">Nor did the trial court commit any error in ordering plaintiff to perform only when defendant complied with the order of July 13, 1960. The fact is that plaintiff did tender performance, but, due to defendant\u2019s contemptuous attitude, the court ruled that performance by plaintiff was conditional upon performance by defendant. This appears to us to be perfectly consistent with the court\u2019s power to enforce its own judgments.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-7\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b151-8\">However, the portion of the order of July 13th charging interest from the date of judgment on the sums ordered to be paid to plaintiff as alimony out of defendant\u2019s own funds was a modification of the interlocutory decree. That decree had ordered these monies to be paid \u201cwithin one year from the date of entry\u201d of the decree. Insofar as the order of July 13th included interest for that one-year period, it was beyond the power of the court and must be corrected.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-9\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b151-10\">As above indicated, the briefs suggest that some monies have been collected under the writ of execution issued subsequent to the orders herein involved. Our affirmance of those orders with the modification indicated, is without prejudice to the power of the trial court, on proper application; (a) to grant defendant credit for any sums collected from him by execution or otherwise paid by him, and (b) to charge defendant with additional interest on sums unpaid after July 13, 1960.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-11\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b151-12\">Except for the minor correction as to interest, this appeal is totally without merit. The excess interest involves less than $18 and the error would, undoubtedly, have been corrected by the trial court had appellant called it to the court\u2019s attention at the hearing on July 29, 1960. By his recalcitrance, defendant has succeeded in withholding from plaintiff her share of the small community estate for almost five years. The appeal patently is frivolous and taken solely for the purpose of delay within the meaning and intent of rule 26(a) of the California Rules of Court.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b151-13\">The order of July 13, 1960, is modified by striking from paragraph \u201cD\u201d thereof the following words and figures: \u201cand $54.66 interst at 7% from date of judgment to this date on such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>alimony\u201d and substituting therefor the following words and figures: \u201cand $37.18 interest at 7% from September 5, 1959 to this date on such alimony\u201d; as so modified the orders are affirmed. Respondent shall recover her costs in this court computed as provided by rule 26(c) of California Rules of Court, <footnotemark>\u2020</footnotemark> together with $250 attorney fees, which sums shall be in addition to, and not in substitution for, any sums heretofore ordered paid by the trial court for such purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-4\">Burke, P.
