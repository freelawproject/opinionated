Appellants demurred to the complaint and moved for its dismissal on the ground of lack of jurisdiction. These demurrers' were overruled, the motions were denied and appellants were ordered to file their answers to the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-12\">By the instant proceeding in the superior court, appellants sought to restrain the municipal court from taking further proceedings. It was stipulated that there were no material issues of fact and that no proof was necessary because the facts alleged in appellants\u2019 petitions were un<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"641\">*641</page-number>disputed. Therefore, the issues presented to the court below and to this court are issues of law only. '</p>\n<p id=\"b659-5\">By way of their assignment of error, appellants make the following contentions: (1) that the municipal court does not have jurisdiction over criminal prosecutions relating to violations of the Cartwright Act (Bus. &amp; Prof. Code, \u00a7 16700 et seq.); (2) that the complaint filed in the municipal court does not state a criminal offense; and, (3) that at the time alleged in the complaint, the Cartwright Act was unconstitutional. We find no merit in any of these contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-6\">Appellants\u2019 arguments in support of their claim of unconstitutionality are essentially as follows: (1) a Colorado statute containing provisions substantially the same as those found in section 16723* <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> has been held to be too vague to permit of constitutional enforcement <em>(Cline </em>v. <em>Frink Dairy Co., </em>274 U.S. 445 [47 S.Ct. 681, 71 L.Ed. 1146]); (2) the provisions of section 16723 are necessarily included within the definition of \u201cillegal trusts\u201d as set forth in section 16720<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> *4by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"642\">*642</page-number>reason of the exception provided for in section 16726<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>; and (3) it follows, therefore, that the entire act is unconstitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"AY5\">Twice this identical argument has been made to our Supreme Court and twice it has been squarely rejected. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Building Maintenance etc. Assn., </em>41 Cal.2d 719, 723-726 [264 P.2d 31] ; and <em>Speegle </em>v. <em>Board of Fire Underwriters, </em>29 Cal.2d 34, 46-48 [172 P.2d 867].) In each' instance it was held that because the exemption created by section 16723 was added to the statute by amendment, it was <em>separable </em>from the rest of the act and therefore its unconstitutional vagueness invalidated only the exemption provision and not the act itself. It' is to be emphasized at the outset that the action filed by the Attorney General which is here involved was filed after the effective date \u00f3f the 1961 amendments of the Cartwright Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-4\">No useful purpose would be served by repeating here the excellent and comprehensive analyses of the arguments set forth in the cited decisions.  While it is true that the appeals in those cases involved <em>civil </em>actions, logic dictates that the rule that \u201can invalid amendment to a valid statute is ineffective <em>for any purpose </em>[citations] \u201d (italics added) <em>(People </em>v. <em>Building Maintenance etc. Assn., supra, </em>p. 726), must apply with equal force to criminal actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-5\">Appellants\u2019 contention regarding the lack of the jurisdiction of the municipal court over criminal prosecutions for violations of the act is based upon their interpretation of language found in section 16754* **<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>. as amended in 1961. Prior to the 1961 amendments to the act, section 16750<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> provided for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"643\">*643</page-number>the recovery of treble damages by any person injured in his business or property as the result of any violation of the act, and section 16754<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> provided for. prosecutions by the Attorney General, to recover a forfeiture of $50 per day from any person who violated the act.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-5\">Section 16750 was amended in 1961 to declare specifically that .\u201c [t]he State and any of its political subdivisions and public agencies shall be deemed a person within the meaning of this section\u201d and to authorize the Attorney General to maintain actions thereunder to recover the specified damages on behalf' of these governmental bodies. Section 16754 was amended to eliminate the prior forfeiture provisions thereof and to provide that the Attorney General, or a district attorney on .the order of the Attorney General, \u201cshall initiate civil actions or criminal proceedings for violation of this chapter.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b661-6\">It appears to be appellants\u2019 contention that because the Legislature saw fit to retain the expression found in former section 16754 regarding initiating actions thereunder \u201cin the superior court\u201d in the new section 16754, that it meant to render nugatory the express provisions of amended section 16750 that civil actions may be brought <em>\u201cin any court having jurisdiction </em>in the county where,\u201d etc. (italics added) and to create by implication an exception to section 1462 of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"644\">*644</page-number>Penal Code providing that in comities having municipal courts such courts shall have jurisdiction over misdemeanor prosecutions. This contention is wholly without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-3\">' Article VI, section 5, of the California Constitution provides that the superior courts shall have original jurisdiction in \u201ccases, of misdemeanor not otherwise, provided for.\u201d  Violations of the provisions of the Cartwright Act constitute misdemeanors (\u00a7 16755), and, in counties having inferior courts with appropriate misdemeanor jurisdiction, prosecutions therefor shall be had therein <em>(Union Ice Go. </em>v. <em>Bose, </em>11 Cal.App. 357, 359-364 [104 P. 1006]), but in counties <em>lacking </em>such inferior courts, prosecutions shall be had in the superior court <em>(People </em>v. <em>Sacramento Butchers\u2019 Protective Assn., </em>12 CaLApp. 471,487-490 [107 P. 712] ).'-</p>\n<p id=\"b662-4\">Therefore the mere statement in section 16754 that criminal proceedings <em>\u201cmay </em>be brought in the superior court,\u201d the court having original jurisdiction in all such misdemeanor prosecutions \u201cnot otherwise provided .for,\u201d falls far short of a showing of a legislative intent thereby to terminate the jurisdiction of inferior courts \u201cotherwise provided for\u201d in section 1462, Penal Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-5\">Appellants argue -in effect that we should regard the amendment of section 16754 as being the equivalent of the specific amendment of section 1462, Penal Code, in 1929 which created an exception to the jurisdiction over misdemeanors otherwise granted the municipal court therein, in cases in which the juvenile court is given jurisdiction. (Cf. <em>In re Gamo, </em>122 Cal.App. 725, 729 [10 P.2d 770].)</p>\n<p id=\"b662-6\">This we cannot do for two reasons. First, as our Supreme Court noted in connection with a somewhat, analogous situation, \u201cThe word \u2018may\u2019 is not usually construed as laying down an absolute requirement. The statute [Pen. Code, \u00a7182] does not, therefore,-state a legislative intention to give exclusive jurisdiction to the superior court of all prosecutions based upon an asserted conspiracy and, for that reason, does not fall within the exception stated in section 1425 [Penal Code delating 'to' jurisdiction of Justice Courts].\u201d <em>(In re </em>Williamson, 43 Cal.2d 651, 655-656 [276 P.2d 593].)</p>\n<p id=\"b662-7\">Secondly, as noted by the trial court in its memorandum opinion, the same 1961 legislative session that enacted Assembly Bill 897 amending section 16754,. had before it Assembly Bill 895 which would have amended Penal Code section 1462 by adding thereto the words \u201cexcept those arising out of Chapter 2 and 4 of Division 7, Part 2 of the Business and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"645\">*645</page-number>Professions Code.\u201d But this bill was not enacted into law.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-5\">\u201cRecourse to legislative history is proper for the purpose of ascertaining the intent in enacting legislation where there is a question with respect to that intention. [Citations].\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Superior Court, </em>199 Cal.App.2d 303, 310 [18 Cal.Rptr. 557].)  That the Legislature was cognizant of the possible propriety of amending section 1462 is clear and its rejection of an express provision to that effect is a very persuasive indication of the legislative intent.  \u201cIt cannot be inferred that the Legislature intended to do indirectly what it refrained from doing directly.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>p. 308.)</p>\n<p id=\"b663-7\">We must now comment briefly on appellants\u2019 novel arguments in support of their final contention that \u201cthe complaint does not state a criminal offense.\u201d Appellants, of course, do not assert that the complaint fails to state facts sufficient to constitute a public offense or that it does not comply with section 16756<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> of the Business and Professions Code. Any such assertion obviously would be futile, for the complaint not only contains \u201cthe words of the enactment describing the offense\u201d (Pen. Code, \u00a7 952), but it also sets forth facts that concisely but comprehensively describe the acts of appellants which are alleged to have constituted the violations charged therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-8\">Rather, it is appellants\u2019 contention that although the individual defendants were arrested on warrants on which the bail was set at $500 and the corporate defendant was served with a \u201cSummons on a Criminal Complaint,\u201d and notwithstanding that the defendants, both individual and corporate, were given copies of the document captioned \u201cCriminal Complaint\u201d which charged the violations as above described, they nevertheless are unable to determine whether the action is civil or criminal in nature. This assertion is made even though the criminal complaint concludes as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b663-9\">\u201cAll of which is contrary to the law in such cases made and provided, and against the peace and dignity of the People of the State of California. Said plaintiff therefore prays that a warrant may be issued for the arrest of said individual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"646\">*646</page-number>defendants and that a summons may be issued for the appearance of each business entity and that each of them may be dealt with according to law. \u201d \u2022</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b664-3\">In an attempt to add some semblance of substance to these arguments, appellants argue that, although the complaint .charges them with violating section 16720, subdivisions (a), (b),, \"(c), \"(d), \"(e)(1), (e)(2), (e) (3), and section' 16726 of the Business and Professions Code, it does not refer to section 16755 which prescribes the punishment for such violations.  There is no requirement that. in charging \u2022 an offense reference must be made to the statute prescribing the punishment therefor.  A defendant is entitled to \u201cnotice of the offense of which he is accused\u201d and the charging statement need not contain <em>\u2018 \u2018 </em>any allegations of matter not essential to be proved. \u2019 \u2019 (Pen. Code, \u00a7 952.)</p>\n<p id=\"b664-4\">In connection with this assignment, appellants also assert that the complaint is not sufficient because it does not comply with Penal Code section 959, subdivision 3, which requires that an accusatory pleading be \u201cmade and subscribed by some natural person. . \u25a0. .\u201d They argue that the typed name, \u201cStanley Mosk\u201d preceding his designation as \u201cAttorney General,\u201d and the signatures of five of his deputies, which appear below the verification of the complaint, do not constitute the subscriptions of \u201cnatural persons\u201d since each name is followed by a designation of the signer\u2019s official capacity. Appellants, of course, cite no authority in support of this unusual proposition. A complete answer thereto would appear to be supplied by the almost self-evident observation that when the Legislature has provided <em>wlio </em>shall initiate certain criminal actions (Bus. &amp; Prof. Code, \u00a7 16754), and also <em>how </em>all criminal actions shall be initiated (Pen. Code, \u00a7 959), it did not intend that the language used in the general section be given an interpretation that would deny the party specified in the special act the power to fulfill the commandments thereof.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-6\">Fox, P. J., and Ashburn, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-7\">A petition for a rehearing was denied July 23, 1963, and appellants\u2019 petition for a hearing by the Supreme Court was denied August 20, 1963.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b659-7\">Section 16723, Business and Professions Code, was repealed by Statutes 1961, chapter 796, section 1, effective September 15, 1961, prior to the filing of the complaint herein but subsequent to the commission of the acts alleged therein.
