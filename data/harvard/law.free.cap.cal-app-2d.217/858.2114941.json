Damages were demanded from Southern Pacific under the provisions of the Federal Employers Liability Act, and from General Motors for negligent maintenance of its premises. The instant appeal is presented on a settled statement (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 7 (b) <footnotemark>*</footnotemark>). Therefrom it appears that plaintiff, following an adverse jury verdict, unsuccessfully sought a new trial on several stated grounds. One such ground was the asserted misconduct of a juror during <em>voir dire </em>examination which, it is said, deprived plaintiff of a fair trial. The above contention is renewed on appeal<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>\u2014in fact, it is the sole question for our determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-11\">The claim of misconduct on the part of the juror, one Dorman who was subsequently elected foreman, is predicated on Dorman\u2019s alleged close relationship with the law firm representing defendant General Motors. The details of this claim are set forth in the declaration of plaintiff\u2019s attorney, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"860\">*860</page-number>Mr. Nutter, which was filed in support of the motion (for a new trial). According to the declarant, on a date apparently three days after entry of judgment, he received a telephone call from an unknown informant who gave him an \u201canonymous tip.\u201d Before doing so, however, the informant asked the declarant if he was aware of Dorman\u2019s occupation; the declarant replied that his knowledge was limited to answers elicited from the jurors on <em>voir dire </em>examination, including that of Mr. Dorman; that he had seen no reason to challenge Mr. Dorman for cause or to excuse him by the exercise of a peremptory challenge.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b879-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"861\">*861</page-number>The informant then told the declarant that Mr. Dorman was employed by Transport Indemnity Company which, according to the informant, was one of the largest in the business and one of the chief clients of the law firm of Dryden, Harrington, Horgan &amp; Swartz. In, order to \u201cverify\u201d the above information, declarant telephoned a number listed for Dorman and talked with a woman from whom he elicited the information that Dorman was so employed; he made a search of Martindale-Hubbell\u2014as a result, two photostated pages of that directory are attached to the declaration and list Transport Indemnity as one of the \u201crepresentative\u201d clients of the law firm in question; finally, from the business section of the Los Angeles Public Library declarant \u201clearned that the assets of Transport Indemnity are in the millions of dollars. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b879-4\">The declaration concludes with the statement that declarant tallied with a \u201cformer employee\u201d of Transport Indemnity who told him that Dorman had been employed by that company for more than two years. In this connection, but on information and belief, declarant stated that Dorman was \u201cwell aware of the fact that one of the prime clients of the law firm of Dryden, Harrington, Horgan and Swartz was the company by which he was employed and that a direct <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"862\">*862</page-number>and close relationship existed between his employing company and the said law firm. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b880-5\">Declarations in opposition were filed by the defendants. Richard A. Poxx, associated with the Dryden law firm, stated in his declaration that he was the attorney representing General Motors at the trial and that his firm had been engaged through the insurance carrier (Royal-Globe) for that defendant. As far as he knew, there was no relationship between Royal-Globe and Transport Indemnity; it was additionally stated by Mr. Poxx that he did not personally know Mr. Dorman and first became aware of the identity of Dorman\u2019s employer when he received plaintiff\u2019s memorandum (points and authorities) in support of the motion for a new trial. The declaration concludes with the statement that only portions of Transport Indemnity\u2019s litigated matters are handled by the Dryden firm\u2014other portions being handled either by Transport\u2019s house counsel or various law firms in the Los Angeles area.</p>\n<p id=\"b880-6\">The second declaration in opposition was executed by Mr. Dorman. Therein he stated that he answered the questions on <em>voir dire </em>honestly, accurately and to the best of his knowledge; that he had no personal acquaintance with the Dryden law firm or Mr. Poxx; that as director of personnel (for Transport) he did not participate in the functions of the company\u2019s claims department; except for the knowledge that Harold Q. Longeneeker was an attorney for Transport, he knew nothing of the handling of his employer\u2019s legal matters. Finally, his use of the word \u201csmall\u201d in his description of the size of his company was a comparative term based on its \u201ccomparative size\u201d to other insurance companies.</p>\n<p id=\"b880-7\">In a proper case it has long been recognized that where a juror is biased or otherwise disqualified, and these facts are concealed by false answers on <em>voir </em>dire, affidavits may be used to set aside the verdict in which he participated. <em>(Kollerf </em>v. <em>Cundiff, </em>50 Cal.2d 768, 773 [329 P.2d 897].) The <em>Kollert </em>case points out that this is an additional, and decision-made, exception to the general rule forbidding the use of affidavits by jurors to impeach their verdict\u2014the other exception being created by statute (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 657, subd. 2) where the verdict was reached by lot. Since the exception here sought to be applied is deeisionmade, we are necessarily guided by certain rules formulated in those decisions over the years. For reasons hereinafter stated, it appears that plaintiff has not complied with such rules, and accordingly his motion for a new trial was properly denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"863\">*863</page-number>First, it is axiomatic that hearsay statements of jurors contained in affidavits of counsel are not admissible for the purpose of defeating their verdict <em>(Conway </em>v. <em>Gurney, </em>181 Cal.App.2d 239, 245 [5 Cal.Rptr. 248]); <em>a fortiori, </em>hearsay statements of counsel are likewise incompetent to achieve the same result. <em>(Markaway </em>v. <em>Keesling, </em>211 Cal.App.2d 607, 611 [27 Cal.Rptr. 583].) As noted above, the asserted bias of the juror in the present case is presented solely by means of declaration by plaintiff\u2019s counsel; too, it is founded in great measure upon information supplied from unidentified sources. \u201cIf a member of the jury may not impeach the verdict by his personal affidavit or oral testimony, certainly he may not circumvent the rule by informing an attorney of the appellants by means of a telephone of his alleged misconduct as a juror and thus render his statement competent by the hearsay affidavit of some other affiant.\u201d <em>(Woods </em>v. <em>Pacific Greyhound Lines, </em>91 Cal.App.2d 572, 577 [205 P.2d 738].) Accordingly even if the anonymous informant in the present case had been a member of the jury (and, of course, there has been no such showing), plaintiff\u2019s contention would still fall short of established requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-6\">Second, where misconduct of the type here in question is relied on as a ground for a new trial, the affidavits of the moving party must show affirmatively that both <em>he </em>and his counsel were ignorant of the facts constituting the misconduct charged until the rendition of the verdict. <em>(Sherwin </em>v. <em>Southern Pac. Co., </em>168 Cal. 722 [145 P. 92]; <em>Crespo </em>v. <em>Cook, </em>168 Cal.App.2d 360, 363 [336 P.2d 31].) Here no affidavit whatever was filed by plaintiff in the trial court. Too, as far as Mr. Nutter\u2019s declaration is concerned, there is no affirmative showing that he did not in fact have the requisite knowledge prior to the verdict\u2019s rendition. These deficiencies further support the order challenged.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-7\">Third, it must affirmatively appear that plaintiff was prejudiced by the misconduct complained of. <em>(La Gue </em>v. <em>Delgaard, </em>138 Cal.App.2d 346, 348 [291 P.2d 960].) In this connection there is no indication whether the jury was polled following its verdict; if so, it is significant that such poll has not been made a part of the settled statement. Assuming that Mr. Dorman was prejudiced, as claimed, it was still plaintiff\u2019s burden to show affirmatively that prejudice resulted therefrom. Illustrative is <em>Irvin </em>v. <em>Padelford, </em>127 Cal.App.2d 135 [273 P.2d 539]; \u201cIn the present case it appears that the jury was polled after the verdict in favor of plaintiff and the poll showed ten \u2018yes\u2019 and two \u2018no\u2019 votes. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"864\">*864</page-number>It is therefore evident that since only nine \u2018yes\u2019 votes were necessary to secure a verdict for plaintiff, even though Mrs. McManus had voted the other way the verdict would still have been for plaintiff. Hence no prejudice resulted from any irregularity arising out of her <em>voir dire </em>examination.\u201d (P. 140.)</p>\n<p id=\"b882-5\">Finally, and particularly pertinent to the matters discussed in the preceding paragraph, the trial court was in a far better position than this court to determine whether plaintiff was prejudiced, and his claim in that regard was rejected. To the trial judge in the first instance is committed the task of deciding whether this decisionmade exception should be applied. Declarations in opposition to plaintiff\u2019s claims were filed; by its ruling the trial court impliedly found not only that plaintiff suffered no prejudice but that no dishonest motives existed on the part of the juror concerned. The record contains more than substantial support for such a finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-6\">The attempted appeal from the order denying a new trial is dismissed; the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-7\">Fourt, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-8\">Wood, P. J., did not participate herein.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b877-12\"> Formerly Rules on Appeal, rule 7(b).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b877-13\"> Plaintiff has appealed not only from the judgment but from the order denying a new trial. The latter order is nonappealable, its propriety being reviewable upon an appeal from the judgment. <em>(Litvinuk </em>v. <em>Litvinuk, </em>27 Cal.2d 38, 42 [162 P.2d 8].)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b878-5\"> As enjoined so to do <em>(Dunford </em>v. <em>General Water Heater Corp., </em>150 Cal.App.2d 260, 265 [309 P.2d 958]), the proceedings on <em>voir dire </em>have been made part of the settled statement. After the court had conducted its own examination of the prospective jurors, which included an inquiry as to whether any of them had a relationship of attorney and client with the parties\u2019 counsel (previously identified) or \u201cany other close business or personal relationship with any of the attorneys referred to,\u2019\u2019 the following occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b878-6\">\u201cThe Clerk: Robert W.
