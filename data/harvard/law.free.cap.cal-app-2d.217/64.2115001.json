Appellant duly appealed that judgment to the superior court. (Code Civ. Proe., \u00a7 117j.) There being no appearance at the time set for hearing in the superior court, that court entered judgment for respondent. A motion by appellant to vacate that judg-' ment, on the ground of failure to give statutory notice of hearing, was denied. Appellant now appeals to this court from such denial.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-8\">A District Court of Appeal has jurisdiction to hear appeals only in cases in which the superior court had original jurisdiction. (Cal. Const., art. VI, \u00a7 4b.)  Except as our jurisdiction may be invoked by petition for an original writ, we may review judgments of the superior court on appeal from a small claims court only where the case has been duly transferred to us pursuant to rules 61 to 69 of California Rules of Court.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> (Cal. Const., art. VI, \u00a7 la.) No such transfer was sought or granted in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-9\">The appeal, being beyond our jurisdiction to determine, is dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-10\">Burke, P.
