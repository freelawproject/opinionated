If <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"844\">*844</page-number>the audit discloses that the book value of the shares purchased and sold hereby, as of July 31, 1959, exceeds Sixteen Thousand Dollars ($16,000.00), Buyer shall pay to Seller a sum equal to said excess. In the event the audit, adjusted for actual value of the fixed assets is less than Fourteen Thousand Dollars ($14,000.00), Seller shall pay to Buyer a sum equal to said deficiency.\u201d The agreement further recites that the seller accepts and acknowledges receipt of the sum of $15,000 subject to the conditions of said paragraph 1. The said \" Addendum to Agreement of Sale\u201d recites, among other provisions, that \u201cThe agreement of sale entered into this 13th day of August, 1959, ... is hereby amended as follows: 1. Paragraph No. 1 is corrected to read as follows: Seller represents that the attached balance sheet as of July 1, 1959, showing a Net Worth of $27,862.47, is substantially correct. Buyer is allowed a period of ten days (10 days) within which to examine the books and records of Lakeshore Hi-Fi, Inc., and should the Net Worth in their opinion be more or less than the amount shown on the attached balance sheet, buyer shall have the option of requesting a full refund of the $15,000.00 to be paid and hereby paid for the common stock being sold. In that event there is no obligation on either the part of the buyer to buy or on the part of the seller to sell the shares of stock referred to in this agreement.\u201d Attached to said addendum is a document designated \u201cFinancial Statement as of July 31, 1959.\u201d This statement includes a \u201cBalance Sheet\u201d and a \u201cStatement of Income\u201d for specified periods of operation.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Concurrent with the execution of said instruments the sum of $15,000 was paid to respondent and the corporate records and the executed resignations of the previous officers of Lakeshore were delivered to appellant\u2019s attorney. Mr. Paine, president of both appellant corporations, thereupon requested Hood &amp; Strong, the accountants, to make an audit of the books of Lakeshore within the 10-day period. He was informed by said accountants that a complete audit could not be completed in 10 days, but that they would get all the information they could within that time. No extension of the 10-day period was requested ,of respondent by appellant. On August 22, and within the said 10-day period, Paine received a report from Hood &amp; Strong dated August 21, 1959, showing the \u201cadjusted net worth\u201d of Lakeshore <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"845\">*845</page-number>to be $24,885.41, instead of $27,862.47 as shown on the July 31, 1959, statement aforesaid. No exercise of the option to return the stock was made or attempted at that time. In this regard Paine testified that after discussing the report with his attorney, Mr. Giometti, and Mr. Strohl, it was decided not to exercise the option to return the stock.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Mr. Giometti testified substantially to the same effect.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Along about the 10th to the 15th of September appellant started to receive statements from suppliers which indicated a balance due from Lakeshore for which there were no accounts payable on the books of Lakeshore. Paine testified that they were thus required to write to the suppliers for a breakdown of their account and for duplicate invoices, and that because some of the suppliers were in the East three or four weeks were consumed in this process. Paine testified further that the presentation of such statements for accounts not on the books continued throughout September and October; that there were so many of them that he discussed it with his attorney and it was thereupon determined to give a notice of rescission of the agreement. This notice was given by appellant to respondent on October 23, 1959. The instant action for rescission, or, in the alternative, for damages, was thereupon filed on November 18, 1959.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-4\">At or about the time this action was filed, Hood &amp; Strong were instructed to make another audit which culminated in a report which was completed on December 4, 1959. This report disclosed that the net worth of Lakeshore was $15,377.64 and that it had a substantial loss for the year instead of a profit.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> According to this last report the net worth in the July 31 balance sheet was overstated by $12,484.83, and was $9,-507.77 less than the $24,885.41 net worth figure given by Hood &amp; Strong on August 22d.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"846\">*846</page-number>The complaint in the present action is in four counts: The first two counts sound in fraud and charge that false representations were made by respondent to appellant as to the financial condition of Lakeshore. Bach of said counts asserts that these representations were relied upon by appellant and allege that upon discovery of the facts appellant rescinded. The first count differs from the second in that it alleges that the false representations were knowingly made. The third cause of action is predicated upon failure of consideration, and the fourth count is for money had and received. The answer of respondent denies generally the allegations of the complaint and by way of cross-complaint seeks a reformation of the agreement of sale on the basis of mistake in that when the addendum was drawn it did not reflect the agreement of the parties to the effect that the sale of the subject stock was made without any warranties, representations or promises on the part of respondent relative to the financial position of Lakeshore. The trial court adjudged that neither of the parties take anything by its respective action, it being the conclusion of the court below that no representations were made to appellant with reference to the financial condition of Lakeshore or the accuracy of the balance sheet, and that respondent has fully performed the terms and conditions of the agreement of sale and the addendum thereto.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b864-3\">\n<em>Questions Presented</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b864-4\">1. Did respondent make any representations to appellant as to the financial condition of Lakeshore ?</p>\n<p id=\"b864-5\">2. Was it proper for the trial court to admit the extrinsic evidence on the issue as to whether such representations were made? If so, is there substantial evidence in the record to support the trial court\u2019s finding that no such representations were made?</p>\n<p id=\"b864-6\">3. If such representations were made, was appellant entitled to rely upon them? If appellant was entitled to rely on such representations, did it in fact rely upon them? If such representations were made and appellant was entitled to rely upon them is there substantial evidence in the record to support the trial court\u2019s finding that appellant did not rely on such representations?</p>\n<p id=\"b865-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"847\">*847</page-number>\n<em>The Question of Ambiguity</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b865-4\">In order to properly meet the issue as to whether representations were made we must consider the question of the interpretation of the agreement of sale.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark>\n                   If the construction of the agreement is based upon its terms without the aid of extrinsic evidence, its construction is one of law and we are not bound by the trial court\u2019s interpretation. <em>(Estate of Platt, 21 </em>Cal.2d 343, 352 [131 P.2d 825] ; <em>Meyer </em>v. <em>State Board of Equalization, </em>42 Cal.2d 376, 381 [267 P.2d 257] ; <em>Ziganto </em>v. <em>Taylor, </em>198 Cal.App.2d 603, 606 [18 Cal.Rptr. 229]; <em>Estate of Black, </em>211 Cal.App.2d 75, 83 [27 Cal.Rptr. 418].)  The basis of this rule is that where no extrinsic evidence has been considered there is no issue of fact, and, accordingly, the appellate court has the duty to make the determination in accordance with applicable principles of law. <em>(Estate of Black, supra; Meyer </em>v. <em>State Board of Equalization, supra; Estate of Platt, supra.) </em> On the other hand, where it is a proper case for the admissibility of extrinsic evidence and such evidence has been received, the appellate court will accept or adhere to the interpretation adopted by the trial court where the parol evidence is such that conflicting inferences may be drawn therefrom. <em>(Estate of Rule, </em>25 Cal.2d 1, 11 [152 P.2d 1003, 155 A.L.R. 1319] ; <em>Munier </em>v. <em>Hawkins, </em>190 Cal.App.2d 655, 663 [12 Cal.Rptr. 274]; <em>Transmix Corp. </em>v. <em>Southern Pac. Co., </em>187 Cal.App.2d 257, 269 [9 Cal.Rptr. 714] ; <em>Estate of Black, supra, </em>p. 84; <em>Irey </em>v. <em>Len, </em>191 Cal.App.2d 13, 18-19 [12 Cal.Rptr. 403].)  In the application of the latter rule, therefore, the question of its meaning is one of fact. <em>(Walsh </em>v. <em>Walsh, </em>18 Cal.2d 439, 444 [116 P.2d 62] ; <em>Irey </em>v. <em>Len, supra; Scott </em>v. <em>Sun-Maid Raisin Growers Assn., </em>13 Cal.App.2d 353, 359 [57 P.2d 148].)</p>\n<p id=\"b865-6\">The question of ambiguity in the ease at bench is directed to paragraph 1 of the \u201cAddendum\u201d and the crux of the inquiry is directed to the meaning of the first two sentences of said paragraph. A considerable part of the evidence adduced by both parties was devoted to the discussions and circumstances surrounding the execution of both the original agreement of sale and the \u201cAddendum\u201d thereto. It is obvious from the trial court\u2019s findings of fact that such evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"848\">*848</page-number>was considered by it in its interpretation of the agreement of sale.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b866-3\">Appellant contends that the written contract is unambiguous, and contains the entire agreement of the parties and that the trial court should not have considered parol evidence surrounding the execution of the contract and what the parties intended it to mean. No objection was made by either party at any point in the trial to parol evidence. The only reference in the record to the parol evidence rule was by the trial court itself <em>after </em>both sides had rested their respective cases and during a colloquy between court and counsel with reference to the presentation of points and authorities.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Even then no objection was interposed to the parol evidence nor was any motion made to strike the same. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"849\">*849</page-number>The objection is being made for the first time on this appeal. It should be noted from the record that not only did both parties choose to litigate the circumstances surrounding the execution of the contract and of the meaning of the contract and the addendum thereto, but the introduction of such evidence was initiated by appellant itself during the presentation of its case in chief.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-4\">The question whether the violation of the parol evidence rule can be raised for the first time on appeal has been the subject of conflicting views in this state. One view stresses the substantive nature of the rule; the other is based upon the fundamental policy which requires the raising of all issues in the lower court as a prerequisite to appellate review, and the principle that incompetent evidence' admitted without objection may sustain a judgment. (See Witkin, Cal. Evidence, \u00a7 358, pp. 398, 399-400.) Under the former, parol evidence contradicting an integration erroneously admitted without objection should be disregarded on appeal as of no probative force in determining the sufficiency of the evidence to support the judgment. <em>(Dollar </em>v. <em>International Banking Corp., </em>13 Cal.App. 331, 343 [109 P. 499]; <em>Harding </em>v. <em>Robinson, </em>175 Cal. 534, 540 [166 P. 808] <em>; Rottman </em>v. <em>Hevener, </em>54 Cal.App. 474, 479 [202 P. 329]; <em>Middlecamp </em>v. <em>Zumwalt, </em>100 Cal.App. 715, 723 [280 P. 1003] ; <em>Hanrahan-Wilcox Corp. </em>v. <em>Jenison M. Co., </em>23 Cal.App.2d 642, 645 [73 P.2d 1241] ; <em>Lifton </em>v. <em>Harshman, </em>80 Cal.App.2d 422, 432 [182 P. 2d 222] ; <em>El Zarape etc. Factory, Inc. </em>v. <em>Plant Food Corp., 90 </em>Cal.App.2d 336, 344 [203 P.2d 13].) Under the latter view, the admission of parol evidence to vary or add to a written instrument cannot be objected to for the first time on appeal and such evidence may be considered in support of the judgment. <em>(Pao Ch\u2019en Lee </em>v. <em>Gregoriou, </em>50 Cal.2d 502, 505-506 [326 P.2d 135]; <em>Tsarnas </em>v. <em>Bailey, </em>179 Cal.App.2d 332, 338 [3 Cal.Rptr. 629] ; <em>Jacoby </em>v. <em>Wolff, </em>198 Cal. 667, 676-677 [247 P. 195] ; <em>Graham </em>v. <em>Smither, </em>53 Cal.App.2d 701, 706 [127 P.2d <em>1024]; Bonner </em>v. <em>Finney, </em>110 Cal.App. 518, 521-522 [294 P. 466] ; <em>Tennant </em>v. <em>Wilde, </em>98 Cal.App. 437, 441-442 [277 P. 137] ; <em>Inner Shoe Tire Co. </em>v. <em>Tondro, </em>83 Cal.App. 689, 693-694 [257 P. <em>211]; Caine </em>v. <em>Polkinghorn, </em>54 Cal.App. 387, 390 [201 P. 936] ; <em>McComish </em>v. <em>Kaufman, </em>43 Cal.App. 507, 510 [185 P. 476].) <em>Pao Ch\u2019en Lee </em>expressly disapproves <em>Lifton </em>v. <em>Harshman, supra, </em>80 Cal.App.2d 422, but does not mention any of the other authorities supporting the first view. However, <em>Lifton </em>relies on all of the cases <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"850\">*850</page-number>cited above in support of the first view decided previous to its decision with the exception of <em>Harding. El Zarape etc. Factory, </em>in turn, relies upon <em>Lifton. </em> In view of the recent holding of <em>Pao CTi\u2019en Lee </em>and its express disapproval of <em>Lifton, </em>there appears to be little question that the Supreme Court has put the conflict at rest and that it is now the settled law in California that the admission of parol evidence to vary or add to a written instrument cannot be objected to for the first time in the appellate court.  Accordingly, we must consider the parol evidence adduced in the present case in ascertaining whether inferences can be drawn from the written agreement and the surrounding circumstances to support the trial court\u2019s finding relative to the intention of the contracting parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-3\">\n<em>The Question of Express Warranty</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b868-4\">Although appellant\u2019s complaint appears to sound in fraud and is based upon alleged false and fradulent representations, appellant states in its briefs that its case is predicated upon the theory that respondent made an express warranty regarding the balance sheet in question, that the balance sheet is false, and that if the balance sheet is false respondent is liable. Appellant contends that this warranty is expressly contained in the agreement of sale and the addendum; that it is a \u201cwarranty representation\u201d on the part of respondent as to the financial condition of Lakeshore; and that such warranty exists as an independent covenant not in any way dependent upon the option to rescind. That express warranty is found, says appellant, in the first sentence of paragraph 1 of the addendum which reads as follows: \u201cSeller represents that the attached balance sheet as of July 1, 1959, showing a Net Worth of $27,862.47, is substantially correct. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b868-5\">Notwithstanding the said language of the \u201cAddendum,\u201d the trial court found: \u201cThat neither defendant nor any agent of defendant warranted, represented, guaranteed or made any promise whatsoever in regard to the value of said stock, the financial situation of said corporation, or the truth or accuracy of said balance sheet.\u201d In making this finding of fact and a conclusion of law therefrom in the same terminology, the trial court undoubtedly considered not only the written language of the addendum but also the extrinsic evidence adduced before the court without objection. This finding was, in our opinion, amply supported by such extrinsic <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"851\">*851</page-number>evidence which the trial court properly considered and which we must review for the purpose of ascertaining whether it is substantial.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-4\">The testimony of Edward Meneoff, respondent\u2019s accountant, Norman Krauss, its vice-president, and respondent\u2019s president, Morris Bernstein, is susceptible of inferences which establish the evidence that respondent did not intend to warrant the value of the stock or to make any representations as to its value or the financial condition of Lakeshore, and that this intention was understood by appellant and was orally assented to. During the conversations between the parties in the course of the negotiations, both prior to and immediately preceding the execution of the agreement of sale and the addendum thereto, several statements were made by both Krauss and Bernstein that they were only selling stock and that they were not making any warranties as to its value or the financial situation of Lakeshore. Thus we have testimony that Krauss stated: \u201cthat they were selling capital stock $15,000 on the stock; that \u201che didn\u2019t want the price to be in any way keyed to the net worth of the company\u201d; that \u201cwe would not warrant any of the figures on any of the statements, because we wouldn\u2019t go into the books, plus the fact that anything could develop after, and still that we might not have any knowledge of\u201d; that \u201cI told Mr. Paine again that as far as I was concerned, the price was $15,000, and that I didn\u2019t want to reimburse the.buyer for one-half of any liability\u201d; that \u201cWe will not warrant any part of this.\u201d We also have the following testimony on the part of Krauss, which we set out verbatim.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Bernstein testified that he told <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"852\">*852</page-number>Paine that \u201cunder no circumstances could we warrant ehe sale, or anything about the sale, or the stock itself\u201d; and that he stated to Mr. Giometti, Paine\u2019s attorney, that \u201cthere were no warranties to go with this deal, and there should be no warranties.\u201d Bernstein gave other testimony which we also set out verbatim.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b870-3\">\n<em>The Option to Rescind</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b870-4\">A contract may contain a valid provision giving one or either party an option to rescind. <em>(Cline </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>96 Cal.App. 697, 699 [274 P. 761] ; <em>Brawley </em>v. <em>Crosby etc. Foundation, Inc., </em>73 Cal.App.2d 103, 118 [166 P.2d 392] ; <em>Wooton </em>v. <em>Dorr, </em>88 Cal.App.2d 781, 784 [199 P.2d 345] ; <em>George J. Birkel Co. </em>v. <em>Howze, </em>12 Cal.App. 645, 648 [108 P. 145] ; <em>Gay </em>v. <em>Dare, </em>103 Cal. 454, 459 [37 P. 466] ; <em>Spaeth </em>v. <em>Ocean Park etc. Inv. Co., </em>16 Cal.App. 329 [116 P. 980]; <em>Hernan </em>v. <em>Our Lady\u2019s Home, </em>32 Cal.App. 318 [162 P. 901]; <em>Phalanx Air Freight </em>v. <em>National etc. Freight, </em>104 Cal.App.2d 771, 773 [232 P.2d 510]; <em>U. S. Propellers, Inc. </em>v. <em>Zenith Plastics Co., </em>187 Cal.App.2d 780 [10 Cal.Rptr. 137].) <em>Hernan, George J. Birkel Co., Gay, Spaeth </em>and <em>Wooten </em>recognize the validity of a provision in a contract giving one party the right to rescind where such party is dissatisfied. In <em>George J. Birkel Co., Gay </em>and <em>Spaeth, </em>we have transactions involving the sale of corporate stock. Both <em>George J. Birkel Co. </em>and <em>Gay </em>involved a transfer of stock for an agreed price accompanied by an agreement by the vendor to repurchase the stock on the demand of the vendee within a specified <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"853\">*853</page-number>period of time at an agreed price with interest at a specified rate added. In upholding the validity of such a contract, <em>Gay </em>recognized the following rule (also quoted by <em>George J. Birkel Co. </em>at p. 648): \u201c [I]n all that class of cases where a purchaser of chattels pays the price, but stipulates that after a trial of the property purchased, or at some future time, he may, if he so desires, return the property and receive back the price paid, it is usually held that it does not amount in law to a contract to repurchase, but is, upon the exercise of the option, a rescission of the contract, and the title at once vests in the original vendor. \u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> (P.459.) In <em>Spaeth, </em>the terms of a contract for the acquisition of shares of stock were determined to provide that the vendors and vendee agreed that if the vendee \u201c \u2018became dissatisfied or wanted his money back' \u201d the vendors promised to return to the vendee the sum paid by the latter for the stock. It was there held that the contract constituted a valid option to rescind the sale of the stock. (P. 330.)</p>\n<p id=\"b871-4\">When an option is given for a specified period it must be exercised within the period and if not accepted within the time prescribed, it expires by its own terms. <em>(Rosenaur </em>v. <em>Pacelli, </em>174 Cal.App.2d 673, 676-677 [345 P.2d 102] ; <em>Wooten </em>v. <em>Dorr, supra; Rice Lands etc. Co. </em>v. <em>Blevins, </em>61 Cal.App. 536, 541 [215 P. 402] ; 1 Witkin, Summary of Cal. Law, \u00a7 53, p. 60.)  Accordingly, where a contract sets a limited time within which one party must elect to rescind, he will not be permitted to rescind it after the time specified has elapsed. <em>(Morganthaler </em>v. <em>Krieg, </em>101 Cal.App. 436, 438-439 [281 P. 692] ; see <em>Champion G. Min. Co. </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"854\">*854</page-number><em>Champion Mines, </em>164 Cal. 205, 213-214 [128 P. 315].)  On the other hand, if the agreement is silent as to the time for exercising the option, the optionee must exercise it within a reasonable time. <em>(Lohn </em>v. <em>Fletcher Oil Co., Inc., </em>38 Cal.App.2d 26, 31 [100 P.2d 505]; <em>Bergin </em>v. <em>van der Steen, </em>107 Cal.App.2d 8, 13 [236 P.2d 613]; <em>Spaeth </em>v. <em>Ocean Park etc. Inv. Co., supra, </em>p. 331; 1 Witkin, Summary of Cal. Law, <em>supra.) </em> What is a reasonable time for the exercise of an option depends upon the facts and circumstances of the particular case. <em>(Lohn </em>v. <em>Fletcher Oil Co., Inc., supra, </em>p. 32; <em>Auslen </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>118 Cal.App.2d 319, 322 [257 P.2d 664]; see <em>Spaeth </em>v. <em>Ocean Park etc. Inv. Co., supra, </em>p. 331.)</p>\n<p id=\"b872-3\">In the ease at bench the trial court found \u201c [t]hat plaintiffs declined and failed to exercise the option to return said stock as provided in said agreement and said addendum thereto.\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> A reading of paragraph 1 of the \u201cAddendum\u201d discloses a patent ambiguity, i.e., one which appears on the face of the instrument itself. <em>(Payne </em>v. <em>Commercial Nat. Bank, </em>177 Cal. 68 [169 P. 1007, L.R.A. 1918C 328] ; <em>Estate of Black, supra, </em>211 Cal.App.2d 75, 84.)  It is difficult to comprehend from a reading of the sentence providing for the option to rescind whether it means that the option was required to be exercised within 10 days, or whether the buyer was allowed 10 days within which to examine the books and records and then had an option to rescind. In the latter ease the buyer would have a reasonable time within which to rescind because no period therefor is specified.  Although the general rule appears to be that when the ambiguity is patent parol evidence is inadmissible (see 18 Cal.Jur.2d \u00a7\u00a7 275, 276, pp. 763-767; and see <em>Estate of Black, supra, </em>p. 84), it is also <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"855\">*855</page-number>apparent that the later cases in this state hold that extrinsic evidence is admissible to explain patent ambiguities as well as ambiguities which are latent. <em>(Estate of </em>Torregano, 54 Cal.2d 234, 246 [5 Cal.Rptr. 137, 352 P.2d 505]; <em>Estate of Black, supra; Neff </em>v. <em>Ernst, </em>48 Cal.2d 628, 635 [311 P.2d 849]; <em>City of Redlands </em>v. <em>Nickerson, </em>188 Cal.App.2d 118, 125 [10 Cal.Rptr. 431].) As we have pointed out above, however, we are not here concerned with the admissibility of extrinsic evidence because such evidence was admitted without objection. It is apparent from the trial court\u2019s findings that such extrinsic evidence was considered by the court below. The findings by the trial court did not express the option to rescind as one for a fixed period, i.e., one that was required to be exercised within 10 days, but it is clear from the record that such is the meaning of the findings.  These findings will, of course, be construed in support of the judgment if that can reasonably be done. <em>(City of Napa </em>v. <em>Navoni, </em>56 Cal.App.2d 289, 294 [132 P.2d 566]; <em>Townsend </em>v. <em>Wingler, </em>114 Cal.App.2d 64, 68-69 [249 P.2d 613]; <em>Anderson </em>v. <em>Pastorini, </em>117 Cal.App.2d 428, 431 [255 P.2d 855] ; <em>Peterson </em>v. <em>Allstate Ins. Co., </em>164 Cal.App.2d 517, 520 [330 P.2d 843].)</p>\n<p id=\"b873-4\">We now turn to the record to ascertain whether the evidence is sufficient to sustain the trial court\u2019s findings that the option to rescind was limited to the 10-day period and that it was not exercised within said period. The record not only supports the finding that no attempt was made to exercise the option within the 10-day period, but this is conceded by appellant. In fact the record discloses that the first notice of rescission was given on October 23, 1959, i.e., 61 days after the expiration of the 10-day period mentioned in the addendum. It should be noted, moreover, that although the said notice of rescission has not been made a part of the record, appellant\u2019s complaint alleges that said notice of rescission was predicated upon the statutory rescission provided for in section 1689, subdivision (b), of the Civil Code based upon fraud and failure of consideration and not upon the exercise of an option to rescind specifically provided for in the agreement of sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-5\">Assuming, <em>arguendo, </em>that such a notice would have sufficed as a notice to rescind pursuant to the terms of the agreement of sale it was not timely made because not exercised within the 10-day period. There was substantial evidence in the record to indicate that it was the understand<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"856\">*856</page-number>ing and agreement of the parties that if such option was to be exercised at all it was necessary that it be put into action within 10 days from August 13, 1959. Paine testified that after the addendum was executed, and on the same day of its execution, his attorney, Giometti, told him \u201cthat we had 10 days in which we could call the deal off if we wanted to. \u2019 \u2019 He also testified: \u201cThe following morning I called Hood &amp; Strong, the auditors, and asked them if they could rush this audit, because we had an option for 10 days to set the deal aside.\u201d Moreover, Paine\u2019s understanding that the option was to be exercised within the 10 days is evidenced by the testimony we have hereinbefore alluded to that he discussed with his attorney whether they should exercise the option after receiving the first report from Hood &amp; Strong and it was decided that they would not do so. There is certain testimony adduced from Krauss that Giometti handed him a check for signature representing a bonus due an employee of Lakeshore, whereupon Krauss stated to Giometti \u201cWell, why would we give him this now I We don\u2019t know if Mr. Paine might decide within the 10 days that he is going to turn this back, and we don\u2019t want to give him this at this time.\u201d We have already alluded to Bernstein\u2019s testimony wherein Krauss stated to Giometti \u201cyou would have 10 days time in which to look the deal over and turn it down; ...\u201d Giometti did not testify as to any of the conversations having to do with the 10-day period, but merely stated that he participated in the drafting of the language referring to it in the \u201cAddendum.\u201d There was also a conflict in the testimony as to whether he or Krauss drafted the option clause. Mencoff\u2019s testimony, on the other hand, was to the effect that it was agreed that \u201cthey would have 10 days within which to examine the records, and if they weren\u2019t satisfied, that his net worth was to their satisfaction, they had the option of returning it and getting their money back.\u201d Meneoff testified further: \u201c. . .1 think the remainder of the paragraph was essentially Mr. Krauss\u2019 wording, because he was the one that was allowing 10 days within which to examine the books. \u201d  The evaluation and reconciling of any conflicts or inconsistencies was, of course, for the trial court and we are not called upon to reweigh the evidence as long as there is a conflict of substantial evidence upon the controlling issue or issues. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Newland, </em>15 Cal.2d 678, 681 [104 P.2d 778]; <em>Florez </em>v. <em>Groom Development Co., </em>53 Cal.2d 347, 354 [1 Cal.Rptr. 840, 348 P.2d 200].)</p>\n<p id=\"b875-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"857\">*857</page-number>\n<em>The Trial Court\u2019s Determination</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b875-4\">It is our conclusion, therefore, that the trial court\u2019s findings that no representations or warranties or promises were made by respondent in regard to the value of the stock, the financial situation, or the truth or accuracy of the said balance sheet, and that appellant did not exercise its right to rescind within the time specified in the agreement of sale, are sustained by substantial evidence. Accordingly, the judgment must of necessity be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-5\">The briefs of respective counsel have also touched upon the question of reliance. Appellant contends that there is substantial evidence in the record that they were entitled to rely and did rely on the express warranty or representation of respondent. The court below made a specific finding to the contrary,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> and also made some reference in its findings to the fact that appellant had knowledge of substantial amounts due it from Lakeshore, which did not appear on Lakeshore\u2019s books, during said 10-day period and immediately prior thereto. Such findings, however, are not necessary to the judgment. If no warranties, representations or promises were in fact made, it necessarily follows that there was nothing upon which a reliance could be predicated. The issue of reliance is therefore moot and it is not necessary for us to discuss it.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-7\">Bray, P.

In California it is embodied in rule 3(1) of section 1739 of the Civil Code, which provides: <em>\u20181 </em>Where goods are delivered to the buyer \u2018 on sale or return, \u2019 or on other terms indicating an intention to make a present sale, but to give the buyer an option to return the goods instead of paying the price, the property passes to the buyer on delivery, but he may revest the property in the seller by returning or tendering the goods within the time fixed in the contract, or, if no time has been fixed, within a reasonable time.\u201d Although the Uniform Sales Act has been held not to apply in California to the sale of corporate stock <em>(Franck </em>v. <em>J.

Accordingly, in dealing with sales of shares of corporate stock, reliance is placed upon the law of the sales of personal property as provided for in the Civil Code (other than as stated in the Sales Act) and as they existed before the Uniform Sales Act was adopted.
