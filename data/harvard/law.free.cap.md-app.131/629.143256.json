Igwilo. Mr. and Mrs. Igwilo were the plaintiffs in a medical malpractice case <em>(\u201cIgwilo I\u201d) </em>against Dr. Maria Y. Que in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City. Dr. Que was insured by the P*I*E Mutual Insurance Company (\u201cP*I*E\u201d), which was adjudged insolvent after <em>Igwilo I </em>was filed. Subsequent to P*I*E\u2019s insolvency, the Property and Casualty Insurance Guaranty Corporation (\u201cPCIGC\u201d), appellee, provided a defense to Dr. Que in <em>Igwilo I. Igwilo II </em>was filed, also in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"633\">*633</page-number>Circuit Court for Baltimore City, to obtain a judicial declaration as to how many \u201ccovered claims\u201d the Igwilos had asserted in <em>Igwilo I.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b615-5\">In <em>Igwilo II, </em>the Igwilos filed a motion for summary judgment in which they sought a declaration that they had three \u201ccovered claims.\u201d PCIGC sought a declaration that the Igwi-los had only one \u201ccovered claim.\u201d The court granted the Igwilos\u2019 motion for summary judgment, but found that they had two \u201ccovered claims.\u201d Appellants appeal from that determination and present the following questions, which we have rephrased in the interest of clarity, for our review:</p>\n<p id=\"b615-6\">1. Did the court err in determining that the Igwilos had two \u201ccovered claims\u201d?</p>\n<p id=\"b615-7\">2. May Mr. and Mrs. Igwilo recover damages for loss of services and pre-majority medical expenses for their infant daughter?</p>\n<p id=\"b615-8\">We answer \u201cno\u201d to the first question and \u201cyes\u201d to the second question, and affirm.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b615-9\">\n<em>Facts</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b615-10\">In their complaint, the Igwilos asserted that Dr. Que committed medical malpractice by not properly treating Mrs. Igwilo while she was pregnant. The complaint alleged that after a prenatal examination on August 10, 1996, Dr. Que <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"634\">*634</page-number>failed to diagnose Mrs. Igwilo with preeclampsia. As a result of Dr. Que\u2019s malpractice, on August 25, 1996, Ozioma A. Igwilo, the Igwilos\u2019 child, was born with severe and irreversible brain damage.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-4\">The Igwilos further asserted that Mrs. Igwilo suffered various physical symptoms and problems that would not have occurred but for Dr. Que\u2019s negligence. These symptoms included pain, severe swelling of the face and extremities, headache, epigastric pain, progression of the disease from mild preeclampsia to severe preeclampsia to severe toxemia, and performance of an emergency cesarean section because her condition was too far advanced to respond to drug therapy and other conservative measures.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-5\">As parents and next friends of Ozioma Igwilo, Mr. and Mrs. Igwilo sought damages as a result of the child\u2019s bodily injuries. In addition, the parents in their individual capacities sought recovery of damages that they suffered because of Ozioma\u2019s injuries. The parties dispute whether the complaint also sought compensation for damages arising out of the bodily injuries to Mrs. Igwilo.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-6\">Dr. Que was insured by P*I*E under a policy that provided liability coverage of $1,000,000.00 for \u201ceach claim\u201d and $3,000,-000.00 as an \u201cannual aggregate.\u201d P*I*E was adjudged insolvent, and PCIGC stepped in to defend and indemnify Dr. Que. Thereafter, a dispute arose between the Igwilos and PCIGC concerning the number of \u201ccovered claims\u201d presented by the Igwilos in their complaint against Dr. Que. Specifically, the Igwilos contended that they had asserted three \u201ccovered claims,\u201d one for Mr. Igwilo, one for Mrs. Igwilo, and one for Ozioma Igwilo. PCIGC denied separate coverage for each of these claims and, instead, asserted that the claims aggregated to form one \u201ccovered claim.\u201d The Igwilos brought the declaratory judgment action <em>(Igwilo II) </em>to have the court determine the number of \u201ccovered claims\u201d implicated by their complaint in the underlying tort action <em>(Igwilo I).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b616-7\">The court ruled that the Igwilos had asserted \u201ctwo separate, distinct \u2018covered claims\u2019 \u201d in the underlying medical malpractice action. In its memorandum opinion, the court stated:</p>\n<p id=\"b617-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"635\">*635</page-number>The court finds that the language of Md.Code Ann., Ins. Art., \u00a7 9-302 and \u00a7 9-306 applies to any \u201ccovered claim\u201d that may result from the negligence of the insured and existing on or before insolvency of insurer. In the case sub judice, Plaintiffs assert two separate distinct \u201ccovered claims\u201d that arose as a result of the alleged negligence of Dr. Que, both of which existed before insolvency of P*I*E.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-5\">The parents\u2019 claim for injuries sustained by the mother, with resultant damage to marital relationship, and loss of child\u2019s services comprise one \u201ccovered claim,\u201d and the child\u2019s claim, for injuries sustained as a result of the claimed negligence constitute the second \u201ccovered claim.\u201d Therefore, these two claims are each considered a \u201ccovered claim\u201d within the meaning of Md.Code Ann., Ins. \u00a7 9-306.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-6\">In its order, the court held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b617-7\">The PCIGC\u2019s obligation, therefore, is to provide liability coverage up to $299,900 for each of the two \u201ccovered claims,\u201d asserted in the underlying litigation, i.e.: a) the injury to the child and all claims that are caused by, derive from or arise out of that bodily injury; and b) the injury to the mother and all claims that are caused by, derive from or arise out of that bodily injury.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b617-8\">The Igwilos appeal from the court\u2019s order, contending that the court erred in failing to find that they set forth three \u201ccovered claims\u201d in their complaint. PCIGC has cross-appealed, arguing that the court erred in failing to find that the Igwilos\u2019 complaint set forth a single \u201ccovered claim.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b617-9\">\n<em>Discussion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"aqn-dedup-1\">\n<em>Standard of Review</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b617-10\">The Court of Appeals has stated that \u201cthe proper standard for reviewing the granting of a summary judgment motion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"636\">*636</page-number>should be whether the trial court was legally correct.\u201d <em>Heat &amp; Power Corp. v. Air Prods. &amp; Chems., Inc., </em>320 Md. 584, 592, 578 A.2d 1202 (1990) (citations omitted). The purpose of the summary judgment procedure is not to try the case or to decide the factual disputes, but to decide whether there is an issue of fact that is sufficiently material to be tried. <em>See Coffey v. Derby Steel Co., </em>291 Md. 241, 247, 434 A.2d 564 (1981); <em>Berkey v. Delia, </em>287 Md. 302, 304, 413 A.2d 170 (1980). Thus, pursuant to Maryland Rule 2-501(e), summary judgment is appropriate only if there is no dispute of material fact and the party in whose favor judgment is entered is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. <em>See, e.g., Murphy v. Merzbacher, </em>346 Md. 525, 531, 697 A.2d 861 (1997); <em>Bowen v. Smith, </em>342 Md. 449, 454, 677 A.2d 81 (1996); <em>Rosenblatt v. Exxon Company, U.S.A., </em>335 Md. 58, 68, 642 A.2d 180 (1994); <em>McGraw v. Loyola Ford, Inc., </em>124 Md.App. 560, 572, 723 A.2d 502, <em>cert. denied, </em>353 Md. 473, 727 A.2d 382 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b618-4\">The summary judgment motion before the trial court involved the interpretation of a statute. This Court has held that the \u201cinterpretation of a statute presents a question of law.\u201d <em>Papillo v. Pockets, Inc., </em>119 Md.App. 78, 83, 704 A.2d 448 (1997). Neither party contends that any material facts were in dispute; therefore, we will review the trial court\u2019s decision <em>de novo </em>\u201cto determine whether the court reached the correct legal result.\u201d <em>Nicholson Air Services, Inc. v. Board of County Com\u2019rs of Allegany County, </em>120 Md.App. 47, 62, 706 A.2d 124 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b618-5\">\n<em>Relationship Between P*I*E and PCIGC</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b618-6\">PCIGC was created by the Maryland Legislature as a \u201cremedy for the particular societal malady caused by defunct insurance carriers.\u201d <em>Joe Shifflet, Inc. v. PCIGC, </em>77 Md.App. 706, 709, 551 A.2d 913 (1989). Under the statutory scheme, discussed in greater detail below, PCIGC supplants the insolvent insurer to fulfill \u201cthe obligations that the insolvent insurer should have fulfilled.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 710, 551 A.2d 913. PCIGC thus \u201cstands in the shoes of the insolvent insurer and[,] subject to applicable policy limits and conditions, is liable for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"637\">*637</page-number>\u2018covered claims\u2019 that could have been brought against the insurer.\u201d <em>McMichael v. Robertson, </em>77 Md.App. 208, 214, 549 A.2d 1157 (1988); <em>see also Maryland Ins. Guar. Ass\u2019n v. Muhl, </em>66 Md.App. 359, 361, 504 A.2d 637 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b619-4\">The Insurance Article of the Maryland Code sets forth the obligations of PCIGC. Section 9-302 provides that the purposes of the subtitle are:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b619-5\">(1) to provide a mechanism for the prompt payment of covered claims under certain policies and to avoid financial loss to residents of the State who are claimants or policyholders of an insolvent insurer; and (2) to provide for the assessment of the cost of payments of covered claims and protection among insurers.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b619-6\">The powers and duties of PCIGC are provided in \u00a7 9-306. Section 9~306(a)(l) provides that, subject to a statutory cap, PCIGC is \u201cobligated to the extent of the covered claims existing on or before the determination of the insolvency\u201d or to certain covered claims that arise after the insolvency. Section 9-306(a)(2) provides that PCIGC\u2019s obligation \u201cshall include only that amount of each covered claim that is in excess of $100 and less than $300,000.\u201d The statute further provides that PCIGC \u201cis not obligated to a policy holder or claimant in an amount in excess of the obligation of the insolvent insurer under the policy out of which the claim arises.\u201d \u00a7 9-306(a)(4). The trial court and all parties agreed that PCIGC\u2019s maximum liability per \u201ccovered claim\u201d is $299,-900.00.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-7\">Clearly, the concept of a \u201ccovered claim\u201d is central to this statutory scheme. Section 9-301(d) defines a \u201ccovered claim\u201d as \u201can insolvent insurer\u2019s unpaid obligation ... that ... arises out of a policy of the insolvent insurer.\u201d Therefore, to determine whether a claim constitutes a \u201ccovered claim\u201d under the statute, we must examine the language of the underlying insurance policy between PCIGC and the insolvent insurer. The insolvent insurer\u2019s obligation under its policy to the insured determines the insurer\u2019s \u201cunpaid obligation,\u201d which in turn determines what constitutes a \u201ccovered claim.\u201d As ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"638\">*638</page-number>plied in this ease, P*I*E\u2019s obligation to Dr. Que under its insurance policy constitutes its \u201cunpaid obligation.\u201d PCIGC\u2019s obligation to pay a \u201ccovered claim\u201d subject to the statutory cap is therefore the same as P*I*E\u2019s original contractual obligation under its policy with Dr. Que.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-4\">\n<em>P*I*E Insurance Policy</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b620-5\">Under the policy issued to Dr. Que, P*I*E\u2019s obligation is limited by the Limits of Liability provision applicable to \u201ceach claim.\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b620-6\">The Limit of Liability stated in the General Declarations, as applicable to \u201ceach claim,\u201d is the limit of [P*I*E\u2019s] liability for all damages because of any one claim or suit or all claims or suits first made during the Policy period because of injury to or death of any one person....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b620-7\">Thus, as it applies to this case, P*I*E\u2019s liability is limited to $1,000,000.00 \u201cfor all damages because of ... all claims or suits ... because of injury to ... <em>any one person.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b620-8\">On appeal, PCIGC argues that, \u201c[rjegardless of the number of claims or tort claimants, if there is one bodily injury, only one \u2018each claim\u2019 limit applies to all claims related to that bodily injury. Regardless of the number of claims or tort claimants, if there is one bodily injury, the most P*I*E Mutual was obligated to pay for <em>all </em>those claims was $1,000,000.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) On the contrary, the Igwilos contend that the word \u201ceach\u201d in the liability limitation means that every claim is individually subject to the liability cap, regardless of whether the claims all relate to or arise from bodily injury to one person. The Igwilos further contend that, under the Section II, Paragraph 2 of the policy, any additional claims for damages resulting from the same injury are considered separate claims. Upon reviewing the statute, the underlying insurance policy, and applicable case law, we reject the Igwi-los\u2019 contention and agree with PCIGC.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-9\">As the Court of Appeals recognized in <em>Daley v. United Services, </em>312 Md. 550, 553, 541 A.2d 632 (1988), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"639\">*639</page-number>\u201c[u]nder policies fixing a maximum recovery for \u2018bodily injury\u2019 to one person, the vast majority of courts have held that such a \u2018per person\u2019 liability limitation applies to all claims of damage flowing from such bodily injury.\u201d (Citing Annotation, <em>Construction and Application of Provision in Liability Policy Limiting the Amount of Insurer\u2019s Liability to One Person, </em>13 A.L.R.3d 1228, 1234 (1967 &amp; Supp.1987).) In such circumstances, \u201call damage claims, direct and consequential, resulting from injury to one person, are subject to the limitation.\u201d 13 A.L.R.3d at 1234 (1967 &amp; Supp.1999). Indeed, courts have \u201cuniformly\u201d taken the position that \u201cthe limit as to recovery for the bodily injuries of one person limits all recovery for damages consequential on that bodily injury, regardless of the fact that such damages are claimed by one who himself suffered bodily injury.\u201d 13 A.L.R.3d at 1240 (1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b621-4\">In <em>Daley, </em>the insurance policy at issue contained limitations quite similar to the one in this case:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b621-5\">Limits of Liability: The limit of bodily injury liability stated in the Declarations as applicable to \u201ceach person\u201d is the limit of the company\u2019s liability for all damages, including damages for care and loss of service, arising out of bodily injury sustained by one person as the result of any one occurrence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b621-6\">Coverage \u2014 Limits of Liability</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b621-7\">A. Bodily Injury Liability each person \u2014 $100,000.00\u2014 Each Occurrence \u2014 $200,000.00.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b621-8\"><em>Daley, </em>312 Md. at 552, 541 A.2d 632.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-9\">After reviewing the language of the policy in <em>Daley, </em>the Court summarized the insurer\u2019s obligation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b621-10\">[The obligation] was subject to two limits: (1) a $100,000 \u201ceach person\u201d limit for all damages, including damages for care and loss of services arising out of bodily injury sustained by one person as the result of any one occurrence; and (2) a $200,000 \u201ceach occurrence\u201d limit for all such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"640\">*640</page-number>damages arising out of bodily injuries sustained by two or more persons as a result of any one occurrence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b622-5\"><em>Daley, </em>312 Md. at 552, 541 A.2d 632. The Court later pointed out that \u201c[w]here state law creates a right to damag\u00e9s for mental anguish suffered by those in specified relationships to the person who suffers bodily injury or death, it has been held that the damages for mental anguish are, in effect, derivative of the single bodily injury.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 554, 541 A.2d 632.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-6\">The provision in the underlying insurance policy in this case is strikingly similar to that in <em>Daley. </em>The Limits of Liability provisions divide P*I*E\u2019s liability into two categories: (1) \u201ceach claim\u201d liability, which applies when one person has died or been injured, and (2) \u201cannual aggregate\u201d liability, which \u201cis the total limit of [P*I*E\u2019s] liability for all damages and for all claims first made during the effective Policy period, subject to the above provisions respecting \u2018each claim\u2019 \u201d liability. Thus, the $1,000,000.00 cap in the insurance policy represents the maximum liability for all claims arising from the death of or injury to one person, regardless of the number of claims that arise out of that injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-7\">The Igwilos\u2019 reliance on Section II, Paragraph 2, of the P*I*E insurance policy is unpersuasive. That provision states: \u201cIf any claim is first made during the Policy period alleging injury to an individual that would be covered by this Policy, any additional claim made for damages resulting from the same injury shall be considered a claim hereunder.\u201d As the Court of Appeals has recognized, \u201c[ujnder Maryland law, when deciding the issue of coverage under an insurance policy, the primary principle of construction is to apply the terms of the insurance contract itself.\u201d <em>Bausch &amp; Lomb v. Utica Mutual, </em>330 Md. 758, 779, 625 A.2d 1021 (1993); <em>see also Kendall v. Nationwide, </em>348 Md. 157, 166, 702 A.2d 767 (1997) (\u201cWe have repeatedly held that the construction of insurance contracts in Maryland is confined to the few well-established principles that are applied to the construction of contracts generally.\u201d). Moreover, \u201cparticular provisions of a contract are not to be read in isolation but rather the document is to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"641\">*641</page-number>read as a whole to discover its true import.\u201d <em>Simkins Indus., Inc. v. Lexington Ins. Co., </em>42 Md.App. 396, 404, 401 A.2d 181, <em>cert. denied, </em>285 Md. 730 (1979); <em>see also Klein v. Fidelity, </em>117 Md.App. 317, 331-32, 700 A.2d 262 (1997), <em>cert. denied, </em>348 Md. 333, 703 A.2d 1265 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b623-5\">The fundamental flaw in the Igwilos\u2019 reliance on Section II, Paragraph two, of the P*I*E policy is that the provision does not stand in isolation; rather, it must be read in conjunction with the Limits of Liability provision in the policy. Although each of the claims arising from an injury to one person constitute a separate claim under the policy, liability for each of these claims is limited to <em>all damages </em>because of <em>all claims </em>arising out of injury to any one person. Therefore, even though the claims are \u201cseparate,\u201d liability is capped for all claims resulting from the same injury. That cap constitutes the insurer\u2019s obligation under the policy, which then becomes a \u201ccovered claim\u201d under Md.Code \u00a7 9-301(d). We simply note that determining what constitutes a \u201cclaim\u201d under the policy does not resolve the issue of what constitutes a \u201ccovered claim\u201d under the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-6\">As all parties agree, the central issue in this appeal involves a dispute over the number of \u201ccovered claims\u201d that are before the trial court. Indeed, the declaratory judgment action <em>(.Igwilo II) </em>was filed to resolve that very issue. The Igwilos contend that there are three \u201ccovered claims\u201d before the trial court, whereas PCIGC contends that the Igwilos\u2019 separate claims for relief aggregated into a single \u201ccovered claim.\u201d As we discuss below, we find that the lower court correctly determined that the Igwilos presented two \u201ccovered claims.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b624-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"642\">*642</page-number>\n<em>I. Injury to the Child, Ozioma Igwilo</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b624-4\">All parties agree that the claimed physical injury to Ozioma Igwilo constitutes a \u201ccovered claim.\u201d Thus, the $1,000,000.00 limitation on liability in the P*I*E insurance policy would have applied to Ozioma\u2019s claims for damages, <em>as well as </em>all claims that arose because of Ozioma\u2019s bodily injury.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> As we discuss in greater detail below, the claims of Mr. and Mrs. Igwilo for economic and non-economic damages resulting from their child\u2019s injury are subject to the same liability cap as Ozioma\u2019s injuries, as they are all claims arising out of an injury to one person and do not constitute separate \u201ccovered claims\u201d subject to separate liability caps. Regardless of the number of tort claims arising from the child\u2019s bodily injury, the most P*I*E* would have been obligated to pay under the policy would have been the $1,000,000.00 \u201ceach claim\u201d limit. Thus, the most the PCIGC is obligated to pay is $299,900.00 for all tort claims arising from the child\u2019s injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-5\">\n<em>II. Injury to the Parents,</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b624-6\">\n<em>Ueheehukwu Angela Igwilo and Charles Igwilo</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b624-7\">Although the parties agree that the claim for injury to Ozioma Igwilo constitutes a \u201ccovered claim,\u201d the Igwilos and PCIGC sharply dispute whether the Igwilos\u2019 claims for injuries to Mr. and Mrs. Igwilo constitute separately \u201ccovered claims.\u201d Specifically, the parties disagree as to the following issues: (1) whether Mrs. Igwilo set forth a claim for her own physical injuries independent of Ozioma\u2019s physical injury; (2) whether Mr. and Mrs. Igwilo can recover economic and non-economic damages resulting from injury to Ozioma; and (3) whether the parents\u2019 claims for economic and non-economic damages constitute a \u201ccovered claim\u201d separate from the bodily injury claim(s).</p>\n<p id=\"b625-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"643\">*643</page-number>\n<em>A. Bodily Injury to Mrs. Igwilo</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b625-4\">PCIGC argues that \u201cthe complaint in the underlying tort action sought damages for one bodily injury (the child\u2019s).\u201d If this is the case, then PCIGC\u2019s potential liability would be limited to a total of $299,900.00 for the child\u2019s injury and all tort claims arising from that injury, as we have previously discussed, and PCIGC would not be liable at all for any physical injury to Mrs. Igwilo. PCIGC concedes, however, that, \u201cif the complaint in the underlying tort action sought damages because of two independent bodily injuries (one to the mother and one to the child), then the trial [court] was correct in its ruling that there were two \u2018covered claims.\u2019 \u201d The Igwilos maintain on appeal that their complaint in <em>Igwilo I </em>did assert a claim and sought damages \u201cfor the \u2018physical pain\u2019 and other damages\u201d arising from Dr. Que\u2019s negligence. To resolve this issue, we must examine the Igwilos\u2019 initial complaint in <em>Igwilo I.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b625-5\">In count one of the complaint, Mr. and Mrs. Igwilo, \u201con behalf of their infant child,\u201d sought damages for Ozioma\u2019s physical, emotional, and economic injuries. Prior to detailing Ozioma\u2019s injuries, count one chronicled Mrs. Igwilo\u2019s pregnancy with Ozioma, including a description of the physical pain and other symptoms she experienced during her pregnancy. The Igwilos stated in count one that Mrs. Igwilo suffered pain, severe swelling of the face and extremities, headache, epigas-tric pain, severe preeclampsia, severe toxemia, and an emergency cesarean section. The Igwilos did not seek damages for Mrs. Igwilo\u2019s physical pain and suffering in count one; rather, the relief sought was limited to damages for Ozioma Igwilo\u2019s injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-6\">In count two, however, the Igwilos made a \u201cclaim for their individual damages, expenses and losses against\u201d Dr. Que. In detailing their damages in count two, the Igwilos explicitly asserted that \u201c[t]he plaintiffs [Mr. and Mrs. Igwilo] ... have in the past, are presently, and will in the future suffer physical pain.... \u201d The Igwilos also incorporated \u201cby reference each and every allegation set forth [in count one] above, as though <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"644\">*644</page-number>fully restated\u201d in count two. We hold that the complaint sufficiently set forth a claim for Mrs. Igwilo\u2019s physical injury.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Therefore, under the insurance policy and the PCIGC statute, Mrs. Igwilo\u2019s physical injury amounted to a second \u201ccovered claim,\u201d independent of Ozioma\u2019s claim for bodily injury. Accordingly, we affirm the court\u2019s judgment that the \u201cclaim for injuries sustained by the mother, with resultant damage to the marital relationship\u201d constituted a second \u201ccovered claim.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b626-5\">\n<em>B. Parents\u2019 Claims for Economic and Non-economic Damages</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b626-6\">Both Mr. and Mrs. Igwilo asserted claims for economic and non-economic damages resulting from Ozioma\u2019s injury. Specifically, they asserted damages for pre-majority medical expenses and the loss of their infant daughter\u2019s services. As the Igwilos state in their brief to this Court, \u201cMr. Igwilo [and] Mrs. Igwilo ... had \u2018separate and distinct\u2019 claims against an alleged tortfeasor, Dr. Que, resulting, <em>inter alia, </em>from physical injuries to a minor child.... \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b626-7\">On appeal, the Igwilos argue that \u201c[pjarents of a minor child injured by someone\u2019s negligence have \u2018separate and distinct\u2019 claims for \u2018legally cognizable damages\u2019 ... that may either be joined in a single action with the minor child\u2019s claim or filed as separate actions.\u201d <em>See Johns Hopkins Hosp. v. Pepper, </em>346 Md. 679, 689, 697 A.2d 1358 (1997); <em>Garay v. Overholtzer, </em>332 Md. 339, 354-55, 631 A.2d 429 (1993). Thus, the Igwilos maintain, the claims of Mr. and Mrs. Igwilo for economic and non-economic damages resulting from Ozioma\u2019s injury are separately \u201ccovered claims.\u201d We disagree with the Igwilos\u2019 conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-8\">Whether the parents\u2019 claims for economic and non-economic damages constitute claims \u201cseparate\u201d from Ozioma\u2019s is immaterial in this case; as our previous discussion demonstrates, they do not constitute separate <em>\u201ccovered </em>claims\u201d under the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"645\">*645</page-number>insurance policy and the statute. The Igwilos\u2019 argument fails, therefore, because it does not take into account the terms of the policy. Mr. and Mrs. Igwilo\u2019s claims are derived from Ozioma\u2019s bodily injury; this is precisely the type of claim that, while legally distinct, is essentially combined with the claim for \u201cinjury to or death of any one person\u201d to constitute one \u201cunpaid obligation\u201d under the policy and, therefore, one \u201ccovered claim\u201d under the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-5\">We find that Mr. and Mrs. Igwilo may be able to recover economic and non-economic damages resulting from bodily injury to Ozioma and to Mrs. Igwilo.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> That recovery is limited, however, by the terms of the insurance policy and the statute governing PCIGC. The claim for damages for Ozioma\u2019s injury and all of the claims that derive from it (including the parents\u2019 claims for pre-majority medical expenses and loss of services) constitute one \u201ccovered claim.\u201d PCIGC\u2019s liability for that \u201ccovered claim\u201d is therefore limited by a single statutory cap. Similarly, all claims derived from the independent bodily injury to Mrs. Igwilo, including the claim for loss of consortium, constitute the second \u201ccovered claim.\u201d Thus, a second liability cap applies to this \u201ccovered claim.\u201d Accordingly, we affirm the trial court\u2019s judgment that \u201cPCIGC\u2019s obligation ... is to provide liability coverage up to $299,900 for each of the two \u2018covered claims,\u2019 asserted in the underlying litigation____\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b628-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"646\">*646</page-number>\n<em>Conclusion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b628-4\">We hold that the Igwilos asserted two \u201ccovered claims\u201d in their complaint in the underlying tort action. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the lower court.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-5\">JUDGMENT AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-6\">COSTS TO BE PAID BY APPELLANTS.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b615-11\">. PCIGC filed a cross-appeal in this case which raises two issues. First, PCIGC contends that the Igwilos' claims should have been aggregated into one \u201ccovered claim\u201d rather than two \u201ccovered claims.\u201d This issue is essentially PCIGC's position regarding the first question presented in the Igwilos\u2019 appeal. Therefore, we address the general issue of how many \u201ccovered claims\u201d are before the trial court without regard to whether the discussion is in the context of the Igwilos' appeal or PCIGC\u2019s cross-appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-12\">Second, PCIGC \"noted the cross-appeal out of an abundance of caution to protect its rights because the Igwilos have contended ... that the trial court\u2019s memorandum supports their position and is controlling. The PCIGC perfected the appeal to preserve the issue of whether a trial memorandum supersedes or explains the trial court\u2019s order.\u201d As our discussion in this opinion will reveal, it is not necessary to address this issue. Although the court\u2019s order and memorandum opinion slightly differ in their respective analyses, both reach the ultimate conclusion that the Igwilos have two \"covered claims.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b617-11\">. PCIGC concedes, however, that, if the Igwilos set forth a separate cause of action for Mrs. Igwilo\u2019s personal injuries, the Igwilos actually have two \u201ccovered claims.\u201d If that is the case, then PCIGC argues that the trial court\u2019s judgment should be affirmed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b623-7\">. The trial court in <em>Igwilo II </em>specifically stated that \"[t]his declaratory judgment is confined solely to the issue of the number of 'covered claims\u2019 that are asserted by the Igwilos in <em>[Igwilo </em>/]\u2022 This declaratory judgment does not attempt to adjudicate or address the merits of the [Igwilos\u2019] claims in the underlying litigation <em>[Igwilo </em>/].\u201d Likewise, this Court will not address the merits of the Igwilos' claims. As PCIGC points out in its brief to this Court, \"[t]he proper forum for the issue of whether the Igwilos have a cause of action for [non-economic] damages arising out of the non-fatal bodily injury of their child is the medical malpractice action brought by them against Dr. Que.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b624-8\">. Because P*I*E has become insolvent, PCIGC will now assume that obligation, subject to the statutory cap provided in the Maryland Code, \u00a7 9-306(a)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b626-9\">. Accordingly, the Igwilos need not \"amend the complaint,\u201d as PCIGC suggests, to \"assert a claim by Mrs. Igwilo to recover damages for any independent bodily injury she may have suffered....\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b627-6\">. We reiterate that we will not address the merits of the Igwilos' claims in this opinion. We simply hold that recovery on their two \"covered claims\u201d is permissible, subject to the statutory cap.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b627-7\">. The trial court\u2019s order properly stated that the two \"covered claims\u201d were: \"a) the injury to the child and all claims that are caused by, derive from or arise out of that bodily injury; and b) the injury to the mother and all claims that are caused by, derive from or arise out of that bodily injury.\u201d In its memorandum opinion, however, the court stated that \"[t]he parents\u2019 claim for injuries sustained by the mother, with resultant damage to marital relationship, <em>and loss of child's services </em>comprise one \u2018covered claim,\u2019 and the child\u2019s claim for injuries sustained as a result of the claimed negligence constitute the second \u2018covered claim.\u2019 \u201d (emphasis added). Based on our discussion, the court\u2019s division of the claims in the order, not the memorandum <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"646\">*646</page-number>opinion, was correct; the loss of services is derived from the child\u2019s injury and therefore is part of the \u201ccovered claim\u201d resulting from Ozioma's bodily injury and not the bodily injury to Mrs. Igwilo. The court's erroneous statement in its memorandum opinion is immaterial, however, as we affirm the court\u2019s final conclusion, consistent in the order and the opinion, that the Igwilos have two \"covered claims\u201d under the insurance policy and the statute.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
