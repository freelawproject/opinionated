After he was sentenced to a term of twenty-five years without parole for the use of a handgun <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>during the commission of a crime of violence conviction, to a term of ten consecutive years for the second degree assault conviction, to an additional term of five consecutive years for the possession of a firearm after being convicted of a crime of violence conviction, and to a concurrent term of five years for the reckless endangerment conviction,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> he noted this appeal. On appeal, we are presented with the following question:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AmEB\">Did the trial judge err in refusing to grant a mistrial in light of the apparent incompetence or unwillingness of a juror to effectively participate in jury deliberations, dismissing that juror, and subsequently allowing that juror to participate in jury deliberations upon discovering that no alternate jurors were available?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b511-5\">We shall answer \u201cyes,\u201d and reverse the judgments of the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-6\">Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b511-7\">As the underlying facts are irrelevant to the issue presented by appellant, we shall not recount them. The only issue before us involves the trial court\u2019s encounter with an uncooperative juror during jury deliberations.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-8\">At the close of evidence and oral argument, the trial court instructed the jury and dismissed the alternate juror. The jury then retired to begin deliberations. In approximately three hours, a note containing three questions was received from the jury. The trial court answered two of them, but did not answer the question of what would happen if the jury was unable to reach a decision on all counts. When the jury was directed to return to its deliberations, Juror # 3 was asked to remain in the court room. In the presence of defense counsel and the defendant, the following exchange ensued:</p>\n<p id=\"b511-9\"><em>The Court: </em>Ms. Watkins?</p>\n<p id=\"b512-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number><em>Juror </em># <em>3: </em>Urn-hum.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-5\"><em>The Court: </em>I\u2019ve just noticed over this .little bit of time that you don\u2019t seem comfortable or happy. You seem a little angry. I mean, I\u2019ve been a judge for 15 years and you\u2019ve got to sense or see things pretty quickly, even by body language. And you were saying things just as you came out and I overheard \u2014 I\u2019m not quite sure what you said, but it didn\u2019t sound like you were a happy camper.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-6\"><em>Juror </em># <em>3: </em>I asked her to write down to ask you could one of us leave, you know, could one of us just leave. I mean, can we leave? I mean, can I leave?</p>\n<p id=\"b512-7\"><em>The Court: </em>Well, you have to tell me why you want to leave?</p>\n<p id=\"b512-8\"><em>Juror </em># <em>3: </em>Because they\u2019re not sticking to the issue here, to me. I think if they stick to the issue, what we are supposed to, maybe we can come to some kind of agreement. They just don\u2019t want to\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b512-9\"><em>The Court: </em>Okay. Because you have 11, if you have 11 jurors who think they are sticking to the issue\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b512-10\"><em>Juror </em># <em>3: </em>They\u2019re not.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-11\"><em>The Court: </em>But if 11 think they are and one thinks they\u2019re not, would that tell you something?</p>\n<p id=\"b512-12\"><em>Juror </em># <em>3: </em>If we were sticking to the issue, it wouldn\u2019t take that long, don\u2019t you think so?</p>\n<p id=\"b512-13\"><em>The Court: </em>Well, I think the question is whether\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b512-14\"><em>Juror </em># <em>3: </em>All right. I\u2019ll stay.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-15\"><em>The Court: </em>Just a minute. I\u2019m not trying to twist your arm to stay. That would be equally wrong. Okay? The question is whether, if you feel that you\u2019re not able to reason with them and listen to them, not to surrender yourself to them, but to listen to them, that\u2019s a serious matter because it really would thwart the jury process. It would be the same as if a judge were to come out and the lawyers were all sitting there ready to argue their case and the judge said, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>\u201cI\u2019m just not going to listen to you. I\u2019ve made up my mind.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b513-5\"><em>Juror </em># <em>3: </em>You know why I ain\u2019t listening to them? Because they don\u2019t listen to me. When I say something, they don\u2019t listen to me.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-6\"><em>The Court: </em>If I did that, then I would be wrong, and if you did that, you would be wrong. And judges sometimes have to sit in groups of judges, too. They sit on what we call panels and we basically\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b513-7\"><em>Defense Attorney: </em>Your Honor, I don\u2019t mean to interject, but\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b513-8\"><em>The Court: </em>I know where I am. So I want you to give some thought to it and I should tell you what I will tell the entire jury panel, what I did not say that I meant to say about one of the questions here, \u201cWhat happens if we can\u2019t reach a decision on all counts?\u201d I think I won\u2019t continue with that until I\u2019ve talked to the lawyers about that.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-9\">Do you want to just go over and have a seat there and just think about what I\u2019ve said? Would you mind sitting way at the end there just so we don\u2019t overhear one another and we don\u2019t bother you in your thinking?</p>\n<p id=\"b513-10\"><em>Prosecutor: </em>Judge, my suggestion is just get her back in and try to start deliberating again.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-11\"><em>The Court: </em>But there is certainly precedent for excusing jurors who are not cooperating in the jury process and I have no hesitation in doing that.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-12\"><em>Defense Attorney: </em>Well\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b513-13\"><em>The Court: </em>I understand your position and I understand you\u2019ll take exception to it because you\u2019re going to deduce what her position is.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-14\"><em>Defense Attorney: </em>Well, I\u2019m not sure \u2014 see, my problem with this whole conversation is I\u2019m not sure that we understand what her problem is. I don\u2019t think its that she\u2019s not participating. She\u2019s come to a decision one way or the other, which she is entitled to.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number><em>The Court: </em>No, she didn\u2019t say that. She said, \u201cThey\u2019re not listening to me. Why should I listen to them?\u201d I deduce from that that she\u2019s not listening to them.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-5\"><em>Defense Attorney: </em>Well, I think that we\u2019re treading on thin waters \u2014 thin ice when we say, you know, \u201cThe 11 think this and so maybe you should listen to them\u201d because maybe she\u2019s not. I mean, she could be whatever. I don\u2019t know whether she is for the State or for the defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-6\"><em>The Court: </em>With your permission, the question was put to the forelady who made it very clear that it was one person and there is no doubt who it is. So that\u2019s not even an issue and, of course, there is nothing morally or legally or technically -wrong -with one person reaching a decision different from 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-7\"><em>Defense Attorney: </em>That\u2019s right.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-8\"><em>The Court: </em>But it\u2019s not been told to them yet, by the way, well let me finish that thought. There\u2019s nothing wrong -with one person being different from the other 11, but what is wrong and what I will not accept is a juror who is simply not participating in the process. That is not going to be acceptable to me, I don\u2019t care what side of the fence she is on.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-9\"><em>Defense Attorney: </em>But I don\u2019t think we know that.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-10\"><em>The Court: </em>I think we know it because the forelady said it and she has said it, too. I don\u2019t know what better evidence there is than the very two people who are, in effect, saying the same thing.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-11\">But let me go on to chapter two of this while we\u2019re all here. I have not fully answered the question about \u201cWhat happens if we cannot reach a decision on all counts?\u201d I really didn\u2019t emphasize \u2014 meaning that maybe they have a decision on some counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-12\"><em>Defense Attorney: </em>Well, I thought the problem was one through six. Maybe that\u2019s why I thought the problem was\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b514-13\"><em>The Court: </em>Well, that\u2019s a fair comment to make. I didn\u2019t read it that way. Well, I don\u2019t mind \u2014 I\u2019ll bring them back <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>and talk about that. I didn\u2019t say something that\u2019s important, which is a mistrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-5\"><em>Defense Attorney: </em>Right.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-6\"><em>The Court: </em>All right. Let me bring them back.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-7\">Juror number three, do you have any additional thoughts you want to share with us before we bring the jury back in?</p>\n<p id=\"ajl-dedup-1\"><em>Juror </em># <em>3: </em>No.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-8\"><em>The Court: </em>What?</p>\n<p id=\"b515-9\"><em>Juror </em># <em>3: </em>No.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-10\"><em>The Court: </em>Do you want to stay and continue to serve, or do you want to be excused?</p>\n<p id=\"b515-11\"><em>Juror </em># <em>3: </em>I want to be excused.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-12\"><em>The Court: </em>I\u2019m sorry. You better come up and talk to us because it is not on the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-13\">(Juror # 3 approached the bench.)</p>\n<p id=\"b515-14\"><em>Juror </em># <em>3: </em>I said, can I be excused?</p>\n<p id=\"b515-15\"><em>The Court: </em>And the reason?</p>\n<p id=\"b515-16\"><em>Defense Attorney: </em>Well, could I make a suggestion, Your Honor? Could you make the other announcement first and then give her the opportunity to decide whether she still wants to be excused?</p>\n<p id=\"b515-17\"><em>The Court: </em>Well, she\u2019s already answered that question.</p>\n<p id=\"A4r2\"><em>Juror </em># <em>3: </em>I do want to be excused.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-18\"><em>The Court: </em>I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any doubt about that. What is the reason for? Do you feel that you can or cannot participate with this jury?</p>\n<p id=\"b515-19\"><em>Juror </em># <em>3: </em>I\u2019ll participate if they stick to the issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-20\"><em>The Court: </em>But other than that answer, can you give me a different answer, one that also reflects your thinking, because that one doesn\u2019t help me very much.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-21\"><em>Juror </em># <em>3: </em>I don\u2019t have a reason why.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-22\"><em>The Court: </em>What?</p>\n<p id=\"b515-23\"><em>Juror </em># <em>3: </em>I don\u2019t really have a reason why.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-24\"><em>The Court: </em>You don\u2019t have a reason why?</p>\n<p id=\"b516-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number><em>Juror # 3: </em>Why I want to leave. I just don\u2019t want to be with them.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-4\"><em>The Court: </em>You don\u2019t want to be with them?</p>\n<p id=\"b516-5\"><em>Juror </em># <em>3: </em>No.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-6\"><em>The Court: </em>You\u2019re having a hard time consulting with them and talking with them about the facts?</p>\n<p id=\"b516-7\"><em>Juror </em># <em>3: </em>I\u2019m not saying anything. It\u2019s not me, it\u2019s them. <em>The Court: </em>\u201cThem\u201d being all the other 11?</p>\n<p id=\"b516-8\"><em>Juror </em># <em>3: </em>I can\u2019t speak for the rest of them. You have to ask them.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-9\"><em>The Court: </em>Well, when you say \u201cthem,\u201d you mean the jurors in the jury room now, of which there are 11?</p>\n<p id=\"b516-10\"><em>Juror #3: </em>You have to ask them. I can only speak for myself.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-11\"><em>The Court: </em>How would they tell me why you\u2019re having\u2014 why you\u2019re uncomfortable on this jury? I think only you can tell us that.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-12\"><em>Juror </em># <em>3: </em>I\u2019m uncomfortable because they don\u2019t want you checking anything and instead of focusing on what we are supposed to be focusing on. I mean, maybe it will help us get out of here. That\u2019s how I look at it. I want to do what we\u2019ve got to do so I can get out of here.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-13\">At the conclusion of this exchange, the jury returned to the courtroom and the final question posed by the note was answered. The jury was then directed to return to its deliberations, but Juror # 3 was again asked to remain in the courtroom. Following the jury\u2019s departure, another exchange ensued:</p>\n<p id=\"b516-14\"><em>The Court: </em>Now, having heard what I just said, does that influence your thinking?</p>\n<p id=\"b516-15\"><em>Juror </em># <em>3: </em>There\u2019s nothing wrong with my thinking.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-16\"><em>The Court: </em>No, I didn\u2019t mean there is anything wrong with it. I\u2019m saying if it makes any difference to you.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-17\"><em>Juror </em># <em>3: </em>Yeah, if it makes any difference, you know. If they do like you say, I mean, there shouldn\u2019t be no problem.</p>\n<p id=\"AtIs\"><em>The Court: </em>What did I just say that\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b517-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number><em>Juror </em># <em>3: </em>You said if we can come to some kind of agreement on a couple of them, not all of them, but some of them. That\u2019s fine. But I bet they didn\u2019t.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-4\"><em>The Court: </em>But you bet they didn\u2019t?</p>\n<p id=\"b517-5\"><em>Juror </em># <em>3: </em>Um-hum. Okay. That\u2019s fine.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-6\"><em>The Court: </em>So now with that clarification, do you want to continue on this jury and continue \u2014 you\u2019re saying \u201cno\u201d? <em>Juror </em># <em>3: </em>No, I don\u2019t but ain\u2019t no way I can get out of it, is there?</p>\n<p id=\"b517-7\"><em>The Court: </em>Yes, by my excusing you.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-8\"><em>Juror </em># <em>3: </em>Well, can you excuse me, please?</p>\n<p id=\"b517-9\"><em>The Court: </em>If I felt that you were not going to \u2014 if I felt that you weren\u2019t comfortable with this jury in the way that I\u2019ve asked you to perform your duty, which is to be part of \u2014 you don\u2019t have to be best friends, but be part of a process where you\u2019re listening to one another and you\u2019re open to the views of other people, if I felt you couldn\u2019t do that \u2014 and no one is wagging a finger at you like you\u2019re a bad person. It\u2019s only a question of your mental attitude.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-10\">All of us have been in situations where we felt we were not able to really be part of the process because of all sorts of reasons and it is not that unusual. If that is your state of mind, you see, because if that is your state of mind and you tell me that and you feel you can\u2019t be part of this jury, is what it amounts to, then I\u2019m going to have to honor that, but I can\u2019t put words in your mouth and I can\u2019t say, without you\u2019re saying it, that you can\u2019t participate. I can\u2019t say that.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-11\">There\u2019s nothing wrong with \u2014 I mean if there are differences, that\u2019s part of the jury process and no juror is required to be in lock step with everybody else, but as they march down that road to a decision, they do march down together and they are listening to one another talk about the evidence and the law, and they\u2019re listening to the people express their opinions and they\u2019re open to why they have those opinions and they wonder if this is something that should influence their decision, but they don\u2019t surrender their convictions either -without having that information <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>unless the change is caused by an intelligent process of your own, which comes about after you\u2019ve listened to other people, if it comes about at all.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-5\">That\u2019s the process I\u2019m talking about, and if you\u2019re not able or willing to participate in the process that way, then you would be excused, but only you can tell me if you can or cannot.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-6\"><em>Juror </em># <em>3: </em>What your saying, if I can sit down and listen to them? I mean, but why\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b518-7\"><em>The Court: </em>Well, they listen to you, too.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-8\"><em>Juror #3: </em>They ain\u2019t listening to me, because I already gave them my verdict. This is, like, we got the \u2014 okay? We wrote down the numbers of it and we just put whatever, right? They got mine. It\u2019s them. And I ain\u2019t changing my mind. That\u2019s all to it.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-9\"><em>The Court: </em>It\u2019s not a question about you changing your mind.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-11\"><em>Juror #3: </em>Well, I have nothing else to say. They got mine. It\u2019s them. You need to be saying that to them that\u2019s in there chit-chatting.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-13\"><em>The Court: </em>Ma\u2019am, it\u2019s not a question of whether you change your mind on the decision in the case that you may have reached. The question is whether you\u2019ll change your mind by listening to other people. If you can\u2019t do that, then you will be excused.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-14\"><em>Juror </em># <em>3: </em>I can\u2019t listen to them.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-15\"><em>The Court: </em>Then you\u2019re excused.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-16\">At this juncture, although Juror # 3 retrieved her belongings, she remained in the courtroom. Defense counsel then stated, \u201cI would make a motion for mistrial, Your Honor. I just think \u2014 well, I\u2019ve never seen this done and I just feel that what I hear her saying and you heard her saying was two different things.\u201d Defense counsel believed Juror # 3 was the \u201chold out,\u201d but the trial court believed she was simply not willing to participate in the jury\u2019s deliberations. Although Juror # 3 had been dismissed, upon learning from the forela-dy that a verdict had been reached on several of the nine <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>counts, the trial court suggested that a partial verdict be accepted. Defense counsel responded, \u201cI just think there\u2019s been too much communication with the jury, Your Honor. I\u2019m going to renew my motion for [mistrial]. I think the case should be retried with a new jury, in all fairness to Mr. Benjamin.\u201d The motion was denied, and the clerk was directed to recall the previously dismissed alternate juror. On learning that the alternate could not be reached, Juror # 3 was reseated and directed to join in the jury\u2019s deliberations, and she did so.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b519-5\">Approximately one half hour later, the jury reported that while it was deadlocked on four counts, it had reached a verdict on the remaining counts. On receiving this information, the trial court replied, \u201cif you spend just a little more time, you may end up breaking the deadlock on the other counts,\u201d and directed the jury to return on the following morning and resume its deliberations. At this point, Juror # 3 again asked to be excused, and the trial court responded that she could not. As the jurors were departing, the trial court again had Juror # 3 remain. Before beginning a conversation with Juror # 3, the trial court said to both attorneys and the defendant:</p>\n<p id=\"b519-6\">I have been a judge for 15 years and I\u2019ve been in drug court. I really do think she\u2019s on drugs, but, of course, I would think they would have worn off by now. I mean, it\u2019s 5:00, ten after 5:00. I do see symptoms. I don\u2019t mean that they\u2019re clear and unambiguous, but I did want to ask her. I\u2019m worried about what she\u2019ll do tomorrow. That\u2019s why I\u2019m asking.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-7\">... I mean, I see the symptoms. She acts very \u2014 she acts bizarrely. She\u2019s talking out loud to the forelady.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-8\">The trial court then conversed with Juror # 3:</p>\n<p id=\"b519-9\"><em>The Court: </em>I think that I\u2019m concerned about tomorrow. I don\u2019t want you to let me down.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number><em>Juror #3: </em>I\u2019ll be here. I was just letting them know tomorrow is Friday. I ain\u2019t trying to stay all day. Friday is my day.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-5\"><em>The Court: </em>Do you work ma\u2019am?</p>\n<p id=\"b520-6\"><em>Juror </em># <em>3: </em>No, I do not.

A short time later, a note was received from Juror # 3. The note said: \u201cI would appreciate it if you, the Judge, would let me leave for today. This in here is very frustrating ... I can\u2019t take no more.\u201d The trial court answered, \u201cThe answer must be no. Please work with this jury.\u201d Later that morning, the jury returned a verdict on eight of the nine counts. During numerous discussions with defense counsel and the trial court following each conversations with Juror # 3, defense counsel requested a new trial, on the grounds that not only had Juror # 3 been separated from the jury during its deliberations, but that the trial court had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>communicated excessively with Juror # 3. In addition, appellant contends Juror # 3 hung the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-5\">According to the trial transcript, the deliberations had continued in excess of six hours, and Juror # 3 was absent for more than thirty minutes of that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-6\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b523-7\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-8\">According to appellant, his motion for a mistrial should have been granted because, during deliberations, the trial court believed Juror # 3 was on drugs, incompetent, unwilling to participate in the jury\u2019s deliberations, and had missed a portion of the deliberations. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-9\">\u201c[A] request for a mistrial in a criminal case is addressed to the sound discretion of the trial court[.]\u201d <em>Wright v. State, </em>312 Md. 648, 654, 541 A.2d 988 (1988).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-10\">It has ... been repeatedly held that \u201ca trial judge shall declare a mistrial only under extraordinary circumstances and where there is a manifest necessity to do so.\u201d <em>Wilhelm v. State, </em>272 Md. 404, 429, 326 A.2d 707 (1974); <em>Russell v. State, </em>69 Md.App. 554, 562, 518 A.2d 1081 (1987). The record must compellingly demonstrate \u201cclear and egregious prejudice to the defendant\u201d to warrant such a drastic measure. <em>Leak v. State, </em>84 Md.App. 353, 358, 579 A.2d 788 (1990). <em>See also Lusby v. State, </em>217 Md. 191, 195, 141 A.2d 893 (1958). Because a trial judge is in the best position to evaluate whether or not a defendant\u2019s right to an impartial jury has been compromised, an appellate court will not disturb the trial court\u2019s decision on a motion for a mistrial or a new trial absent a clear abuse of discretion. <em>Wright v. State, </em>312 Md. 648, 654, 541 A.2d 988 (1988); <em>Hunt v. State, </em>312 Md. 494, 500-01, 540 A.2d 1125 (1988); <em>Wilhelm v. State, </em>272 Md. at 429, 326 A.2d 707.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b523-11\"><em>Allen v. State, </em>89 Md.App. 25, 42-43, 597 A.2d 489 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b523-12\">As we have noted, appellant\u2019s motions for a mistrial involved the trial court\u2019s extensive discussions with Juror # 3 during deliberations. While it is not unusual for a juror to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>dismissed, for cause or for inability to continue, most involve a seated juror being replaced by a duly selected alternate. <em>Hayes v. State, </em>355 Md. 615, 735 A.2d 1109 (1999); <em>Pollitt v. State, </em>344 Md. 318, 686 A.2d 629 (1996); <em>State v. Cook, </em>338 Md. 598, 659 A.2d 1313 (1995); <em>Stokes v. State, </em>72 Md.App. 673, 532 A.2d 189 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b524-5\">In the instant case, however, the trial court became aware of the problem with Juror # 3 after deliberations had begun, and the alternate had been dismissed. After questioning Juror # 3, the court believed she was not only unwilling to participate, but may have been \u201con drugs.\u201d Although Juror # 3 was dismissed, she was reseated in order for a jury of twelve to return a verdict, after defense counsel refused to accept a verdict from a jury of less than twelve. As we have noted, the jury continued to deliberate during the trial court\u2019s conversations with Juror #3. Not only is this situation unique, we have been unable to uncover a reported case in which a juror was dismissed, then reseated during deliberations. Hence, this is a case of first impression. For guidance, we shall review several cases involving the dismissal of a sworn juror. In <em>Pollitt, </em>344 Md. at 324-25, 686 A.2d 629, the Court of Appeals explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-6\">When such a situation arises in a criminal case, as here, courts commonly proceed in one of three ways. First, the court can declare a mistrial. Maryland Code (1957, 1996 Repl.Vol.) Article 27, \u00a7 594; e.g. <em>State v. Gorwell, </em>339 Md. 203, 217, 661 A.2d 718, 725 (1995)(\u201cThe loss of a juror due to illness or other proper cause \u2018justifies a discharge of a jury and declaring a mistrial.\u2019 \u201d) (quoting <em>Reemsnyder v. State, </em>46 Md.App. 249, 256, 416 A.2d 767, 771, <em>cert. denied, </em>288 Md. 741 (1980)) ... The court can also remove the juror and, with the consent of both parties, proceed with only eleven jurors. ' Md. Rule 4-311(b) ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-7\">Finally, the court can remove the juror and replace him or her with an alternate juror.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b524-8\">In <em>Pollitt, </em>a juror\u2019s \u201chearing impairment did not become evident until immediately after the jury had been sworn.\u201d 344 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>Md. at 322, 686 A.2d 629. As the original jury venire was still present in the courtroom and no alternate juror was available, \u201cthe court took advantage of the venire and sought to replace juror Ball with the next person on the jury list.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 325, 686 A.2d 629. Since defense counsel did not consent to the substitution, and the parties had not agreed to proceed with only eleven jurors, \u201cthe court had no choice but to declare a mistrial and to impanel a new jury.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 327, 686 A.2d 629.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-4\">In <em>Hayes, supra, </em>as in the case at hand, a problem with a juror arose after the jury had retired to begin its deliberations and the alternates had been dismissed. There, the Court of Appeals declared it to be error for the trial court to substitute an alternate juror for a sworn juror after the jury had retired to deliberate. <em>Hayes, </em>355 Md. at 635, 735 A.2d 1109. The Court relied \u2022 on Md. Rule 4-312(b)(3), which provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-5\">Any juror who, before the time the jury retires to consider its verdict, becomes or is found to be unable or disqualified to perform a juror\u2019s duty, shall be replaced by an alternate juror in the order of selection. An alternate juror who does not replace a juror shall be discharged when the jury retires to consider its verdict.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b525-6\">Applying Rule 4 \u2014 312(b)(3), the Court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-7\">[W]e conclude that an alternate juror who remains qualified to serve may be substituted for a regular juror who is properly discharged, until such time as the jury enters the jury room to consider its verdict and closes the door. We view the closing of the door as marking the point at which the ability to substitute ends ...</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b525-8\">355 Md. at 635, 735 A.2d 1109. In <em>Gorwell, supra, </em>when at the request of the defendant, a juror was dismissed during deliberations, and the State would not agree to proceed with eleven jurors, the trial court declared a mistrial. 339 Md. at 205, 661 A.2d 718. On appeal, the Court said \u201cthere was a manifest necessity for the declaration of a mistrial.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b525-9\">Turning to the case at hand, we shall examine the options available to the trial court under such circumstances. First, the alternate juror had been excused and had departed and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>thus could not replace Juror # 3. Not only had deliberations begun, they had been underway for some period of time. <em>See Hayes, supra. </em>Second, defense counsel would not agree to proceed with eleven jurors. Accordingly, there was a manifest necessity to declare a mistrial. <em>See Pollitt, supra </em>and <em>Gorwell, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b526-5\">While we are reluctant to disturb the denial0 of a motion for mistrial, we are here faced with rather unusual circumstances. After several conversations with Juror # 3, while the jury continued its deliberations, the trial court determined that Juror # 3 was possibly on drugs and was unwilling to participate in the deliberations. Nonetheless, Juror # 3 was reseated when the trial court learned that a partial verdict had been reached, although Juror # 3 had not participated in the entire deliberations.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-6\">Our purpose for including several lengthy excerpts from the trial transcript is to demonstrate the extent to which the trial court sought to avoid a mistrial, and to demonstrate the extent of the trial court\u2019s communications with Juror # 3, while the jury, in her absence, continued to deliberate. From this, it is obvious that Juror # 3 was not only unwilling to participate in the deliberations, she repeatedly asked to be excused. On one occasion, Juror # 3 said she would do whatever it would take to be able to leave. It appears, however, that on several occasions Juror # 3 was for all purposes coerced into rejoining the jury\u2019s deliberations. Moreover, during her third conversation with the trial court, Juror # 3 explained that she was still not participating, but was told to think about it overnight and return the next morning.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-7\">In sum, it appears that Juror # 3\u2019s lack of participation in the jury\u2019s deliberations, her desire to be excused, and her absence from deliberations, deprived appellant of his right to a fair trial before an impartial jury. Thus, the trial court abused its discretion in declining to declare a mistrial.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b527-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>JUDGMENTS REVERSED; COSTS TO BE PAID BY THE MAYOR AND COUNCIL OF BALTIMORE CITY.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b511-10\">.
