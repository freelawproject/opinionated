Johnson, </em>323 Md. 486, 593 A.2d 1133 (1991), which holds that the relocation of a child may constitute a change in circumstances sufficient to trigger a review of custody, applies a standard that violates a custodial parent\u2019s constitutional right to travel. Relying on the Supreme Court\u2019s recent decision in <em>Saenz v. Roe, </em>526 U.S. 489, 119 S.Ct. 1518, 143 L.Ed.2d 689 (1999), appellant argues that <em>the Domingues </em>standards must be modified.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Appellant further argues that we should reverse the decision of the Circuit Court for Harford County to transfer custody from Leslie K. Braun, appellant, to Jeffrey David Headley, appellee, after appellant\u2019s relocation from Maryland to Arizona, because the change in custody was not in the best interests of the child.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-6\">FACTS AND LEGAL PROCEEDINGS</p>\n<p id=\"b574-7\">The minor child, Theresa, was born on November 11, 1993. Appellant filed a complaint to prove paternity and establish child support on May 11, 1994, naming appellee as the father. Following the determination that appellee was the father, custody was awarded to appellant and appellee was ordered to pay approximately $316 monthly in child support.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Appellee was granted reasonable visitation, and subsequently, a visitation schedule was established. The visitation order of March 7, 1995, initially granted appellee visitation from 9:00 a.m. Saturday morning until 9:00 p.m. Saturday evening for two consecutive Saturdays, and then every other weekend with rotating holidays.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>On October 16, 1998, appellant moved to Arizona. On that same date, appellant filed a complaint to modify visitation stating that due to her \u201cchronic pain\u201d and \u201cillness,\u201d she had \u201cdecided to move\u201d to a \u201cdryer climate, which [would] enable her to better tolerate her various health problems.\u201d Appellant also contended in the motion that visitation should thereafter \u201cbe conditioned on [appellee] paying all transportation costs incident to such visitation, in advance; or, providing round-trip airline tickets for each scheduled visitation.\u201d Ap-pellee filed an answer and a counter-complaint for sole custody and/or for modification of custody, requesting an emergency custody hearing. A hearing was set for and held on December 16,1998, and the matter was continued. On December 17, 1998, the court ordered that assessments of both parties and Theresa be conducted by the Office of Family Court Services. On January 26, 1999, the hearing was held to receive the report of John Mahlmann, Ph.D, of the Office of Family Court Services. Dr. Mahlmann interviewed the parties and Theresa, and recommended that \u201cboth parties attend the Divorce Education Program\u201d and that each party have a \u201cpsychological evaluation.\u201d After receiving the report from the doctor, the court concluded that a trial was necessary. The court ordered that appellant, appellee, and Theresa each have a psychological evaluation by Dr. Michael Gombatz, and the evaluations were scheduled.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Subsequently, the court appointed an attorney for Theresa. A two-day trial was held in mid-April.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-5\">At the trial, Dr. Gombatz\u2019s report was admitted into evidence. Dr. Gombatz reported that on February 23, 1999, for the scheduled joint interview with both parties, appellant \u201cwas approximately a half hour to an hour late.\u201d He stated that appellant \u201cinterrupted several times\u201d during appellee\u2019s presentation. He stated that appellant was \u201cinflexible unless it was to her advantage,\u201d and that she \u201cwas consistently vague and non-responsive ... [and] it appeared that [appellant] did deny [appellee] visitation, rationalizing the reasons for it.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>After conversing with Dr. Mahlmann, Dr. Gombatz reported that there was no record of any current significant health conditions facing Theresa, contradicting appellant\u2019s diagnosis that Theresa had asthma. Nor was Theresa being treated for asthma. When questioned by Dr. Gombatz as to why she \u201cappear[ed] not to be telling me the truth?\u201d appellant answered: \u201cIt is very oppressive. I\u2019m tired of it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b576-5\">The doctor also conducted individual evaluation sessions of each of the parties, first with Theresa, and then alone. Again, appellant \u201carrived over an hour late\u201d for the appointment, and stated that, \u201cIt was not my fault.\u201d When Dr. Gombatz interviewed Theresa alone, appellant, \u201cinstead of going into the waiting room like I asked, [ ] put her ear against the door in an attempt to listen to our conversation.\u201d Shortly after the questioning began, the doctor left the office to get appellant and \u201cwas startled to see her standing by the door.\u201d Dr. Gombatz reported that appellant \u201cstarted berating\u201d him regarding his questioning of Theresa.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-6\">Dr. Gombatz reported that appellee\u2019s \u201cclinical profile was essentially within normal limits\u201d and his \u201cprojective testing is valid.\u201d In contrast, appellant\u2019s</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AV4\">clinical profile suggests borderline-narcissistic personality disorder. Her scores suggest deficits in mood stability, relationships and particularly with her own sense of identi-ty____ She tends to experience intense emotions and frequent mood swings with recurring periods of depression, anxiety and anger followed by dejection and apathy---- In addition, [appellant] is quite self-centered. She has an expectation entitlement which, if given the opportunity she will exploit people and manipulate them. She ... thinks primarily of herself.... Projective testing indicates she has deficiencies in her capacity for control and tolerance for stress.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b576-10\">Dr. Gombatz recommended that appellee \u201cis the more competent parent and Theresa\u2019s interests would be served if custody and placement were with him.\u201d His reasons included his finding that appellant acts \u201cas if Theresa is her property <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>... rather than a young girl whose development is to be fostered.\u201d He further reported: (1) \u201cThere is ... no doubt in my mind that the move to Arizona was precipitated by a desire to limit Theresa\u2019s contact with her birth father. The claim that she moved to Arizona for Theresa\u2019s medical benefit . .. has no merit;\u201d (2) appellee \u201chas a healthier relationship with Theresa than\u201d appellant; and (3) appellee \u201cwould likely be much fairer in allowing Theresa contact with [appellant] than [she] would be with him.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b577-5\">Both appellant and appellee testified at trial, as well as other witnesses called by each side. Appellee described the circumstances of appellant\u2019s move to Arizona, and how she notified him by telephone message on her day of departure that she was leaving, but failed to provide any information about her new residence until about six weeks later. After appellee learned of appellant\u2019s new residence and telephone number, he made frequent attempts to call Theresa, but appellant substantially and repeatedly interfered with his ability to speak with the child. Appellee also described how Theresa would not call him dad or other appropriate name, and addressed him without any appellation. Wade Headley, Theresa\u2019s paternal grandfather, testified that Theresa said that \u201cif I call him Daddy, I will get punished at home.\u201d Appellee\u2019s mother also described how appellant made Theresa give away toys and other gifts, including a picture painted by her, that were given to Theresa by her paternal grandparents. Appellee testified that Matthew, appellant\u2019s son from another relationship, repeatedly referred to him as \u201cDoo-doo.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b577-6\">Appellant described the early history of Theresa\u2019s life, and emphasized how appellee had originally denied his paternity of Theresa. She ascribed her move to Arizona to health reasons, explaining that she thought that Theresa had asthma, and that the drier climate would be better for Theresa.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Although <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>Theresa\u2019s medical records were introduced into evidence, appellant was unable to point to any indication in the records that Theresa suffered from asthma. She testified that Theresa did not like to visit with her father. She acknowledged giving away the gifts from Theresa\u2019s grandparents, indicating that she did not have sufficient room in her residence to store all the \u201cjunk\u201d that a child accumulated. She acknowledged that Matthew referred to appellee as \u201cDoo-Doo.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b578-5\">On April 20, 1999, the court issued an opinion from the bench that awarded custody of Theresa to appellee, and reserved visitation with appellant \u201cuntil further order of this [cjourt.\u201d This appeal was timely noted.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-6\">Additional facts will be added as necessary to our discussion of the issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b578-8\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-9\">Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b578-10\">A trial court cannot, in the exercise of its discretionary power, infringe upon constitutional rights enjoyed by the parties. <em>See Lewis v. Warden, </em>16 Md.App. 339, 342, 296 A.2d 428 (1972). Because appellant asserts that her right to travel under the United States Constitution is implicated, our standard of review in considering this issue (in Section II of this opinion) shall be an independent constitutional appraisal. <em>See Ebert v. Md. St. Bd. of Censors, </em>19 Md.App. 300, 316, 313 A.2d 536 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b578-11\">Our review of the issue of whether the trial court erred in holding that the best interests of Theresa called for an award of custody to appellee shall be governed by the abuse of discretion standard. The determination of which parent should be awarded custody rests within the sound discretion of the trial court. <em>See Robinson v. Robinson, </em>328 Md. 507, 513, 615 A.2d 1190 (1992). The court\u2019s exercise of discretion must be guided first, and foremost, by what it believes would promote the child\u2019s best interest. <em>See Kemp v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number><em>Kemp, </em>287 Md. 165, 170, 411 A.2d 1028 (1980). Additionally, the trial court\u2019s opportunity to observe the demeanor and credibility of both the parties and the witnesses is of particular importance. <em>See Petrini v. Petrini, </em>336 Md. 453, 470, 648 A.2d 1016 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b579-4\">When a trial court finds that the moving party has satisfied the burden and established a justification for a change in custody, those findings must be accorded great deference on appeal, and will only be disturbed if they are plainly arbitrary or clearly erroneous. <em>See Scott v. Dep\u2019t of Social Services, </em>76 Md.App. 357, 382-83, 545 A.2d 81, <em>cert. denied, </em>314 Md. 193, 550 A.2d 381 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b579-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-6\">Custody and Right to Travel</p>\n<p id=\"b579-7\">Appellant argues that the Supreme Court\u2019s recent decision in <em>Saenz, supra, </em>requires a change in Maryland law respecting the consideration of one parent\u2019s relocation of residence for purposes of deciding whether custody should be modified. She contends that the <em>Domingues </em>holding that relocation of residence by a parent could itself constitute the basis for a finding of a material change in circumstances is no longer valid. She asserts that the <em>Domingues </em>standard violates a person\u2019s constitutional right to travel, as recently defined in <em>Saenz. </em>Appellant insists that in the present case the court ordered a change of custody based exclusively on her relocation, thereby violating her constitutional rights. We hold, for the reasons set forth below, that the standards established by the Court of Appeals in <em>Domingues </em>do not violate the rights of a custodial parent to travel.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-8\"><em>The Domingues </em>Court was called upon to evaluate our holding in <em>Jordan v. Jordan, </em>50 Md.App. 437, 439 A.2d 26, <em>cert. denied, </em>293 Md. 332 (1982), that relocation of a parent cannot constitute the basis for a modification of custody. <em>See Domingues, </em>323 Md. at 500, 593 A.2d 1133. In so doing, the Court examined our statement in <em>Jordan </em>that \u201cRelocating as a result of remarriage, employment and the like cannot of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>itself render a parent to whom custody has been granted unfit and thereby constitute the basis for a modification of custody.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 500, 593 A.2d 1133 (quoting <em>Jordan, </em>50 Md.App. at 447, 439 A.2d 26, in turn quoting <em>Hoyt v. Boyer, </em>5 Fam. L. Rptr. 2135, 2135-36 (N.Y. Fam. Ct. Sullivan County, 1979), <em>modified on other grounds, </em>77 A.D.2d 685, 429 N.Y.S.2d 792 (1980)). The Court, overruling our holding in <em>Jordan, </em>observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b580-5\">The statement approved by the Court of Special Appeals strikes us as far too absolute in its terms. In the first place, it is not necessary that a parent be declared unfit before joint or sole custody can be changed from that parent. Moreover, changes brought about by the relocation of a parent may, in a given case, be sufficient to justify a change in custody. The result depends upon the circumstances of each case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b580-6\">The understandable desire of judges and attorneys to find bright-line rules to guide them in this most difficult area of the law does not justify the creation of hard and fast rules where they are inappropriate. Indeed, the very difficulty of the decision-making process in custody cases flows in large part from the uniqueness of each case, the extraordinarily broad spectrum of facts that may have to be considered in any given case, and the inherent difficulty of formulating bright-line rules of universal applicability in this area of the law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b580-7\"><em>Domingues, </em>323 Md. at 500-01, 593 A.2d 1133.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-8\">The Supreme Court has recognized the importance of a citizen\u2019s right to travel between states, <em>see e.g., Dunn v. Blumstein, </em>405 U.S. 330, 92 S.Ct. 995, 31 L.Ed.2d 274 (1972); <em>Shapiro v. Thompson, </em>394 U.S. 618, 89 S.Ct. 1322, 22 L.Ed.2d 600 (1969), <em>overruled in part, Edelman v. Jordan, </em>415 U.S. 651, 94 S.Ct. 1347, 39 L.Ed.2d 662 (1974). This right includes the right \u201cto migrate, resettle, find a new job, and start a new life....\u201d <em>Shapiro, </em>394 U.S. at 629, 89 S.Ct. at 1328. Although the treatment and handling of a custodial parent\u2019s decision to relocate has been addressed by many jurisdictions, <em>see </em>Carol S. Bruch and Janet M. Bowermaster, <em>The Reloca</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number><em>tion of Children and Custodial Parents: Public Policy, Past and Present, </em>30 Fam. L.Q. 245 (1996) (and cases cited therein), only a few courts have considered how the custodial parent\u2019s right to travel plays a role in a court\u2019s decision regarding custody under these circumstances. <em>See </em>Tabitha Sample and Teresa Reiger, <em>Relocation Standards and Constitutional Considerations, </em>10 J. Am. Acad. Matrim. Law. 229, 237 (1998) (\u201cSample and Reiger\u201d). Like many other states, our Court of Appeals has thoroughly addressed the issue of relocation by a custodial parent, and has clearly set forth the standard and burden of proof involved in making determinations of this issue, <em>see Domingues, supra; McCready v. McCready, </em>323 Md. 476, 593 A.2d 1128 (1991), but has not been called upon to address the constitutional right to travel in this context.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b581-5\">The right to travel is not explicitly set forth in the United States Constitution, but the Supreme Court \u201clong ago recognized that the nature of our Federal Union and our constitutional concepts of personal liberty unite to require that all citizens be free to travel throughout the length and breadth of our land uninhibited by statutes, rules, or regulations which unreasonably burden or -restrict this movement.\u201d <em>Shapiro, supra, </em>394 U.S. at 629, 89 S.Ct. at 1329.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>The Supreme Court\u2019s <em>Saenz </em>Decision</p>\n<p id=\"b582-4\">The Supreme Court revisited the right to travel in <em>Saenz, supra, </em>when the Court was called upon to interpret the constitutionality of a statute that limited the maximum welfare benefits available to state residents who had resided in a state under twelve months. Under the statute, residents would receive only the amount of benefits they would have received in the state of their prior residence for the first year that they resided in their new home state. Two California residents filed an action challenging the minimum residency requirement of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-5\">California argued that the statute was not enacted for the purpose of inhibiting migration and that \u201cit does not penalize the right to travel because new arrivals are not ineligible for benefits during their first year of residence.\u201d <em>Saenz, </em>526 U.S. at 499, 119 S.Ct. at 1525. The state further argued that it would save millions of dollars in annual welfare costs, and that this \u201cwas an appropriate exercise of budgetary authority as long as the residency requirement did not penalize the right to travel.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 497, 119 S.Ct. at 1523. California argued that the statute should be upheld if it is supported by a rational basis and the state\u2019s interest in saving millions of dollars meets that test. <em>See id. </em>at 500, 119 S.Ct. at 1525.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-6\">The Supreme Court took this opportunity to address the issue of the right to travel. According to <em>Saenz, </em>\u201c[t]he word \u2018travel\u2019 is not found in the text of the Constitution. Yet the \u2018constitutional right to travel from one State to another\u2019 is firmly embedded in our jurisprudence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 498, 119 S.Ct. at 1524 (citation omitted). \u201c[T]he right is so important that it is \u2018assertable against private interference as well as governmental action ... a virtually unconditional personal right....\u2019\u201d <em>Id. (quoting Shapiro, </em>394 U.S. at 643, 89 S.Ct. at 1336 (Stewart, J. concurring)).</p>\n<p id=\"b582-7\">The right to travel \u201cembraces at least three different components.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 500, 119 S.Ct. at 1525. The Court explained the components as: (1) the right of a citizen of one state to enter and leave another state; (2) the right of a citizen of one <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>state \u201cto be treated as a welcome visitor rather than an unfriendly alien when temporarily present\u201d in the state; and (3) \u201cfor those travelers who elect to become permanent residents, the right to be treated like other citizens of\u2019 the state. <em>Id. </em>Although the precise source of this right is obscure, <em>see Shapiro, </em>394 U.S. at 630 n. 8, 89 S.Ct. at 1329 n. 8, it originated out of concern over state discrimination against outsiders, rather than concerns over the general ability to travel interstate. <em>See Saenz, </em>526 U.S. at 497-99, 119 S.Ct. at 1524.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-5\">In contrast to appellant, the <em>Saenz </em>plaintiffs were the subject of discrimination because their rights to welfare benefits from the state were automatically limited by their move to California, regardless of their need for welfare. As the Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b583-6\">Neither the duration of respondents\u2019 California residence, nor the identity of their prior States of residence, has any relevance to their need for benefits. Nor do those factors bear any relationship to the State\u2019s interest in making an equitable allocation of the funds to be distributed among its needy citizens.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b583-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 507, 119 S.Ct. at 1528.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-8\">The component of the right to travel implicated in <em>Saenz </em>rests on the first sentence of Article IV, \u00a7 2 of the Constitution, which provides: \u201cThe Citizens of each State shall be entitled to all Privileges and Immunities of Citizens in the several States.\u201d It was the \u201cthird aspect of the right to travel \u2014 the right of the newly arrived citizen to the same privileges and immunities enjoyed by other citizens of the same State,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 502, 119 S.Ct. at 1526, that was implicated by the discriminatory welfare classification. The welfare classification based on duration of residence was held a violation of the right to travel and a penalty \u201csince the right to travel embraces the citizen\u2019s right to be treated equally in her new State of residence....\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 505, 119 S.Ct. at 1527.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-9\">In contrast, the <em>Domingues </em>Court created no discriminatory classification between those who are already residents of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>state, and those who migrate to that state for residence.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The Court simply recognized that a determination of custody is a multi-faceted decision, but that the best interests of the child must override all other competing interests, including the parent\u2019s interest in retaining custody, if a relocation would be adverse to the child. For this reason, we do not see <em>Saenz </em>as shedding new light on the subject of how the right to travel should interplay with the concerns of a court in addressing the best interests of the child in the context of a custodial parent\u2019s relocation.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-5\">The Constitutional Right to Travel Is Qualified</p>\n<p id=\"b584-6\">We think, however, that the constitutional right to travel should not be ignored in custody decisions involving the decision of one parent to relocate. Our research discloses only a few other jurisdictions in which the constitutional right to travel was asserted to defend against a change in custody based on a proposed relocation by the custodial parent. In the few cases that we have found where the constitutional right to travel was asserted, the court found that the right was implicated under such circumstances. <em>See LaChapelle v. Mitten, </em>607 N.W.2d 151, 163 (Minn.App.2000); <em>In Re Custody of D.M.G. and T.J.G., </em>287 Mont. 120, 951 P.2d 1377, 1381 (1998); <em>In Re Marriage of Cole, </em>224 Mont. 207, 729 P.2d 1276, 1280 (1986); <em>Jaramillo v. Jaramillo, </em>113 N.M. 57, 823 P.2d 299, 304 (1991); <em>In Re Marriage of Sheley, </em>78 Wash.App. 494, 895 P.2d 850 (1995); <em>overturned on other grounds, In re Marriage of Littlefield, </em>133 Wash.2d 39, 940 P.2d 1362 (1997); <em>Watt v. Watt, </em>971 P.2d 608, 615-16 (Wyo.1999). <em>See also </em>Sample and Reiger, <em>supra; </em>Paula M. Raines, <em>Joint Custody and the Right to Travel: Legal and Psychological Implications, </em>24 J. Fam. L. 625, 630-638 (1985-86) (\u201cRaines\u201d); Arthur B. LaFrance, <em>Child Custody and Relocation: A Constitutional Perspective, </em>34 U. Louisville J. Fam.

We hold this to be impossible. The right of travel enjoyed by a citizen carries with it the right of a custodial parent to have the children move with that parent. This right is not to be denied, impaired, or disparaged unless clear evidence before the court demonstrates another substantial and material change of circumstance and establishes the detrimental effect of the move upon the children. While relocation certainly may be stressful to a child, the normal anxieties of a change of residence and the inherent difficulties that the increase in geographical distance between parents imposes are not considered to be \u2018detrimental\u2019 factors.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b585-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 615-16 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b585-7\">The other cases addressing the constitutional right of travel, and its interplay with the best interests standard accord a lower priority to the constitutional right, and in doing so, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>apply standards that are consistent with the Court of Appeals decision in <em>Dominguez.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b586-5\">The intermediate appellate court of Minnesota has recognized that the constitutional right to travel is implicated in child custody disputes involving relocation, but the right must be balanced against the state\u2019s interests in protecting the best interests of the child:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b586-6\">The right to travel includes the right to \u2018live and settle down anywhere one chooses in this country without being disadvantaged because of that choice.\u2019 The nature of the disadvantage or hardship involved is important to the level of review a restriction on the right to travel receives.

In addressing the interplay between the constitutional right to travel and the competing concerns of the state \u2014 in the best interests of the child, and the non-custodial parent \u2014 in maintaining close association and frequent contact with the child, the Supreme Court of New Mexico said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b587-5\">[T]he protection afforded the right to travel in the child-custody context has been explicitly recognized by ... this Court....

In such a proceeding neither parent will have the burden to show that relocation of the child with the removing parent will be in or contrary to the child\u2019s best interests. Each party will have the burden to persuade the court that the new custody arrangement or parenting plan proposed by him or her should be adopted by the court, but that party\u2019s failure to carry this burden will only mean that the court remains free to adopt the arrangement or plan that it determines best promotes the child\u2019s interests.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b589-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 309.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-6\">After review of the Supreme Court decisions in <em>Saenz </em>and <em>Shapiro, </em>the out of state cases addressing the issue, as well as commentary on the issue,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> we conclude that the standard set forth in <em>Domingues </em>for deciding custody disputes involving a parental relocation does not interfere with a custodial parent\u2019s right to travel. The Supreme Court has given no indication that the constitutional right to travel should be paramount over the state\u2019s interest in preserving the best interests of the children. Indeed, the state\u2019s duty to protect the interests of minor children has been recognized by the Supreme Court as \u201cduty of the highest order.\u201d <em>Palmore v. Sidoti, </em>466 U.S. 429, 433, 104 S.Ct. 1879, 1882, 80 L.Ed.2d 421 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b590-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number>We consider the reasoning of the Supreme Court of New Mexico in <em>Jaramillo </em>to be the most cogent analysis of the appropriate interplay between the constitutional right and the family law concerns, because it articulates why a presumption favoring either the relocating custodial parent or the noncustodial parent would upset the balance that is needed to arrive at a fair determination of the child\u2019s best interests. There is no constitutional infirmity in giving equal status, in determining the child\u2019s best interests, to (1) the custodial parent\u2019s right to travel, and the benefit to be given the child from remaining with the custodial parent; and (2) the benefit from the non-custodial parent\u2019s exercise of his right to maintain close association and frequent contact with the child.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-5\">Treatment of the Right to Travel Under <em>Domingues</em></p>\n<p id=\"b590-6\">Although the Court of Appeals in <em>Domingues </em>was not presented with an argument based on the constitutional right to travel, and did not rule on the constitutional issue, it did mention the \u201cright to travel\u201d in its opinion, and made reference to commentaries<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> discussing the right. In describing the law in other jurisdictions, the Court of Appeals said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b590-7\">In some states the courts jealously protect the right of travel, and place a heavy burden upon the parent who would challenge the relocation. In other states, the burden is placed upon the parent contemplating relocation to show that it would be in the best interest of the child. The legislatures of some states have enacted \u2018anti-removal\u2019 statutes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b590-8\"><em>Domingues, </em>323 Md. at 501, 593 A.2d 1133 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b590-9\">Further, its reasoning regarding the best way, for non-constitutional reasons, to determine the best interests of the child when proposed relocation is involved, is based on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"609\">*609</page-number>fundamental concept, also evident in the <em>Jaramillo </em>constitutional analysis, that there are no \u201cabsolutes\u201d other than the best interests of the child. <em>See Domingues, </em>323 Md. at 501, 593 A.2d 1133; <em>Jaramillo, </em>823 P.2d at 309 n. 10 (\u201cThe respective interests of the parents are relevant ... and should be considered by the court; but the interests of the child take precedence over any conflicting interest of either parent.\u201d). The Court of Appeals explained how the competing interests of the parents might be viewed differently, depending on the circumstances presented:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b591-5\">The view that a court takes toward relocation may reflect an underlying philosophy of whether the interest of the child is best served by the certainty and stability of a primary caretaker, or by ensuring significant day-to-day contact with both parents. Certainly, the relationship that exists between the parents and the child before relocation is of critical importance. If one parent has become the primary caretaker, and the other parent has become an occasional or infrequent visitor, evidencing little interest in day-to-day contact with the child, the adverse effects of a move by the custodial parent will be diminished. On the other hand, where both parents are interested, and are actively involved with the life of the child on a continuing basis, a move of any substantial distance may upset a very desirable environment, and may not be in the best interest of the child.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b591-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 501-02, 593 A.2d 1133.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-7\">We conclude that the approach taken by the Court of Appeals in <em>Domingues </em>sufficiently protects the constitutional right to travel because it requires consideration of that right, and gives the parent choosing to exercise that right an equal footing as the other parent with respect to the burden to show the best interests of the children. Accordingly, we see no reason, based on <em>Saenz, supra, </em>or the right to travel, as recognized in other Supreme Court decisions, to modify the standards for considering relocation cases from that set forth in <em>Domingues.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b592-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"610\">*610</page-number>III.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-5\">Material Change in Circumstances</p>\n<p id=\"b592-6\">Appellant argues that under the circumstances of this case, her relocation to Arizona did not warrant a material change in circumstances sufficient to order a change in custody, and that the trial court based its finding of change solely on her relocation. She also asserts that she \u201cseems to be extraordinarily adept at rubbing people ... the wrong way\u201d and that the judge\u2019s dislike for her in conjunction with admiration for appellee amounts to \u00e1 \u201cpopularity contest\u201d and was the reason for the custody transfer. We disagree. The record makes clear that, in deciding to transfer custody, the trial court carefully considered all the evidence before it with a view towards determining the best interests of the child. It considered the relocation to Arizona, and the effect the move would have on Theresa. Its decision that the change in circumstances, when considered in light of Theresa\u2019s best interests, warranted a change in custody, was well supported by the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-7\">The threshold issue is the existence of a material change. A change of custody resolution is generally \u201ca chronological two-step process.\u201d <em>Wagner v. Wagner, </em>109 Md.App. 1, 28, 674 A.2d 1, <em>cert. denied, </em>343 Md. 334, 681 A.2d 69 (1996). Initially, unless a material change of circumstances is found to exist, the court\u2019s inquiry must cease. <em>See id. </em>If a material change is found to exist, \u201cthen the court, in resolving the custody issue, considers the best interest of the child as if it were an original custody proceeding.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b592-8\">In determining whether the change was material we look to whether the changes related to the welfare of the child. <em>See McCready, supra, </em>323 Md. at 481, 593 A.2d 1128. The factors to be considered-in determining custody of a child include,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b592-9\">but [are] not limited to: (1) fitness of the parents; (2) character and reputation of the parties; (3) desire of the natural parents and agreements between the parties; (4) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"611\">*611</page-number>potentiality of maintaining natural family relations; (5) preference of the child; (6) material opportunities affecting the future life of the child; (7) age, health and sex of the child; (8) residences of parents and opportunity for visitation; (9) length of separation from the natural parents; and (10) prior voluntary abandonment or surrender.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b593-5\"><em>Montgomery County v. Sanders, </em>38 Md.App. 406, 420, 381 A.2d 1154 (1977) (citations omitted). As we discussed in Section II, changes \u201cbrought about by the relocation of a parent may, in a given case, be sufficient to justify a change in custody.\u201d <em>Domingues, </em>323 Md. at 500, 593 A.2d 1133; <em>see also Goldmeier v. Lepselter, </em>89 Md.App. 301, 309, 598 A.2d 482 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b593-6\">The record contains considerable evidence that appellant actively sought to interfere with or prevent appellee from having a relationship with Theresa, and that she had no appreciation for the need of her daughter to have a relationship with her father. Further, Dr. Gombatz\u2019s report contained significant information regarding appellant\u2019s personality that negatively influenced her ability to serve as the custodial parent. The trial court considered Dr. Gombatz\u2019s report, and observed that appellant\u2019s</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AD_\">conduct is totally consistent with the diagnosis that Dr. Gombatz had given me so that I used Dr. Gombatz\u2019[s] report not as a primary tool in making a decision in this case but as a back up tool, as a test, and the diagnosis and observations made by Dr. Gombatz are consistent with and confirm the observations that I made in this courtroom. The diagnosis of borderline personality disorder ... produces a personality that is extremely difficult to work with.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b593-7\">[Appellant] does what she perceives to be right and fair and just and simply doesn\u2019t consider what anyone else wants.... [S]he [acts] with what is consistent with her own interests and the testimony that I heard bears that out and Dr. Gombatz simply confirms it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b593-8\">The trial court determined that a change in circumstances had occurred, and that it was material. The court found that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b594-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"612\">*612</page-number>(1) appellant moved to Arizona with the intent to \u201cseparate the child from the father\u201d to place \u201cdistance between the child and the father\u201d and \u201cto avoid contact between father and child;\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Azzq\">(2) there was \u201cno evidence that there is a health issue on the part of either the child or [appellant] that justified the move---- [T]he child does not have asthma;\u201d (3) appellant was an \u201cunreliable\u201d witness with \u201ctotally inappropriate\u201d demeanor on the witness stand on \u201cmany\u201d occasions, and \u201cis not a reliable fact giver;\u201d (4) appellant \u201cleft the state of Maryland without giving prior notice\u201d to appellee; (5) appellant \u201cdoes discourage the child from calling [appellee] \u2018Dad\u2019 and from addressing the grandparents in appropriate terms as \u2018grandmother\u2019 or \u2018granddad\u2019 \u201d; (6) \u201cMatthew does refer to [appellee] in derogatory terms in front of Teresa,\u201d and Matthew\u2019s low opinion of appellee is \u201cbased exclusively upon the information that [appellant] has provided to these children;\u201d and (7) appellant \u201cis avoiding telephone calls\u201d from appellee to Theresa, and that she \u201cis unwilling to communicate with [appellee] in any reasonable way.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b594-8\">The court considered highly significant its finding that appellant \u201cgaye no consideration to the impact of her conduct on either the child or herself.\u201d It observed that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AMo\">\u201c[t]here was no thought given to the consequences of removing the child from the State of Maryland without resolving the visitation issue..... There has been no consideration on [appellant\u2019s] part from what the impact of blocking access of this child to this father would be. And it\u2019s simply because she doesn\u2019t like [appellee] and [she] is very angry at [appel-lee] over his failure to follow through to get married____ And I find that [appellant] <em>is simply unable to separate her own needs from the needs of the child.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b594-10\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b594-11\">We believe the evidence before the trial court supported its findings that appellant did not consider Theresa\u2019s best interests prior to moving the child out of the State of Maryland, and that she is incapable of separating her own interests from the best interests of her child. The relocation from Maryland <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"613\">*613</page-number>is a modification that will particularly effect Theresa\u2019s best interests because of appellant\u2019s unwillingness to cooperate to foster a good relation between Theresa and her father. If Theresa were to live in a distant state with appellant, it would be easier for appellant to undermine Theresa\u2019s relationship with her father. Similarly, the long distance would make it harder for appellee to overcome the obstacles created by appellant. The potential for maintaining natural family relations is one factor to be considered in determining custody of a child. <em>See Montgomery County, </em>38 Md.App. at 420, 381 A.2d 1154. As discussed in Section II, the relocation of appellant to another state, can, under Maryland law, constitute the material change in circumstances necessary to trigger the best interests analysis. <em>See Domingues, </em>323 Md. at 500-03, 593 A.2d 1133. This case presents the proto-type of an instance when a relocation meets the <em>Domingues </em>and constitutional standards.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-5\">The trial court had the opportunity to observe the witnesses, and view all of the evidence. We cannot say that the trial court abused its discretion in concluding that there had been a material change in circumstances, and the best interests of Theresa warranted a modification of appellant\u2019s parental rights. Based on its factual findings, the court\u2019s award was not clearly erroneous. <em>See Lemley v. Lemley, </em>109 Md.App. 620, 627-628, 675 A.2d 596 (1996) (\u201cA chancellor\u2019s decision founded upon sound legal principles and based upon factual findings that are not clearly erroneous will not be disturbed in the absence of a showing of a clear abuse of discretion.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b595-6\">JUDGMENT AFFIRMED.

In <em>Schaefer we </em>reviewed a trial court order awarding custody of a minor child to one parent for a period of years, but changing custody to the father when the child completed fifth grade. The order also required that the parents live within forty-five miles of each other. The mother, who was awarded custody, appealed from the order, contesting, <em>inter alia, </em>the requirement that she live within forty-five miles of the father. She asserted several constitutional rights, including the right to travel, as well as arguing that the trial court had no jurisdiction to grant such request. We struck down the forty-five mile limitation, holding that \u201cthe best interest of the child can be determined better at the time a relocation is proposed than in an attempt to look into the future and to say now that the best interest of the child requires a present determination that a separation of the parents by more than forty-five miles would have an adverse effect upon the child.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 307, 722 A.2d 73.
