The crossing was within the limits of an Indian reservation. <em>Held, </em>(I) (following <em>O\u2019Meara </em>v. <em>Commissioners of Allegany, </em>3 N. Y. Sup. 236), that the State had power to construct a highway across an Indian reservation ; (2) that the railway company was bound to <em>keep </em>the crossings o.f such highway in repair and was liable for an injury caused by neglect to do so, and (3) that a presumption of negligence arose from the defect and the fact that an injury was caused thereby.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b30-10\">Appeal by defendant from a judgment, in favor of plaintiff, of the Cattaraugus county court entered upon the verdict of a jury, and from an order denying a new trial. The action was brought in a justice\u2019s court by Alonzo France to recover damages for an in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>jury sustained by the plaintiff\u2019s horse at a highway crossing over defendant\u2019s railway. The injury was in consequence of a defect in the planking between the rails, causing the horse to stumble. The crossing was upon a highway passing through the Cattaraugus Indian reservation. The justice gave judgment for plaintiff for $85, and an appeal was taken by defendant to the county court, and a new trial had before a jury which resulted in a verdict in favor of plaintiff for $80.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b31-5\"><em>John Ganson, </em>for appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AhJ\">Defendant was not chargeable with negligence, unless it appeared that it had notice of the defect causing the injury.

Plaintiff was crossing the track where it intersects a highway in Salamanca, on the Cattaraugus Indian reservation.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-10\">The power of the' State to construct highways on Indian reservations is virtually affirmed in <em>O\u2019Meara </em>v. <em>Commissioners of Allegany, 3 </em>N. Y. Sup. 236. The right of a railroad company to lay its tracks across a highway carries with it the obligation to keep them in repair, and if an injury happens by reason of its neglect of that duty it is liable. A presumption of negligence arises from the existence of a d\u00e9fect, and the fact that an injury was caused thereby. <em>Wooster </em>v. <em>Forty-second St., etc., R. R. Co., </em>50 N.
