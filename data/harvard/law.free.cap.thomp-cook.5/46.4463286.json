M. Miner, as receiver of the Jamestown Farmers\u2019 Insurance Company, against Charles K. Judson, upon a premium note given by defendant to said company, to recover the amounts assessed upon such note for losses which had accrued on policies issued by said company, which was a mutual insurance company, incorporated under chapter 308 of the Laws of 1849.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b64-12\">In August, 1853, said company issued to defendant a policy insur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>ing certain personal property owned by Mm, and defendant executed a premium note, whereby he promised to pay $165 \u201c in such portions and at such time or times as the directors of said company may, agreeably to their charter and by-laws, require.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b65-5\">By the third section of the charter of the company it was provided that \u201callpersons who shall insure with the said company, and also their heirs, executors, administrators and assigns, continuing to be insured in said company, as hereinafter provided, shall thereby become and continue members thereof during the period they shall remain insured by said company and no longer.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b65-6\">And by the thirteenth section it was provided that \u201cwhen any property insured by this company shall be alienated, by sale or otherwise, the policy shall thereupon be void and be surrendered to said company to be canceled; and, upon such surrender, the assured shall be entitled to receive his deposit note upon the payment of his proportion of the losses and expenses that have occurred prior to such surrender, but the grantee or alienee having the policy assigned to him may-have the same ratified and confirmed to him, for his own use and benefit, on giving proper security to the satisfaction of the directors for such portion of the deposit or premium note as shall remain unpaid, and. by such ratification and confirmation the party causing such security to bez given, shall be entitled to all the privileges and be subject to all the liabilities to wMch the original party, to whom the policy was given, was entitled and was subjected under this charter.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b65-7\">In December, 1853, defendant sold the insured property to one Morris, taMng back a chattel mortgage for the whole purchase-money. At the time of the sale the company, by its secretary, indorsed upon the policy the following consent:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b65-8\">\u201c The Jamestown Farmers\u2019 Insurance Company hereby consent that the interest of 0. K. Judson, in the within policy, be assigned to B. F. Morris. We also consent 0. K.

In 1864 the receiver was ordered by the court, for the purpose of paying losses due on polici\u00e9s issued by the company, all of which had accrued subsequent to the sale by defendant, to make an assessment on the premium notes given to the company. Under this order he assessed upon defendant\u2019s note, which had not been given up, $96.25. This assessment was confirmed by the court, and the receiver ordered to collect the same.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b66-6\">The case has been, on a former appeal, argued at the general term, when most of the questions at issue were decided, and is reported in 2 Dans. 300. Such further facts as are material appear in the opinion.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b66-7\"><em>C. D.

It had not then appeared that, upon such sale of the subject insured, the defendant took back a chattel mortgage to secure payment of the price. Upon the last trial that fact was proved, and the referee gave such effect to it as again to render judgment against the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-10\">We think the referee erred. The legal effect of the sale by the defendant was to vest the title in the purchaser. A complete alienation was thus made. The chattel mortgage given to the defendant by the purchaser operated as a transfer of the title subject to be defeated on payment of the sum it was given to secure. The title of the defendant under the mortgage would become absolute only upon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>default in the performance of the condition. <em>Parshall </em>v. <em>Eggert, </em>54 N. Y. 18. The mortgagor held the equitable title to the property, and that wohld continue in him until barred by a sale, by judicial decree or by lapse of time. <em>Atkins </em>v. <em>Hosley, </em>3 N. Y. Sup. 326; <em>Porter </em>v. <em>Parmley, </em>52 N. Y. 188, and authorities cited. The principle asserted in the case of <em>Savage </em>v. <em>Howard Ins. Co., </em>52 N. Y. 502, is decisive of the effect of the transaction referred to, and requires us to reverse the judgment appealed from, and grant a new trial, with costs to abide the event. \u2022</p>\n<p id=\"b67-5\">\n<em>Judgment reversed and new trial ordered.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
