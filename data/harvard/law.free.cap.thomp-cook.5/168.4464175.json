The complaint alleged that the goods were the property of plaintiff. This was not denied by the answer. The evidence in behalf of plaintiff at the trial showed that the goods were the property of the firm of Dickinson &amp; Co., composed of plaintiff and one Frederick Dunscomb. The court thereupon, upon motion of defendant, dismissed the complaint. Such other facts as are material appear in the opinion.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b187-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number><em>C.

It appeared on the trial that the plaintiff had a partner in the business. The nonjoinder of such partner was not in any manner disclosed by either the complaint or answer. The rule seems to be well settled that when the defense of nonjoinder of parties plaintiff exists, and is not disclosed by the complaint, it must be brought forward in the answer. <em>Bank of Havana </em>v. <em>Magee, </em>20 N. Y. 602; opinion of Comstock, J.; <em>Zabriskie </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>13 N. Y. 322; Code, \u00a7\u00a7 147, 148. The judge at the trial dismissed the complaint upon the ground of the nonjoinder of the partner. This was erroneous whether the plaintiff would have been able to maintain the action in his sole name or not, if all the facts had been pleaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-7\">This is a motion for'a new trial, the exception having been sent to the general term in the first instance.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-8\">A new trial is ordered, costs to abide the event.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-9\">\n<em>Hew trial ordered.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
