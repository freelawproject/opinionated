In the deed conveying these lands was this: \u201cThe said Partridge has the right to use the stream called Otter creek, that runs through the tannery lot, for the purpose of floating logs, timber, lumber, and the products (through said lot), and to improve and deepen said stream; and also the right to make a canal (through said lot), and roads, and other modes of transportation, and to keep and maintain them, and have the full use of them,\u201d etc.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b644-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number>The tannery lot was between the lands purchased by plaintiff and a tract also owned by plaintiff, on which there was a saw-mill.

The plaintiff founds his claim upon a s\u00fapposed grant from certain parties who formerly owned the land on, both sides of the stream. The grant, however, upon which the plaintiff bases his claim, does not purport to convey any such exclusive right or any right inconsistent with the rights of other owners of the lands bounding on the creek. The . questions arising upon the construction of the plaintiff\u2019s grant, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"627\">*627</page-number>upon another paper, which he claimed to be a license, we think, however, have ceased to be of any importance, as the legislature, by an act passed in April, 1872, have declared the said Otter creek and its tributaries in the counties of Lewis and Herkimer to be a public highway for the purpose of floating logs and lumber thereon, and made numerous and careful provisions for the regulation of the use of the stream, as such public highway. That this act, if valid, vests the rights specified in the public, and supersedes any exclusive right in any one party, if any such had before existed, cannot be denied. There can be no doubt that the legislature has the power to appropriate, by force of its own enactment, any flowing stream to the use of the public, as a highway, provided suitable provisions are contained in the act, to secure to private parties a just compensation for the individual rights, which by the appropriation may have been divested, infringed upon, or impaired. The only objection suggested to the act in question is, that the only provision for compensation is for the payment of damages to riparian owners. And the plaintiff claims rights, under his grant, more extensive than those that result to him from his riparian ownership of such portion of the lands owned by him, as border upon the creek. But the parties under whose grant he claims had no rights to the stream, other than such as vested in them under the rules of law as riparian owners. The right to the use of flowing water is <em>\u201cpublici juris,\u201d </em>and common to all riparian proprietors. It is a right to the flow and enjoyment of the water, subject to a similar right in all the proprietors. Angel\u00ed on Water-courses, \u00a7 95. The grantors of the plaintiff, whatever they may have assumed to do, could not grant to him any rights except those limited ones which vested in them as riparian owners, because they had no more extensive rights themselves. \"He is, therefore, in any point of view, the mere representative and grantee of the riparian owners, and as such we think is embraced within the description of \u201c riparian owners on said creek,\u201d which is contained in the act, and is to be liberally construed for the purpose of determining to whom the legislature designed compensation should be made. As to all rights to which the plaintiff, at the time of the passage of the act of 1872, was lawfully entitled, beyond those which accrued to himself as a riparian owner, if any, we think he was entitled to receive a just compensation, under the act, as the lawful representative in the premises of his grantors.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"628\">*628</page-number>The complaint of the plaintiff, that the commissioners appointed under the act did not award him sufficient compensation, is not in-any manner before us for consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-5\">The judgment is affirmed, with the costs of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
