The plaintiffs seek a preliminary and permanent injunction against the election of legislators, both Senators and Representatives, from these three counties on a county-at-large basis, because they claim that multi-member districting operates to minimize and cancel out the voting strength of Negroes residing in the predominantly Negro ghettos in said counties to the extent that they are deprived of equal protection of the laws under the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States and also in violation of the Fifteenth Amendment. The complaint further seeks a declaration of the unconstitutionality of Section 200 of the Constitution of Alabama requiring that no county be divided to create a legislative district; of the statute providing for the multi-member senatorial districts of the three counties;<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and of the decree of this Court providing for the multi-mem<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>ber house of representatives districts, and approving and adopting the multimember senatorial districts of the three counties.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b164-4\">All of the plaintiffs to the present action and the classes which they represent are within the broader class bound by the opinion and decree in Sims v. Baggett, n. 2, <em>supra. </em>That case undertook to completely reapportion the Alabama Legislature, both the House of Representatives and the Senate, effective with the term of office of the new legislative seats therein created to commence on the day after the General Election to be held in November 1966 and to remain in effect until after the next decennial census.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b164-5\">At two places in the opinion it requires that \u201crepresentation in each House be divided according to county lines and that no county be subdivided to create a legislative district.\u201d (247 F.Supp. 103, repeated at 105.) Thus the opinion forbids the kind of redistricting sought by the plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-6\">Insofar as the complaint attacks the reapportionment or redistricting for the period covered by the opinion and decree of this Court, the complaint must be treated as an independent action seeking relief from a judgment under Rule 60(b), Fed.R.Civ.P. So treated, we think that the preliminary injunction should be denied for several reasons. The relief is not sought on the basis of newly discovered evidence or changed conditions since the date of the decree. While there have been further important developments in the applicable law,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> basically the plaintiffs are undertaking to present the question which the Court held was not presented by the record in Fortson v. Dorsey, 1965, 379 U.S. 433, 439, 85 S.Ct. 498, 501, 13 L.Ed.2d 401:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-12\">\u201cIt might well be that, designedly or otherwise, a multi-member constituency apportionment scheme, under the circumstances of a particular case, would operate to minimize or cancel out the voting strength of racial or political elements of the voting population. When this is demonstrated it will be time enough to consider whether the system still passes constitutional muster. This question, however, is not presented by the record before us.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ANS\">As to other aspects of the legislative reapportionment plan for the House of Representatives, that question was not only presented but was sustained in Sims v. Baggett.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b165-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>The present plaintiffs had an opportunity in Sims v. Baggett to raise the questions now presented but failed to do so. There was no objection at that time to this Court\u2019s holding \u201cthat no county be subdivided to create a legislative district\u201d (247 F.Supp. 103, repeated at 105). The complaint in the present action was filed on January 13, 1970, more than four years after the judgment was entered in Sims v. Baggett, <em>swpra, </em>and at such time that a three-judge district court could not be convened for the hearing of the application for preliminary injunction until February 25, 1970, only three days before the expiration of the date for filing notice of candidacy for nomination to office by the Democratic Party of Alabama, the predominant political party in said State. In our opinion the complaint was not filed \u201cwithin a reasonable time\u201d within the meaning of Rule 60(b), Fed.R.Civ.P.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-5\">The plaintiffs urge that by the use of the words \u201cexcept by order of this Court\u201d in the judgment or decree of Sims v. Baggett, <em>supra, </em>this Court reserved jurisdiction to change the judgment or decree. Assuming that we have such a discretion, we do not think that it should be exercised. Clearly, this Court should not itself subdivide a county for legislative representation during the period of time that it has enjoined the Legislature from so doing, because any such subdivision is, of course, primarily a legislative function.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-6\">Nor do we think that a proper case has been made for this Court to compel legislative action. The Supreme Court has recognized that \u201climitations on the frequency of reapportionment are justified by the need for stability and continuity in the organization of the legislative system.\u201d Reynolds v. Sims, 1964, 377 U.S. 533, 583, 84 S.Ct. 1362, 1393, 12 L.Ed.2d 506. The Supreme Court has further held that decennial reapportionment \u201cwould clearly meet the minimal requirements for maintaining a reasonably current scheme of legislative representation.\u201d <em>Id., 377 </em>U.S. at 583, 584, 84 S.Ct. at 1393. The present reapportionment has remained in effect for less than half of the minimal ten-year period. After the completion of the 1970 census the Legislature can be expected with reasonable dispatch to reapportion both the House and the Senate in such a manner as will not deprive any voter of the equal protection of the laws as guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment. The earlier action here sought would necessarily be hasty and incomplete, as well as being based upon inadequate and uncertain factual evidence. Since the Legislature has complied with this Court\u2019s decree in Sims v. Baggett, <em>supra, </em>and has been enjoined by this Court from making any changes in the reapportionment therein ordered, we think it would be unreasonable and unwise to require any legislative reapportionment prior to the time fixed in that decree, that is, prior to the first legislative session following the completion of the 1970 decennial census. In our opinion this Court should deny the plaintiffs\u2019 motion for preliminary injunction.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-8\">However, we should also deny the defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss the complaint, retain jurisdiction of the complaint, and postpone a hearing on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>the merits, if any hearing should be necessary, until the Alabama Legislature has reapportioned the two Houses of the Legislature or has unreasonably failed in its duty so to do.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-4\">It would, of course, be premature for this Court to pass upon the factual or legal merits of the plaintiffs\u2019 complaint. In our opinion, however, the evidence offered in support of the plaintiffs\u2019 claims, if such evidence is substantiated by the 1970 decennial census and by the further evidence then available, makes out a strong case for the consideration of the Legislature of Alabama. Indeed, in all probability, this Court would grant some relief to the plaintiffs at this time but for the existence of the reasons heretofore stated for denial of the plaintiffs\u2019 motion for preliminary injunction.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-5\">If the multi-member election of legislators to the Alabama Legislature from any county on a county-at-large basis operates to minimize or dilute the voting strength of Negroes in said county to the extent that they are deprived of equal protection of the laws under the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States, then, of course, Section 200 of the Constitution of Alabama would in no way prevent the Legislature of Alabama from dividing the county into such separate legislative districts as might be needed to effect compliance with the Constitution of the United States. That is true because of the principle stated in Reynolds v. Sims, 1964, 377 U.S. 533, 584, 84 S.Ct. 1362, 1393, 12 L.Ed.2d 506, that \u201cwhen there is an unavoidable conflict between the Federal and a State Constitution, the Supremacy Clause of course controls.\u201d Similarly, nothing said in this Court\u2019s opinion in Sims v. Baggett, supra, could prevent a county from being subdivided into separate legislative districts in order to effect compliance with the Constitution of the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-6\">It would be premature for this Court to rule upon the plaintiffs\u2019 claims until after the 1970 decennial census and until after appropriate action by the Legislature of Alabama. If further action by this Court then appears appropriate, more exact factual information will be available and the legal and constitutional issues will-be more sharply defined.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-8\">ORDER</p>\n<p id=\"b166-9\">It is ordered and adjudged by this Court:</p>\n<p id=\"b166-10\">1. That the plaintiffs\u2019 motion for preliminary injunction be and the same is hereby denied;</p>\n<p id=\"b166-11\">2. That the defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss the complaint be and the same is hereby denied;</p>\n<p id=\"b166-12\">3.
