On this road quantities of grain are carried from the West to Chicago and other eastern towns. Arriving at Dubuque, the grain, bound eastward, or as it was called \u201c <em>through </em>grain,\u201d was formerly taken from the railcars, put on a ferry-boat, carried thus across the Mississippi to Dunlieth (a town in Illinois directly opposite Dubuque), and there put upon ears of the Illinois Central Railroad and sent forward, east. Dubuque was thus a point for transshipment. In this state of things the Sioux City and Dubuque Railroad made a contract with Richmond and another, owners of an elevator at Dubuque, beside the road and near the river, that they, the owners of this elevator, should have the handling of all the \u201cthrough grain;\u201d and that the railroad company would pay them a certain price per bushel for receiving and discharging it, and would pay also for storage of it when exceeding ten days.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b16-7\">With this contract in force Congress in 1866 passed two acts, one of June 15th,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> entitled \u201cAn act to facilitate commercial, postal, and- military communications among the several States,\u201d which enacted:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b16-8\">\u201c That every railroad company in the United States, &amp;c., be, and is hereby, authorized to carry upon and over its road, boats, bridges, and ferries, all passengers, troops, government supplies, freight, and property on their way from any State to another State, and to receive compensation therefor, <em>and to connect with roads of other States so as to form continuous lines for the transportation of the same to the place of destination.\u201d</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b16-9\">The other, an act'of July 25th,<footnotemark>\u2020</footnotemark> entitled \u201cAn act to authorize the construction of certain bridges, and establish them as post roads.\u201d This act provided for the construction of certain bridges across the Mississippi River, including one at Dubuque, and declared that they shall be</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b17-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>\u201c For the more perfect connection of any railroads that are or shall be constructed to the said river at or opposite said points, and that, when constructed, all trains of ail roads terminating at said river, at or opposite said point, shall bo allowed to cross said bridge,\u201d &amp;c.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b17-5\">In pursuance of this second act a bridge was built over the river; and in virtue of the first one the two roads were connected by the Dubuque bridge, so as to form a continuous line of roads, and put under one management and control, that of the Illinois Central Railroad, which agreed to assume the contract about the elevator.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b17-6\">Neither road having, however, any further occasion to trausfer at Dubuque anything passing over the road, the elevator was no longer used. The grain passed continuously on. Thereupon, Richmond, and the other owners of the elevator, brought suit against the companies, alleging that they, the companies, were</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b17-7\">\u201c Daily receiving through grain as aforesaid, and passing the same through Dubuque, without permitting the plaintiffs to have the handling of the same at their elevator as aforesaid, and without paying the plaintiffs therefor.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b17-8\">The petition asked for damages, and prayed for an injunction to restrain the companies from delivering grain otherwise than through their elevator.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b17-9\">The defendants denied every allegation in the petition,</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AP\">and averred that the plaintiffs had been paid in full for all of the grain which they were entitled to handle under and by virtue of the said contract.. They did not, however, plead specially the Constitution of the United States, nor the acts of Congress hereinbefore named, as a defence to the demand.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b17-11\">The case was heard in the Supreme Court of Iowa, where</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b17-12\"><em>\u25a0 a </em>final decree was rendered, giving the plaiutifts in the case $73,186 damages, and concluding thus :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b17-13\">\u201cAnd it is further ordered, adjudged, and decreed that the claim of the said defendants, that the Constitution of the United States, and certain acts of the Congress of the United States, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>one entitled, &amp;c., approved July 25th, 1866, and another entitled, &amp;e., and approved June 15th, 1866, renders void and of no force and effect the covenants sued on in this action by the said plaintiffs in the contract and supplemental contract, which are the subjects of this action, be and the same is hei\u2019eby denied, and it is adjudged that the said Constitution and the said acts of Congress do not in any manner affect the validity or force and effect of cither or any of said covenants, or of either of said contracts.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b18-6\">From this decree it was that the present writ was taken, under the assumption, as already stated, that the case came within the third clause of the 25th section of the Judiciary Act.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b18-7\">The motion to dismiss was made on the ground that \u201c the record did not show a slate of facts that made any act of Congress apply to the case.\u201d</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b18-8\">\n<em>Mr. Platt Smith, in support of the motion:</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b18-9\">Although the acts authorize the connection of the tracks so as to form continuous lines of transportation to the place of destination; and though the tracks are connected and the lines formed, the acts do not say that the grain once loaded and on the line shall in no case change cars or break bulk short of the ultimate destination.</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b18-10\">The contract provides that the owners of the elevator shall have the handling of all through grain, and shall have one cent per bushel for the service. The Supreme Court of Iowa says that they will not compel the railroad company to perform this contract specifically, but that they will give damages in lieu if the grain goes on the continuous line without breaking bulk, and the plaintiffs get judgment for the breach of contract. These acts do not in terms nor can they in spirit be stretched to reach the contracts.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b18-11\">\n<em>Mr. J. E. Wilson, contra:</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b18-12\">The final decree rendered by the Supreme Court of Iowa shows:</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b18-13\">1. That a question was presented to that court, consid<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>ered, and decided, involving the commercial power of Congress, and the construction of two acts of that department of the government, and the exemption set up by the defendants from liability to discharge the covenants, contained in the contracts sued on, because of the exercise of the said power in the passage of the acts named.</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b19-5\">2. That the said court did construe the provisions of the Constitution conferring the said power, and did construe the said acts of Congress, and thereupon did adjudge \u201cthat said Constitution and said acts of Congress do not in any manner affect the validity or force and effect of either or any of said covenants, or either of said contracts.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b19-6\">3. That the several contracts, and the several covenants therein contained, were considered in their relations to the Constitution, and said several acts of Congress, and severally held to be valid and of force and effect, because of the construction given to'the Constitution and acts by the said court; thereby denying the right of the defendants to carry grain passing from one State to another State without delivering the same to the plaintiffs, and denying the exemption claimed from the covenant of said contract to deliver said grain, and pay one cent a bushel therefor.</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b19-7\">Certainly a Federal question is thus presented under the third clause of the 25th section.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b16-10\"> 14 Stat. at Large, 66.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-2\" label=\"\u2020\">\n<p id=\"b16-11\"> Ib. 244.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b19-8\">The CHIEF JUSTICE</author>\n<p id=\"AU\">delivered the opinion of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b19-9\">The defendants in error move to dismiss the writ of error on the ground that the \u201c record does not show a state of facts, that makes any act of Congress apply to the case.\u201d The record does show, however, that the present plaintiffs in error claimed in the State court, that contracts made with the defendants in error had been rendered void and-of no force and effect by provisions of the Constitution of the United States, and of certain acts of Congress, approved June 15th, 1866, and July 25th, 1866, and also that the decision of the Supreme Court of Iowa, denied this claim.
