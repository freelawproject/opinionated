The bonds were not paid at maturity, and Johnson filed a petition in equity in the Superior Court of New London County, Connecticut, praying that the mortgage be foreclosed, and sale ordered of the stock. In that suit Huntington and Nichols were summoned, and a decree was given against them <em>as trustees, </em>as well as against the railroad company as mortgagors. From that decree the company alone appealed to the Supreme Court of the State. The decree below having been affirmed in that court, the railroad company alone brought the case here by writ of error.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b20-9\">Johnson now moved to dismiss the writ on the ground that Huntington and Nichols were not joined with the railroad company'as plaintiffs.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b20-10\">\n<em>Mr. George Pratt, in support of the motion:</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b20-11\">A writ of error must be brought in the names of all the parties against whom the judgment to be reviewed is given.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> This is a substantial defect in the appeal, and can be taken advantage of at any time before judgment.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b20-12\">\n<em>Mr. J.
