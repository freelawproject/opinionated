Notwithstanding this the marshal advertised the same land for sale under other executions. Hereupon one Burrows, alleging that <em>he </em>had purchased and paid for the land, and had tendered the marshal a proper draft of a deed to him, obtained a rule on the marshal to show cause why he should not make such a deed, and why another sale under the other executions should not be stayed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b695-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"683\">*683</page-number>The marshal set up by way of answer that Burrows was not the purchaser, but that one Meacbam was; that the land had sold at an enormous sacrifice, the result of a fraudulent combination between Burrows, Meacbam, and Taylor, to prevent competition in the bidding.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b695-5\">The court below having heard the case on its merits dismissed Burrows\u2019s petition, and ordered him to pay all the costs.

The proceeding in which Burrows made his motion below was at law, and the motion was a motion at law. Under the act of 1803, indeed, <em>appeals </em>were allowed in a special class of eases, but this ease did not fall within that class.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b695-7\">\n<em>Messrs.

Wherefore the petitioner prayed the Circuit Court to lay a rule upon the appellee, as such marshal, to show cause at the next term of the court why he should not make to him as the purchaser a good and sufficient deed in fee simple of the described tract, and he also prayed for an order staying all further proceedings under the said other executions in his hands towards a resale of the premises which he purchased.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-6\">Subsequently the appellee appeared and filed an answer, and the record shows that the court, at the succeeding November Term, rendered judgment for the appellee, directing that the rule be discharged and that the petitioner pay all costs.. Whereupoii the petitioner appealed to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-7\">Such a motion as the one first described and the rule granted under it were proceedings at law, and so also were the judgment and the order of the court directing that the petitioner should pay all costs, and the court is of the opinion that the judgment could not be removed into this court in any other way than by a writ of error; that an appeal will not lie to this court in such a ease under the twenty-second section of the Judiciary Act, and that the appeal must be</p>\n<p id=\"b696-8\">Dismissed fob want of jubisdiction.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
