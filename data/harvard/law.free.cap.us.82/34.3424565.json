P. Chipman, for the soldier, and in support of the ruling below, </em>made a very full examination of the acts of Congress, and on an exhibit of their provisions, argued that there was nothing in any of them prohibiting the payment of bounty money to a soldier who had deserted, irrespectively of the circumstances of his desertion; that desertion, being sometimes a mere technical desertion, and without cowardice or disaffection to the service, did not <em>per se </em>so taint the <em>status </em>of the soldier, as to render him necessarily and without any judicial proceedings absolutely disqualified to receive bounty; nor was it under every circumstance such an act that his contract with the government was wholly and <em>ipso facto </em>dissolved, and that he could never return, and by performance of service properly thereafter\u2014 which service should be accepted \u2014 set up a condonation of his offence. The counsel argued that any other view would lead to the worst consequences in au army of a million of troops, called out as our troops were during the rebellion; troops comprising officers and men of inexperienced years; both officers and soldiers unacquainted with the laws of war; the soldiers especially unacquainted with the rigors of discipline, unused to the restraints which capricious or incompetent superior officers could enforce; not schooled nor proof against the evil influences of depraved associates, and liable, under some physical suffering or discouragement, or inadvertence, to commit an offence the gravity of which was not comprehended, and the penalty for which had not been understood or appreciated. The counsel fortified his views as to the effect of desertion in such a case'as the one before the court by references to the third edition, published in 1868, of the Digest of the present Judge Advocate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>General of the United States, the Hon. Joseph Holt, Esq.,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> whom he characterized as \u201c the most eminent and able writer on military law that this country had ever produced.\u201d</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b48-6\">\n<em>Mr. C.

The able lawyer who fills at present the post of Judge Advocate General, in a case similar to the present, held that \u201cthe honorable discharge of the deserter wras a formal final judgment passed by the government upon the entire military record of the soldier, and an authoritative declaration by it that he had left the service in a <em>status </em>of honor; that as such, it dispensed altogether with the supposed necessity that the soldier must obtain bountj- by removal, by order, of the charge of desertion from the rolls, and amo\u00fcnted of itself to the removal of any charge or impediment in the way of his receiving bounty.\u201d With this opinion we entirely concur.'</p>\n<p id=\"b48-9\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
