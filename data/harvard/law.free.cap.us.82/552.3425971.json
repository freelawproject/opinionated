The defendants, other than Frow, all put in answers to the bill on the merits; but Frow\u2019s answer having been delayed (as he insisted, by misunderstanding, sickness, and other accidents), a decree <em>pro confesso </em>was taken against him at September Rules, 1868; and notwithstanding he after-wards prepared his answer and asked leave to file it (being in substance the same as the answers of the other defendants), yet the court afterwards, on the 23d of March, 1870, on application of the complainant, and against the protestation of Frow, made a final decree absolute against him, adjudging the title of the land to be in the complainant, and awarding to him a perpetual injunction as against the appellant. From this decree the present appeal was taken. After this final decree against the appellant, the court proceeded to try the issues made by the answers of the other defendants, and decided the merits of the cause adversely to the complainant and dismissed his bill. This fact was made to appear by the return to a certiorari sued out by De La Vega himself.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b565-6\">The question now was, whether the court in such a case as that mentioned could lawfully make a final decree against one defendant separately, on the merits, whilst the cause was proceeding undetermined against the others.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b565-7\">\n<em>Mr. P. Phillips, for the appellant,</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Ay7\">argued that it was improper to have granted the pl-ayer against a single defendant whose interests were all bound up with those of the other defendants.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b565-8\">\n<em>Mr. T. J. Durant,contra,</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AGS\">insisted that everything done had been done in accordance with the 18th Rule in Equity, prescribed by this court.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b566-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>Mr. Justice BRADLEY</author>\n<p id=\"AoV\">delivered the opinion of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-6\">If the court in such a case as this can lawfully make a final decree against one defendant separately, on the merits, while the cause was proceeding undetermined against the others, then this absurdity might follow: there might be one decree of the court sustaining the charge of joint fraud committed by the defendants; and another decree disaffirming the said charge, and declaring it to be entirely unfounded, and dismissing the complainant\u2019s bill. And such an incongruity, it seems, did actually occur in this case. Such a state of things is unseemly and absurd, as well as unauthorized by law.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-7\">The true mode of proceeding where a bill makes a joint charge against several defendants, and one of them makes default, is simply to enter a default and a formal decree <em>pro confesso </em>against him, and proceed with the cause upon the answers of the other defendants. The defaulting defendant has merely lost his standing in court. He will not be entitled to service of notices in the cause, nor to appear in it in any way. He can adduce no evidence, he cannot be heard at the final hearing. But if the suit should be decided against the complainant on the merits, the bill will be dismissed as to all the defendants alike \u2014 the defaulter as well as.the others. If it be decided in the complainant\u2019s favor, he will then be entitled to a final decree against all. But a final decree on the merits against the defaulting defendant alone, pending the continuance of the cause, would be incongruous and illegal. This was so expressly decided by the New York Court of Errors, in the case of <em>Clason </em>v. <em>Morris.</em><footnotemark><em>*</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Spencer, J., says: \u201cIt would be unreasonable to hold, that because one defendant had made default, the plaintiff should have a decree even against him, where the court is satisfied from the proofs offered by the other, that in fact the plaintiff is not entitled to a decree.\u201d<footnotemark>\u2020</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b566-8\">Irregularities, if any occurred in the proceedings after <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>the decree complained of, are not now before us for adjudication.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-6\">Decree reversed with costs, and the cause remanded for further proceedings,</p>\n<p id=\"b567-7\">In conformity with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b566-9\"> 10 Johnson, 524.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"\u2020\">\n<p id=\"b566-10\"> See 1 Hoffman\u2019s Chancery Practice, 554.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
