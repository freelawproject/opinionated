The stock of S was destroyed accordingly. Almost immediately afterwards, the Confederate government, against the protest and remonstrance of the city council, set fire to certain tobacco warehouses and other buildings <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number><em>near </em>the premises where S had his liquors,'whereby the premises of S. and his liquors were destroyed.

R. Page, for the city, plaintiff in error:</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b446-7\">There was error in overruling the demurrer to the special count in the declaration.</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b446-8\">The liability of the city, if any there be, for the destruetion of the plaintiff\u2019s liquors, can only be upheld upon the ground that the city made a valid contract to pay for their value. The destruction of this property was not a taking of private property for public uses, for which compensation is required to be made. The resolves of the city council were made and executed for the public weal, at a time of imminent peril. The rights of private property, sacred as they are, must yield to the higher demands of the public safety. In such cases <em>solus populi, suprema est lex. </em>The proceedings upon which the plaintiff below rested his claim, are like those where an individual or a municipality <em>raze </em>houses to prevent the spread of an existing conflagration; and it is well settled that this may be done without responsibility to the owner for the damages he sustains.</p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b446-9\">In <em>Blouse\u2019s Case</em><footnotemark><em>*</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Lord Coke says:</p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b446-10\">\u201cFor the commonwealth, a man shall suffer damage, as for the saving of a eity or town, a house shall be plucked down if the next be on fire. This every man may do, without being liable to an action.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b446-11\">There was, therefore, no consideration for the undertaking of the city to pay the value of the liquors destroyed. The judge who delivered the opinion derives the power of the city to make the order and pledge, from the <em>general welfare </em>clause in the charter. Similar provisions are to be found in the charter of nearly every municipality in the land, and yet it is believed no case can be found where the exercise of such powers has been maintained, unless there was express authority therefor, either in the charter or some <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>general statute. It is manifest that the language of this general provision must be construed with reference to the other powers granted the city, otherwise the specific grant of powers would have been useless, and it is further manifest that the power to be exercised under these general words, must be exercised by fixed by-laws, rules, or ordinances, and not by some isolated and instantaneous act.</p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b447-5\">The decision is questioned by Dillon in his able treatise on Municipal Corporations,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> and it is there intimated that the order for the destruction of liquors was not within the scope of the corporate powers of the city.</p>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b447-6\">But if the decision in <em>Jones &amp; Co. </em>v. <em>The City of Richmond, </em>as to the validity of this contract, be binding in this forum because it may be regarded as a local question, then it is insisted that the defendant in error has not brought himself within the terms of the resolutions of the council so as to entitle him to maintain this suit. He holds no receipt from the commissioners authorized to destroy the property, and the faith of the city is pledged only to those who hold such receipts.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b447-7\">\n<em>Mr. W.

That it is the imperative duty of this council, in ease of the evacuation of this city by the government and army, to provide as far as it can for the immediate destruction of the stock of liquor in the city. (2.) That a committee of twenty-five citizens in each ward be appointed by the president to act in behalf of the city and proceed at once to accomplish this object; that said committee destroy on the premises all the liquor they can find, giving receipts for the same to the holders. (3.) That the faith of the city <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>be, and is hereby, pledged for the payment of the value of all liquors so destroyed to the holders of said receipts.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-6\">Such evacuation of the said city by the government and army as that contemplated by the first resolution did occur during the evening of that day and the morning of the next day, and it appears that the committee contemplated by the second resolution was appointed, and that they, on the following day, in pursuance of said second resolution, destroyed on the premises of the plaintiff the liquors mentioned in the declaration, of the value specified in the bill of particulars filed in the case and annexed to the declaration.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-7\">Payment having been refused the plaintiff brought an action of assumpsit against the corporation defendants to recover the value of the liquors destroyed, as promised in the third resolution. Service was made, and the defendants having entered their appearance demurred to the special count, but the court overruled the demurrer and the parties having waived a jury submitted the cause under the pleadings to the decision of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-8\">Two pleas were pleaded by the defendants, as follows: (1.) That they never undertook and promised as alleged in the declaration. (2.) That prior to the destruction of the liquors as alleged, the Confederate government determined, in case the city should be evacuated as supposed, to set fire to the warehouses and other buildings in the city, and that they did on that day set fire to such warehouses and buildings, including the premises of the plaintiff, and that the same were destroyed by fire; that the building in which the liquors were stored took fire shortly after the liquors were destroyed, and was consumed, and that the liquors, if they had not been destroyed, would have been consumed.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-9\">Issue was joined upon the first plea and the plaintiff' demurred to the second, and the court sustained the demurrer and held the plea to be insufficient. Evidence rvas introduced by the plaintiff and the court rendered judgment in his favor for the sum of two thousand eight hundred and thirty-two dollars, and the defendants excepted and removed the cause into this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>Before proceeding to examine the questions which have been discussed at the bar, it becomes necessary to refer to certain other portions of the record, and more particularly to the agreement signed by the counsel waiving a trial by jury and submitting all questions of law and fact arising on the trial of the cause to the decision of the court. By that agreement it is also stipulated that the court may <em>\u201c </em>draw all the inferences and conclusions that a jury is authorized to draw from the evidence, and with liberty to either party to except to the judgment of the court in the same manner and to the same exteut that he might except to the verdict of a jury, and to object to the same for the same reasons.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b449-5\">Parties have a right to waive a trial by jury and submit the issues of fact to the determination of the Circuit Court, but they cannot by any such agreement make it the duty of this court to draw inferences and conclusions of fact from the evidence, nor to examine such inferences and conclusions of fact as may be drawn from the evidence by the Circuit Court.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b449-6\">Pursuant to that agreement the court made a general finding as follows: <em>\u201c </em>The court finds the facts for the plaintiff,\u201d and rendered judgment that the plaintiff recover of the defendants the sum of two thousand eight hundred and thirty-two dollars, with interest. Exceptions were taken at the time to the opinions of the court given against the defendants, but there is no exception to any ruling of the court in admitting or rejecting evidence, and no prayers for instructions of any kind were presented to the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-7\">Issues of fact in civil causes pending in the Circuit Courts may, if the parties so agree, be tried and determined by the court without the intervention of a jury, but such a submission necessarily implies that the facts shall be found by the court, and the act provides that the finding may be either general or special, and that.it shall have the same effect as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>the verdict of a jury. Consequently where the finding is general nothing is open to review hut the rulings or, perhaps, the instructions of the court as presented in a bill of exceptions, which is sufficient to show that nothing is open to reexamination in this case except the ruling of the court in sustaining the demurrer of the plaintiff to the second plea of the defendants.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b450-5\">Much discussion of that question is certainly not required, as the theory of the plea is that if the defendants had not destroyed the liquors they would have been destroyed by fire, which is alleging what cannot be known, as the liquors might have been rescued from the conflagration by the energy of the citizens or of the police. Impending dangers give no immunity to one man to destroy the property of another. As well may a man in good health claim the right to take the life of his neighbor who is sick, and ofler as a defence for his crime that the sick man would have died of his disease if he, the defendant, had withheld the mortal blow.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-6\">Suppose, however, the exceptions to the judgment are sufficient to raise the questions which the defendants desire to present for decision, still the court would feel constrained to affirm the judgment upon the ground that the Supreme Court of the State have decided in an analogous case that the corporate authorities of the city had authority uuder the charter of the city to make the order for the destruction of the liquors and to give the pledge for payment, and that the defendants are responsible for the value of the liquors destroyed under that order. State courts certainty' have a right to expound the statutes of the State, and having done so, those statutes, with the interpretation given to them by the highest court of the State, become the rules of decision in the Federal eourts.<footnotemark>\u2020</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b451-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>Viewed in any reasonable light, the court is of the opinion that there \u00cd3 no error in the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-5\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b449-8\"> Shankland <em>v. </em>Washington, 5 Peters, 397; Suydam <em>v. </em>Williamson, 20 Howard, 434.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b450-7\"> Miller <em>v. </em>Life Insurance Co., 12 Wallace, 295; 13 Stat. at Large, 501; Bond <em>v. </em>Brown, 12 Howard, 254; Saulet <em>v. </em>Shepherd, 4 Wallace, 502.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"\u2020\">\n<p id=\"b450-8\"> Jones <em>v. </em>Richmond, 18 Grattan, 517; Leffingwell <em>v. </em>Warren, 2 Black, 603.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-5\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b451-6\">Mr. Justice BRADLEY,</author>\n<p id=\"A9SP\">dissenting:</p>\n<p id=\"b451-7\">I dissent from the judgment of the court in this case. A resolution adopted by the common council of an insurgent city just before its occupation by our armies, for the purpose of keeping any class of property out of its hands by destroying the same, is a sheer act of war, and no contract or stipulation for indemnity to persons whose property was thus destroyed had auy validity after the collapse of the Confederacy. The owners of tobacco, cotton, or machinery destroyed on similar occasions are just as much entitled to set up stipulations for indemnity. The wounded soldier has just as good a right to claim damages from the Confederate soldier who wounded him.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
