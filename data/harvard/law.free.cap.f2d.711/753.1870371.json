(\u201cBlackhawk\u201d), a Kentucky surface mining company, appeals from a summary judgment against it sustaining the constitutionality of section 518(c) of the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 (\u201cthe Act\u201d), 30 U.S.C. \u00a7 1268(c). Blackhawk argues that this section\u2019s requirement of prepayment of proposed penalty assessments into escrow as a condition for formal review violates procedural due process under the Fifth Amendment. We disagree and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-21\">The material facts are undisputed. On December 12,1978, Blackhawk was notified of three violations of the Act.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On January 25, 1979, the Office of Surface Mining (\u201cOSM\u201d) of the Department of Interior advised Blackhawk that a penalty of $5,500 had been proposed for the violations.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> An <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"755\">*755</page-number>Assessment Conference was held April 25, 1977 at Blackhawk\u2019s request pursuant to 30 C.F.R. \u00a7 723.17(a) at which the penalty was reduced to $1,900. Blackhawk then filed a petition for review with the Office of Hearings and Appeals, but refused to deposit the assessment in escrow. The petition was dismissed on June 1,1979 for failure to pay the proposed penalties into escrow.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-5\">Blackhawk brought this suit against the Secretary of Interior (\u201cthe Secretary\u201d) on August 6, 1979 seeking a declaratory judgment that 30 U.S.C. \u00a7 1268 violates the Fifth Amendment due process clause. Blackhawk argued that the prepayment requirement worked a deprivation of its property without an adequate hearing. The Secretary denied the allegation and counterclaimed for the amount of the unpaid penalty. The district court granted the Secretary\u2019s motion for summary judgment and entered final judgment in favor of the Secretary. Blackhawk appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-6\">Section 1268 provides civil penalties for violation of the Act\u2019s environmental impact provision. In pertinent part, the section provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b839-7\">(b) Hearing</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b839-8\">A civil penalty shall be assessed by the Secretary only after the person charged with a violation described under subsection (a) of this section has been given an opportunity for a public hearing. Where such a public hearing has been held, the Secretary shall make findings of fact, and he shall issue a written decision as to the occurrence of the violation and the amount of the penalty which is warranted, incorporating, when appropriate, an order therein requiring that the penalty be paid. When appropriate, the Secretary shall consolidate such hearings with other proceedings under section 1271 of this title. Any hearing under this section shall be of record and shall be subject to section 554 of Title 5. Where the person charged with such a violation fails to avail himself of the opportunity for a public hearing, a civil penalty shall be assessed by the Secretary after the Secretary has determined that a violation did occur, and the amount of the penalty which is warranted, and has issued an order requiring that the penalty be paid,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A7l\">(c) Notice of violation; action required of violators; waiver of legal rights</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AZBH\">Upon the issuance of a notice or order charging that a violation of this chapter has occurred, the Secretary shall inform the operator within thirty days of the proposed amount of said penalty. The person charged with the penalty shall then have thirty days to pay the proposed penalty in full or, if the person wishes to contest either the amount of the penalty or the fact of the violation, forward the proposed amount to the Secretary for placement in an escrow account. If through administrative or judicial review of the proposed penalty, it is determined that no violation occurred, or that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"756\">*756</page-number>amount of the penalty should be reduced, the Secretary shall within thirty days remit the appropriate amount to the person, with interest at the rate of 6 percent, or at the prevailing Department of the Treasury rate, whichever is greater. Failure to forward the money to the Secretary within thirty days shall result in a waiver of all legal rights to contest the violation or the amount of the penalty.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AFP\">30 U.S.C. \u00a7 1268(b) and (c). There is no dispute that section 1268(c) requires prepayment of assessed penalties before obtaining formal administrative review before an administrative law judge. Essentially, Black-hawk challenges the adequacy of the Act\u2019s procedural and administrative safeguards.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-4\">The Act and the regulations promulgated under it prescribe various administrative procedures and appeal rights for mine operators. These procedures and rights apply whenever a mine operator is issued a Notice of Violation. 30 U.S.C. \u00a7 1271(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b840-5\">Within ten days of service of a Notice of Violation, an operator may submit written information concerning the violation to the OSM Assessment Office. Any such information must be considered by the Assessment Office in determining whether to assess a civil penalty and the amount of the penalty. 30 C.F.R. \u00a7 723.17(a). Blackhawk failed to exercise this prerogative although advised of it in the Notice of Violation. Within 30 days of the issuance of a Notice of Violation, the Assessment Office must inform the operator of its decision to assess a penalty and serve a copy of any proposed assessment on the operator. 30 U.S.C. \u00a7 1268(c); 30 C.F.R. \u00a7 723.17(c). A Notice of Proposed Assessment was timely served on Blackhawk.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-6\">Within 30 days of the issuance of a Notice of Violation, the operator may apply for formal review of the citation. 30 U.S.C. \u00a7 1275(a)(1); 43 C.F.R. \u00a7 4.1162. The operator is entitled to a full, adversarial, eviden-tiary hearing before an administrative law judge, who reviews the validity of the citation and has authority to vacate, affirm, or modify it. Temporary relief may be requested. 30 U.S.C. \u00a7 1275(c); 43 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 4.1260-1267. Appeals to an administrative review board (Board of Surface Mining and Reclamation Appeals) and district court judicial review rights are also available. 43 C.F.R. \u00a7 4.1270; 30 U.S.C. \u00a7 1276(a). Blackhawk did not avail itself of these procedures.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-9\">Within 15 days of receipt of a Notice of Proposed Assessment of a civil penalty, the operator may request an informal conference to review the amount of the penalty. 30 C.F.R. \u00a7 723.18(a). Prepayment of the proposed penalty into escrow is not a prerequisite to this \u201cassessment conference.\u201d The conference is conducted by an OSM employee with no previous connection with the case. The operator may be represented by counsel. The Assessment Office must consider any information presented by the operator at the conference. 30 C.F.R. \u00a7 723.18(b). Blackhawk took advantage of this procedure and was successful in having the proposed penalty reduced from $5,500 to $1,900.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-10\">Finally, within 15 days of the assessment conference\u2019s conclusion (if one has been requested) or within 30 days of receipt of the Notice of Violation, the operator may obtain formal review of both the validity of the citation and amount of the penalty, provided it deposits the full amount of the proposed penalty into an escrow account. 30 U.S.C. \u00a7 1268(c); 43 C.F.R. \u00a7 4.1152(b)(1). This final administrative remedy entails a full, adversarial, evidentia-ry hearing before an administrative law judge. Following the hearing, any amount found to have been improperly assessed must be refunded with interest. If the operator fails to deposit the full amount of the proposed penalty in escrow, however, all legal rights to contest the violation or amount of the penalty are waived. 30 U.S.C. \u00a7 1268(c). Blackhawk refused to escrow the proposed penalty as required. Both the Notice of Violation and Notice of Proposed Assessment explained these administrative remedies to Blackhawk.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-12\">Although several district courts have upheld the Act\u2019s escrow requirement, see, <em>e.g., John Walters Coal Co. v. Watt, </em>553 F.Supp. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"757\">*757</page-number>838 (E.D.Ky.1982); <em>United States v. Log Mountain Mining Co., </em>550 F.Supp. 811 (E.D. Tenn.1982); <em>United States v. Hill, </em>533 F.Supp. 810 (E.D.Tenn.1982); <em>United States v. Thompson Brothers Coal Co., Inc., </em>532 F.Supp. 979 (W.D.Pa.) <em>rev\u2019d without published op., </em>696 F.2d 986 (3d Cir.1982),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> only one circuit court has had an opportunity to address the issue. <em>B &amp; M Coal Corp. v. Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement, </em>699 F.2d 381 (7th Cir.1983). It upheld section 1268(c) as well. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b841-4\">While the fundamental requirement of procedural due process is the opportunity to be heard \u201cat a meaningful time and in a meaningful manner,\u201d <em>Armstrong v. Manzo, </em>380 U.S. 545, 552, 85 S.Ct. 1187, 1191, 14 L.Ed.2d 62 (1965), \u201cdue process is flexible and calls for such procedural protections as the particular situation demands.\u201d <em>Morrissey v. Brewer, </em>408 U.S. 471, 481, 92 S.Ct. 2593, 2600, 33 L.Ed.2d 484 (1972). Three factors must be considered in determining whether the Act\u2019s statutory scheme denies procedural due process:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b841-5\">First, the private interest that will be affected by the official action; second, the risk of an erroneous deprivation of such interest through the procedures used, and the probable value, if any, of additional or substitute procedural safeguards; and finally, the Government\u2019s interest, including the function involved and the fiscal and administrative burdens that the additional or substitute procedural requirement would entail. <em>See, e.g., Goldberg v. Kelly, supra, </em>[397 U.S. 254] at 263-271 [90 S.Ct. 1011, at 1018-1022, 25 L.Ed.2d 287],</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b841-6\"><em>Mathews v. Eldridge, </em>424 U.S. 319, 335, 96 S.Ct. 893, 903, 47 L.Ed.2d 18 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b841-7\">Blackhawk\u2019s only private interest in this case is the temporary deprivation of its money. The district court found the degree of potential deprivation \u201cslight and significantly less than that of the welfare recipient in <em>Goldberg v. Kelly, </em>397 U.S. 254, 90 S.Ct. 1011, 25 L.Ed.2d 287 (1970).\u201d We agree. Section 1268(c) requires reimbursement of improperly assessed penalties within 30 days with interest. Although in certain circumstances the prepayment requirement might possibly cause an operator to forego a business opportunity, this private interest is not of sufficient magnitude to overcome the government\u2019s interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-10\">The risk of an erroneous deprivation of Blackhawk\u2019s property interest under the Act\u2019s procedures is also slight. As described above, the Act prescribes several procedural safeguards, including an opportunity to submit written information and the right to an informal conference. As the Seventh Circuit concluded in <em>B &amp; M Coal Corp.:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"aln-dedup-0\">[T]he consequences of an operator\u2019s failure to take advantage of the relief available [does not] render[ ] the statutory scheme unconstitutional. The Act and its pertinent regulations are in accord with the \u201cordinary principle ... that something less than an evidentiary hearing is sufficient prior to adverse administrative action.\u201d <em>Mackey v. Montrym, </em>443 U.S. [1] at 13, 99 S.Ct. [2612] at 2618 [61 L.Ed.2d 321] (citations omitted).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b841-11\">699 F.2d at 385-86.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-12\">Finally, the district court correctly concluded that the government\u2019s interest in prompt assessment and collection of civil penalties to ensure compliance with the Act is substantial. The prepayment requirement was adopted to avoid the problem of noncollection of fines and to discourage delay of the collection process through frivolous appeals. S.Rep. No. 95-128, 95th Cong., 1st Sess. 58-59 (1977). We believe the legislative history reflects a rational basis for this provision. <em>See </em>1977 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News 593-747; <em>see also, Hodel v. Virginia Surface Mining and Reclamation Ass\u2019n, </em>452 U.S. 264,101 S.Ct. 2352, 69 L.Ed.2d 1 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b842-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"758\">*758</page-number>\u25a0 Considering these three factors together, we conclude that the Act\u2019s procedural safeguards in connection with the section 1268(c) escrow requirement satisfy the demands of due process. Therefore, the judgment of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b838-11\">.
