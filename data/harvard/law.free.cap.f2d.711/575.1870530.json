Roger Lawler, individually, and several related enterprises. At stake are the valuable bleached bones of the Lawler Cattle Company (L.C. C.), an ill-fated venture which amassed some two million dollars in losses in its approximately one and one-half years of operation. In this separate suit, instituted by trustee in bankruptcy L.E. Creel III, the bankruptcy court ruled that L.C.C. was Roger Lawler\u2019s \u201calter ego\u201d for \u201call purposes.\u201d The district court affirmed on the ground that the bankruptcy court\u2019s findings were not clearly erroneous. The United States, which has filed twelve million dollars worth of tax claims against Roger Lawler, argues that for taxation purposes L.C.C.\u2019s corporate identity should be respected and the cattle operation losses attributed to the corporation rather than to Lawler personally. We agree. Accordingly, we reverse the district court and the bankruptcy court and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-17\">Lawler Cattle Company was incorporated in Nevada in June 1973. The bankruptcy court found, and it is undisputed, that L.C. C.\u2019s initial and only capital contribution, $1,000, was advanced by Roger Lawler and that the corporation was formed primarily for the purpose of managing Roger Lawler\u2019s ranch and cattle. After its formation, L.C.C. was substituted for Roger Lawler as debtor on a promissory note to the First National Bank of Nevada and as borrower on the agreement providing the Bank with a security interest in the cattle to be purchased. Between August 31,1973 and February 13, 1974, L.C.C. procured loans from the Bank totaling in excess of 3.4 million dollars.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> During its brief and catastrophic existence, L.C.C. employed as many as 24 people.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-18\">As the cattle purchased were not suited to the desert environment of the Nevada <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>ranch, L.C.C. incurred severe losses. It filed a corporate tax return for its fiscal operating year 1973, showing a net operating loss of $2,207,471.42.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> L.C.C. ceased operations sometime in 1974.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-5\">\n<em>The Magnificent Chapter Seven</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"A5M\">On January 9, 1976, in Nevada, involuntary petitions were filed under Chapter VII of the old Bankruptcy Act against Roger Lawler and Lawler Land and Cattle Company.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The petitions were contested and venue transferred to the northern district of Texas, where the United States filed its proofs of claim for approximately twelve million dollars in income taxes due from Roger Lawler individually. Roger Lawler consented to adjudication. Thereafter, the appointed trustee, Creel, successfully applied for orders declaring Lawler Corporation, Lawler Family Trust and Lawler Management Company to have been from their inception alter egos of Roger Lawler for all purposes. On June 20, 1979, the bankruptcy court issued such an order regarding L.C.C. After it was determined that L.C.C. was not even a party and hence was not properly before the court, the trustee instituted the present proceeding seeking to have L.C.C. declared Roger Lawler\u2019s alter ego. The government filed a motion for dismissal arguing that the order should not be granted insofar as it would require that L.C.C.\u2019s corporate entity be disregarded for taxation purposes. On April 28,1980, after hearing, the bankruptcy court (1) denied the United States\u2019 motion and decreed that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b661-16\">(2) Lawler Cattle Co. is now, and at all times since its inception has been, the alter ego of H. Roger Lawler for all purposes; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b661-17\">(3) The assets of Lawler Cattle Co. as of January 9, 1976 were the assets of H. Roger Lawler, the Debtor herein, subject to the payment of the claims of all creditors of the Debtor herein.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b662-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>The district court affirmed in November, 1981.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-4\">\n<em>The Eyes of Taxes</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b662-5\">The sole issue before us is whether the district court was in error in declaring L.C.C. to have been Roger Lawler\u2019s alter ego <em>for all purposes, </em>and in declaring the assets of L.C.C. to have been the assets of Roger Lawler, insofar as that order required the corporation to be disregarded for tax purposes. The government has never challenged that aspect of the alter ego determination which allows L.C.C.\u2019s creditors to reach Roger Lawler\u2019s individual assets, whatever those may be. That portion of the order stands. Because L.C.C. clearly meets the standard enunciated by the Supreme Court in <em>Moline Properties, Inc. v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, </em>319 U.S. 436, 63 S.Ct. 1132, 87 L.Ed. 1499 (1943), however, we reverse the bankruptcy court\u2019s order insofar as it disregards L.C.C.\u2019s corporate identity for income tax purposes.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b662-6\">In <em>Moline Properties, </em>the Court stated, The doctrine of corporate entity fills a useful purpose in business life. Whether the purpose be to gain an advantage under the law of the state of incorporation or to avoid or to comply with the demands of creditors or to serve the creator\u2019s personal or undisclosed convenience, so long as that purpose is the equivalent of business activity or is followed by the carrying on of business by the corporation, the corporation remains a separate taxable entity, [citations omitted] 319 U.S. at 438-39, 63 S.Ct. at 1133-34, 87 L.Ed. at 1502.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b662-16\">Clearly, under <em>Moline Properties, </em>L.C.C. is a separate taxable entity. Although only one of the two parts of the <em>Moline Properties </em>test need be satisfied, it is patently obvious that L.C.C. was both organized for a business purpose and actually carried on business activity. As the bankruptcy court itself found, L.C.C. was formed \u201cprimarily for the purpose of managing the ranch and the cattle owned by H. Roger Lawler.\u201d This business purpose alone is sufficient to satisfy the <em>Moline Properties </em>standard. Moreover, it is undisputed that L.C.C. obtained loans of over $3,000,000, employed a number of people, bought and sold cattle,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>executed promissory notes, filed tax returns, negotiated for the purchase of land, and defended itself in a lawsuit.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Plainly, L.C.C. was both organized for a business purpose and actually carried on business activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-5\">The Trustee steers our attention toward the Supreme Court\u2019s observation in <em>Moline Properties </em>that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b663-6\">In general, in matters relating to the revenue, the corporate form may be disregarded where it is a sham or unreal. In such situations the form is a bald and mischievous fiction, [citations omitted]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A5P\">319 U.S. at 439,63 S.Ct. at 1134, 87 L.Ed. at 1503.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-7\">The Trustee argues that \u201calter ego\u201d and \u201csham\u201d are synonymous and that therefore \u2014 because of the bankruptcy court\u2019s finding of alter ego \u2014 L.C.C.\u2019s corporate form must be disregarded \u201cas a bald and mischievous fiction.\u201d The fact is, however, that in the corporate context, \u201calter ego\u201d and \u201csham\u201d are not synonymous, as the case law illustrates. A sham corporation may be one established for no valid purpose, such as a corporation formed solely for the purpose of escaping taxation, <em>see National Carbide, </em>336 U.S. at 437, n. 20, 69 S.Ct. at 734, n. 20, 93 L.Ed. at 788, or defrauding creditors, <em>see Paymer v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, </em>150 F.2d 334 (2d Cir. 1945). As the Supreme Court pointed out in <em>National Carbide,</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b663-8\">[The Court of Appeals] held that under our decisions, when a corporation carries on business activity the fact that the owner retains direction of its affairs down to the minutest detail, provides all of its assets and takes all of its profits can make no difference tax-wise.... The result reached by the Court of Appeals is clearly required by our later decisions. 336 U.S. at 431-32, 69 S.Ct. at 731, 93 L.Ed. at 785.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b663-14\">Clearly such a corporation might be held to be an alter ego for the purpose of piercing the corporate veil and allowing the corporate creditors to reach the assets of the individual.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> So long as the corporation meets the test set forth in <em>Moline Properties, </em>however, it remains a separate taxable entity. As the Court of Claims expressed it in <em>Harrison Property Management Co., Inc. v. United States, </em>475 F.2d 623, 626 (Ct.Cl. 1973),</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b663-15\">Where individuals adopt the corporate form for purposes of their own, the choice of the advantages of incorporation to do business requires \u2018the acceptance of the tax disadvantages.\u2019 <em>[Moline Properties, </em>319 U.S. at 439, 63 S.Ct. at 1134, 87 L.Ed. at 1503] It is immaterial that the shareholders remain the beneficial owners of the property transferred to the company, or that the latter\u2019s policies and day-to-day activities are determined, not as decisions of the corporation, but by the owners acting individually. <em>National Carbide Corp. v. Commissioner, supra, </em>336 U.S. at 433-34, 69 S.Ct. at 732; <em>Tomlinson v. Miles, supra, </em>316 F.2d at 714; <em>Carver v. United States, supra, </em>412 F.2d [233] at 239, 188 Ct.Cl. [202] at 212-13. By the same token, it does not matter that the corporation is regarded by its owners as a simple \u2018dummy\u2019. <em>National Carbide Corp. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number><em>v. Commissioner, supra, </em>336 U.S. at 433, 69 S.Ct. at 732; <em>Love v. United States, supra, </em>96 F.Supp. [919] at 922, 119 Ct.Cl. [384] at 405. The controlling tests, ignoring the fact that the corporation is substantially the <em>alter ego </em>of the stockholders, concentrate on the reasons why the \u2018dummy\u2019 was created, and what it actually does, [emphasis in original]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b664-4\"><em>See also Evans v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, </em>557 F.2d 1095 (5th Cir.1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b664-5\">The trustee argues that <em>Moline Properties </em>is built on the equitable principle that a taxpayer who chooses the corporate form must accept the disadvantages as well as the advantages of that form. <em>See </em>319 U.S. at 439, 63 S.Ct. at 1134, 87 L.Ed. at 1503. That principle, he argues, is not relevant to this situation in bankruptcy, where respecting the corporate entity may preclude L.C. C.\u2019s losses from being attributed to Roger Lawler personally and thus reduce the assets available to Roger Lawler\u2019s creditors, other than the government. We do not believe, however, that equity calls for the sudden abandonment of a corporation\u2019s independently taxable status once a bankruptcy petition is filed. Indeed, equity argues for the corporation to be treated consistently with the principles of taxation which governed its formation and existence. We are convinced that the <em>Moline Properties </em>test for determining whether a corporation is a separate taxable entity applies to this situation.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-6\">The trustee argues also that L.C.C. is exempt from taxation under the exception for the income of \u201ctrue corporate agents\u201d, articulated in <em>National Carbide.</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b664-7\">What we have said does not foreclose a true corporate agent or trustee from handling the property and income of its owner-principal without being taxable therefor. Whether the corporation operates in the name and for the account of the principal, binds the principal by its actions, transmits money received to the principal, and whether receipt of income is attributable to the services of employees of the principal and to assets belonging to the principal are some of the relevant considerations in determining whether a true agency exists. If the corporation is a true agent, its relations with its principal must not be dependent upon the fact that it is owned by the principal, if such is the case. Its business purpose must be the carrying on of the normal duties of an agent.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b664-10\">336 U.S. at 437, 69 S.Ct. at 734, 93 L.Ed. at 788.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-11\">We are skeptical of the claim that L.C. C.\u2019s relations with Roger Lawler were independent of Lawler\u2019s ownership and control of the corporation, as required by <em>National Carbide. </em>Indeed, the bankruptcy court\u2019s finding that L.C.C. was Roger Lawler\u2019s alter ego almost necessarily forecloses that possibility. As this issue was neither raised before nor decided by the court below, however, we need not and do not decide whether L.C.C. is exempt from taxation as Roger Lawler\u2019s agent.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b664-12\">Finally, the trustee points to \u00a7\u00a7 671-77 of the Internal Revenue Code, 26 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 671-77, which deal with the circumstances under which trust income deductions and credits may be attributed to trust grantors for purposes of taxation. Under these sections of the Internal Revenue Code, a grantor\u2019s retention of any of several enumerated powers over a trust may cause trust assets to be attributed to the grantor for tax purposes. The trustee argues that, by analogy, an individual\u2019s control of the assets of an alter ego corporation must call for the abandonment of the corporation as a separate taxable entity, because the individual\u2019s control of the corporation is likely to be far greater than the individual\u2019s control over the trusts described in the Internal Revenue Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-13\">We find no merit in either the analogy or the argument. Sections 671-77 of the In<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>ternal Revenue Code \u2014 which deal exclusively with trusts \u2014 in no way reflect the manner in which the assets of corporations should be treated for income tax purposes. <em>Moline Properties, </em>not irrelevant sections of the Internal Revenue Code, sets forth the test for deciding when the corporate entity is to be disregarded for income tax purposes. So long as the purpose of incorporation \u201cis the equivalent of business activity or is followed by the carrying on of business by the corporation,\u201d the corporate identity is to be respected and maintained.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-5\">\n<em>Happy Trials</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b665-6\">The bankruptcy court erred in determining that L.C.C.\u2019s assets were to be considered those of Roger Lawler individually, insofar as that order required the disregard of L.C.C. as an independent taxable entity. The district court erred in affirming the bankruptcy court\u2019s order in this respect.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-7\">REVERSED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b660-12\">. Apparently, the outstanding debt at any one time never exceeded $2,234,886.65.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b661-6\">. Approximately 1.6 million dollars of the loss was from the sale of goods \u2014 the loss from the sale of the cattle. The remainder was primarily attributable to ranch expenses and interest payments.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b661-7\">. Lawler Cattle Company and Lawler Land and Cattle Company are not the same entity. L.C.C. is the corporation whose taxable status is at issue here, while L.L.C.C. apparently was simply a company name under which Roger Lawler conducted some business.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b661-8\">. The court\u2019s complete findings and conclusions are set forth below:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b661-9\">1. On June 4,1973, Lawler Cattle Co. was formed as a Nevada corporation. The initial capital contribution of $1,000.00 was advanced by H. Roger Lawler. No other capital contributions were ever made.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b661-10\">2. Lawler Cattle Co. was formed primarily for the purpose of managing the ranch and the cattle owned by H. Roger Lawler. Lawler Cattle Co. was to receive a 15 percent net profits interest in consideration for its management activities.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b661-11\">3. Lawler Cattle Co. managed only those cattle owned by H. Roger Lawler and never owned any cattle of its own.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b661-12\">4. On June 4, 1973, H. Roger Lawler was appointed President of Lawler Cattle Co. He additionally assumed the responsibilities of general manager on January 2, 1974.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b661-13\">5. At all times since the formation of Lawler Cattle Co., H. Roger Lawler has completely dominated, controlled and managed the assets and the business transactions and affairs of Lawler Cattle Co., treating its business and properties as his own, and operating it as an instrumentality of and agent for himself and for his own purposes in total disregard of the corporate form.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b661-19\">6. The verified schedules of H. Roger Lawler filed herein list debts of Lawler Cattle Co. as being debts of H. Roger Lawler, and include Lawler Cattle Co. as a name under which H. Roger Lawler has conducted his business.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b661-20\">7. The creditors of Lawler Cattle Co., in extending substantial credit to Lawler Cattle Co., were of the belief that Lawler Cattle Co. was H. Roger Lawler and that the credit extended was, in truth and in fact, extended to H. Roger Lawler.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b661-21\">8. Such creditors have filed claims in this proceeding and have participated herein as creditors of H. Roger Lawler. To treat Lawler Cattle Co. as an entity separate and distinct from H. Roger Lawler would perpetrate a fraud upon those creditors who extended credit to Lawler Cattle Co.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b661-22\">9. The assets of Lawler Cattle Co. were insufficient to provide adequate security for its indebtedness to the First National Bank of Nevada.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b661-23\">10. Lawler Cattle Co. was undercapital-ized for its purposes at its inception and at all times thereafter.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b661-24\">11. Lawler Cattle Co. is now, and at all times since its inception has been, the alter ego of H. Roger Lawler.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AZD\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>12. There is no evidence in the record that the Plaintiffs purpose in filing his Complaint was to acquire the net operating loss of Lawler Cattle Co. for the benefit of H.

The bankruptcy court found that \u201cLawler Cattle Co. managed only those cattle owned by H. Roger Lawler and never owned any cattle of its own.\u201d It is clear from the record, however, that L.C.C. held record title to at least some of the cattle. The parties disagree as to whether L.C.C. or Roger Lawler had legal and equitable ownership of the livestock. Past cases reveal that the answer to the question of who has legal or equitable ownership of some or all corporate assets does not determine a corporation\u2019s status for taxation purposes.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b662-18\">The taxpayers take the position that the mere carrying on of business by the corporation, to satisfy this requirement of the Moline Properties case, must be business relating to property to which it has title, either legal or equitable. They contend that this corporation was the holder of a mere naked record title with neither legal nor equitable ownership of the property and that therefore such business as was carried on by the corporation does not fall within the formula that is above set out.
