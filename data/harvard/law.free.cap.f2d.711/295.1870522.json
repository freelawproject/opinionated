The ICC declined to impose any protective conditions, finding that none of the petitioners had shown that the conditions it requested were needed to prevent the loss of \u201cessential services.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b384-5\">Petitioners appeal to this court, claiming that the ICC\u2019s \u201cessential services\u201d test for imposing protective conditions is too strict and does not comply with the statutory directive that the ICC consider the effect of the merger on \u201cadequacy of transportation to the public.\u201d 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 11,344(b)(1). Petitioners also argue that some of the ICC\u2019s findings are not supported by substantial evidence and that the ICC committed a variety of procedural errors. We reject the procedural challenges as either without merit or not constituting prejudicial error. We conclude, however, that the ICC\u2019s essential services test, as applied to petitioner Lamoille Valley Railroad, does not comport with the statute. We also find flaws in the agency\u2019s reasoning with regard to protective conditions requested by petitioner Canadian National Railway. We therefore affirm in part, reverse in part, and remand to the ICC to determine whether protective conditions are needed to protect the public\u2019s right to adequate transportation.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-10\">I. Statutory and Factual Background</p>\n<p id=\"b384-11\">A. <em>The Statutory Scheme</em></p>\n<p id=\"b384-12\">1. <em>Specific Provisions Governing Railroad Mergers</em></p>\n<p id=\"b384-13\">Interstate Commerce Act, 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 11,343(a), requires the ICC to review all railroad mergers.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The ICC must approve any merger that is \u201cconsistent with the public interest,\u201d but can impose conditions on the merger when needed to advance the public interest:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b384-14\">The Commission shall approve and authorize a [merger] when it finds the transaction is consistent with the public interest. The Commission may impose conditions governing the transaction.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b385-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number><em>Id. </em>\u00a7 11,344(c).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In making the \u201cpublic interest\u201d determination for a proposed merger of two \u201cclass I\u201d railroads,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> the ICC must consider five specific (but not exclusive) factors:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b385-5\">(A) the effect of the proposed transaction on the adequacy of transportation to the public.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b385-6\">(B) the effect on the public interest of including, or failing to include, other rail carriers in the area involved in the proposed transaction.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b385-7\">(C) the total fixed charges that result from the proposed transaction.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b385-8\">(D) the interest of carrier employees affected by the proposed transaction.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b385-9\">(E) whether the proposed transaction would have an adverse effect on competition among rail carriers in the affected region.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b385-10\"><em>Id. </em>\u00a7 11,344(b)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b385-11\">2. <em>Congressional Policy on Railroad Mergers</em></p>\n<p id=\"b385-12\">These statutory provisions must be interpreted in light of the longstanding congressional policy favoring railroad mergers that increase efficiency and quality of service. Since 1920, the ICC has operated under \u201cthe congressional policy of encouraging consolidation of the Nation\u2019s railroads.\u201d <em>Penn-Central Merger &amp; N &amp; W Inclusion Cases, </em>389 U.S. 486, 492, 88 S.Ct. 602, 605, 19 L.Ed.2d 723 (1968). The Railroad Revitalization and Regulatory Reform Act of 1976 (\u201c4R Act\u201d), Pub.L. No. 94-210, 90 Stat. 31 (current version in scattered sections of 45, 49 U.S.C.), reinforces that policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-16\">The 4R Act did not alter the substantive \u201cpublic interest\u201d standard for ICC approval of railroad mergers, but did provide new, expedited procedures for ICC review of merger proposals as an alternative to the existing procedures.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> It also declared Congress\u2019 purposes to include:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ahj-dedup-0\">the encouragement of efforts to restructure the [rail] system on a more economically justified basis, including ... an expedited procedure for determining whether merger and consolidation applications are in the public interest.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b385-17\"><em>Id. </em>\u00a7 101(a)(2), 45 U.S.C. \u00a7 801(a)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b385-18\">The Senate committee report explained that the new procedures were needed because \u201c[t]he cumbersome, slow process of ... processing merger proposals ... has drastically slowed change needed in the industry.\u201d S.Rep. No. 499, 94th Cong., 1st Sess. 2-3 (1975), <em>reprinted in </em>1976 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News 14, 16. The committee expected the new procedures to \u201cencourage mergers, consolidations and joint use of facilities that tend to rationalize and improve the Nation\u2019s rail system.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 20, 1976 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News at 34. Similarly, the House expected that the new procedures would permit railroads \u201cto voluntarily rationalize the system in a short period of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>time.\u201d H.R.Rep. No. 725, 94th Cong., 1st Sess. 63 (1975).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b386-4\">The Staggers Rail Act of 1980, Pub.L. No. 96-448, 94 Stat. 1895 (amending 49 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 10,101-11,917), also shows Congress\u2019 endorsement of mergers that enhance railroad efficiency. The Staggers Act did not change the Interstate Commerce Act provisions governing mergers of two or more class I railroads. However, it substantially deregulated the railroad industry in a variety of ways (notably rate-setting practices) and established \u201cthe policy of the United States Government ... to minimize the need for Federal regulatory control over the rail transportation system\u201d and \u201cto foster sound economic conditions in transportation.\u201d 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 10,101a(2), (5).</p>\n<p id=\"b386-5\">B. <em>ICC Railroad Merger Policy</em></p>\n<p id=\"b386-6\">In response to the congressional directives in the 4R Act and the Staggers Rail Act, the ICC has established policy guidelines which favor railroad mergers that improve efficiency and disfavor imposing conditions on a merger that might reduce potential efficiency gains. 49 C.F.R. \u00a7 1180.1 (1982); see <em>Railroad Consolidation Procedures, </em>363 I.C.C. 200 (1981) (statement of basis and purpose).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In general, the Commission \u201cencourages ... rationalization of the nation\u2019s rail facilities and reduction of its excess capacity.\u201d 49 C.F.R. \u00a7 1180.1(a) (1982). In deciding whether a merger is in the public interest, the Commission \u201cperforms a balancing test,\u201d weighing \u201cthe potential benefits to applicants and the public against the potential harm to the public.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1180.1(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b386-15\">In weighing potential harm to the public, the ICC considers two principal factors\u2014 the degree of reduction of competition from a merger and the harm, if any, to \u201cessential services.\u201d In determining whether competition will be significantly reduced, the Commission considers both \u201cintramodal\u201d competition among rail carriers and \u201cinter-modal\u201d competition with trucks, barges, pipelines, and ships. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1180.1(c)(2)(i). The ICC defines rail service as \u201cessential\u201d if \u201cthere is a sufficient public need for the service and adequate alternative transportation is not available.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1180.-l(c)(2)(ii). The Commission does not take into account potential harm to individual competitors (except insofar as harm to competitors significantly reduces competition) because it is concerned only with rail service to the public, \u201cnot the survival of particular carriers.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1180.1(c)(2)(ii).</p>\n<p id=\"b386-16\">The ICC believes that protective conditions are generally not in the public interest because they \u201cmay lessen the benefits of a consolidation to both the carrier and the public.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1180.1(d)(1). It recognizes that competition creates an incentive to provide efficient service and therefore will impose conditions when needed to \u201camelio-rat[e] potential anticompetitive effects of a consolidation.\u201d But it \u201cwill not normally impose conditions\u201d on a merger \u201cto protect a carrier\" unless the conditions are needed to preserve \u201cessential services\u201d and will neither impose \u201cunreasonable\u201d costs on the consolidated carrier nor \u201cfrustrate the ability of the consolidated carrier to obtain the anticipated public benefits.\u201d <em>Id.</em><footnotemark><em>8</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b387-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>C. <em>The Railroads Involved in this Case</em></p>\n<p id=\"b387-5\">Guilford Transportation Industries (Guil-ford) is a holding company that is 100% owned by Timothy Mellon. Guilford owns the Maine Central Railroad, a profitable railroad with a near-monopoly over rail service to the Maine paper and forest products industries.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-6\">The bulk of the traffic carried by the Maine Central originates in Maine and travels west (to Montreal, Buffalo, Chicago, etc.) or south (to Boston, New York, and the mid-Atlantic states); there are also significant shipments of grain from the Midwest to the Maine poultry industry. Rail traffic that originates on the Maine Central can move <em>south </em>over the Boston &amp; Maine Railroad. Traffic from the Maine Central can move <em>west </em>over four routes: over the Canadian National Railway to Montreal and points west; over the Canadian Pacific Railroad to Montreal and points west; over the Lamoille Valley Railroad to the Canadian National to Montreal and points west; and over the Boston &amp; Maine to Albany and from there via Conrail or the Delaware &amp; Hudson Railroad to Buffalo and points west.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-7\">The Canadian National and the Canadian Pacific are large and profitable transcontinental railroads. The Lamoille Valley operates a single 98-mile east-west line between Swanton, Vt. (its western gateway, connecting to the Canadian National) and St. Johnsbury, Vt. (its eastern gateway, connecting to the Maine Central). Only a small volume of traffic originates or terminates on Lamoille Valley\u2019s line. Thus, it depends on \u201coverhead\u201d traffic (carried from the Maine Central over the Lamoille Valley to the Canadian National or vice-versa) for financial viability. Even with its current level of overhead traffic, the Lamoille Valley has been only marginally profitable, and then only because the State of Vermont spent some $16 million during the 1970\u2019s in upgrading Lamoille Valley\u2019s track and equipment.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-10\">The Boston &amp; Maine operates east-west and north-south rail lines in Vermont, New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Connecticut, and New York. It is bankrupt and has been in reorganization since 1970. The Boston &amp; Maine has lost money for the last 25 years; its revenue insufficient to support its extensive network of rail lines.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b387-11\">The Providence &amp; Worcester is a small, profitable railroad serving Rhode Island and Connecticut. It connects primarily with the Boston &amp; Maine and the Canadian National in the north and Conrail in the west.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-12\">D. <em>Proceedings Below</em></p>\n<p id=\"b387-13\">On October 28, 1981, Guilford applied to the ICC for permission to acquire the Boston &amp; Maine. Its plan to make the Boston &amp; Maine profitable depended on three major elements: federal subsidy (in the form of low-interest loans); operating cost savings from merging the Boston &amp; Maine with the Maine Central; and increased revenue from diverting to the Boston &amp; Maine some of the east-west traffic that now travels over the Canadian National, the Canadian Pacific, or the Lamoille Valley.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-14\">1. <em>Conditions Requested by the Boston &amp; Maine\u2019s Competitors</em></p>\n<p id=\"b387-15\">Petitioner Lamoille Valley did not oppose the basic merger. Lamoille Valley claimed, however, that diversion of east-west traffic from it to the Boston &amp; Maine would cause <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>it to go bankrupt. Lamoille Valley therefore sought to obtain a substitute source of revenue by purchasing part of a Boston &amp; Maine line that would carry some of the diverted traffic.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-4\">Petitioner Canadian National <footnotemark>10</footnotemark> also did not oppose the overall merger. It was concerned, however, that Guilford might seek to increase traffic diversion from the Maine Central/Canadian National east-west route to the Maine Central/Boston &amp; Maine route by delaying the interchange of traffic between the Maine Central and the Canadian National. This would reduce the time advantage of the Maine Central/Canadian National route over the Maine Central/Boston &amp; Maine route. Canadian National therefore asked the ICC to require Guilford to maintain current interchange service at Danville and Yarmouth Junctions, Maine.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b388-5\">Petitioner Providence &amp; Worcester is not a direct competitor of the Boston &amp; Maine but rather carries north-south traffic that originates on the Boston &amp; Maine to Connecticut and Rhode Island. Providence &amp; Worcester opposed the merger on the grounds that the merged railroad would not be financially viable and would be unable to maintain current service over those Boston &amp; Maine lines that connect with the Providence &amp; Worcester.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-6\">2. <em>The ICC\u2019s Decision</em></p>\n<p id=\"b388-7\">The ICC approved the merger and denied all requests for protective conditions. It found that the \u201cquintessential public benefit\u201d from the merger was \u201cthe emergence of the [Boston &amp; Maine] from reorganization as part of a potentially strong unified rail network.\u201d <em>Boston &amp; Maine Merger, </em>366 I.C.C. at 336. The Commission also found that \u201c[t]he primary competitive impacts of the [merger] are favorable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 340. There would be no direct reduction of competition because the Boston &amp; Maine and the Maine Central \u201cmeet end-to-end\u201d and \u201cdo not operate any parallel lines.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 341. In addition, the combined Maine Central/Boston &amp; Maine would be a stronger competitor against \u201cthe Canadian lines and Conrail.\u201d <em>Id. .</em></p>\n<p id=\"b388-17\">The ICC further found that the merger would not lead to cessation of essential services. The Commission rejected Canadian National\u2019s request for protective conditions on traffic interchanges at Danville and Yarmouth Junctions for several reasons. In particular, it was not convinced that Guilford intended to delay interchanges. Also, Canadian National\u2019s \u201cratemaking flexibility\u201d gave it \u201csufficient competitive leverage to adequately combat any possible diversions of traffic.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 352.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-18\">As for Lamoille Valley\u2019s request to buy track from the Boston &amp; Maine, the ICC agreed that the diversion of much of Lam-oille Valley\u2019s overhead traffic to the Boston &amp; Maine would be a \u201cdevastating\u201d financial blow to Lamoille Valley. <em>Id. </em>at 353. Nevertheless, it rejected Lamoille Valley\u2019s request because Lamoille Valley\u2019s service was not \u201cessential\u201d \u2014 shippers could use truck transportation instead. While truck transportation was more expensive than rail transportation, it was not so expensive that shippers would be \u201cforced out of business.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b388-19\">E. <em>Issues Presented</em></p>\n<p id=\"A2b\">Lamoille Valley, supported by intervenors Eastern Magnesia Talc Co. (a shipper that uses the Lamoille Valley) and State of Vermont, claims that the ICC\u2019s test for whether a rail line provides \u201cessential services\u201d\u2014 will shippers go out of business if the line shuts down \u2014 is too strict and does not comport with the statutory directive that the ICC consider \u201cadequacy of transportation to the public.\u201d 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 11,344(b)(1)(A). Lamoille Valley also claims that the Corn-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>mission erred in not requiring Timothy Mellon, the sole owner of Guilford, to join the merger application and in failing to consider the interests of Lamoille Valley employees who may lose their jobs as a result of the merger.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-5\">Canadian National joins Lamoille Valley in arguing that the ICC\u2019s essential services test is too strict. It also charges that the Commission misanalyzed both Guilford\u2019s incentive to delay interchanges at Danville and Yarmouth Junctions and the effect of such an action on Canadian National\u2019s willingness to remain in competition with the Boston &amp; Maine. Finally, Canadian National argues that the expedited procedural schedule used by the ICC in considering the merger was a \u201crule\u201d within the meaning of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), 5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 551(4), 553, and was improperly issued without notice and comment.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-6\">Providence &amp; Worcester joins Lamoille Valley in objecting to the ICC\u2019s failure to require Timothy Mellon to join the control application. In addition, it objects to the Commission\u2019s finding that the Boston &amp; Maine would be financially viable after the merger. Finally, Providence &amp; Worcester raises several procedural objections: the ICC improperly failed to exercise jurisdiction over Guilford\u2019s issuance of securities to Timothy Mellon in connection with the merger; the ICC erred in approving Guilford\u2019s acquisition of the Vermont &amp; Massachusetts Co. (which owns a single 56-mile long rail line leased by the Boston &amp; Maine under a 999-year lease) without requiring a formal control application; and the ICC allowed Guilford prematurely to control the Boston &amp; Maine.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b389-7\">Intervenors Guilford and Trustees of the Boston &amp; Maine support the ICC\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-9\">In part II of this opinion, we defer, under principles of equitable abstention, to the reorganization court\u2019s finding that the merged Boston &amp; Maine will be financially viable, and conclude that the ICC properly approved the merger as a whole. In part III, we find that the ICC\u2019s \u201cessential services\u201d test for determining when protective conditions may be needed, <em>on its face, </em>complies with the statute. Nevertheless, we find that the test, <em>as applied </em>to Lamoille Valley, is too strict. In part IV, we find that the ICC failed adequately to explain why Guilford would not downgrade service at Danville and Yarmouth Junctions and that the Commission placed undue weight on Canadian National\u2019s system-wide revenues in assessing Canadian National\u2019s willingness to provide service to Maine. In part V, we conclude that the ICC properly declined to take into account the interests of Lamoille Valley\u2019s employees in continued employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-10\">Part VI deals with the procedural issues. We conclude that the ICC\u2019s failure to require Timothy Mellon to join the merger application, if error, is not prejudicial in this ease. We further conclude that the expedited procedural schedule used by the ICC is exempt from the APA\u2019s notice and comment requirements as a \u201crule[ ] of agency ... procedure,\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 553(b)(A), and that Providence &amp; Worcester\u2019s various procedural objections are without merit. Part VII is a conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-11\">II. The Financial Viability of the Boston &amp; Maine</p>\n<p id=\"b389-12\">The ICC has a statutory responsibility to decide both whether the merger of the Maine Central with the Boston &amp; Maine is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>\u201cconsistent with the public interest\u201d under the Interstate Commerce Act, 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 11,344(c), and whether the reorganization of the Boston &amp; Maine is \u201ccompatible with the public interest\u201d under Bankruptcy Act \u00a7 77(d), 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 205(d) (1976) (current version at 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1172). As part of its \u201cpublic interest\u201d determination under the Bankruptcy Act, the Commission found that the merged Boston &amp; Maine would be financially viable. <em>Boston &amp; Maine Merger, </em>366 I.C.C. at 310-13. Finding that the other requirements of Bankruptcy Act \u00a7 77 were also satisfied, the Commission certified the reorganization plan to the reorganization court. <em>Id. </em>at 318. The reorganization court agreed that the merged Boston &amp; Maine would be viable and approved the plan. <em>In re Boston &amp; Maine Corp., </em>No. 70-250-M, mem. op. at 33-42 (D.Mass. opinion issued Feb. 23, 1983), <em>appeal filed, </em>No. 83-1086 (1st Cir. Feb. 3, 1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b390-4\">In considering whether the merger was \u201cconsistent with the public interest\u201d under Interstate Commerce Act \u00a7 11,344(c), the ICC saw \u201cno need to repeat\u201d its analysis of the viability of the reorganization plan. Relying on that analysis, the Commission again found that the merged Boston &amp; Maine would be financially viable. <em>Boston &amp; Maine Merger, </em>366 I.C.C. at 339.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-5\">Providence &amp; Worcester claims that the ICC wrongly decided that the reorganized and merged Boston &amp; Maine would be financially viable.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The ICC and the Boston &amp; Maine Trustees respond that we lack jurisdiction to review the Commission\u2019s finding of viability because review of that finding lies exclusively in the reorganization court.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> We agree with this response, though we would characterize the issue as one of equitable abstention rather than lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-6\">The <em>New Haven Inclusion Cases, </em>399 U.S. 392, 419-30, 90 S.Ct. 2054, 2072, 2077-2078, 26 L.Ed.2d 691 (1970), involved a situation similar to this one. The ICC had approved the merger of the bankrupt New Haven Railroad with the Penn Central Railroad. The parties appealed the Commission\u2019s valuation of the New Haven\u2019s assets both to a three-judge district court with jurisdiction to review the ICC\u2019s approval of the merger and to the reorganization court charged with reviewing the New Haven\u2019s reorganization plan. The two courts reached conflicting valuations. The Supreme Court held that the three-judge district court, although it had jurisdiction \u201cin a technical sense,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 427, 90 S.Ct. at 2076 should have \u201cstayed its hand\" and permitted the reorganization court to decide the valuation question, <em>id. </em>at 428, 90 S.Ct. at 2076-2077.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-10\">We think abstention is likewise called for here. To be sure, in the <em>New Haven Inclusion Cases, </em>valuation was the sole issue still to be decided, so that the two courts were considering \u201cidentical issues.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 428, 90 S.Ct. at 2076-2077. Here, in contrast, we must decide numerous issues under the Interstate Commerce Act that were not and could not have been presented to the reorganization court. But the policy considerations that led the Court to order abstention in the <em>New Haven Inclusion Cases </em>also counsel abstention here.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-11\">First, the standard for determining financial viability is the same under the Bankruptcy Act and the Interstate Commerce Act. Thus, there is \u201cno danger that application of [Bankruptcy Act \u00a7 77] would yield results different from those to be produced by [Interstate Commerce Act \u00a7 11,344(c) ].\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 424, 90 S.Ct. at 2075. Second, for this court to decide an issue that the reorganization court must also decide \u201c \u2018would tend greatly to foment conflicts between coordinate courts and compel creditors, in the protection of their interests, to ride the circuit, demonstrating the basis of their positions in successive courts.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 427, 90 S.Ct. at 2076 (quoting <em>In re New York, N.H. &amp; H.R. Co., </em>26 F.Supp. 18, 23 (D.Conn.), <em>aff\u2019d sub nom. Palmer v. Warren, </em>108 F.2d 164 (2d Cir.1939), <em>aff\u2019d, </em>310 U.S. 132, 60 S.Ct. 865, 84 L.Ed. 1118 (1940)).</p>\n<p id=\"b391-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>Third, Providence &amp; Worcester has already had a full opportunity to present its arguments to the reorganization court, which rejected them. Thus, it cannot complain of unfairness because we do not give it a second bite at the apple. <em>Cf. id. </em>399 U.S. at 428 n. 57, 90 S.Ct. at 2077 (\u201cAt no time has anyone questioned Penn Central\u2019s status as a party litigant in the reorganization court or challenged its right to make a full presentation of its case there .... \u201d).<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b391-4\">Finally, the major policy reason counseling against abstention \u2014 \u201cthe importance of an expedited determination of the merits,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 424, 90 S.Ct. at 2074 \u2014 is not a factor in this case since the reorganization court has already issued its decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-5\">For the foregoing reasons, we defer to the reorganization court\u2019s conclusion that the ICC properly found that the merged Boston &amp; Maine would be financially viable. The parties raise no other objection to the substantive basis for the ICC\u2019s approval of the merger as a whole, and we find in part VI <em>infra </em>no basis for reversing the Commission on procedural grounds. We therefore affirm the Commission\u2019s decision that the merger is \u201cconsistent with the public interest.\u201d 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 11.344(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b391-6\">III. Lamoille Valley\u2019s Request for Protective Conditions</p>\n<p id=\"b391-7\">A. <em>Standard of Review</em></p>\n<p id=\"b391-8\">The standard of review for the ICC\u2019s decision is well established. The Commission\u2019s interpretation of its governing statute, like that of any regulatory agency, is \u201centitled to deference.\u201d <em>Federal Election Commission v. Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, </em>454 U.S. 27, 32, 102 S.Ct. 38, 42, 70 L.Ed.2d 23 (1981). We must accept the Commission\u2019s interpretation if it is \u201csufficiently reasonable,\u201d even if it is not \u201cthe only reasonable one or even the reading the court would have reached\u201d on its own. <em>Id. </em>at 39,102 S.Ct. at 46; <em>see National Wildlife Federation v. Gorsuch, </em>693 F.2d 156, 166-71 (D.C.Cir.1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b391-11\">The ICC\u2019s substantive conclusions are subject to review under the \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d test of the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706(2)(E). <em>See Illinois Central Railroad v. Norfolk &amp; Western Railway, </em>385 U.S. 57, 66, 87 S.Ct. 255, 260, 17 L.Ed.2d 162 (1966). Under that test, the Commission\u2019s factual findings must be supported by enough evidence \u201cto justify ... a refusal to direct a verdict\u201d the other way in a case tried to a jury. <em>Id. We </em>also expect that when the facts are uncertain, the agency will \u201cso state and go on to identify the considerations [it] found persuasive.\u201d <em>Industrial Union Department, AFL-CIO v. Hodgson, </em>499 F.2d 467, 476 (D.C.Cir.1974). Moreover, the Commission must \u201cconsider[ ] the relevant factors and articulate[] a rational connection between the facts found and the choice made.\u201d <em>Baltimore Gas &amp; Electric Co. v.

Beyond that, however, \u201c[i]t is not for the court to strike down conclusions that are reasonably drawn from the evidence and findings in the case.\u201d <em>Illinois Central, </em>385 U.S. at 69, 87 S.Ct. at 262; <em>see </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number><em>Seaboard Coast Line Railroad v. United States, </em>599 F.2d 650, 652 (5th Cir.1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b392-4\">B. <em>The ICC\u2019s Decision</em></p>\n<p id=\"b392-5\">The Lamoille Valley operates a single 98-mile-long east-west line between St. Johnsbury, Vt. in the east (where it connects with the Maine Central) and Swanton, Vt. in the west (where it connects with the Canadian National). It depends for financial viability on \u201coverhead\u201d traffic which it carries from the Maine Central to the Canadian National or vice-versa. The merger of the Maine Central with the Boston &amp; Maine gives Guilford an incentive to divert traffic from the Maine Central/Lamoille Valley/Canadian National line to the competing Maine Central/Boston &amp; Maine line.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b392-6\">Guilford estimated that its diversion efforts would reduce Lamoille Valley\u2019s gross revenues by about $180,000, based on 1980 traffic data. <em>See Boston &amp; Maine Merger </em>app. C, 366 I.C.C. at 370. Lamoille Valley challenged Guilford\u2019s assumptions and counterestimated traffic diversion of as much as $300,000.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> The ICC found flaws in Guilford\u2019s analysis and concluded that Guilford\u2019s diversion estimates \u2014 both for the Lamoille Valley and for other carriers\u2014 \u201care understated and can be considered as bare minimum estimates of traffic and revenue diversions.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 372.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-7\">For the Lamoille Valley, the ICC found it unnecessary to make its own estimate of traffic diversion. It concluded that \u201c[e]ven using [Guilford\u2019s] figures, which we have found to be minimum estimates, [Lamoille Valley] stands to lose .. . over 15 percent of its 1980 gross revenue. Such a financial blow would be devastating to [Lamoille Valley].\u2019\u2019 <em>Id. </em>at 353.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-8\">Despite this bleak outlook, the ICC denied Lamoille Valley\u2019s request for protec-five conditions because Lamoille Valley\u2019s services were not \u201cessential.\u201d Lamoille Valley\u2019s overhead service was not essential \u201csince a number of other connections to the Canadian routes exist.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 354. Moreover, trucks could substitute for Lamoille Valley\u2019s local service. While truck service would undeniably cost more, shippers sometimes used trucks even now and no shippers would be \u201cforced out of business\u201d if they had to rely exclusively on trucks:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AOs\">Even assuming that ... there would be a cessation of operations, we cannot conclude that essential services would be affected. It appears from the evidence presented by shippers ... that they can be served by motor carriers. All three supporting shippers ... are either presently being served in part, or have been served previously, by truck.... While motor carrier service is more costly, it is a reasonably adequate substitute for [rail] service. None of the supporting shippers has indicated that it would be forced out of business if [Lamoille Valley] discontinued service.<footnotemark>43</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b392-13\"><em>Id. </em>at 353.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-14\">Relying on this passage, Lamoille Valley asserts that the Commission used a \u201cbusiness termination\u201d test to determine if Lam-oille Valley\u2019s local service was \u201cessential,\u201d and that this test does not comply with the statutory directive that the ICC consider \u201cadequacy\u201d of transportation. 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 11,344(b)(1)(A).<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Lamoille Valley also claims that the ICC failed to analyze the reduction in competition for east-west traffic from the Lamoille Valley going out of business. ICC counsel replies that the Commission, in finding that Lamoille Valley\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>services were not \u201cessential,\u201d relied solely on the fact that the shippers were now or recently had been served by truck. Counsel asserts that the Commission has \u201cnever adopted or recommended\u201d a business termination test and that the Commission\u2019s reference to shippers being \u201cforced out of business\u201d was mere dictum.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> As for possible reduction in competition from the Lamoille Valley going out of business, the Commission evaluated it and found it to be negligible.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-5\">C. <em>The Essential Services Test</em></p>\n<p id=\"Aal\">The ICC\u2019s policy statement on railroad mergers explains that there are \u201ctwo potential results from consolidations which would ill serve the public \u2014 reduction of competition and harm to essential services.\u201d 49 C.F.R. \u00a7 1180.1(c)(2) (1982). The Commission defines \u201cessential services\u201d as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b393-6\">A service is essential if there is a sufficient public need for the service and adequate alternative transportation is not available.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b393-7\">Id. \u00a7 1180.1(c)(2)(ii). The ICC treats the existence of harm to competition or to essential services as a <em>threshold </em>test for when conditions <em>may </em>be needed to reduce the adverse effects of a merger. It will never impose protective conditions unless a merger will cause significant reduction in competition or harm to essential services. If a merger will reduce competition or harm essential services, the Commission will decide whether conditions are desirable by balancing the costs and benefits of imposing conditions. This subsection considers the ICC\u2019s use of conditions to protect essential services; subsection D considers the ICC\u2019s use of conditions to preserve competition.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-12\">In general, the ICC\u2019s use of the \u201cessential services\u201d test as a threshold test for when protective conditions deserve further consideration is unobjectionable. Leaving aside the requirement \u2014 not at issue in this case<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> \u2014 of a. \u201csufficient public need,\u201d the ICC defines an \u201cessential service\u201d as one for which an \u201cadequate alternative ... is not available.\u201d This definition simply restates the statutory requirement that the ICC consider \u201cadequacy of transportation to the public.\u201d 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 11,344(b)(1)(A).<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> <em>Accord Brotherhood of Maintenance of Way </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number><em>Employees v. ICC, </em>698 F.2d 315, 319 n. 14 (7th Cir.1983) (\u201cEssential services are basically those the deprivation of which would result in inadequate service to the public.\u201d); <em>of. Missouri-Kansas-Texas Railroad v. United States, </em>632 F.2d 392, 400-04 (5th Cir. 1980) (approving the ICC\u2019s use of an earlier definition of \u201cessential services\u201d), <em>cert, denied, </em>451 U.S. 1017, 101 S.Ct. 3004, 69 L.Ed.2d 388 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b394-4\">It remains to consider whether the ICC properly applied the essential services test to Lamoille Valley. The ICC gave three reasons for concluding that there were adequate alternatives to Lamoille Valley\u2019s rail service. First, all three shippers who testified in favor of Lamoille Valley\u2019s request for protective conditions \u201care either presently being served in part, or have been served previously, by truck.\u201d Furthermore, one shipper, E.T. &amp; H.K. Ide Co., \u201chas access to [Canadian Pacific] rail in St. Johns-bury, [Vt.]\u201d Finally, no shipper claimed that \u201cit would be forced out of business if [Lamoille Valley] discontinued service.\u201d <em>Boston &amp; Maine Merger, </em>366 I.C.C. at 353.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-5\">1. <em>Current or Past Truck Service</em></p>\n<p id=\"b394-6\">The Commission\u2019s first reason for believing that Lamoille Valley\u2019s service is not essential has some probative force. It is plausible that a shipper formerly served by truck can again use trucks and that a shipper now served partially by truck can adequately be served entirely by truck. We must still determine, however, whether the record supports the Commission\u2019s belief that the individual shippers now served by the Lamoille Valley can be adequately served by truck.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-7\">We pass quickly over the one shipper, E.T. &amp; H.K. Ide Co., which has access to Canadian Pacific\u2019s rail service, for that service is surely an adequate substitute for Lamoille Valley\u2019s service. For a second shipper, Lamoille Grain, the record shows that the price difference between rail and truck service is small. Indeed, as recently as 1980, Lamoille Grain switched from rail to truck because truck rates were slightly lower. It switched back only after Lamoille Valley reduced its rates to make them competitive with truck rates.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> Thus, Lamoille Grain can be served adequately by truck.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-11\">The third shipper, Eastern Magnesia Talc Co., presents a much harder case. It operates a talc mine from which it ships talc by truck to some nearby locations and by rail (usually 100-ton hopper cars) to more distant locations. Eastern Magnesia Talc explained to the ICC that the cost of \u201cloading to truck, hauling to a [railhead], unloading, ... and loading to railroad cars\u201d would be \u201cprohibitively expensive\u201d and would effectively prevent it from serving distant locations.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b394-12\">In light of Eastern Magnesia Talc\u2019s un-contradicted statement about the need for rail service for a substantial part of its business, the Commission could not reasonably conclude that because Eastern Magnesia Talc uses trucks for part of its business, trucks are an adequate substitute for rail for the remainder of its business. We turn therefore to the Commission\u2019s alternate reason for concluding that Eastern Magnesia Talc could switch to truck service \u2014 that Eastern Magnesia Talc had not asserted that it would be \u201cforced out of business\u201d if it loses rail service.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-13\">2. <em>Business Termination</em></p>\n<p id=\"b394-14\">As an initial matter, and despite Commission counsel\u2019s denial, it seems clear to us that the ICC is indeed using a \u201cbusiness termination\u201d test to determine whether a substitute for rail service is \u201cadequate.\u201d The ICC\u2019s explanation, though terse, is unambiguous:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>While motor carrier service is more costly, it is a reasonably adequate substitute for [rail] service. None of the supporting shippers has indicated that it would be forced out of business if [Lamoille Valley] discontinued service.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b395-5\"><em>Boston &amp; Maine Merger, </em>366 I.C.C. at 353 (footnote omitted). Similarly, in approving Guilford\u2019s acquisition of the Delaware &amp; Hudson, the ICC explained that the north-south service provided by Canadian National was not essential because, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ay1\">Nowhere in the record has it been shown that any of [its] customers would go out of business if [Canadian National\u2019s] rail service would be terminated.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b395-6\"><em>Delaware &amp; Hudson Merger, supra </em>note 1, 366 I.C.C. at 420. The ICC has used similar phraseology in several recent cases approving abandonment of rail service. <em>See, e.g., Missouri Pacific Railroad </em>\u2014 Abandonment\u2014 <em>Between Port Barre &amp; Jefferson Island, </em>Docket No. AB-3 (Sub-No. 27), slip op. at 5 (July 21, 1982) (not printed) (protesting shipper did \u201cnot contend that the loss of rail service would put it out of business\u201d).<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b395-7\">We can find no justification in the statute for use of a \u201cbusiness termination\u201d test to determine whether alternative service is adequate, and indeed neither the ICC nor Guilford offers any.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> The legislative history does not explain what Congress meant when it instructed the ICC to consider \u201cadequacy of transportation to the public.\u201d<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> Thus, we must give the word \u201cadequate\u201d its ordinary meaning.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-11\">A refusal to consider protective conditions unless alternative service is so expensive that shippers will be forced out of business does not comport with the statutory directive to take into account \u201cadequacy\u201d of transportation. The term \u201cadequate,\u201d as the Supreme Court noted long ago in a similar context, is \u201ca relative expression.\u201d <em>Atlantic Coast Line Railroad v. Wharton, </em>207 U.S. 328, 335 (1907). For a shipper, loss of a service that it currently uses generally portends <em>some </em>decrease in profit, which can be anywhere from minor to devastating. If the additional cost involved in using an alternative service is small, the ICC need not be concerned. At the other extreme, if the added cost is so grave as to force bankruptcy, the alternate service is clearly inadequate, at least for that shipper. Somewhere between these two extremes, we pass from adequate to inadequate service. Within reason, the Commission has discretion to draw the dividing line as it sees fit. The business termination test, however, is too far to one extreme to be a reasonable definition of \u201cadequacy.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b395-12\">In seeking on remand to draw a better line, the Commission should inquire into how much more costly a proposed alternative is and whether loss of existing service will cause substantial harm to the local economy or to shippers who now use that service. With regard to individual shippers, if a shipper can use alternate service and still earn a fair return on capital, sufficient to generally maintain current operations and justify reinvestment of earnings, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>alternate service would seem adequate. The same is true if the shipper can switch production to another plant without serious harm to the local economy. On the other hand, if a shipper cannot earn a fair return, or can do so only by sharply curtailing operations, the Commission probably ought to inquire further into the desirability of protective conditions. It is worth stressing that the essential services test is not a test for <em>imposing </em>conditions, but a test for when it is worthwhile to <em>consider </em>doing so. The ICC may do well, in close cases, to err on the side of reaching the merits of the underlying question whether protective conditions are in the public interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-4\">Sometimes, the profitability of individual shippers may be hard to assess, or a railroad may serve a large number of small shippers, insignificant individually but important in aggregate. The Commission may then want to consider whether most shippers in a particular industry rely on rail service. If not, that suggests that alternate transportation is probably an adequate substitute for shippers in that industry. If most shippers do rely on rail service, then alternate service is probably not an adequate substitute.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-5\">The Commission will also need to assess the importance of individual shippers. If the major shipper or shippers on a rail line can switch to truck, the Commission can reasonably find that truck service is adequate even if a few minor shippers cannot switch. Conversely, alternate service may be inadequate if a major shipper whose facility is important to the local economy cannot switch, even if most shippers can use the alternate service. Again, we urge the Commission, in cases of doubt, to proceed beyond the threshold \u201cessential services\u201d stage of its inquiry.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-8\">We note that our interpretation of \u201cadequacy\u201d of alternative transportation as meaning more than just not going out of business is consistent with past ICC interpretations. While there is no useful case law involving protective conditions for mergers (until recently, the ICC imposed a set of standard conditions on virtually every rail merger<footnotemark>27</footnotemark>), abandonment cases provide a close analogy.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> The abandonment cases do not define \u201cadequacy,\u201d but they do show that the ICC, in determining the public need for rail service, has inquired into the relative costs of rail and truck service. For example, in <em>Northwestern Pacific Railroad Abandonment (Portion) Sausalito Branch, </em>312 I.C.C. 783, 789 (1962), the Commission found that abandonment was not warranted even though most of the shippers objecting to the abandonment \u201cuse motortrucks for part of their shipments.\u201d The Commission noted that a distiller \u201cwould be handicapped by the narrowing of the area in which it could purchase raw materials\u201d; a dealer in heavy diesel engines would incur \u201cadded expense\u201d in shipping disassembled <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>engines by truck and assembling them at destination; and a sailboat manufacturer would incur \u201c40 to 50 percent higher [costs]\u201d in shipping sailboats by truck. <em>Id. </em>The Commission did not insist that the affected shippers claim they would be forced out of business by loss of rail service.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b397-5\">Recent court decisions are in accord. <em>See Georgia Public Service Commission v. United States, </em>704 F.2d 538, 545 (11th Cir.1983) (reversing ICC approval of a rail abandonment):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-6\">The uncontroverted testimony ... is that ... the \u201cadditional\u201d transportation costs [of truck service] would be prohibitive .... If the phrase \u201calternative [transportation]\u201d is to have any meaning it must be interpreted to include transportation both logistically and economically feasible.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b397-7\"><em>See also Indiana Sugars, Inc. v. ICC, </em>694 F.2d 1098,1101 (7th Cir.1982) (abandonment would \u201cinflict serious hardships\u201d on sugar company that depended on rail for much of its inbound traffic).</p>\n<p id=\"b397-10\">3. <em>Conclusion</em></p>\n<p id=\"b397-11\">We conclude that the ICC misconstrued its governing statute and failed to justify its belief that Eastern Magnesia Talc can be served adequately by trucks. Therefore, we remand to the ICC to reconsider Eastern Magnesia Talc\u2019s ability to switch to trucks. If Eastern Magnesia Talc cannot switch, the Commission will also need to consider two questions this opinion does not address \u2014 whether the needs of a single shipper make Lamoille Valley\u2019s service essential and, if so, whether the protective conditions sought by Lamoille Valley are in the public interest.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> We order as follows: As discussed in part II <em>supra, </em>the merger as a whole is approved, but the ICC shall expeditiously consider whether it is in the public interest to impose protective conditions in order to preserve the Lamoille Valley\u2019s service.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b397-12\">D. <em>Anticompetitive Effect</em></p>\n<p id=\"b397-13\">In reviewing a merger, the ICC must consider not only adequacy of transportation but also \u201cwhether the proposed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>transaction would have an adverse effect on competition among rail carriers in the affected region.\u201d 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 11,344(b)(1)(E). The ICC found that the Maine Central and the Boston &amp; Maine \u201cdo not operate any parallel lines, but meet end-to-end.\u201d <em>Boston &amp; Maine Merger, </em>366 I.C.C. at 341. Therefore, the merger would not \u201cdirectly reduce\u201d competition, except for a minor impact on shippers in Portland, Maine (where the two rail systems meet). <em>Id. </em>The Commission found that, on the contrary, by strengthening the Boston &amp; Maine, the merger would enhance competition for east-west traffic between the Boston &amp; Maine route and the currently dominant Canadian National and Canadian Pacific routes. <em>Id. </em>at 340-41.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-4\">The Commission recognized that \u201c[a]n end-to-end consolidation may allow the [combined] system to divert traffic from remaining competitors and thereby foreclose their opportunity to compete in the marketplace.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 341 n. 35. It concluded, however, that the possible demise of the Lamoille Valley would have \u201cnegligible\u201d competitive impact because \u201ca number of other connections to the Canadian routes exist.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 354.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-5\">Lamoille Valley asserts that the Maine Central does in fact compete with the Boston &amp; Maine for east-west traffic.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> We agree. Traffic from Maine can travel west over four routes: (1) over the Canadian National (which connects with the Maine Central at Danville and Yarmouth Junctions, Maine) to Montreal and points west; (2) over the Maine Central\u2019s Mountain Division line to St. Johnsbury, Vt., and from there over the Lamoille Valley to the Canadian National to Montreal and points west; (3) over the Maine Central\u2019s Mountain Division line to St. Johnsbury and from there over the Canadian Pacific to Montreal and points west; and (4) over the Boston &amp; Maine to Albany and points west. Thus, the Maine Central\u2019s Mountain Division line competes with the Boston &amp; Maine\u2019s east-west line.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-11\">At present, the Maine Central has an incentive to route traffic over its own long haul (routes 2 and 3), in preference to the Canadian National route or the Boston &amp; Maine route. After the merger, Guilford will prefer to route traffic to its new long haul \u2014 the Boston &amp; Maine route \u2014 in preference to the other three routes. This traffic shift will lead to the Boston &amp; Maine gaining revenue ($3.2 million annually according to Guilford\u2019s traffic study) while the Maine Central loses revenue ($1.9 million annually according to Guilford\u2019s study) due to decreased traffic over its Mountain Division line. <em>See Boston &amp; Maine Merger </em>app. C, 366 I.C.C. at 370. We must therefore reject the ICC\u2019s statement that the Maine Central and the Boston &amp; Maine do not compete with each other.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b398-12\">Nevertheless, we believe that the record supports the ICC\u2019s belief that the \u201cprimary competitive impacts of the [merger] are favorable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 340. The east-west route from Maine to the Midwest is over 1000 miles long. Currently, the Canadian National and the Canadian Pacific are the dominant carriers. The Boston &amp; Maine\u2019s more circuitous route provides minimal competition, especially given the Boston &amp; Maine\u2019s sorry finances and the Maine Central\u2019s incentive to route traffic away from the Boston &amp; Maine and onto its own Mountain Division line and thence to the Canadian carriers. The merger, the ICC found, will permit the Boston &amp; Maine to compete effectively over a large portion of this route. For that benefit, decreased competition over the short distance traversed by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>the Maine Central\u2019s Mountain Division line is a small price to pay.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b399-5\">As for reduction in competition due to the demise of the Lamoille Valley, we note that a large number of competing carriers on a particular route is not an end in and of itself. Rather, competition is valuable because it promotes efficient service. We find reasonable the ICC\u2019s belief that the remaining competition among the Canadian National, the Canadian Pacific, and the Boston &amp; Maine will provide sufficient stimulus for efficient operation of rail lines.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-6\">IV. Canadian National\u2019s Request for Protective Conditions</p>\n<p id=\"au8-dedup-0\">A. <em>The ICC's Decision</em></p>\n<p id=\"AU-\">Canadian National carries freight from Danville and Yarmouth Junctions, Maine (where it connects with the Maine Central) west to Montreal and Chicago. The joint Maine Central/Canadian National line is the fastest route between Maine and Chicago.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-7\">The Canadian National\u2019s time advantage depends on close coordination of schedules and speedy interchange with the Maine Central at Danville and Yarmouth Junctions. Canadian National expressed concern to the ICC that after the merger, Guilford would refuse to cooperate with Canadian National on scheduling and interchanges, thus increasing transit time over the Maine Central/Canadian National route. This would lessen the attractiveness of that route and permit Guilford to divert more traffic to the currently slower Boston &amp; Maine route. Canadian National also claimed that reduced traffic would force it to cut expenses by running fewer trains and reducing track maintenance, which would further increase transit time, which would lead to additional diversion of traffic to the Boston &amp; Maine, which would force Canadian National to reduce service further, and so on in a vicious cycle that ultimately would lead Canadian National to abandon its Grand Trunk Eastern line between Maine and Montreal.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b399-11\">Guilford\u2019s traffic study, which assumed no increase in interchange time at Danville and Yarmouth Junctions, predicted that diversion of east-west traffic to the Boston &amp; Maine would cost Canadian National $2 million in annual revenues. Canadian National counterestimated diversion losses of $8.1 million per year if Guilford did not downgrade the Danville and Yarmouth interchanges and $12.5 million if Guilford did downgrade the interchanges.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-12\">Canadian National asked the ICC to require Guilford to maintain \u201cpresent operating arrangements, schedules of service, [and] blocking and handling of freight traffic interchanged at [Danville and Yar-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>mouth] junctions.\u201d <em>Boston &amp; Maine Merger </em>app. B, 366 I.C.C. at 365. It claimed that fast service to Chicago is \u201cessential\u201d to shippers and that these conditions were needed both to preserve that service and to preserve competition for east-west traffic between it and the Boston &amp; Maine.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b400-4\">In response, the ICC gave several reasons for believing that Canadian National\u2019s service would not be adversely affected by the merger. It did not reach the question whether that service is essential, nor did it discuss whether loss of the Canadian National\u2019s Grand Trunk Eastern line would significantly reduce competition for east-west traffic.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-5\">First, the ICC explained that Canadian National would not have to abandon its Grand Trunk Eastern line because even Canadian National\u2019s \u201cworst-case scenario\u201d of $12.5 million diversion \u201crepresent[s] a mere fraction of 1 percent of CN\u2019s 1980 gross freight revenue.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 352.<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> Second, there was \u201cno indication in the record that [Guilford] has any intention of downgrading this interchange relationship.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Third, Guilford would not have an incentive to downgrade \u201csince substantial traffic through these interchanges is nondiverti-ble.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Finally, Canadian National \u201cpossesses sufficient competitive leverage to adequately combat any possible diversions of traffic\u201d by virtue of its \u201csingle-line system between [Maine and the midwest] and the ratemaking flexibility inherent in such a system.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b400-9\">We have substantial difficulties with each of these arguments. Cumulatively, the weaknesses in the ICC\u2019s arguments lead us to remand to the Commission to reconsider whether Canadian National\u2019s service will be adversely affected by the merger and, if so, whether the public interest would be advanced by restricting Guilford\u2019s ability to downgrade its interchanges with Canadian National.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-10\">B. <em>The Limited Relevance of Systemwide Revenues</em></p>\n<p id=\"b400-11\">We consider first the ICC\u2019s belief that essential services would not be affected because the diversions from the Canadian National to the Boston &amp; Maine represent a fraction of 1% of Canadian National\u2019s gross revenues and thus, presumably, Canadian National could underwrite any losses on its Grand Trunk Eastern line. We fail to see the relevance of Canadian National\u2019s system-wide revenues.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-12\">First, if Guilford downgrades interchanges at Danville and Yarmouth Junctions, shippers will lose the benefits of \u201cthe best transit time between Maine and the Midwest.\u201d <em>Boston &amp; Maine Merger, </em>366 I.C.C. at 352. Canadian National\u2019s ability to ab<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>sorb the resulting revenue loss will not change that fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-5\">Second, the ICC\u2019s emphasis on Canadian National\u2019s financial strength and neglect of the profitability of the Grand Trunk Eastern line ignores Canadian National\u2019s incentive to maximize profits by shedding money-losing operations. Nothing in the record supports the implausible proposition that Canadian National will indefinitely subsidize losses on its Grand Trunk Eastern line. On the contrary, undisputed testimony from Canadian National\u2019s President establishes that Canadian National treats its branches and subsidiaries as independent \u201cprofit centers\u201d and will not subsidize a losing branch line.<footnotemark>38</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b401-6\">Third, the ICC itself, as a policy matter, opposes on efficiency grounds the subsidizing of money-losing lines. For example, the Commission will not \u201cunder any circumstances\u201d require one carrier to indemnify another carrier for losses due to traffic diversion, because \u201c[t]his transfer of funds would, in effect, be a massive cross-subsidization ... of inefficient operations of another railroad.\u201d <em>Burlington </em>Northern\u2014 <em>Control </em>\u2014 St. <em>Louis-S.F., supra </em>note 37, 360 I.C.C. at 952-53.<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> Similarly, in abandonment proceedings, the Commission analyzes primarily the profitability of the line sought to be abandoned and gives little weight to the profitability of the parent railroad. <em>See, eg., Illinois Central Gulf Railroad Abandonment Between Herscher &amp; Barnes, </em>363 I.C.C. 690, 703 (1980) (\u201cUnprofitable operations ... burden [the carrier] and interstate commerce ... [and the carrier] should not be required to continue [such] operations ..., regardless of whether it is financially capable of doing so .... \u201d), <em>aff\u2019d sub nom. Bloomer Shippers Association v. ICC, </em>679 F.2d 668 (7th Cir.1982).<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> The ICC, to be true to this policy, should not expect Canadian National to operate an inefficient, money-losing line.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-13\">In sum, the ICC\u2019s belief that Canadian National\u2019s overall profitability would permit Canadian National to preserve existing service on its Grand Trunk Eastern line ignores Guilford\u2019s unilateral ability to downgrade interchange service, is unsupported by evidence in the record, and is contrary to Commission policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-14\">This is not to say that Canadian National\u2019s Grand Trunk Eastern line will be unprofitable once the Maine Central merges with the Boston &amp; Maine. Canadian National asserts that the Grand Trunk Eastern line will sustain heavy losses as a result of diversion of traffic to the Boston &amp; Maine,<footnotemark>41</footnotemark> but Guilford disputes this.<footnotemark>42</footnotemark> On remand, the ICC will have an opportunity to decide this factual question.<footnotemark>43</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b401-15\">C. <em>Guilford\u2019s Intent to Maintain Present Service</em></p>\n<p id=\"b401-16\">A second major factor leading the ICC to conclude that the merger would not affect Canadian National\u2019s service was that the record gave \u201cno indication\u201d that Guilford <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>intended to downgrade service at the Dan-ville and Yarmouth interchanges. 366 I.C.C. at 352. We think this factor is entitled to little if any weight.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-4\">First, the record shows only that Guilford has no <em>present </em>intent to downgrade interchange service. Guilford made no promises concerning the future. Thus, Guilford\u2019s owner, Mr. Mellon, when asked if he would \u201cgive Guilford\u2019s assurance\u201d that it would preserve service at Danville and Yarmouth Junctions, gave an equivocal answer \u2014 \u201c[i]f the economic circumstances are somewhat what they are today.\u201d<footnotemark>44</footnotemark> Moreover, Guil-ford opposed Canadian National\u2019s request for conditions, thus reserving for itself the right to decrease service in the future.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-5\">Second, as the Commission itself has recently recognized, self-serving statements by a merging railroad\u2019s officers are entitled to little credence. <em>See Norfolk &amp; Western </em>\u2014 Control\u2014Detroit, <em>Toledo &amp; Iron-ton, supra </em>note 27, 360 I.C.C. at 512 (promise by two competing railroads to operate independently a third competing line is \u201cself-serving and must be examined closely .... It is difficult to expect sacrificial behavior from profit seeking corporations into the indefinite future.\u201d). Guilford will, we expect, seek to maximize profits. If it can profitably downgrade interchanges with Canadian National, Guilford will have strong incentives to do so, notwithstanding its current disclaimers. Thus, Guilford\u2019s actual financial incentives, not its professed intent, must be the dominant concern. We consider those incentives next.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-6\">D. <em>Guilford\u2019s Incentives to Downgrade Interchange Service</em></p>\n<p id=\"b402-7\">The ICC\u2019s third reason for rejecting protective conditions at Danville and Yar-mouth Junctions was that \u201cit would not appear to be to [Guilford\u2019s] benefit for such deterioration [of interchange service] to take place, since substantial traffic through those interchanges is nondivertable.\u201d <em>Boston &amp; Maine Merger, </em>366 I.C.C. at 352.<footnotemark>45</footnotemark> We think that the Commission failed to analyze properly Guilford\u2019s incentives to downgrade interchange service.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-11\">1. <em>Guilford\u2019s Incentives in Antitrust Theory</em></p>\n<p id=\"b402-12\">The Maine Central is the only railroad providing east-west service to the Maine paper industry. Moreover, Canadian National claims, and the Commission does not dispute, that most of the Maine Central\u2019s traffic is captive to rail \u2014 trucks are not a significant source of competition.<footnotemark>46</footnotemark> Thus, the Maine Central has market power over rail traffic to and from Maine. As a theoretical matter, then, the Maine Central may be able to increase profits by altering its interchange service.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-13\">The merger of the Maine Central with the Boston &amp; Maine is, in antitrust terminology, a \u201cvertical\u201d merger. Ordinarily, a vertically integrated monopolist has no incentive to use its monopoly power over one level of production (rail service in Maine) to increase profits at another level (rail service from Maine to the midwest). As the leading treatise puts it, \u201cthere is but one maximum monopoly profit to be gained\u201d from a monopoly of one level of production, and that profit may be gained directly at the monopolized level (here, rail service in Maine) through appropriate pricing. 3 P. Areeda &amp; D. Turner, <em>Antitrust Law </em>\u00a7 725b (1978). There is an exception to this rule, however, for a regulated monopolist, which may be able to obtain from a second level of production \u201cthe monopoly profits which effective regulation of the franchised monopoly precludes.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00b6 726e (footnote omitted).<footnotemark>47</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b403-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>The Maine Central is, of course, a regulated monopolist. It is barred by the ICC from charging a monopoly price for rail service to Maine,<footnotemark>48</footnotemark> but may be able to use its control over service at Danville and Yar-mouth Junctions to shift its potential monopoly profit to the Boston &amp; Maine. Indeed, the ICC itself has recently recognized the risk of such conduct. <em>See Union Pacific </em>\u2014 Control\u2014Missouri <em>Pacific, supra </em>note 21, 366 I.C.C. at 529:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b403-4\">[In an end-to-end merger], the consolidated system may profit by limiting the \u201cdownstream\u201d competition [from connecting carriers] and routing traffic over its own lines from origin to destination. ... This vertical foreclosure effect will occur, if at all, at the gateways served commonly by the consolidating carriers.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b403-5\">We do not know whether Guilford will <em>in fact </em>profit by downgrading interchange service, but the risk is substantial. Indeed, Areeda and Turner believe that the probability that a vertically integrated, regulated monopolist will abuse its market power is \u201cpeculiarly high.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00b6 726e, at 218. They would forbid vertical integration by a regulated monopolist except in cases where regulatory authorities \u201ccan more or less easily exercise the power to prohibit refusals to sell and to specify the price and other terms of sale.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00b6 726e, at 219 (footnote omitted). In this case, the ICC permitted vertical integration but declined to exercise its power to control the \u201cterms of sale\u201d between the Maine Central and the Canadian National. The question is whether that decision was reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-10\">2. <em>Guilford\u2019s Actual Incentives</em></p>\n<p id=\"AM3\">We do not think that the Commission gave Guilford\u2019s possible incentives to downgrade interchange service the scrutiny they deserve. As we understand its terse explanation, the Commission\u2019s conclusion that Guilford has no incentive to downgrade rests on two premises, the first explicit, the second implicit. First, Guilford will continue to transfer substantial amounts of traffic to Canadian National at Danville and Yarmouth Junctions. Second, if Guilford downgrades interchange service, it will earn less profit on nondivertible traffic.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-11\">The first premise is undisputed in the record, though Guilford and Canadian National disagree on how much traffic will be diverted.<footnotemark>49</footnotemark> There is no record evidence regarding the second premise. The premise is plausible, if only because reduced service will lead some shippers to switch to trucks or produce fewer goods. But the magnitude of this effect is uncertain and may well be small. Little traffic will be lost to trucks because, for most of the Maine Central\u2019s shippers, trucks are not a feasible alternative to rail. And the record is silent on how much business Maine producers will lose to competitors elsewhere in the country if they lose fast service to the midwest.<footnotemark>50</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b403-12\">The Commission not only failed to quantify Guilford\u2019s costs from downgrading interchange service at Danville and Yarmouth Junctions, it also ignored the benefits to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>Guilford from increased diversion. The Commission does not dispute that some additional diversion will occur. We can only speculate as to the amount of diversion and how profitable the diverted traffic will be to Guilford.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-4\">Without quantifying the costs or even discussing the benefits to Guilford from downgrading interchange service, the ICC could not rationally conclude that Guilford will not have an incentive to downgrade. On remand, the Commission must ascertain more carefully where Guilford\u2019s incentives actually lie.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-5\">We do not suggest that the Commission will be able to predict Guilford\u2019s future behavior with absolute accuracy. Rather, Guilford\u2019s incentives or disincentives to downgrade will be \u201cprimarily a question of probabilities, and thus peculiarly subject to the expert experience, discretion, and judgment of the Commission.\u201d <em>Missouri-Kansas-Texas Railroad v. ICC, </em>632 F.2d 392,406 (5th Cir.1980), <em>cert. denied, </em>451 U.S. 1017, 101 S.Ct. 3004, 69 L.Ed.2d 388 (1981). But our deference to its ultimate choice does not relieve the Commission of the duty to explain, based on substantial evidence in the record, whether Guilford will or will not have an incentive to downgrade interchange service.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-6\">E. <em>Canadian National\u2019s Competitive Leverage</em></p>\n<p id=\"b404-7\">The ICC\u2019s final reason for believing that Guilford would not downgrade interchange service was Canadian National\u2019s power to take effective opposing steps. The Commission explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b404-8\">[Canadian National (CN) ] possesses sufficient competitive leverage to adequately combat any possible diversions of traffic. The CN-[Maine Central] connection still affords shippers the best transit time between Maine and the Midwest. By virtue of operating a single-line system between these two regions of the country, and the ratemaking flexibility inherent in such a system, CN is able to assert a great deal of influence in the routing of traffic.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b404-11\"><em>Boston &amp; Maine Merger, </em>366 I.C.C. at 352. This reasoning is none too clear, but we understand the Commission to suggest two sources of Canadian National\u2019s \u201ccompetitive leverage.\u201d First, Canadian National\u2019s route is the fastest. Second, Canadian National\u2019s long haul over a single system gives it \u201cratemaking flexibility.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b404-12\">We fail to understand the first claim. That Canadian National can potentially provide the fastest route to the midwest will not do it much good if Guilford unilaterally destroys that advantage. As for \u201cratemaking flexibility,\u201d we are not sure what the Commission means by the term, but we can see two possibilities. First, Canadian National can recoup lost traffic by cutting its prices to shippers. Second, Canadian National can pay Guilford to maintain current interchange service by giving Guilford a larger share of the total Maine-to-midwest freight charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-13\">Price cuts to shippers, however, will not restore the Canadian National\u2019s current fast, efficient service to the midwest. Moreover, price cuts offer scant promise of returning the Grand Trunk Eastern to profitability. In the long run, if the Grand Trunk Eastern loses money, Canadian National will presumably close it down.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-14\">Canadian National may temporarily preserve fast service by giving Guilford a larger share of joint revenues. Such payments, however, can only reduce the Grand Trunk Eastern\u2019s profitability, which in the long run is essential to service of any kind, let alone fast service.<footnotemark>51</footnotemark> We conclude, therefore, that the Commission unreasonably re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>lied on Canadian National\u2019s \u201ccompetitive leverage\u201d to preserve existing service.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-5\">P. <em>Potential Harm from Protective Conditions</em></p>\n<p id=\"b405-6\">Having considered the possible need to preserve interchange service at Danville and Yarmouth Junctions,<footnotemark>52</footnotemark> we turn briefly to the possible harm from imposing protective conditions. Canadian National\u2019s requested conditions, as described by the ICC, were:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b405-7\">[Maine Central] shall preserve and continue at a minimum its practices existing on October 31, 1981 in connection with handling freight traffic over the routes with the Grand Trunk Eastern and at the interchange points at Danville Junction and Yarmouth Junction, ME. Changes in present operating arrangements, schedules of service, blocking and handling of freight traffic interchanged at these junctions shall be made only with the concurrence of Canadian National Railway.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b405-8\"><em>Boston &amp; Maine Merger </em>app. B, 366 I.C.C. at 365. The ICC explained that these conditions were relatively \u201cnarrow in scope\u201d and would have little effect on competition, but would reduce Guilford\u2019s ability to improve service on its own system:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b405-11\">They do not appear to affect rates or diversions [sic], but rather freeze existing practices with respect to operating arrangements, schedules, and the blocking and handling of freight moving over Danville and Yarmouth Junctions in Maine. While the competitive effect of these conditions is not clear, imposition of these conditions would at least reduce [Guilford\u2019s] flexibility in improving the service capabilities on its own system.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AOr\"><em>Id. </em>at 352.<footnotemark>53</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b405-12\">Canadian National urges that its proposed veto over changes in operating arrangements would not \u201cfreeze existing practices.\u201d Canadian National points out that if it used its veto, Guilford could appeal to the Commission, which could grant relief from the condition in a proper case. <em>See Southern Pacific Co. </em>\u2014 Merger\u2014Pacific <em>Electric Railway, </em>354 I.C.C. 100, 109-10 (1977). We see little force to this argument. Guilford would still be burdened by the delay involved in an appeal to the ICC. Thus, as a practical matter, Canadian National\u2019s veto would substantially reduce Guilford\u2019s flexibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-13\">On the other hand, the ICC is not restricted to choosing between Canadian National\u2019s requested conditions and no conditions at all.<footnotemark>54</footnotemark> On the contrary, if the Com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>mission believes that an unconditioned merger would harm the public interest but finds a proposed condition inappropriate, its duty to advance the public interest requires it to devise appropriate conditions, if such conditions can be developed with reasonable effort. <em>See Baltimore &amp; Ohio Railroad v. United States, </em>386 U.S. 372, 430, 87 S.Ct. 1100, 1129, 18 L.Ed.2d 159 (1967) (Brennan, J., concurring) (\u201c[t]he ICC is not the prisoner of the parties\u2019 submissions\u201d and must \u201cweigh alternatives and make its choice according to its judgment how best to achieve [Congress\u2019 policy] goals\u201d) (footnotes omitted); <em>Atlantic Coast Line R. Co. v. United States, </em>48 F.2d 239, 244 (W.D.S.C. 4th Cir. 1931) (3-judge court) (\u201cIt is not only the right but the duty of the commission to impose such conditions as will make the acquisition in the public interest .... \u201d), <em>aff\u2019d, </em>284 U.S. 288, 52 S.Ct. 171, 76 L.Ed. 298 (1932). <em>See also Scenic Hudson Preservation Conference v. FPC, </em>354 F.2d 608, 620-21 (2d Cir.1965), <em>cert, denied, </em>384 U.S. 941, 86 S.Ct. 1462, 16 L.Ed.2d 540 (1966).<footnotemark>55</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b406-4\">The ICC can probably design conditions that will prevent significant deterioration in transit time on the Maine Central/Canadian National route without seriously burdening Guilford. At a minimum, the Commission can require Guilford to give Canadian National advance notice of service changes. It could then permit Guilford to make the changes after an expedited showing to the Commission that the changes will not disrupt joint service with the Canadian National. Alternatively, it could permit the changes unless Canadian National shows that the changes will disrupt its service to the midwest. If appropriate, the Commission can limit the duration of any conditions it imposes.<footnotemark>56</footnotemark> Other possibilities may also occur to the Commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-9\">G. <em>Conclusion</em></p>\n<p id=\"b406-10\">All four of the ICC\u2019s reasons for finding no need to impose protective conditions are seriously flawed. Cumulatively, they show failure by the Commission to \u201cconsider all of the relevant factors and demonstrate a reasonable connection between the facts on the record and the resulting policy choice.\u201d <em>Sierra Club v. Cos-tie, </em>657 F.2d 298, 323 (D.C.Cir.1981) (footnote omitted). We therefore remand to the Commission to reconsider the public benefit from protective conditions, taking into account the factors identified in this opinion.<footnotemark>57</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b407-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>We recognize the complexity of this endeavor. In all likelihood, the probability that Guilford will downgrade interchange service will be greater than zero and less than 100%. The magnitude of public harm from downgrading will be uncertain as well. From these two uncertainties, the Commission will have to compute a rough, perhaps unquantified estimate of expected public benefit from protective conditions, and weigh that benefit against the equally speculative cost of restricting Guilford\u2019s future flexibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-5\">Once that balancing has been done, we will not lightly disturb the Commission\u2019s ultimate conclusion. On the record before us, however, the Commission has both ignored relevant factors and reached conclusions unsupported by substantial evidence in the record. It has not, in short, exercised that modicum of care that would permit us to approve its decision as \u201creasonable.\u201d<footnotemark>58</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b407-6\">V. Labor Protective Conditions</p>\n<p id=\"AVg\">In reviewing a railroad merger, the ICC must consider, as part of its public interest determination, \u201cthe interest of carrier employees affected by the proposed transaction.\u201d 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 11,344(b)(1)(D). Moreover, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 11,347 requires the ICC to protect displaced employees:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b407-7\">When a rail carrier is involved in a transaction for which approval is sought under [\u00a7 11,344], the Interstate Commerce Commission shall require the carrier to provide a fair arrangement ... [for] employees who are affected by the transaction .... Notwithstanding this [Act], the arrangement may be made by the rail carrier and the authorized representative of its employees.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b407-8\">The Commission provided suitable arrangements for Maine Central and Boston &amp; Maine employees. It did not consider the interests of, nor provide protection for, employees of competing railroads who may lose their jobs as a result of traffic diversions. <em>See Boston &amp; Maine Merger, </em>366 I. C.C. at 344. Lamoille Valley asserts that this was error. We affirm the Commission\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7\u00a7 11,344(b)(4) and II, 347 as requiring it to protect only employees of the merging railroads and not employees of other railroads.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-16\">First, the ICC\u2019s interpretation of the language of \u00a7 11,347 is sensible. The second sentence of \u00a7 11,347 provides that \u201cthe arrangement may be made by <em>the rail carrier </em>and the authorized representative of <em>its </em>employees.\u201d (Emphasis added.) The phrase \u201cthe rail carrier\u201d presumably refers back to the preceding sentence and thus includes only \u201ca rail carrier ... involved in the transaction.\u201d But an arrangement between \u201ca rail carrier involved in the transaction\u201d and \u201cits employees\u201d will not protect employees of other carriers. Thus, Congress must not have contemplated protecting employees of nonapplicant railroads. As for \u00a7 11,344(b)(4), it was first enacted at the same time as \u00a7 11,347, and the two sections should be construed <em>in pari materia.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b407-17\">The legislative history of \u00a7 11,347 strongly supports this interpretation. <em>See Missouri-Kansas-Texas Railroad v. United States, </em>632 F.2d 392, 411-12 (5th Cir.1980) (reviewing the legislative history), <em>aff\u2019g Burlington Northern </em>\u2014 Control\u2014St. <em>Louis-S.F., supra </em>note 37, 360 I.C.C. at 948-50, <em>cert. denied, </em>451 U.S. 1017,101 S.Ct. 3004, 69 L.Ed.2d 388 (1981).<footnotemark>59</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b407-18\">Second, while there may be policy reasons for treating all railroad employees alike regardless of their employer, the Commission\u2019s interpretation is supported by considerations of practicality and administrative <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>economy. As the Commission explained in <em>Burlington Northern, </em>360 I.C.C. at 949-50:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ACN\">It is difficult enough to determine which employees of a railroad involved in the transaction have been adversely affected by that transaction. To require a determination that employees of another competing carrier have also been affected by a merger ... would place an impossible burden on the party required to rebut the allegation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b408-4\">Third, the Commission has consistently interpreted \u00a7 11,347, since its original enactment in 1940, to exclude employees of non-applicant railroads.<footnotemark>60</footnotemark> That consistent interpretation is entitled to deference, especially since Congress implicitly approved that interpretation in revising and reenacting \u00a7 11,347 in 1976.<footnotemark>61</footnotemark> <em>See NLRB v. Bell Aerospace Co., </em>416 U.S. 267, 275, 94 S.Ct. 1757,1762, 40 L.Ed.2d 134 (1974) (additional deference to an agency\u2019s statutory interpretation is due \u201cwhere Congress has reenacted the statute without pertinent change\u201d) (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b408-5\">Finally, other courts that have addressed this issue have consistently approved the Commission\u2019s interpretation, including the only court to consider the issue since the 1976 amendments to the Interstate Commerce Act. <em>See Missouri-Kansas-Texas Railroad v. United States, </em>632 F.2d 391, 411-12 (5th Cir.1980) (a thorough opinion on which our own analysis relies heavily), <em>cert. denied, </em>451 U.S. 1017, 101 S.Ct. 3004, 69 L.Ed.2d 388 (1981); <em>Florida East Coast Railway v.

(3-judge court), <em>vacated and remanded per curiam, </em>379 U.S. 199, 85 S.Ct. 307, 13 L.Ed.2d 338 (1964).<footnotemark>62</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b408-10\">VI. Procedural Issues</p>\n<p id=\"b408-11\">A. <em>Must Mr. Mellon Join the Merger Application?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b408-12\">Guilford sought ICC permission to acquire the Boston &amp; Maine under 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 11,343(a)(5), which requires ICC approval for:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b408-13\">acquisition of control of a carrier by a person that is not a carrier but that controls any number of carriers.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b408-14\"><em>Id. </em>\u00a7 11,343(b), in turn, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b408-15\">A person may carry out a transaction referred to in subsection (a) ... only <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>with the approval and authorization of the Commission.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b409-5\">Section 11,343(a)(5) certainly covers Guil-ford, as a \u201cperson\u201d who \u201ccontrols any number of carriers\u201d (Guilford already controlled the Maine Central) and seeks control of another carrier (the Boston &amp; Maine). It also covers Timothy Mellon, the sole owner of Guilford, who also \u201ccontrols\u201d the Maine Central (through Guilford) and seeks to control the Boston &amp; Maine.<footnotemark>63</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b409-6\">The ICC, however, did not require Mr. Mellon to join the control application. The Commission explained that joinder would serve no useful purpose because it already had all the information it needed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b409-7\">[T]he only issue raised by any of the parties over Mr. Mellon\u2019s presence as an applicant concerns an asserted need for disclosure of his personal finances. We agree with the Administrative Law Judge, however, that Mr. Mellon\u2019s personal finances have nothing to do with this transaction. Nor has there been any suggestions of past impropriety on Mr. Mellon\u2019s part or the hint of any likelihood of future abuses. Thus, requiring Mr. Mellon to join as an applicant would be a meaningless gesture that would not advance the statute\u2019s purpose of assuring that the Commission has available to it all information relevant to its determination of the consistency of the proposed transaction with the public interest ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AiY\"><em>Boston &amp; Maine Merger, </em>366 I.C.C. at 325. The Commission conceded that \u201ca literal reading of 49 U.S.C. 11343 and some precedent\u201d suggested that joinder was mandatory, <em>id. </em>at 324, but the Commission believed the statute gave it discretion not to insist on pointless joinder.<footnotemark>64</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b409-13\">Lamoille Valley and Providence &amp; Worcester assert that the joinder provisions are mandatory, not discretionary, and that unless Mr. Mellon joins the control application, the ICC has no authority to approve the merger.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-14\">We are not convinced that the ICC has correctly interpreted \u00a7 11,343. The section speaks in mandatory language \u2014 a person may acquire control of two or more carriers \u201conly\u201d with the ICC\u2019s approval.<footnotemark>65</footnotemark> Moreover, the Commission has for 40 years, until its sudden reversal of position in this case, consistently construed \u00a7 11,343 as mandatory. The Commission\u2019s interpretation was early upheld in <em>United States v. Marshall Transport Co., </em>322 U.S. 31, 64 S.Ct. 899, 88 L.Ed. 1110 (1944). In <em>Marshall Transport, </em>a division of the ICC had approved the purchase of one carrier by a second carrier that was controlled, in turn, by a non-carrier. The full Commission reversed for failure of the non-carrier to join the application. The Supreme Court affirmed the ICC\u2019s view that the Commission was \u201cwithout authority\u201d to approve the transaction. <em>Id. </em>at 42, 64 S.Ct. at 904. Similar reasoning would suggest that Mr. Mellon must join Guilford\u2019s application here<footnotemark>66</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b409-15\">As a policy matter, the Commission\u2019s distaste for pointless joinder has obvious ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>peal. On the other hand, it is hard to see why joinder would cause much harm.<footnotemark>67</footnotemark> Also, mandatory joinder would ensure that the parties fully inform the ICC of the actual chain of control of a carrier. Moreover, the financial status of the ultimate owner will often be relevant to a control application. A financially weak owner may drain funds from a carrier to pay other bills or lack the capital needed to expand to serve new areas.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-4\">A full resolution of this question would require close scrutiny of the legislative history plus consideration of the troublesome question of how much deference, if any, courts should give to an agency\u2019s interpretation of its governing statute when that interpretation overrules a longstanding contrary interpretation. Fortunately, we need not attempt that task here. Had the ICC required Mr. Mellon to join Guilford\u2019s control application, he presumably would have applied for waiver under 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 10,-505(a), which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b410-5\">In a matter related to a rail carrier ... subject to ... this [Act], the Commission <em>shall </em>exempt a person ... when the Commission finds that the application of a provision of this [Act]\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b410-6\">(1) is not necessary to carry out the transportation policy of [49 U.S.C. \u00a7 10,-101a]; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b410-7\">(2) ... is not needed to protect shippers from the abuse of market power.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b410-8\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b410-9\">In light of the ICC\u2019s findings that it had no questions to ask of Mr. Mellon and that joinder would be a \u201cmeaningless gesture,\u201d the Commission would have had to grant waiver under \u00a7 10,505(a). Thus, the Commission\u2019s failure to require joinder, if error, is not \u201cprejudicial error,\u201d <em>see </em>5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706 (last clause), and is not grounds for reversing the Commission\u2019s decision. <em>Accord Delaware &amp; Hudson Merger, supra </em>note 1, 366 I.C.C. at 424-25 (Simmons, Comm\u2019r, concurring).<footnotemark>68</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b410-13\">B. <em>The Expedited Procedural Schedule</em></p>\n<p id=\"b410-14\">As background for Canadian National\u2019s challenge to the ICC\u2019s accelerated timetable for considering the merger of the Maine Central and the Boston &amp; Maine, we review the steps leading up to Guilford\u2019s filing of its application. Guilford tentatively agreed to buy the Boston &amp; Maine on April 15, 1981 and formally agreed to the transaction on July 8, 1981. An amended plan of reorganization reflecting the agreement was filed with the ICC on July 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-15\">Several weeks later, on August 13, 1981, Congress passed the Northeast Rail Service Act of 1981 (NERSA).<footnotemark>69</footnotemark> NERSA \u00a7 1164(a), 45 U.S.C. \u00a7 1112(a), requires the ICC to decide any merger application involving a bankrupt Northeast railroad within 180 days:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b410-16\">[I]n any [merger] proceeding ... involving a [Northeast] railroad . . . which was in a bankruptcy proceeding ... on November 4, 1979, the Commission shall, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>with or without a hearing, issue a final decision within a period not to exceed 180 days after receipt of an application ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ang-dedup-0\">Congress specifically intended this provision to ensure speedy consideration of Guilford\u2019s proposal to acquire the Boston &amp; Maine.<footnotemark>70</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b411-5\">The next day, August 14, 1981, Guilford notified the ICC of its intent to file a control application and requested waiver of the customary 3-month waiting period between notice of intent to file and actual filing. See 49 C.F.R. \u00a7 1180.4(b)(1) (1982) (prefil-ing notice period); <em>id. </em>\u00a7 1180.4(f) (waiver provision). The ICC granted the waiver on September 11, 1981. It explained that waiver would further Congress\u2019 intent, expressed in NERSA \u00a7 1164, that the Commission speedily consider the merger, and that interested parties would not be prejudiced because they should have been aware \u201cfor some time\" of the proposed merger. The ICC further explained that because it had to issue a decision on the merger within 180 days, it could not follow the usual 31-month procedural schedule in 49 C.F.R. \u00a7 1180.4 (1982). It promised to issue an \u201cexpedited procedural schedule\u201d after receiving the application.<footnotemark>71</footnotemark> Guilford filed its application on October 28, 1981, and one week later, on November 4, 1981, the ICC issued the promised 180-day schedule. The schedule gave competing railroads 60 days (instead of the usual 90) to file responsive applications.<footnotemark>72</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b411-6\">Canadian National alleges that the ICC\u2019s actions left it without enough time properly to prepare a responsive application. It argues that the ICC abused its discretion in waiving the 3-month prefiling notice period and that the expedited procedural schedule was a \u201crule\u201d within the meaning of the APA, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 551(4), 553, and was improperly issued without notice and comment.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-11\">At a practical level, we think that the ICC did an admirable job in compressing its procedures into a minimum time without undue prejudice to the parties. Canadian National makes only one concrete suggestion on what the Commission should have done differently \u2014 the Commission should have required an extended prefiling notice period to compensate for the accelerated 180-day post-filing schedule mandated by Congress. That suggestion \u2014 though perhaps technically consistent with NERSA \u00a7 1164 \u2014 runs directly counter to Congress\u2019 intent that the merger be considered quickly-</p>\n<p id=\"b411-12\">Turning to Canadian National\u2019s legal argument, we find no abuse of discretion in the Commission\u2019s decision to compress the proceedings slightly by waiving the 3-month prefiling notice period. The Commission\u2019s explanation for its action is reasonable and consistent with congressional intent. We can ask no more. We also hold that the procedural schedule was exempt from notice and comment requirements as a \u201crule[] of agency procedure.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 553(b)(A).<footnotemark>73</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b412-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>It is clear, at the outset, that the procedural schedule is a \u201crule,\u201d as defined broadly in 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 551(4) to include not only substantive rules but also:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Auz\">the whole or a part of an agency statement of general or particular applicability and future effect ... describing the organization, procedure, or practice requirements of an agency.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b412-4\">The APA\u2019s notice and comment requirements apply, however, only to substantive rules and not to \u201cinterpretative rules, general statements of policy, or rules of agency organization, procedure, or practice.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 553(b)(A). It is hard to characterize the agency statement at issue here as anything other than a rule of \u201cprocedure.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b412-5\">That is not quite the end of the inquiry, for all procedural rules affect substantive rights to greater or lesser degree. Our cases recognize that when an agency rule \u201cjeopardizes the rights and interests of parties ..., it must be subject to public comment,\u201d even if the rule can in some sense be called \u201cprocedural.\u201d <em>Batterton v. Marshall, </em>648 F.2d 694, 708 (D.C.Cir.1980) (footnote omitted). The issue is one of degree\u2014 whether the substantive effect is sufficiently grave so that notice and comment are needed to safeguard the policies underlying the APA.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-6\">In applying this general principle to this case, we begin by noting that the time schedule at issue here is definitely at the procedural end of a spectrum running from \u201cprocedural\u201d to \u201csubstantive.\u201d Thus, we put to one side cases like <em>Batterton </em>where a rule has definite substantive consequences but can arguably be called either \u201cprocedural\u201d or \u201csubstantive,\u201d and a court must decide which it is.<footnotemark>74</footnotemark> When a rule prescribes a timetable for asserting substantive rights, we think the proper question is whether the time allotted is so short as to foreclose effective opportunity to make one\u2019s case on the merits. This standard allows an agency ample discretion to structure its proceedings as it sees fit. However, when an agency abuses that discretion by creating extreme procedural hurdles that foreclose fair consideration of the underlying controversy, a court, by remanding for notice and comment, can ensure that the agency explores the substantive consequences of its \u201cprocedural\u201d rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-12\">We do not think that Canadian National\u2019s ability to file a responsive application was substantially abridged by the Commission\u2019s procedural schedule. The ICC was constrained by Congress to reach a decision within 180 days. It gave competing railroads 75 days to file a responsive application (60 days plus a two-week extension). This allotment \u2014 almost half of the 180 days that Congress gave the ICC to reach a decision, and only a bit less than the 90 days allowed in a normal 31-month merger proceeding \u2014 was more than sufficient to permit Canadian National to develop its response. <em>Accord Banger v.

He neither sought nor obtained ICC approval for these transactions.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-6\">Under 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 11,301(b)(1), a \u201ccarrier\u201d \u2014 defined in <em>id. </em>\u00a7 11,301(a)(1) to include \u201ca corporation organized to provide transportation by rail\u201d \u2014 must obtain ICC approval before issuing securities, and unapproved securities are \u201cvoid.\u201d Providence &amp; Worcester asserts that Guilford, as a holding company created to acquire railroad properties, is a \u201ccarrier\u201d subject to \u00a7 11,301 and that Guilford\u2019s non-approved securities are void. The ICC responds that it lacks jurisdiction to review Guilford\u2019s issuance of securities because Guilford is not a \u201ccarrier\u201d but merely a holding company that owns carriers.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-7\">We uphold the ICC\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7 11,301(b)(1) as not granting it jurisdiction over securities issued by a holding company. Although the Commission very early took a view similar to that now espoused by Providence &amp; Worcester, its current interpretation has not changed since I960.<footnotemark>76</footnotemark> That long-held interpretation is entitled to substantial deference, and we find it \u201csufficiently reasonable to be accepted.\u201d <em>Federal Election Commission v. Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, </em>454 U.S. 27, 39, 102 S.Ct. 38, 46, 70 L.Ed.2d 23 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b413-11\">The language of \u00a7 11,301 does not inexorably command either result. But other provisions of the Act show that Congress understood the difference between a \u201ccarrier\u201d and a holding company that owns a carrier. In particular, 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 11,348 provides that when the ICC approves a merger in which \u201ca person not a carrier\u201d acquires control of two or more carriers, \u201cthe person is subject, as a carrier, to [\u00a7 11,301].\u201d<footnotemark>77</footnotemark> Thus, if Congress had wanted to include holding companies within the ambit of \u00a7 11,301, it knew how to say so. Moreover, the ICC\u2019s construction preserves independent force for \u00a7 11,348. If \u00a7 11,301 covers holding companies that own carriers, \u00a7 11,348 would be surplusage.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-12\">It is true that the ICC\u2019s interpretation permits a carrier to exempt itself from the Commission\u2019s securities jurisdiction by inserting a holding company between itself and its stockholders. But the Securities and Exchange Commission will continue to regulate the holding company\u2019s issuance of securities to the public. Thus, the primary purpose of \u00a7 11,301 \u2014 to protect investors, <em>see Association of American Railroads v. United States, </em>603 F.2d 953, 968-70 (D.C. Cir.1979) (reviewing legislative history)\u2014 will not be lost. Only the secondary purpose \u2014 to ensure that railroads have sound finances \u2014 is weakened. There is no evidence in the record that this limited loophole has caused significant problems for the Commission in the past.<footnotemark>78</footnotemark> Thus, the apparent flaw in the statutory scheme gives us <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>no warrant to reject the ICC\u2019s construction of its governing statute.<footnotemark>79</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b414-4\">D. <em>Failure to Apply for Control of the Vermont &amp; Massachusetts Co.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b414-5\">The Vermont &amp; Massachusetts line is a 56-mile segment of the Boston &amp; Maine\u2019s main east-west line, nominally-owned by the Vermont &amp; Massachusetts Co., but leased to the Boston &amp; Maine under a 999-year lease and thus for all practical purposes owned by the Boston &amp; Maine. The Vermont &amp; Massachusetts Co. owns no other significant property. Prior to the merger, it was owned 37% by the Boston &amp; Maine, 37% by Guilford, 24% by Providence &amp; Worcester, and 2% by others. Thus, Guilford, when it acquired the Boston &amp; Maine, would automatically acquire control of the Vermont &amp; Massachusetts Co. as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-6\">Providence &amp; Worcester objects that Guilford failed to file a formal application to control the Vermont &amp; Massachusetts Co. The ICC found that Guilford had made a technical misstep but decided to consider and approve Guilford\u2019s control of the Vermont &amp; Massachusetts Co. on the merits. <em>See Boston &amp; Maine Merger, </em>366 I.C.C. at 347-48, 355. Providence &amp; Worcester was not prejudiced by this course of action. It had actual notice of Guilford\u2019s control proposal and indeed submitted its own responsive application to purchase the Vermont &amp; Massachusetts line, which the ICC considered and rejected. Providence &amp; Worcester raises no substantive objections to the ICC\u2019s reasoning.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-7\">Under these circumstances, we see no harm in the ICC\u2019s waiver of a formal application. Taking, as we must, \u201cdue account ... of the rule of prejudicial error,\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706 (last clause), we affirm the Commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-8\">E. <em>Premature Control of the Boston &amp; Maine</em></p>\n<p id=\"b414-9\">Guilford\u2019s acquisition agreement with the Boston &amp; Maine gave Guilford limited control over the Boston &amp; Maine\u2019s activities \u2014 primarily a veto over major corporate decisions \u2014 pending ICC approval of the transaction. Providence &amp; Worcester asserts that this control was illegal unless and until the Commission approved the acquisition, and that Guilford is therefore unfit to own the Boston &amp; Maine. The ICC responds that Guilford could not control the Boston &amp; Maine because the Boston &amp; Maine, as a bankrupt, was subject to the ultimate authority of the reorganization court.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-12\">We think the parties\u2019 dispute over whether Guilford crossed the ill-defined line between control and noncontrol is largely beside the point. Premature control \u201cdoes not automatically defeat a transaction.\u201d <em>Missouri Pacific Railroad </em>\u2014 Control\u2014Chica<em>go &amp; Eastern Illinois Railroad, </em>327 I.C.C. 279, 322 (1965), <em>aff\u2019d sub nom.

Rather, it is simply a factor in the Commission\u2019s overall decision whether a merger is in the public interest. <em>See Gilbertville Trucking Co. v. United States, </em>371 U.S. 115, 127, 83 S.Ct. 217, 225, 9 L.Ed.2d 177 (1962).</p>\n<p id=\"b414-13\">Here, the Commission found that the agreement was reasonable and entered into in good faith:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b414-14\">The negative covenants of the acquisition agreement are no more than standard safeguards to ensure that B &amp; M would emerge from reorganization in a position substantially similar to the one it was in at the time of the agreement.

The Commission did not reach the question whether the conditions requested by Lamoille Valley are in the public interest, but we have grave doubts whether they are. Essentially, Lamoille Valley has asked the Commission to award it a new and profitable route so that it can use the profits to subsidize losses on its existing route. That request appears to violate the Commission\u2019s policy against \u201csubsidizing] carriers who are no longer able to compete efficiently in the marketplace.\u201d 49 C.F.R. \u00a7 1180.1(d)(1) (1982) (quoted in full in note 8 supra). We cannot say that this policy is unreasonable in light of the congressional directive in the Staggers Rail Act, 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 10,101a(5), to \u201cfoster sound economic conditions in transportation.\u201d <em>Accord Brotherhood of Maintenance of Way Employees v.

Moreover, the ICC has the authority to impose conditions other than those initially suggested by Lamoille Valley. <em>See </em>notes 54-55 <em>infra </em>and accompanying text.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"31\">\n<p id=\"b397-16\">. In light of this disposition, we do not reach Lamoille Valley\u2019s claim that even if the ICC may use a \u201cbusiness termination\u201d test to measure the adequacy of alternate service, such a test is a major departure from prior policy for which the Commission failed to give a reasoned explanation. <em>See Missouri-Kan.-Tex.

United States, </em>639 F.2d 1096, 1099 (4th Cir.1981). Finally, we do not need to reach Lamoille Valley\u2019s challenge to the adequacy of Guilford\u2019s study of traffic diversion in light of the Commission\u2019s conclusion that, even using Guilford\u2019s diversion estimates, Lamoille Valley would suffer \u201cdevastating\u201d revenue losses.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"32\">\n<p id=\"b398-8\">.

The ICC\u2019s assertion that the Maine Central and the Boston &amp; Maine do not operate any \u201cparallel lines\u201d may be true in a narrow geometric sense, since the Maine Central\u2019s Mountain Division line (which carries traffic northwest) and the Boston &amp; Maine\u2019s east-west line (which carries traffic southwest and then west) diverge at a 90\u00b0 angle. The significant question, however, is whether the two lines compete for the same traffic, not whether they appear parallel on a map.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"34\">\n<p id=\"b399-8\">. There is also a problem with Lamoille Valley\u2019s requested relief. We do not see, and Lam-oille Valley has not explained, how Lamoille Valley\u2019s purchase of some Boston &amp; Maine track will cure the loss of competition between the Maine Central and the Boston &amp; Maine. The Commission \u201cwill not impose\u201d conditions on a merger because of anticompetitive effects unless the conditions \u201cwill ameliorate or eliminate the harmful effects.\u201d <em>Union </em>Pacific\u2014 <em>Control </em>\u2014 Missouri <em>Pacif\u00edc, supra </em>note 21, 366 I.C.C. at 565. Thus, whatever the competitive harm from the Maine Central/Boston &amp; Maine merger, Lamoille Valley would not seem to be entitled to the relief it seeks.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"35\">\n<p id=\"b399-9\">. In addition to its east-west service, Canadian National operates joint north-south service with the Boston &amp; Maine from Montreal to New York. Canadian National was concerned that Guilford would concentrate its efforts on east-west traffic and allow its north-south service to deteriorate. It therefore requested trackage rights over the Boston &amp; Maine\u2019s portion of the north-south line. The ICC denied this request as based on \u201cunsubstantiated fears\u201d of reduced service. <em>Boston &amp; Maine Merger, </em>366 I.C.C. at 352.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-14\">It is unclear whether Canadian National presses this request on appeal. It mentions the issue, <em>see </em>Canadian National Brief at 14-15, but advances no reasons why the ICC\u2019s decision is wrong. Assuming that the issue is before us, we conclude, for the reasons given in response to a similar claim in <em>Central Vermont Railway v. ICC, supra </em>note 1, 711 F.2d at 300, that any possible deterioration will not affect essential services.</p>\n<p id=\"AWD\">Deterioration of the Boston &amp; Maine\u2019s north-south service is also an essential component of Providence &amp; Worcester\u2019s explanation of why it needs protective conditions. Since downgrading will not affect essential services, we affirm the Commission\u2019s denial of Providence &amp; Worcester\u2019s request for conditions.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"36\">\n<p id=\"b400-6\">. Guilford\u2019s subsequent acquisition of the Delaware &amp; Hudson, which extends the Boston &amp; Maine\u2019s east-west route further west, increases Guilford\u2019s incentive to divert traffic from the Canadian National to the Boston &amp; Maine/Delaware &amp; Hudson line. Canadian National accordingly repeated its request for conditions in the Delaware &amp; Hudson merger decision. <em>See Delaware &amp; Hudson Merger, supra </em>note 1, 366 I.C.C. at 419. The ICC denied the request, relying on the reasons it gave in its <em>Boston &amp; Maine </em>decision. Our analysis of the Commission\u2019s reasoning applies equally to both decisions, and is incorporated by reference in the companion case to this one reviewing the Delaware &amp; Hudson merger. <em>See Central Vermont Railway </em>v. <em>ICC, supra </em>note 1, 711 F.2d at 300.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"37\">\n<p id=\"b400-7\">.

Giving Guilford a larger share of joint revenues may not even preserve fast service in the short run. As the Commission recently recognized in its <em>Rulemaking Concerning Traffic Protective Conditions, supra </em>note 27, 366 I.C.C. at 125-26, a competing carrier who participates in an efficient joint route (i.e., Canadian National) may be unable to pay enough to persuade the other participating carrier <em>{i.e., </em>Guilford) to prefer a joint route over the other carrier\u2019s less efficient single-line route. The record is silent on whether Canadian National can offer enough to persuade Guilford to maintain current interchange service.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"52\">\n<p id=\"b405-9\">. Technically, we have addressed, as did the Commission, only the probability that protective conditions will be needed and not the amount of public benefit from preserving Canadian National\u2019s service. There is little doubt, however, that the amount of benefit is substantial. There are now three competing railroads in the Maine-to-midwest corridor: Guilford, Canadian National, and Canadian Pacific. If Canadian National withdraws from the competition because of losses on its Grand Trunk Eastern line, only two competitors will be left. The ICC has recently held in reviewing another merger that loss of one of three existing competitors is \u201ca substantial lessening of competition.\u201d <em>Union Pacific </em>\u2014 Control\u2014Missouri <em>Pacific, supra </em>note 21, at 531. We do not see why a different result would obtain here.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-10\">Moreover, Canadian National\u2019s route is more efficient \u2014 in time, energy use, and switching costs \u2014 than the Boston &amp; Maine route.

ICC Chairman Taylor, concurring, believed that \u00a7 11,343 required joinder, but agreed that \u201cthis issue has no effect on the merits\u201d because Mr. Mellon\u2019s personal finances were not relevant to the Commission\u2019s decision. <em>Boston &amp; Maine Merger, </em>366 I.C.C. at 358 (Taylor, Chmn., concurring).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"65\">\n<p id=\"b409-11\">.

It is possible to distinguish <em>Marshall Transport </em>as not involving an explicit ICC finding that joinder would serve no useful purpose. The ICC, however, fails in its broader attempt to distinguish <em>Marshall Transport </em>as merely affirming the Commission\u2019s discretionary power to require appropriate persons to join a control application. <em>Marshall Transport </em>addresses both whether the Commission may require Un<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>Ion to join the control application, <em>see </em>322 U.S. at 36-40, 64 S.Ct. at 902, 903-904, and whether the Commission must do so, <em>see id. </em>at 40-42, 64 S.Ct. at 903-904. The Court\u2019s affirmative answer to the second issue was necessary to its decision because the full Commission had overruled its own division on that basis.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"67\">\n<p id=\"b410-11\">. It appears that Mr. Mellon did not join the control application in order not to disclose his personal finances. <em>See Boston &amp; Maine Merger, </em>366 I.C.C. at 325. As noted in text, however, Mr. Mellon could have asked the Commission to exempt him from its jurisdiction under 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 10,505(a). Moreover, he may not have had to answer questions about his finances even if he remained as an applicant. <em>See </em>366 I.C.C. at 325 n, 22 (\u201ceven if Mr. Mellon were to join as an applicant, he would only be required to file an affidavit stating that he joins in [Guilford\u2019s] application\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"68\">\n<p id=\"b410-18\">. The ICC\u2019s possible lack of \u201cauthority\u201d to approve the merger without joinder of Mr. Mellon does not foreclose a finding of harmless error because that lack is \u201cnot strictly jurisdictional in the sense that if the Commission wrongly decides that [Mr. Mellon does not need to join the application], the Commission loses jurisdiction over [Guilford].\u201d <em>AUeghany Corp. v.
