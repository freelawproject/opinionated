EDWARDS,</author>\n<p id=\"AYBx\">Circuit Judge:</p>\n<p id=\"b345-31\">We are asked in this case to review an arbitrator\u2019s decision in an adverse action case arising under the Civil Service Reform <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>Act of 1978 (\u201cCSRA\u201d or \u201cAct\u201d).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The underlying grievance arises out of the discharge of an employee at the General Services Administration (\u201cGSA\u201d) for theft of government property. In upholding the agency\u2019s discharge action, the arbitrator ruled in effect that he was without authority to consider mitigation of the penalty. Instead, the arbitrator returned the petitioner\u2019s grievance to the GSA for it to give \u201cdue consideration\u201d to the mitigating circumstances surrounding the employee\u2019s discharge.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-4\">The sole issue before this court is whether the arbitrator\u2019s deference to the employer was in accordance with law.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Because we hold that, absent some permissible contractual limitation, an arbitrator, like the Merit Systems Protection Board (\u201cMSPB\u201d), has independent authority to determine the appropriateness of penalties in adverse action cases, we reverse and remand to the arbitrator for further consideration in light of this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-5\">I. Background</p>\n<p id=\"Aj5\">A. <em>Factual Background</em></p>\n<p id=\"AHD\">From 1979 until February 10, 1982, Joseph T. Moore was a WG-3 Laborer in the Administrative Services Division at the National Archives and Records Service (\u201cNARS\u201d or \u201cArchives\u201d) of the GSA. Prior to the events giving rise to this case, Moore had an unblemished work record at the Archives. However, in October 1981, Moore voluntarily confessed to his supervisor that on several occasions he had assisted a fellow employee, Anthony Dailey, who had stolen cash contained in mail sent to the Archives. Moore\u2019s confession was apparently motivated by his religious beliefs and his serious conviction that he should seek to correct his past misdeeds.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-11\">Acting on his own initiative, and pursuant to conscience, Moore gave a complete, recorded statement on October 27, 1981, concerning the theft of government property. This confession was made in the presence of his second-line supervisor, a GSA investigator, and a Postal Inspector. Petitioner\u2019s Appendix (\u201cApp.\u201d) 10-20. Following his confession, Moore willingly cooperated with government officials in agreeing to wear a hidden recording device and to meet with Dailey in an effort to secure additional incriminating evidence.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b346-12\">Moore\u2019s confession statement asserts that he never actually took any money himself. On one occasion he apparently kept money for Dailey and on another occasion he admittedly helped Dailey wash some stolen bills and exchange them at a liquor store. App. 14-16. Moore also acknowledged ripping up envelopes from which money had been stolen and flushing the envelopes down the toilet. App. 19. He claimed that he warned Dailey that the mail room where they worked appeared to be monitored by cameras, and he suggested that his only profit from Dailey's thefts was about $40.00 that Dailey gave him. App. 18-19.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-13\">Initially, no job action was taken by the GSA against Moore for his confessed involvement in Dailey\u2019s scheme. Subsequently, in a criminal proceeding, Moore pled guilty to theft of government property, a misdemeanor.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> On December 16, 1981, he was sentenced to one year\u2019s probation. On the same day, he received notice of the GSA\u2019s intention to fire him because of this conviction. Shortly thereafter, the Postal Inspector who had previously questioned <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>him sent a letter to the Archives commending Moore for his cooperation. Additionally, Moore\u2019s Probation Officer requested that Moore be permitted to retain his employment. Finally, the Chief Shop Steward of Local 2578 of the American Federation of Government Employees (\u201cAFGE\u201d) suggested that Moore\u2019s penalty be reduced to a letter of reprimand because of his cooperation with law enforcement officials. However, the GSA confirmed Moore\u2019s removal from the Federal Service. The termination letter stated, \u201c[e]ven considering your participation in the investigation and other circumstances, the seriousness of your offense demands that your services with this agency be terminated. Your conviction for this offense creates a serious problem of trust in any position in this agency.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b347-5\">B. <em>The Arbitration Proceedings</em></p>\n<p id=\"b347-6\">Local 2578 commenced grievance proceedings on Moore\u2019s behalf pursuant to the NARS Negotiated Grievance Procedure. The Union requested that Moore be reinstated with back pay or that the removal be reduced to a lesser penalty. When the matter was not settled, the grievance was appealed to arbitration under Article 9, Section 5 of the Union-Management Agreement <footnotemark>6</footnotemark> in accordance with section 7121(b)(3)(C) of the CSRA.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> After a hearing and briefing, the arbitrator held that theft normally constitutes just cause for discharge, and that the severity of the penalty was within the discretion of the employing agency.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The arbitrator noted that the GSA appeared to have \u201ctotally\u2019 disregarded\u201d the Probation Officer\u2019s request and thus ordered the GSA to reconsider its decision. He stated that if the GSA were to adhere to its decision that Moore should be discharged, \u201cthe Arbitrator will not find that the Agency [GSA] violated the contractual standard.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The GSA adhered to its dismissal decision. This petition for review followed. This court has jurisdiction pursuant to 5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 7121(f) and 7703(c) (Supp. V 1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b347-14\">II. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b347-15\">AFGE\u2019s argument that the arbitrator erred in deferring to the employing agency concerning mitigation of Moore\u2019s penalty proceeds in two stages. The Union observes, first, that, under the CSRA, arbitral and Merit Systems Protection Board decisions concerning adverse actions are governed by the same standards. Since the MSPB is empowered independently to assess the severity of penalties imposed by employing agencies, the argument continues, arbitrators must, of necessity, possess this same power to mitigate penalties. The GSA, relying on <em>Gipson </em>v. <em>Veterans Administration, </em>682 F.2d 1004 (D.C.Cir.1982), responds that this court may not substitute its judgment for that of the employing agency unless the penalty is so excessive as to constitute an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>Initially, we should make clear our view that nothing in the CSRA requires that arbitration and MSPB actions always adhere to the same standards and procedures, or produce the same results in like cases. However, we agree with AFGE that, in this case, the arbitrator\u2019s complete failure independently to consider the severity of the penalty imposed on Moore requires that this matter be remanded for such consideration. The GSA\u2019s argument to the contrary is unavailing because it incorrectly assumes that the agency\u2019s discharge sanction received adequate review by the arbitrator. Because no independent consideration of mitigating factors has occurred here, <em>Gip-son </em>is inapposite. In <em>Gipson, </em>this court found that the MSPB had considered mitigating factors independently of the employing agency. 682 F.2d at 1012 n. 15. Thus, our review was limited to whether the MSPB abused its discretion in its consideration of these factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-4\">A. <em>The Statutory Framework</em></p>\n<p id=\"b348-5\">The CSRA establishes a comprehensive system for review of personnel hiring, promotion and dismissal decisions in the federal sector. In adverse action discharges under section 7512,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> the CSRA permits recourse by an aggrieved employee either to the MSPB, or, if a collective bargaining agreement exists, pursuant to a contractual grievance and arbitration procedure.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7121(e)(1) (Supp. V 1981). Because Moore chose to appeal the GSA\u2019s decision to fire him under the Union-Management Agreement, we deal here with an appeal from an arbitral judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-6\">In <em>Devine v. White, </em>697 F.2d 421 (D.C.Cir. 1988),'we recently examined at length the standard of review applicable to arbitration decisions under the CSRA. The court there noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b348-11\">Appeals <em>by aggrieved employees </em>from decisions of arbitrators or the MSPB in adverse action cases are governed by section 7703(c), which requires the court to set aside any actions, findings, or conclusions to be found</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b348-12\">(1) arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b348-13\">(2) obtained without procedures required by law, rule, or regulation having been followed; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b348-14\">(3) unsupported by substantial evidence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b348-15\"><em>Id. </em>at 439 (emphasis in original; footnote omitted). In applying the same standard of review to both MSPB and arbitration decisions, Congress sought to promote some uniformity of process and to ensure that the statutory procedures adequately protect the rights of government employees.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> However, the principal point made in <em>Devine v. White </em>is that, under the CSRA (as in the private sector), the Act \u201cleaves arbitrators\u2019 interpretations of collective bargaining agreements themselves largely unreviewa-ble.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 440. The court in <em>Devine v. White </em>thus concluded that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b348-16\">Only if the court determines that the arbitrator erred as a matter of law in' interpreting a civil service law, rule, or regulation can it upset his decision \u2014 a standard of review that is at least as deferential as the standard governing review of arbitral decisions in the private sector.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>We conclude, therefore, that (1) the policies favoring extremely limited judicial review of arbitrators\u2019 decisions are fully applicable in the federal sector; (2) Congress recognized the advantages of arbitration, but effected a limited departure from the private sector\u2019s tradition of deference to ensure that arbitrators\u2019 decisions, like the decisions of the MSPB, adequately protect federal employees\u2019 rights....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b349-5\"><em>Id. </em>(footnotes omitted). With this limited scope of review in mind, we turn to the merits of petitioner\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-6\">B. <em>The Arbitrator\u2019s Failure to Consider Mitigation</em></p>\n<p id=\"b349-7\">The' principal problem in this case \u2014 at least insofar as judicial review is concerned \u2014 is not the arbitrator\u2019s decision<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> but the manner in which it was reached. In ruling that his <em>\u201csole </em>function [was] to determine whether the offence constitute^] \u2018just cause\u2019,\u201d App. 5 (emphasis added), and that questions of mitigation were \u201cmore properly addressed to the employer,\u201d App. 4, the arbitrator abdicated his responsibility to fully consider Moore\u2019s grievance. We reach this conclusion in light of our holding that an arbitrator hearing a case under the CSRA must consider issues of mitigation unless the parties\u2019 contract lawfully provides otherwise. Since the arbitrator in this case failed to comply with this rule, his decision must be overturned. In other words, \u201c[a] wholesale and unexplained failure to apply ... rules governing the arbitration process ... \u2018manifest^] an infidelity\u2019 td the arbitrator\u2019s defining obligations ... justify[ing] [judicial] review.\u201d <em>Devine v. White, </em>697 F.2d at 446 (Lumbard, J., concurring).</p>\n<p id=\"b349-8\">As we have already indicated, Congress intended that there be some symmetry between the arbitration and MSPB processes in order \u201c[t]o promote consistency and to discourage forum shopping.\u201d <em>Devine v. White, </em>697 F.2d at 428. The inequity of an arbitrator having less authority than the MSPB to deal with the same adverse action is self-evident; an aggrieved employee would be likely to choose the forum providing the greatest independent review of an adverse decision. Even a cursory evaluation of the statute makes it plain that the CSRA sets arbitration on a par with administrative review before the MSPB. Therefore, we conclude that, absent some permissible contractual limitation, arbitrators must have the same inherent authority as the MSPB to mitigate employer-imposed penalties. For these reasons, and those outlined below, we hold that the arbitrator in this case erred as a matter of law in declining to consider the issue of mitigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-13\">1. <em>The MSPB\u2019s Independent Authority to Mitigate</em></p>\n<p id=\"b349-14\">The MSPB clearly has independent authority to consider whether a penalty chosen by an employing agency is appropriate for the specific misconduct involved. <em>Parsons v. United States Department of the Air Force, </em>707 F.2d 1406 (D.C.Cir.1983); <em>Douglas v. Veterans Administration, </em>5 M.S. P.B. 313 (1981). <em>Douglas </em>ably traces both the historical and practical bases of this authority, noting that the Civil Service Commission (\u201cCommission\u201d), the predecessor of the MSPB, was authorized to weigh the severity of penalties imposed by employing agencies. <em>See Douglas, </em>5 M.S.P.B. at 319-23. In enacting the CSRA, Congress plainly intended to vest the MSPB with the same authority previously exercised by the Commission to consider issues of mitigation. <em>Id. </em>at 319-21.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-15\">In elaborating on this point, the court in <em>Parsons v. United States Department of the Air Force </em>held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-16\">In an agency removal action based on employee misconduct, the agency must make three determinations: (1) that the employee actually committed the alleged misconduct; (2) that there is a sufficient nexus between the misconduct and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>efficiency of the service to sustain an adverse action; and (3) that the penalty imposed has been appropriately chosen for the specific misconduct involved.... The agency has the burden of persuasion regarding these three elements of its decision and is therefore obligated to present evidence to the Board necessary to support each element.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b350-4\">[T]he selection of an appropriate penalty is a distinct element of an agency\u2019s decision. The agency therefore has the ultimate burden of persuading the MSPB of the appropriateness of the penalty imposed .... This is necessary even if ... the penalized employee has not raised a question as to the appropriateness of the imposed sanction.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b350-5\">At 1409, 1410 (footnotes and citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b350-6\">Additionally, as a practical matter, if the MSPB were required to remand cases involving excessive penalties to the employing agency for reconsideration, the result would be a potentially endless series of remands and appeals until the MSPB found that the employing agency had chosen the appropriate penalty. <em>See Douglas, </em>5 M.S.P.B. at 323. This result would clearly run contrary to Congress\u2019 express desire for a system that provides for expeditious processing of adverse action cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-7\">2. <em>Private Sector Arbitration</em></p>\n<p id=\"b350-8\">We find further support for the arbitrator\u2019s mitigation authority when we examine the traditional role of arbitrators in private sector discipline and discharge cases.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> In private arbitral proceedings, if the collective bargaining agreement provides for grievance and arbitration of discharges or other employer-imposed penalties, the arbitrator\u2019s authority to consider the appropriateness of these penalties is well-established.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> So central is this authority that even if a collective bargaining agreement fails specifically to authorize an arbitrator to modify improper penalties, the power \u201cmay be deemed inherent in his power to decide the sufficiency of cause\u201d for discharge.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Under an agreement requiring just cause for dismissal, arbitrators will frequently, at a minimum, review the penalty to assure that it is not \u201cunreasonable, capricious or arbitrary action.\u201d<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b350-12\">We do not mean to suggest that arbitrators in the federal sector must adhere precisely to arbitral practices or decisions in the private sector concerning mitigation of penalties. Rather, we look to the private sector to determine only that, absent contractual provisions to the contrary, the authority to mitigate traditionally has been viewed as inherent in the arbitral function. Given this firm tradition, and in light of the fact that the MSPB, too, retains the clear authority to reduce disciplinary penalties in adverse action cases pursuant to principles of mitigation, we can imagine no less authority for arbitrators hearing cases under the CSRA.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-13\">3. <em>The Standard of Judicial Review</em></p>\n<p id=\"b350-14\">Finally, the importance of arbitral and MSPB authority to consider the appropriateness of penalties is reinforced by the highly deferential standard of judicial review of arbitral and MSPB decisions. As noted above, the decision in <em>Devine v. White </em>emphasized the desirability of limited judicial review of arbitral decisions. While courts must oversee uniform and correct application of applicable statutes and regulations in both MSPB and arbitral proceedings, the <em>Devine </em>court noted that, generally, one of the advantages of arbitration over litigation in personnel cases is the traditional judicial deference to arbitration. 697 F.2d at 435. The court reaffirmed that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>deference in the federal sector, <em>id. </em>at 435-40,<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> noting that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b351-4\">[i]f arbitration becomes simply another level of decisionmaking, subject to judicial review on the merits, arbitrators may begin to decide cases and write opinions in such a way as to insulate their awards against judicial reversal \u2014 producing opinions that parrot the appropriate statutory standards in conclusory terms, but suffer from lack of reasoned analysis. Such a shift from the arbitral model ... would substantially undercut the ability of arbitrators successfully to resolve disputes arising out of the employment relationship.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b351-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 436.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-6\">For judicial deference to arbitral decisions to have meaningful application, the reviewing court must be confident that the arbitrator has undertaken a thorough review of each aspect of an adverse action. Accordingly, arbitrators, just like the MSPB, must review all aspects of an employer\u2019s adverse action decision in order for the court to defer to the process with confidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-7\">One exception to this holding is arguably mandated by the statute itself. Under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7121(a)(2) (Supp. V 1981), contracting parties presumably are free to limit the arbitrator\u2019s authority by agreement. In the present petition for review, however, neither party has argued that the collective bargaining agreement pursuant to which AFGE brought this matter to arbitration limited the arbitrator\u2019s authority to consider mitigating factors. When the parties have not lawfully removed this mitigation authority from the arbitrator, he must decide issues relating to the appropriateness of the penalty.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b351-8\">III. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b351-9\">Because the arbitrator in this case failed entirely even to consider the question of mitigation, we remand the case for further consideration. On remand, the arbitrator must evaluate the effect of Moore\u2019s voluntary confession, his cooperation with government authorities, the parole officer\u2019s recommendation, and of any other factors relevant to the appropriateness of the GSA\u2019s penalty of dismissal. We emphasize that we do not suggest what the arbitrator\u2019s judgment should be; our only concern in this case is that the arbitrator did not exercise any judgment with respect to mitigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-12\">The case is hereby remanded to the arbitrator for further proceedings as may be necessary to consider mitigation. The arbitrator\u2019s fee and related costs shall be paid in the same manner and on the same terms as was done pursuant to the initial arbitration hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-13\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b346-6\">.
