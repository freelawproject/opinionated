Kandlbinder (\u201cKan-dlbinder\u201d), resulted from negligent medical treatment at the John Cochran Veterans Administration Hospital (\u201cCochran V.A.\u201d) in St. Louis, Missouri.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-27\">Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636(c), the parties agreed to have their case tried before a magistrate. After a nonjury trial, the magistrate entered judgment against the government in the amount of $170,690.00. In this proceeding, the government challenges three of the magistrate\u2019s findings of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>fact as clearly erroneous. In light of the record as a whole, we conclude that the challenged findings were not clearly erroneous and therefore affirm the magistrate\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-5\">Kandlbinder served in the United States Air Force from 1961 to 1966. During his service, he suffered from and was treated for chronic abdominal pain. In 1961, he spent five days in the Air Force hospital at Bunker Hill Air Force Base, Indiana. His problem was diagnosed as acute gastritis, type and cause undetermined. In October, 1964, an Air Force physician treated him for peptic ulcer disease. Kandlbinder was then hospitalized in November, 1964, for treatment of a duodenal ulcer. He was placed on a Sippy diet<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and released after 27 days as asymptomatic.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-6\">Kandlbinder continued to experience intermittent epigastric pain. Pain relievers and antacids were prescribed by Air Force physicians in December, 1964, and February, 1965. In February, 1965, an upper gastrointestinal tract x-ray (\u201cupper G.I.\u201d) indicated that the duodenal ulcer was smaller but still active. Pain relievers and antacids were again prescribed in May, 1965. An upper G.I. in August, 1965, showed no active duodenal ulcer.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-7\">Before Kandlbinder was discharged from the Air Force in May, 1966, a separation examination was performed by an Air Force physician. The upper G.I. then taken was negative for an active ulcer and showed scarring from a healed ulcer. The physician\u2019s report noted that Kandlbinder continued to experience epigastric pain relieved by antacids. In June, 1966, Kan-dlbinder was granted a service-related disability due to his ulcer condition. The disability report noted that Kandlbinder complained of pains in the mid-lower epigastric region with cramps after meals. A second disability evaluation was performed in December, 1966. The disability was reaffirmed and epigastric cramps again noted.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-10\">In March, 1967, Kandlbinder began outpatient treatment at Cochran V.A. At his first examination, the physician noted Kah-dlbinder\u2019s history of duodenal ulcer and his use of antacids. An upper G.I. was performed in April, 1967. The test showed no evidence of an ulcer niche and indicated that the duodenal bulb, loop and small bowel were normal. No other diagnostic tests were performed. Pain relievers were again prescribed.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-11\">On November 11,1971, a disability examination was performed at another St. Louis V.A. hospital. The examining physician\u2019s report noted that Kandlbinder was not under the care of a licensed medical doctor, but was being treated at Cochran V.A. The report mentioned that Kandlbinder experienced minor attacks of abdominal pain for which he took antacids. An upper G.I. demonstrated no ulcer crater but showed a minimally deformed duodenal bulb.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-12\">Kandlbinder made approximately 30 visits to Cochran V.A. through October, 1973. The physicians frequently prescribed antacids and somewhat less frequently prescribed pain relievers and anti-anxiety medication. Although few entries from the physicians\u2019 records described Kandlbinder\u2019s complaints and symptoms, a number indicated that he was \u201cimproving\u201d or \u201cdoing well.\u201d Dramamine was prescribed at one point for nausea during flight. A second upper G.I. was performed in May, 1973. No abnormalities were found.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-13\">Kandlbinder made his final visit to Cochran V.A. in October, 1973. The physician noted that Kandlbinder experienced belching after meals and felt he had excess stomach acid. No diagnostic tests other than the two upper G.I.\u2019s of April, 1967, and May, 1973, were performed at Cochran V.A.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-14\">On June 6, 1977, Kandlbinder was admitted to St. Francis Mercy Hospital in Washington, Missouri, complaining of acute abdominal pain. Kandlbinder died on June 8, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>1977. The cause of death as discerned by autopsy was hemorrhagic pancreatis resulting from cholelithiasis, <em>i.e., </em>gallstone(s) blocking a pancreatic duct. The autopsy revealed the presence of at least 50 gallstones in Kandlbinder\u2019s gall bladder.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-6\">The magistrate concluded that as a matter of law,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the physicians who treated Kan-dlbinder at Cochran V.A. failed to exercise the appropriate degree of skill and learning in diagnosing and treating Kandlbinder\u2019s condition.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The government challenges three findings of fact that contributed to the magistrate\u2019s conclusion of negligence:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b159-7\">1. That Kandlbinder had gall bladder disease during the course of his treatment at Cochran V.A. (Finding of Fact 17).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b159-8\">2. That Kandlbinder exhibited symptoms of gall bladder disease while being treated at Cochran V.A. (Finding of Fact 17).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b159-9\">3. That Cochran V.A. physicians deviated from acceptable standards of medical care by failing to perform tests and diagnostic procedures that would have determined whether Kan-dlbinder had gall bladder disease. (Finding of Fact 16).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b159-10\">A trial court\u2019s findings may not be set aside unless this Court concludes that they are clearly erroneous. Fed.R.Civ.P. 52(a); <em>United States v. United States Gypsum Co., </em>333 U.S. 364, 394, 68 S.Ct. 525, 541, 92 L.Ed. 746 (1948); <em>Aunt Mid, Inc. v. Fjell-Oranje Lines, </em>458 F.2d 712, 716 (7th Cir.1972), <em>cert, denied, </em>409 U.S. 877, 93 S.Ct. 130, 34 L.Ed.2d 131 (1972). Upon review of the record, we conclude that there is sufficient evidence to support the magistrate\u2019s findings and to preclude a holding by this Court that the findings were clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-12\">The testimony of four expert witnesses was presented at trial: Dr. Dilip Banarjee, who treated Kandlbinder immediately before his death at St. Francis Mercy Hospital; Dr. Darrell Fort, who was deposed as the government\u2019s expert; Dr. Joseph Sapa-la, who was deposed as the plaintiffs\u2019 expert; and Dr. Robert Scheff, a St. Louis physician called by the court as its own expert.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b159-13\">Dr. Banarjee testified, <em>inter alia, </em>that it was \u201chighly probable\u201d that Kandlbinder had gall bladder disease and stones during the period he was treated at Cochran V.A., i.e., 1967-1973. He indicated that when the upper G.I.\u2019s were normal in the face of continued abdominal pain, the \u201ccommon standard practice\u201d would have been to have \u201clooked into\u201d other possible problems.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b159-14\">Dr. Scheff testified, <em>inter alia, </em>that, based upon a reasonable degree of certainty, Kan-dlbinder \u201cprobably\u201d had gallstones during his treatment at Cochran V.A. In his opinion, tests other than upper G.I.\u2019s should have been performed, including an x-ray of the gall bladder. Dr. Scheff noted that the physicians\u2019 records from Cochran V.A. were not at all thorough and did not explain the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>actions taken by the physicians, <em>e.g., </em>upper GJ.\u2019s and prescriptions of antacids and pain relievers.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b160-4\">Dr. Fort testified, <em>inter alia, </em>that in his opinion, Kandlbinder had only peptic ulcer disease during the period of his visits to Cochran V.A. and responded to proper treatment.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b160-5\">Dr. Sapala testified, <em>inter alia, </em>that Kan-dlbinder \u201cprobably\u201d had gallstones from 1966 until his death. In his opinion, the Cochran V.A. physicians failed to exercise proper medical judgment in not performing a series of tests or ultra sound on the gall bladder. Dr. Sapala testified that \u201c99 percent\u201d of all physicians would have automatically ordered gall bladder tests when ordering an upper G.I.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b160-6\">Despite some testimony contrary to the challenged findings, numerous statements of the expert witnesses support each of the magistrate\u2019s contested findings. <em>United States Gypsum, supra, </em>333 U.S. at 394, 68 5. Ct. at 541. The magistrate was able to observe the demeanor of Dr. Scheff and Dr. Sapala in person, and to observe Dr. Banar-jee and Dr. Fort by way of video-taped deposition. We are required to defer to the credibility assessments made by the trier of fact. Given the testimony presented at trial, his findings were not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-8\">The government contends, nonetheless, that a finding that Kandlbinder had gall bladder disease can only be based upon speculation and therefore must be set aside. Specifically, the government suggested at oral argument that since no gall bladder test was performed on Kandlbinder during the course of his treatment at Cochran V.A., it is now impossible to determine with requisite certainty whether he in fact had gall bladder disease at that time. In effect, the government would have us decide that Cochran V.A.\u2019s <em>negligence in not running a gall bladder series </em>on Kandlbinder should now shield it from a finding of <em>negligence for its failure to treat him for gall bladder disease. </em>The government reasons that absent testing at time of treatment, gall bladder disease could not have been diagnosed with absolute certainty and, therefore, it would be speculative to conclude at this point in time that he had the disease when treated.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-13\">We find this argument disingenuous. It is true that there is no way of ascertaining at this point that had a gall bladder series been run, the disease would have been discovered in Kandlbinder during the period of his treatment at Cochran V.A. However, the very reason speculation is now necessary is that the Cochran V.A. physicians failed to perform basic diagnostic tests. Thus, Cochran V.A.\u2019s negligence in failing to test Kandlbinder for gall bladder disease is not contrary to, but in fact is supportive of, the magistrate\u2019s finding that Kandlbin-der\u2019s treatment at the hospital was performed negligently. If the government\u2019s contention were accepted, liability for the results of inadequate medical testing would always be avoided.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-14\">For these reasons, we conclude that the challenged findings were not clearly erroneous. Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b158-8\">. The Sippy diet is a regimen of frequent feedings and alkalies used in the treatment of peptic ulcer disease.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b159-15\">. It is not disputed that Missouri law governs the issue of liability in this case. <em>Doss v.
