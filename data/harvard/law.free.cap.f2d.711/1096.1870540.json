CAMPBELL,</author>\n<p id=\"ANf\">Chief Judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b1183-12\">AMF appeals from the denial of its motion to hold the defendants Raymond Jew-ett and Walthem Chemical Pump Corporation (Walchem) in civil contempt of a consent decree. The decree permanently enjoins Jewett and Walchem from using AMF\u2019s trademarks, trade names, and parts and model numbers in connection with the sale of chemical metering pumps and related components. Alleging that defendants had violated the decree, AMF moved, pursuant to a provision in the decree retaining jurisdiction, for an order holding Jewett and Walchem in civil contempt and awarding damages. Following lengthy discovery and an eight-day trial, the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts issued a memorandum and order denying AMF\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1183-13\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1183-14\">AMF and Jewett have been involved in business dealings since 1973. In May of that year, AMF purchased from Jewett and an associate the assets of the Precision Control Products Corporation, a company that produced and sold Precision chemical metering pumps. Through this purchase, AMF obtained the rights to the trade names \u201cPrecision Control Products,\u201d and \u201cPrecision,\u201d to the trademarks \u201cSentrol,\u201d \u201cDia-ton,\u201d and \u201cPCP,\u201d and to the copyrights, model numbers, manufacturing methods, and labels used in the production and sale of metering pumps. Jewett, who had been president of the company prior to its acquisition, accepted employment with AMF and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1100\">*1100</page-number>agreed not to compete in the chemical pump business for a stated period thereafter.</p>\n<p id=\"b1184-4\">Eleven months after purchasing Precision Control Products, AMF transferred the company from Waltham, Massachusetts to Meriden, Connecticut, as a part of the AMF Cuno Division. Jewett resigned from his position with AMF and formed a new corporation at the company\u2019s old location in Waltham. As its name \u2014 Precision Chemical Pump Service Corporation \u2014 implied, Jewett\u2019s new venture was an authorized service center for AMF Precision pumps. In March 1975 Jewett assumed a distributor function as well as a service function, and changed his company\u2019s name to Precision Chemical Pump Corporation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1184-5\">In the fall of 1976, after his non-competition agreement with AMF expired, Jewett acquired an interest in Liquid Metronies, a newly formed company that was beginning to compete with AMF. When Jewett informed AMF of his interest in Liquid Me-tronics, AMF terminated Jewett\u2019s authorized dealer and service center contracts and demanded that Jewett cease doing business under the name Precision. Jewett refused and AMF brought suit in May 1977, alleging that Jewett\u2019s unauthorized use of the name Precision violated the Lanham Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1051-1127, and related state laws proscribing unfair methods of competition.</p>\n<p id=\"b1184-6\">The parties\u2019 settlement negotiations culminated in the consent decree at issue here. The decree, which is set forth in the appendix hereto, was approved by the court on September 15, 1977.</p>\n<p id=\"b1184-7\">In June 1980, three years after entry of the decree, AMF brought this motion for an order holding Jewett and Walchem in civil contempt. The contempt proceeding was heard by a judge other than the one who had handled AMF\u2019s initial suit and had approved the consent decree. In denying the motion, the district court concluded that AMF had failed to establish clearly and convincingly that defendants had violated the decree. The court also held that the terms of the consent decree were ambiguous, that defendants had used their best efforts to comply, and that AMF failed to show that certain technical violations of the decree were likely to cause confusion among customers as to the origin of certain Walchem products.</p>\n<p id=\"b1184-9\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1184-10\">The parties vigorously dispute the nature of the standard by which this court should review the district court\u2019s interpretation of the consent decree. We decline an extended exegesis, but some discussion seems necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b1184-11\">We start with the principle that the complainant must prove contempt by clear and convincing evidence. <em>See Burke v. Guiney, </em>700 F.2d 767, 769 (1st Cir.1983); <em>Vertex Distributing, Inc. </em>v. <em>Falcon Foam Plastics, Inc., </em>689 F.2d 885, 889 (9th Cir. 1982); 11 C. Wright &amp; A. Miller, <em>Federal Practice and Procedure: Civil </em>\u00a7 2960 at 591. Another even more familiar principle is that the district court\u2019s findings of fact are not to be set aside unless clearly erroneous. <em>See </em>Fed.RCiv.P. 52(a); <em>Kittitas Reclamation District v. Sunnyside Valley Irrigation District, </em>626 F.2d 95, 98 (9th Cir. 1980), <em>cert. denied, </em>449 U.S. 1079, 101 S.Ct. 861, 66 L.Ed.2d 802 (1981). Together these principles suggest that a district court\u2019s refusal to find contempt should not be overturned lightly.</p>\n<p id=\"b1184-12\">It does not follow, however, that the district court\u2019s actions are unreviewable. Here there was little dispute as to defendants\u2019 actual conduct. The controversy at the trial centered largely on the interpretation of defendants\u2019 activities in light of the meaning and purpose of the decree. We have referred to this process of interpretation as analogous to the interpretation of contracts. <em>See Massachusetts Association for Retarded Citizens, Inc. v. King, </em>668 F.2d 602, 607 (1st Cir. 1981) (citing <em>United States v. ITT Continental Baking Co., </em>420 U.S. 223, 238, 95 S.Ct. 926, 935, 43 L.Ed.2d 148 (1975)). Courts of appeal have considerable freedom to review the district court\u2019s determination of such matters, which are often characterized, whether or not correctly, as \u201cquestions of law.\u201d <em>Vertex Distributing, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1101\">*1101</page-number>689 F.2d at 892; <em>Eaton v. Courtaulds of North America, Inc., </em>578 F.2d 87, 90 (5th Cir.1978). <em>Cf. </em>3 <em>Corbin on Contracts </em>\u00a7 554 (1960) (issues of contract meaning are actually all questions of fact although some are for the court alone rather than for the jury).</p>\n<p id=\"b1185-5\">Courts, to be sure, have also spoken of reviewing the district court in contempt matters only for an abuse of discretion. <em>See Washington-Baltimore Newspaper Guild v. The Washington Post Co., </em>626 F.2d 1029, 1031 (D.C.Cir.1980); <em>V.T.A., Inc. v. Airco, Inc., </em>597 F.2d 220, 226-27 (10th Cir. 1979). Even under that standard, however, the lower court\u2019s construction of the meaning of language in a consent decree is subject to closer scrutiny than is likely appropriate as to ordinary factual questions. <em>See, eg., United States </em>v. <em>ITT Continental Baking Co., </em>420 U.S. 223, 95 S.Ct. 926, 43 L.Ed.2d 148 (1975) (reversing lower court\u2019s interpretation of the term \u201cacquiring\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1185-6\">The reason for differing articulations of the standard of review undoubtedly lies in the wide variety of circumstances in which contempt proceedings may arise. A civil contempt proceeding involving a commercial consent decree involves different considerations from one involving, say, a defaulting spouse under a support order. In dictum that has come to be regarded as the leading statement of the complaining party\u2019s right to a remedial order upon a showing of a violation of an injunction and resultant injury, Judge Magruder distinguished between coercive contempt proceedings and remedial proceedings of the sort involved here, stating that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ar0\">[i]f the complainant makes a showing that respondent has disobeyed a decree in complainant\u2019s favor and that damages have resulted to complainant thereby, complainant is entitled as of right to an order imposing a compensatory fine. The court has no discretion to withhold the appropriate remedial order. In this respect, the situation is unlike that of criminal contempt where the court may withhold punishment for the past act of disobedience. An order imposing a compensatory fine in a civil contempt proceeding is thus somewhat analogous to a tort judgment for damages caused by wrongful conduct.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1185-8\"><em>Parker v. United States, </em>153 F.2d 66, 70 (1st Cir.1946) (citations omitted). <em>See also G &amp; C Merriam Co. v. Webster Dictionary Co., </em>639 F.2d 29, 41 (1st Cir.1980); <em>Vuitton et Fils, S.A. v. Carousel Handbags, </em>592 F.2d 126, 130 (2d Cir.1979); Rendleman, <em>Compensatory Contempt: Plaintiffs Remedy When a Defendant Violates an Injunction, </em>1980 U.Ill.L.F. 971, 979.</p>\n<p id=\"b1185-9\">This court has observed that in interpreting consent decrees entered into by private parties, courts adhere more closely to contract principles than when interpreting broader, programmatic decrees entered into in public law litigation, where a more flexible approach may be required. See <em>Massachusetts Association for Retarded Citizens, Inc. v. King, </em>668 F.2d at 607-08. Private commercial disputants typically understand the business realities of their agreements and broader questions of public policy are not implicated. A civil finding of contempt in the private context essentially triggers a payment of money damages as in garden variety tort or contract litigation. There is no risk of the kinds of societal disruptions that may be threatened in the public law context where judicial discretion may well be crucial to securing complex legal goals. Those who give up the advantages of a lawsuit in return for obligations contained in a negotiated decree, rely upon and have a right to expect a fairly literal interpretation of the bargain that was struck and approved by the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1185-10\">This is not to say that a court should construe an ambiguous decree against the party burdened with compliance. The Federal Rules of Civil Procedure provide that \u201c[e]very order granting an injunction ... shall be specific in terms [and] shall describe in reasonable detail ... the act or acts sought to be restrained.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 65(d). This provision has been interpreted as a bar to the enforcement of decrees too vague to inform the burdened party \u201cwhat the court intends to require and what it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1102\">*1102</page-number>means to forbid.\u201d <em>International Longshoremen\u2019s Association, Local 1291 v. Philadelphia Marine Trade Association, </em>389 U.S. 64, 76, 88 S.Ct. 201, 208, 19 L.Ed.2d 236 (1967). An order, however, need not spell out \u201cthe components of a term whose boundaries are understood by common parlance.\u201d <em>United States v. Professional Air Traffic Controllers Organization, </em>678 F.2d 1, 3 (1st Cir.1982). Nor is a decree unen-forceably vague simply because a dispute later arises over the meaning of some of its terms.</p>\n<p id=\"b1186-4\">We do not view the present case as one in which we confront acts alleged to violate \u201ca decree that can only be described as unintelligible.\u201d <em>International Longshoremen\u2019s Association, Local 1291 v. Philadelphia Marine Trade Association, </em>389 U.S. at 76, 88 S.Ct. at 208. Unlike the situation in <em>Local 1291, </em>defendants were closely involved, with assistance of counsel, in the negotiation of the decree and were obviously interested in obtaining, and did in fact obtain, a reasonably clear statement of the practices from which they were to abstain. This was not, as in <em>Local 1291, </em>a decree ordering compliance with an abstract proposition of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b1186-5\">In particular we disagree with the district court that this decree is fatally ambiguous with respect to matters such as (1) whether \u201cflowmeters\u201d are \u201crelated components\u201d; (2) whether paragraph 6 qualifies the absolute prohibitions in paragraphs 1(a) and 1(b); and (3) whether the word \u201cfill\u201d in paragraph 1(f) requires consent prior to shipment of non-AMF products. In reaching the results we do, we are guided by the language of the decree, the circumstances surrounding its formation, and its purposes \u2014 in brief, by the usual considerations of contract interpretation. <em>See United States v. ITT Continental Baking Co., </em>420 U.S. 223, 238, 95 S.Ct. 926, 935, 43 L.Ed.2d 148 (1975). In matters fairly open to debate, we have deferred to the conclusions of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1186-6\">We turn now to the specific allegations of contempt.</p>\n<p id=\"b1186-7\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b1186-8\">1. <em>Directory Listings</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1186-9\">AMF contends that the district court erred in not ruling that various directory and telephone listings which appeared after entry of the decree on September 15, 1977, were in violation thereof. Paragraph 1(b) prohibits defendants from using \u201cPrecision\u201d and \u201cPrecision Chemical Pump Corporation\u201d in connection with the sale, advertisement, or distribution of chemical metering pumps. Notwithstanding this prohibition, the 1978 Thomas Register, a well-known industrial directory, and the Western Union 1980 Telex Buyer\u2019s Guide, both listed Wal-chem under the name \u201cPrecision Chemical Pump Corporation.\u201d The 1980-1981 West Suburban Telephone Directory listed Wal-chem\u2019s telephone number not only under Walchem but under the heading \u201cPrecision Control Products Corp.\u201d And the 1979, 1980 and 1981 Boston Telephone Directories listed Walchem\u2019s number solely under the name \u201cPrecision Chemical Pump Service Company,\u201d with \u201cSee Waltham Chemical Pump Corp.\u201d in smaller print underneath. Insofar as the record reveals, there was no separate directory listing under Waltham Chemical Pump Corp. or the like.</p>\n<p id=\"b1186-10\">Defendants\u2019 explanation for these listings, which continued with the name the decree had ordered them to forego, was that they had appeared in spite of their good faith efforts to eliminate all references to Precision in the various directories. As evidence of their good faith, they pointed to a statement of compliance filed with the court in 1977, shortly after the decree was entered, which included both a letter notifying the New England Telephone Company that Walchem\u2019s \u201ccorporate name\u201d had been changed, and a telex requesting Western Union\u2019s credit department to update its records to reflect the change. Defendants also pointed out that the improper 1978 Thomas Register listing was immediately corrected. And after this contempt proceeding began, defendants at last took definitive steps to eliminate the listings.</p>\n<p id=\"b1186-11\">The district court found that Jewett had not acted in defiance of the decree but had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1103\">*1103</page-number>taken \u201cthe appropriate steps necessary for compliance.\u201d In the cases of Thomas, Western Union and the West Suburban Telephone listings, it found these had appeared despite express instructions to the contrary, and that appropriate and timely corrective measures had been taken. As to the Boston Directory listings in 1979, 1980 and 1981, the court held that these did not suggest that the two companies \u2014 Walchem and Precision Chemical Pump \u2014 were one and the same. The court felt these were no more misleading than certain name change notices allowed under the consent decree.</p>\n<p id=\"b1187-5\">We find no error in the court\u2019s ruling as to Thomas. The record suggests that Jewett had written Thomas early in 1978 protesting the 1978 listing. There is a letter from Thomas around the same time acknowledging that the listing \u201cwas not ordered by you, Mr. Jewett\u201d and would be \u201ckilled\u201d in the future.</p>\n<p id=\"b1187-6\">We have considerably more difficulty with the court\u2019s other rulings on this issue. Walchem\u2019s only action in 1977 regarding Western Union was a telex addressed to its <em>credit department </em>dated September 2, 1977, requesting it to change its records to reflect \u201cour new name,\u201d i.e., Walchem. There was no reference to changing the Buyer\u2019s Guide listing. Presumably the credit department would be concerned only with billing and the like. Predictably, defendant was listed under the prohibited \u201cPrecision\u201d name in the 1980 Buyer\u2019s Guide. Defendants took no determined action until July 28, 1980, two months after this contempt proceeding had been brought, at which time they requested deletion of the old name in future editions of the Buyer\u2019s Guide.</p>\n<p id=\"b1187-8\">Defendants\u2019 conduct was similarly inadequate as to the West Suburban and Boston telephone directory listings. In August 1977 Jewett wrote to the New England Telephone Company\u2019s Arlington office notifying it only that Precision\u2019s corporate name had been changed to Walchem, and that its address and number were unchanged. The letter contained no request for any particular directory action, and the West Suburban directory apparently continued to list the firm under the old Precision name (as well as Walchem) through 1980-1981. Meanwhile, and most flagrantly, the Boston telephone books for 1979, 1980 and 1981 listed the new name merely as a subordinate cross-reference under the Precision name, which continued to be the firm\u2019s primary Boston listing. In 1981, after the contempt motion was brought, defendants for the first time wrote letters to a service representative of the telephone company requesting deletion of the Precision listings in both directories. Why such action was not taken two or more years earlier was not explained.</p>\n<p id=\"b1187-9\">On such a record, we think the district court erred in holding that Walchem and Jewett had taken \u201creasonably appropriate steps necessary for compliance.\u201d The court went on to blame the continued listings on the \u201cmistakes or omissions of the telephone company [and] Western Union.\u201d But the feeble 1977 letters to the telephone company\u2019s Arlington office and to Western Union\u2019s <em>credit office </em>were hardly calculated to effect directory changes. And even assuming defendants felt they were, they were clearly on notice by 1979 and 1980 that their efforts had failed, particularly when the Boston telephone directory continued to list them primarily under the Precision name.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1188-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1104\">*1104</page-number>Paragraph 1(b) outlawed the words \u201cPrecision\u201d and \u201cPrecision Chemical Pump Corporation\u201d in connection with the sale, advertisement or distribution of chemical metering pumps. Paragraph 3 directed defendants to abandon the Precision name. At very least, those provisions called for substantial good faith efforts to see that the Precision name did not appear in a Western Union Buyer\u2019s Guide or in the telephone directories.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We see no ambiguity in this regard, nor was the evidence less than \u201cclear and convincing\u201d that defendants\u2019 actions were below whatever reasonable standard of effort one might infer. There is no scienter requirement for a finding of civil contempt. <em>McComb v. Jacksonville Paper Co., </em>336 U.S. 187, 191, 69 S.Ct. 497, 499, 93 L.Ed. 599 (1949); <em>Commodity Futures Trading Commission v. Premex, Inc., </em>655 F.2d 779, 782 (7th Cir.1981). Even assuming that the court could decline to find contempt had defendants taken all reasonable steps, without success, to comply, we see no basis to find here that defendants came even close to taking reasonable measures. After going through the motions of compliance by writing letters in 1977, defendants sat idly by for the next two years knowing, or having reason to know, that the old name was continuing to be used. We do not think the court could in such circumstances refuse a finding of civil contempt.</p>\n<p id=\"b1188-4\">2. <em>Drop Shipments of Flowmeters</em></p>\n<p id=\"A6m\">AMF contends that the district court erred in refusing to find that Walchem violated the decree by shipping non-AMF \u201cflowmeters\u201d in cartons that were labelled with the prohibited marks POP, AMF, Cuno, and the name Precision. Walchem obtained these flowmeters, devices used as external pacing mechanisms on certain models of pumps, from the same German firm, Hydrometer, that supplies AMF flowmeters. Recognizing that Walchem\u2019s flowmeters were functionally equivalent to their AMF counterparts, Stephen Kalish\u2014 the president of a company, Precision Control Products of Madison, Wisconsin, that was authorized to distribute AMF Precision products \u2014 purchased ten Walchem flowme-ters to fill existing orders from his customers. Kalish then arranged for Walchem to drop-ship them directly to designated downstream purchasers. He provided labels, invoices, and instruction booklets which Wal-chem included with the drop-shipped flowmeters. These shipping papers bore the name Precision Control Products, and the trademarks AMF, Cuno, and PCP \u2014 all marks that Kalish used under the terms of his distribution agreement with AMF when selling AMF products. When the Walchem flowmeters reached Kalish\u2019s customers, they were packaged like AMF Precision flowmeters. While AMF labels were not attached directly to the flowmeter itself, the instruction booklet that accompanied the product read, \u201cAMF, CUNO, Precision Control Products, 200 Series, Flowmeter ... Instructions.\u201d Kalish testified that he did not know what could have told the customer that it was not an AMF Precision flowmeter.</p>\n<p id=\"b1188-7\">AMF points to paragraphs 1(a) and 1(b) of the decree, which it contends, prohibit defendants from using its various marks in connection with the distribution of pumps or \u201crelated components.\u201d AMF argues that flowmeters are \u201crelated components\u201d within the meaning of the decree and that Wal-chem used the prohibited marks in connection with their distribution by inserting Kalish\u2019s labels and booklets into the boxes and shipping them to Kalish\u2019s customers.</p>\n<p id=\"b1188-8\">The district court found no evidence of contempt. The court believed that any prohibition in paragraphs 1(a) and 1(b) against <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1105\">*1105</page-number>defendants\u2019 use of the marks AMF, Cuno, PCP, and Precision extended only to the use of such marks in connection with the distribution of pumps or \u201crelated components.\u201d Thus, the court reasoned, the flowmeter shipments violated the decree only if the parties understood the term \u201crelated components\u201d as including flowmeters. The parties vigorously disputed this issue at trial,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> but the court declined to rule on it definitively. Rather, the court stated that it would be unjust to hold the defendants in contempt for failing to adhere to AMF\u2019s interpretation of an ambiguous term.</p>\n<p id=\"b1189-5\">The court also reasoned that because Kalish knew that <em>his </em>customers were to receive non-AMF products, there was no likelihood of confusion resulting from the flowmeter transactions. Such a finding implicitly reflects the district court\u2019s view that paragraphs 1(a) and 1(b) only prohibit such use of AMF\u2019s trademarks as is likely to cause confusion or mistake among purchasers, an interpretation made explicit in another section of the opinion. The court articulated two reasons for rejecting AMF\u2019s contention that the decree prohibited any use by Walchem of the listed trademarks without regard to the likelihood of resulting confusion. First, the court reasoned that such a construction would run counter to paragraph 6, which authorizes defendants to sell new AMF products with their original labels, bulletins, and literature. Second, the court pointed to what it viewed as an ambiguously worded section of paragraph 1(b) insofar as that paragraph related to defendants\u2019 use of AMF\u2019s marks \u201cSentrol,\u201d \u201cDiaton,\u201d \u201cAMF,\u201d and \u201cCuno.\u201d The court did not explain how this ambiguity justified applying the likely confusion standard to the use of such prohibited marks as Precision and PCP as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b1189-6\">We thus face on appeal the questions whether the district court erred in refusing to rule that flowmeters are related components and in reading paragraphs 1(a) and 1(b) to prohibit only such use of AMF\u2019s marks as is likely to cause confusion. We believe the court erred on both points.</p>\n<p id=\"b1189-9\">We base our conclusion that flow-meters are \u201crelated components\u201d on what seems to us the only meaningful interpretation of the decree. The decree enjoins Walchem from using AMF\u2019s trademarks and trade names in connection with sale of pumps and related components. Because the decree was drafted to protect AMF\u2019s marks, the term \u201crelated components\u201d can be sensibly interpreted only as a broad description of parts, accessories and equipment related to chemical metering pumps. Otherwise the decree would prohibit defendants from using AMF\u2019s marks in connection with one class of products defined as \u201crelated components\u201d while authorizing such use in connection with a second class of products defined as accessories or related equipment. The whole thrust of the decree, however, was that defendants were not to make any use of AMF\u2019s marks, except insofar as such marks appeared on original AMF products resold in their original containers, or on products sent to defendants for servicing. A broad interpretation of the term \u201crelated components\u201d to encompass any part or accessory customarily used in connection with metering pumps finds support in Jewett\u2019s affidavit where he expressed his understanding that the decree prohibited <em>all </em>use of the terms \u201cPCP\u201d and \u201cPrecision.\u201d In arguing now that flowmeters are not related components, Walchem argues essentially that it should have the right to appropriate those marks simply because the term \u201crelated components\u201d may not, technically, include accessories in every circumstance. Plainly, the decree did not anticipate such a fine-spun distinction. Our <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1106\">*1106</page-number>interpretation does not preclude Walchem from selling its own line of flowmeters; it only prohibits the use of AMF\u2019s marks in connection with such sales. Thus, Jewett\u2019s statement that he would not have signed the decree if he had understood it as prohibiting Walchem\u2019s sale of flowmeters has little relevance to the question whether flowmeters are sufficiently identified with chemical metering pumps to be considered related components for purposes of the prohibitions in paragraphs 1(a) and 1(b). They clearly are.</p>\n<p id=\"b1190-4\">The district court also erred in rejecting AMF\u2019s contentions that paragraphs 1(a) and 1(b) prohibit Walchem from using the eight trademarks and service names listed in the decree without regard to the likelihood of resulting confusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1190-5\">That the decree contained paragraph 6\u2014 which allows Walchem to sell new AMF products in their original cartons, and to use AMF literature bearing the Precision trademarks in connection with these sales\u2014 provided no reason for an expanded likelihood-of-confusion standard in paragraph 1(b). Letting Walchem use the Precision trademarks in connection with the sale of genuine AMF products in their original containers was not inconsistent with an otherwise broad directive against use of such trademarks in connection with non-AMF pumps and components.</p>\n<p id=\"b1190-6\">The decree, moreover, flatly prohibited Walchem from using the marks \u201cPCP,\u201d \u201cPrecision,\u201d and \u201cPrecision Chemical Pump Corporation.\u201d As to these marks, there was no justification to imply a likelihood of confusion limitation. Jewett conceded as much in his own testimony. He stated that Wal-chem \u201ccould not as a company use PCP or Precision ... on any of [its] products.\u201d Notably absent from this testimony was any suggestion that the prohibition applied only where confusion was established.</p>\n<p id=\"b1190-7\">With respect to the trademarks Sentrol, Diaton, AMF, and Cuno, the text of paragraph 1(b) is somewhat less specific. It literally bars only the use of words <em>so similar </em>to Sentrol, Diaton, AMF and Cuno as to be likely to cause confusion or mistake, etc. But if words so similar to the four trademarks as to cause confusion or mistake are barred, the implication is strong that use of the marks themselves is barred a fortiori. Not only does the content of the decree as a whole, as well as common sense, support this construction, it is specifically confirmed in paragraph 2. Paragraph 2 directs defendants to surrender for destruction all materials in their possession,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1190-9\">which bear the notations \u201cPCP,\u201d \u201cPrecision,\u201d \u201cPrecision Control Products\u201d or \u201cPrecision Chemical Pump Corporation\u201d or which bear any other simulation of the foregoing trademarks or tradenames, or of plaintiff\u2019s registered trademarks \u201cSen-trol,\u201d \u201cDiaton,\u201d \u201cAMF,\u201d and \u201cCuno,\u201d or which bear <em>any other representation or statement in violation of the injunction.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"aai-dedup-1\">(Emphasis supplied.) Not only does the required destruction of these materials show that the trademarks Sentrol, Diaton, AMF, and Cuno are foreclosed to defendants, the underscored language places them expressly within the class of representations that violate the injunction. We conclude, therefore, that paragraph 1(b) was intended to prohibit the specified uses of the marks Sentrol, Diaton, AMF, and Cuno without regard to the likelihood that confusion will result therefrom.</p>\n<p id=\"b1190-10\">As the term \u201crelated components\u201d included flowmeters, and as the decree prohibited any use by Walchem of the Precision trademarks in connection with the distribution of such components, the drop-shipments violated the decree. And this was no mere technical violation. Jewett and his employees knew that they were to refrain from using the AMF marks \u201cPCP\u201d and \u201cPrecision\u201d in connection with the sale of flowmeters. Jewett admitted as much during his deposition, where he stated that \u201cif we were shipping and billing to a customer as Walchem, [w]e certainly would not have sent that meter out as a Precision meter.\u201d He contended at trial, as he does here, that the drop-shipments were simply ministerial acts performed for the benefit of Kalish and were thus saved from illegality.</p>\n<p id=\"b1191-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1107\">*1107</page-number>Defendants\u2019 attempt to portray themselves as the innocent agents of Kalish cannot be squared with the facts, however. Walchem\u2019s flowmeters were virtually identical to their AMF counterparts and were packed in cartons with Precision shipping labels and AMF Cuno flowmeter instructions. The recipient of such a product could scarcely have suspected it was anything but a genuine Precision flowmeter, as Kalish\u2019s testimony reflects. Walchem not only profited from the deception of downstream purchasers, it played an active role in accomplishing the deceit. As a party under a court order that prohibited it from using the trademarks, Walchem clearly had an obligation to do \u201cmore than show how close it could come with safety to that which [it was] enjoined from doing.\u201d <em>AMF, Inc. v. International Fiberglass Co., </em>469 F.2d 1063, 1065 (1st Cir.1972). Here, defendants adopted the posture of innocence without accepting the obligations of compliance, and we think the district court erred in refusing to find them in contempt.</p>\n<p id=\"b1191-5\">3. <em>Sales Through Precision Distributors</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1191-6\">AMF argues that the district court incorrectly concluded that Walchem had not violated the decree in selling pumps and products from non-AMF sources to authorized Precision distributors, knowing that they would be resold as genuine AMF products. AMF argues essentially that in selling to AMF Precision dealers with knowledge that the products would be resold to less sophisticated downstream purchasers under the Precision name, defendants violated paragraph 1(b) by appropriating the name Precision and its related goodwill in connection with the \u201cdistribution\u201d of chemical metering pumps. To establish that defendants knew that their products would be resold with AMF Precision labels and literature, AMF points both to Jewett\u2019s familiarity with the sales practices of various Precision dealers and to defendants\u2019 use of Precision labels and literature in connection with the flowmeter shipments discussed in the previous section.</p>\n<p id=\"b1191-7\">The district court determined that Wal-chem had sold products from its own sources to authorized AMF dealers but found no violation of the decree. The court observed that to hold defendants responsible for the packaging and labelling practices of AMF distributors would effectively require them to monitor the relationship between distributors and their customers, an obligation that the decree failed to impose on defendants directly. As to an alleged violation of paragraph 1(f), the district court emphasized that the \u201cpurchasers,\u201d as that term is used in the decree, were the dealers, not the eventual downstream recipients. So long as the dealers knew they were receiving non-AMF products, and the court found no evidence that they were misled by Walchem\u2019s practices, defendants were not \u201cpassing off\u201d their products in contravention of paragraph 1(f).</p>\n<p id=\"b1191-8\">We cannot say that the district court committed clear error in not finding a violation of the decree. The evidence was conflicting as to the extent of Walchem\u2019s knowledge of the dealers\u2019 substitution of Walchem products for those of AMF; and it would be necessary, in any event to reach beyond the strict terms of the decree to find Walchem in violation. Just as we do not think a court can ignore obvious violations, it need not reach out for an expansive interpretation. We sustain the district court on this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b1191-9\">4. <em>Name Change Notices</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1191-10\">AMF alleges error in the district court\u2019s refusal to uphold its claim of contempt based on defendants\u2019 practice of appending a Walchem sticker and the notation \u201cNote our new name\u201d when sending back customer queries that incorrectly addressed Walchem as Precision Control Products.</p>\n<p id=\"b1191-11\">AMF argues that these responses falsely implied that Walchem was once named Precision Control Products whereas in fact Precision Control Products was the company Jewett sold to AMF in 1973. AMF claims that it had succeeded to all rights in that and other aspects of the Precision name. AMF contends that Walchem\u2019s practice vio<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1108\">*1108</page-number>lated paragraph 1(b) of the consent decree because it improperly made use of the Precision name in connection with the sale of chemical metering pumps. To bolster its position, AMF points to paragraph 1(b)(iii), which prescribes an explicit form for name-change notices and limits Walchem\u2019s use of such notices to the period ending December 31, 1977.</p>\n<p id=\"b1192-4\">The district court concluded that this conduct did not violate the decree. It observed that the insert prescribed in Exhibit B of the decree was intended to reduce purchaser confusion concerning Walchem\u2019s relationship to AMF Precision. That Walchem had continued to receive correspondence addressed to Precision indicated to the court that this procedure had proved inadequate. Thus, the court concluded that the decree implicitly authorized some continuing efforts on Walchem\u2019s part to inform customers that its name had been changed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1192-5\">While the issue is close, we do not find reversible error. It would be unreasonable to regard the name-change notices approved in paragraph 1(b) as the only ones allowed. Walchem was entitled and indeed expected to eliminate confusion by notifying customers appropriately of its new name. As in the cases of the Western Union and telephone listings, it was improper not to do so. AMF\u2019s attorneys were themselves concerned, when deposing Jew-ett, as to whether he had taken steps to tell customers that Walchem was no longer associated with Precision.</p>\n<p id=\"b1192-6\">It is true that Walchem was less than candid in implying, to the extent it did, that it rather than AMF might be the <em>successor </em>to Precision. But we cannot say the district court exceeded its authority in refusing to find that what was done in these narrow circumstances violated paragraph 1(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b1192-7\">5. <em>Sales of Hybrid Pumps in \u201cAMF CUNO\u201d Boxes Packed with AMF Literature</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1192-8\">AMF appeals from the lower court\u2019s refusal to hold defendants in contempt for selling so-called hybrid pumps to customers in \u201cAMF CUNO\u201d boxes.</p>\n<p id=\"b1192-9\">Defendants\u2019 practice in filling certain orders was to purchase an AMF Precision pump in its original box, to replace the AMF Precision \u201cliquid end\u201d with a Wal-chem liquid end, and to ship the resulting \u201chybrid\u201d pump to a customer in its original \u201cAMF CUNO\u201d box. Walchem\u2019s service personnel taped over AMF\u2019s address on the outside of the box, but they did not cover the marks AMF and CUNO. Labels were attached to the hybrid pumps indicating that Walchem sold and serviced metering pumps and that the pumps had been serviced or rebuilt to correspond to a particular model of the AMF line of pumps. Defendants packed the carton with the AMF Cuno instruction booklet that had accompanied the original pump plus a Walchem parts list and instruction sheet.</p>\n<p id=\"b1192-10\">AMF contends that this practice violated paragraph 1(b) which prohibits defendants from</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1192-11\">applying to or using in connection with the sale, advertisement or distribution of chemical metering pumps or related components ... words so similar to ... any of plaintiff\u2019s other trademarks, i.e., ... \u201cAMF\u201d and \u201cCUNO\u201d as to be likely to cause confusion or mistake or to deceive or to be likely to cause dilution of the distinctive quality of plaintiff\u2019s said trademarks and tradenames ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1192-12\">In finding no violation, the district court ruled that the decree permitted defendants to sell new hybrid pumps composed partly of AMF components. It inferred this from the absence of any prohibition in the decree against such sale, and from paragraph 1(d) and Exhibit D which permitted defendants to apply to the housing of products originally manufactured by plaintiff (AMF) a label of the following description:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1192-13\">WALTHAM Chemical Pump Corp.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1192-14\">1396 Main St., Waltham, MA. 02154</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1192-15\">Serviced or Rebuilt to correspond to</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1192-16\">AMF Model No._</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1192-17\">Serial No._.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1192-18\">Volts _ HZ _ Amps _</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A0V\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1109\">*1109</page-number>The court interpreted use of the term \u201crebuilt\u201d in the above as suggesting \u201cthat defendants are permitted to sell new modified (hybrid) pumps, not just old pumps serviced with AMF parts.\u201d This being so, the court construed paragraph 1(b) as not prohibiting use of the terms \u201cAMF,\u201d \u201cCUNO\u201d and \u201cPrecision Control Products\u201d to describe \u201cthose parts of a hybrid pump which originate with AMF.\u201d The court noted AMF\u2019s \u201cstrong concerns\u201d about defendants\u2019 \u201cpassing off\u201d of its products as their own, and went on to say,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1193-4\">The fact that the decree expressly permits defendants to continue selling and servicing AMF products, along with plaintiff\u2019s strong concerns about \u201cpassing off\u201d strongly suggest that defendants are expected to go out of their way to insure that AMF products are labelled as such.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"aqp-dedup-1\">The court found additional support for its construction in paragraphs 1(c) and 1(g) of the decree. Paragraph 1(c) forbids defendants from \u201clabelling or packaging AMF products so as to appear to have been manufactured by\u201d them, provided they may affix their own label clearly indicating \u201csales or service, but not manufacture,\u201d in the form set forth in Exhibit C. Paragraph 1(g) prohibits defendants from packaging or labelling any AMF product so that plaintiff\u2019s model or part number is used in conjunction with defendants\u2019 name, so as to suggest defendants were the manufacturer or source of origin of the products.</p>\n<p id=\"b1193-5\">In light of the above, and of the wording of paragraph 1(b) itself, the court held that paragraph 1(b) was simply meant to eliminate confusion as to the nature of Wal-chem \u2014 that is, to make clear it was no longer connected with AMF or Precision Control Products \u2014 not to prevent defendants from identifying the origin of AMF pumps and parts. And the court construed paragraph 1(b) as prohibiting use of plaintiff\u2019s marks only insofar as they were likely to cause confusion or mistake, or to deceive purchasers. It found that defendants\u2019 practices with respect to hybrid pumps created no such confusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1193-8\">We do not agree that the decree allows the marketing of hybrid pumps in AMF/CUNO boxes and with AMF/CUNO instruction manuals. Paragraph 1(b) prohibits use of plaintiff\u2019s trademarks, including AMF and CUNO, in connection with the sale or distribution of metering pumps or components.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The district court erred, in our view, in construing the decree to prohibit use of those marks \u201conly insofar as they are likely to cause confusion or mistake, or to deceive purchasers or potential purchasers.\u201d And even were this so, it is hard to see why shipment of a hybrid pump in an AMF carton in this manner would <em>not </em>create a likelihood of confusion or mistake as to the source of the product and its components. The district court justified the practice on the ground that defendants were entitled to identify \u201cthose parts of a hybrid pump which originate with AMF,\u201d but packaging the entire hybrid in a single AMF carton was hardly calculated to identify just those parts which came from AMF.</p>\n<p id=\"b1193-9\">The practice, moreover, is not sanctioned in any exception to the broad strictures of paragraph 1(b). Paragraph 6 allows defendants to sell \u201cnew products of plaintiff,\u201d but requires that they be \u201cshipped in their original containers and with their original labels.\u201d Clearly it would be an unrealistic and strained reading of this provision to hold that it authorized defendants to open the original container, tamper with the AMF product therein, add a new non-AMF part and resell the newly constituted hybrid in the original AMF container.</p>\n<p id=\"b1193-10\">To be sure, paragraph 1(c) \u2014 which forbids \u201cpassing off\u201d plaintiff\u2019s products by misla-belling them, so as to make them appear to have been manufactured by defendants\u2014 allows defendants to affix a label clearly indicating \u201csale or service but not manufacture of said products by said defendants.\u201d And paragraph 1(d) \u2014 which forbids use of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1110\">*1110</page-number>plaintiffs model numbers on products not manufactured by plaintiff \u2014 allows defendants to use plaintiffs model numbers \u201cin the space indicated in a label in the form annexed hereto as Exhibit D applied to the housing of products originally manufactured by plaintiff whether or not those products contain components not supplied by plaintiff.\u201d Exhibit D, already described, is a label indicating the pump was \u201cServiced or Rebuilt to correspond to AMF Model No.__\u201d But these labels are most reasonably explained as contemplating that defendants would engage in sales and service, including rebuilding of used pumps. There is nothing in the decree to suggest that defendants were being authorized to construct modified pumps out of a mixture of new AMF and Walchem components, and then sell them as new pumps in AMF cartons but with labels indicating they had been rebuilt by defendants. To the contrary, the limitations in paragraph 6, and the language in paragraphs 1(c) and (g) prohibiting defendants from holding themselves out as \u201cmanufacturer\u201d or \u201csource of origin\u201d of AMF products, all tend to militate against such a practice. And paragraph 1(b), as noted, broadly prohibits the use of the AMF/CUNO marks in connection with the sale of any metering pumps \u2014 subject only to the exceptions noted. As the obvious purpose of the decree is to prevent defendants from misappropriating plaintiffs trademarks and confusing the public as to the source of products, one would expect clear authorization in the decree before implying an exception for a practice of this sort.</p>\n<p id=\"b1194-5\">In normal parlance, moreover, the term \u201crebuilt\u201d refers to a used product that has been reconditioned with new or used parts or components. Use of the term here, in conjunction with the term \u201cserviced\u201d (and in a decree limiting defendants to sales and service of AMF products, but not manufacture), strengthens that construction. Had that part of the decree been intended to license the manufacture and sale of a line of new, modified \u201chybrid\u201d pumps packaged under one of AMF\u2019s trade names, it could have said so. The single reference to a rebuilt pump in Exhibit D, allied as it was with defendants\u2019 servicing role, is not enough to have created an exception to the broad prohibition contained in paragraph 1(b).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1194-8\">Moreover, defendants\u2019 labelling and packaging practices here were inappropriate. Defendants were obliged to eliminate as much as possible any prospect of customer confusion. They contend that the carton in which these pumps were shipped truthfully advised the recipient that an AMF product was to be found inside as required in paragraphs 1(c) and 1(g). But the carton nowhere explained its contents in a manner that would adequately inform a customer that the pump was composed of both AMF and Walchem components. Rather, the box bore the terms \u201cAMF, CUNO\u201d and Wal-ehem\u2019s address label, packaging hardly calculated to inform customers that the product inside was a hybrid much less to distinguish Walchem from AMF \u2014 a prime objective of the decree.</p>\n<p id=\"b1194-9\">We hold that the district court erred in ruling that defendants\u2019 above-described practice in regard to hybrid pumps was not violative of the consent decree.</p>\n<p id=\"b1194-10\">6. <em>Walchem\u2019s Use of AMF Model Numbers</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1194-11\">AMF argues that the district court erred in concluding that the decree did not prohibit Walchem from using AMF Precision model numbers to describe chemical metering pumps. Paragraph 1(d) of the decree prohibits defendants from,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"auv-dedup-0\">using any model number identical to a model number of plaintiff\u2019s or confusingly similar thereto so as to be likely to cause confusion or mistake or to deceive or to cause dilution of the distinctive quality of said model number to describe any product which is not manufactured by plaintiff or any product originally <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1111\">*1111</page-number>manufactured by plaintiff but containing parts or components not manufactured by plaintiff.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1195-5\">AMF argues initially that Walchem violated this provision by listing AMF model numbers in its catalog and filling customer orders for such models with Walchem hybrid pumps. When coupled with the catalog listings, this practice of substituting Walchem pumps resulted, AMF contends, in the use of AMF model numbers to describe a product that, at the time of shipping, was not a genuine Precision pump. AMF characterizes this substitution practice as a bait and switch operation in which Walchem induced customers to order genuine AMF products with the AMF model numbers and then filled the resulting orders with hybrid pumps. AMF also contends that Walchem used model numbers to describe its own brand of pumps that were confusingly similar to the numbers used by AMF.</p>\n<p id=\"b1195-6\">The district court found no violation. Addressing AMF\u2019s first argument, the court explained that paragraph 6 authorized defendants to sell genuine AMF products and that paragraph 1(d) authorized the use of AMF model numbers to describe such products. Thus, the catalog listings in themselves did not violate the decree. The court acknowledged that on occasion Wal-chem would substitute its own hybrid pumps, but it declined to link these shipments of Walchem products to the catalog listings. Certain substitution practices, the court reasoned, were expressly authorized by a proviso in paragraph 1(f); thus, defendants were not using AMF model numbers to \u201cdescribe\u201d non-AMF products by listing the Precision pumps in the catalog and substituting hybrid pumps.</p>\n<p id=\"b1195-7\">We would agree with the district court that insofar as defendants\u2019 substitution practices were occasional or isolated, the use of AMF model numbers to describe AMF products did not violate the decree. Defendants stocked a quantity of AMF products with which to fill orders for Precision pumps, but they conceded that on occasion they filled orders for AMF pumps with Walchem hybnu pumps. Walchem\u2019s service representative, Mr. Presseau, estimated in his affidavit that the rate of substitution ranged from as low as five percent for the most frequently sold AMF models to as high as thirty percent for other models. With respect to models where substitutions of only this frequency were shown we believe the district court was entitled to find that the AMF model numbers in the catalog were not being used to describe products other than those manufactured by plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b1195-9\">Where substitutions took place routinely, however, the use of AMF model numbers in the catalog violated the decree because the numbers did not describe AMF products. Presseau indicated that AMF code \u201c07\u201d and \u201c21\u201d liquid handling ends were not generally available to Walchem. This statement by Walchem\u2019s employee suggests that when a customer ordered an AMF pump with an \u201c07\u201d or \u201c21\u201d liquid end, Walchem frequently and perhaps typically substituted a hybrid pump.</p>\n<p id=\"b1195-10\">We also disagree with the district court\u2019s conclusion that the model numbers used by Walchem to describe its own pumps were not confusingly similar to their AMF counterparts. A typical AMF model number consists of five elements, each of which describes a separate feature of the pump. The first element, the \u201cseries\u201d number, describes the drive assembly component of the pump. AMF series numbers range from \u201cH1000\u201d to \u201cH5000\u201d and from \u201c6000\u201d to \u201c15,000,\u201d varying in increments of 1,000. Thus, the drive assembly in an \u201c8000\u201d series pump differs from that in a \u201c9000\u201d series pump. The second element of the system, a two-digit number, describes the liquid handling end, which, together with the drive assembly, makes up the pump. As an illustration, consider the AMF model number \u201c8311-11.\u201d The digit \u201c8\u201d identifies the drive assembly as part of the \u201c8000\u201d series. The second two digits, \u201c31,\u201d identify the liquid handling end as an AMF code \u201c31\u201d component. The final three digits describe other features of the pump. The digit \u201c1\u201d at the end of the \u201c8311\u201d identifies the pump as a single-headed pump, in contrast to a double-headed pump, in which case the last <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1112\">*1112</page-number>digit would be a <em>\u201c2.\u201d </em>The first digit of the \u201c-11\u201d indicates the speed of the pump \u2014 \u201c1\u201d signifying a low and <em>\u201c2\u201d </em>signifying a high-speed pump. The second digit of the \u201c-11,\u201d \u201c1,\u201d indicates 115 volts; a <em>\u201c2\u201d </em>would indicate 230 volts.</p>\n<p id=\"b1196-4\">Walchem adopted a similar five-element numbering system to describe its hybrid pumps. The Walchem system was identical to the AMF system except that Walchem described its own liquid handling ends with two-digit codes that differed from their AMF counterparts. Walchem\u2019s catalog, for example, lists a model \u201c8481-11\u201d metering pump. This pump consists of an \u201c8000\u201d series AMF drive assembly and a code \u201c48\u201d Walchem liquid handling end; the final three digits convey the same information as the corresponding digits in an AMF model number. Walchem\u2019s catalog groups AMF pumps together with Walchem pumps and displays them under a common heading according to the \u201cseries\u201d of the drive assembly. For example, an AMF model \u201c9211-11\u201d is listed directly above a Walchem model \u201c9451-11\u201d and both pumps are grouped under the heading \u201c9000 Series.\u201d Thus, in scanning down the list of pumps in Wal-chem\u2019s catalog, the only way to distinguish AMF pumps from Walchem pumps is to determine whether the liquid handling end code refers to an AMF or a Walchem product.</p>\n<p id=\"b1196-5\">The district court concluded that the model numbers Walchem used to describe its hybrid pumps were not confusingly similar to those of AMF. Characterizing the defendants\u2019 system as \u201clegitimate and useful,\u201d the court observed that the use of different codes to describe Walchem\u2019s liquid ends would alert customers that the pumps listed under Walchem\u2019s numbers had not been produced by AMF. In the court\u2019s view, any purchaser sophisticated enough to rely solely on Walchem\u2019s numbering system in ordering pumps would understand the meaning of the system. Other less experienced customers would find the model numbers completely unilluminating and would not base a decision to purchase an expensive pump on the model number alone.</p>\n<p id=\"b1196-6\">The court\u2019s conclusion assumes, incorrectly we think, that speculation as to the sophistication of some customers precluded a finding of confusion where, as here, the two numbering systems were virtually identical. The universe of prospective purchasers cannot be neatly divided into those whose familiarity Iwith the AMF numbering system enables them to distinguish AMF model numbers from Walchem numbers and those whose ignorance prevents them from referring to model numbers altogether. The evidence suggested that Walchem distributed its catalogs to over 100 customers; it can hardly be assumed that each recipient fell squarely into one of the two camps. The simple fact that Walchem\u2019s numbering system \u2014 by incorporating AMF\u2019s series number, by using a two-digit number to describe liquid ends, and by using the last three digits to convey information concerning the speed and voltage of the pump\u2014 was effectively identical to AMF\u2019s numbering system compelled a finding of likely confusion and a conclusion that the use of such numbers violated the decree. We hold that the district court erred insofar as it found Walchem free from contempt with respect to use of its numbering system.</p>\n<p id=\"b1196-7\">7. <em>Walchem\u2019s Use of AMF Part Numbers</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1196-8\">AMF argues that the district court erred in upholding defendants\u2019 practice of listing parts obtained from non-AMF sources as substitutes for AMF Precision parts. Paragraph 1(e) of the decree prohibits defendants \u201cfrom describing or marking any replacement part for plaintiff\u2019s products not manufactured by plaintiff by any designation other than the substitute part number shown in the List of Substitute Part Numbers.\u201d The List of Substitute Part Numbers adverted to in the decree was compiled by AMF and delivered to defendants shortly after the decree was entered; it lists every AMF part number and a corresponding Walchem number for each such part. Thus, paragraph 1(e) by its terms prohibits Walchem from \u201cdescribing or marking\u201d replacement parts by any designation other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1113\">*1113</page-number>than the Walchem numbers provided in the List of Substitute Part Numbers.</p>\n<p id=\"b1197-5\">AMF argues that the listings in Wal-chem\u2019s catalogs, price lists, and invoices violate paragraph 1(e) because AMF part numbers are used to \u201cdescribe\u201d the Walchem part. AMF points, for illustrative purposes, to the parts price list in Walchem\u2019s catalog which lists Walchem parts under the heading \u201cWalchem Part No.\u201d Adjacent to the Walchem number, the catalog listed the AMF Precision part number under the heading \u201cReplaces Part No.\u201d By explicitly representing the Walchem part to be a replacement for its Precision counterpart, AMF argues, defendants were \u201cdescribing or marking\u201d the part in violation of the decree.</p>\n<p id=\"b1197-6\">The district court determined that paragraph 1(e) does not clearly prohibit Wal-chem from including a \u201ccross-reference\u201d to the corresponding AMF part. Such cross-references, the court reasoned, did not suggest that the parts are identical but only that Walchem\u2019s parts substitute for or replace those of AMF. The court concluded that the cross-references do not further purchaser confusion as to the origin of the part but rather help purchasers identify the part they seek to buy.</p>\n<p id=\"b1197-7\">We agree with the district court that paragraph 1(e) does not clearly prohibit the use of AMF part numbers as cross-references. To begin with, paragraph 1(e) does not \u2014 as it might have \u2014 prohibit all use of AMF parts numbers but only the use of the numbers to \u201cdescribe or mark\u201d Walchem\u2019s products. Thus the provision differs from paragraphs 1(a) and 1(b) which flatly proscribe use of the AMF trademarks listed. We find this distinction important in view of the fact that paragraph 1(e) was plainly intended, as AMF has admitted, to authorize Walchem to sell replacement parts. It is difficult to imagine Walchem selling replacement parts without referring in advertisements or invoices to the AMF part number to be replaced. The more sensible interpretation of paragraph 1(e) \u2014 and the one the district court adopted \u2014 is that it prohibits Walchem from describing replacement parts in a manner that confusingly suggests that the parts were produced by AMF. The testimony of William Reilly, the executive in charge of AMF Precision, implicitly supports this interpretation. He testified that he had learned, during the period when the consent decree was originally negotiated, that Walchem had been passing off its own parts under AMF labels. This concern with passing off suggests that paragraph 1(e) was intended to prevent Walchem from unfairly labelling its parts so as to mislead purchasers as to their origin. We therefore find no error in the district court\u2019s conclusion that the defendants did not violate the decree in listing their parts as substitutes for those of AMF.</p>\n<p id=\"b1197-9\">8. <em>Walchem\u2019s Substitution Practices</em></p>\n<p id=\"azi-dedup-0\">AMF argues that the district court incorrectly interpreted paragraph 1(f) to permit defendants to ship Walchem products to customers who had ordered genuine Precision products without first obtaining the purchaser\u2019s consent to the substitution. Paragraph 1(f) prohibits defendants</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ABb6\">from filling any order for a product described in any way by reference to, or use of the words, \u201cDIATON,\u201d \u201cSENTROL,\u201d \u201cAMF,\u201d or \u201cPRECISION,\u201d either alone or in combination with other words, or by reference to plaintiff\u2019s part number or model number for the desired product, except with new products manufactured by plaintiff, unless the purchaser changes the order orally or in writing.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1197-10\">Walchem\u2019s practice under this provision has evolved in the years since the decree was entered. Initially, upon receiving an order referring to Precision parts, models, or trademarks, Walchem\u2019s customer service representatives telephoned the customer, explained that they proposed to ship non-AMF goods, and obtained the customer\u2019s consent to the substitution. In mid-1978, citing the expense and delay associated with this procedure, Walchem adopted instead what the parties have referred to as an \u201cacknowledgement procedure.\u201d From the date of its adoption in July 1978 until defendants altered the practice in 1980 at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1114\">*1114</page-number>AMF\u2019s insistence, Walchem\u2019s customer service representatives <em>no </em>longer telephoned the customer to obtain his consent to the substitution. Instead, a Walchem employee would photocopy the order form, indicate in writing that he planned to substitute Wal-chem products for one or more of the AMF products that had been ordered, and send this notice of substitution to the customer. The goods were shipped without waiting for the customer to respond, often within a few days. There was no practice of waiting for or seeking the customer\u2019s oral or written approval of the substitution. Walchem treated acceptance and payment for the goods as sufficient change of the original order.</p>\n<p id=\"b1198-4\">The district court found that the \u201cac-knowledgement procedure\u201d did not violate the decree. The court first emphasized the provision\u2019s ambiguity, stating that it \u201cdoes not, as it might have, specify that defendants must obtain the required consent before filling their orders, or that orders are .\u2018filled\u2019 upon shipment.\u201d The court went on to observe that the more logical interpretation, the one suggested by Walchem, \u201cis that an order is not \u2018filled\u2019 until the purchaser accepts delivery of it, particularly if it has not yet been paid for.\u201d Finally, the court observed that AMF had produced no evidence of customer dissatisfaction or deception.</p>\n<p id=\"b1198-5\">We agree with AMF that the district court erred in adopting Walchem\u2019s interpretation of the word \u201cfilled\u201d and in refusing to find that the procedure used violated the decree. There is no support for the district court\u2019s conclusion that ambiguity surrounded the meaning of the word \u201cfilled.\u201d To the contrary, we think paragraph 1(f) can only sensibly be interpreted, as AMF contends, to prohibit substitutions unless consent is manifested prior to shipment of the substitute. Paragraph 1(f) was intended, as the parties agree, to prohibit defendants from passing off non-AMF goods as genuine AMF Precision products. This prohibition loses its force if it is construed to permit Walchem to ship nonconforming goods without having secured the customers\u2019 consent. The provision contains no qualifying language and the absence of any evidence of customer dissatisfaction is irrelevant.</p>\n<p id=\"b1198-7\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1198-8\">We conclude that the district court erred in holding defendants free from contempt in connection with the practices discussed in subsections (1), (2), (5), (6) (except as indicated therein), and (8) of section III. The judgment below is reversed in all such instances, and the case is remanded with directions to enter findings of contempt as to each such matter and for further proceedings not inconsistent herewith, including assessment of any appropriate damages. The judgment is otherwise affirmed as to the practices considered in subsections (3), (4), and (7) of section III.</p>\n<p id=\"b1198-9\">\n<em>Reversed in part, affirmed in part and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1198-10\">APPENDIX</p>\n<p id=\"b1198-11\">United States District Court District of Massachusetts</p>\n<p id=\"as3-dedup-0\">Civil Action No. 77-1411-F</p>\n<p id=\"ajh-dedup-0\">AMF Incorporated, Plaintiff, vs. Raymond L.

Freedman U.S.D.J.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1187-7\">. Jean Quong, a customer service representative at Walchem who handled telephone orders and correspondence, testified that she only became aware of the Boston listing after the contempt proceeding, when a customer called expecting to speak to the representatives of a company named Precision. Quong then checked the phone book, discovered the listing, and discussed the matter with Jewett and another customer service representative, Paul Olofson. If this testimony was intended to suggest that no one at Walchem \u2014 located in Greater Boston a few miles from Boston proper \u2014 had found out for over two years that Wal-chem was listed as Precision in the Boston directory, we would regard this as incredible. And even assuming this were so, plaintiff, after settlement of its lawsuit and with the benefit of a consent decree, was entitled to a greater level of responsibility on defendants\u2019 part.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1188-5\">. That Walchem\u2019s telephone listing was to be in that name solely, and not in the Precision name, is underscored by clause (iv) of paragraph 1(b) which specifically granted Walchem a period of one year \u2014 through August 30, 1978 \u2014during which directory assistance operators would be allowed to respond to requests for the telephone number of Precision Chemical Pump Corporation by informing callers that the name had been changed to Waltham Chemical Pump Corporation (Walchem), and to give them Wal-chem\u2019s number. This would make no sense at all if Walchem could continue with the listings here in issue.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1189-7\">. At trial, the director of AMF\u2019s Precision pump division testified that the model \u201c17,000\u201d Precision pump was inoperable without a flowmeter, making a flowmeter a component of that particular pump. AMF also introduced a dictionary entry defining \u201ccomponent\u201d as \u201ca simple part or a relatively complex entity regarded as a part, system, [of] element.\u201d Finally, AMF introduced evidence that both parties listed flowmeters as \u201cparts,\u201d a term that it contended was synonymous with \u201ccomponents.\u201d Walchem argued that flowmeters were \u201caccessories\u201d to and not \u201ccomponents\u201d of chemical metering pumps. Jewett so testified, pointing to AMF\u2019s catalog which listed flowme-ters as \u201caccessories.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1193-6\">. While paragraph 1(b) speaks literally only of prohibiting use of words <em>so similar to </em>the marks \u201cAMF\u201d and \u201cCUNO\u201d as to be likely to cause confusion or mistake or deceive, etc., we have already held, in section 2, above, that the provision a fortiori prohibits use of the very trademarks themselves.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1194-6\">. Plaintiffs counsel took the position during his opening argument below that Exhibit D was inserted into the decree to accommodate Jew-ett\u2019s concern that AMF labels on used pumps were often obscured by wear.
