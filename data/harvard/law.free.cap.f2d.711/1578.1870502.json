Sims asks review of the final order (September 28, 1982) of the Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB or board) denying him attorney fees for litigation before the MSPB. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1662-21\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b1662-22\">Sims, a civilian employee of the Department of the Navy, was removed on August 31, 1979 from his position as an instrument mechanic at the Naval Weapons Support Center in Crane, Indiana.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On appeal to the MSPB, he admitted the substance of the charges but maintained that the penalty of removal was too harsh. The MSPB\u2019s presiding official sustained the agency removal action in an initial decision on November 20, 1979. On review by the board itself, the MSPB mitigated the removal to a 10-day suspension, finding that the presiding official\u2019s analysis was in conflict with its decision in <em>Douglas v. Veterans Administration, </em>5 MSPB 313 (1981), because \u201cthe record here fails to demonstrate that the agency <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1579\">*1579</page-number>considered the consistency of the penalty it imposed on appellant with those imposed upon other employees for similar offenses\u201d, even though his \u201cmisconduct was premeditated and cannot be condoned.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1663-5\">Sims subsequently was denied an award of the attorney fees incurred in these actions, first by the presiding official and then by the board on review, on the basis that no entitlement to attorney fees was established under either the Back Pay Act, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 5596(b), or the Civil Service Reform Act, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7701(g)(1). The board agreed with the presiding official that an award was not \u201cwarranted in the interest of justice\u201d under the Civil Service Reform Act because \u201cthe agency\u2019s action was not \u2018clearly without merit,\u2019 \u201d <em>see Allen v. U.S. Postal Service, </em>2 MSPB 582 (1980), and that entitlement under the Back Pay Act was to be measured by the same \u201cinterest of justice\u201d standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b1663-6\">Petitioner claims the MSPB erred in denying him the fees because (1) an award of attorney fees is mandated by the Back Pay Act without reference to the \u201cinterest of justice\u201d standard of section 7701(g) of the Civil Service Reform Act, (2) alternatively, the award is \u201cwarranted in the interest of justice\u201d, and (3) the amount of fees requested is reasonable. We deal in turn with the first two points; it is unnecessary to reach the third.</p>\n<p id=\"b1663-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b1663-8\">Although a purely facial examination of the Back Pay Act suggests some support for petitioner\u2019s position on that piece of legislation, a more thorough look in light of the legislative history indicates otherwise. Provision for attorney fees was added to the relief previously available under the Back Pay Act by the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978, Pub.L. No. 95-454, \u00a7 702, 92 Stat. 1111, 1216 (codified at 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 5596(b)(l)(A)(ii) (Supp. V 1981)). Section 5596(b)(l)(A)(ii) in pertinent part now states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1663-9\">(b)(1) An employee of an agency who, on the basis of a timely appeal or an administrative determination (including a decision relating to an unfair labor practice or a grievance) is found by appropriate authority under applicable law, rule, regulation, or collective bargaining agreement, to have been affected by an unjustified or unwarranted personnel action which has resulted in the withdrawal or reduction of all or part of the pay, allowances, or differentials of the employee\u2014 (A) is entitled, on correction of the personnel action, for the period for which the personnel action was in effect\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1663-12\">* * \u00a3 * * ;{:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1663-13\">(ii) reasonable attorney fees related to the personnel action which, with respect to any decision relating to an unfair labor practice or a grievance processed under a procedure negotiated in accordance with Chapter 71 of this title, or under Chapter 11 of Title I of the Foreign Service Act of 1980, shall be awarded with standards established under Section 7701(g) of this title; and ...</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1663-14\">Petitioner contends that this section establishes two different standards for the award of attorney fees in back pay cases in which an employee meets the criteria set out in subsection (b)(1). In those cases \u201cwhich, with respect to any decision relating to an unfair labor practice or a grievance processed under a procedure negotiated in accordance with Chapter 71 of this title, or under Chapter 11 of Title I of the Foreign Service Act of 1980,\u201d reasonable attorney fees \u201cshall be awarded\u201d in accordance with 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7701(g)(1) of the Civil Service Reform Act. Section 7701 regulates the MSPB\u2019s appellate procedures. Under \u00a7 7701(g)(1), the board <em>\u201cmay </em>require payment by the agency involved of reasonable attorney fees incurred by an employee or applicant for employment if the employee or applicant is the prevailing party\u201d when the board determines that \u201cpayment by the agency is <em>warranted in the interest of justice, </em>including any case in which a prohibitive personnel practice was engaged in by the agency or any case in which the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1580\">*1580</page-number>agency\u2019s action was clearly without merit.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1664-4\">In all other Back Pay Act cases, Sims says, the provision requires that \u201cthe employee \u2014 is <em>entitled ... </em>\u2014 [to] reasonable attorney fees....\u201d, without any qualification. (Emphasis added.) Thus, he argues, because his case does not involve a \u201cdecision relating to an unfair labor practice.... \u201d (or other specified type), he is entitled to the award of reasonable attorney fees without regard to the \u201cinterest of justice\u201d standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b1664-5\">We disagree with this reading of the statute. First of all, the statutory language is not unequivocal; the wording of \u00a7 5596(b)(l)(A)(ii), <em>supra, </em>does not clearly restrict the application of the \u201cinterest of justice\u201d standard under \u00a7 7701(g)(1) to decisions relating to unfair labor practices, etc. The Pay Act\u2019s attorney fees provision does not state that fees are to be awarded according to that standard <em>only </em>\u201cwith respect to\u201d any decision relating to unfair labor practices, etc. It simply says \u201c... with respect to ... \u201d, which could be interpreted to mean \u201cincluding, but not limited to ...\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b1664-6\">Absent any other indication of the meaning of this ambiguous provision, petitioner\u2019s interpretation would not be unreasonable. But the legislative history demonstrates that Congress clearly intended awards of attorney fees under both provisions to be guided by the same \u201cinterest of justice\u201d standard. The Conference Report on the Civil Service Reform Act discussed this issue as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1664-7\">The Senate bill authorizes attorneys\u2019 fees to be awarded in appeals cases by a hearing officer whenever the employee prevails and the officer determines that the agency\u2019s action was taken in bad faith or in cases where a discrimination under the Civil Rights Amendment of 1964 has occurred.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1664-8\">The House amendment authorizes attorneys\u2019 fees in any case where the officer determines that payment \u201cis warranted\u201d or in a case involving a discrimination under the Civil Rights Amendment of 1964.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"adi-dedup-1\"><em>The conference substitute (Sections 7701(g) and 5596(b)(l)(A)(ii)) authorizes attorneys\u2019 fees in cases where employee prevails on the merits and the deciding official determines that attorneys\u2019 fees are warranted in the interest of justice, </em>including a case involving a prohibitive personnel practice or where the agency\u2019s action was clearly without merit. The reference to these two types of cases is illustrative only and does not limit the official from awarding attorneys\u2019 fees in other kinds of cases.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1664-11\">H.R.Conf.Rep. No. 1717, 95th Cong., 2d Sess. 142 (1978), reprinted in 4 U.S.Cong. and Admin.News 2723, 2876 (1978) (emphasis added). (Note the express reference in the report to section 5596(b)(l)(A)(ii), the very Back Pay Act provision we are interpreting.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1664-12\">Even if we were to agree with petitioner that there is no apparent ambiguity in the words of \u00a7 5596, it would be appropriate to review the legislative history, as we have done here, to be certain of Congress\u2019 intent. As noted in <em>Train v. Colorado Public Interest Research Group, </em>426 U.S. 1, 10, 96 S.Ct. 1938, 1942, 48 L.Ed.2d 434 (1976):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1664-13\">\u201cWhen aid to construction of the meaning of words, as used in the statute, is available, there certainly can be no \u2018rule of law\u2019 which forbids its use, however clear the words may appear on \u2018superficial examination.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. American Trucking Ass\u2019ns., </em>310 U.S. 534, 543-544, 60 S.Ct. 1059, 1064, 84 L.Ed. 1345 (1940) (footnotes omitted). <em>See Cass v. United States, </em>417 U.S. 72, 77-79, 94 S.Ct. 2167, 2170-2171, 40 L.Ed.2d 668 (1974). See generally Murphy, Old Maxims Never Die: The \u201cPlain Meaning Rule\u201d and Statutory Interpretation in the \u201cModern\u201d Federal Courts, 75 Col.L.Rev. 1299 (1975).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1664-14\">The District of Columbia Circuit likewise has recently given weight to this same Back Pay Act legislative history. In <em>Crowley v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1581\">*1581</page-number><em>Schultz, </em>704 F.2d 1269, 1274 (D.C.Cir.1983), that court held that the \u201cSavings Clause\u201d of the Civil Service Reform Act applies to that part of the Reform Act which grants attorney fees in Back Pay Act cases <em>(i.e., </em>\u00a7 5596(b)(l)(A)(ii)) as well as cases falling under \u00a7 7701(g).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> At issue was whether this provision required reversal of the district court\u2019s grant of Crowley\u2019s request for attorney fees in a Back Pay Act action that was commenced prior to passage of the Act. The district court had reasoned that the savings provision did not apply to Back Pay Act cases, and had awarded attorney fees on the theory \u2014 now espoused by petitioner Sims here \u2014 that \u00a7 5596(b)(1)(A)(ii) mandated such an award without qualification.</p>\n<p id=\"b1665-5\">In reversing the district court, the Court of Appeals concluded that \u201c[t]here is no reason to suppose that .. . judicial relief under the Back Pay Act, should be treated any differently\u201d from relief under \u00a7 7701(g). The court supported its holding with a discussion of the same legislative history which we have quoted above, noting that \u201c[w]e find no reason to treat differently provisions which analytically fit together and which Congress considered together.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>Crowley, </em>704 F.2d at 1274. <em>See also Wells v. Harris, </em>2 MSPB 572, 574-575 (1980) (applying the legislative history to the board\u2019s interpretation of the two attorney fee provisions); 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 550.806 (1982) (regulation prescribed by the Office of Personnel Management, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 5596(c), which adopts the \u201cinterest of justice\u201d standard for \u00a7 5596(b)(1)(A)(ii)).</p>\n<p id=\"b1665-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b1665-7\">The remaining question is whether the board erred in denying petitioner an award of attorney fees under the \u201cinterest of justice\u201d standard.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In <em>Allen v. United States Postal Service, </em>2 MSPB 582 (1980), the board analyzed the legislative history of 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7701(g)(1) and offered the following summary of illustrative, but not exhaustive, \u201ccircumstances considered to reflect \u2018the interest of justice\u2019\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1665-10\">1. Where the agency engaged in a \u201cprohibited personnel practice\u201d (\u00a7 7701(g)(1));</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1665-11\">2. Where the agency\u2019s action was \u201cclearly without merit\u201d (\u00a7 7701(g)(1)), or was \u201cwholly unfounded,\u201d or the employee is \u201csubstantially innocent\u201d of the charges brought by the agency;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1665-12\">3. Where the agency initiated the action against the employee in \u201cbad faith,\u201d including:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1665-13\">a. Where the agency\u2019s action was brought to \u201charass\u201d the employee;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1665-14\">b. Where the agency\u2019s action was brought to \u201cexert improper pressure on the employee to act in certain ways\u201d;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1665-15\">4. Where the agency committed a \u201cgross procedural error\u201d which \u201cprolonged the proceeding\u201d or \u201cseverely prejudiced\u201d the employee;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1665-16\">5. Where the agency \u201cknew or should have known that it would not prevail on the merits\u201d when it brought the proceeding.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1665-17\"><em>Allen, </em>2 MSPB at 593.</p>\n<p id=\"b1665-18\">Petitioner urges that his case falls within those contemplated by this standard because his punishment was mitigated, and also because the record shows that the employing agency knew or should have known that it would not prevail on the merits. He seems to be arguing that because the pun<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1582\">*1582</page-number>ishment was mitigated from one which the agency knew or should have known would not be upheld, the agency should be responsible for his attorney fees in having prolonged the matter. We agree, however, with the presiding official and the board that petitioner\u2019s circumstances do not warrant an award of attorney fees.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1666-4\">That the employee\u2019s punishment was mitigated from removal to a 10-day suspension does not, in itself, strike us as a circumstance which warrants \u2014 in the interest of justice \u2014 an award of attorney fees, particularly because he admits the wrongdoing which gave rise to the mitigated penalty. The agency\u2019s adverse action was not \u201cclearly without merit,\u201d and it concerned indisputably improper conduct. There is insufficient evidence, moreover, that the agency knew or should have known it would not prevail. To say that the agency did not succeed in removing petitioner is not to say that it did not \u201cprevail on the merits\u201d. There was never any question regarding the merits of the agency\u2019s case, the substance of which petitioner has admitted. If there were indications of bad faith or ill will by the agency in attempting to remove petitioner our conclusion might differ, but the mitigation in penalty occurred because of something the agency could not have known at the time of petitioner\u2019s hearing. In reducing the sanction, the board applied a standard derived from its April 10, 1981 decision in <em>Douglas v. Veterans Administration, </em>5 MSPB 313, which requires that the agency demonstrate consistency in the imposition of penalties on employees charged with similar offenses. We cannot say that the agency knew or should have known in 1979, when the adverse action was initiated, the substance of a 1981 MSPB decision or that it would be applied retroactively to petitioner\u2019s case.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1666-6\">In this case, there was no finding of a prohibitive personnel practice. Moreover, the agency\u2019s action was not \u201cclearly without merit\u201d since both of its charges were sustained and appellant was given a relatively severe first disciplinary penalty of a 10-day suspension. This disciplinary penalty was imposed after the Board specifically noted the \u201cpremeditated\u201d nature of appellant\u2019s action. Appellant was clearly not, therefore, \u201csubstantially innocent\u201d of the charges against him. In addition, there is no evidence the agency brought its action against the appellant in bad faith, that it intentionally prolonged the proceedings, or that it brought the case in an attempt to harass appellant.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1666-9\">That the agency knew or should have known it would not prevail is evidenced\u2014 petitioner claims \u2014 by the agency\u2019s having \u201cpiled on\u201d charges in order to gain his removal. This is said to have occurred in the agency\u2019s argument before the presiding official, who stated in his initial decision that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1583\">*1583</page-number>Petitioner points out that he was charged, not with criminal or dishonest conduct, but with fraudulent use of a government document and misuse of government time.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"asr-dedup-1\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1582\">*1582</page-number>the agency argued that the fact the appellant had not removed the item from the station did not excuse his actions, which, in view of the element of fraud, were tantamount to criminal or dishonest conduct. Referencing the table of penalties, the agency advised that criminal or dishonest conduct, first offense or otherwise, was a proper basis for removal.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1667-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1583\">*1583</page-number>We have difficulty with the position that this constitutes an incorrect \u201cpiling on\u201d of charges. The statement that petitioner\u2019s actions were \u201ctantamount to\u201d criminal or dishonest conduct is not the same as saying he was technically \u201ccharged\u201d with just such conduct. It is plain that, as the presiding official said, petitioner\u2019s conduct was \u201cdishonest conduct\u201d; he obtained the switchbox for his own use by fraudulently using a government purchase document.</p>\n<p id=\"b1667-6\">Furthermore, petitioner\u2019s reliance on <em>O\u2019Donnell v. Department of Interior, </em>2 MSPB 604 (1980), as substantiation of his contention that such piling on constitutes agency knowledge that its case was without merit, is misplaced. In <em>O\u2019Donnell </em>the board affirmed the presiding official\u2019s award of attorney fees because \u201c[b]ased on the findings ... it is clear that if the agency had properly inquired into the facts presented by appellant\u2019s written reply to the charges, the agency would have \u2014 and certainly should have \u2014 ascertained at the outset that the central charge against appellant was without merit.\u201d That opinion also mentions that the agency piled on \u201cstale and merit-less related charges.\u201d But contrary to petitioner\u2019s argument, the award of attorney fees to O\u2019Donnell firmly rested, not on any \u201cpiling on\u201d, but on the finding that the agency knew or should have known that \u201cthe central charge ... was without merit.\u201d This is in direct contrast to the current case, where petitioner has admitted the serious charge against him. There is no evidence that the agency bore petitioner ill will, that it brought its action in bad faith to harass him or that it intentionally prolonged the proceedings. And as we have said, <em>supra, </em>there was no reasonable- way in which the Navy could have foreseen the MSPB\u2019s <em>Douglas </em>standards and decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b1667-8\">We do not at all say that Sims\u2019 attorney performed less than creditably or that he is not entitled to receive adequate compensation from petitioner. Counsel succeeded in reducing the sanction from total removal to a 10-day suspension; through his efforts Sims was entitled to reinstatement and presumably received about two years in back pay (or its equivalent). But the question here is, not whether the attorney should be paid for his success, but only whether the government is the one to bear that burden under the criterion Congress has established. All we hold is that the MSPB properly ruled that the government should not bear that burden here. <em>See also Sterner v. Department of the Army, supra, </em>711 F.2d 1563 (Fed.Cir.1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b1667-9\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1662-14\">. Petitioner\u2019s removal was for (1) fraudulently using a government purchase document to obtain an electrical switch box for his private use, and (2) misuse of government time by absenting himself from his work area during attempts to return the box. Sims apparently intended to take the switch box off the base but ultimately returned it before doing so.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1665-8\">. The Savings Clause provides in part that \u201c[n]o provision of this Act shall affect any administrative proceedings pending at the time such provision takes effect. Orders shall be issued in such proceedings and appeals shall be taken therefrom as if. this Act had not been enacted.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1665-19\">. Sims\u2019 reliance on the reasoning of the district court in <em>Crowley </em>is thus unavailing, the district court having been reversed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1665-20\">. There is no contention in this case that petitioner failed to \u201cprevail\u201d before the MSPB for the purpose of the attorney fees provision. <em>See Sterner v. Department of the Army, </em>711 F.2d 1563 (Fed.Cir.1983).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1666-5\">. According to the presiding official:</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b1666-7\">. Petitioner has asserted that the Naval Weapons Support Center\u2019s disciplinary guidelines, dated September 1, 1976, specifically require \u201clike penalties for like offenses.\u201d Thus, he says, the agency knew from its own guidelines that it would not prevail in the removal proceedings, and it is therefore immaterial that <em>Douglas </em>was issued after the presiding official\u2019s determination. This argument misconstrues the import of <em>Douglas. </em>The notion of \u201clike penalties for like offenses\u201d is general and ambiguous, and it was not until <em>Douglas </em>that detailed standards for fairness in determining penalties were established by the MSPB. Moreover, the mitigation in petitioner\u2019s punishment occurred not simply because <em>Douglas </em>required consistency in penalties for those similarly charged. <em>Douglas </em>also placed the burden on the agency of proving that the \u201cselection of a penalty was based on consideration of the relevant factors.\u201d <em>Douglas, </em>5 MSPB at 329. In Sims\u2019 case, the board, in mitigating the penalty, explained that there was no evidence of record that the agency had met its burden. For these reasons, we cannot say that the agency knew or should have known the substance of the <em>Douglas </em>decision, either with regard to its burden of proof or the specific factors to be considered.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
