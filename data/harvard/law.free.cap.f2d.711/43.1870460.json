INS, </em>705 F.2d 1150, 1150 (9th Cir.1983); <em>Diaz-Salazar v. INS, </em>700 F.2d 1156, 1159 (7th Cir.1983). We agree. Another path for review of a denial of a stay already exists: \u201cIn situations to which the provisions of \u00a7 106(a) [8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1105a(a) ] are inapplicable, the alien\u2019s remedies would, of course, ordinarily lie first in an action brought in an appropriate district court.\u201d <em>Cheng Fan Kwok v. INS, </em>392 U.S. 206, 210, 88 S.Ct. 1970, 1973, 20 L.Ed.2d 1037 (1968). Petitioners seek the \u00a7 1105a(a) path because it automatically stays the deportation proceedings regardless of whether the motion to reopen has any basis in law or fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-5\">The potential for abusive delay is obvious. An alien files a motion to reopen his order of deportation and at the same time requests a stay. When the stay is denied he petitions for review of the denial of stay in the court of appeals, thereby obtaining an automatic stay. As soon as the motion to reopen is denied, the alien files another motion to reopen and another request for a stay, and then petitions for review of the denial of this second request for a stay, thereby obtaining an automatic stay once again. As long as a petition for review is pending in this court, a series of automatic stays will bar deportation of the alien, regardless of the merits of his case. We do not here, and caution that we will not in the future, tolerate this sort of sharp dealing.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b128-6\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DISMISSED, MANDATE TO ISSUE IMMEDIATELY.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"ArB\">. The record reflects that petitioners conceded their deportability at a hearing <em>over four years ago, </em>on May 26, 1979. Since then they have filed three petitions for review with this court (as well as a request for reinstatement of one of these petitions) and repeatedly failed to report for deportation as directed. Their latest self-styled \u201cskeleton motion\u201d to reopen contributes nothing new other than an additional chapter to this history of immigration law abuse.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
