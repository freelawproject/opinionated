The Department denied the request, stating that the report is not an \u201cagency record\u201d within the meaning of the Act. The requestors then filed an action in federal district court to compel disclosure.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The district court granted summary judgment in favor of the Department, having concluded that the report of the President-elect\u2019s transition team is not an \u201cagency record\u201d within the meaning of the FOIA. <em>Wolfe v. Department of Health and Human Services, </em>539 F.Supp. 276 (D.D.C.1982). We agree with the district court and, therefore, affirm the grant of summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1162-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1162-6\">By letter in July 1981, plaintiffs requested the Department of Health and Human Services to provide access \u201cto all reports compiled by the Department of Health and Human Services\u2019 transition team.\u201d The Department responded that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AzZ\">[materials developed to aid in the transition were compiled for the Office of the President-Elect prior to the Inauguration and did not become a part of Departmental files. Thus, there are no records in our possession which would respond to your request.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1162-7\">Record (R.) 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b1162-8\">This decision was appealed to the Assistant Secretary of Management and Budget for the Department, who denied the appeal and reiterated that the documents requested were not \u201cagency records\u201d because they were \u201cneither made, received, nor preserved by the Department\u201d and were not in \u201cthe possession or control of the Department.\u201d R. 13. The plaintiffs then filed this action in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia.</p>\n<p id=\"b1162-12\">The facts regarding the documents are uncontroverted.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The documents were compiled by President-elect Reagan\u2019s transition team and consist of a one-volume final report, two volumes of appendices, and eight volumes of correspondence. The transition team completed its work on December 20, 1980, and distributed copies of the report to the President-elect\u2019s advisor, Edwin Meese, the central transition team, members of the Department transition team, and Secretary-designate (then Senator) Richard Schweiker. Secretary-designate Schweiker gave his copy to an aide, David Newhall, who made a copy for himself and retained both his and the Secretary-designate\u2019s copy. Following Secretary Schweiker\u2019s confirmation, Newhall was appointed as the Secretary\u2019s Chief-of-Staff. When he moved into the Department\u2019s offices, Newhall brought both copies of the report with him and placed them in a locked, glass bookcase in his office marked \u201cpersonal.\u201d Neither Newhall, Schweiker, nor any other Department employee ever used or consulted these documents, except in preparation for this litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1162-13\">Applying <em>Kissinger v. Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press, </em>445 U.S. 136, 100 S.Ct. 960, 63 L.Ed.2d 267 (1980), to these facts, the district court concluded that the Department of Health and Human Services never possessed or exercised control over the transition team reports. The court stated that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1162-14\">in this case although copies of the report are physically located at HHS the report <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1079\">*1079</page-number>was not generated by HHS, is not within the control of HHS, and indeed never entered the Department\u2019s files or was ever used by the Department for any purpose.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1163-4\"><em>Wolfe, supra, </em>539 F.Supp. at 277.</p>\n<p id=\"ars-dedup-0\">Therefore, the court held that the transition team reports were not \u201cagency records\u201d within the meaning of the FOIA.</p>\n<p id=\"b1163-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1163-6\">\u201cUnder 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(B) federal jurisdiction is dependent upon a showing that an agency has (1) \u2018improperly\u2019; (2) \u2018withheld\u2019; (3) \u2018agency records.\u2019 \u201d <em>Kissinger, supra, </em>445 U.S. at 150, 100 S.Ct. at 968. A threshold inquiry in any FOIA case is whether the documents requested are in fact \u201cagency records.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Although the Act does not contain a definition of the term, the Supreme Court has established that a document qualifies as an \u201cagency record\u201d if it was either \u201ccreated\u201d or \u201cobtained\u201d by an agency subject to the FOIA. <em>Forsham v. Harris, </em>445 U.S. 169, 182, 100 S.Ct. 978, 985, 63 L.Ed.2d 293 (1980). The Department of Health and Human Services did not \u201ccreate\u201d these documents.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Therefore, the transition team reports can be \u201cagency records\u201d only if the Department has \u201cobtained\u201d them.</p>\n<p id=\"b1163-16\">While the Supreme Court has expressly declined \u201cto categorize what agency conduct is necessary to support a finding that [the agency] has \u2018obtained\u2019 documents,\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> at the least, the agency cannot have \u201cobtained\u201d documents until it has possession or control over them.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In <em>Forsham, </em>the Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1080\">*1080</page-number>emphasized the \u201cpossessory\u201d concept implicit in the Act, noting that documents which have not passed from \u201cprivate to agency control\u201d are not \u201cagency records\u201d within the meaning of the Act. <em>Id. </em>at 185, 100 S.Ct. at 986. Possession of the documents, sufficient for FOIA purposes, embodies more than the mere physical location of the documents; the <em>agency </em>must actually have custody of the documents. There must be some \u201cnexus\u201d between the agency and the documents other than the mere incidence of location. <em>Id. </em>at 178, 100 S.Ct. at 983.</p>\n<p id=\"b1164-4\">Establishing who \u201cpossesses\u201d documents is a factual determination. To support their assertion that these materials belong to the Department, the requestors rely upon the mere fact that two sets of the transition team documents are within the four walls of the agency. Such a showing is insufficient. As the Supreme Court stated in <em>Kissinger:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1164-5\">We simply decline to hold that the <em>physical location </em>of the notes of telephone conversations renders them \u201cagency records.\u201d The papers were not in control of the State Department at any time. They were not generated in the State Department. They never entered the State Department\u2019s files, and they were not used by the Department for any purpose. If mere physical location of papers and material could confer status as an \u201cagency record\u201d Kissinger\u2019s personal books, speeches, and all other memorabilia stored in his office would have been agency records subject to disclosure under the FOIA.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1164-6\">445 U.S. at 157, 100 S.Ct. at 972 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b1164-7\">Newhall\u2019s possession of the transition team reports is analogous to Kissinger\u2019s possession of his telephone notes. In both instances the documents were generated by an entity outside the reach of the FOIA; the individual\u2019s personal possession of the documents pre-dated his affiliation with the agency; and the individual brought the documents within the four walls of the agency, but did not integrate the documents with agency files or records. In neither case was there any real nexus between the documents and the agency other than their physical location. Neither set of documents lost its private character simply upon arrival within the agency building.</p>\n<p id=\"b1164-10\">The uncontroverted facts reveal that the transition team documents never entered the Department\u2019s files and/or resources. In a sworn affidavit, Mr. Casciotti, the Deputy Executive Secretary for Human Services, Department of Health and Human Services, attests that he conducted a search of the Department\u2019s records systems, including computerized records, and found no indication that the documents had ever been within the files of the Department. Casciotti Affidavit \u00b6 5 (R. 7). The Department of Health and Human Services was never in \u201cpossession\u201d of these transition team documents.</p>\n<p id=\"b1164-11\">Appellants attempt to distinguish <em>Kissinger v. Reporters Committee </em>and urge reliance upon <em>Ryan </em>v. <em>Department of Jus</em>tice, 617 F.2d 781 (D.C.Cir.1980), to establish agency possession. In <em>Ryan, </em>this court found that the Attorney General\u2019s possession of certain documents authored by United States Senators was coextensive with possession by the Justice Department for the purposes of the FOIA. Appellants assert that unlike the telephone notes in <em>Kissinger, </em>the documents in <em>Ryan </em>actually \u201crelated to\u201d the business of the agency in which they were housed. It was because the documents in the Attorney General\u2019s' possession were essential to the business of the Justice Department, appellants assert, that they became \u201cagency records.\u201d Applying their <em>Ryan </em>analysis to the instant situation, appellants argue that because the transition team reports \u201crelate to\u201d the Department of Health and Human Services, possession of these documents by an agency official automatically confers agency pos<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1081\">*1081</page-number>session. We do not read <em>Ryan </em>to stand for the proposition that an agency official\u2019s actual, physical possession of documents automatically renders them \u201cagency\u201d documents for purposes of the FOIA.</p>\n<p id=\"b1165-4\">In <em>Ryan, </em>the documents were requested by and delivered to the Attorney General <em>during </em>his tenure and were intended to be used by the Attorney General to execute Justice Department business. The <em>Ryan </em>court summarily stated that the documents were in the \u201cpossession of the Justice Department\u201d because the <em>agency\u2019s possession </em>and <em>use </em>of the documents was not controverted. 617 F.2d at 786. In fact the issue in <em>Ryan </em>was not \u201cpossession.\u201d Rather, the dispositive issues were first, who had \u201ccontrol\u201d over the documents \u2014 the Senators, the President, or the Attorney General; and second, whether the various functions of the Attorney General and the Justice Department could be isolated for the purpose of determining when the agency was functioning as a FOIA agency and when the Attorney General was functioning as a FOIA-exempt, personal advisor to the President.</p>\n<p id=\"b1165-5\">In this case, Newhall\u2019s possession of the transition team reports is analogous to an individual\u2019s possession of a thesis that analyzes the agency and its policies. The fact that the thesis \u201crelates to\u201d the business of the Department would not render it an \u201cagency record.\u201d As long as it remains in private possession, the thesis is indistinguishable from any other material with which a public employee may come into contact and which \u201crelates to\u201d his job. Accepting appellants\u2019 \u201crelates to\u201d theory would extend the FOIA to an essentially limitless number of materials which could be said to \u201crelate to\u201d agency business. The Act was not intended to be accorded such a reach. The fact that the transition team reports \u201crelate to\u201d the business of the Department does not distinguish them from the telephone notes in <em>Kissinger; </em>neither set of documents ever lost its private character.</p>\n<p id=\"b1165-10\">Agency \u201ccontrol\u201d is a second indication that an agency has \u201cobtained\u201d a document within the meaning of the FOIA.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The transition team reports were never within the Department\u2019s \u201ccontrol.\u201d The fact that the Department never integrated these documents into its records system suggests the absence of Department control. Furthermore, the fact that no one in the agency ever read or relied upon these documents supports the finding that neither Newhall nor the Secretary ever surrendered his exclusive, <em>private </em>control over the reports.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Caseiotti Affidavit \u00b6\u00b6 5, 6 (R. 7); Newhall Affidavit \u00b6 5 (R. 7). Based upon the uncontested facts, we conclude that the Department never obtained control over these documents.</p>\n<p id=\"b1165-11\">Appellants assert that, notwithstanding the fact that the documents have not been used by anyone in the agency, the fact that the documents were within the agency building made it <em>possible </em>for agency personnel to use them. The measure of whether a document, not created by a FOIA agency, is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1082\">*1082</page-number>an \u201cagency record\u201d depends upon whether it has actually been obtained by an agency subject to the Act. \u201c[T]he FOIA applies to records which have been <em>in fact </em>obtained, and not to records which merely <em>could have been </em>obtained.\u201d <em>Forsham, supra, </em>445 U.S. at 186, 100 S.Ct. at 987. An unexercised agency right of access is irrelevant.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1166-4\">Our disposition of this case comports with the result reached in a similar case, <em>Illinois Institute for Continuing Legal Education v. United States Department of Labor, </em>545 F.Supp. 1229 (N.D.Ill.1982). The plaintiffs in <em>Illinois Institute </em>sought disclosure of a \u201cbriefing book\u201d on the Department of Labor prepared by the President-elect\u2019s transition team. In a thorough opinion, Judge Prentiss Marshall held that one volume of the briefing book was not subject to the FOIA because it was not an \u201cagency record.\u201d <footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Judge Marshall\u2019s conclusion was based upon two separate grounds. First, Judge Marshall held that a President-elect\u2019s transition team is not an \u201cagency\u201d within the meaning of the Act. Therefore, the document was not an \u201cagency record\u201d when created. <em>Id. </em>at 1231-33. Second, the document was not a Department of Labor \u201cagency record\u201d because that agency neither \u201ccreated\u201d the document nor ever \u201cobtained\u201d it. <em>Id. </em>at 1233-35. Judge Marshall found the fact that the document was located within the agency to be of \u201cno functional significance\u201d and he concluded that the document had never lost its \u201ccharacter as a private paper\u201d because it had never been used by an agency official. Based upon this analysis, Judge Marshall held that the document was not an \u201cagency record\u201d within the meaning of the Act and granted summary judgment for the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b1166-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b1166-6\">To be subject to the disclosure requirements of the FOIA, the transition team reports must be \u201cagency records.\u201d To be \u201cagency records,\u201d the documents must have been \u201ccreated\u201d or \u201cobtained\u201d by a FOIA agency. These documents were not \u201ccreated\u201d by an agency within the reach of the FOIA and were never \u201cobtained\u201d by the Department of Health and Human Services. Therefore, these documents are <em>not </em>\u201cagency records\u201d of the Department.</p>\n<p id=\"b1166-9\">The plaintiffs have failed to establish a threshold requirement in any FOIA action, <em>i.e., </em>that the documents requested are \u201cagency records.\u201d For this reason, the district court properly granted summary judgment for the defendants. The order of the district court is <em>affirmed.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1166-10\">\n<em>Judgment accordingly.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1162-9\">. The statute provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1162-10\">On complaint, the district court of the United States ... has jurisdiction to enjoin the agency from withholding agency records and to order the production of any agency records improperly withheld from the complainant.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AzWj\">5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(B).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1162-15\">. The trial judge found there to be no genuine issue of material fact regarding the origin of the documents, their use, or their present location. These facts were established by uncon-troverted affidavits. 539 F.Supp. at 277. Consequently, appellants\u2019 challenge to the propriety of the grant of summary judgment is unfounded.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1163-7\">. Restating the jurisdictional test of the <em>Kissinger </em>majority, Justice Stevens recommends that the \u201ccorrect analysis\u201d in FOIA cases requires the court to</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1163-8\">confront three separate questions in the following order:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1163-9\">(1) are any of the requested documents \u201cagency records\u201d?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1163-10\">(2) if so, have any of them been withheld because they are in the <em>legal </em>custody of the agency? and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1163-11\">(3) if so, was the withholding improper?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ajo-dedup-0\"><em>Kissinger, supra, </em>445 U.S. at 162, 100 S.Ct. at 974. (Stevens, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part).</p>\n<p id=\"b1163-12\"><em>See McGehee v. CIA, </em>697 F.2d 1095, 1105 (D.C. Cir.1983), <em>modified in other respects on reh\u2019g, </em>711 F.2d 1076(1983).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1163-13\">. Appellants do not contend that the documents were \u201cagency records\u201d when they were created. Brief for Appellants at 12 n. 2 and Reply Brief at 4. <em>See also Wolfe, supra, </em>539 F.Supp. at 288 n. 1. Such a contention would be premised upon a finding that the President-elect\u2019s transition team was a FOIA agency and would require this court to employ a different analysis. <em>Cf. McGehee, supra, </em>697 F.2d at 1108-09 (distinguishing between documents in an agency\u2019s <em>possession </em>that were created by entities not subject to the FOIA and documents originally compiled by organs of government that fall within the Act\u2019s ambit). Because appellants do not contend that these documents <em>originated </em>with a FOIA agency, our analysis proceeds from the premise that these documents were created by a non-FOIA agency and jurisdiction under the Act is proper only if the Department has \u201cobtained\u201d them.</p>\n<p id=\"b1163-14\">Recognizing that the issue is not presented in this case, we note that one court has ruled that the President-elect\u2019s transition team is not an \u201cagency\u201d within the meaning of the FOIA. <em>Illinois Institute for Continuing Legal Education v. United States Dep\u2019t of Labor, </em>545 F.Supp. 1229, 1231-33 (N.D.Ill.1982).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1163-18\">. <em>Forsham, supra, </em>445 U.S. at 186 n. 17, 100 S.Ct. at 987 n. 17.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b1163-19\">. In <em>Kissinger, </em>the Court reasoned that for an agency to \u201cwithhold\u201d a document within the meaning of the Act \u201cpresupposes the [agency\u2019s] possession <em>or </em>control of the item withheld.\u201d 445 U.S. at 151, 100 S.Ct. at 968 (emphasis added). The <em>Kissinger </em>Court did not directly address the significance of its use of the disjunctive \u201cor\u201d as opposed to the conjunctive \u201cand.\u201d The caselaw in this Circuit suggests that \u201cpossession\u201d is a necessary, but not sufficient element to establish that an agency has \u201cobtained\u201d a document. <em>Goland v. CIA, </em>607 F.2d 339, 345-46 (D.C.Cir.1978), <em>cert, denied, </em>445 U.S. 927, 100 S.Ct. 1312, 63 L.Ed.2d 759 (1980); <em>Iglesias v. CIA, </em>525 F.Supp. 547, 565 (D.D.C.1981). <em>Cf.

Language in the Supreme Court\u2019s <em>Forsham </em>opinion suggests, however, that agency possession alone might be sufficient to render the document an \u201cagency record\u201d subject to the Act. <em>Forsham, supra, </em>445 U.S. at 185, 100 S.Ct. at 986.</p>\n<p id=\"b1163-20\">If \u201cpossession\u201d is a necessary predicate to the finding that an agency has \u201cobtained\u201d a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1080\">*1080</page-number>document, then our analysis would end with the finding that the Department never possessed these documents. However, because the possession-control test is unclear, we examine both elements and conclude that the Department never exercised either possession or control over the transition team reports.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b1165-6\">. <em>See </em>text at 1079 and note 6 <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1165-7\">The \u201ccontrol\u201d issue has been analyzed from two different perspectives. Some courts look to the document creator\u2019s intent to retain control, <em>Goland, supra; Carson v. United States Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>631 F.2d 1008, 1010-15 (D.C. Cir.1980), while others examine the control exercised by the agency to which the FOIA request is directed, <em>Kissinger, supra, </em>445 U.S. at 157, 100 S.Ct. at 972. <em>See generally, McGehee v.
