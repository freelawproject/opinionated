The Board ordered full reinstatement with backpay. Because AMP refused to comply with the decision, the Board seeks enforcement of its order pursuant to \u00a7 10(e) of the Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 160(e). We conclude that the Board\u2019s findings are supported by substantial evidence on the record considered as a whole, and enforce its order in full.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b712-8\">Brower was employed as an over-the-road truck driver at the Crowley, Texas facility of Associated Milk Producers. Like all over-the-road drivers at AMP, Brower\u2019s pay was based on the number of miles he drove during the pay period. Route drivers, on the other hand, were paid an hourly wage.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-9\">When Brower was hired, the teamsters local affiliated with the International Brotherhood of Teamsters was conducting an organizing campaign at the Crowley terminal. Brower was openly and vociferously opposed to the union. Brower\u2019s supervisor and the terminal manager of the Crowley facility, J.D. Foster, was aware of Brower\u2019s anti-union sentiments. At one point, the two men were discussing the activities of two union supporters. Foster told Brower that \u201che could get rid of anyone at anytime he wanted to, union or not,\u201d and that \u201che would get rid of agitators when the time came.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b712-10\">In September, 1979, Brower was sent on a run to the Oaks Farm Dairy Company in Dallas. When he attempted to back his truck toward an unloading bay door, he hit a column post and a steel cabinet. The accident resulted in $1500 damage to the truck. Brower reported the incident to Foster. Foster responded, \u201cWell, it\u2019s no big deal. It happens. Make an accident report and we\u2019ll take care of it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b712-12\">An election was eventually held, and the union lost. It filed objections with the National Labor Relations Board. The Board set aside the election and ordered that a new one be held.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-13\">In the spring of 1980, AMP announced that, from that time forward, over-the-road drivers would be paid by the hour rather than by the mile. This resulted in a 60% reduction in Brower\u2019s pay. Brower was furious. He immediately became a staunch supporter of the union, and communicated his change of heart to Foster in no uncertain terms. The congenial relationship that had developed between Foster and Brower disintegrated.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-14\">Brower was sent to the company\u2019s El Paso terminal for a load of milk. While he was there, Brower accused the company of being unfair and urged his fellow drivers to support the union. He also vilified AMP in a meeting with Bob Smith, the El Paso terminal supervisor.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-15\">Smith called Foster and told him not to send Brower to the El Paso terminal again. When Brower returned to Crowley, Foster placed him on \u201csick leave.\u201d Apparently, Foster was referring to Brower\u2019s remark that AMP\u2019s conduct made him sick. Foster said, \u201cThe management doesn\u2019t want you to come back to El Paso because you talk too much. You agitate.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b712-16\">After several days of \u201csick leave,\u201d Brow-er filed an unfair labor practice charge with the Board. After a copy of this charge was sent to AMP, Brower was put back to work, this time as a route driver.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-17\">On his first day back on the job, Brower was sent to Vandervoot\u2019s Dairy in Fort Worth. In the process of backing his rig down the ramp of a loading bay, Brower scraped the left rear fender skirt of the trailer against the wall of the bay. The scratch was ten to twelve inches long. It was hardly noticeable among the many scratches and marks already present on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"629\">*629</page-number>fender skirt. The mishap was observed by two witnesses. Neither witness said anything to Brower, but one reported the event to Poster two days later.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-4\">Poster called Brower to his office and charged Brower with failure to report an accident. Despite Brower\u2019s claim of ignorance, Poster discharged him. Foster cited the company rule, found in the drivers\u2019 manual, that provided: \u201cEvery accident is to be reported to AMPI, giving all the possible information before leaving the scene of the accident. Failure to report an accident is cause for immediate dismissal.\u201d Brower asked how many other employees had been fired because they failed to report an accident. Foster answered, \u201cNone. But I\u2019m firing you.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b713-5\">The Board\u2019s General Counsel filed a complaint on Brower\u2019s behalf. An administrative law judge dismissed the complaint. The ALJ concluded that the General Counsel established a prima facie case that the company had violated section 8(a)(3), but that the company had successfully rebutted that case by proving that it would have discharged Brower notwithstanding his protected activities.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-6\">The General Counsel filed exceptions to the ALJ\u2019s decision. The Board reversed. The Board agreed that the General Counsel proved a prima facie case of unlawful discharge. It disagreed, however, with the ALJ\u2019s conclusion that AMP had successfully rebutted the prima facie case, and concluded that Brower had been illegally discharged. AMP\u2019s refusal to comply with the order has resulted in this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b713-8\">AMP argues that the Board improperly allocated the burden of proof. In <em>Wright Line, </em>251 N.L.R.B. 1083 (1980), <em>enforced, </em>662 F.2d 899 (1st Cir.1981), <em>cert, denied, </em>455 U.S. 989, 102 S.Ct. 1612, 71 L.Ed.2d 848 (1982), the Board formulated the correct allocation of the burden of proof in dual motive discharge cases such as this one. The <em>Wright Line </em>formula was recently approved by the Supreme Court in <em>National Labor Relations Board v. Transportation Management Corp., </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 103 S.Ct. 2469, 76 L.Ed.2d 667 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b713-13\">Under <em>Wright Line, </em>the General Counsel has the initial burden of persuading the Board that an anti-union animus contributed to the employer\u2019s decision to discharge an employee. This burden never shifts. The General Counsel <em>always </em>retains the responsibility to show that the employee\u2019s protected conduct was a substantial and motivating factor in the adverse action. <em>See </em>\u00a7 10(c) of the NLRA, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 160(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b713-14\">An employer may prove that the employee\u2019s protected activity was not a substantial and motivating factor in its decision to discharge the employee. But even if the General Counsel is able to establish his prima facie case, the employer may still avoid a finding that it violated the Act if it can prove by a preponderance of the evidence that it would have discharged the employee even if the employee had not been involved with the union. Proof that the discharge would have occurred irrespective of the employee\u2019s protected activity and for valid reasons amounts to an affirmative defense on which the employer carries the burden of proof by a preponderance of the evidence. <em>Transportation Management Corp., </em>\u2014 U.S. at \u2014, 103 S.Ct. at 2472.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-17\">In the case at bar, the Board correctly placed the burden of proof on AMP to demonstrate that Brower would have been terminated even absent his union activities. By requiring the company to establish its affirmative defense, the Board did not change or add to the elements of the unfair labor practice that the General Counsel had the burden of proving under \u00a7 10(c). In short, the company\u2019s contention that the Board\u2019s order cannot stand because of its reliance on <em>Wright Line </em>has been foreclosed in <em>Transportation Management Corp.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b713-18\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b713-19\">AMP argues that the General Counsel failed to prove a violation of sections 8(a)(3). First, it contends that there was no evidence that Brower engaged in protected <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"630\">*630</page-number>activity. This contention is without merit. Brower vigorously advocated support for the union to several employees at the company\u2019s El Paso facility. Such solicitation is unquestionably an activity inducing group action that is protected under section 7 of the Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 157. <em>See NLRB v. McCauley, </em>657 F.2d 685, 687-88 (5th Cir. 1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b714-4\">AMP also argues that it had a legitimate business reason for discharging Brow-er. It points to the company rule requiring drivers to report their accidents, and Brow-er\u2019s failure to comply with that rule. The Board concluded that AMP failed to prove that it would have discharged Brower even if Brower were not a union supporter. Substantial evidence supports this determination. The company\u2019s rule is discretionary on its face. It provides: \u201cFailure to report an accident is cause for immediate dismissal.\u201d Thus, the company was not compelled in any way to discharge Brower. Foster admitted that no other employee had ever been fired for failure to report an accident. When Brower was anti-union and did $1500 damage to his truck, he did not even receive a reprimand. The accident that resulted in his discharge was trivial, yet the penalty was severe, and inflicted without warning. The evidence strongly indicated that Brow-er was not even aware of the accident. Foster had previously threatened to \u201cget rid of agitators when the time came.\u201d In a prior case, AMP was found to have illegally seized upon a minor infraction of the rules in order to discharge a union sympathizer. Given all this evidence, the Board was certainly entitled to conclude that AMP failed to prove the elements of its <em>Wright Line </em>affirmative defense by a preponderance of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-5\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b714-6\">Our review of the record convinces us that the Board\u2019s findings and conclusions are supported by substantial evidence. The General Counsel successfully proved by a preponderance of the evidence that AMP\u2019s anti-union animus was a substantial and motivating factor in the decision to discharge Brower. AMP failed to prove that Brower would have been discharged even if his sentiments had remained anti-union. For these reasons, the Board\u2019s petition for enforcement of its order is</p>\n<p id=\"b714-8\">GRANTED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
