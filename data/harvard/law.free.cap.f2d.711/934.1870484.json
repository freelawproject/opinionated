(Beer Nuts) sued Clover Club Foods (Clover Club) alleging trademark infringement under 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1114 (1976), unfair competition under 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1125 (1976),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and a pendent claim of state law trademark infringement. These claims arose from Clover Club\u2019s use of the words \u201cBrew Nuts\u201d with a picture of an overflowing stein on packages containing a sweetened, salted peanut product virtually identical to. a product sold by Beer Nuts. Clover Club counterclaimed, seeking a declaration that Beer Nuts\u2019 registered trademark is void. After a bench trial, the district court denied relief to both parties and both parties have appealed. We reverse and remand for further proceedings. 520 F.Supp. 395.</p>\n<p id=\"b1021-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"937\">*937</page-number>I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1021-5\">TRADEMARK USE</p>\n<p id=\"b1021-6\">The term \u201cBeer Nuts\u201d was registered as a trademark in 1955 and has become incontestable under section 1065.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Beer Nuts claims that its right to the exclusive use of its trademark has been infringed because Clover Club\u2019s use of the term \u201cBrew Nuts\u201d together with an overflowing stein constitutes a trademark likely to cause confusion. The district court stated in its memorandum opinion, however, that \u201cClover Club\u2019s use of the words \u2018Brew Nuts\u2019 is a description of its product rather than a trademark.\u201d Rec., vol. I, at 51.</p>\n<p id=\"b1021-7\">The defenses to the claimed infringement of an incontestable trademark are codified in section 1115<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The \u201cfair use\u201d defense permits the use of a name or term, <em>other than as a trademark, </em>that is descriptive and is used fairly and in good faith only to describe the goods. \u00a7 1115(b)(4). This defense is not available if the alleged descriptive use is in fact a trademark use. <em>Soweco, Inc. v. Shell Oil Co., </em>617 F.2d 1178, 1187 (5th Cir.1980), <em>cert. denied, </em>450 U.S. 981, 101 S.Ct. 1516, 67 L.Ed.2d 816 (1981); <em>Abercrombie &amp; Fitch Co. v. Hunting World, Inc., </em>537 F.2d 4, 12-13 (2d Cir.1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b1021-17\">We do not believe the district court\u2019s statement that \u201cBrew Nuts\u201d is used as a description rather than as a trademark was intended as a holding that Clover Club established a \u201cfair use\u201d defense under section 1115(b)(4). In the first place, Clover Club did not plead the \u201cfair use\u201d defense in its answer to the complaint, nor did it assert the defense as an issue in the pretrial order. Moreover, the district court made no findings that the descriptive use was accomplished \u201cfairly and in good faith.\u201d <em>See </em>\u00a7 1115(b)(4); <em>cf. M.B.H. Enterprises v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"938\">*938</page-number><em>WOKY, Inc., </em>633 F.2d 50, 53-54 (7th Cir. 1980) (findings adequate).</p>\n<p id=\"b1022-4\">In any event, the record clearly establishes that Clover Club used the words \u201cBrew Nuts\u201d in conjunction with an overflowing stein as a trademark. A term or symbol is used as a trademark when the producer uses it to identify the source of his goods to the public and to distinguish those goods from others. <em>See M.B.H. Enterprises, </em>633 F.2d at 53-54. A trademark is a symbol that attracts public attention, is the most prominent element on the package, and dominates the package as a whole. <em>See Venetianaire Corp. v. A. &amp; P. Import Co., </em>302 F.Supp. 156, 158-59 (S.D.N.Y.1969), <em>aff\u2019d, </em>429 F.2d 1079 (2d Cir.1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b1022-5\">In this case, the words \u201cBrew Nuts\u201d are much larger than the other lettering on the package and in a different type style. The words are set off in a distinctive red-brown oval, outlined in dark brown and topped by a conspicuous white circle containing a picture of an overflowing beer stein. Below or above the oval, depending on the particular package, is the phrase actually used to describe the product: \u201csweetened salted peanuts.\u201d Furthermore, the president of Clover Club, Robert Sanders, testified repeatedly that Clover Club uses secondary trademarks on some of its products in addition to the company name, and that \u201cBrew Nuts\u201d is such a trademark.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1022-18\">Based on our examination of the Clover Club package, the testimony of Mr. Sanders as to the trademark nature of the \u201cBrew Nuts\u201d logo, and the fact that Clover Club did not contend below that the \u201cBrew Nuts\u201d logo is not a trademark, we conclude as a matter of law that Clover Club has deliberately used \u201cBrew Nuts\u201d as a trademark.</p>\n<p id=\"b1022-19\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1022-20\">INFRINGEMENT</p>\n<p id=\"b1022-21\">The district court held that the \u201cBeer Nuts\u201d trademark was not infringed. Based solely on a side-by-side comparison of the Beer Nuts and Brew Nuts packages, the court determined that \u201cthe product packaging and wording are sufficiently unique so as to preclude any likelihood of confusion as to the <em>origin of </em>the competing products.\u201d Rec., vol. I, at 47 (emphasis in original). Beer Nuts argues that the trial court applied incorrect and incomplete legal standards in making this determination. A survey of the law applicable to the issue of infringement is necessary to provide a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"939\">*939</page-number>framework for our disposition of this contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b1023-5\">\u201cA trademark is a distinctive mark, symbol, or emblem used by a producer or manufacturer to identify and distinguish his goods from those of others.\u201d <em>Educational Development Corp. v. Economy Co., </em>562 F.2d 26, 28 (10th Cir.1977). \u201cThe strength or distinctiveness of a mark determines both the ease with which it may be established as a valid trademark and the degree of protection it will be accorded.\u201d <em>McGregor-Doniger Inc. v. Drizzle, Inc., </em>599 F.2d 1126, 1131 (2d Cir.1979). Trademark strength is measured by \u201cits tendency to identify the goods sold under the mark as emanating from a particular, although possibly anonymous, source.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The use of terms or marks falls into four broad categories for purposes of legal recognition: (1) generic, (2) descriptive, (3) suggestive, and (4) arbitrary or fanciful. <em>Soweco, </em>617 F.2d at 1183. Only the first two categories are relevant to the issues on appeal.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1023-6\">A generic mark has been described as referring to \u201c \u2018a particular genus or class of which an individual article or service is but a member.\u2019 \u201d <em>Soweco, </em>617 F.2d at 1183 (quoting <em>Vision Center v. Opticks Inc., </em>596 F.2d 111, 115 (5th Cir.1979), <em>cert. denied, </em>444 U.S. 1016, 100 S.Ct. 668, 62 L.Ed.2d 646 (1980)). Because a generic mark refers to a general class of goods, it does not indicate the particular source of an item. Consequently, such a1 mark receives no legal protection and may not be registered alone as a trademark. A term that was once a valid trademark may become generic through usage and popular acceptance, and thus no longer be eligible for registration, e.g., escalator, thermos. <em>See McGregor-Doniger, </em>599 F.2d at 1131. A generic word, such as \u201ccola\u201d may be part of a valid trademark, e.g., Coca-Cola. Although the holder of such a valid trademark may not prevent another from incorporating the <em>generic </em>term into a trademark, e.g., Pepsi-Cola, he can prevent its use in a trademark which is so similar to his own that the whole name is likely to be confused with his trademark, e.g., Koka-Cola. See <em>Dixi-Cola Laboratories v. Coca-Cola Co., </em>117 F.2d 352, 355-60 (4th Cir. 1941); <em>see also American Aloe Corp. v. Aloe Creme Laboratories, Inc., </em>420 F.2d 1248, 1251-53 (7th Cir.), <em>cert, denied, </em>400 U.S. 820, 91 S.Ct. 37, 27 L.Ed.2d 47 (1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b1023-10\">\u201cA \u2018descriptive\u2019 term \u2018identifies a characteristic or quality of an article or service,\u2019 ... as, for example, its color, odor, function, dimensions, or ingredients.\u201d <em>Soweco, </em>617 F.2d at 1183 (quoting <em>Vision Center v. Opticks Inc., </em>596 F.2d at 115). Because a descriptive term is one which a competitor would likely need to use in describing his product,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> the term does not indicate that a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"940\">*940</page-number>product comes from a single source. <em>Educational Development Corp., </em>562 F.2d at 28-29. Therefore, a trademark that is descriptive may be registered only if it has acquired a secondary meaning by becoming \u201cdistinctive of the applicant\u2019s goods in commerce.\u201d \u00a7 1052(f); <em>Soweco, </em>617 F.2d at 1183. To establish a secondary meaning, it is not necessary to show that the public is aware of the name of the manufacturer of a product; it is sufficient if the public is aware that the product comes from a single, though anonymous, source.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>Union Carbide Corp. v. Ever-Ready Inc., </em>531 F.2d 366, 380 (7th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>429 U.S. 830, 97 S.Ct. 91, 50 L.Ed.2d 94 (1976); <em>National Nu Grape Co. v. Guest, </em>164 F.2d 874, 877 (10th Cir.1947), <em>cert. denied, </em>333 U.S. 874, 68 S.Ct. 903, 92 L.Ed. 1150 (1948).</p>\n<p id=\"b1024-4\">Infringement of a trademark occurs when the use of a similar mark is likely to cause confusion in the marketplace concerning the source of the different products. <em>Vitek Systems, Inc. v. Abbott Laboratories, </em>675 F.2d 190, 192 (8th Cir.1982). \u201cThe resolution of this issue requires the court to consider numerous factors to determine whether, under all the circumstances, there is a likelihood of confusion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In making this determination, this court has used the criteria set out in <em>Restatement of Torts </em>\u00a7 729 (1938):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1024-5\">\u201c(a) the degree of similarity between the designation and the trade-mark or trade name in</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1024-6\">(i) appearance;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1024-7\">(ii) pronunciation of the words used;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1024-8\">(iii) verbal translation of the pictures or designs involved;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1024-9\">(iv) suggestion;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1024-10\">(b) the intent of the actor in adopting the designation;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1024-12\">(c) the relation in use and manner of marketing between the goods or services marketed by the actor and those marketed by the other;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1024-13\">(d) the degree of care likely to be exercised by purchasers.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1024-14\"><em>See Drexel Enterprises v. Richardson, </em>312 F.2d 525, 528 (10th Cir.1962). Other courts have used some formulation of this same test. <em>See, e.g., Soweco, </em>617 F.2d at 1185; <em>McGregor-Doniger, </em>599 F.2d at 1130; <em>AMF Inc. v. Sleekcraft Boats, </em>599 F.2d 341, 348-49 (9th Cir.1979); <em>Union Carbide Corp., </em>531 F.2d at 381-82; <em>Fotomat Corp. v. Cochran, </em>437 F.Supp. 1231, 1242 (D.Kan.1977). The above list is not exhaustive and no one factor is determinative. The facts of a particular case may require consideration of other variables as well. <em>McGregor-Doniger, </em>599 F.2d at 1130; <em>Polaroid Corp. v. Polar ad Electronics Corp., </em>287 F.2d 492, 495 (2d Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>368 U.S. 820, 82 S.Ct. 36, 7 L.Ed.2d 25 (1961).</p>\n<p id=\"b1024-15\">As set forth above, \u201c[s]imilarity of the marks is tested on three levels: sight, sound, and meaning .... Each must be considered as [it] is encountered in the marketplace. Although similarity is measured by the marks as entities, similarities weigh more heavily than differences.\u201d <em>AMF Inc., </em>599 F.2d at 351; <em>Vitek Systems, Inc., </em>675 F.2d at 192.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1024-16\">\u201cIt is not necessary for similarity to go only to the eye or the ear for there to be infringement. The use of a designation which causes confusion because it conveys the same idea, or stimulates the same mental reaction, or has the same meaning is enjoined on the same basis as where the similarity goes to the eye or the ear. Confusion of origin of goods may be caused alone by confusing similarity in the meaning of the designations em<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"941\">*941</page-number>ployed. The whole background of the case must be considered.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1025-5\"><em>Standard Oil Co. </em>v. <em>Standard Oil Co., </em>252 F.2d 65, 74 (10th Cir.1958) (footnotes omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1025-6\">In evaluating similarity, \u201c[i]t is axiomatic in trademark law that \u2018side-by-side\u2019 comparison is not the test.\u201d <em>Levi Strauss &amp; Co. v. Blue Bell, Inc., </em>632 F.2d 817, 822 (9th Cir.1980); <em>American Home Products Corp. v. Johnson Chemical Co., </em>589 F.2d 103, 107 (2d Cir.1978); <em>James Burrough Ltd. v. Sign of Beefeater, Inc., </em>540 F.2d 266,275 (7th Cir.1976); <em>Fotomat Corp., </em>437 F.Supp. at 1244. The marks \u201cmust be compared in the light of what occurs in the marketplace, not in the courtroom.\u201d <em>James Burrough Ltd., </em>540 F.2d at 275. \u201cA prospective purchaser does not ordinarily carry a sample or specimen of the article he knows well enough to call by its trade name, he necessarily depends upon the mental picture of that which symbolizes origin and ownership of the thing desired.\u201d <em>Avrick v. Rockmont Envelope Co., </em>155 F.2d 568, 573 (10th Cir.1946). Therefore, the court must determine whether the alleged infringing mark will be confusing to the public when singly presented. <em>Id. </em>at 572-73; <em>American Home Products, </em>589 F.2d at 107; <em>James Burrough Ltd., </em>540 F.2d at 275; <em>Union Carbide, </em>531 F.2d at 382.</p>\n<p id=\"b1025-7\">\u201cIntent on the part of the alleged infringer to pass off its goods as the product of another raises an inference of likelihood of confusion .... \u201d <em>Squirtco v. Seven-Up Co., </em>628 F.2d 1086, 1091 (8th Cir. 1980); <em>Alpha Industries v. Alpha Steel Tube &amp; Shapes, Inc., </em>616 F.2d 440, 446 (9th Cir.1980). \u201c[P]roof that a defendant chose a mark with the intent of copying plaintiff\u2019s mark, standing alone, may justify an inference of confusing similarity.\u201d <em>Sun-Fun Products, Inc. v. Suntan Research &amp; Development Inc., </em>656 F.2d 186, 190 (5th Cir.1981). One who adopts a mark similar to another already established in the marketplace does so at his peril, <em>Fotomat Corp., </em>437 F.Supp. at 1243, because the court presumes that he \u201ccan accomplish his purpose: that is, that the public will be deceived.\u201d <em>AMF Inc., </em>599 F.2d at 354; <em>Fotomat Corp., </em>437 F.Supp. at 1243. All doubts must be resolved against him. <em>American Home Products, </em>589 F.2d at 107.</p>\n<p id=\"b1025-9\">Also relevant to likelihood of confusion are the means by which the products are marketed. \u201cConverging marketing channels increase the likelihood of confusion.\u201d <em>AMF Inc., </em>599 F.2d at 353. The possibility of confusion is greatest when products reach the public by the same retail outlets. <em>See generally Exxon Corp. v. Texas Motor Exchange, </em>628 F.2d 500, 505-06 (5th Cir.1980); <em>Scott Paper Co. v. Scott\u2019s Liquid Gold, Inc., </em>589 F.2d 1225, 1229 (3d Cir.1978). Confusing similarity is most likely when the products themselves are very similar. <em>Exxon Corp., </em>628 F.2d at 505; <em>see Fotomat Corp., </em>437 F.Supp. at 1243-44.</p>\n<p id=\"b1025-10\">Finally, the court must examine the degree of care with which the public will choose the products in the marketplace. \u201c \u2018The general impression of the ordinary purchaser, buying under the normally prevalent conditions of the market and giving the attention such purchasers usually give in buying that class of goods, is the touchstone.\u2019 \u201d <em>McGregor-Doniger, </em>599 F.2d at 1137 (quoting 3 R. Callman, <em>The Law of Unfair Competition, Trademarks and Monopolies </em>\u00a7 81.2, at 577 (3d ed. 1969) (footnote omitted)); <em>see Squirtco, </em>628 F.2d at 1091. Buyers typically exercise little care in the selection of inexpensive items that may be purchased on impulse. Despite a lower degree of similarity, these items are more likely to be confused than expensive items which are chosen carefully. <em>Sun-Fun Products, </em>656 F.2d at 191; <em>Fotomat Corp., </em>437 F.Supp. at 1244.</p>\n<p id=\"b1025-11\">In this case, the district court\u2019s resolution of the infringement claim was improperly based solely on a side-by-side package comparison, although the parties presented evidence on other relevant factors, including Clover Club\u2019s intent in adopting the trademark \u201cBrew Nuts,\u201d the manner in which Beer Nuts and Brew Nuts are marketed, and the degree of care purchasers exercise when buying the products.</p>\n<p id=\"b1026-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"942\">*942</page-number><em>See Restatement of Torts, </em>\u00a7 729(b), (c), (d). Moreover, the court erroneously equated likelihood of confusion with similarity. <em>See AMF Inc., </em>599 F.2d at 350. Similarity must be considered along with the other factors set out in the Restatement to determine whether, under all the circumstances of the marketplace, confusion is likely. The court\u2019s failure to weigh all of the relevant factors in determining likelihood of confusion constitutes reversible error. Although we offer no opinion regarding the merits of this case, we remand for a proper evaluation of similarity and a reconsideration of likelihood of confusion under the correct legal standards and the evidence presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b1026-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b1026-5\">THE COUNTERCLAIM</p>\n<p id=\"arm-dedup-1\">In its counterclaim, Clover Club sought cancellation of the \u201cBeer Nuts\u201d trademark on two grounds: that the term \u201cBeer Nuts\u201d was generic and thus was not entitled to registration; and that the \u201cBeer Nuts\u201d registration was fraudulently obtained.</p>\n<p id=\"b1026-6\">A trademark will be refused registration if it is \u201cmerely descriptive\u201d of the goods of the applicant. \u00a7 1052(e). A \u201cmerely descriptive\u201d term is a generic term. The courts have also equated a generic term with a \u201ccommon descriptive name\u201d as used in sections 1064(c) and 1065(4). <em>See Soweco, </em>617 F.2d at 1183 n. 13. Title 15 provides that a trademark registration may be cancelled \u201cat any time if the registered mark becomes the common descriptive name of an article or substance.\u201d \u00a7 1064(c).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Section 1065(4) provides that \u201cno incontestable right [as defined in that section] shall be acquired in a mark which is the common descriptive name of any article or substance, patented or otherwise.\u201d In this case, the district court determined that \u201cBeer Nuts\u201d is a descriptive term with a secondary meaning. The court\u2019s conclusion that the term \u201cBeer Nuts\u201d was not generic at the time of registration is supported by the record, and we uphold it on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1026-10\">Section 1064(c) also provides that an incontestable trademark may be cancelled if its registration was obtained fraudulently. A court should not lightly undertake cancellation on the basis of fraud, <em>Robert V. Vance &amp; Associates, Inc. v. Baronet Corp., </em>487 F.Supp. 790, 800 (N.D.Ga.1979), and the burden of proving fraudulent procurement of a registration is heavy, <em>see W.D. Byron &amp; Sons v. Stein Bros. Manufacturing, </em>377 F.2d 1001, 1003, 54 Oust. &amp; Pat.App. 1442 (Cust. &amp; Pat.App.1967). Any deliberate attempt to mislead the Patent Office must be established by clear and convincing evidence. <em>Money Store v. Harriscorp Finance, Inc., </em>689 F:2d 666, 670 (7th Cir.1982); <em>see also Wrist-Rocket Manufacturing Co. v. Saunders Archery Co., </em>516 F.2d 846, 852 (8th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>423 U.S. 870, 96 S.Ct. 134,46 L.Ed.2d 100 (1975). \u201cStatements of honest, but perhaps incorrect, belief or innocently inaccurate statements of fact are insufficient as are knowing misstatements which would have a <em>de minimus </em>effect on the validity of the service mark.\u201d <em>Five Platters, Inc. </em>v. <em>Purdie, </em>419 F.Supp. 372, 384 (D.Md.1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b1026-11\">The district court denied Clover Club\u2019s claim to strike the \u201cBeer Nuts\u201d registration on the basis of fraud. However, the court made no findings or conclusions on this issue to indicate the factual and legal bases for its decision. Fed.R.Civ.P. 52(a) provides that \u201cthe court shall find the facts specially and state separately its conclusions of law thereon.\u201d In this case the court\u2019s failure to comply with Rule 52(a) on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"943\">*943</page-number>the fraudulent registration issue renders meaningful appellate review impossible. <em>See Squirtco, </em>628 F.2d at 1092.

What names did you suggest for any of the other products?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1022-9\">Answer: The generic terms of the products.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1022-10\">Next question \u2014 ... So the sweetened salted one was the only one for which you felt the need of an additional trademark besides Clover Club?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1022-11\">You answered: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1022-12\">Do you recall being asked that question and giving that answer?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1022-13\">\u201cA.

I was referring to the six or seven nut items that were then being sold under the Clover Club label.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1022-16\">\u201cQ. And why did you say this was the only nut item that you decided to have carry a second trademark?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1022-22\">\u201cA. I considered the other nut items really to be commodities and, therefore, I did not think there would be any value of putting a second mark on them.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1022-23\">\u201cQ.

Although the distinction between descriptive and suggestive marks is uncertain, \u201c[a] term is suggestive if it requires imagination, thought and perception to reach a conclusion as to the nature of goods. A term is descriptive if it forthwith conveys an immediate idea of the ingredients, qualities or characteristics of the goods.\u201d <em>Abercrombie &amp; Fitch Co. </em>v. <em>Hunting World, </em>537 F.2d 4, 11 (2d Cir.1976) (quoting <em>Stix Prods.
