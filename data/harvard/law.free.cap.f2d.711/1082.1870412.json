The relevant background facts were set forth fully in our first opinion and need not be repeated here.</p>\n<p id=\"b1167-19\">That first opinion left to the arbitrator the task of determining whether the procedural error he had previously identified was \u201charmful\u201d within the meaning of 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7701(c)(2)(A) (Supp. V 1981). The INS\u2019s error could be so characterized, we stated, if it either \u201caffected the outcome of the disciplinary proceeding,\u201d or vitiated a substantial right accorded the affected employee by a \u201cclear provision of [the] collective bargaining agreement.\u201d 697 F.2d at 443-44.</p>\n<p id=\"b1167-20\">On remand, the arbitrator reconsidered and reaffirmed his initial decision setting aside the disciplinary sanction imposed by the INS. Although the arbitrator\u2019s judgment appears not inconsistent with our first decision in this case, it is difficult to fathom any coherent line of reasoning in his long and rambling opinion, which consists almost entirely of random quotes from other sources. In reading his opinion, we are hard-pressed to identify either a glimmer of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1084\">*1084</page-number>reasoned consideration, to which we might defer, or a hint that his observations bear any significant relation to the real world.</p>\n<p id=\"b1168-4\">If government agencies and unions in the federal sector are to bind themselves through collective bargaining agreements to arbitrate disciplinary matters, one would hope that the arbitrators selected \u2014 who are given broad authority to construe and enforce labor contracts \u2014 have the time, talent and experience to write intelligible opinions. An opinion such as that submitted here forces the court to choose between placing its stamp of approval on utter gibberish or conducting what would amount to de novo review on a hopelessly inadequate record. Both options, of course, are undesirable.</p>\n<p id=\"b1168-5\">Notwithstanding our dismay over the quality of the arbitral opinion in this case, consistency of the <em>result </em>reached in the arbitrator\u2019s decision with the test established in our original opinion leads us to conclude that approving that result is the lesser of two evils. We therefore affirm the judgment, but not the rationale or opinion, of the arbitrator.</p>\n<p id=\"b1168-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1167-12\">. Pub.L.
