We affirm the Commission\u2019s determination that protective conditions are unnecessary because there exists effective truck competition.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-21\">I. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b416-22\">The companion case to this one, <em>Lamoille Valley Railroad v. ICC, </em>711 F.2d 295, 300-302 (D.C.Cir.1983) describes the statutory scheme governing mergers of two \u201cclass I\u201d railroads and the ICC\u2019s policies on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>such mergers.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We incorporate that discussion by reference and pass on to the facts and issues involved in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-5\">A. <em>The Railroads Involved in this Case</em></p>\n<p id=\"aqy-dedup-0\">Guilford Transportation Industries (Guil-ford) is a holding company that is 100% owned by Timothy Mellon. Guilford already owns the Maine Central Railroad and we approve today, in <em>Lamoille Valley, </em>Guil-ford\u2019s acquisition of the Boston &amp; Maine Railroad.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-6\">Canadian National operates joint north-south service (from Montreal to New York and points south) with the Boston &amp; Maine. Canadian Pacific also operates north-south service jointly with the Boston <em>&amp; </em>Maine. Conrail and the Delaware <em>&amp; </em>Hudson operate competing north-south routes.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-7\">In addition to its north-south service, Canadian National operates east-west service from Maine to the midwest in competition with Canadian Pacific and with a joint Boston &amp; Maine/Delaware &amp; Hudson route. All three lines connect with the Maine Central near Portland, Maine.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-8\">The Maine Central is a profitable railroad with a near-monopoly over rail service to the Maine paper and forest products industries. Prior to its acquisition by Guilford, the Boston &amp; Maine was bankrupt. The Delaware &amp; Hudson is all but bankrupt, kept out of bankruptcy proceedings only by continuing subsidies from the federal government and the state of New York. The Canadian National and the Canadian Pacific are large and profitable transcontinental railroads.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-9\">B. <em>Proceedings Below</em></p>\n<p id=\"b417-10\">On January 29, 1982, Guilford applied to the ICC for permission to acquire the Delaware &amp; Hudson. Its application was contingent on the Commission\u2019s prior approval of Guilford\u2019s proposal to acquire the Boston &amp; Maine. Guilford\u2019s plan to make the Delaware &amp; Hudson profitable depended in part on diverting north-south traffic from the joint Canadian National/Boston &amp; Maine and Canadian Pacific/Boston &amp; Maine lines to the Delaware &amp; Hudson line and diverting east-west traffic from the Canadian lines to the Boston &amp; Maine/Delaware &amp; Hudson east-west line.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-13\">Canadian National did not oppose the overall merger of the Maine Central and the Boston &amp; Maine with the Delaware &amp; Hudson. It was concerned, however, that Guilford might seek to increase traffic diversion from the Boston &amp; Maine/Canadian National north-south route to the competing Delaware &amp; Hudson route by allowing the Boston &amp; Maine\u2019s north-south service to deteriorate. This would reduce the time advantage of the Boston &amp; Maine/Canadian National route over the Delaware &amp; Hudson route. Canadian National therefore requested trackage rights over the Boston &amp; Maine\u2019s portion of the Boston &amp; Maine/Canadian National Line.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-14\">Canadian National also argued to the Commission that, after acquiring the Delaware &amp; Hudson, Guilford will have an incentive to delay the interchange of traffic between the Maine Central and the Canadian National. This would reduce the time advantage of Canadian National\u2019s east-west route and permit Guilford to increase traffic diversion from the Canadian National route to the competing Boston &amp; Maine/Delaware &amp; Hudson route. Canadian National therefore asked the ICC to require Guilford to maintain current interchange service at Danville and Yarmouth Junctions, Maine, where it exchanges traffic with the Maine Central.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b417-15\">The ICC approved the merger and denied Canadian National\u2019s request for protective <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>conditions. It found that the \u201cprimary public benefit\u201d from the merger was \u201cthe lifeline it will provide to the ailing D &amp; H,\u201d without which it was \u201cunlikely that D &amp; H could continue to operate in light of its continuing losses and negative cash flow.\u201d <em>Delaware &amp; Hudson Merger, </em>366 I.C.C. at 400-01.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-4\">The Commission recognized that the merger would reduce north-south rail competition because Guilford would participate in three of the four available routings. It did not view this as a serious problem, however, because of effective truck competition \u2014 \u201call the [north-south] traffic ... is potentially subject to diversion to motor carriage.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 407. Moreover, the Boston &amp; Maine\u2019s north-south line (the Connecticut River line, which runs through Massachusetts and Connecticut) and the Delaware &amp; Hudson\u2019s line (which lies west of the Hudson River in New York) were \u201cnot perfect substitutes for each other.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 408. With regard to possible downgrading of the Boston &amp; Maine\u2019s portion of the joint Boston &amp; Maine/Canadian National north-south line, the Commission found that service over that line \u201ccannot be deemed essential\u201d because truck service was available. <em>Id. </em>at 420.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-5\">As for possible downgrading of interchange service at Danville and Yarmouth Junctions, the Commission had already addressed that issue in its <em>Boston &amp; Maine </em>decision. Its reasons for denying relief in that decision \u2014 principally Guilford\u2019s lack of intent to downgrade and Canadian National\u2019s competitive leverage \u2014 were \u201cequally applicable here.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 419.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-9\">C. <em>Issues Presented</em></p>\n<p id=\"b418-10\">Canadian National argues that the ICC misanalyzed the anticompetitive effects of the merger and Guilford\u2019s incentives to downgrade the Boston &amp; Maine\u2019s north-south service and the Danville and Yar-mouth Junction interchanges.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Intervenors Guilford and Delaware &amp; Hudson support the ICC\u2019s decision. For the reasons given in <em>Lamoille Valley, </em>711 F.2d at 315-323, we conclude that the Commission failed adequately to explain why Guilford would not downgrade service at Danville and Yarmouth Junctions. We therefore remand to the Commission on this issue. With regard to north-south service, we affirm the Commission\u2019s conclusion that the merger will neither substantially reduce competition nor affect essential services.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-11\">II. The Merger\u2019s Effect on North-South Rail Service</p>\n<p id=\"aph-dedup-0\">We incorporate by reference the statement of the standard of review in <em>Lamoille Valley, </em>711 F.2d at 301 n. 3, 307-308, and pass on to analysis of the ICC\u2019s denial of Canadian National\u2019s request for north-south trackage rights.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b418-12\">As discussed in <em>Lamoille Valley, </em>711 F.2d at 302, 310, the Commission will consider imposing conditions on a merger for two reasons \u2014 to prevent significant reduction in competition and to preserve \u201cessential services.\u201d The Commission found that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>neither reason for imposing conditions was present here. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-4\">A. <em>Anticompetitive Effects</em></p>\n<p id=\"AuU\">The Commission found that Guilford\u2019s participation in three of the four north-south routes would not have serious anti-competitive consequences because there was strong truck competition. The presence of truck competition limited the importance of reduction in rail competition. <em>See Delaware &amp; Hudson Merger, </em>366 I.C.C. at 407 (\u201cA change in the number of rail competitors is less significant where there is strong motor carrier competition .... \u201d). Also, truck competition would make it impractical for Guilford to seek to divert traffic to the Delaware &amp; Hudson by downgrading service on Boston &amp; Maine\u2019s north-south line:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b419-5\">The extent to which any rail carrier can exercise control over traffic is greatly diminished in the face of intense motor carrier competition. If rail carriers want to preserve traffic in these circumstances, they cannot afford to favor inefficient routes over efficient ones, even if this means that they will not preserve their longest possible haul.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b419-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 409. Canadian National raises several objections to this analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-7\">1. <em>Including Trucks in the Product Market</em></p>\n<p id=\"b419-8\">First, Canadian National argues that the Commission improperly relied on <em>truck </em>competition to ameliorate the substantial lessening of <em>rail </em>competition caused by the merger. It would have the Commission focus exclusively on rail competition. In antitrust terms, the Commission, in effect, defined the relevant product market as \u201ctransportation of freight,\u201d while Canadian National argues that \u201c[t]he product [market] is the transportation of goods <em>by rail </em>only.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> We believe the Commission properly considered truck competition.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-14\">The Interstate Commerce Act broadly instructs the ICC to determine if a merger is \u201cconsistent with the public interest.\u201d 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 11.344(c). Canadian National relies on Congress\u2019 instruction to the Commission to \u201cconsider,\u201d in making that public interest determination, \u201cwhether the proposed transaction would have an adverse effect among <em>rail carriers </em>in the affected region.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 11,344(b)(1)(E) (emphasis added).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b419-15\">Section 11.344(b)(1) also, however, permits the Commission to consider factors other than those specifically listed; it provides that \u201cthe Commission shall consider <em>at least </em>the following .... \u201d (Emphasis added.) The legislative history of \u00a7 11,-344(b)(1)(E) confirms that the subsection merely codifies prior ICC practice and does not restrict the factors that the ICC may consider. As Congressman Panetta explained in introducing the provision as a floor amendment to the Staggers Rail Act of 1980:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b419-16\">My amendment is not intended to in any way tie the hands of the ICC on the question of mergers.... [Competition plays an important role in the Commission\u2019s decisionmaking on railroad mergers. This is as it should be. My amendment would insure that this remains the case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b419-17\">126 Cong.Rec. H8604 (daily ed. Sept. 9, 1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b419-18\">Thus, the Commission may consider \u201cin-termodal\u201d competition between truck and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>rail, so long as it also considers \u201cintramo-dal\u201d competition among rail carriers. <em>Accord Gilbertville Trucking Co. v. United States, </em>371 U.S. 115,127, 83 S.Ct. 217, 224, 9 L.Ed.2d 177 (1962) (\u201cThe statute entrusts the Commission with the duty to decide what considerations other than those specifically mentioned ... should be given weight.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b420-4\">The only remaining question is whether the Commission has authority to give dominant weight to rail-truck competition, as it did when it concluded that reduction in competition among rail carriers is of little moment in light of vigorous rail-truck competition. We hold that the Commission has this power.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-5\">As a general rule, when a statute requires an agency to \u201cconsider\u201d a factor, the agency must reach \u201can \u2018express and considered conclusion\u2019 about the bearing of [the factor], but need not give \u2018any specific weight\u2019 to th[e] factor.\u201d <em>Small Refiner Lead Phase-Down Task Force v. United States Environmental Protection Agency, </em>705 F.2d 506, 516 (D.C.Cir.1983) (Clean Air Act) (quoting <em>Weyerhaeuser Co. v. Costle, </em>590 F.2d 1011, 1045 (D.C.Cir.1978) (Clean Water Act)). In this case, the ICC properly considered the relevance of competition among rail carriers, explaining that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b420-6\">A change in the number of rail competitors is less significant where there is strong motor carrier competition which prevents carriers from obtaining and exploiting monopoly power.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b420-7\"><em>Delaware &amp; Hudson Merger, </em>366 I.C.C. at 407.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-8\">We think it appropriate to follow that general rule here. A major impetus behind the deregulation of railroads in the Staggers Rail Act of 1980 was- Congress\u2019 recognition that railroads generally had to compete with other modes of transportation. <em>See, e.g., </em>H.R.Rep. No. 1430 (Conf.Rep.), 96th Cong., 2d Sess. 79 (1980), <em>reprinted in </em>1980 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News 4110:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A1q\">[Historically the enactment of the Interstate Commerce Act was essential to prevent an abuse of monopoly power by railroads .... However, today, most transportation is competitive and many of the Government regulations affecting railroads have become unnecessary and inefficient. Nearly two-thirds of intercity freight is transported by modes of transportation other than railroads.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b420-12\">If Congress can rely on truck-rail competition to obviate the need for regulation, surely the ICC can do so as well. This is especially so in light of the congressional policy \u201cto minimize the need for Federal regulatory control over the rail transportation system.\u201d 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 10,101a(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b420-13\">Moreover, in considering truck-rail competition, the ICC was following the accepted antitrust definition of a \u201cproduct market\u201d: Two products belong in a single product market if they are \u201cregarded by consumers as ... close substitutes.\u201d 2 P. Areeda &amp; D. Turner, <em>Antitrust Law </em>\u00b6 52a (1978).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> If truck and rail transport are good substitutes for each other in the Montreal-to-New York corridor, it makes no sense in terms of antitrust policy to treat them, as Canadian National wants to, as if they were not. We will not lightly impute to Congress an intent to foreclose the ICC from following the antitrust principles incorporated in the antitrust laws.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b420-14\">2. <em>The Existence of Truck Competition</em></p>\n<p id=\"aah-dedup-0\">Canadian National also disputes whether trucks in fact provide strong competition in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>the Montreal-to-New York corridor. We think that substantial evidence supports the Commission\u2019s finding that they do.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-5\">The Commission explained that it relied both on analysis of the principal commodities carried by the Delaware &amp; Hudson and on testimony by shippers:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b421-6\">The commodities the D &amp; H and B &amp; M carry over these routes are generally commodities for which rail service is not considered market dominant. [Guilford] submitted verified statements from [three] shippers of pulp and paper which it serves. [The shippers] all testify that there is motor carrier competition for this traffic.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b421-7\"><em>Delaware &amp; Hudson Merger, </em>366 I.C.C. at 407. Canadian National correctly notes that two of the three shippers cited by the Commission are Maine paper companies who appear to use mostly the Boston &amp; Maine/Delaware &amp; Hudson east-west route.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Thus, only one shipper could testify directly to the existence of truck competition for north-south freight movement.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-8\">Even Canadian National\u2019s witnesses, however, admitted the existence of <em>some </em>truck competition.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Moreover, Canadian National apparently concedes that rail service is not \u201cmarket dominant,\u201d <em>i.e., </em>that the commodities now carried by rail are susceptible to truck competition. <em>See </em>Canadian National Brief at 21 n. 23. Finally, the ICC could properly rely, as Congress did in deregulating railroad rates in 1980, on the well-known fact that railroads carry only about one-third of all intercity freight and that \u201cthe railroads\u2019 decline in market share seems to cut across .. . almost every commodity group.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Putting these various pieces together, we find sufficient support for the ICC\u2019s finding that there is pervasive truck competition for north-south traffic.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-14\">3. <em>Geographic Market</em></p>\n<p id=\"b421-15\">Canadian National also contends that the ICC misanalyzed the relevant \u201cgeographic market\u201d within which competitive effects must be assessed. It points to the ICC\u2019s statement that the Delaware &amp; Hudson line and the Canadian National line \u201cserve different geographic markets and are not perfect substitutes for each other.\u201d <em>Delaware &amp; Hudson Merger, </em>366 I.C.C. at 408. Canadian National argues that if the two lines compete for the same traffic, they are necessarily in the same \u201cgeographic market\u201d as that term is used in antitrust analysis.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b421-16\">This looks to us to be no more than a semantic quibble. Concededly, the Commission used the term \u201cgeographic market\u201d loosely. The two rail lines are in separate geographic markets only for local traffic, and are in the same geographic market for most long-haul traffic. But the ICC unquestionably recognized this. In the same sentence in which the phrase \u201cgeographic market\u201d appears, the Commission explained that the two lines were not \u201cperfect\u201d substitutes; it did not say that they were not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>substitutes at all. Elsewhere in its decision, the ICC stated that the lines \u201ccompete for ... overhead traffic.\u201d Indeed, if the two lines really served entirely separate geographic markets, the Commission\u2019s whole analysis of anticompetitive effects would have been pointless.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-4\">In sum, we find reasonable the Commission\u2019s reliance on truck competition to mitigate any reduction in rail competition.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b422-5\">B. <em>Essential Services</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"abb-dedup-0\">The ICC defines \u201cessential services\u201d as: A service is essential if there is a sufficient public need for the service and adequate alternative transportation is not available.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b422-6\">49 C.F.R. \u00a7 1180.1(c)(2)(ii) (1982). The Commission concluded that Canadian National\u2019s north-south service did not warrant protective conditions because it was not \u201cessential.\u201d Canadian National challenges that conclusion.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b422-7\">The ICC explained that Canadian National\u2019s \u201coverhead\u201d service (\u201coverhead\u201d freight is freight that neither originates nor terminates on a particular line) was not essential \u201cbecause there are other routes over which the traffic can move.\u201d <em>Delaware &amp; Hudson Merger, </em>366 I.C.C. at 420. As for Canadian National\u2019s local service, Canadian National had developed no evidence that this service was essential either:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b422-8\">[Canadian National] has not shown that any of the shippers located on its line cannot be served by truck. Nowhere in the record has it been shown that any of the customers would go out of business if [Canadian National\u2019s] rail service would be terminated. There is absolutely no evidence with regard to prevailing rates in its corridors. There is no analysis as to whether the commodities carried are market dominant commodities. Thus the service it provides cannot be deemed essential.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b422-13\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b422-14\">We understand the Commission to be suggesting several types of evidence that Canadian National might have offered, but did not, to show that alternate service was inadequate: evidence on \u201cprevailing rates\u201d for rail and truck service; evidence on whether rail service is \u201cmarket dominant\u201d for the commodities that Canadian National carries; and evidence on whether shippers would go out of business if they lose rail service. Canadian National does not object to the ICC\u2019s assessment of the evidence.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> It asserts that the Commission should have required Guilford to prove that alternate service was adequate, instead of requiring Canadian National to prove that alternate service was inadequate.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b422-15\">We have no trouble upholding the Commission\u2019s approach. Especially in an expedited proceeding such as this one,<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> the Commission can reasonably expect a party seeking protective conditions to make a pri-ma facie case on why it needs them. Prevailing rates are obviously relevant to the question whether truck service is an adequate substitute for rail. Market dominance is also clearly relevant. If rail service is not market dominant for a particular commodity, that suggests that most ship<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>pers who ship or receive that commodity can switch to truck without incurring serious harm. Cf. 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 10,709(a) (\u201c \u2018market dominance\u2019 means an absence of effective competition from other carriers or modes of transportation\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b423-5\">The Commission\u2019s reference to shippers being forced out of business is more troublesome. We hold today in <em>Lamoille Valley, </em>711 F.2d at 310-313, that the Commission cannot <em>equate </em>the ability of shippers to stay in business with the existence of adequate alternative transportation. But adequacy is a matter of degree. The fact that no shippers will go out of business, although insufficient to <em>prove </em>that alternate service is adequate, is relevant evidence on the question of adequacy because it places a rough upper limit on the cost difference between truck and rail. Thus, the Commission did not err in giving at least some weight to this factor.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-6\">In sum, the ICC reasonably concluded that Canadian National failed to establish a significant probability that its services were essential.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b423-7\">III. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b423-8\">The ICC reasonably concluded that Canadian National\u2019s north-south rail service is neither essential to local shippers nor needed to provide effective competition to Guil-ford\u2019s north-south service. For the reasons given in <em>Lamoille Valley, </em>we <em>remand </em>on the issue of downgrading of interchange service at Danville and Yarmouth Junctions, Maine. In all other respects, the Commission\u2019s decision approving Guilford\u2019s acquisition of the Delaware &amp; Hudson and denying Canadian National\u2019s request for protective conditions is <em>affirmed.</em></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b416-15\">.

Canadian National\u2019s co-petitioners \u2014 Central Vermont Railway and Grand Trunk Western Railroad \u2014 are wholly-owned subsidiaries of Canadian National. We use the name \u201cCanadian National\u201d to refer to any and all of these railroads.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b417-11\">. The ICC defines \u201cclass I\u201d railroads as those railroads with annual operating revenues of $50 million or more. 49 C.F.R. \u00a7 1240.1(a) (1982). Under that definition, the Maine Central, the Boston &amp; Maine, and the Delaware &amp; Hudson are all class I railroads.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b417-16\">. Canadian Pacific also sought protective conditions before the ICC and petitioned this court for review, but later made its separate peace with Guilford and withdrew its petition for review. Conrail also sought various conditions before the ICC but did not petition this court for review.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b418-6\">. Canadian National raises one other claim that was addressed in <em>Lamoille Valley </em>and can be disposed of quickly. Canadian National argues that the expedited procedural schedule used by the ICC in considering the merger was a \u201crule\u201d within the meaning of the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 551(4), 553, and was improperly issued without notice and comment. For the reasons given in <em>Lamoille Valley, </em>711 F.2d at 326-329, we hold that the schedule is exempt from the APA\u2019s notice and comment requirements as a \u201crule[ ] of agency ... procedure.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 553(b)(A).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b418-7\">. The ICC asserts that since the Northeast Rail Service Act of 1981 (NERSA), \u00a7 1164(a), 45 U.S.C. \u00a7 1112(b), required the ICC to issue a decision on Guilford\u2019s proposal to acquire the Delaware &amp; Hudson within 180 days \u201cwith or without a hearing,\u201d a hearing was not required by statute and therefore the standard of review is \u201carbitrary and capricious,\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706(2)(A), rather th\u00e1n \u201csubstantial evidence,\u201d <em>id. </em>\u00a7 706(2)(E). We need not decide whether Congress, in enacting NERSA, meant to change the well-established substantial evidence standard for review of ICC merger decisions, for any possible difference between the two standards of review would not affect our decision in either this case or <em>Lamoille Valley.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b419-9\">.
