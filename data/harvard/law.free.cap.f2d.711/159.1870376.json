Campbell was informed and understood before entering his guilty pleas that the maximum sentence for Count I was five years, a $5,000 fine or both; for Count II, ten years, a $10,000 fine or both; and for Count III, five years, a $25,000 fine or both. The district judge sentenced Campbell to a two-year period of incarceration on Count II, five years\u2019 suspended sentence on Count III and five years on probation and a fine in the amount of $10.00 on Count I.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-18\">Campbell filed a motion to reduce sentence under Rule 35. The basis of the motion is that Campbell\u2019s incarceration had caused extreme hardship \u2014 financial, emotional and otherwise \u2014 to his wife and children and that the family assets had been depleted. The government did not oppose Campbell\u2019s motion to reduce, but the district court denied the motion, noting that Campbell\u2019s expected parole date was 18 to 20 months from the time he began serving his sentence and the typical parole release date for similar offenses was 16 to 20 months greater.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-19\">A Rule 35 motion is addressed to the trial judge\u2019s discretion and its denial is reversible on appeal only when the sentence is illegal or when the trial court\u2019s refusal to reduce the sentence constitutes .a gross abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Nerren, </em>613 F.2d 572, 573 (5th Cir.1980).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Campbell argues that it was an abuse of discretion for the trial court to deny his Rule 35 motion because it was unopposed by the government. No authority exists to support such a contention. As a matter of fact, in this instance it is reasonable to conclude that the plea agreement the government made would foreclose opposition to a motion to reduce. <em>United States v.
