Dougherty (Dougherty) and John F. Lehman, Secretary of the Navy (\u201cSecretary\u201d) appeal from orders of the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, filed May 12 and July 9, 1982, granting, in part, Dough-erty\u2019s petition for an award of attorney\u2019s fees pursuant to the Equal Access to Justice Act (\u201cEAJA\u201d), 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2412 (Supp. IV 1980). Dougherty contends that the district court abused its discretion by granting him an award of $2,130.37, rather than the $14,-197.50 Dougherty had sought. The Secretary, on the other hand, contends that the district court erred, as a matter of law, in awarding Dougherty attorney\u2019s fees at all.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-12\">We dismiss Dougherty\u2019s appeal for lack of jurisdiction. Further, we hold that the Secretary, even though not succeeding in full on the merits, was \u201csubstantially justified\u201d in opposing Dougherty\u2019s claim. We, therefore, reverse the district court\u2019s order granting Dougherty attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-13\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-14\">On November 22, 1980, when Dougherty was in his final year at the United States Naval Academy (\u201cAcademy\u201d), he and four other male midshipmen engaged in sexual relations with a female midshipman in Dougherty\u2019s room, in violation of Academy disciplinary rules. As a result of this incident, the Academy filed charges against Dougherty. After consulting with his military counsel, Dougherty waived his right to an Administrative Conduct Hearing and, on December 3, 1980 pleaded guilty to charges of conduct unbefitting an officer of the Naval Service and of aiding, counseling, and procuring the commission of an offense. <em>Dougherty v. Lehman, </em>688 F.2d 158,159 (3d Cir.1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b641-17\">By an order dated January 14, 1981, the Secretary discharged Dougherty, as well as another male midshipman also involved in the incident, from the Academy. The Secretary further ordered both men to report to the United States Naval Base in Washington, D.C. by 9 A.M., January 15,1981 for assignment to the fleet as enlisted men (App. at 4), for a period of three years. The woman involved was allowed to resign without an active duty order. The remaining male midshipmen were permitted to remain at the Academy, but were otherwise disciplined. <em>Id., </em>688 F.2d at 160.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-18\">On January 14,1981, hours before Dough-erty was required to report for active duty, Dougherty filed suit in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania seeking a temporary restraining order and injunctive relief alleging a violation of his constitutional due process rights, as well as a failure to follow the statutory requirements attending discharge. Following trial on June 2, 1981, the district court upheld the Secretary\u2019s right to discharge Dougherty from the Academy.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The court, however, enjoined the Secretary from ordering Dougherty to active duty. An appeal from the Secretary followed, and this court affirmed the district court, but on different grounds. <em>Dougherty v. Lehman, supra, </em>688 F.2d 158, 161 n. 2. Neither the district court nor this court, when it reviewed the district court\u2019s actions, reached <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number>Dougherty\u2019s constitutional claim. Rather, the disposition in both courts rested on statutory grounds, albeit on different theories.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-4\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-5\">On December 29, 1981, Dougherty submitted a fee petition which had been amended to include details of time and costs. This schedule was prepared, in part, from attorney Malloy\u2019s reconstructed time records.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> It recited an aggregate of 167.9 hours expended by these attorneys over the course of the proceeding and sought $14,-197.50.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-6\">By Memorandum Opinion and Order filed May 12* 1982 the district court granted Dougherty\u2019s motion but reduced the amount claimed to an award of $2,130.37 in total. First, the district court held that the provisions of the Equal Access to Justice Act were applicable because Dougherty\u2019s case was \u201cpending\u201d on October 1, 1981.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>See </em>P.L. 96-481, 94 Stat. 2330, \u00a7 208.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The court also found that Dougherty was a prevailing party within the meaning of the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-7\">The district court, following the procedures established in <em>Lindy I, </em>and <em>Lindy II,</em><footnotemark><em>5</em></footnotemark><em> </em>then examined the time sheets of the attorneys and reduced the time allowable to Malloy to 25.3 hours. Stouffer\u2019s allowable time was reduced to 9.2 hours. The district court disallowed payment for the services of a third attorney. Out-of-pocket costs were disallowed because \u201cthe itemization does not show that the costs were directly related to the prevailing issue.\u201d The court then further reduced the award by 25% because of its estimate of the quality of the attorney\u2019s work product.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-13\">On May 17, 1982 the Secretary filed a motion for reconsideration, arguing that reconsideration was necessary primarily because the Secretary\u2019s position was \u201csubstantially justified,\u201d within the meaning of the EAJA, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2412. However, before the court ruled on the Secretary\u2019s reconsideration motion, Dougherty, on June 7, 1982, filed a notice of appeal from the May 12, 1982 order.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-14\">On June 9, 1982, the district court filed a supplemental decision affirming its Order of May 12, 1982. The court found that the Secretary had failed to meet its burden of proving that its position was substantially justified, as required under the Act. Thereafter, on July 9, 1982, the Secretary filed his notice of \u201ccross-appeal.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b642-15\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-16\">On appeal, Dougherty argues that the district court abused its discretion in setting the amount of attorney\u2019s fees and costs to be awarded Dougherty, and that the court\u2019s calculation of the amount of the fees was arbitrary and contrary to the law of this circuit. We do not reach the merits of this argument. Because the only notice of appeal that Dougherty filed, was filed from the May 12, 1982 order, and because that order was not appealable once a motion for reconsideration was properly filed, Dougherty\u2019s notice of appeal with respect to the May 12 order must, therefore, be deemed a nullity. <em>Griggs v. Provident Consumer Discount Co., </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 103 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"559\">*559</page-number>S.Ct. 400, 403, 74 L.Ed.2d 225 (1982); see Fed.R.App.P. 4(a)(4) (1982). Because Dougherty did not file a timely notice of appeal after the district court\u2019s June 9,1982 order was filed, we lack jurisdiction over Dougherty\u2019s appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-5\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-6\">Prior to the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Griggs, supra, </em>this court had interpreted Fed.R.App.P. 4(a)(4)<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> to deny jurisdiction only where an appellee could demonstrate that the premature filing of a notice of appeal by the appellant resulted in prejudice to the appellee. <em>See Richerson v. Jones, </em>572 F.2d 89 (3d Cir.1978); cf. <em>Cape May Greene, Inc. v. Warren, </em>698 F.2d 179 (3d Cir.1983). Indeed, this court reiterated this construction of Fed.R.App.P. 4(a)(4) in <em>Griggs v. Provident Consumer Discount Corp., </em>680 F.2d 927 (3d Cir.) rev\u2019d \u2014 U.S. \u2014, 103 S.Ct. 400, 74 L.Ed.2d 225 (1982). In that case we accepted jurisdiction despite the fact that the appellant had filed his notice of appeal while a Motion for Reconsideration and a Motion to Alter, Amend and Vacate Judgment (Fed.R.Civ.P. 59(e)) was pending before the district court. <em>Id., </em>680 F.2d at 929-30. We concluded that the appellant\u2019s notice of appeal had been prematurely filed under Rule 4(a)(4), \u201cbut though a premature notice of appeal is subject to dismissal, we have generally allowed appellant to proceed unless the appellee can show prejudice resulting from the premature filing of the notice, [citations].... In our case, the Griggses have shown no prejudice by the premature filing of a notice of appeal.\u201d <em>Id., </em>680 F.2d at 929, n. 2; <em>see </em>discussion in <em>Griggs, supra, </em>103 S.Ct. at 402-03; <em>Tose v. First Pennsylvania Bank, N.A., </em>648 F.2d 879, 882 n. 2 (3d Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>454 U.S. 893, 102 S.Ct. 390, 70 L.Ed.2d 208 (1981); <em>Hodge v. Hodge, </em>507 F.2d 87, 89 (3d Cir.1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b643-11\">In reversing this court\u2019s judgment in <em>Griggs, supra, </em>the Supreme Court emphasized that, after the 1979 Amendments to the Rules, it was no longer permissible for the district court to retain jurisdiction to decide post trial motions after a notice of appeal was filed because of the very real danger that both the district court and the court of appeals would have the power to modify the same judgment simultaneously. It noted that the \u201c1979 Amendments avoided that potential conflict by depriving the courts of appeals of jurisdiction in such situations.\u201d <em>Griggs, supra, </em>103 S.Ct. at 403. The Supreme Court, therefore, held that a notice of appeal filed during the pendency of a Rule 59 motion \u201cwas not merely defective; it was a nullity,\u201d <em>Id. </em>103 S.Ct. at 403-04. This interpretation of Rule 4(a)(4), the Supreme Court reasoned, was consonant with the purposes underlying the amendment of the rule.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b643-12\">Under the plain language of the current rule, a premature notice of appeal \u2018shall have no effect\u2019; a new notice of appeal \u2018must be filed.\u2019 In short, it is as if no notice of appeal were filed at all. And if no notice of appeal is filed at all, the Court of Appeals lacks jurisdiction to act. It is well settled that the requirement of a timely notice of appeal is \u2018mandatory and jurisdictional.\u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b643-13\"><em>Id. </em>103 S.Ct. at 403. <em>See also </em>9 J. Moore, B. Ward &amp; J. Lucas, <em>Moore\u2019s Federal Practice </em>\u00b6 204.12[1], at 4-65 n. 17 (2d ed. 1982) (effect of a Rule 59 motion on a previously filed notice of appeal: \u201cthe appeal simply self-destructs.\u201d). On remand from the Supreme Court, this court conformed to the Supreme Court\u2019s instruction and dismissed Provident\u2019s appeal. <em>Griggs v. Provident Consumer Discount Co., </em>699 F.2d 642 (3d Cir.1983) (on remand).</p>\n<p id=\"b644-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number>B.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-4\">In the instant case, the district court filed its order granting Dougherty his petition for fees in the amount of $2,130.37 on May 12, 1982. On May 17, the Secretary filed a motion for reconsideration pursuant to Fed. R.Civ.P. 59(e). Thereafter, while decision on the Secretary\u2019s motion was still pending, Dougherty, on June 7,1982, filed a notice of appeal from the May 12, 1982 order. Subsequently, on June 9,1982, the district court denied the Secretary\u2019s motion. Since the Secretary\u2019s motion for reconsideration was pending at the time Dougherty filed his notice of appeal, and no notice of appeal was filed by Dougherty after the district court\u2019s ruling, it is clear that, under <em>Griggs, supra, </em>and Fed.R.App.P. 4(a)(4), Dougherty\u2019s June 7, 1982 notice can not be given effect. Accordingly, Dougherty\u2019s appeal must be dismissed.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b644-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-6\">Under the EAJA, in any civil action brought by or against the United States, a district court must award attorney\u2019s fees and other costs to the prevailing party (other than the United States), unless the court finds that the government has carried its burden of showing that its position was \u201csubstantially justified,\u201d or that special circumstances make an award unjust.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Thus, in deciding whether to award fees under the EAJA the district court must determine which party prevailed, whether the government has carried its requisite burden, and accordingly, whether \u201csubstantial justification\u201d for the government\u2019s position has been demonstrated.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> See <em>generally National Resource Defense Council, Inc. v. EPA, </em>703 F.2d 700 (3d Cir.1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b644-12\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-13\">Here, the district court first determined that Dougherty was not a \u201cprevailing party\u201d within the meaning of the EAJA in his action to enjoin his expulsion from the Naval Academy. Therefore, the court reasoned, he was not entitled to fees and expenses connected to the litigation of that claim. However, the court found that Dougherty was \u201centitled to recover a reasonable attorney\u2019s fee ... for legal services rendered in connection with his claim that the Secretary ... could not legally require him to report for active duty since that [was] the ... issue on which he had prevailed.\u201d Memorandum and Order filed May 12, 1982.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> In essence, the district court held that apportionment among claims was proper under the EAJA, thus anticipating our subsequent holding to that effect in <em>Goldhaber v. Foley, </em>698 F.2d 193,197-98 (3d Cir.1983); <em>cf. Hensley v. Eckerhart, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 103 S.Ct. 1933, 76 L.Ed.2d 40 (1983) (same, in a 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988 (Supp. IV 1980) context).</p>\n<p id=\"b645-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number>The district court, however, made no determination in its May 12, 1982 Memorandum and Order as to whether the Secretary had been \u201csubstantially justified\u201d in opposing Dougherty\u2019s claim that Dougherty could not be required to report for active duty. In its opinion of June 9, 1982, the district court addressed this issue. In that opinion it properly held that the burden of proving \u201csubstantial justification\u201d rested on the government. However, the district court then concluded that the government had failed to carry this burden. Thereupon, the district court affirmed its earlier order granting fees to Dougherty in the sum of $2130.37. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-5\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-6\">The legislative history of the EAJA makes plain that Congress intended that the government have the burden of proving that its action giving rise to the litigation was substantially justified.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b645-7\">[T]he strong deterrents to contesting Government action require that the burden of proof rest with the Government. This allocation of the burden, in fact, reflects a general tendency to place the burden of proof on the party who has readier access to and knowledge of the facts in question. The committee believes that it is far easier for the Government, which has control of the evidence, to prove the reasonableness of its action than it is for a private party to marshall the facts to prove that the Government was unreasonable.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b645-8\">H.R. No. 1418, 96th Cong.2d Sess., at 10, <em>reprinted in </em>1980 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad. News, at 4953, 4989 (hereinafter House Report); <em>see also </em>S.Rep. No. 96-253, 96th Cong., 1st Sess., 1, 6 (1979) (the government must \u201cprove the reasonableness of its action\u201d since it has control of the evidence) (hereinafter Senate Report); <em>Natural Resources Defense Council, supra, </em>703 F.2d at 711; <em>S &amp; H Riggers &amp; Erectors, Inc. v. OSHRC, </em>672 F.2d 426, 430 (5th Cir.1982); <em>Moholland v. Schweiker, </em>546 F.Supp. 383, 386 (D.N.H.1982); <em>Nunes-Correia v. Haig, </em>543 F.Supp. 812, 817 (D.D.C.1982); <em>Photo Data, Inc. v. Sawyer, </em>533 F.Supp. 348, 351-52 (D.D.C.1982). The district court, as we have noted, was thus justified in placing the burden of proving \u201csubstantial justification\u201d on the government.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-10\">However, in its assessment of whether the government carried its requisite burden, the district court erred by imposing too great a burden of proof on the government. Although the EAJA does not define the manner in which the government\u2019s burden of proof must be met, the legislative history reflects a Congressional intent that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b645-11\">The test of whether or not a Government action is substantially justified is essentially one of reasonableness. Where the Government can show that its case had a reasonable basis both in law and fact, no award will be made. In this regard, the strong deterrents to contesting Government action require that the burden of proof rest with the Government.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b645-12\">House Report, <em>supra </em>at 10, U.S.Code Cong. <em>&amp; </em>Ad.News 1980, at 4989.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-13\">Nothing in the Act or its legislative history requires that independent or separate evidence \u2014 distinct from the record of proceedings on the merits \u2014 is required in order to satisfy the government\u2019s burden of proof. Indeed it might be difficult to define what manner of independent proof, apart from the record as developed in the course of the litigation would be required to support the government\u2019s statutory burden of \u201csubstantial justification.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b645-14\">The district court, however, apparently contemplated that more than just the merits record had to be produced and scrutinized in order to determine whether the government\u2019s burden was met. The brief June 9, 1982 memorandum opinion of the district court, after reciting the relevant section of the House Report, concludes with the equivocal statement: \u201cNeither the brief, nor any of the pleadings, contain <em>any evidence </em>from which the court can conclude that defendants [sic] have met the burden of proof under this Act, that the factual and legal basis for their [sic] position was substantially justified.\u201d (emphasis sup<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>plied). We cannot agree with the district court\u2019s conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-4\">While the arguments of the parties, and any evidence introduced in the fees action, such as affidavits, must be carefully considered, it is essentially the relevant portions of the record in the underlying action which must be looked to in order to determine if the government has proved \u201csubstantial justification\u201d for its position. <em>See e.g., S &amp; H Riggers, supra, </em>672 F.2d at 430; <em>Spencer v. NLRB, </em>548 F.Supp. 256, 262 (D.D.C.1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b646-5\">Thus, courts reviewing EAJA petitions for attorney\u2019s fees have based their determinations of \u201csubstantial justification\u201d on the factors and reasoning found in the merits opinions of the district courts, as well as on an examination of the relevant documents filed by the parties at every stage of the litigation. <em>See Spencer, supra, </em>548 F.Supp. at 262-64; <em>Moholland, supra, </em>546 F.Supp. at 386; <em>Nunes-Correia, supra, </em>543 F.Supp. at 818-819; <em>Wolverton v. Schweiker, </em>533 F.Supp. 420, 425 (D.Idaho 1982); <em>Photo Data, Inc., supra, </em>533 F.Supp. at 352. Courts have also relied upon decisions rendered in appellate proceedings in the underlying case on the merits. <em>See S &amp; H Riggers, supra, </em>672 F.2d at 430-31. Finally, courts have reviewed the actions taken by the government after legal proceedings had commenced, to the extent that these actions might bear on the question of substantial justification. <em>See Operating Engineers Local Union No. 3 v. Bohn, </em>541 F.Supp. 486, 496 (D.Utah 1982). Accordingly, to the extent that the district court\u2019s reference in its June 9, 1982 opinion to \u201cevidence\u201d may be construed as requiring separate, distinct, or independent \u201cevidence\u201d of \u201csubstantial justification,\u201d we reject such a requirement. As we discuss in a later portion of this opinion, it is sufficient if the record developed in the merits proceedings reveals that the government\u2019s position had a \u201creasonable basis both in law and fact.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b646-7\">Therefore we hold that the district court erred by requiring more than this of the government. Because a reasonable basis in law and fact can be demonstrated by no more than the underlying record on the merits, careful review of that record is all that is required to make a just determination as to whether the government has met its burden of showing \u201csubstantial justification.\u201d <footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Ordinarily, we would remand this case for the district court to determine whether the government met its burden of proof as we have explained that burden in this opinion. However, because we believe that it would be an abuse of discretion for the district court to hold that the government had failed to show that it was \u201csubstantially justified,\u201d we will reach the merits of this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-8\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-9\">As we stated in <em>Goldhaber, supra, </em>698 F.2d at 195, the EAJA was enacted to \u201cremove an obstacle to contesting unreasonable governmental action through litigation\u201d posed by the expense involved in securing the vindication of a party\u2019s rights in the courts. The EAJA therefore provided for an award of attorney\u2019s fees and expenses to parties prevailing against the United States. See House Report, <em>supra, </em>at 5, 9, 1980 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News, at 4984, 4988. Congress, however, did not intend to award fees to every prevailing party against the United States through the EAJA. Rather, Congress authorized only \u201ccertain prevailing parties\u201d to recover fees. House Report, <em>supra, </em>at 6, 1980 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News, at 4984. Specifically, Congress required that attorney\u2019s fees be awarded to a prevailing party unless the court determines that the government\u2019s position was not \u201csubstantially justified.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b646-10\">Nor did Congress leave the term \u201csubstantial justification\u201d unexplained. Indeed, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>the legislative history of the EAJA attempted to explore the nature of the \u201csubstantial justification\u201d limitation which controlled the award of attorney\u2019s fees under the EAJA. Starting from the premise that the government will not be assessed for awards where its (the government\u2019s) case has a \u201creasonable basis both in law and fact,\u201d the House Report continued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b647-4\">Certain types of case dispositions may indicate that the Government action was not substantially justified. A court should look closely at cases, for example, where there has been a judgment on the pleadings or where there is a directed verdict or where a prior suit on the same claim had been dismissed. Such cases clearly raise the possibility that the Government was unreasonable in pursuing the litigation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b647-5\">The standard, however, should not be read to raise a presumption that the Government position was not substantially justified, simply because the Government lost the case. <em>Nor, in fact, does the standard require the Government to establish that its decision to litigate was based on a substantial probability of prevailing. </em>Furthermore, the Government should not be held liable where \u201cspecial circumstances would make an award unjust.\u201d This \u201csafety valve\u201d helps to insure that the Government is not deterred from advancing in good faith the novel but credible extensions and interpretations of the law that often underlie vigorous enforcement efforts. It also gives the court discretion to deny awards where equitable considerations dictate an award should not be made.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b647-8\">House Report, <em>supra, </em>at 10-11, 1980 U.S. Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News, at 4989-90 (emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b647-9\">While the application of the facts and law of a particular case to the statutory standard of \u201csubstantial justification\u201d is not easily made, and courts have disagreed when called upon to review district court determinations in this respect, at least in this Circuit the <em>standard </em>by which fee awards against the Government have been measured is not subject to dispute. In <em>Natural Resources Defense Council, supra, </em>the most recent authority of this court discussing the EAJA, although the members of that panel were in disagreement as to the interpretation of other aspects of the EAJA, all members of the court were in agreement that the \u201csubstantial justification\u201d standard constituted a middle ground between an automatic award of fees to a prevailing party and an award made only when the government\u2019s position was frivolous. <em>See Natural Resources Defense Council, supra, </em>703 F.2d at 708, 711 (opinion announcing the judgment of the court); <em>id. </em>at 714r-15 (concurring opinion); <em>id. </em>at 719 (concurring and dissenting opinion).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b647-10\">From the legislative history and the cases construing that legislation to date, we have been instructed that the standard prescribed essentially is one of reasonableness,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> not in terms of result, but in terms of whether the government\u2019s position, even though unsuccessfully taken, had a \u201creasonable basis both in law and fact.\u201d <em>Natural </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number><em>Resource Defense Council, supra, </em>703 F.2d 700; <em>see S &amp; H Riggers &amp; Erectors, supra, </em>672 F.2d at 429-30; <em>Spencer v. NLRB, supra, </em>548 F.Supp. at 261; <em>Operating Engineers Local Union No. 3, supra, </em>541 F.Supp. at 494-95; <em>Wolverton </em>v. <em>Schweiker, supra, </em>533 F.Supp. at 425; <em>Berman v. Schweiker, </em>531 F.Supp. 1149, 1154 (N.D.Ill.1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b648-4\">The precedents and legislative history reflecting this standard and this interpretation are discussed in <em>Natural Resource Defense Council, supra, </em>and we see no reason to repeat that discussion here. Suffice it to say, from those teachings, we are satisfied that for the government to show that its position had a \u201creasonable basis in both law and fact\u201d it must:</p>\n<p id=\"b648-5\">First, show that there is a reasonable basis in truth for the facts alleged in the pleadings. If no such basis for the government\u2019s factual allegations exist, then the government\u2019s position may well be held not to be \u201csubstantially justified.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b648-6\">Second, the government must show that there exists a reasonable basis in law for the theory which it propounds. This is not to say that the government need demonstrate that there is a substantial probability that the legal theory advanced by it will succeed. See House Report, <em>supra, </em>at 11, 1980 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News, at 4490.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-7\">Finally, the government must show that the facts alleged will reasonably support the legal theory advanced.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Thus, having met these requirements, if the government\u2019s legal theory, as applied to the facts, reasonably supports the Secretary\u2019s position, even though the government may not have ultimately prevailed, then the government will have proven that the \u201cposition of. the United States was substantially justified.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2412(d)(1)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b648-8\">D.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-9\">Applying the above standard to the present controversy, we conclude that the district court erred in determining that the Secretary\u2019s position was not \u201csubstantially justified.\u201d A review of the record on the merits reveals that the facts alleged by the Secretary in his pleadings had a reasonable basis in truth, that the Secretary\u2019s interpretation of the law had a reasonable basis in theory, and that the facts alleged supported the legal theory advanced.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-12\">1.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-13\">It is clear that the Secretary\u2019s actions in this case had a reasonable basis in fact. Indeed there was little dispute about the facts involved. <em>See Dougherty v. Lehman, supra, </em>688 F.2d at 159.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-14\">Dougherty had pleaded guilty to charges of conduct unbecoming an officer of the Naval Service and of aiding, counseling, and procuring the commission of an offense. <em>See Dougherty </em>v. <em>Lehman, supra, </em>688 F.2d at 159. Dougherty did not deny that he had been involved in the incident of November 22, 1980. <em>See </em>Memorandum Opinion and Order, <em>Dougherty v. Lehman, </em>filed February 13,1981. App. at 48. The Secretary discharged Dougherty from the Naval Academy and ordered Dougherty and a fellow midshipman to active duty as enlisted men on the basis of their involvement in the November 22 incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-15\">Further, Dougherty had not been the first midshipman ever to be ordered to the fleet for active duty upon his discharge from the Academy. The Secretary, thus, did not seek to assert a new interpretation of the extent of his authority. Rather, the Secretary applied a long standing interpretation of his authority under the statutes and the regulations when he fashioned his active duty order in this case. <em>See Dougherty v. Lehman, supra, </em>688 F.2d at 164 &amp; n. 7; Department of Defense Directive 1332.-32 \u00b6 V.A.2; Bureau of Naval Personnel Manual, art. 3850400, \u00b6\u00b6 3, 6.b(4), 7.d.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>light of the facts known to the Secretary in this case, and his prior application of the governing regulations to cases of discharge from the Naval Academy, the Secretary\u2019s action \u2014 ordering Dougherty to report for active duty as an enlisted man \u2014 cannot be appropriately characterized as other than having a reasonable basis in fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-5\">2.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-6\">Turning to the second part of the \u201csubstantial justification\u201d test, an examination of the proceedings in the district court, and on appeal, clearly reveals that the Secretary\u2019s position also had a reasonable basis in law. The Secretary, in defending the legality of his action, has consistently relied on Naval regulations in interpreting 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 6959 (1976), the statutory basis of the Secretary\u2019s power to impose the active duty requirement.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> On the basis of that provision, the Secretary asserted that he had the power to order Dougherty to active duty upon his discharge from the Naval Academy, whether or not Dougherty willfully provoked that discharge.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b649-7\">Despite this assertion of authority by the Secretary, the district court disagreed with the Secretary\u2019s interpretation of the statute and regulations in their application to Dougherty\u2019s case. Rather, the district court noted that the Secretary could impose the active duty requirement only in the face of a willful violation of the agreement required of every midshipman under 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 6959(a). The district court, however, did not base its order on this aspect of statutory interpretation, but granted Dougherty\u2019s motion for a permanent injunction based on the fact that the Secretary had failed to produce Dougherty\u2019s 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 6959(a) agreement in court.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> <em>See </em>Memorandum and Order, filed July 8, 1981, App. at 61.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-15\">On appeal, the Secretary continued to press his assertion that 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 6959 gave him the authority to order Dougherty to active duty. <em>Dougherty v. Lehman, supra, </em>688 F.2d at 164-65. This Court affirmed the order of the district court, but on completely different grounds. After extensive review of the legislative history of 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 6959, we held that the Secretary had no authority to order midshipmen to active duty once a midshipman was separated from the Naval Academy by action of the Secretary. <em>Id. </em>at 164. We accordingly rejected the Secretary\u2019s legal argument that 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 6959(a)\u2019s \u201csooner separated\u201d clause must be construed to mean sepa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>ration from the Naval Service.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> But in so doing, the theory on which the district court relied was also rejected.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-4\">Indeed, a reading of this court\u2019s decision in <em>Dougherty v. Lehman, supra, </em>688 F.2d 159, makes it clear that the Secretary\u2019s interpretation of his power under 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 6959 \u2014 an interpretation to which at least one other court has agreed, <em>see Green v. Lehman, </em>544 F.Supp. 260, 264 (D.Md.1982) \u2014presented an exceedingly close question of law. Furthermore, even though this court denied the Secretary\u2019s Petition for Rehearing <em>in banc, </em>which had been filed on October 12, 1982, the arguments and precedents therein cited make a strong case for his interpretation of the statute, regulations, and his authority \u2014 thus, his \u201cposition.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b650-5\">We acknowledge that the Secretary\u2019s interpretation was ultimately rejected. Such a rejection, however, is not enough to support Dougherty\u2019s argument that the Government\u2019s position was, as a consequence, not \u201csubstantially justified.\u201d Congress has made it quite evident that the \u201csubstantial justification\u201d standard \u201cshould not be read to raise a presumption that the government was not substantially justified, simply because it lost the case.\u201d House Report, <em>supra, </em>at 11,1980 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News, at 4990.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-6\">3.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-7\">We are satisfied, from our review of all the underlying proceedings, that the Secretary\u2019s position \u2014 that he had authority to order Dougherty to active duty \u2014 had a \u201creasonable basis both in law and fact,\u201d and that, without more, the Secretary has made the \u201cstrong showing\u201d of \u201csubstantial justification\u201d required to meet his statutory burden of proof. <em>Natural Resources Defense Council, supra, </em>703 F.2d at 712. It follows, of course, that the district court erred in concluding otherwise. As a consequence, Dougherty is not entitled to attorney\u2019s fees and other costs under the EAJA, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2412(d)(1)(A).<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b650-12\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-13\">Dougherty\u2019s appeal at No. 82-1360 will be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> The June 9,1982 order of the district court from which the Secretary\u2019s appeal, at No. 82-1418 was taken, and which order granted, in part, Dougherty\u2019s petition for attorney\u2019s fees and costs, will be reversed and remanded with directions to the district court to vacate its June 9, 1982 order and to deny Dougherty\u2019s petition for fees and costs.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b641-15\">.
