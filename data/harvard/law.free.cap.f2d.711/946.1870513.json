P, app. 2 (1982). Charles C. Winn appeals from a district court judgment upholding the Secretary\u2019s termination of the benefits he had been receiving. We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b1030-20\">The validity of the guidelines themselves is not in question here. <em>See Heckler v. </em>Campbell, \u2014 U.S. \u2014 , 103 S.Ct. 1952, 76 L.Ed.2d 66 (1983). Rather, Winn challenges the particular determination under the guidelines that he was not disabled.</p>\n<p id=\"b1030-23\">The Administrative Law Judge made the. following findings, which set out Winn\u2019s age, education, prior work experience, and the nature of his claimed disability:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1031-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"947\">*947</page-number>1. The claimant was found to be disabled within the meaning of the Social Security Act beginning October 16, 1976.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1031-3\">2. The claimant\u2019s impairment was degenerative disc disease, L5 to SI.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1031-4\">3. The medical evidence shows that by October 1978 the claimant\u2019s impairment had improved.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1031-5\">4. The claimant is unable to perform past relevant work as battery repairman, lumberyard employee and head school custodian.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1031-6\">5. As of October 1978, the claimant had at least sufficient residual functional capacity for at least sedentary work as defined in Section 404.1510(b), Regulations No. 4.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1031-7\">6. Claimant\u2019s subjective complaints of pain are not deemed sufficiently credible to support a finding that disability continued after October 1978.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1031-8\">7. The claimant' is 50 years old and has a 9th grade education.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1031-16\"><em>The claimant\u2019s work as head custodian at a school imparted skills that are transferable to work other than that previously performed. </em>8.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1031-10\">9. Rule 201.11, Table No. 1, Appendix 2, Subpart P, Regulations No. 4, on the basis of residual functional capacity, age, education and work experience, directs that claimant be found no longer disabled as of October 1978.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1031-11\">10. By October 1978 the claimant was no longer under a \u2018disability\u2019 as defined in the Social Security Act, as amended.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1031-12\">Rec., vol. II, at 13-14 (emphasis added). The ALJ applied Table No. 1 of the medical-vocational guidelines, 20 C.F.R. pt. 404, subpt. P, app. 2 (1982), and concluded that Winn was not disabled.</p>\n<p id=\"b1031-13\">Table No. 1 of the guidelines applies to claimants found capable of performing sedentary work. The relevant portion applicable to claimants closely approaching advanced age with limited education provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1031-17\">Rule Age Education Previous work experience Decision</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AOM\">201.09 Closely approaching advanced age. Limited or less. Unskilled or none. Disabled.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AfeK\">201.10 do. do. Skilled or semiskilled\u2014 skills not transferable. do.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"alm-dedup-0\">201.11 do. do. Skilled or semiskilled\u2014 skills transferable. Not disabled.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1031-41\">20 C.F.R. pt. 404, subpt. P, app. 2, Table 1 (1982) (emphasis added). The finding that Winn possessed transferable skills was thus critical to the ALJ\u2019s determination that Winn was not disabled.</p>\n<p id=\"b1031-42\">As we recently noted,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1031-43\">\u201cthe role of this Court is to determine on the entire record whether the Secretary\u2019s finding is supported by \u2018substantial evidence.\u2019 <em>Lovett v. Schweiker, </em>667 F.2d 1 (5th Cir.1981); <em>Cagle v. Califano, </em>638 F.2d 219 (10th Cir.1981). \u2018Substantial evidence\u2019 is more than a \u2018mere scintilla\u2019 of evidence. <em>Richardson v. Perales, </em>402 U.S. 389, 401, 91 S.Ct. 1420 [1427, 28 L.Ed.2d 842], <em>Smith v. Schweiker, </em>646 F.2d 1075, 1083 (5th Cir.1981). It is evidence which a reasonable mind would accept as being <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"948\">*948</page-number>adequate to support a conclusion. <em>Richardson v. Perales, </em>402 U.S. at 401, 91 S.Ct. at 1427; <em>Smith v. Schweiker, </em>646 F.2d at 1083.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1032-4\"><em>Cavitt </em>v. <em>Schweiker, </em>704 F.2d 1193, 1194 (10th Cir.1983) (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1032-5\">The evidence of Winn\u2019s \u201ctransferable skills\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> is meager at best. The ALJ\u2019s entire findings with respect to Winn\u2019s skills are: \u201cHis relevant work experience has been as a battery repairman, lumber company employee and head custodian at a school. The latter position involved supervision of 18 or 19 people and is regarded as skilled work with transferable skills.\u201d Rec., vol. II, at 11. The ALJ failed to specify any skills he believed Winn had gained from his experience. The only support for the conclusion that Winn has transferable skills from his position as head custodian is a handwritten response on a Medical History Report that Winn completed in May 1977. To the instruction \u201cDescribe the duties of your usual job in your own words,\u201d he responded: \u201cClean and repair school equipment. As head custodian I supervised 18 or 19 people.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 75. However, in a Vocational Report completed in August 1978, Winn checked \u201cNo\u201d when asked if he had had supervisory responsibilities in his job. <em>Id. </em>at 93. He also indicated he had not used technical knowledge or skills. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1032-12\">At the hearing in January 1981, the paralegal who was representing Winn asked him to describe a typical day at work. He testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1032-13\">\u201cWell, the first thing every morning I made sure that there was heat in the building in the wintertime, of course. And I kept the entire plant running. Did some cleaning. Did some yard work. In the wintertime I\u2019d plowed out the snow.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1032-14\">\n<em>u</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1032-15\">\u201cAnd, you know, just general building maintenance would probably cover it just as well as anything I could say.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1032-16\"><em>Id. </em>at 32. Although the ALJ also questioned Winn, he asked nothing about his job skills. There is no evidence to explain the inconsistency between Winn\u2019s statements that he supervised 18 or 19 people and that he had no supervisory skills. Assuming the first statement is correct, there is no hint in the record as to the nature of the supervisory skills of the head custodian of a high school in Libertyville, Illinois. On this record, we do not see how a reasonable mind could conclude that Winn has transferable skills.</p>\n<p id=\"b1032-17\">The finding that Winn has skills transferable to sedentary work is not supported by substantial evidence. Consequently, the vocational guideline was incorrectly applied. We remand so that the Secretary may develop a better record on the issue of transferable skills and reconsider Winn\u2019s claim.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"949\">*949</page-number><em>See Vazquez v. Secretary of Health &amp; Human Services, </em>683 F.2d 1, 4-5 (1st Cir.1982); <em>Hall v. Harris, </em>658 F.2d 260, 266-67 (4th Cir.1981); <em>Decker v.

The regulations provide:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1032-7\">\u201c(d) <em>Skills that can be used in other work (transferability). </em>(1) <em>What we mean by transferable skills. </em>We consider you to have skills that can be used in other jobs, when the skilled or semi-skilled work activities you did in past work can be used to meet the requirements of skilled or semi-skilled work activities of other jobs or kinds of work. This depends largely on the similarity of occupationally significant work activities among different jobs.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1032-8\">\u201c(2) <em>How we determine skills that can be transferred to other jobs. </em>Transferability is most probable and meaningful among jobs in which\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1032-9\">(i) The same or a lesser degree of skill is required;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1032-10\">(ii) The same or similar tools and machines are used; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1032-11\">(iii) The same or similar raw materials, products, processes, or services are involved.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1032-18\">(3) <em>Degrees of transferability. </em>There are degrees of transferability of skills ranging from very close similarities to remote and incidental similarities among jobs. A complete similarity of all three factors is not necessary for transferability. However, when skills are so specialized or have been acquired in such an isolated vocational setting (like many jobs in mining, agriculture, or fishing) that they are not readily usable in other industries, jobs and work settings, we consider that they are not transferable.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1032-19\">20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1568 (1982).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1032-20\">. On appeal Winn also argues that a remand is justified to enable the Secretary to consider a psychiatric report prepared subsequent to the hearing.
