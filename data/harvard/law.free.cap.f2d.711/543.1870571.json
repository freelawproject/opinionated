(ABI), Harrisburg Drywall and Construction Corp. (Harrisburg Drywall), and Al Bryant Associates, Inc. (Associates) to cease and desist from refusing to bargain collectively with the two charging unions, to recognize the two unions, to apply the relevant bargaining agreement terms to employees of Harrisburg Drywall and Associates, to make those employees whole for loss of earnings or compensation, to reimburse employee trust funds, and to post a specified notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-17\">ABI was formed by Albert Bryant in 1967 and operated as an interior design and finishing contractor, engaged in hanging drywall, installing ceilings and laying floors. During the relevant period, Bryant owned 90% of ABI and served as president; his wife owned the remaining 10% and served as treasurer. Jean Hoffman, the office manager, was the secretary. The office was located in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania in a building owned by the Bryants.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-18\">ABI was a member of the Central Pennsylvania Subcontractors Association (CPSA), which conducted labor negotiations for its employer members and which negotiated agreements with both charging unions, the United Brotherhood of Carpenters &amp; Joiners of America, Carpenters\u2019 District Council of Western Pennsylvania (Western) and Keystone District Council (Keystone). The two unions operate in different geographic areas. The AU found that ABI was bound by these agreements; this fact is apparently not disputed on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-19\">In 1971, a drywall finishing business known as Harrisburg Drywall and Construction Corp. operated by Geno Premici was incorporated, and Bryant acquired 51% ownership and became vice-president and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>secretary. Jean Hoffman, ABI\u2019s secretary, became Harrisburg Drywall\u2019s treasurer. The following year, Bryant became sole owner. In 1975, Bryant selected Charles May, ABI\u2019s field supervisor, to be Harrisburg Drywall\u2019s president. Harrisburg Drywall did not adhere to any labor agreements in performing its work. Bryant used the two companies to maintain a \u201cdouble breasted\u201d operation, one whereby different legal entities in the construction industry with common proprietary and managerial aspects operate separately, one on a union and the other on a nonunion basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-4\">The third corporation, Al Bryant Associates, Inc., was formed in 1979 by Bryant, Larry McClain, ABI\u2019s coordinator, and Jean Hoffman, its office manager, after unfair labor practice charges had been filed against ABI and Harrisburg' Drywall in connection with the nonunion operation of Harrisburg Drywall. McClain became its president, Bryant its treasurer and vice-president in charge of sales, and Hoffman its secretary and vice-president in charge of administration. McClain and Hoffman each contributed $20,000 in cash to Associates and received 35% stock ownership. Bryant contributed all Harrisburg Drywall\u2019s stock, valued at $40,000, for 30% ownership. Associates began operating January 1, 1980, as a subcontractor in the same business as ABI and Harrisburg Drywall.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-5\">This ease centers on the interrelationship between these three entities, and the legal obligations which arise as a result. The unions charged that since respondents constituted a single employer, they violated sections 8(a)(5) and (1) of the National Labor Relations Act by refusing to recognize the charging unions and by refusing to apply to certain Harrisburg Drywall and Associates employees the collective bargaining agreement terms applicable to ABI. The Board\u2019s order was predicated on its findings, in substantial affirmance of the rulings, findings and conclusions of the ALJ, that all three respondents were a single employer, that Harrisburg Drywall was the alter ego of ABI, that Associates was the alter ego and \u201cdisguised continuance\u201d of ABI and Harrisburg Drywall, and that the carpenter employees of all three companies constituted an appropriate unit for collective bargaining purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-7\">The enforcement petition raises the following issues: (1) Were the initial charges filed by Keystone and the charges filed by Western time-barred by section 10(b) of the NLRA? (2) Should the Board have deferred to an arbitration decision made on Keystone\u2019s charges regarding the nonunion operation of Harrisburg Drywall? (3) Does substantial evidence support the Board\u2019s findings of single employer, unit determination, and alter ego? (4) Were respondents deprived of a fair hearing due to the AU\u2019s conduct?</p>\n<p id=\"b630-8\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-9\">TIMELINESS OF THE CHARGES</p>\n<p id=\"b630-10\">Keystone filed its initial charge with the Board on August 10, 1979 in which it complained about Harrisburg Drywall\u2019s failure to honor the Keystone collective bargaining agreement. It charged ABI and Harrisburg Drywall with committing unfair labor practices by \u201chiring non-Union employees in contravention of its obligation under the collective bargaining agreement\u201d and by \u201chaving a non-Union subsidiary and refusing to recognize the Union as a representative of the employees employed by Harrisburg Drywall.\u201d Keystone filed a second unfair labor practice charge on October 6, 1980, after Associates was formed. As amended, the charge alleged the three companies had \u201c[sjince on or about August 1980, ... refused to bargain collectively and in good faith with Keystone.\u201d Western filed its charge on October 3,1979, claiming ABI \u201cd/b/a Harrisburg Drywall\u201d had \u201c[sjince on or about June 1, 1979, and at all times thereafter, ... failed and refused to bargain collectively and in good faith with [Western].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b630-11\">Respondents argue that Western\u2019s charge and Keystone\u2019s initial charge were untimely under section 10(b) of the NLRA, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 160(b), which provides \u201c[tjhat no complaint shall issue based upon any unfair <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>labor practice occurring more than six months prior to the filing of the charge with the Board.\u201d Western knew by about January 1979, more than six months before it filed charges, that Harrisburg Drywall had been awarded a subcontract on a job in Venango County, Pennsylvania, a site within Western\u2019s geographic jurisdiction. A representative of that union telephoned Bryant requesting employment of union personnel and Bryant refused, stating he was doing the job under Harrisburg Drywall. Respondents contend that Bryant thus \u201crepudiated\u201d the contractual duties with respect to employees of Harrisburg Drywall, and that the section 10(b) period began to run when the repudiation was made known to the union.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-5\">The ALJ concluded that the section 10(b) six-month period did not begin until such time as Harrisburg Drywall commenced operations under employment terms distinct from those in the union contract.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The ALJ found that the record did not permit finding that Harrisburg Drywall actually commenced work at the Venango County job by April 3, 1979, the section 10(b) cut-off date for Western. That work apparently commenced about June 1979.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-6\">The ALJ\u2019s conclusion that the charge was timely filed is consistent with well-established legal principles. A statement of intent or threat to commit an unfair practice does not start the statutory six months running. The running of the limitations period can begin only when the unfair labor practice occurs. Thus in <em>NLRB v. Plumbers &amp; Pipe Fitters Local Union 214, </em>298 F.2d 427, 428 (7th Cir.1962), the court held that the actual date of the discharge of the nonunion employee, not the date the union demanded that he be discharged, started the statutory period. Similarly, when an unfair labor practice stemmed from denial of union membership to strikebreakers, the six-month period was counted from the date membership was denied, because that was the first date the employees could have filed their charge. <em>Local 1104, Communications Workers v. NLRB, </em>520 F.2d 411, 415-16 (2d Cir.1975), <em>cert, denied, </em>423 U.S. 1051, 96 S.Ct. 778, 46 L.Ed.2d 639 (1976). Since Western had no basis for filing a charge until work on the Venango County job began, its charge was timely.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-9\">Unlike the situation with Western, the ALJ found that \u201cKeystone was mindful that its members had been employed by Harrisburg Drywall, that Harrisburg Drywall had performed work covered by the CPSA contract, that Harrisburg Drywall had not adhered to the terms of that contract, and that Al Bryant owned Harrisburg Drywall.\u201d The Board concedes that Keystone officials were aware of Harrisburg Drywall\u2019s operation as a nonunion shop within its geographic area more than six months before its August 10, 1979 charge was filed. The ALJ found, however, that respondents\u2019 obligation under the collective bargaining agreement was a continuing one. The fact that the initial repudiation of the agreement occurred more than six months before charges were filed did not absolve respondents from the unfair labor practices which inured from their continuing failure, on demand, to abide by the collective bargaining agreement. The ALJ found such a demand in a letter dated March 19, 1979 from Keystone informing Bryant that Harrisburg Drywall was covered by the applicable agreement and that it was obligated to adhere to its terms. Therefore, the AU found Bryant\u2019s failure to satisfy this demand constituted an independent violation of section 8(a)(5), thus rendering Keystone\u2019s August 10, 1979 charge timely.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-10\">As the respondents recognize, there does not appear to be any clear precedent on when the section 10(b) period begins to run with respect to section 8(a)(5) charges growing out of double breasted operations. Respondents contend that the most nearly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>analogous cases are those where the courts held that the refusal of an employer to execute an individual contract with the union following negotiations of a multiem-ployer pact marked the beginning of the six-month period. <em>See NLRB v. Serv-All Co., </em>491 F.2d 1273 (10th Cir.1974); <em>NLRB v. McCready &amp; Sons, Inc., </em>482 F.2d 872 (6th Cir.1973); <em>NLRB v. Field &amp; Sons, Inc., </em>462 F.2d 748 (1st Cir.1972). <em>But see NLRB v. Strong, </em>386 F.2d 929, 931 (9th Cir.1967), <em>rev\u2019d on other grounds, </em>393 U.S. 357, 89 S.Ct. 541, 21 L.Ed.2d 546 (1969).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> These cases have held a second or subsequent request by the union that the employer sign the agreement cannot support an unfair labor practice charge if the initial request and refusal to sign occurred outside the six-month statutory period. Similarly in <em>NLRB v. Pennwoven, </em>194 F.2d 521 (3d Cir. 1952), we held that a discriminatory failure to recall employees because of their union activities initiated the six-month period. We stated that the fact that the employees wrote within the period demanding reinstatement did not trigger a new violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-4\">The Board, on the other hand, relies on cases holding each refusal to bargain by an employer under a general duty to bargain constitutes a separate violation. In <em>J. Ray McDermott &amp; Co. v. NLRB, </em>571 F.2d 850, 858 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>439 U.S. 893, 99 S.Ct. 250, 58 L.Ed.2d 238 (1978), for example, the court held that the passage of more than six months from one refusal to bargain does not bar action by the Board on a timely complaint based on subsequent refusal. The court reasoned that there was no danger of \u201cstale\u201d claims since a refusal to bargain violation is based on contemporaneous motives. The same principle was accepted in <em>NLRB v. Basic Wire Products, Inc., </em>516 F.2d 261, 267-68 (6th Cir.1975) and <em>Cone Mills Corp. v. NLRB, </em>413 F.2d 445, 448-49 (4th Cir.1969) (applied to employer\u2019s refusal to provide union with information concerning pension plan). In <em>NLRB v. Louisiana Bunkers, Inc., </em>409 F.2d 1295, 1299-1300 (5th Cir.1969), a case involving a single employer, the court found the charge was timely even though the initial refusal to bargain occurred outside the six-month period, because the employer refused subsequent union requests to bargain.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-7\">A decision on how to apply section 10(b) to the facts before us must be made in light of the statute\u2019s underlying policy. The Supreme Court has described the policy of the statutory time limit \u201cto bar litigation over past events \u2018after records have been destroyed, witnesses have gone elsewhere, and recollections of the events in question have become dim and confused\u2019 \u201d and \u201cof course to stabilize existing bargaining relationships.\u201d <em>Local Lodge No. 1424, International Association of Machinists v. NLRB, </em>362 U.S. 411, 419, 80 S.Ct. 822, 828, 4 L.Ed.2d 832 (1960) <em>(Bryan Manufacturing Co.) </em>(quoting H.R.Rep. No. 245, 80th Cong., 1st Sess. 40 (1947)). In <em>Bryan </em>the Court interpreted this section as precluding the filing of an unfair labor charge which was grounded on events predating the limitations period. That is not the situation before us. Here, there will be no need to rely on facts which predate the limitations period. Although there may be some evidentia-ry value to earlier events, this is not a situation \u201cwhere conduct occurring within the limitations period can be charged to be an unfair labor practice only through reliance on an earlier unfair labor practice.\u201d <em>Bryan, </em>362 U.S. at 416-17, 80 S.Ct. at 826-27. The relevant facts will be the interrelationships of the companies at the time of a specific demand to bargain, and these operative facts in no way depend upon any earlier demand to bargain.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-8\">We find support for the Board\u2019s position in the manner in which we applied section 10(b) in our earlier opinion in <em>NLRB v. Erie Marine, Inc., </em>465 F.2d 104 (3d Cir.1972). In that case, a section 8(a)(2) charge was based on a joint employee-employer committee formed in 1969. Although the complaint <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>was not filed until July 22, 1972, we enforced the Board\u2019s order over respondent\u2019s reliance on section 10(b) because we concluded \u201cthat the principal support for the Board\u2019s findings comes from the existence of the Committee and its domination by management <em>within the limitations period.\u2019\u2019 Id. </em>at 108 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b633-5\">Therefore, we believe the section 10(b) limitations period should be applied as it was in the <em>Erie Marine </em>case rather than in those cases cited by the respondents where the employer refused to sign a negotiated contract.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In the refusal to sign cases, the operative fact was a concrete act fixed in time in relationship to the facts surrounding the contract negotiations. As the court noted in <em>McCready, </em>\u201cWith the passage of time, those facts become harder to prove as memories fade and witnesses become unavailable.\u201d 482 F.2d at 875. No such concern is presented by the facts here, since the interrelationship between the entities can be established by reference to their status within the six-month period at the time of the relevant demand.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Here, Keystone asserted its position about Harrisburg Drywall\u2019s collective bargaining obligations in the March 19,1979 letter. Therefore, its charge filed on August 10, 1979 was timely.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-7\">DEFERRAL TO ARBITRATION DECISION</p>\n<p id=\"b633-8\">The March 19, 1979 letter to ABI by Keystone\u2019s counsel asserting Harrisburg Drywall was a \u201csubsidiary\u201d of or \u201cjoint venture\u201d with ABI and that Harrisburg Drywall was obligated to apply the collective bargaining agreement negotiated between CPSA and Keystone resulted in an arbitration proceeding. Keystone presented to the arbitrator both its claim that Harrisburg Drywall, as a subsidiary of ABI, was bound to the CPSA agreement as a matter of contract and its claim that as a matter of federal labor law, the contract was binding on Harrisburg Drywall. The arbitrator found that Harrisburg Drywall was not a \u201csubsidiary\u201d of ABI within the meaning of the collective bargaining agreement and therefore ABI was not in violation of its contractual obligations to Keystone through Harrisburg Drywall\u2019s operation on an open shop basis. Respondents contend that the Board should have deferred to the arbitration decision denying Keystone\u2019s grievance.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-11\">Although not required to do so, <em>see, e.g., Herman Brothers, Inc. v. NLRB, </em>658 F.2d 201, 205-06 (3d Cir.1981); <em>NLRB v. Horn &amp; Hardart Co., </em>439 F.2d 674, 678-79 (2d Cir. 1971), the Board has voluntarily decided not to exercise its plenary jurisdiction over all unfair labor practice charges and to defer to outstanding arbitration awards provided certain conditions were met: the arbitral proceeding was fair and regular, all parties agreed to be bound, and the decision was not repugnant to the purposes and policies of the NLRA. <em>Spielberg Manufacturing Co., </em>112 N.L.R.B. 1080, 1082 (1955). A subsequently enunciated fourth condition, that the arbitrator must have considered and decided the statutory unfair labor practice issue, is the one at issue here. <em>See Raytheon Co., </em>140 N.L.R.B. 883, 884 (1963), <em>enforcement denied on other grounds, </em>326 F.2d 471 (1st Cir.1964).</p>\n<p id=\"b633-12\">In this case, the arbitrator specifically stated that the basic question before him was whether Harrisburg Drywall was a subsidiary under the contract. He further stated his role was \u201climited to interpreting [the contract terms], and it [did] not extend to enforcing the provisions of the Labor Management Relations Act.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b633-13\">The Board decided that deferral was unwarranted. It explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b633-14\">The arbitrator ... found that the NLRB and court cases cited to him by the Union were not enlightening as to the definition <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>of a \u201csubsidiary\u201d and thus he relied on dictionary definitions. Based on the ten- or of the arbitrator\u2019s entire decision, it is clear he did not consider the statutory issue. It is also clear that the arbitrator did not have the same evidence before him as in the instant case. For example, he had neither the employment rosters of Harrisburg Drywall nor any information that Bryant signed bids for Harrisburg Drywall.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b634-4\">We have recently reiterated that we review the Board\u2019s decision not to defer to an arbitration award on an abuse of discretion standard. <em>See United Parcel Service, Inc. v. NLRB, </em>706 F.2d 972, 981 (3d Cir.1983); <em>Herman Brothers, Inc. v. NLRB, </em>658 F.2d at 207; <em>NLRB v. General Warehouse Corp., </em>643 F.2d 965, 970 (3d Cir.1981). Respondents argue that the reasons advanced by the Board are insubstantial, and therefore it abused its discretion. Respondents rely on cases in which the Board deferred to an arbitrator\u2019s decision although the arbitrator did not explicitly resolve the statutory issue. <em>See Atlantic Steel Co., </em>245 N.L.R.B. 814 (1979); <em>Kansas City Star Co., </em>236 N.L. R.B. 866 (1978). In those cases, the Board found the arbitrator considered all the evidence relevant to the statutory issue, and hence implicitly resolved it. In neither of those cases did the arbitrator explicitly decline to resolve the statutory issue, as he did here. Nor, in those cases, did respondents fail to provide significant relevant evidence at the time of arbitration in contrast to the situation here where, as the Board claims, \u201cthe companies refused to produce any subpoenaed documentary evidence concerning Harrisburg Drywall during the arbitration proceeding.\u201d Brief for NLRB at 38 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b634-5\">The requirement that the statutory issues have been presented to and decided by the arbitrator is of particular significance to insure that the Board does not abdicate its responsibility to protect statutory rights. <em>See NLRB v. General Warehouse Corp., </em>643 F.2d at 969. The Board recently reaffirmed it would not defer \u201cunless the unfair labor practice issue before the Board was both presented to and considered by the arbitrator.\u201d <em>Suburban Motor Freight, Inc., </em>247 N.L.R.B. 146, 146-47 (1980). Given the arbitrator\u2019s explicit statement that he was not resolving the statutory issue, and the fact that he did not have all the relevant evidence before him, we cannot hold that the Board abused its discretion in refusing to defer to the arbi-tral award. <em>See Monsanto Chemical Co., </em>130 N.L.R.B. 1097, 1099 (1961) (refusal to defer where arbitrator explicitly declined to pass on statutory issue although submitted to him).</p>\n<p id=\"b634-7\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-8\">THE FINDINGS OF SINGLE EMPLOYER, UNIT DETERMINATION, AND ALTER EGO</p>\n<p id=\"b634-10\">We turn then to the respondents\u2019 challenge on the principal issue decided by the Board, which agreed with the AU\u2019s finding that ABI and Harrisburg Drywall were a single employer, that Harrisburg Drywall was ABI\u2019s alter ego, and that Associates was the alter ego and disguised continuance of its predecessors ABI and Harrisburg Drywall. Because of unique problems in the construction industry, the Board will accept a double breasted operation under certain circumstances. However, an employer will be guilty of a failure to bargain violation for a double breasted operation if the Board finds that both entities are a single employer within the meaning of the NLRA and the combined employees form an appropriate bargaining unit. <em>See South Prairie Construction Co. v. Local No. 627, International Union of Operating Engineers, </em>425 U.S. 800, 96 S.Ct. 1842, 48 L.Ed.2d 382 (1976) (per curiam). The bargaining unit issue need not arise when there has been an alter ego finding, at least in the situation where a successor company is the \u201cdisguised continuance\u201d of its predecessor. In <em>NLRB v. Scott Printing Corp., </em>612 F.2d 783 (3d Cir.1979), we upheld the Board\u2019s finding that a section 8(a)(5) violation could occur where a new employer was found to be the disguised continuance of the old employer without inquiring into the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>appropriateness of the bargaining unit. <em>See also Carpenters Local Union No. 1846 v. Pratt-Farnsworth, Inc., </em>690 F.2d 489, 508-09 (5th Cir.1982) (Board will generally not consider the unit except to the extent it is repugnant to NLRA policy); Comment, <em>Double-Breasted Operations in the Construction Industry: A Search for Concrete Guidelines, </em>6 U. Dayton L.Rev. 45, 47 (1981) (hereafter Dayton Comment).</p>\n<p id=\"b635-5\">A. <em>ABI and Harrisburg Drywall </em>as a <em>Single Employer</em></p>\n<p id=\"b635-6\">Four criteria have been used by the Board in determining whether separate entities constitute a single employer: interrelation of operations, common management, centralized control of labor relations, and common ownership. <em>Radio &amp; Television Broadcast Technicians Local Union 1264 v. Broadcast Service of Mobile, Inc., </em>380 U.S. 255, 256, 85 S.Ct. 876, 877, 13 L.Ed.2d 789 (1965) (per curiam); see <em>also NLRB v. Browning-Ferris Industries of Pennsylvania, Inc., </em>691 F.2d 1117, 1121-22 &amp; 1121 n. 1 (3d Cir.1982); <em>Sakrete of Northern California, Inc. v. NLRB, </em>332 F.2d 902, 905 n. 4 (9th Cir.1964), <em>cert. denied, </em>379 U.S. 961, 85 S.Ct. 649, 13 L.Ed.2d 556 (1965); <em>Parklane Hosiery Co., </em>203 N.L.R.B. 597, 612 (1973). The Board finds no one factor controlling, although it has stressed the first three factors, particularly centralized control of labor relations, which tend to show \u201coperational integration.\u201d <em>Id.; see also NLRB v. Jordan Bus Co., </em>380 F.2d 219, 222 (10th Cir.1967); <em>Parklane Hosiery Co., </em>203 N.L. R. B. at 612. Ultimately, single employer status depends on all the circumstances of the case and is characterized by absence of an \u201carm\u2019s length relationship found among unintegrated companies.\u201d <em>Local No. 627 International Union of Operating Engineers v. NLRB, </em>518 F.2d 1040, 1045-46 (D.C.Cir. 1975), <em>aff\u2019d on this issue per curiam sub nom. South Prairie Construction Co. v.

Ct. 293, 62 L.Ed.2d 306 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b635-9\">The single employer question is primarily factual, and the Board\u2019s conclusion must be upheld if supported by substantial evidence. <em>NLRB v. Lantz, </em>607 F.2d 290, 295 (9th Cir.1979); <em>see Suburban Transit Corp. v. NLRB, </em>499 F.2d 78, 80 n. 1 (3d Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>419 U.S. 1089, 95 S.Ct. 681, 42 L.Ed.2d 682 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b635-10\">In a detailed discussion of the facts, the ALJ reviewed the ample evidence of the integration of the two entities. Harrisburg Drywall shared ABI\u2019s office building, equipment and personnel. \u201c[T]he only assets of a corporeal nature retained by Harrisburg Drywall were a single, 1974 vintage van, and some office equipment inherited from Premici\u2019s firm.... Harrisburg Drywall had no warehouse, engineering, sales or clerical force, but individuals employed by ABI served the former\u2019s needs in these areas. All utility costs, including gasoline, electricity, telephones, incurred by Harrisburg Drywall and ABI were paid by ABI.\u201d There were no written agreements evidencing the \u201chousing\u201d arrangement or ABI\u2019s provision of equipment, administrative support and expenditures for overhead costs. Payment for rent and other overhead expenses, including headquarters\u2019 staff salaries, was made annually according to the gross volume of Harrisburg Drywall\u2019s business relative to ABI\u2019s, which the ALJ found was hardly indicative of \u201carm\u2019s length\u201d dealing. The AU characterized Harrisburg Drywall \u201cas a operational shell with no independent administrative capacity and little in the way of capital assets.\u201d He further stated, \u201cthis was complemented by integration of ABI resources upon the operations of Harrisburg Drywall at every level, from management to craftsmen who performed on the job site.\u201d Bryant performed many managerial functions for Harrisburg Drywall. Jean Hoffman signed checks and purchased supplies for Harrisburg Drywall. Larry McClain, ABI\u2019s coordinator, also served as Harrisburg Drywall\u2019s coordinator. Harrisburg Drywall\u2019s president, Charles May, was usually absent from the office, spending most of his time in the field super<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>vising employees and performing carpentry tasks.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-4\">There is substantial evidence to support the ALJ\u2019s critical finding, affirmed by the Board, that the two companies shared centralized labor relations control. He found, for example, that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AxxW\">the integration of the two entities is further evidenced by the frequent and seemingly at random interchange of craftsmen as between Harrisburg Drywall and ABI. In several instances, carpenters would work for both firms during the same work week. This occurred in excess of 50 times in 1979, on 30 occasions in 1978, and in excess of 80 in 1977. On at least two occasions, the same employee worked for both firms in a single day. Carpenter Gulliver testified that the only way he could tell which firm he was working for was the designation on the payroll check. The lack of separate identity of the respective work forces of Harrisburg Drywall and ABI is indicated by the fact that in 1977, 10 of the 14 employees on the payroll of Harrisburg Drywall had also worked for ABI, in 1978, 8 Harrisburg Drywall employees had worked for ABI, while in 1979, 6 Harrisburg Drywall employees had also appeared on the payroll of ABI.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b636-5\">(footnotes omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b636-6\">Respondents do not appear to seriously question the factual underpinnings which led the ALJ and the Board to conclude that ABI and Harrisburg Drywall were a single employer. Instead they argue that there is no evidence in the record to indicate that any work which was traditionally \u201cunion\u201d work was transferred to the nonunion side of the double breasted operation, and they suggest that we should impose such a requirement before 8(a)(5) and (1) liability is imposed in double breasted cases. The Board authority upon which respondents rely, <em>United Constructors &amp; Goodwin Construction Co., </em>233 N.L.R.B. 904 (1977), does not support the proposition. In the <em>United Constructors </em>case there were several factors which led the Board not to find a single employer in the double breasted context, including lack of participation of the first firm\u2019s owners\u2019in the day-to-day operation of second firm, lack of simultaneous supervision by the same personnel and use of written leases utilizing standard rates. As the foregoing discussion indicates, the ABI-Harrisburg Drywall situation presents far different facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-8\">We see no reason to adopt respondents\u2019 suggestion that \u201csubterfuge\u201d is necessary before finding that two employers are bound to each other\u2019s contracts. A contractor engaged in a double breasted operation has the best of both worlds, since it can bid through its union company when jobs require union contractors but can underbid a unionized company through its second operation on jobs that do not require union contractors. <em>See </em>Dayton Comment at 45-46. There is evidence in this case that that is precisely how Bryant used the ABI and Harrisburg Drywall companies. During the course of a meeting with union representatives Bryant stated he owned both a \u201cunion\u201d and \u201copen shop\u201d company and that he would use the open shop company as \u201can alternative\u201d if the unions \u201cwere going to force him to do so.\u201d Where the same employees can be and are, as in this case, switched back and forth between a union and nonunion payroll, the benefits which the employees reap from the union\u2019s collective bargaining can be diluted or dissipated. Furthermore, such an arrangement can generate confusion and disputes since the employee may be paid different wages, as occurred here, depending on which entity kept him on the payroll a particular day. The Board should be free to apply its expertise in the field of labor relations to hold that when the factual prerequisites of finding a single employer and appropriate unit are present, sections 8(a)(5) and (1) apply even without proof that union work was transferred to the nonunion side. No such requirement was suggested when the Supreme Court was presented with the single employer issue, <em>see South Prairie Construction Co. v. Local No. 627, supra, </em>and we decline to impose one.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>B. <em>The Board\u2019s Unit Determination</em></p>\n<p id=\"b637-5\">The Board recognizes sections 8(a)(5) and (1) of the Act apply to entities functioning as a single employer only if there is a finding that their aggregate employees constitute an appropriate bargaining unit. <em>See South Prairie Construction Co. v. Local No. 627, </em>425 U.S. at 803-05, 96 S.Ct. at 1843-44; <em>see also NLRB v. Lantz, </em>607 F.2d at 297. In this case the ALJ found that a unit consisting of the \u201ccarpenters employed by ABI and Harrisburg Drywall\u201d was appropriate after considering \u201cthe functional integration of the operations, the similarity of the work performed and common skills of the employees, the extent of centralized management and supervision, the high incidence of temporary interchange, as well as centralized control of labor relations including the hiring and assignment of employees between jobs and firms.\u201d In affirming the ALJ\u2019s conclusion the Board also referred to the identical nature of the services provided.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-6\">The Board\u2019s determination of the scope of a bargaining unit will not be overturned by the court absent a finding \u201cthat the Board has acted in a manner that is \u2018unreasonable and arbitrary.\u2019 \u201d <em>NLRB v. Saint Francis College, </em>562 F.2d 246, 249 (3d Cir.1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b637-7\">Respondents argue that this unit determination was inappropriate because the Board allegedly failed to follow its decision in <em>A-l Fire Protection, Inc., </em>250 N.L.R.B. 217 (1980), <em>remanded sub nom. Road Sprinkler Fitters Local Union No. 669 v. NLRB, </em>676 F.2d 826 (D.C.Cir.1982). In the <em>A-l </em>case, however, the Board had viewed the union\u2019s action in voluntarily acquiescing to the exclusion of one group of a single employer\u2019s employees from a collective bargaining agreement as a voluntary agreement on unit scope. Respondents here argue that because an agreement was negotiated with Keystone subsequent to Bryant\u2019s absorption of Harrisburg Drywall, the <em>A-l </em>case is applicable. The Board, however, distinguished the <em>A-l </em>situation on the ground that Bryant, rather than frankly advising the union of his operation of Harrisburg Drywall at the time of the contract negotiations, instead concealed his operation and asserted that he had \u201cnothing to do\u201d with Harrisburg Drywall\u2019s operation and that he did not \u201crun it.\u201d In light of this fact, the Board was not bound to find that the union \u201cvoluntarily acquiesced\u201d in a unit determination which excluded the employees of the nonunion company.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-12\">Given our narrow scope of review over a unit determination and the substantial evidence on the record to support the Board\u2019s finding of an appropriate unit, we find no basis to overturn its conclusion that ABI and Harrisburg Drywall violated sections 8(a)(5) and (1) by failing to recognize the charging unions and failing to apply the negotiated agreements to the combined employees.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b637-13\">C. <em>Associates as an Alter Ego</em></p>\n<p id=\"b637-14\">Respondents argue that the Board\u2019s finding that Associates was the alter ego of ABI and Harrisburg Drywall is not supported by substantial evidence. \u201c[T]he focus of the alter ego doctrine, unlike that of the single employer doctrine, is on the existence of a disguised continuance or an attempt to avoid the obligations of a collective bargaining agreement through a sham transaction or a technical change in operations.\u201d <em>Carpenters Local Union No. 1846 </em>v. <em>Pratt-Farnsworth, Inc., </em>690 F.2d at 508; <em>see also </em>Comment, <em>Dual Companies </em>\u2014 When <em>Does a Union Have the Right to Expanded Representation?, </em>12 U.S.F.L.Rev. 89, 93 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b637-15\">Like the single employer finding, the finding that one company is the alter ego of another is a question of fact. <em>See South-port Petroleum Co. v. NLRB, </em>315 U.S. 100, 106, 62 S.Ct. 452, 455, 86 L.Ed. 718 (1942). The factors to which the Board looks are the substantial identity of management, business purpose, operation, equipment, customers, supervision and ownership between <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>the old and new corporations. <em>See Carpenters Local Union No. 1846, </em>690 F.2d at 507. There is substantial evidence to support the finding that Associates is the alter ego in disguised continuance of ABI and Harrisburg Drywall. Associates was created to perform the same kind of work as ABI and Harrisburg Drywall. It occupied the same building, and shared some areas of its office and warehouse. It assumed the utility bills previously paid by ABI, rented ABI\u2019s office furniture, equipment and scaffolding, and employed substantially unchanged ABI staff. Five of the six nonmanagerial headquarters employees who had worked for ABI were transferred to Associates\u2019 payroll in the first week of its operation and the sixth was transferred shortly thereafter. Associates took its initial field staff from the other companies. ABI\u2019s three managers were transferred to Associates\u2019 payroll and continued to perform similar managerial functions in that capacity. Furthermore, it is significant, if not crucial, that Associates was created after the filing of unfair labor practice charges against ABI and Harrisburg Drywall, and substantial evidence supports the ALJ\u2019s finding that it was a \u201cdisguised continuance ... through which contractual obligations to Keystone and Western and putative statutory remedies were to be avoided.\u201d As the ALJ found, Associates</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b638-4\">was formed with knowledge of the labor difficulties and unfair labor practice charges confronting ABI and Harrisburg Drywall, and continued with an identical business purpose and objective. Administrative, managerial, sales, engineering, warehousing and clerical employees were simply removed from the payroll of one firm one day and appeared on the payroll of the other the next. For the first 5 months of its existence, [Associates] drew exclusively from the Harrisburg Drywall blue collar work force. Like Harrisburg Drywall, it utilized the equipment of ABI and shared administrative and clerical support with that firm.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b638-5\">Respondents dispute the characterization of Associates as the alter ego of the other two companies principally by objecting to the ALJ\u2019s finding that Bryant \u201ccontinued to function as the principal source of [Associates\u2019] policy and executive authority.\u201d This finding was based in part on the ALJ\u2019s credibility determination. In addition, there was evidence that Bryant spent up to five days a week in the joint ABI/Associates offices, that ABI\u2019s activities were practically at a standstill, that Bryant was frequently \u201cconsulted\u201d about Associates\u2019 business, that Bryant\u2019s salary under a \u201cconsulting agreement\u201d with Associates was twice that of its president, and that he exercised some supervision over sales personnel. This evidence supports the finding that Bryant retained sufficient control over the affairs of Associates to meet the alter ego criteria applied by this court in <em>NLRB v. Scott Printing Corp., supra. </em>As we indicated earlier, it is unnecessary to embark on a unit determination analysis once there is adequate evidence to support the finding that Associates was the alter ego of the other two companies.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-7\">Since we find that there was substantial evidence to support the Board\u2019s findings that ABI and Harrisburg Drywall were a single employer, that their carpenter employees constituted an appropriate bargaining unit, and that Associates was the alter ego of the other two companies, it follows that the Board\u2019s finding that respondents violated sections 8(a)(5) and (1) of the Act was proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-8\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-9\">THE ALJ\u2019S CONDUCT</p>\n<p id=\"b638-10\">The respondents\u2019 claim that the ALJ\u2019s conduct deprived them of a fair hearing. They complain that he evidenced hostility to Bryant and his attorney, that he seemingly had prejudged issues before all the evidence was in, and that he took on the qualities of an advocate in his examination of witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-11\">The Board considered this claim and concluded that, \u201c[w]hile we believe some of the statements made by the Administrative Law Judge at the hearing may have been ill-chosen, upon our full review of the rec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>ord and the Decision of the Administrative Law Judge, we perceive no evidence that he prejudged the case, made prejudicial rulings, or demonstrated bias, hostility, and prejudice toward Respondents\u2019 counsel.\u201d The Board found no evidence of partiality in the ALJ\u2019s examination of respondents\u2019 witnesses or in his analysis and discussion of the evidence. The conduct of the ALJ did not in all instances project the image of a patient, impartial adjudicator. Nevertheless, the record does not establish that the respondents failed to receive a fair hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-5\">VI.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-6\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b639-7\">For the foregoing reasons, we will grant the Board\u2019s application for enforcement of its order.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b631-7\">. The ALJ also construed a statement by Bryant to a union representative in May 1979 as conveying the possibility that there would be further consideration given to the union\u2019s demand. In light of our acceptance of the ALJ\u2019s principal grounds for finding the Western charge timely, we need not reach this additional reason.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b632-5\">. The Board\u2019s position, which was accepted by the Ninth Circuit in <em>Strong, </em>is that a subsequent refusal to sign a labor contract within the section 10(b) period constitutes a continued refusal to bargain violation even if the initial refusal is outside the period. <em>See </em>Torrington Construction Co., 235 N.L.R.B. 1540, 1540 n. 2, 1545 (1978).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b633-9\">. In adopting this approach, we need not rely on any continuing violation theory. <em>See J. Ray McDermott &amp; Co. v. NLRB, </em>571 F.2d at 858.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b633-15\">. As the Board recognized, the remedy is to be limited to six months before filing of the charge and, as it ordered in the case of Keystone, can in no event precede the date of the demand within that period.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b637-8\">. Since we find there was substantial evidence to support the Board\u2019s conclusions that ABI and Harrisburg Drywall were a single employer and that the bargaining unit was appropriate, we need not reach its finding that Harrisburg Drywall was ABI\u2019s alter ego.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
