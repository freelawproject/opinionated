Each underlying action asserts a claim for damages against J-M and others for an injury allegedly sustained from exposure to asbestos fibers contained in products manufactured or sold by the defendants. Each action was pending in this Court on August 26,1982 on which date J-M filed a voluntary petition for reorganization under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code, 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101 <em>et seq., </em>in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Northern District of New York. Presently before the Court is J-M\u2019s motion in each action to stay further appellate proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-9\">Section 362(a) automatically stays all proceedings against the debtor:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b145-10\">\u00a7 362. Automatic stay</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AzN\">(a) Except as provided in subsection (b) of this section, a petition filed under section 301, 302, or 303 of this title operates as a stay, applicable to all entities, of\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"An0\">(1) the commencement or continuation, including the issuance or employment of process, of a judicial, administrative, or other proceeding against the debtor that was or could have been commenced before the commencement of the case under this title, or to recover a claim against the debtor that arose before the commencement of the case under this title.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b145-14\">11 U.S.C. \u00a7 362(a). Accordingly, the filing of J-M\u2019s petition for reorganization served to automatically stay the \u201ccontinuation\u201d of all \u201cjudicial\u201d \u201cproceeding[s]\u201d \u201cagainst the debtor\u201d. It is beyond peradventure that the instant appeals are continuations of judicial proceedings. Indeed, the bankruptcy court presiding over J-M\u2019s petition has acknowledged that the automatic stay of proceeding is applicable at both the trial and appellate levels. <em>See: In re Johns-Manville Corporation, et al, </em>26 B.R. 405, <em>adversary-proceeding </em>No. 82-6221A, Decision No. 1, and <em>adversary proceeding </em>26 B.R. 420 (Bkrtcy.S.D.N.Y.1983). Similarly, the bankruptcy court presiding over a petition for reorganization filed by Unarco Industries, Inc. (Unarco), a defendant in thousands of asbestos actions pending nationwide, has proclaimed that the stay of proceedings against Unarco operates at the appellate level. <em>See: In re UNR Industries, Inc., </em>23 B.R. 144 (Bkrtcy.N.D.Ill.1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b145-15\">Since the instant appeals are continuations of judicial proceedings, the only pertinent inquiry is whether such proceedings are \u201cagainst the debtor.\u201d 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 362(a). In at least one of the present consolidated appeals, <em>Bunch, et al. v. JohnsManville Sales Corporation, et al., </em>the district court awarded damages against J-M who subsequently perfected an appeal.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The <em>Bunch </em>plaintiffs contend that J-M\u2019s voluntary perfection of the instant appeal can only adhere to the benefit of J-M\u2019s estate and that, accordingly, said proceeding is not \u201cagainst the debtor\u201d. Confronting the construction of the term \u201cagainst the debtor\u201d within the meaning of 11 U.S.C. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>\u00a7 362(a), this Court concludes that satisfaction of that criteria must be ascertained from an examination of the debtor\u2019s status at the <em>initial </em>proceeding. The Third Circuit has cogently provided the following unassailable rationale:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b146-4\">In our view, section 362 should be read to stay all appeals in proceedings that were <em>originally brought </em>against the debt- or, regardless of whether the debtor is the appellant or appellee. Thus, whether a case is subject to the automatic stay must be determined at its inception. That determination should not change depending on the particular stage of the litigation at which the filing of the petition in bankruptcy occurs.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b146-5\">* * * * * <em>*</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b146-6\"><em>2. </em>Difficulties with the \u201cappellant-ap-pellee\u201d approach to section 362 would arise even if only one party appealed. We can hypothesize an appeal by a debtor from an adverse judgment rendered in an action brought against it by one of its creditors. If the appeal is permitted because it is an appeal \u201cby\u201d the debtor, and the debtor prevails on the appeal, we question the effect of such an interpretation if the creditor decides to bring the case to a higher court. Is this second level of appeal then stayed because the appeal is not one \u201cagainst\u201d the debtor? The unfairness of such an approach is obvious.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Axl\"><em>Association of St. Croix Condominium Owners v. St. Croix Hotel, </em>682 F.2d 446, 449 (3d Cir.1982). It would be anomalous for this Court to adjudge that the instant appeal is not \u201cagainst the debtor\u201d and therefore not subject to the automatic stay when it is undisputed that, should the merits of the appeal be reached and the action remanded for a new trial, the stay of proceeding would then attach since J-M would have been returned to its initial status of defendant. It is inconceivable that Congress intended or envisioned construction of the phrase \u201cagainst the debtor\u201d to oscillate in any given judicial proceeding depending upon which stage of trial the action had progressed on the date of the filing of the bankruptcy petition. In the actions at bar J-M\u2019s initial status as defendant satisfies the \u201cagainst the debtor\u201d criteria of \u00a7 362(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b146-8\">All criteria of \u00a7 362(a)(1) have been satisfied. The automatic stay of proceedings imposed by \u00a7 362(a) is inapplicable only when one of the eight criteria enumerated in \u00a7 362(b) is demonstrated. It has not been contended in these appeals, nor does it appear, that any category of \u00a7 362(b) applies. Therefore the automatic and mandatory stay of \u00a7 362(a) attaches to the instant appellate proceedings. <em>Accord: Austin v. Unarco Industries, Inc., </em>No. 82-116B (1st Cir. Aug. 5, 1982) (order). <em>Contra: Hendrix v. Raybestos-Manhattan, Inc., </em>No. 82-8538 (11th Cir. Dec. 22, 1982) (order), <em>reh. denied, </em>Jan. 28, 1982; <em>Jackson v. Johns-Manville Sales Corporation, </em>No. 82-4288 (5th Cir. Feb. 7,1983) (order); <em>Shop in the Grove, Ltd. v. Union Fed. Savings &amp; Loan Association, </em>425 So.2d 1138 (Fla.App. 1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b146-9\">A party in interest may seek relief from the automatic stay of \u00a7 362(a):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b146-10\">(d) On request of a party in interest and after notice and a hearing, the court shall grant relief from the stay provided under subsection (a) of this section, such as by terminating, annulling, modifying, or conditioning such stay\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b146-11\">(1) for cause, including the lack of adequate protection of an interest in property of such party in interest; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b146-12\">(2) with respect to a stay of an act against property, if\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b146-13\">(A) the debtor does not have an equity in such property; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b146-14\">(B) such property is not necessary to an effective reorganization.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b146-15\">11 U.S.C. \u00a7 362(d). The legislative history of \u00a7 362(d) unambiguously identifies the <em>bankruptcy </em>court as the exclusive authority to grant relief from the stay:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b146-16\">Section 362(d) of the House amendment represents a compromise between comparable provisions in the House bill and Senate amendment. Under section 362(d)(1) of the House amendment, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>court may terminate, annul, modify, or condition the automatic stay for cause, including lack of adequate protection of an interest in property of a secured party. It is anticipated that the Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure will provide that those hearings will receive priority on the calendar. Under section 362(d)(2) the court may alternatively terminate, annul, modify, or condition the automatic stay for the cause including inadequate protection for the creditor. The court shall grant relief from the stay if there is no equity and it is not necessary to an effective reorganization of the debtor.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b147-5\">House Report No. 95-595, U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News 1978, p. 5787, Notes of Committee on the Judiciary. <em>Accord: In re Holtkamp, </em>669 F.2d 505, 507 (7th Cir.1982) (\u00a7 362(d) \u201ccommits the decision of whether to lift the stay to the discretion of the bankruptcy judge\u201d); <em>In re Belated Asbestos Cases, </em>23 B.R. 523, 526 (N.D.Cal.1982) (\u201cthe original bankruptcy courts alone should have exclusive power to lift an actual stay under section \u00a7 362\u201d); <em>Elliott v. Hardison, </em>25 B.R. 305, 308 (E.D.Va.1982); <em>In re Frigitemp Corp., </em>8 B.R. 284 (S.D.N.Y.1981); 1A <em>Collier on Bankruptcy, </em>\u00b6 11.06 at 1164 (4th ed.). Because this Court possesses no authority to grant relief from the automatic stay of proceedings, the equitable considerations advanced on appeal by J-M\u2019s adversaries, while compelling, are directed to the improper forum.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Relief from the stay may only be achieved in accordance with the statutory mechanism established by Congress. Other asbestos plaintiffs have recognized the exclusive authority of the bankruptcy court presiding over J-M\u2019s petition to annul the stay of proceedings and have successfully petitioned for that precise relief. <em>See: Beatrice Hansen v. Johns-Manville Sales Corp., </em>No. 82-6450A (Bkrtcy.S.D. N.Y.1982); <em>Johns-Manville Sales Corp. v. Edward Janssens, et al., </em>(Bkrtcy.S.D.N.Y. 1982). This Court must comport to the congressional mandate and honor the automatic stay until such time as the instant proceedings may proceed in a manner consistent with the statutory framework.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b147-8\">Accordingly, further proceedings in the instant actions are hereby STAYED until such time as they may be ordered to continue in a manner consistent with the Code.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b145-11\">. In <em>Robert and Edna Bunch v. Johns-Manville Sales Corporation, </em>No. 82-5433, a jury trial resulted in the following awards: (1) $280,000 compensatory damages for Robert Bunch; (2) $140,000 compensatory damages for Edna Bunch; (3) $220,000 punitive damages for Robert Bunch. Entertaining J-M\u2019s motion for a new trial or judgment notwithstanding the ver-diet, the district court sustained the award of compensatory and punitive damages to Robert Bunch, but granted a new trial on Edna Bunch\u2019s consortium claim conditioned on her refusal to accept a remittitur of $90,000. From this judgment J-M appealed. Plaintiffs Robert and Edna Bunch filed, and then dismissed, a notice of cross-appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b147-6\">. It is submitted, <em>inter alia, </em>that plaintiffs may die without receiving compensation long overdue, that J-M will be unfairly benefited by receiving additional time in which to tender compensation, and that, in <em>Bunch, </em>J-M\u2019s estate can only be appreciated by a continuation of appellate proceedings and that, therefore, there is no justification for delay.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b147-19\">. For example, the automatic stay of \u00a7 362(a) may expire by its own terms under 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 362(c) (case is closed, dismissed, or discharge is granted), or relief from the stay may be granted by the bankruptcy court under 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 362(d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
