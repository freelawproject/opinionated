Nicholson, challenges an order of the Interstate Commerce Commission (Commission) which dismissed his complaint alleging that the Missouri Pacific Railroad Co. (Missouri Pacific) had violated the Interstate Commerce Act, 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 10901(a) (Supp. V 1981),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> by attempting to build a railroad line \u2014 to wit, a classification yard adjacent to its main-line track in Pointe Coupee Parish, Louisiana \u2014 on his land without a finding by the Commission of public convenience and necessity. The Commission ruled that the classification yard was not a \u201crailroad line\u201d requiring the approval called for by section 10901(a), but rather was a switching track excepted from Commission jurisdiction by 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 10907(b)(1) (Supp. V 1981).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>Nicholson v. Missouri Pacific R.R., </em>366 I.C.C. 69, 72-74 (1982). Because well-established judicial and Commission precedent compel the conclusion that the proposed Missouri Pacific classification yard is not a \u201crailroad line\u201d requiring Commission approval, we affirm the Commission\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-25\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-26\">Petitioner owns farmland in Pointe Cou-pee Parish, Louisiana, on which he grows <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>soybeans and other crops. Missouri Pacific presently owns a right-of-way over petitioner\u2019s land for the operation of a single-line track of railroad, but wishes to construct a classification yard adjacent to its track on petitioner\u2019s land. The numerous tracks in the yard will be used to switch cars in the making up and breaking up of freight trains, to arrange cars of trains in delivery order, and to sort cars in trains by types of cars or contents preparatory to train movement.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> As a public utility, Missouri Pacific has filed an action under state law in Louisiana state court to acquire by condemnation the necessary portion of petitioner\u2019s land. <em>Missouri Pacific R.R. v. Nicholson, </em>Civil Action No. 17299 (La.Dist.Ct.1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b450-4\">Petitioner<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> filed a complaint with the Commission seeking a cease and desist order to prevent Missouri Pacific from taking any steps to construct the classification yard without Commission approval pursuant to section 10901(a).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Petitioner contended that the classification yard would be \u201can additional railroad line\u201d requiring the Commission\u2019s prior approval and that the Commission had not made the findings required by the statute. 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 10901(a) (Supp. Y 1981). A Commission Review Board dismissed the complaint because it was not ripe for review. The Review Board reasoned that a \u201ccivil decision against [Missouri Pacific] may totally moot the issue of whether Commission approval of [Missouri Pacific\u2019s] construction is required.\u201d <em>Nicholson v. Missouri Pacific R.R., </em>Finance Docket No. 29657, slip op. at 2 (Sept. 15,1981). On appeal, the Commission affirmed the dismissal of petitioner\u2019s complaint, although on different grounds. <em>Nicholson v. Missouri Pacific R.R., supra, </em>366 I.C.C. at 69.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-11\">The Commission found that the complaint was ripe for review because petitioner had demonstrated \u201ca substantial probability that if the Commission waits, [petitioner] would be harmed by the challenged conduct before the Commission could determine its legality.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 72. However, the Commission also found that the operations which would be performed at the classification yard would be <em>incidental </em>to main-line transportation and that such transportation would continue over Missouri Pacific\u2019s existing track. Noting that it had consistently held yards exempt from its jurisdiction under section 10907(b),<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and had never authorized the construction of a classification yard, the Commission ruled that the proposed classification yard was not a railroad line requiring approval pursuant to section 10901(a). <em>Id. </em>at 72-74. This petition for review followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-12\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-13\">Petitioner contends that the Commission erred in concluding that construction of the proposed classification yard did not require its approval.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Petitioner argues that because section 10102(19) of the Interstate Commerce Act defines <em>\u201crailroad\u201d </em>to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>include \u201cyard,\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> the Act\u2019s requirement that Commission authorization be received prior to construction of <em>\u201crailroad </em>lines\u201d necessarily encompasses construction of \u201cyards.\u201d Petitioner also argues that because the proposed classification yard will cost $75 million, the substantiality of the cost requires the Commission to rule upon the project prior to its construction. We find these arguments to be without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-5\">It is well established that the determination of whether a particular track segment is a \u201crailroad line,\u201d requiring Commission authorization pursuant to section 10901(a), or a \u201cspur, industrial, team, switching, or side\u201d track, exempt from Commission jurisdiction pursuant to section 10907(b),<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> turns on the intended use of the track segment, not on the label or cost of the segment. It was held early on that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AAS\">it is sufficiently plain, from a consideration of not only the obvious purpose prompting the [Interstate Commerce Act<footnotemark>10</footnotemark>] but also of the general nature of the tracks mentioned, that Congress intended <em>to subject to the requirements of [section 1(18)] </em>so-called main or branch lines of railroad, that is, <em>lines designed and used for continuous transportation service by through, full .trains between different points of shipment or travel, and to exclude </em>from the operation of the statute <em>all that mass of \u201ctracks\u201d </em>(as distinguished from \u201clines\u201d) naturally and necessarily <em>designed and used for </em>loading, unloading, <em>switching, </em>and other <em>purposes </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number><em>connected with, and incidental to, </em>but not actually and directly used for, <em>such transportation service.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b452-4\"><em>Detroit &amp; M. Ry. v. Boyne City, G. &amp; A.R.R., </em>286 F. 540, 546 (E.D.Mich.1923) (emphasis added).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Shortly thereafter, the Supreme Court held that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"aze-dedup-0\"><em>[i]f the purpose and effect of the new trackage is to extend substantially the line of a carrier into new territory, the proposed trackage constitutes an extension of the railroad </em>within the meaning of [section 1(18) of the Act], although the line be short and although the character of the service contemplated be that commonly rendered ... by means of spurs or industrial tracks.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b452-5\"><em>Texas &amp; P. Ry. v. Gulf, Colo. &amp; S.F. Ry., </em>270 U.S. 266, 278, 46 S.Ct. 263, 266, 70 L.Ed. 578 (1926) (emphasis added). Thus it can be seen that track segments which are intended to be used to carry through trains between points of shipment and delivery, particularly those segments which extend a railroad\u2019s service into new territory, must be approved by the Commission pursuant to section 10901(a). On the other hand, track segments which are merely incidental to, and not required for, a railroad\u2019s service between points of shipment and delivery are exempted from the requirements of section 10901(a) by section 10907(b).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b452-6\">Application of these principles to Missouri Pacific\u2019s proposed classification yard compels the conclusion that construction of the Pointe Coupee Classification Yard is not the construction of a \u201crailroad line\u201d requiring Commission approval pursuant to section 10901(a). The yard will be located adjacent to Missouri Pacific\u2019s existing main-line track in Pointe Coupee Parish and will be used solely for storage, <em>switching, </em>and classification of railroad cars. Although the classification yard is expected to increase Missouri Pacific\u2019s efficiency in handling freight traffic, the yard will not extend Missouri Pacific\u2019s service into any new territory. Through trains will continue to move over Missouri Pacific\u2019s existing mainline track to their prior destinations; the classification yard will be <em>incidental </em>to the operation of trains over that track. Accordingly, construction of the classification yard is exempted from Commission jurisdiction by section 10907(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b452-11\">Support for this conclusion is found in a decision of the Fifth Circuit which held, without explanation, that Commission approval pursuant to section 1(18) of the Interstate Commerce Act<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> was not required prior to the construction of a classification yard. <em>Georgia S. &amp; Fla. Ry. v. Duval Connecting R.R., </em>324 F.2d 801, 802 (5th Cir. 1963) (per curiam). Furthermore, the Commission has consistently interpreted the Act as not requiring its approval prior to the construction of yards: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number><em>Oregon-Washington R.R. &amp; Navigation Co. Construction, </em>275 I.C.C. 591, 598 (1950) (emphasis added). <em>Accord Terminal Ry. Ala. State Docks </em>\u2014 Operation, <em>Mobile, Ala., </em>354 I.C.C. 747, 749 (1978); <em>Boston Terminal Co. Reorganization, </em>312 I.C.C. 373, 378 (1960).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b452-12\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>The applicant correctly states that the construction of a <em>new yard </em>and the consolidation of terminal facilities <em>are not within themselves subject to the jurisdiction of this Commission </em>and may be accomplished without its authority.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b453-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>Petitioner\u2019s arguments do not require a contrary result. The fact that the Interstate Commerce Act defines \u201crailroad\u201d to include \u201cyard\u201d does not support an interpretation that the phrase \u201crailroad line\u201d includes switching yards. There is a distinction in the statute between \u201crailroad\u201d and \u201crailroad line.\u201d <em>See Long Island R.R. v. New York C.R.R., </em>281 F.2d 379, 382-83 (2d Cir.1960).<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Petitioner\u2019s reasoning simply ignores the significance of the term \u201cline\u201d in the phrase \u201crailroad line,\u201d as well as sixty years of judicial and Commission interpretation of that phrase. Furthermore, nothing in the Act requires Commission authorization of railroad construction projects solely because such projects are costly.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> It is the purpose, and not the cost, of such projects which determines whether Commission approval is required.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-5\">Petitioner contends that his position is supported by several Supreme Court decisions, but we find this reliance to be misplaced. The opinion by Chief Justice Taft in <em>Railroad Commission v. Southern Pacific Co., </em>264 U.S. 331, 44 S.Ct. 376, 68 L.Ed. 713 (1924), comes the closest to discussing the point at issue, but it is distinguishable on its facts. In <em>Southern Pacific </em>the Court held that the Commission was required to give its approval before the City of Los Angeles could require three national railroads to replace their existing passenger stations with a single union station. <em>Id. </em>at 347, 44 S.Ct. at 379. The plan for the new union station required the three railroads to make substantial <em>extensions </em>to their main-line tracks, which, while not great in distance, would \u201cinvolve a new intramural destination for each railway with important changes in the handling of interstate traffic and passengers\u201d and great expense to change the routes of \u201cthe <em>main tracks </em>in a crowded city.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 346, 44 S.Ct. at 379 (emphasis added). These substantial changes necessarily involved the abandonment by the three railroads of the main-line tracks that previously served their old depots and the <em>extension </em>of their main lines to the new terminal as ordered by the California State Railroad Commission at the request of the City of Los Angeles.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-10\">The project considered by the Court in <em>Southern Pacific </em>is clearly distinguishable from the Pointe Coupee Classification Yard because, as the Commission found, \u201cthe proposed [classification] yard is <em>not a line of railroad or an extension of a line </em>within the meaning of section 10901, since the operations to be performed at the yard are incidental to line-haul transportation.\u201d <em>Nicholson v. Missouri Pacific R.R., supra, </em>366 I.C.C. at 74 (emphasis added) (footnote omitted). This factual description of the classification yard leaves the Commission without jurisdiction over the proposed construction. <em>See </em>49 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 10901(a), 10907(b)(1) (Supp. V 1981). The absence of any change in, or <em>extension </em>of Missouri Pacific\u2019s mainline track, distinguishes its classification yard project from the union station project and associated new main lines that required Commission approval in <em>Southern Pacific.</em><footnotemark><em>16</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b453-11\">\n<em>III.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b453-12\">Missouri Pacific\u2019s proposed classification yard will be <em>incidental </em>to the operation of its existing main-line track that runs <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>through Pointe Coupee Parish, Louisiana. It does not involve any change in or extension of its mainline track and it qualifies as \u201cswitching\u201d tracks that are specifically excluded by section 10907(b)(1) from the authority of the Commission under section 10901(a). Accordingly, the provisions of section 10901(a) do not require that Missouri Pacific obtain Commission authorization in order to construct said yard. The decision of the Commission so holding and dismissing petitioner\u2019s complaint against Missouri Pacific is therefore affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-4\">\n<em>Judgment accordingly.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b449-12\">. 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 10901(a) (Supp. V 1981) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b449-13\">A rail carrier providing transportation subject to the jurisdiction of the Interstate Commerce Commission ... may\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b449-14\">(1) construct an extension to any of its railroad lines;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b449-15\">(2) construct an additional railroad line;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b449-16\">(3) acquire or operate an extended or additional railroad line; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b449-17\">(4) provide transportation over, or by means of, an extended or additional railroad line;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b449-18\">only if the Commission finds that the present or future public convenience and necessity require or permit the construction or acquisition (or both) and operation of the railroad line.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b449-28\">. 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 10907(b) (Supp. V 1981) (emphasis added) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b449-29\">The Commission does <em>not </em>have authority under sections 10901-10906 of this title over\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b449-30\">(1) the construction, acquisition, operation, abandonment, or discontinuance of spur, industrial, team, <em>switching, </em>or side tracks if the tracks are located, or intended to be located, entirely in one State....</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b450-5\">.

Petitioner also raises several frivolous procedural arguments in his petition for review. Petitioner asserts that the Commission erred in denying the requests of the Louisiana Soybean Association, the American Farm Bureau Federation, and the Louisiana Farm Bureau Federation to intervene in the Commission proceeding. However, the Commission properly concluded that these organizations sought</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Alx\">intervention to present testimony <em>if the Commission holds a hearing </em>on whether destruction of agricultural land to build a classification yard is warranted. Because of our ultimate decision dismissing the complaint [for lack of jurisdiction over the proposed construction], no purpose would be served in permitting these parties to intervene.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A2A\"><em>Nicholson v. Missouri Pacific R.R., supra, </em>366 I.C.C. at 69 n. 2 (emphasis added). We find, in any event, that the clarity of the legal principles mandating our affirmance of the Commission\u2019s order obviates remand for purposes of intervention by these parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-15\">Next petitioner contends that the Commission\u2019s decision was improper because only two Commissioners of the three Commissioner Di<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>vision assigned to consider his complaint participated in that decision \u2014 one Commissioner would have participated only in the event of a tie. <em>See id. </em>at 74. The simple response to this argument is that the Interstate Commerce Act provides that the Commission may carry out its duties in Divisions consisting of three Commissioners, 49 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 10302(a), 10305 (Supp. V 1981), and that a majority of a Division is a quorum for the transaction of business. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 10306(a). Since a quorum of the assigned Division dismissed petitioner\u2019s complaint, its decision was valid. <em>Northern Valley Transfer, Inc. v. ICC, </em>192 F.Supp. 600, 603 (D.N.J.1961).</p>\n<p id=\"b451-7\">Finally, petitioner asserts that the decision was improper because the Commission was \u201cpolitically imbalanced\u201d at the time it was rendered; at that time the Commission consisted of three Republicans and one Democrat. However, petitioner concedes, as he must, that nothing in the Interstate Commerce Act requires a Division of the Commission to be politically balanced. Brief for Petitioner at 31. Thus petitioner can assert no injury as a result of the composition of the Commission since his complaint could have been assigned to a Division of the same Commissioners even if the Commission had consisted of a full contingent of eleven Commissioners, six from one party and five from the other. <em>See </em>49 U.S.C. \u00a7 10301(b) (Supp. V 1981). Petitioner\u2019s real grievance with respect to the composition of the Commission lies with the President and the Senate, who failed to appoint and confirm additional Commissioners, and not with the validly appointed Commissioners who then composed the Commission.
