Neaher, Senior District Judge for the Eastern District of New York, is sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b886-18\">NEAHER,</author>\n<p id=\"Ar-X\">Senior District Judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-19\">This appeal requires us to decide whether the common word \u201cReader\u201d can be monopolized by trademark registration for the benefit of one newspaper publisher and its licensees, to the exclusion of all others. In agreement with the district court, we answer that question in the negative and affirm its judgment in favor of the defendant-appellee.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-20\">Plaintiff-appellant, Chicago Reader, Incorporated (\u201cCRI\u201d), is the publisher of an \u201calternative\u201d newspaper in Chicago entitled \u201cReader\u201d which is distributed as \u201cChicago\u2019s Free Weekly.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> CRI commenced this action for trademark infringement and related statutory and common law claims, alleging that defendant-appellee, Metro College Publishing Company (\u201cMCP\u201d), located in Minneapolis, Minnesota, had intentionally adopted CRI\u2019s federally registered trade-name \u201cReader\u201d for the free alternative weekly newspaper MCP publishes and distributes in the Minneapolis-St. Paul area. Our jurisdiction is founded upon 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1121 and 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1338.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-21\">After a bench trial on the merits, Judge Flaum granted judgment in favor of defendant but not on its counterclaim for cancellation of CRI\u2019s trademark. In extensive findings of fact and conclusions of law the district court essentially held that the particular design form of \u201cReader\u201d as used in CRI\u2019s news-weekly was entitled to trademark protection, but not exclusive rights to the merely descriptive word \u201cReader\u201d in the context of newspapers. Thus Judge</p>\n<p id=\"b887-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"803\">*803</page-number>Flaum held that MCP\u2019s use of \u201cTwin Cities Reader\u201d in a markedly different design form did not infringe CRI\u2019s mark, confuse users of the respective publications, or constitute unfair competition or a deceptive trade practice.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-6\">CRI is an Illinois corporation having its principal place of business in Chicago. It began publication of \u201cReader\u201d on October 1, 1971, with a first run of 51,000 copies. At the time of trial a decade later, circulation had increased to 112,000 copies, all distributed in Chicago except for a few mailed subscriptions. During the same period the newspaper increased in size from an eight-page tabloid to issues of 88 or more pages.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Since readers do not pay for the paper, revenue is derived solely from local and national advertisers, solicited by CRI.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-7\">MCP\u2019s publication, originally entitled the \u201cEntertainer\u201d, began circulation in January 1976 in the metropolitan Minneapolis-St. Paul area, primarily directed to college students and selected retail categories frequented by them and other young adults. Its revenue is also substantially derived from advertisers seeking the patronage of such readers. At the time of trial, MCP\u2019s publication had a circulation of around 100,-000 copies a week including 300 to 400 mail subscribers. It is not distributed in Chicago or elsewhere.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-8\">In January 1977, MCP changed the name of its publication to \u201ctwin cities Reader.\u201d The word \u201cReader\u201d appears on the masthead in large rounded solid letters printed in color, only the initial \u201cR\u201d being capitalized, each letter overlapping the next in line, and all bordered heavily in black, conveying an image of letters standing at attention. Above \u201cReader\u201d are the words \u201ctwin cities\u201d in similar but smaller lower case letters, also in color and bordered in black. Below \u201cReader\u201d appears the phrase \u201cThe . News, Opinion <em>&amp; </em>Entertainment Weekly.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b887-10\">\u25a0 The seeds of this controversy were planted on May 24, 1978, when CRI applied for federal trademark registration of the word \u201cReader\u201d in the stylized design form used on its masthead since 1971. That design, as it appears on the Trademark Principal Register, consists solely of the word \u201cReader\u201d in non-solid, block-type black and white capital letters, the first \u201cR\u201d being reversed and the first \u201cE\u201d connected to the \u201cA\u201d, suggestive of Roman lettering. The balance of the masthead consists of two fine black lines below \u201cReader\u201d, as so described, which enclose the date and volume number and the phrase \u201cChicago\u2019s Free Weekly.\u201d In contrast to MCP\u2019s masthead, CRI\u2019s design is printed only in black ink on newsprint.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-11\">On February 20, 1979, CRI\u2019s application for registration of the mark was granted for newspaper use in Class 16. On March 12, 1979, CRI wrote MCP stating it considered MCP\u2019s use of \u201cthe trademark \u2018Reader\u2019 \u201d an infringement and unfair competition, and demanding that MCP cease and desist. When MCP did not comply, this action was commenced seeking injunctive relief in addition to treble and punitive damages. MCP responded by asserting various defenses and a counterclaim for cancellation of CRI\u2019s trademark on the ground that \u201cReader\u201d was a generic word which had become descriptive for general readership publications.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-12\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-13\">CRI\u2019s chief contention on this appeal is that the district court erred as a matter of law in holding that CRI had trademark rights only in the design form of \u201cReader\u201d and not in the word itself. That contention must be rejected in light of our many prior decisions reiterating that a term which is \u201cmerely descriptive of the ingredients, qual<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"804\">*804</page-number>ities, or characteristics of an article of trade\u201d is incapable of being the subject of a valid trademark. <em>See, e.g., Gimix, Inc. v. JS &amp; A Group, Inc., </em>699 F.2d 901 (7th Cir.1983), citing cases. As we there pointed out:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b888-4\">\u201cThe rationale for prohibiting the appropriation of such a descriptive term as a trademark rests upon the equal right of another individual producing and marketing a similar product to describe his or her product with similar accuracy. Were this right not protected by the law, elements of the language could be monopolized in such a way as to impoverish others\u2019 ability to communicate.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b888-5\">699 F.2d at 907. <em>See also M.B.H. Enterprises, Inc. v. WOKY, Inc., </em>633 F.2d 50, 55 (7th Cir.1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b888-6\">Contrary to CRTs contention, the district court was clearly correct in concluding that \u201cReader\u201d was merely a descriptive term widely associated with a variety of publications, including alternative newspapers. We find no merit in CRI\u2019s assertion that the grant of a trademark indicates that the word is suggestive rather than descriptive. As we noted in <em>Gimix, supra, </em>we may rely on the dictionary for the common understanding of words. 699 F.2d at 905. In this ease we find that the word \u201creader\u201d denotes not only those who read \u201cnewspapers and periodical literature\u201d but also the reading matter itself.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> And this is confirmed by the variety of publications to which \u201cReader\u201d in one form or another had been applied, as revealed in the list of titles included in the district court\u2019s findings of fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-7\">The district court also correctly concluded that CRI\u2019s trademark protection was limited to the particular design form of \u201cReader\u201d and did not confer a monopoly on the common word itself. That ruling is entirely consistent with our prior decisions in <em>FS Services, Inc. v. Custom Farm Services, Inc., </em>471 F.2d 671 (7th Cir.1972), and <em>Telemed Corp. v. Tel-Med, Inc., </em>588 F.2d 213 (7th Cir.1978). Thus in <em>FS Services, </em>where we recognized that a plaintiff\u2019s strong \u201cFS\u201d trademark derived its distinctiveness from a widely advertised parallelogram motif, we nonetheless also held that \u201cFS\u201d standing alone signified the descriptive terms \u201cfarm service\u201d or \u201cfarm supply\u201d and had no secondary meaning as such. It was therefore available for the defendant\u2019s use in a different logo. 471 F.2d at 673-674. Similarly apposite is our ruling in <em>Telemed, supra, </em>where we recognized the distinctiveness of a plaintiff\u2019s registered service mark as it appeared in computer \u201coptical font\u201d style. As in <em>FS Services, </em>however, we affirmed the district court\u2019s findings that apart from Telemed\u2019s optical font dress, it was but a descriptive term for medicine by telephone and thus could not bar a defendant\u2019s use of the substantially similar term \u201cTel-Med\u201d for its medical service program. 588 F.2d at 217-20.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-10\">Finally, the district court correctly concluded that CRI is entitled to continued trademark protection for its particular design of \u201cReader.\u201d As MCP has recognized, a unique design incorporating an unregistrable word may be registered as a trademark for protection against copiers. This is certainly the teaching of <em>FS Services, supra. </em>Moreover, in the field of publications it was early recognized that a plaintiff publisher\u2019s design or \u201clayout\u201d for \u201cLife\u201d magazine\u2019s cover was entitled to injunctive protection compelling another publisher to alter the color of its cover, if it continued to use the word \u201cLife\u201d as a part of its title. This relief was granted although the plaintiff\u2019s claim of trademark monopoly on the word \u201cLife\u201d was considered questionable. <em>See Time, Inc. v. Ultem Publications, Inc., </em>96 F.2d 164, 165 (2d Cir.1938). In a later case, however, the publisher of \u201cLife\u201d magazine was again granted injunctive relief protecting its cover design, even though it did not claim \u201cany exclusive property right in color or in the word \u2018Life\u2019.\u201d <em>Time, Incorporated v</em>. <em>Motor Publications, </em>227 F.2d 954, 955 (4th Cir.1955). There the defendant was permitted continued use of \u201cCar Life\u201d as a title subject to restrictions regarding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"805\">*805</page-number>size or style of type, use of a background rectangle and use of color. <em>Id. </em>at 957.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-4\">Here, the parties\u2019 versions of \u201cReader\u201d are so distinctively different in design as to obviate any need for protection of CRI\u2019s title beyond the trademark rights it already enjoys. There is no likelihood of confusion, as the district court found, since the coupling of \u201cTwin Cities\u201d with \u201cReader\u201d in MCP\u2019s title and the colors and lettering employed clearly distinguish it from CRI\u2019s title. Moreover, not only do the parties distribute their respective newspapers in widely separated markets, but the real \u201cconsumers\u201d are knowledgeable advertising personnel, and the readership appeal is to the well educated younger generation.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-5\">The judgment of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b886-15\">. \u201cAlternative\u201d newspapers are weeklies that emerged in the 1970\u2019s aimed at college students and urban dwellers in the 18 to 34 age group with spendable income. They are usually circulated to readers without charge, their revenue being derived entirely from advertisers, and feature extensive listing of events, free classified ads, and advertising emphasis on services, boutiques, restaurants and clubs as well as personal journalism and politicization of editorial comment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b887-9\">. In October 1978 CRI also began publication of a similar \u201cReader\u201d newspaper in Los Ange-les which has a current weekly circulation of 50,000 copies. In addition, it has licensed its trademark to a former employee and investor who has been publishing a \u201cReader\u201d newspaper in San Diego since October 1972, which has increased its weekly circulation since then to 100,000 copies.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b888-8\">.
