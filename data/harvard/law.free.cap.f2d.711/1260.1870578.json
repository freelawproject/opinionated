(\u201cGeorge Engine\u201d) by his employer, Toche Marine, Inc. (\u201cToche Marine\u201d) at its shipyard in Biloxi, Mississippi. An explosion and flash fire suddenly occurred, allegedly due to the ignition of flammable paint vapors. DeMelo suffered severe burns. He and his wife brought this suit in federal court in Mississippi naming George Engine, Toche Marine, and Woolsey Marine Industries, Inc. (\u201cWoolsey\u201d), the manufacturer of the paint, as defendants. The claims against George Engine and Toche Marine were based upon general maritime law and the Longshoremen\u2019s and Harbor Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 905 (1976) (the \u201cLHWCA\u201d). The DeMe-los sought recovery from Woolsey based upon breach of implied warranty and strict liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b1346-13\">Woolsey entered a special appearance and filed a motion to dismiss under Rule 12, Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, for lack of subject matter and personal jurisdiction.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The district court granted Woolsey\u2019s motion on the latter ground, finding that \u201cWoolsey has never had that minimal contact with the State of Mississippi to accord this suit the benefit of due process.\u201d In this interlocutory appeal,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1263\">*1263</page-number>DeMelos contend that for two reasons the district court erred in dismissing Woolsey. First, they argue that Woolsey has waived its personal jurisdiction defense; second, they urge that Woolsey\u2019s contacts with Mississippi render it amenable to the jurisdiction of a federal district court sitting there.</p>\n<p id=\"b1347-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1347-6\">Before the plaintiffs commenced the present lawsuit in Mississippi, Woolsey had filed a Chapter 11 bankruptcy petition in the Bankruptcy Court for the Eastern District of New York. That court entered an automatic stay under 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 362 (Supp. Ill 1979), which had the effect, among other things, of prohibiting litigation against Woolsey. Upon the filing of the present lawsuit, the plaintiffs were made aware of the automatic stay, and in January of 1981 they filed a complaint seeking relief from it. On April 20, 1981, the Bankruptcy Court approved a stipulation entered into by plaintiffs, Toche Marine and Woolsey, which provides in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1347-7\">1. Joseph De Melo, Marie De Melo, Lucy De Melo and Carlos De Melo, plaintiffs in this adversary proceeding (\u201cplaintiffs\u201d), and Toche Marine, Inc. (\u201cToche\u201d), should be and hereby are relieved, on consent of Woolsey Marine Industries, Inc. (\u201cWool-sey\u201d), as Debtor and Defendant in this proceeding, from the provisions of Section 362 of the Bankruptcy Code to the extent that they may continue the aforesaid action brought in the United States District Court for the District of Mississippi referred to hereinabove; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1347-8\">2. Plaintiffs and Toche waive any and all rights they may have to claim against Woolsey or the estate of Woolsey Marine Industries, Inc., Debtor in these bankruptcy proceedings, for satisfaction of any judgment or any other right they may have or obtain in the aforementioned action now pending in the United States District Court for the District of Mississippi, or otherwise, they agreeing to proceed solely against Aetna Insurance Company and the proceeds of the above-mentioned insurance policy to the limits of Woolsey\u2019s coverage thereunder, for any and all relief they might otherwise be entitled to against Woolsey or the bankrupt estate herein; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1347-11\">3. The relief from the stay as provided for in this stipulation is contingent upon the consent of Aetna\u2019s counsel, Thomas L. Stennis, Esq., and also upon approval of the United States Bankruptcy Court of all of the provisions hereof and it is expressly reserved that the automatic stay provided for in Section 362 of the Bankruptcy Code as respects Woolsey is modified only to the extent that the plaintiffs herein and Toche are relieved from the terms and conditions thereof and no other party to the said action now pending in Mississippi, or otherwise, shall be deemed to have been in any way or to any extent, contingent, or otherwise, relieved from the said stay, said stay remaining in full force and effect against all such parties other than the plaintiffs herein and Toche now existing or hereinafter appearing.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1347-12\">Plaintiffs argue that the provision in paragraph 1 of the stipulation lifting the automatic stay so that the parties \u201cmay continue\u201d the litigation in Mississippi constitutes a waiver by Woolsey of its personal jurisdiction defense. This argument is frivolous. Though perhaps inartfully drawn, the stipulation as a whole clearly indicates that its only purpose was to remove the barrier to the present litigation erected by the Chapter 11 petition, not to affect substantive rights in this ease. Nothing in it says that the present litigation must \u201ccontinue\u201d past a valid motion to dismiss. The right to be tried only by a court of competent jurisdiction is a liberty interest protected by the Constitution. <em>Insurance Corp. of Ireland, Ltd. v. Compagnie des Bauxites de Gui\u00f1ee, </em>456 U.S. 694, 701-02, 102 S.Ct. 2099, 2104, 72 L.Ed.2d 492, 501 (1982). It is a commonplace that waiver of constitution<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1264\">*1264</page-number>al rights in any context must \u201cat the very <em>least, </em>be clear\u201d to be effective. <em>Fuentes </em>v. <em>Shevin, </em>407 U.S. 67, 95, 92 S.Ct. 1983, 2001, 32 L.Ed.2d 556 (1972) (emphasis original); cf. <em>Petrowski </em>v. <em>Hawkeye-Security Insurance Co., </em>350 U.S. 495, 76 S.Ct. 490, 100 L.Ed. 639 (1956) (example of a stipulation clearly waiving personal jurisdiction defense). Paragraph 2 of the stipulation shows that the parties knew how to provide clearly for waiver when one was intended. Woolsey\u2019s personal jurisdiction defense has not been waived.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1348-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1348-5\">The plaintiffs\u2019 second contention is that the district court erroneously determined that Woolsey was not amenable to personal jurisdiction in federal court in Mississippi. The concept of personal jurisdiction comprises two distinct components: amenability to jurisdiction and service of process. <em>Terry v. Raymond Int\u2019l, Inc., </em>658 F.2d 398, 401 (5th Cir.1981), <em>cert. denied, </em>456 U.S. 928, 102 S.Ct. 1975, 72 L.Ed.2d 443 (1982). Amenability to jurisdiction means that a defendant is within the substantive reach of a forum\u2019s jurisdiction under applicable law. <em>Id. </em>Service of process is simply the physical means by which that jurisdiction is asserted. <em>Id. </em>Plaintiffs effected service of process on Woolsey pursuant to the Mississippi long-arm statute,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> by serving the Mississippi Secretary of State. Woolsey has not challenged the technical effectiveness of the physical service; it attacks only its amenability to the jurisdiction of the district court under applicable law.</p>\n<p id=\"b1348-12\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b1348-13\">A threshold question, not originally addressed by the parties or the district court, is whether Woolsey\u2019s amenability to personal jurisdiction in this case is governed by a federal or state standard. Unfortunately we are faced with an embarrassment of riches on this subject \u2014 our decisions are in conflict. Although both parties accepted our invitation to brief this issue supplemen-tally, neither has come to grips with it. Even so, the point is important to our law and we must address it, assisted or no.</p>\n<p id=\"b1348-14\">A little background is necessary to understand this issue fully. It is well-settled that a defendant is amenable to the personal jurisdiction of a federal court in a diversity case to the extent permitted a state court in the state where the federal court sits. <em>Brown v. Flowers Industries, Inc., </em>688 F.2d 328,331 (5th Cir.1982); <em>Terry, </em>658 F.2d at 401; <em>Gold-Kist, Inc. v. Baskin-Robbins Ice Cream Co., </em>623 F.2d 375 (5th Cir.1980) (collecting cases). In other words, a state standard applies in diversity cases: the federal court may assert personal jurisdiction only if the cognate state court could have done so. There are two components of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1265\">*1265</page-number>the state standard. First, the state\u2019s long-arm statute, as interpreted by the state courts, must apply. Second, its application in the particular case must comport with the due process requirements of the fourteenth amendment. <em>Brown, </em>688 F.2d at 331-32; <em>Terry, </em>658 F.2d at 401. Thus, the state standard, in referring to the power of state courts, incorporates elements of both state and federal law.</p>\n<p id=\"b1349-5\">The question in the present case is what standard of amenability should apply when the plaintiff\u2019s claims are founded in part upon federal question jurisdiction, but service of process is effected under a state long-arm statute. The two most recent Fifth Circuit cases on this point, decided only three days apart, give different answers. The second of these, issued on December 17 of last year, held that a federal standard applies:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1349-6\">[T]he otherwise-threshold inquiry of whether the state long-arm statute asserts jurisdiction over the defendant sought to be joined in suit, is irrelevant \u201cwhere the power of the federal court ... can be independently sustained ... on the ground that the matter in controversy arises under the Constitution, laws or treaties of the United States.\u201d <em>Lone Star Package Car Co. v. Baltimore &amp; O.R. Co., </em>212 F.2d 147, 153-54 (5th Cir.1954).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AiFH\"><em>Lapeyrouse v. Texaco, Inc., </em>693 F.2d 581, 585 (5th Cir.1982). Although the physical means of service in federal question cases may be prescribed by state law, <em>see </em>discussion of Fed.R.Civ.P. 4, <em>infra, Lapeyrouse </em>held that state limitations upon amenability to jurisdiction are inapplicable in such cases. Instead, the court held the \u201csole test of amenability\u201d in such cases is the due process clause of the fifth amendment. 693 F.2d at 585. '</p>\n<p id=\"b1349-12\">Three days before <em>Lapeyrouse </em>was decided, another panel of our court had reached the opposite result in <em>Burstein v. State Bar of California, </em>693 F.2d 511 (5th Cir.1982). That panel approached the problem by analyzing the terms of Fed.R.Civ.P. 4, the general statutory basis for assertion of personal jurisdiction in the federal courts.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>Burstein </em>held that the \u201cclear import\u201d of Rule 4, \u201cat <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1266\">*1266</page-number>least where the assertion of jurisdiction and not just the service of process depends on the state statute, is that a federal court, even <em>in a federal question case, </em>can use a state long-arm statute only to reach those parties whom a court of the state could also reach under it.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 514 (emphasis added). In so holding, the <em>Burstein </em>court distinguished a number of earlier Fifth Circuit cases, including those relied upon in <em>Lapey-rouse, </em>which undertook to announce a broad rule requiring a federal amenability standard in federal question cases generally. <em>See id. </em>at 515-17.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Having reviewed those authorities and others, together with the terms and history of Rule 4, we adopt the <em>Burstein </em>approach. To explain why, we will first briefly recount the <em>Burstein </em>analysis of Rule 4 and then discuss our other authorities in light of it.</p>\n<p id=\"b1350-4\">In <em>Burstein, </em>a Louisiana resident sued the State Bar of California under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 alleging that its erroneous grading of her bar examination violated her constitutional rights. In addition to this federal question, she also raised diversity claims of negligence and breach of contract. We can do no better than the <em>Burstein </em>court\u2019s own succinct analysis of Rule 4, so we reproduce it here in full:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1350-5\">Fed.R.Civ.P. 4 provides for service of process in cases brought in federal court. While by its terms rule 4(d) might well apply to this case, it is clear that rule 4(e) is designed for use to obtain service on parties not resident within the forum state, and by negative implication it excludes rule 4(d). <em>See </em>2 J. Moore, J. Lucas, H. Fink, &amp; C. Thompson, <em>Moore\u2019s Federal Practice </em>\u00b6\u00b64.32[1], 4.41-1[3] (1982). We thus direct our attention solely to rule 4(e), which has three provisions relevant to our analysis.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1350-6\">The first part of the first sentence of rule 4(e) applies \u201c[wjhenever a statute of the United States ... provides for service of a summons ... upon a party not an inhabitant of or found within the state in which the district court is held ...\u201d and the federal statute or a court order thereunder prescribes a manner of service. Jurisdiction is then asserted by the federal statute and service is made \u201cunder the circumstances and in the manner prescribed by the statute or order....\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"aqq-dedup-0\">The second part of the first sentence applies when a federal statute provides for service, thus asserting jurisdiction, but does not prescribe the manner of service. In that case, \u201cservice may be made ... in a manner stated in this rule,\u201d i.e., rule 4.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1350-10\">Neither one of these provisions applies to this case, because neither section 1983 nor section 1343 even \u201cprovides\u201d for service. It is thus necessary to examine the second sentence of rule 4(e), which states:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"auf-dedup-0\">Whenever a statute ... of the state in which the district court is held provides ... for service of a summons ... upon a party not an inhabitant of or found within the state, ... service may ... be made under the circumstances and in the manner prescribed in the statute. . ..</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1350-11\">The clear import of the \u201cunder the circumstances\u201d language, at least where the assertion of jurisdiction and not just the service of process depends on the state statute, is that a federal court, even in a federal question case, can use a state long-arm statute only to reach those parties whom a court of the state could also reach under it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1350-12\">693 F.2d at 514 (footnote omitted). To summarize, the <em>Burstein </em>court concluded that when a federal question case is based upon a federal statute that is silent as to service of process, and a state long-arm statute is therefore utilized to serve an out-of-state defendant, Rule 4(e) requires that the state\u2019s standard of amenability to jurisdiction apply. We think that this exposition of the Rule is the more sound.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1351-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1267\">*1267</page-number>One possible alternative to the <em>Burstein </em>analysis is that Rule 4(e) with its \u201cunder the circumstances\u201d language is only one alternate means of service upon non-residents, and that Rule 4(d)(7), providing for service in the \u201cmanner,\u201d but not under the \u201ccircumstances\u201d of state law, is by its terms equally available. Although reading Rule 4(e) as the <em>Burstein </em>court did \u2014 as exclusive in this context \u2014 seems the most sensible construction of the terms of Rule 4 as a whole, it is nevertheless true that the history of Rule 4 suggests that the drafters may have considered Rules 4(d)(7) and (e) to be alternative provisions for service of process outside the forum state. <em>See </em>4 C. Wright &amp; A. Miller, Federal Practice &amp; Procedure \u00a7\u00a7 1112-14 (1969) (discussing 1963 amendments to Rule 4); 2 J. Moore, J. Lucas, H. Fink, &amp; C. Thompson, Moore\u2019s Federal Practice \u00b6 4.32[1] at 4-342 n. 2 (1982) (same). Nevertheless, courts and commentators agree that even if Rule 4(d)(7) be treated as an alternative for out-of-state service, care must be taken not to read the amenability language out of Rule 4(e) in the process:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1351-5\">Rule 4(d)(7), however, is silent on the question of amenability to service, or more simply, when a state long-arm statute may be used.... Accordingly, when the rule is being used to apply a state long-arm statute, it must be read together with Rule 4(e), ... which does provide standards for service upon a party not an inhabitant of or found within the state. Specifically, the last clause of Rule 4(e) provides that out-of-state \u201cservice may be made <em>under the circumstances and in the manner prescribed in the state statute or rule.\u201d </em>(emphasis supplied). In other words, service under a constitutionally valid long-arm statute in a federal court is only possible in the situations where the in-state activities of the defendant would be sufficient to invoke the long-arm statute had defendant been sued in state court. The \u201cmanner of service\u201d language in Rule 4(d)(7) and the \u201ccircumstances of service\u201d language in Rule 4(e) must both be satisfied.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1351-8\"><em>Stanley Works v. Globemaster, Inc., </em>400 F.Supp. 1325, 1337-38 (D.Mass.1975) (citations omitted), <em>quoted in </em>2 J. Moore, et al., <em>supra, </em>\u00b6 4.41 \u2014 1[3] at 4-468; <em>Navarro v. Sedco, Inc., supra, </em>449 F.Supp. at 1357-58 n. 1 (\u201cAlternatively, the court notes that where Rule 4(d)(7) and 4(e) have been viewed interchangeably as authorizing extraterritorial service pursuant to state long arm statutes, personal jurisdiction questions have been analyzed both in terms of due process and amenability under the state statute that was invoked, notwithstanding the differences in wording between these parts of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1268\">*1268</page-number>the rule.\u201d), <em>citing Time, Inc. v. Manning, </em>366 F.2d 690 (5th Cir.1966) (discussed <em>infra); </em>4 C. Wright &amp; A. Miller, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 1114 at 469 (\u201cSince neither the Advisory Committee Notes nor the text of the rule provides any clear distinction between the two provisions and there is no apparent reason to prefer the use of one or the other rule in connection with extraterritorial service pursuant to state law, nothing should turn on plaintiff\u2019s use of Rule 4(d)(7) rather than Rule 4(e) or vice versa.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1352-4\">Having concluded that Rule 4 was properly interpreted and applied in <em>Burstein, </em>we must ask whether the principle of <em>stare decisis </em>prevents this panel from following it. <em>Burstein </em>discussed a number of prior Fifth Circuit decisions, concluding that none of them was inconsistent with its view of Rule 4. 693 F.2d at 515-17. By contrast, two of these cases were treated as controlling in <em>Lapeyrouse. Lone Star Package Car Co. </em>v. <em>Baltimore &amp; O.R. Co., </em>212 F.2d 147 (5th Cir.1954); <em>Terry v. Raymond International, Inc., </em>658 F.2d 398 (5th Cir. 1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b1352-5\"><em>Lone Star </em>is the source of the broad dictum applied in <em>Lapeyrouse </em>that amenability in federal question cases generally is governed by a federal standard. Nevertheless, it is clear that <em>Lone Star </em>does not preclude the interpretation of Rule 4 reached in <em>Burstein. </em>First, in an alternative holding, the <em>Lone Star </em>court held service of process proper pursuant to Rule 4(d)(3), which provides for service upon an agent wholly apart from any provision of state law. <em>See Burstein, </em>693 F.2d at 515; <em>Jim Fox Enterprises, Inc. v. Air France, </em>705 F.2d 738 at 741 n. 8 (5th Cir.1983). A much more critical distinction, however, is that <em>Lone Star </em>was decided in 1954, long before the 1963 amendments to Rule 4 added the second sentence of Rule 4(e). Thus, at the time of <em>Lone Star, </em>nothing in Rule 4 required that service of process ever be asserted \u201cunder the circumstances\u201d permitted by state law. <em>See </em>4 C. Wright &amp; A. Miller, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 1075 at 312-13 (discussion of 1963 amendments). Accordingly, even <em>Lone Star\u2019s </em>alternative holding that service was proper under Rule 4(d)(7) and the Texas long-arm statute is consistent with <em>Bur-stein. </em>The Rule as it then stood provided only for service in the \u201cmanner\u201d of state law, saying nothing regarding amenability. Had <em>Burstein </em>come upon the heels of the 1963 amendments to Rule 4, there would be virtually no question that it stated a proper modification of <em>Lone Star </em>in light of intervening legislative action.</p>\n<p id=\"b1352-11\">Unfortunately that was not the case. Like a Tower of Babel, our post-1963 pronouncements spoke in irreconcilable voices.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Without citing or attempting to distinguish <em>Lone Star, </em>or discussing the amendments to Rule 4, we at least twice applied a state standard of amenability in federal question cases. <em>Familia de Boom </em>v. <em>Arosa Mercantil, S.A., </em>629 F.2d 1134, 1138 (5th Cir.1980) (a Jones Act case in which the court cited a diversity case as stating the amenability standard and continued, \u201cwe must here decide if the defendants\u2019 contacts with Texas were sufficient to permit Texas to assert jurisdiction\u201d), <em>cert. denied, </em>451 U.S. 1008, 101 S.Ct. 2345, 68 L.Ed.2d 861 (1981); <em>Time, Inc. v. Manning, </em>366 F.2d 690, 693 (5th Cir.1966) (also applying the diversity standard). Not surprisingly, the lower courts under our supervision did likewise. <em>Bloom v. A.H. Pond Co., </em>519 F.Supp. 1162, 1165 &amp; n. 2 (S.D.Fla.1981); <em>Navarro </em>v. <em>Sedco, supra, </em>449 F.Supp. at 1357-58 n. 1 (relying in part upon <em>Manning, supra); Stanley v. Local 926, International Union of Operating Engineers, </em>354 F.Supp. 1267, 1270 &amp; n. 2 (N.D.Ga.1973). This was the state of the law when <em>Terry v. Raymond Int'l, Inc., </em>658 F.2d 398 (5th Cir.1981) was decided. <em>Terry </em>discussed neither the 1963 amendments to Rule 4 nor any of the intervening federal question cases that had applied a state standard of amenability. Rather, relying solely upon the broad language in <em>Lone Star, Terry </em>applied a federal standard, treating the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1269\">*1269</page-number>reach of the state long-arm statute as \u201cirrelevant.\u201d 658 F.2d at 402.</p>\n<p id=\"b1353-5\">The court in <em>Burstein </em>thought <em>Terry </em>distinguishable on its facts. <em>See </em>693 F.2d at 516. Although we are not s\u00fare that this is so,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> we <em>are </em>sure that it does not matter. Even if the facts in <em>Terry </em>were precisely equivalent to those in <em>Burstein, </em>the latter court could not be bound by Terry\u2019s result; one that was itself inconsistent with prior authority. Our court having failed to speak with one voice in the matter, there simply was no settled rule of law for the <em>Burstein </em>court to apply. In such a case, we think the best approach is to do what that court did: look to the Rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b1353-6\">In our case, as in <em>Burstein, </em>the Rule tells us to ask whether a Mississippi court could have asserted personal jurisdiction over the defendant. The LHWCA, like \u00a7 1983, the statute applicable in <em>Burstein, </em>is silent as to service of process in actions like the one before us. <em>See </em>33 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 905(b), 933 (1976); <em>but compare id., </em>\u00a7 921(c) (nationwide service of process provided in proceedings for review of a compensation award by a court of appeals). Accordingly, the second sentence of Rule 4(e) is applicable and requires that Woolsey be served \u201cunder the circumstances and in the manner\u201d prescribed by the Mississippi long-arm statute as interpreted by that state\u2019s courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b1353-8\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b1353-9\">The relevant portion of the Mississippi long-arm statute extends jurisdiction to any nonresident defendant \u201cwho shall commit a tort in whole or in part in this state against a resident of this state.\u201d <em>See </em>note 4, <em>supra. </em>This provision, which was added by amendment in 1964, has been authoritatively construed to extend the jurisdiction of Mississippi courts to hear cases like the present one:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1353-10\">Under the amended statute, a nonresident manufacturer of a dangerously defective or unsafe product who places it in interstate commerce for the purpose of distribution and ultimate sale to consumers in other States, whether with a specific intent that it be distributed, sold and used in this State or not, may be subjected to a personam action for damages in the courts of this State by such consumer who may be injured in this State as a result of its defective or unsafe condition.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Audc\"><em>Smith v.

Equipment Co. v. Port Huron &amp; Detroit R.R., </em>495 F.2d 1127, 1128 (7th Cir.1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b1355-5\">We have reviewed all the materials presented to the district court on the jurisdictional issue and conclude that the plaintiffs have made out a prima facie case. Certain facts are uncontroverted. Woolsey is a New York corporation and has neither qualified to do business in Mississippi nor received any license or franchise from that state. It has never directly or indirectly owned or leased property there. It has never maintained any bank account, office, telephone, book of account, or address in Mississippi. No employee or agent has ever lived there. In arguing that the absence of these contacts precludes jurisdiction, Woolsey glosses over one critical and undisputed fact. In its affidavits opposing the plaintiffs\u2019 motion to dismiss, Woolsey admitted that it sold its products to various Mississippi entities at its New Orleans office, and most important, that it shipped these products into Mississippi.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Thus, contrary to Woolsey\u2019s suggestion, this is not a pure \u201cstream of commerce\u201d case in which a sale, followed by the unilateral action of the purchaser in transporting the goods t\u00f3 a different state, is relied upon to subject the seller to the jurisdiction of that state\u2019s courts.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1355-9\">This is not a case in which the seller has structured its primary conduct to avoid contact with the forum state. <em>See World-Wide Volkswagen, </em>444 U.S. at 297, 100 S.Ct. at 567. Rather, by its own affirmative acts Woolsey has introduced its products into Mississippi for use in that state. By these shipments, Woolsey has \u201cpurposefully availed\u201d itself of the privilege of conducting activities in Mississippi and its \u201cconduct and connection with the forum State are such that [it] should reasonably anticipate being haled into court there.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Plaintiffs\u2019 pri-ma facie case on the purposeful availment issue has been made out.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1356-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1272\">*1272</page-number>In addition to Woolsey\u2019s \u201cpurposeful availment\u201d of the benefits of Mississippi, we find that the other relevant factors support the assertion of personal jurisdiction in this case. Principal among these is \u201cthe interest of the state in providing a forum for the suit.\u201d <em>Brown v. Flowers Industries, Inc., </em>688 F.2d at 333 (quoting <em>Austin v. North American Forest Products, Inc., </em>656 F.2d 1076, 1090 (5th Cir.1981)). Mississippi has an exceptionally strong interest in providing a forum for the redress of injuries to its residents occurring within its borders and caused by an allegedly defective product shipped from outside the state. <em>Cf. </em>Restatement (Second) of Conflicts of Laws \u00a7 146 (1971). This interest is based on more than the fact that the injured party is a Mississippi resident, though that fact alone is significant. Also important is the practical consideration that most product liability cases involve multiple parties. Where an accident caused by a defective product occurs within a state, it is likely that parties other than the plaintiff, such as retailers or employers, will also reside there. In this situation, the state has a substantial interest in providing a forum so that all claims arising from the accident may be litigated by its residents conveniently and efficiently in one court at one time. In these cases, the interest of the state is intertwined with the final factor discussed in <em>Brown, </em>the \u201crelative conveniences and inconveniences to the parties.\u201d 688 F.2d at 333. Thus, in the present case, where the plaintiff and two of three defendants reside in Mississippi, while the third defendant maintains a business location in nearby New Orleans, we find that the interests of the state, as well as the relative interests of the parties, favor exercise of jurisdiction by a Mississippi court. We therefore conclude based upon all considerations which we have discussed that plaintiffs have prima facie demonstrated that allowing this lawsuit to proceed in the Mississippi district court would not offend \u201ctraditional notions of fair play and substantial justice.\u201d <em>Insurance Corp. of Ireland v. Compagnie des Bauxites de Gui\u00f1ee, </em>456 U.S. 694, 703, 102 S.Ct. 2099, 2105, 72 L.Ed.2d 492 (1982) (quoting <em>International Shoe Co. v. Washington, </em>326 U.S. 310, 66 S.Ct. 154, 90 L.Ed. 95 (1945)).<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1356-7\">The judgment of the district court is reversed and this cause is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1356-8\">REVERSED and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1346-10\">. Because the basis of federal subject matter jurisdiction over Woolsey was not immediately apparent from the pleadings, we noticed that issue sua <em>sponte </em>and conclude that diversity jurisdiction is present. As it stood at the time of Woolsey\u2019s motion to dismiss, the complaint did not state the basis for federal subject matter jurisdiction over the claims against Wool-sey. Diversity of citizenship was precluded because both the DeMelos and Toche Marine were alleged to be citizens of Mississippi. Woolsey urged in its motion to dismiss that pendent party jurisdiction should not be asserted over the state law claims of breach of warranty and strict liability. In opposition to the motion, the DeMelos disavowed reliance upon pendent jurisdiction, and attempted to rechar-acterize those claims, arguing that products liability actions relating to \u201cmarine\u201d paint are within the maritime jurisdiction. Record at 117. However, this jurisdictional basis was <em>not </em>asserted in the complaint itself as required by Fed.R.Civ.P. 8(a)(1). Since the DeMelos did not attempt to amend to cure this defect, they cannot now rely on maritime jurisdiction. <em>E.g. Vacca </em>v. <em>Meetze, </em>499 F.Supp. 1089, 1090 (S.D. Ga.1980); 5 C. Wright &amp; A. Miller, Federal Practice &amp; Procedure \u00a7\u00a7 1214, 1350 (1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b1346-11\">Instead of ruling first on the question of subject matter jurisdiction, as would be expected, 5 C. Wright &amp; A. Miller, <em>supra </em>at 548, the district court dismissed Woolsey for lack of personal jurisdiction. Subsequently, with Woolsey no longer before it, but before this interlocutory appeal was granted, the district court permitted the DeMelos to amend their complaint to allege that they are Portuguese citizens and thereby invoke \u201cdiversity of citizenship ... as a separate ground of jurisdiction for all causes of action herein stated against TOCHE MARINE, GEORGE ENGINE, <em>or any other Defendant.\u201d </em>Amendment to Second Amended Complaint, Record at 244 (emphasis added). Finally, the facial allegations of the complaint were sufficient to assert jurisdiction over the claims against Woolsey. Since Woolsey has not claimed that allowing the plaintiffs to amend the complaint at that late date was an abuse of discretion, <em>see Altman v. Connally, </em>456 F.2d 1114 (2d Cir.1972), or that the allegations of citizenship are not supported by the facts, <em>Paterson v. Weinberger, </em>644 F,2d 521, 523 (5th Cir.1981), we conclude that our power to hear this case as to Woolsey is grounded in diversity jurisdiction. Moreover, we emphasize, in light of the tortured trail blazed by plaintiffs\u2019 counsel, that diversity is the <em>only </em>basis of such jurisdiction established in this case. The claims against the other defendants, of course, raise federal questions under the LHWCA.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1346-15\">. In our earlier decision in this case, we held that the DeMelos\u2019 interlocutory appeal is properly before this court. <em>DeMelo v.

These cases applied a federal amenability standard even in suits like <em>Burstein </em>and the present case, which are based only in part on a federal question, also raising claims in diversity. <em>E.g. Lone Star Package Car Co. </em>v. <em>Baltimore &amp; O.R. Co., 212 F.2d 147 (5th </em>Cir.1954) (discussed <em>infra).</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b1350-14\">. Professors Wright and Miller also resolve any ambiguities in favor of this interpretation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"aap-dedup-1\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1267\">*1267</page-number>When service is made under Rule 4(e) on a person not an inhabitant of or found within the state, it is unclear whether state or federal law governs amenability. It has been held that the phrase \u201cunder the circumstances,\u201d which was inserted in Rule 4(e) in 1963 regarding service under state statutes, concerns amenability to suit as well as the other circumstances relating to process and thus provides some specific evidence that the state test should control when service is made under Rule 4(e). This view seems particularly appropriate when a state statute relating to quasi-in-rem jurisdiction is used since the Advisory Committee Notes to the 1963 amendment seem to indicate a clear intent to conform to state practice in that context. It also should be pointed out that the word \u201ccircumstances\u201d does not refer to the nature of the claim but rather to the nature of the acts giving rise to the claim. Thus, service in the manner provided by state law may be made under Rule 4(e) even in cases exclusively within the federal question, rather than the diversity, jurisdiction of the federal courts.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1351-10\">On balance, then, it would seem that state law always should govern amenability when a state statute is used pursuant to Rule 4(e). Although the opposite result has some appeal in that it permits effectuation of federal interests in a broader range of suits, it is inconsistent with the apparent intent of the draftsmen of Rule 4(e) to use state provisions for service in order to permit the federal courts in a state to hear those cases that could be brought in the state\u2019s own courts when a basis for asserting federal subject matter jurisdiction exists.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1351-11\">4 C.

First, both involved service of process upon an out-of-state defendant. <em>Terry, </em>658 F.2d at 400 (in-state plaintiff served out-of-state defendant by mail). Second, both cases involved a federal question arising from a statute that is silent as to service of process. <em>Burstein, </em>693 F.2d at 514 (42 U.S. C.1983); <em>Terry, </em>658 F.2d at 402 (Jones Act). Thus, Teny would have come out differently under Burstein\u2019s theory: Rule 4(e) would have applied, requiring a state, not a federal, amenability standard. In Burstein the similarity of facts in these two cases was overlooked by focusing upon only one of two complaints filed in <em>Terry. A </em>third-party complaint was filed upon the Terry defendant\u2019s in-state employee, thus arguably falling outside Rule 4(e). See <em>Burstein, </em>693 F.2d at 516.

Kohn, </em>250 Miss. 138, 164 So.2d 785, 790 (Miss.1964), the Mississippi Supreme Court engrafted certain limits upon the reach of Mississippi\u2019s long-arm statute, such as a requirement that the cause of action arise from the defendant\u2019s contacts with the forum. Though this proposition perhaps was once true, it is no longer so. <em>Temco </em>held that the 1964 addition of the tort basis for long-arm jurisdiction was intended to broaden the scope of the statute beyond the limits previously recognized in <em>Mladinich </em>and cases like it. 252 So.2d at 215.

If it is true that Woolsey\u2019s shipments to Mississippi are so <em>de minimis </em>that exercise of jurisdiction would not comport with the requirements of the due process clause, Woolsey will have an opportunity to so demonstrate at trial or a preliminary hearing as the district court, in its discretion, may determine. <em>See </em>note 12, <em>supra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b1355-12\">. That, of course, was the jurisdictional theory rejected in <em>World-Wide Volkswagen, </em>444 U.S. at 295-99, 100 S.Ct. at 566-68.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b1355-13\">. In evaluating plaintiffs\u2019 prima facie showing on this issue, we have not found it necessary to consider other facts bearing upon Woolsey\u2019s contacts with Mississippi, which are inadequately developed in the record. However, we do not mean thereby to suggest that such facts may not be considered in deciding whether plaintiffs have carried their ultimate burden of establishing personal jurisdiction. <em>See </em>note 12, <em>supra. </em>For example, plaintiffs introduced affi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1272\">*1272</page-number>davits stating that two retail stores in Mississippi carry Woolsey paint; Woolsey responded that this paint was obtained from independent Louisiana distributors, not from Woolsey. Whether the activities of these distributors can be attributed to Woolsey will depend on Wool-sey\u2019s awareness of the activities. <em>See Oswalt v. Scripto, Inc., </em>616 F.2d 191 (5th Cir.1980) (defendant should have known of distributors\u2019 sales in forum state due to nationwide distribution arrangement); <em>Coulter v. Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co., </em>426 F.2d 1315 (5th Cir.1970) (actual knowledge of distributors\u2019 sales in forum state). By placing our decision on narrower grounds, we imply no views on this or other fact questions raised by the parties\u2019 affidavits and depositions but not expressly relied upon in this opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b1356-5\">. Our decision that personal jurisdiction is appropriate under the long-arm statute and the fourteenth amendment, though incorporating a constitutional issue, is nevertheless a statutory decision. It is required by Rule 4(e). <em>Burstein, </em>693 F.2d at 523 n. 16. Accordingly, there remains a further question in this case: does assertion of jurisdiction comport with the due process clause of the <em>fifth </em>amendment that binds federal courts independent of any statute or rule? In some cases, circumstances may be such that the requirements of the two due process clauses may diverge. <em>See, e.g., FTC v. Jim Walter Corp., </em>651 F.2d 251 (5th Cir.1981) (where federal statute provides nationwide service of process, fifth amendment requires minimum contacts only with the United States, not the forum state). <em>But see Burstein, </em>693 F.2d at 515-16 n. 8 (questioning vitality of <em>Jim Walter </em>after <em>Insurance Corp. of Ireland, </em>supra). However, we perceive no such circumstances here. For the same reasons that assertion of jurisdiction over Woolsey does not offend fourteenth amendment due process, we conclude that the fifth amendment is satisfied. <em>See Time, Inc. v. Manning, supra, </em>366 F.2d at 694.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
