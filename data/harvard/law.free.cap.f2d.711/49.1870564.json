The question we are asked to answer is when may food be a part of the minimum wage.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-13\">Relevant to our determination are a statute, a regulation promulgated by the Secretary of Labor construing that statute, and the Secretary\u2019s interpretation of his regulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-15\">The statute is section 3(m) of the Fair Labor Standards Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 203(m), which allows an employer to credit toward its obligation to pay the minimum wage \u201cthe reasonable cost ... of furnishing [an] employee with board, lodging, or other facilities, if such board, lodging, or other facilities are customarily furnished by such employer to his employees.\u201d The regulation is 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 531.30 (1982), which provides that board, lodging, or other facilities are \u201cfurnished\u201d for purposes of section 3(m) only where the employee\u2019s acceptance of them is \u201cvoluntary and uncoerced.\u201d The Secretary\u2019s interpretation of this regulation requires \u201cemployee choice\u201d: Acceptance of a section 3(m) in-kind benefit is not \u201cvoluntary and uncoerced\u201d unless the employee is regularly given the option of receiving his entire minimum wage in cash.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-16\">Relying on this interpretation, the Secretary sued Miller Properties for violating its duty to pay the minimum wage. A stipulation of facts by the parties distilled the case into a single issue: whether the Secretary\u2019s \u201cemployee choice\u201d construction of 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 531.30 is valid.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The district court found this construction inconsistent with the plain language of section 3(m) and entered judgment for Miller. 547 F.Supp. 785 (M.D.La. 1982). We affirm on the basis of <em>Davis Bros, Inc. v. Donovan, </em>700 F.2d 1368 (11th Cir.1983). That court\u2019s reasoning is adopted as the reasoning of our decision here.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-17\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b134-14\">. The stipulation provided that Miller\u2019s employees are paid a minimum wage composed partially of cash and partially of a section 203 \u201cmeal credit.\u201d This method of compensation is mandatory. No employee is afforded any choice. Some employees would prefer their wages in cash. All job applicants are apprised of the compensation scheme before they accept employment. Miller customarily furnishes meals to its employees, and the meal credit it takes is reasonable.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
