ROBINSON, III.</p>\n<author id=\"b309-6\">SPOTTSWOOD W. ROBINSON, III,</author>\n<p id=\"amo-dedup-0\">Chief Judge:</p>\n<p id=\"b309-7\">Petitioners challenge on both substantive and procedural grounds an order of the Interstate Commerce Commission granting the application of Gollott &amp; Sons Transfer &amp; Storage, Inc., for a permit to transport specified types of personal property in interstate commerce as a motor contract carrier. Our analysis of petitioners\u2019 claims reveals no reversible error, and we accordingly affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-8\">I. The Factual Background</p>\n<p id=\"b309-9\">Gollott &amp; Sons filed with the Commission an application, buttressed by two verified statements, for a permit to operate as a motor contract carrier to transport household goods, unaccompanied baggage, and used cars in interstate commerce under an agreement with Gulf Forwarding, Inc.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> This contractual arrangement contemplated that Gollott &amp; Sons would designate two vehicles<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> of which Gulf Forwarding would have preferential use continuously over a period of time,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> later ascertained to be one year.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> As preferential user of these vehicles, Gulf Forwarding would have power not only to ensure their availability to transport any and all of its intended shipments of the described personalty, but also to prohibit their hire by other shippers even when Gulf Forwarding did not use them fully or at all. Conversely, the contracting parties agreed that, if the consent of Gulf Forwarding was procured, Gollott &amp; Sons would have authority to use these vehicles for the benefit of other shippers when Gulf Forwarding had no transportation requirements, and even to haul other shippers\u2019 goods side-by-side with Gulf Forwarding\u2019s freight when the vehicles had excess capacity. Finally, in an effort to demonstrate the need for the authority requested, Gollott &amp; Sons represented that it would move lightweight or shorthaul shipments and perform residential pickups and deliveries for Gulf Forwarding, which services it claimed to be unavailable from other carriers yet neces<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>sary to satisfy the shipper\u2019s distinct needs.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b310-4\">Solely on the basis of the application and accompanying verified statements, the Commission granted the application preliminarily and published a statement to that effect in the Federal Register.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> This decision-notice contained neither findings of fact nor conclusions of law in support of the award.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Petitioners then protested the Commission\u2019s decision, urging various grounds for setting the preliminary grant aside.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b310-5\">In particular, petitioners contended that Gollott &amp; Sons had neither assigned specified vehicles for the exclusive use of Gulf Forwarding over a definite period of time nor contracted to provide services necessary to satisfy any distinct needs Gulf Forwarding might possess, and that the applicant had therefore failed to qualify as a motor contract carrier under Section 10102(13)(B) of the Interstate Commerce Act.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Petitioners further maintained that transportation of this type of personalty, especially on behalf of a commonly-controlled affiliate such as Gulf Forwarding, constituted common \u2014 not contract \u2014 carriage,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> that the vehicles purportedly dedicated by Gollott &amp; Sons to the use of Gulf Forwarding would clearly be insufficient to meet the latter\u2019s needs,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> and that, in any event, this arrangement would not promote either the public interest or the national transportation policy as required by Section 10923(a)(2) of the Interstate Commerce Act.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Finally, petitioners moved for vaca-tur of the preliminary grant on the ground that the brevity of the decision-notice violated Section 8(b) of the Administrative Procedure Act, as amended,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> and requested additionally that the Commission hold an evidentiary hearing and grant them leave to depose the applicant\u2019s witnesses in aid thereof.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b310-14\">After Gollott &amp; Sons filed a statement in reply,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> a Commission Review Board upheld the preliminary decision to grant the appli<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>cation.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> The Board fortified its decision by finding, first, that the contemplated contractual arrangement qualified Gollott &amp; Sons for motor contract carrier status under Section 10102(13)(B)<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> and, second, that the arrangement would serve the public interest because Gollott &amp; Sons proposed to provide Gulf Forwarding with otherwise unavailable services and none of the petitioners would suffer significant harm.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> At the same time, the Board denied the several outstanding petitions, holding that any deficiencies in the decision-notice had been cured by subsequent proceedings, and that petitioners had not sufficiently demonstrated that an evidentiary hearing or depositions would produce information relevant to the Board\u2019s deliberations to justify employment of those procedures.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Expectably, petitioners appealed from the Board\u2019s decision,<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> which the Commission affirmed in summary fashion.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Review by this court was then sought.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b311-5\">II. The Substantive Issues</p>\n<p id=\"AG7\">Petitioners\u2019 principal claim is that Gollott &amp; Sons has not qualified for a permit as a motor contract carrier under Section 10102(13)(B) of the Interstate Commerce Act.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> This provision specifies in pertinent part that status as a motor contract carrier can be acquired only by assigning specified motor vehicles \u201cfor a continuing period of time for the exclusive use of,\u201d<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> or by furnishing motor vehicle transportation \u201cdesigned to meet the distinct needs of,\u201d<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> one or more shippers. It is clear from a reading of the section that an applicant need satisfy only one of these demands.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-14\">The Commission found that the contractual arrangement here at issue, by which Gollott &amp; Sons accorded Gulf Forwarding preferential use of two designated vehicles for a period of one year, constituted sufficient dedication of these vehicles to satisfy the exclusive-use requirement of Section 10102(13)(B)(i). Petitioners, on their part, have advanced a literal and narrow reading of this provision, arguing in reliance thereon that the Commission\u2019s construction is impermissibly expansive. We find the Commission\u2019s outcome consistent with both its long-established interpretation of this section and the national transportation policy, as amended by the Motor Carrier Act of 1980,<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> and accordingly reject petitioners\u2019 contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>Under well-settled doctrine, a court will reject an agency\u2019s construction of a statute it administers only for \u201ccompelling\u201d reasons,<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> provided the construction was made contemporaneously with enactment of the statute<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> and has been followed consistently<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> over a lengthy period of time.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> Although the Commission has not heretofore decided precisely the issue implicated here, it has adhered without deviation and over many years to a particular interpretation of Section 10102(13)(B), the nascent promulgation of which was relatively concurrent with adoption of the exclusive-use test in 1957, which entails the conclusion that Gollott &amp; Sons measures up as a motor contract carrier.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-10\">In <em>Kansas-Arizona Motor Express, Inc., </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number><em>Conversion Proceeding,</em><footnotemark><em>31</em></footnotemark><em> </em>decided in 1960, the Commission first indicated that a carrier could qualify under the Interstate Commerce Act for motor contract transportation with respect to its agreement with a particular shipper even though the vehicles dedicated to that shipper could be used by other shippers at various times during the term of the agreement. The Commission held, more specifically, that the exclusive-use test did not preclude motor contract carriers from leasing their vehicles to other shippers for return trips following haulage of contracting shippers\u2019 goods, justifying this decision on the ground that backhau-lage for another shipper would not have \u201cany greater effect on the availability of applicant\u2019s equipment to its contracting shipper than would be the case with an empty movement.\u201d<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> The Commission further explicated this rationale two years later in <em>Connell Transport Company Extension </em>\u2014 New <em>York, New York,</em><footnotemark><em>33</em></footnotemark><em> </em>when it again held that backhaul-trip leasing does not negate motor contract carrier status; it stated that, when determining whether an assignment of vehicles is \u201cexclusive,\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Al9\">it is the substance of the arrangements and not their form with which we are concerned. Where there is substantial evidence of dedication of vehicles to a shipper\u2019s use under a continuing arrangement, and the facts demonstrate that this particular equipment will be constantly available to the contracting shipper in that arrangement, [backhaul-trip leasing is not inconsistent with motor contract carriage].<footnotemark>34</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b313-11\">This position later achieved its clearest and most conclusive articulation in <em>Owens Contract Carrier Application,</em><footnotemark><em>35</em></footnotemark><em> </em>when the Commission declared that the exclusive-use provision</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b313-12\">does not, in our opinion, necessarily require that specific vehicles be used for one shipper to the exclusion of all other shippers; we believe that the assignment of specific vehicles to shippers is contemplated by section 203(a)(15) [now Section 10102(13)(B)(i) ] [if] the contracting shippers have primary access to such equipment, may view such equipment as their own, and need not compete for its use either among themselves or with others.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b313-13\">Since <em>Owens, </em>this \u201cprimary access\u201d doctrine has governed the Commission\u2019s construction of the statutory provision here in dispute.<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> Applied to this case, the doctrine leads ineluctably to the conclusion that Gol-lott &amp; Sons has assigned two vehicles to the \u201cexclusive use\u201d of Gulf Forwarding, whose <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>status as preferential user entails the right of sole control over \u2014 and hence primary access to \u2014 these vehicles for the life of the contract. Accordingly, in the absence of compelling or other persuasive reasons to reject this well-established administrative interpretation of Section 10102(13)(B), we accept the primary-access doctrine and endorse its governance of the instant case.<footnotemark>38</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b315-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>There are, in addition, independent grounds upon which we affirm the Commission\u2019s holding that Gollott &amp; Sons qualifies as a motor contract carrier under Section 10102(13)(B)(i). Apart from the reasonableness of the agency\u2019s interpretation of the phrase \u201cexclusive use\u201d as encompassing contractual arrangements whereby the shipper, by virtue of its status as preferential user, has power to ensure that no other shipper can hire the dedicated vehicles for the duration of the agreement, the Commission\u2019s award comports with national transportation policy. By enactment of the Motor Carrier Act of 1980,<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> Congress reformulated that policy specifically to promote \u201cthe most productive use of equipment and energy resources.\u201d<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> As the Commission itself has implicitly recognized,<footnotemark>41</footnotemark> the construction of Section 10102(13)(B)(i) urged by petitioners would contravene the policy by promoting underutilization and even idleness of motor vehicles dedicated under this section. While, as petitioners point out<footnotemark>42</footnotemark> Section 10102(13)(B) nowhere expressly incorporates or even mentions the national transportation policy, the Commission clearly was justified to inform its interpretation and application of that section by reference to the policy. Section 10101(a) declares the national transportation policy<footnotemark>43</footnotemark> and Section 10101(b) explicitly provides that the statutory directives at issue \u201cshall be administered and enforced to carry out the policy of this section.\u201d<footnotemark>44</footnotemark> This is, moreover, precisely the result intended by Congress when, as a prelude to adoption of the Motor Carrier Act of 1980, it stated unambiguously that \u201c[t]he National Transportation Policy sets the tone for the regulatory structure and is the basis for determining the meaning of statutory provisions.\u201d<footnotemark>45</footnotemark> That the Commission\u2019s construction of the exclusive-use test thus promotes objectives central to the national transportation policy further vindicates, we think, the agency\u2019s decision to grant the application of Gollott &amp; Sons for a permit to operate as a motor contract carrier.<footnotemark>46</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b316-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>III. The Procedural Issues</p>\n<p id=\"AJ7\">In addition to their substantive claims, petitioners contend that the Commission conducted the administrative proceedings in derogation of their procedural entitlements. The primary claim in this regard<footnotemark>47</footnotemark> is that the Commission\u2019s original decision-notice, concededly barren of findings of fact or conclusions of law, violated Section 8(b) of the Administrative Procedure Act, as amended.<footnotemark>48</footnotemark> We find, however, that the failure of the decision-notice to proffer supportive factual findings and legal conclusions has not harmed petitioners in any way. We thus need not reach the merits of this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-4\">In Section 10(e) of the Administrative Procedure Act, Congress has mandated that \u201cdue account shall be taken of the rule of prejudicial error.\u201d<footnotemark>49</footnotemark> As applied to the case <em>sub judice, </em>this directive requires affirmance of the Commission\u2019s grant of the applicant\u2019s request for a permit to operate as a motor contract carrier. However much petitioners might at one time have been hindered in framing the contested issues, or in fashioning concomitant argumentation, administrative proceedings subsequent to the decision-notice provided petitioners with ample opportunity to discern and respond to the particular reasoning pursuant to which the Commission awarded the permit here contested. We thus find that petitioners have suffered no prejudice from the alleged deficiency in the decision-notice, and accordingly decline to utilize this putative error as the basis for reversal.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-11\">Our decision to affirm is further bolstered by a related doctrine. Courts often have refused to strike down an agency ruling for allegedly inadequate supportive explanation when reasonably able to discern the path of the agency\u2019s reasoning.<footnotemark>50</footnotemark> AI-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>though the courts generally have not applied this principle beyond cases in which the agency\u2019s rationale was ascertainable from the challenged decision itself, the logic of the doctrine extends to cases, such as this, in which the agency\u2019s course of reasoning is made apparent by reference to related administrative proceedings subsequent to the decision, here the decision-notice, that is alleged to be defective for lack of adequate explanatory materials. We find in this precept, then, even further support for our holding that later administrative proceedings dispelled any possible prejudice to petitioners from the brevity of the decision-notice, and that in light of Section 10(e) reversal is unwarranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-4\">The order under review is accordingly</p>\n<p id=\"b317-5\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b309-11\">.

Of course, even if an agency interpretation is not contemporaneous with enactment of the statute, is of short duration, or is inconsistent with prior agency promulgations, the thoroughness and validity of the agency\u2019s reasoning may entitle the interpretation to some weight.

See, <em>e.g., Samack, Inc., Contract Carrier Application Segundo, supra </em>note 34, 105 M.C.C. at 527 n. ***; <em>Francis A.

Respondents apparently have conceded that the decision here challenged departs from prior agency practice insofar as it holds that the exclusive-use test does not preclude a contractual arrangement under which other shippers\u2019 freight might be moved in the same vehicles as Gulf Forwarding\u2019s when excess space permits. See Brief for Respondents at 25-26. Our review of relevant Commission precedent, however, reveals that it is far from clear that the decision under review traverses agency practice in this regard. Although the Commission, in <em>Motor Haulage Company, Contract Carrier Application, </em>Docket No. MC-31214, 46 M.C.C. 107, 124 (1946), stated unambiguously that haulage is not exclusive if goods of two or more shippers are transported at the same time in the same vehicles, that case involved interpretation of a permit limitation rather than construction of legislation. Indeed, Congress did not enact the statutory provision here at issue \u2014 \u00a7 10102(13)(B) \u2014 until 1957, eleven years after the Commission decided <em>Motor Haulage, </em>see Pub.L. 85-163, 71 Stat. 411 (1957), codified as amended at 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 10102(13)(B) (Supp. IV 1980). The other two cases cited by the Commission are similarly inconclusive. While the Commission in <em>Owens Contract Carrier Application, supra </em>note 35, acknowledged <em>Motor Haulage </em>without overruling it, <em>id </em>at 38-39, the agency at the same time indicated that the case cannot be read as establishing the broad proposition that the exclusive-use test \u201cnecessarily require[s] that specific vehicles be used for one shipper to the exclusion of all other shippers,\u201d <em>id </em>at 39. Furthermore, in <em>Armored Carrier Corp. </em>Extension\u2014 <em>Wisconsin, </em>Docket No. MC-112750 (Sub-No. 127), 98 M.C.C. 314, 317 (1965), the Commission reiterated the <em>Motor Haulage </em>position without indicating whether the contracting shipper in the case before it nevertheless possessed primary access to the dedicated vehicles. <em>Armored Carrier, </em>accordingly, is of uncertain relevance to the case at bar, in which Gulf Forwarding clearly has primary access to the designated vehicles as preferential user. Taken on their own terms, then, these three cases do not, we believe, reveal holdings of sufficient clarity to justify the post hoc conclusion of the Commission\u2019s counsel that they interpreted the motor contract carrier provisions of the Interstate Commerce Act to preclude freight intermixture under all circumstances. Indeed, that counsel\u2019s reading of these cases places them in inexplicable contradiction with the primacy-access doctrine, to which the Commission has long and otherwise consistently adhered, only confirms our belief that the reading accords the cases unwarranted significance.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-8\">Even if, however, we accepted the argument that the decision under review charted new territory by granting the application despite the potential for carriage of other shippers\u2019 freight with that of Gulf Forwarding on dedicated vehicles, we still would affirm the Commission. It is well-settled that an agency is not bound to adhere strictly to the doctrine of stare decisis, but rather may modify or overturn prior norms or practices in line with evolving perceptions of the public interest, provided the agency recognizes the departure and justifies the new position by reasoned explanation.

In the instant case, the Commission acknowledged petitioners\u2019 claim of inconsistency between its decision and prior agency precedent, see <em>Initial Decision, supra </em>note 16, at 2, J.App. 122, but then, by reference to the Motor Carrier Act of 1980, justified its conclusion that Gollott &amp; Sons qualified as a motor contract carrier. <em>Id. </em>Because this legislation amended the national transportation policy to include the promotion of equipment and energy efficiencies, and, implicitly, because the contract by which Gulf Forwarding acquired rights as preferential user minimized underutilization of the two designated vehicles, <em>id., </em>the Commission refused to condemn such arrangements by technical and rigid construction of the exclusive-use test. In light <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>of this recognition and the eminently reasonable justification of the putative departure from earlier agency practice, we affirm the Commission\u2019s decision to adhere to the primary-access doctrine in finding that Gollott &amp; Sons qualified as a motor contract carrier.

Among them are that an award would be consistent with the public interest and national transportation policy, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 10923(a)(2), and that the applicant is \u201cfit, willing, and able\u201d to furnish the proposed services compliably with applicable statutes and regulations, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 10923(a)(1). Furthermore, to assist the Commission in ascertaining whether grant of the application would promote the public interest, Congress has required the agency to consider the nature of the intended transportation, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 10923(b)(3)(A), the injury inflicted upon protesting carriers by grant of the application, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 10923(b)(3)(B), the impact of a denial of the application upon contracting parties, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 10923(b)(3)(C), and the changing needs of contracting shippers, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 10923(b)(3)(D). In the case at bar, although petitioners contended before the agency that the preliminary grant should be set aside on the grounds that the applicant could not provide adequate transportation services and that neither the public interest nor the national transportation policy would be fostered by the award, see Protests of Global Van Lines, <em>et al., supra </em>note 2, J.App. 36-82, they have not pressed these claims here. We find, in any event, that the agency\u2019s decision-making on this score has not been legally deficient. The Commission assayed the factors enumerated in \u00a7 10923(b)(3), 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 10923(b)(3) (Supp. IV 1980). See <em>Initial Decision, supra </em>note 16, at 2, J.App. 122. Moreover, its determinations that the applicant is able to provide the proposed services and comply with applicable law, <em>id. </em>at 3, J.App. 123, and that the public interest and the national transportation policy sanction the award, <em>id. </em>at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>2-3, J.App. 122-123, are neither arbitrary and capricious nor bereft of substantial supportive evidence in the record.

Petitioners also maintain that, in light of the difficult burden of proof placed upon them by the Commission to demonstrate that Gollott &amp; Sons does <em>not </em>merit a permit to operate as a motor contract carrier, the Commission\u2019s denial of their petitions for an evidentiary hearing and leave to depose the applicant\u2019s witnesses in order to discover facts peculiarly within the applicant\u2019s knowledge infringes petitioners\u2019 Fifth Amendment right to due process of law.
