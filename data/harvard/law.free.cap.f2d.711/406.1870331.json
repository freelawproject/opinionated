Petitioner asserts that the Secretary\u2019s conclusion is not supported by facts on the record as a whole. We agree. The petition for review is, therefore, granted and the decision of the Secretary is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-5\">Minotto was employed by Conte, Inc. (the Company), a wholly owned subsidiary of American Specialty Foods, Inc., which markets fresh fruits and vegetables and is, therefore, subject to the Act. In November 1980 the enforcement branch of the Department of Agriculture filed a complaint against Conte under section 499f of the Act, charging the Company with failure to make full and prompt payment for 250 lots of perishable agricultural commodities received during August and September, 1979. When the Company failed to answer the complaint, the agency obtained a default order. <em>In re Conte, Inc., </em>40 Agriculture Decisions 620 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b491-6\">After obtaining the order of liability, the Department of Agriculture notified Company officers and directors, including Minotto, that they were \u201cresponsibly connected\u201d to the Company within the meaning of section 499h of the Act and therefore would be subject to employment sanctions.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The Chief of the Department\u2019s Regulatory Branch concluded that Minotto was \u201cresponsibly connected\u201d solely because she was a corporate director and she had attended nine corporate board meetings. File PACA D-0042; Joint Appendix (JA) 47. Minotto disagreed with the determination and requested a hearing.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b491-7\">The facts developed at the hearing are uncontested. Minotto was employed by Conte from 1974 until 1980 as a bookkeeper with secretarial and accounting duties. She had completed one year of post-high school business training and was twenty-three years of age when she began working for the Company. Although during her tenure Minotto was given additional clerical, bookkeeping, and accounting responsibilities, she remained an hourly employee.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-8\">In January 1976, Conte was restructured under a Chapter XI bankruptcy proceeding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>and Minotto was appointed to its newly created five-person Board of Directors.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Her election was solely for the convenience of the Company; because of her presence in the office, Minotto could be counted upon to attend Board meetings and to insure the availability of a quorum. The other four members of the Board were James L. Price, a director of the parent company, American Specialty Foods, and President of Conte; Samuel Schreffler, Secretary/Treasurer and later President of Conte; George McLaughlin; and Kenneth Kalligher, Vice-President of Conte. Minotto did not receive an increase in salary upon assuming a director\u2019s position, nor did she receive any stock as compensation for her new duties. Except to attend Board meetings, Minotto performed no additional work in conjunction with her appointment. During the four years of her directorship Minotto attended all nine Board meetings which were held. She never proposed any motions at these meetings, but is recorded as having voted in favor of all resolutions proposed. Minotto denied knowledge of the Company\u2019s transactions which gave rise to the underlying violations, and she asserted that such business was never discussed at Board meetings. The minutes of the Board meetings confirm her assertion.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-4\">Based upon this evidence, the Department\u2019s Hearing Officer held that Minotto was \u201cresponsibly connected\u201d with Conte during the time period when the violations occurred. Decision, PACA RC 81-1005 (June 21,1982); JA 102-11. Characterizing Minotto\u2019s directorship as being \u201cmore than nominal,\u201d the Officer reasoned that Minot-to\u2019s \u201cparticipation in the Board of Directors meetings\u201d was the \u201ccritical issue\u201d because her attendance assured the quorum necessary to enact resolutions dealing with the \u201cwell-being of the Company.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 8; JA 109. The Hearing Officer found the mere fact that Minotto was a director to be dis-positive, regardless of whether she exercised any real authority within the Company. Because she was found to be \u201cresponsibly connected,\u201d Minotto was subject to the employment sanctions of the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-7\">Minotto appealed, but the Department of Agriculture affirmed the Hearing Officer\u2019s decision. Decision, PACA RC 81-1005 (Aug. 6, 1982); JA 117. This petition for review followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-8\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-9\">As a \u201cdirector\u201d of a company which violated the Act, Minotto falls within the language of section 499a of the Act. However, that fact alone is not sufficient to render her automatically subject to the sanctions of the Act. In <em>Quinn v. Butz, </em>510 F.2d 743 (D.C.Cir.1975), this court established that being a director, officer, or ten per cent stockholder was only <em>prima facie </em>evidence that one was \u201cresponsibly connected\u201d to a company which had violated the Act. The <em>Quinn </em>court held the statute was not- intended to establish absolute liability. A finding of liability under section 499h of the Act must be premised upon personal fault or the failure to \u201ccounteract or obviate the fault of others.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 756.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-10\">At oral argument, counsel for the Department conceded that the Department\u2019s decision was not premised upon Minotto\u2019s failure to counteract the fault of others. Instead, the Department\u2019s decision was based upon its conclusion that Minotto was personally at fault. Conspicuously absent from the record evidence and from the Hearing Officer\u2019s findings of facts or conclusions, however, is <em>any </em>suggestion that Minotto knew or should have known of the Company\u2019s misdeeds. Her mere presence at Board meetings during which the illegal transactions were never discussed cannot be the basis for imputing personal knowledge to her. Such a conclusion would be the functional equivalent of an absolute liability standard which this court expressly rejected in <em>Quinn. See id. </em>The finding that an individual was \u201cresponsibly connected\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>must be based upon evidence of an actual, significant nexus with the violating company. \u201c[W]here the affiliation is purely nominal and the so-called [director] had no powers at all,\u201d the \u201cresponsibly connected\u201d determination cannot stand. <em>Id. </em>at 756 n. 84.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-5\">The record in this case clearly establishes that Minotto was no more than a nominal director. She lacked both the training and the experience to be an active director. She had no real authority within the Company and simply acquiesced in the decisions made by the Company President, her boss. The nominal nature of her role at the Board meetings was attested to by both the former President of the Company and a fellow member of the Board; she had no policy or decision-making role. She was essentially a clerical employee.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-6\">Notwithstanding her designation as a director, it cannot be said that Minotto was \u201cresponsibly\u201d affiliated with the Company. There is no evidence in the record to support the conclusion that Minotto knew or should have known of the Company\u2019s misdeeds. The fact that Minotto was an uncompensated, nominal director who attended Board meetings at the request of her employer does not support the conclusion that she was \u201cresponsibly connected\u201d to the violating company within the meaning of the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-7\">The petition for review is <em>granted </em>and the decision of the Department of Agriculture is <em>reversed.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b493-8\">\n<em>Judgment accordingly.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b491-9\">. The Perishable Agricultural Commodities Act regulates the shipment of perishable agricultural products in interstate and foreign commerce through a system of licensing and administrative supervision. As a precondition of doing business, merchants, dealers, and brokers in such commodities must obtain a license from the Secretary of Agriculture. Section 2 of the Act forbids licensees from engaging in certain enumerated unfair practices, including the failure to make prompt, full payment for commodities. An unfair practice subjects the licensee to liability for damages and to suspension or revocation of its license.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b491-10\">. The Secretary is authorized to limit employment, within the agricultural industry, of individuals who violate the Act. The Act provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b491-11\">(b) Except with the approval of the Secretary, no licensee shall employ any person, or any person who is or has been responsibly connected with any person\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b491-12\">(1) whose license has been revoked or is currently suspended by order of the Secretary \u2014</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b491-13\">7 U.S.C. \u00a7 499h (1976); and</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b491-14\">(9) The term \u201cresponsibly connected\u201d means affiliated with a commission merchant, dealer, or broker as (A) partner in a partnership, or (B) officer, director, or holder of more than 10 per centum of the outstanding stock of a corporation or association ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A85\"><em>Id. </em>\u00a7 499a.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-16\">The Secretary may approve the reemployment of such \u201cresponsibly connected\u201d person following the violating company\u2019s payment of a reparation award, or upon the individual\u2019s posting of a bond following one year of the employment sanction.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b491-17\">. The terms of the Act do not expressly require a hearing, but in <em>Quinn v. Butz, </em>510 F.2d 743 (D.C.Cir.1975), this court required the agency to provide \u201cresponsibly connected\u201d persons with an opportunity to rebut the agency\u2019s charge. The agency has complied with this judicial directive by implementing regulations governing the proceedings and review applicable in a \u201cresponsibly connected\u201d determination. 7 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 47.47-.68 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b491-18\">Neither party disputes that the \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d test is the applicable standard of review. The hearing authorized by the regulations, and which was in fact provided to Minot-to, was a formal, on-the-record adjudicatory proceeding. See <em>id. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 47.58-.63. Therefore, the substantial evidence test is appropriate.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b492-5\">. In December 1979, after the underlying violations by the Company were consumated, Mi-notto was appointed Assistant Secretary. In this capacity she was authorized to co-sign checks for the Company.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
