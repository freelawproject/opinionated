(\u201cthe Committee\u201d) appeals a final determination by the Federal Election Commission (\u201cFEC\u201d) that the Committee must repay $104,300.78 to the United States Treasury to cover primary campaign ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>penses that do not qualify under the Presidential Primary Matching Payment Account Act (\u201cthe Act\u201d), 26 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 9031-9042. We find that we do not have jurisdiction to review the FEC\u2019s final repayment determination because the Committee failed to file its petition for review \u201cwithin 30 days after the agency action by the [FEC] for which review is sought.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 9041(a). Therefore, we do not reach the issue of statutory interpretation raised by the Committee: whether the FEC properly interpreted <em>id. </em>\u00a7 9038(b)(2) to require the Committee to repay federal matching funds in an amount equal to the total of all funds, federal plus nonfederal, spent for nonquali-fied expenses, or whether the Committee need return only the proportion of nonqual-ified expenses that were paid for with federal funds.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b364-4\">I. Backgkound</p>\n<p id=\"b364-5\">It should not normally be difficult to decide whether a litigant has filed its petition for review within the 30-day jurisdictional time limit of 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 9041(a). Unfortunately, in this case the FEC\u2019s communications with the Committee failed to identify explicitly the point at which the time to appeal from the final decision began to run. Considerable confusion could be avoided in the future if the FEC would follow common agency practice and inform affected parties \u2014 by regulation or in the letter communicating its final determination \u2014 when the 30-day period for a petition for review begins to run. Because the FEC gave no such notice here, we find it necessary to outline the administrative proceedings in some detail to explain why we conclude that the Committee petitioned too late.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-9\">The sequence of events began on November 20, 1979, when the FEC decided that President Carter was eligible to receive matching federal payments for his campaign for the Democratic Party\u2019s 1980 presidential nomination.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Subsequently, his Committee received $5,117,854.00 in federal funds for the primary campaign. After President Carter received the Democratic Party\u2019s nomination, the FEC commenced its audit of the Committee as required by <em>id. </em>\u00a7 9038(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b364-10\">On November 7, 1980, the FEC\u2019s Audit Division sent the Committee an <em>interim </em>audit report and notified the Committee that it had 30 days in which to respond. The Committee submitted a response to the interim audit report on December 1,1980, <em>see </em>Supplemental Appendix (\u201cS.A.\u201d) at 1-7, and provided additional information on December 10. <em>See </em>S.A. at 8-21. In these letters, the Committee took issue with the Audit Division\u2019s allocation of expenses against state spending limits, which resulted in the Division\u2019s calculation that some expenditures were not \u201cqualified campaign expenses\u201d because they were over state limits. The Committee did not, however, contest the issue of the percentage of nonquali-fied expenses that it must repay even though the interim audit recommended that the amount of nonqualified expenses be \u201crepaid in full,\u201d <em>see </em>Interim Report at 14, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>record item 1; the Committee only noted that the interim audit report recommendations, if adopted, \u201cwould represent in effect a 100% penalty for alleged overspending\u201d on the order of $150,000.00, <em>see </em>S.A. at 20.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-4\">On January 19, 1981, the FEC sent the Committee the \u201cReport of the Audit Division.\u201d The FEC\u2019s cover letter noted that the FEC had approved the audit report and had made a determination, pursuant to 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 9038(b), that the Committee had to repay $129,443.70 within 90 days. <em>See </em>Joint Appendix (\u201cJ.A.\u201d) at 4. The letter further explained that under 11 C.F.R. \u00a7 9038.2(b) (1981) the Committee had 30 days to submit legal or factual materials in opposition to the FEC\u2019s repayment determination, and that the FEC would consider such materials in making a <em>\u201cfinal determination,\u201dthe </em>term used in <em>id. </em>\u00a7 9038.2 to describe the last step in the FEC\u2019s repayment evaluation process. <em>See </em>J.A. at 4 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b365-5\">On February 18, 1981, the Committee sent the FEC a \u201crequest for reconsideration\u201d of the repayment determination. The Committee\u2019s submission included a detailed section-by-section analysis that contested a number of findings in the FEC Audit Report. <em>See </em>J.A. at 23-36. The Committee also requested an extension of time in which to submit more materials<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and \u201creiterate[d] its request for a hearing.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>See </em>J.A. at 34. Again, the Committee did not take issue with the FEC\u2019s statement that the Committee would have to repay the full amount of nonqualified campaign expenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-13\">On June 9, 1981, the FEC voted unanimously to deny the Committee\u2019s requests \u201cfor an oral hearing on the issue of repayment of matching funds\u201d and for an extension of time to supplement its response to the \u201cFinal Audit Report.\u201d J.A. at 37. An FEC letter of June 12 communicated these denials to the Committee and explained that the Committee\u2019s challenge to the repayment determination brought into play 11 C.F.R. \u00a7 9038.2(e), which gave a protesting candidate 20 days to repay after receipt of the FEC\u2019s \u201cfinal repayment determination,\u201d with the possibility of a 90-day extension upon application. <em>See </em>J.A. at 38-39.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-14\">On July 7, 1981, the FEC sent the Committee its <em>\u201cfinal determination </em>that the Committee\u2019s repayment obligation [for exceeding state limits], pursuant to 11 C.F.R. \u00a7 9038.2(c), totals $117,826.15.\u201d J.A. at 40 (emphasis added). The FEC also included a statement of reasons as required by <em>id. </em>\u00a7 9038.2(d). The FEC had revised its previous calculation of the amount owed slightly downward because it had accepted two of the Committee\u2019s arguments about not applying certain expenses against state ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>penditure limits. In addition, the FEC explained that the Committee could further reduce this sum by documenting the amount paid for long distance telephone calls made from Iowa, New Hampshire, and Maine to national headquarters. Finally, the FEC reminded the Committee that according to <em>id. </em>\u00a7 9038.2(e), the Committee must repay the $117,826.15, subject to the documented phone call adjustment, within 20 days, although it could seek a 90-day extension of the repayment period. <em>See </em>J.A. at 40, 49.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-4\">On July 29, 1981, the Committee requested the 90-day extension for repayment as well as an extension of time to produce its long distance telephone records. <em>See </em>J.A. at 50. In a letter dated August 18, the FEC granted both requests. It gave the Committee until August 27 to produce the telephone records, after which \u201c[a] <em>final calculation </em>of the Committee\u2019s repayment obligation will be made,\u201d J.A. at 51 (emphasis added). Repayment of that obligation would be \u201cdue no later than November 6, 1981.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b366-5\">In a letter dated August 19, and therefore probably sent before the Committee received the FEC\u2019s letter granting the two requests for extensions, the Committee outlined its own view of the repayment timetable. First, the Committee pointed out that although the FEC\u2019s July 7, 1981 letter claimed to be a \u201cfinal determination\u201d pursuant to 11 C.F.R. \u00a7 9038.2(c), it could not be final until the interstate telephone expense data, which had been sent recently to the FEC, were \u201cconfirmed and subtracted from the interim repayment total ... of July 7th.\u201d J.A. at 52. Second, the Committee asserted that the 90-day repayment period should begin only after \u201call pending matters in connection with the underlying Report are resolved.\u201d J.A. at 53. The Committee explained that pending matters included not only the deduction of the long distance telephone charges, but also the Committee\u2019s appeal of its FOIA request for the FEC General Counsel\u2019s report on audit issues. Third, the Committee stated that it intended to make another filing with the FEC for reconsideration of the \u201cproposed audit findings,\u201d including \u201cthe Committee\u2019s purported repayment liability.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b366-7\">There is no evidence in the record that the FEC replied to the Committee\u2019s declaration of procedural independence. However, on October 27, 1981, the FEC notified the Committee that its long distance telephone documentation had been accepted and that the total repayment amount due was $104,-300.78 \u2014 the amount that the Committee now challenges. <em>See </em>J.A. at 55-56.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-8\">On December 10, 1981, the Committee sent a letter to the FEC concerning repayment terms. The letter noted that the Committee had already tendered $75,000.00 to the FEC, but that it \u201cseriously dispute[d]\u201d any additional amount. Then, and for the first time in any materials in the record, the Committee made the core assertion of this appeal:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b366-9\">[E]ven if it is assumed that a certain amount ... was improperly spent, we believe that the proper repayment obligation should reflect only that portion of the amount in question which is attributable to Federal matching funds. See 26 U.S.C. 9038(b)(2).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b366-10\">J.A. at 60. The next paragraph of the letter \u201coffers\u201d the FEC the Committee\u2019s repayment plan:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b366-11\">[W]e are prepared to tender to the [FEC] the balance in dispute ..., provided that the [FEC] agrees that we retain the right to continue to contest issues arising out of the audit determination, and provided further that the [FEC] agrees to certify for payment to our Committee any amounts which are finally determined not to have been owed by us in connection with the audit.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b366-12\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b366-13\">On February 4, 1982, the FEC provided an ambiguous reply. The FEC \u201cagree[d] that repayment by the Committee of the full amount determined by the [FEC] to be repayable will not substantively moot any disputed issues involved in the [FEC\u2019s] repayment determination.\u201d J.A. at 61. But the FEC stated that it did \u201cnot waive any substantive or procedural rights with re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>gard to any action which may be taken later by the Committee concerning repayment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Finally, however, the FEC stated that it \u201calso agrees that pending final <em>administrative </em>or judicial resolution of the issues in dispute the Committee may make repayment with the understanding that any amount of that repayment later deemed in excess of the requirements of Section 9038(b) will be paid to the Committee.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b367-4\">On February 25, the Committee tendered $15,000.00 to the FEC (raising the total paid to $90,000.00). It wrote that \u201cin accordance with the agreement embodied in our exchange of correspondence,\u201d repayment would \u201cnot substantively moot any disputed issues,\u201d and that the Committee could repay \u201c \u2018pending final administrative or judicial resolution of the issues in dispute\u2019 \u201d without waiving a right to a refund of excess payments. <em>See </em>J.A. at 62.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-5\">The next communication from the FEC to the Committee in the record is dated June 10, 1982. It recounts that in January 1982, the Committee \u201cpresented to the [FEC] ... a package of twelve letters and report amendments which, according to the [FEC\u2019s] Audit Division, represented a proposal by the [Committee] to reduce its outstanding [repayment] obligations.\u201d J.A. at 65.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The FEC letter then explains that this submission was \u201cout of time,\u201d and that FEC regulations do not provide for accepting \u201cadditional documentation after a final repayment determination.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 66. In the course of this explanation, the FEC notes the procedural framework for agency review that was noticeably absent from its February 4 letter. It reminds that: the FEC made its \u201cfinal determination\u201d on repayment in July 1981; the notification was accompanied by the required written statement of reasons; the Committee sought and received a 90-day extension for repayment, making it due by November 6, 1981; and the Committee received notification on November 2, 1981 [presumably the Oct. 27, 1981 letter], that the repayment amount had been reduced because the Committee had documented specific telephone charges as identified in the FEC\u2019s final determination. <em>See id. </em>at 65-66. In closing, the FEC added that it had not altered its previous decision to deny the Committee an oral hearing. <em>See id. </em>at 66.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-9\">On June 22, the Committee wrote the FEC that it understood that \u201call agency action with respect to the [FEC\u2019s] audit ... is now complete,\u201d and asked to be informed if this assumption was incorrect. J.A. at 67. On July 6, 1982, the Committee filed this petition for review of the FEC\u2019s action.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-10\">II. Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b367-11\">The first issue is whether we have jurisdiction. According to 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 9041(a),<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> a party must file a petition for review in this court \u201cwithin 30 days after the agency action by the [FEC] for which review is sought.\u201d This statutory time limit is \u201cjurisdictional and unalterable.\u201d <em>Cities of Batavia, Naperville v. FERC, </em>672 F.2d 64, 72-73 (D.C.Cir.1982) (footnote omitted) (60-day time limit to petition for review of an order under the Federal Power Act, 16 U.S.C. \u00a7 825l(b), is jurisdictional). <em>See also </em>Fed. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>R.App.P. 26(b) (a court may not enlarge the time prescribed by law for filing a petition from an order of an agency except as specifically authorized by law); <em>Pennsylvania v. ICC, </em>590 F.2d 1187, 1192-93 (D.C.Cir. 1978) (60-day time limit to petition for review of a final order under the Hobbs Act, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2344, is jurisdictional).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b368-4\">To determine which FEC actions may be \u201csubject to review\u201d (and thus trigger the jurisdictional time limit), we look to 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 9041(b). First, that subsection incorporates the definition of \u201cagency action\u201d in 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 551(13), to \u201cinclude[] the whole or a part of an agency rule, order, license, sanction, relief, or the equivalent or denial thereof, or a failure to act.\u201d Certainly the FEC action challenged by the Committee \u2014 the calculation of the Committee's repayment obligation \u2014 qualifies under that definition.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Second, \u00a7 9041(b) also instructs that 5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 701-706 establish the procedures for judicial review of FEC \u201cagency action.\u201d Under that chapter, judicial review is limited to \u201cfinal agency action\u201d unless the preliminary action has.been made \u201cdirectly reviewable.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 704;<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> <em>see FTC v. Standard Oil Co., </em>449 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>U.S. 232, 238,101 S.Ct. 488, 492, 66 L.Ed.2d 416 (1980). Therefore, the crucial question in this case is; <em>When </em>did this agency action become <em>final </em>so as to trigger the 30-day period in which the Committee had to petition for review?</p>\n<p id=\"b369-4\">The PEC contends that its July 7, 1981 letter \u2014 which informed the Committee of the FEC\u2019s \u201cfinal determination\u201d of the Committee\u2019s repayment obligation, subject only to subtractions for certain documented phone calls \u2014 was final agency action for purposes of judicial review. The FEC argues that the finality of its July action was not undermined by the Committee\u2019s opportunity to reduce minimally the amount owed through \u201cmechanically]\u201d documenting some phone calls. Government\u2019s Brief at 13 n. 14. The FEC also points out that even this adjustment was completed in October 1981.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The Committee responds that the repayment determination was not final for purposes of judicial review until June 10, 1982 \u2014 the date of the FEC letter that rejected additional documents from the Committee and denied again the Committee\u2019s request for an oral hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-8\">The Supreme Court recently discussed \u201cfinal agency action\u201d in some detail in <em>FTC v. Standard Oil Co., </em>449 U.S. 232, 101 S.Ct. 488, 66 L.Ed.2d 416 (1980) (relying heavily on <em>Abbott Laboratories v. Gardner, </em>387 U.S. 136, 87 S.Ct. 1507, 18 L.Ed.2d 681 (1967)). First, the Court in <em>Standard Oil </em>noted that \u201c \u2018[t]he cases dealing with judicial review of administrative actions have interpreted the \u2018finality\u2019 element in a pragmatic way\u2019 \u201d and taken a \u201c \u2018flexible view\u2019 \u201d of the matter. 449 U.S. at 239-40,101 S.Ct. at 493 (quoting 387 U.S. at 149-50, 87 S.Ct. at 1515-16).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>The Court then noted the indicia of finality on which it had relied in <em>Abbott Laboratories: </em>the administrative action challenged should be a \u201c \u2018definitive\u2019 statement[ ]\u201d of an agency\u2019s position; the action should have a \u201c \u2018direct and immediate ... effect on the day-to-day business\u2019 of the complaining parties\u201d; the action should have \u201c \u2018the status of law\u2019 \u201d; \u201c \u2018immediate compliance with the[ ] terms [should be] expected\u2019 \u201d; and the question should be a legal one \u201c \u2018fit for judicial resolution.\u2019 \u201d 449 U.S. at 239-40, 101 S.Ct. at 493 (quoting 387 U.S. at 151-54, 87 S.Ct. at 1516-19).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b370-4\">Although less detailed than <em>Standard Oil, </em>the Supreme Court\u2019s explanation of the finality doctrine in <em>Port of Boston Marine Terminal Ass\u2019n v. Rederiaktiebolaget Transatlantic, </em>400 U.S. 62, 91 S.Ct. 203, 27 L.Ed.2d 203 (1970), is significant because, like the case before us, it involved the application of a jurisdictional time limit for petitions for review. In <em>Rederiaktiebolaget Transatlantic, </em>a shipper attempted to attack collaterally a Federal Maritime Commission (\u201cFMC\u201d) order that it had not appealed; one of the shipper\u2019s arguments was that the FMC order was not final because \u201cit had no independent effect on anyone.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 70-71, 91 S.Ct. at 209-10. The Court, however, found that the FMC\u2019s order was indeed final, and that the shipper had missed its opportunity to seek review in the court of appeals within the statutory 60-day time limit. <em>Id. </em>at 71-72, 91 S.Ct. at 209-10. It explained that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b370-8\">[T]he relevant considerations in determining finality are whether the process of administrative decision-making has reached a stage where judicial review will not disrupt the orderly process of adjudication and <em>whether rights or obligations have been determined </em>or legal consequences will flow from the agency action.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"am-dedup-0\"><em>Id. </em>at 71, 91 S.Ct. at 209. (emphasis added) (citations omitted).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b370-9\">If we are to interpret finality in a \u201cpragmatic\u201d fashion, however, we need to consider whether finality should be analyzed differently when the determination forecloses review altogether rather than merely delays the appeal. In most finality cases the question is whether a party can appeal an agency action now or must wait until some subsequent agency action occurs. Thus, in <em>Abbott Laboratories, </em>the Court introduced its analysis of ripeness \u2014 of which its discussion of finality was a part\u2014 by explaining that it had \u201cto evaluate both the fitness of the issues for judicial decision and the hardship to the parties of <em>withholding </em>court consideration.\u201d 387 U.S. at 149, 87 S.Ct. at 1515 (emphasis added). Here, on the other hand, we must balance the FEC\u2019s interest in prompt review of a final repayment obligation against the hardship to the Committee from foreclosing its right to judicial review of that final obligation. The Committee claims that it was only trying to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>exhaust the administrative process, to avoid rushing to court, and that by cutting off its right to review altogether we ill-serve the interests underlying the finality doctrine because we create an incentive to petition prematurely.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-4\">Yet, so far as we can tell, the different consequences of finality determinations in these two situations have not led courts to devise different criteria for assessing when agency action is final. Cf. <em>Rederiaktiebola-get Transatlantic, </em>400 U.S. at 70-72, 91 S.Ct. at 209-10. This seems reasonable: Insofar as a finality determination establishes a point on the time line of an administrative process, that point should signal if an appeal is too late as well as if one is too early. It is logical that when Congress created time limits in which to appeal, such as the 30-day period here, it wanted the time to run from the first day a party is presumed to know it may file a petition for review. If we instead found that there was some interlude between the earliest date a petition may be filed and the date from which to start counting the 30-day period, we would undermine the very purpose of Congress\u2019 statutory time limit. Moreover, the criteria for evaluating the finality of agency action should be suitable for providing notice both to parties who are eager and waiting to appeal, and to parties who want to continue discussions with an agency up to the last minute.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-7\">We now apply the Court\u2019s guidance on finality to the FEC\u2019s calculation of the Committee\u2019s repayment obligation. We conclude, as explained below, that the repayment obligation became final for purposes of judicial review no later than October 27,1981. Indeed, the FEC has a cogent argument that its repayment determination of July 7, 1981, started the 30-day period running, even though the final dollar figure was dependent on the documentation and subtraction of certain telephone calls.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> We need not select between July 7 and October 27 (when the adjustment for phone calls was completed), however, because the date the Committee eventually filed its petition (July 6, 1982) was long past the 30-day period triggered by either time.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-8\">Our evaluation of when the repayment determination became final is based on an examination of how the audit process was performed and whether it produced a result that satisfies the Court\u2019s tests for finality. We believe that the FEC regulations outline a clear process for determining a definitive repayment obligation that has the status of law, and that the FEC took pains to explain each step as it moved toward final administrative resolution of the issues on which the Committee might seek judicial review.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b372-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>Under the regulations in effect at the time, <em>see </em>11 C.F.R. \u00a7 9038.1 (1982), the administrative review process began with an audit of a committee\u2019s campaign expenses. The FEC divided the audit process into interim and final audit reports to give committees an opportunity to respond before any repayment determination was made and released to the public.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> The FEC sent the Committee the interim report on November 7, 1980, and the Committee submitted responses on December 1 and 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-4\">The next step was the FEC\u2019s release of its formal \u201cReport of the Audit Division\u201d on January 19,1981. At that time the FEC explained to the Committee where it stood in the regulatory process: The FEC\u2019s audit had resulted in a <em>repayment determination </em>under 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 9038(b) and 11 C.F.R. \u00a7 9038.2, but under <em>id. </em>\u00a7 9038.2(b) the Committee had 30 more days for another reply before the FEC would make a <em>final determination. </em>Again, the Committee responded with detailed comments. The Committee also wanted more time and an oral hearing, which had once been but was no longer available under FEC regulations. When the FEC communicated its denial of these requests on June 12,1981, it again delineated the Committee\u2019s progress through the process: Under <em>id. </em>\u00a7 9038.2(e) the Committee would have 20 days to pay (with a possible 90-day extension) after the FEC\u2019s \u201cfinal determination.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b372-8\">About a month later (July 7) and eight months after the FEC gave the Committee its interim audit report, the FEC made its <em>final repayment determination. </em>An agency\u2019s characterization of finality is not necessarily decisive.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> But in this case the characterization fits neatly a pattern of agency action indicating the FEC had completed its process and imposed a formal repayment obligation on the Committee. The FEC\u2019s July 7 letter pointed out that the determination was pursuant to <em>id. </em>\u00a7 9038.-2(c), included the FEC\u2019s reasons as required by <em>id. </em>\u00a7 9038.2(d), and noted that the timetable for repayment was set by <em>id. </em>\u00a7 9038.-2(e). The only way a reduction in the sum owed could be achieved was through the ministerial task of providing documentation for a select set of phone calls. This one avenue for adjustment was left open because in the final negotiations the FEC accepted an argument as to the status of these calls. There was no indication that this minor concession in any way represented a reopening of full-scale discussions about what were \u201cqualified campaign expenses.\u201d At this point the FEC clearly expected the Committee to repay matching funds equal in amount to the nonqualified expenses \u2014 all the repayment figures produced by the FEC were calculated this way. Nothing in the record over the eight month audit period suggests that the Committee <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>contested the FEC\u2019s interpretation of 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 9038(b)(2) or advocated the different type of repayment calculation that it now advances.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-4\">In sum, we conclude that the FEC\u2019s process was designed to arrive at exactly the type of final action that is ready for judicial review. Application of the <em>Standard Oil-Abbott Laboratories </em>criteria and the <em>Rederiaktiebolaget Transatlantic </em>principles reaffirms that the process in fact produced a final agency action. The repayment amount, including a reasoned explanation about how the FEC arrived at it, is indeed a \u201cdefinitive statement\u201d of obligation that the FEC is directed to make by statute. Because the administrative review process was complete, judicial review of the determination of obligation certainly could not disrupt the FEC\u2019s decisionmaking. The fact that money was supposed to be repaid to the U.S. Treasury within 20 days (with a possible 90-day extension) certainly created a \u201cdirect and immediate effect\u201d and the expectation of \u201cimmediate compliance.\u201d Since this calculation is mandated by 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 9038, it also has \u201cthe status of law.\u201d Moreover, the legal question the Committee wants us to answer \u2014 how much of the nonqualified expenses must it repay under <em>id. </em>\u00a7 9038 \u2014 was \u201cfit for judicial resolution\u201d after the FEC\u2019s final determination.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Finally, Congress has expressed a strong interest in resolving federal matching fund audits expeditiously.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b373-7\">The Committee seeks to dissuade us from this conclusion by arguing that this case is similar to those where courts have preserved an appeal right by concluding that agency action is not final because the \u201cagency [left] room for genuine and reasonable doubt as to the applicability of its orders or regulations.\u201d <em>Recreation Vehicle Industry Ass\u2019n v. EPA, </em>653 F.2d 562, 569 (D.C.Cir.1981). In <em>Recreation Vehicle, </em>EPA \u201cleft unclear the applicability of its truck regulations to the motor home industry.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 568. This court would not permit EPA to \u201ctake advantage of the obscurity of intentions in order to defeat rights statutorily conferred,\u201d where the party claiming jurisdiction made a prompt request for clarification that lent credence to its claim that it was confused about the applicability of the regulations. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b373-8\"><em>Sam Rayburn Dam Electric Cooperative v. FPC, </em>515 F.2d 998 (D.C.Cir.1975), <em>cert, denied, </em>426 U.S. 907, 96 S.Ct. 2229, 48 L.Ed.2d 832 (1976), involved a similar problem. In <em>Sam Rayburn Dam, </em>the first of two FPC orders was unclear about whether petitioner\u2019s rates would be materially affected, and therefore the petitioner did not move for reconsideration until the second order revealed it would in fact be \u201caggriev<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>ed.\u201d The court recognized that petitioner\u2019s claim of confusion was reasonable, it had nothing to gain from delaying its protest, and its \u201cspeedy filing of an application for rehearing\u201d after it knew it was aggrieved was significant evidence of good faith. 515 F.2d at 1007. The court did not want to:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"aqe-dedup-0\">permit an administrative agency to enter an ambiguous or obscure order, wilfully or otherwise, wait out the required time, then enter an \u201cexplanatory\u201d order that would extinguish the review rights of parties prejudicially affected.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b374-4\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b374-5\">The Committee urges that there is analogous confusion here that undermines any finding of final action before June 1982. It contends that the FEC\u2019s \u201cfinal repayment determination\u201d (of either July or October, 1981) could not have been final agency action because the FEC itself did not seem to treat it as such. In particular, the Committee points to the ambiguous letter of February 4,1982, sent in response to the Committee\u2019s proposal for repayment terms. This letter sought both to preserve the FEC\u2019s \u201csubstantive or procedural rights\u201d and to reassure the Committee that it could get its money back after \u201cfinal administrative or judicial resolution of the issues in dispute.\u201d J.A. at 61. It is, of course, possible to read the FEC\u2019s reference to judicial review (even though under the FEC\u2019s argument the 30-day period for petitioning for review had already run) as simply a recognition that the Committee had a right to seek judicial review \u2014 even if it only culminated in a decision that the court did not have jurisdiction. The FEC has never satisfactorily explained what it had in mind when it referred to <em>final administrative </em>resolution.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-6\">Nonetheless, we conclude for a number of reasons that the FEC\u2019s actions here, and its February 4,1982 letter in particular, do not warrant any adjustment in our finding that the repayment obligation was final for purposes of review by October 1981. First, the February 4 letter could not possibly have influenced the Committee\u2019s decision to appeal within 30 days of the FEC\u2019s \u201cfinal determination\u201d in July 1981 or its final calculation in October 1981 because it was sent long afterwards. Second, the FEC\u2019s actions prior to the February 4 letter (and after it, too) followed closely the FEC\u2019s audit and repayment assessment process, as set out in its regulations; there was no reason for the Committee to be confused about what was happening during the eight month administrative review of 1980-81 that culminated in the FEC\u2019s statement about the Committee\u2019s \u201cfinal\u201d repayment obligation. Third, the FEC\u2019s final repayment determination, unlike the agency actions in <em>Recreation Vehicle </em>and <em>Sam Rayburn Dam, </em>made it crystal clear that the FEC had imposed an obligation and that the Committee was sup-, posed to pay it; this was not a situation where the scope of regulations was unclear or the application of an order was ambiguous. Fourth, while we can only speculate on whether the Committee was trying to reorder the audit and repayment process to its own end, the Committee\u2019s actions surely did not approximate the prompt request for clarification in <em>Recreation Vehicle </em>or the speedy action to remedy the late filing in <em>Sam Rayburn Dam. </em>The Committee did not even raise the legal question about the portion of nonqualified expenses it must repay until December 1981, and its communications regarding the repayment process read more like pronouncements than inquiries. Fifth, we note that even the FEC\u2019s February 4 letter warned that the agency was not forfeiting any procedural or substantive rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-8\">True, the FEC\u2019s enigmatic statements in the February 4 letter were an ill-concocted blend of boilerplate and courtesy in the face of the Committee\u2019s insistent efforts to establish its own audit and repayment process through unilateral declarations. If Congress\u2019 time limits on petitions for review are to have any jurisdictional bite, however, petitioners should not be allowed to overrun them by barraging an agency with missives on its own theories of how the administrative process should operate. The FEC\u2019s faltering response, made after the time for appeal had run, does not by itself provide a sufficient justification to stop the statutory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>clock. <em>See Boston Gas Co. v. FERC, </em>575 F.2d 975, 978-79 (1st Cir.1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b375-5\">III. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b375-6\">We have no jurisdiction to review the FEC\u2019s final repayment determination because the Committee failed to file its petition for review \u201cwithin 30 days after the agency action by the [FEC] for which review is sought,\u201d 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 9041(a); therefore, the Committee\u2019s petition is</p>\n<p id=\"b375-7\">\n<em>Dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b364-6\">. The Committee proposes that the FEC calculate the amount of federal funds spent on non-qualified expenses by computing the ratio of federal matching funds to total campaign funds and then applying that ratio to the amount of nonqualified expenses. <em>(E.g., </em>if 25% of a committee\u2019s funds were from federal matching payments and the committee had $2000 of non-qualified campaign expenses, then the committee would repay $500 to the government.) This is the repayment approach Congress designed for a committee that has a surplus. 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 9038(b)(3).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b364-7\">. The Presidential Primary Matching Payment Account Act (\u201cthe Act\u201d), enacted in 1974, provides matching funds for some contributions to presidential primary election campaigns. Candidates who meet the eligibility requirements of 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 9033 are entitled to matching funds to help pay for \u201cqualified campaign expenses,\u201d <em>see id. </em>\u00a7 9032(9). Under <em>id. </em>\u00a7 9035, campaign expenditures are not \u201cqualified\u201d if they exceed certain spending limits, which include both an overall campaign spending ceiling as well as limits on campaign expenditures in each state. Campaign expenditures over these limits create a repayment obligation under <em>id. </em>\u00a7 9038(b)(2). Most of the disagreements between the FEC and the Committee during the audit and repayment calculation process involved the assignment of expenses against state limits.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b365-6\">. The Committee sought an extension of time in which to reply to the FEC\u2019s final audit report (which formed the basis for the initial repayment determination) because it wanted to comment further after examining the FEC General Counsel\u2019s memorandum on the audit report. After being denied access to the General Counsel\u2019s paper, the Committee had filed a Freedom of Information Act request for it on February 13, 1981. <em>See </em>J.A. at 24, 34.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b365-7\">. It is not clear from the record when the Committee first requested an oral hearing. In the Committee\u2019s February 18, 1981 response, it complained that the FEC\u2019s regulations used to contain a provision for a hearing on the repayment determination and asserted that such a hearing was justified now even though the \u201cnew\u201d regulations no longer contained an \u201cexplicit hearing right.\u201d See J.A. at 34-35 (citing 11 C.F.R. \u00a7 134.2(b) (1979), <em>superseded on </em>May 7, 1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b365-11\">On April 30, 1981, counsel for the various presidential candidate committees sent a joint letter to the FEC urging it to change a number of its policies, including its denial of opportunity for oral hearings. <em>See </em>J.A. at 74-80. The FEC treated this joint letter as a general comment on its procedures, not as a filing in any one case, and sent a general response on May 14. <em>See </em>J.A. at 71-73.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-16\">As noted in the text, the FEC notified the Committee by letter of June 12, 1981, that it had denied the Committee\u2019s request for an oral hearing. This notice was sent almost a month before the FEC\u2019s \u201cfinal determination\u201d of the Committee\u2019s repayment obligation. Thus, there was no reason for the Committee to believe it need not file a petition for review of the \u201cfinal determination\u201d because of the possibility of a future oral hearing. The FEC\u2019s decision two years later to provide an opportunity for an oral presentation in its regulations does not excuse the Committee\u2019s delay here. <em>See </em>48 Fed.Reg. 5224, 5249, 14347, 16237 (1983) (effective Apr. 4, 1983) (to be codified at 11 C.F.R. \u00a7 9038.2(c)(3)).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b367-6\">. The Committee apparently proposed to convert payments it owed former Committee personnel into in-kind contributions or exempt travel expenses. It then hoped to convince the FEC that these amounts should be subtracted from the expenditure totals for Iowa, Maine, and New Hampshire because the amounts would no longer represent payments by the Committee. By reducing the totals spent in these three states, the Committee thought it could decrease the sum it spent over state expenditure limits by about $2,600 and thereby reduce its repayment obligation. See J.A. at 65.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b367-7\">. 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 9041 states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b367-12\">(a) Review of agency action by the Commission. \u2014 Any agency action by the Commission made under the provisions of this chapter shall be subject to review by the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit upon petition filed in such court within 30 days after the agency action by the Commission for which review is sought.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b367-13\">(b) Review procedures. \u2014 The provisions of chapter 7 of title 5, United States Code, apply to judicial review of any agency action, as defined in section 551(13) of title 5, United States Code, by the Commission.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b368-5\">. The \u201cCommittee does not dispute that the 30-day filing period set forth in [\u00a7] 9041 is jurisdictional in nature.\u201d Committee\u2019s Reply Brief at 10. However, because we have an independent responsibility to examine jurisdictional issues, we also note why we believe the time limit in this case is distinguishable from a nonjurisdictional filing requirement like the one involved in 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-5(e). <em>See Zipes v. Trans World Airlines, </em>455 U.S. 385, 392-98, 102 S.Ct. 1127, 1132-35, 71 L.Ed.2d234 (1982). In determining whether the filing requirement in <em>Zipes </em>was jurisdictional, the Court analyzed \u201c[t]he structure of Title VII [of the Civil Rights Act of 1964], the congressional policy underlying it, and the reasoning of our cases.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 393, 102 S.Ct. at 1132. The statutory structure is the key element here because we do not have any useful legislative history or case law with which to supplement it. Section 9041 includes both the grant of jurisdiction to this court and the time period for <em>filing in this court; </em>in contrast, <em>Zipes </em>points out that Title VII contains separate provisions that grant jurisdiction in the district courts and that specify the time for <em>filing charges with the EEOC. </em>455 U.S. at 393-94, 102 S.Ct. at 1132-33. As this difference in statutory structure suggests, the statutes reflect different congressional policies. Title VII integrates the efforts of laymen who may be victims of discrimination, the EEOC, and the courts. The laymen initiate the process and the EEOC is available in part to provide support for meritorious claims. In contrast, \u00a7 9041, like the other jurisdictional time limits cited in text, prescribes <em>judicial </em>review procedures that <em>follow </em>a detailed administrative review process between <em>two </em>legally sophisticated parties (a campaign committee and the FEC).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"AY_\">.

The exist<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>ing law at that time included a court-imposed finality requirement as a prerequisite for judicial review. <em>See </em>Final Report of the Attorney General\u2019s Committee on Administrative Procedure, <em>Administrative Procedure in Government Agencies, </em>S.Doc. No. 8, 77th Cong., 1st Sess. 85 (1941) (\u201cLegislation which limits judicial review to \u2018final\u2019 orders merely enacts the self-imposed policy of the courts.\u201d); <em>Attorney General\u2019s Manual on the Administrative Procedure Act </em>101, 102 (1947) (\u201cMoreover, many regulatory statutes, either expressly or <em>as they are interpreted, </em>have provided for review of (and only of) \u2018final\u2019 agency orders, with the result that the judicial construction of such provisions will carry over \u2014 \u201d) (emphasis added) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b369-6\">We recognize that the finality mandate in \u00a7 704 is tempered with a caveat that Congress may decide to make a \u201cpreliminary, procedural, or intermediate agency action\u201d \u201cdirectly reviewable.\u201d We conclude, however, that Congress did not craft 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 9041 to fit that exception. The statutory language merely states that judicial review is available; it does not delineate a set of \u201cdirectly reviewable\u201d actions or include any language that might raise doubts about maintaining the finality requirement. Nothing in the legislative history of the APA suggests that a statute that simply states, as does \u00a7 9041(a), that any agency action is reviewable, has displaced the finality test. On the contrary, the Senate Judiciary Committee explained that one purpose of \u00a7 704 was \u201cto negative any intention to make reviewable merely preliminary or procedural orders where there is a subsequent and adequate remedy at law available, as is presently the rule.\u201d 1945 Sen. Print 27, <em>APA Leg.Hist. </em>37 (citations omitted). Moreover, the incorporation of the judicial review procedures of chapter 7 of title 5 through 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 9041(b) raises the inference that Congress expected the finality limitation of 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 704 to apply. Finally, we note that even if \u00a7 9041(b) did not refer to the judicial review procedures of the APA, courts commonly impose a finality requirement where statutes simply provide for judicial review of agency actions. <em>See, e.g., Association of National Advertisers, Inc. v.

The interim audit is now formally included in the regulations on the FEC\u2019s audit and repayment process. <em>See </em>48 Fed.Reg. 5224, 5247-48, 14347, 16237 (1983) (effective Apr. 4, 1983) (to be codified at 11 C.F.R. \u00a7 9038.1).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b372-7\">. <em>See, e.g., Fidelity Television, Inc. v.

Our conclusion that the FEC\u2019s determination of the Committee\u2019s repayment obligation was final agency action is buttressed in two respects by <em>Reagan Bush Comm. v.

We see no reason why the point of finality should differ for final repayment determinations under the primary and general election funding acts. Second, the district court issued its decision in <em>Reagan Bush Committee </em>on November 17, 1981 \u2014within 30 days of the FEC\u2019s notice of its final <em>calculation </em>of the repayment amount (October 27). The availability of this judicial statement on when a party may appeal an FEC final repayment decision tends to undermine any argument the Committee might make that it was unaware of the need to appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b373-9\">. \u201cCongress was troubled by the inability of the FEC to make prompt disclosure of the audit reports it prepared following the 1976 election, and it was this concern that ultimately prompted the [FEC] ... to streamline the audit process.\u201d <em>Reagan Bush Comm. v.
