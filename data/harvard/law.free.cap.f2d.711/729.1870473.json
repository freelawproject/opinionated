Concluding that Howard was a \u201cresponsible person\u201d who, without reasonable cause, willfully failed to collect and pay over these taxes, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-15\">FACTS:</p>\n<p id=\"b815-16\">Eden Marketing Corporation [Eden] was a Texas corporation engaged in the sale of skin care products to various control centers throughout the United States. It was incorporated on May 12,1978, did business for a short while, and is currently without assets.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-19\">Appellant Howard was a director, minority shareholder, Treasurer, and Executive Vice-President of Eden from April 13, 1978 to September 12, 1978, when he resigned. Howard was responsible for Eden\u2019s day-today operations. Although Mr. Paul Jennings, CEO and majority shareholder, had final responsibility for hiring and firing, Howard hired and fired a number of employees with Jennings\u2019 approval during this period.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-20\">At the start of his tenure at Eden, Howard himself determined on several occasions which of Eden\u2019s bills were to be paid. In May of 1978 Howard caused $8,000 in back taxes to be paid the IRS. The IRS credited this money to the liability of one of Jennings\u2019 predecessor partnerships, with which Howard had no connection. Jennings became extremely upset when he learned of Howard\u2019s action, and ordered Howard not to pay the IRS any more money. Jennings subsequently relieved Howard of his duties with Eden for several weeks.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-21\">Upon being reinstated, Howard was instructed by Jennings not to pay any more bills without Jennings\u2019 approval. Although Jennings generally told Howard which creditors he should pay and when, Howard did issue small checks without Jennings\u2019 approval on a number of occasions.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-22\">From May 12, 1978 to July 6, 1978, Howard was the only authorized signatory on Eden\u2019s main checking account, and wrote most of the company\u2019s checks. From July 6, 1978 until September 7, 1978, Howard and Comptroller Richard Jameson, an employee working under Howard\u2019s supervision, were the only authorized signatories on this account. The bank required only one signature on checks drawn on this account.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-23\">Eden incurred employment tax liability for the second, third and fourth quarters of 1978 in the amount of $30,388.53. These taxes included federal income taxes with<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"732\">*732</page-number>held from employees, the employee portion of FICA (Social Security) taxes withheld from Eden\u2019s employees, and the employer portion of FICA taxes. Howard was aware that taxes were due and owing to the IRS, at least in some amount, as early as June 1978. At some point during the summer of 1978, Howard contacted a senior IRS official who was also a deacon at his church and asked what he should do about Eden\u2019s unpaid taxes. Howard testified at his deposition that the official suggested that he write' a letter to the IRS explaining the situation. Howard did not write the letter right away. He continued fulfilling his duties at Eden throughout the summer, writing at least 36 checks to creditors other than the IRS during that period. Howard officially resigned from Eden on September 12,1978. In his letter of resignation, Howard advised Jennings of his concern over Eden\u2019s unpaid taxes.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> By letter dated September 20, 1978, Howard advised the local District Director of the IRS that Eden owed somewhat in excess of $30,000 in back taxes.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Howard did not mention in this letter either his conversation with the senior IRS official, or Jennings\u2019 instructions that he pay no further taxes to the IRS without Jennings\u2019 approval.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-11\">At the time Howard wrote this letter, Eden still had a substantial amount of money on deposit at its bank, as well as substantial assets in the form of inventories and accounts receivable. The IRS did not move to collect the taxes Eden owed until over two years later. By that point, Eden was without assets.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-12\">The IRS then issued assessments in the amount of the unpaid taxes under section 6672(a) of the Internal Revenue Code<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"733\">*733</page-number>against both Howard and Jennings. Howard was assessed $22,671.76, representing all of Eden\u2019s unpaid federal and FICA employees\u2019 withholding taxes for the second and third quarters of 1978. Howard paid a small portion of this assessment and instituted suit for a refund. The IRS counterclaimed for the unpaid balance of the assessment, and attempted to bring Jennings into the suit as an additional defendant on the counterclaim. Unfortunately, the IRS was unable to effect personal service on Jennings. The district court granted the IRS\u2019 motion for summary judgment based on the undisputed facts set forth above. The court determined that: (1) Howard was a person responsible for the collection and payment of taxes under sections 6671(b) and 6672(a); (2) Howard willfully failed to pay over the taxes owed; and (3) Howard lacked a saving \u201creasonable cause\u201d for his willful failure to pay these taxes. Howard appeals that decision to this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"AZF\">ANALYSIS:</p>\n<p id=\"b817-5\">Under Rule 56 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, summary judgment is appropriate where \u201cthe pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c). In considering whether to grant a motion for summary judgment, the court must view the evidence in the light most favorable to the party opposing the motion. <em>Trevino v. Celanese Corp., </em>701 F.2d 397, 407 (5th Cir. 1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b817-6\">Sections 3102 and 3402 of the Internal Revenue Code require employers to withhold federal income tax and social security taxes from their employees\u2019 wages. The money withheld constitutes a special fund held in trust for the United States. I.R.C. \u00a7 7501 (1977). Each employee is credited by the Government with the taxes withheld from his wages, even if they are never remitted to the Government. <em>Mazo v. United States, </em>591 F.2d 1151, 1153 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>444 U.S. 842, 100 S.Ct. 82, 62 L.Ed.2d 54 (1979). When a corporate employer neglects to pay the required taxes, section 6672(a) authorizes the Government to assess the full amount of taxes due against the corporation\u2019s responsible officers in the form of a penalty. <em>Slodov v. United States, </em>436 U.S. 238, 98 S.Ct. 1778, 1783, 56 L.Ed.2d 251 (1978); <em>Moore v. United States, </em>465 F.2d 514, 517 (5th Cir.1972), <em>cert. denied, </em>409 U.S. 1108, 93 S.Ct. 907, 34 L.Ed.2d 688 (1973). This penalty is distinct from and in addition to the employer\u2019s liability for these taxes. <em>Newsome v. United States, </em>431 F.2d 742, 745 (5th Cir.1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b817-11\">Before it may assess the penalty under section 6672(a) for employees\u2019 unpaid federal income and FICA taxes, the IRS must show that the person assessed was a person responsible for the payment of those taxes who, without reasonable cause, willfully failed to collect, account for or pay over the taxes to the IRS. <em>See </em>note 3, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b817-12\">\n<em>Responsible Person</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b817-13\">The district court found that Howard was responsible for the collection and payment of taxes under I.R.C. sections 6671(b) and 6672(a). Howard argues that he was not a \u201cresponsible person\u201d under these two statutes because: (1) he was not the majority shareholder in Eden; (2) CEO Paul Jennings, who had ultimate control over all payments by Eden to private creditors and to the IRS, ordered him not to pay any taxes; and (3) the IRS did not seek to impose the section 6672(a) penalty on Rick <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"734\">*734</page-number>Jameson, one of Howard\u2019s subordinates who, like Howard, was authorized to write checks on Eden\u2019s main checking account.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-4\">Howard\u2019s arguments are without merit. The fact that he was a minority shareholder is itself legally insufficient to establish that he was not a \u201cresponsible person,\u201d and is relevant only to the extent that it supports his second argument, that he was merely following Paul Jennings\u2019 orders in refusing to pay the taxes owed.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-5\">Responsibility in this context is a matter of status, duty and authority. Mazo, 591 F.2d at 1156. Howard was a director, minority shareholder, Treasurer and Executive Vice-President of Eden during the second and third quarters of 1978. He ran Eden\u2019s day-to-day operations. He was the sole signatory on the corporation\u2019s main checking account for a substantial portion of that period, and shared check-signing authority with Rick Jameson for the remainder of the relevant period. During a prior quarter, it was he who directed that $8,000 in back taxes be paid the IRS. <em>See Brown v. United States, </em>464 F.2d 590, 591 (5th Cir.1972) (\u201cresponsible person\u201d was person successful in securing payment of withholding taxes during prior quarter), <em>cert. denied, </em>410 U.S. 908, 93 S.Ct. 962, 35 L.Ed.2d 270 (1973). Howard\u2019s duties, prerogatives, and prior acts are more than sufficient to establish that he was a \u201cresponsible person\u201d for the purpose of section 6672(a) liability. <em>Commonwealth National Bank of Dallas v. United States, </em>665 F.2d 743, 755 (5th Cir.1982) (lending bank officer with power to see that corporate borrower\u2019s taxes were paid, and to make decisions as to disbursement of funds, was a \u201cresponsible person\u201d); <em>Mazo, </em>591 F.2d at 1155-56 (general manager in charge of corporation\u2019s day-to-day operations and possessing check-signing authority was a \u201cresponsible person\u201d); <em>Hornsby v. IRS, </em>588 F.2d 952, 953 (5th Cir.1979) (corporate officer with check-signing authority was a \u201cresponsible person\u201d); <em>Neckles v. United States, </em>579 F.2d 938, 940 (5th Cir.1978) (de <em>facto </em>corporate officer regarded by some as a \u201cboss,\u201d who signed checks and had significant control over disbursement of corporate funds, was a \u201cresponsible person\u201d); <em>Adams v. United States, </em>504 F.2d 73, 75 (7th Cir.1974) (\u201cresponsible person\u201d need not be a corporate officer, but only someone with significant control over the disbursement of funds); <em>Liddon </em>v. <em>United States, </em>448 F.2d 509, 513 (5th Cir.1971) (50% shareholder and corporate agent with authority to sign checks was a \u201cresponsible person\u201d), <em>cert. denied, </em>406 U.S. 918, 92 S.Ct. 1769, 32 L.Ed.2d 117 (1972); <em>Monday </em>v. <em>United States, </em>421 F.2d 1210, 1214-15 (9th Cir.1970) (\u201cresponsible person\u201d status generally attaches to \u201chigh corporate officials charged with general control over corporate business affairs who participate in decisions concerning payment of creditors and disbursement of funds.\u201d), <em>cert. denied, </em>400 U.S. 821, 91 S.Ct. 38, 27 L.Ed.2d 48 (1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b818-10\">The fact that Jennings might well have fired Howard had he disobeyed Jennings\u2019 instructions and paid the taxes does not make Howard any less responsible for their payment. <em>See Brown, </em>464 F.2d at 591 n. 1 (5th Cir.1972) (\u201cresponsible person\u201d need not have final word on payment of bills and taxes). Howard had the status, duty and authority to pay the taxes owed, and would only have lost that authority after he had paid them. Authority to pay in this context means <em>effective power </em>to pay. That Howard had this authority is demonstrated by the fact that he did issue small checks without Jennings\u2019 approval on a number of occasions. <em>Commonwealth National Bank, </em>665 F.2d at 752. Had Jennings fired Howard for paying the taxes, Howard would at least have fulfilled his legal obligations.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Faced with the possibility of leaving the frying pan with only minor burns, Howard chose instead to stay on in the vain hope of avoiding the fire. While we appreciate the difficulty of his position, we cannot condone his abdication of the responsibility imposed upon him by law. <em>See Moore, </em>465 F.2d at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"735\">*735</page-number>517 (corporate officers who merely followed their superior\u2019s instructions in issuing checks to creditors were nevertheless \u201cresponsible persons\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b819-4\">Finally, Howard seeks to escape liability by analogizing his situation to that of Jameson. Jameson shared check-signing authority with Howard. The IRS did not assess the 6672(a) penalty against Jameson. Howard argues that the IRS\u2019 failure to pursue Jameson can only be explained by the proposition that Jameson was not a \u201cresponsible person,\u201d because Jennings had the last word in determining which of Eden\u2019s bills and taxes should be paid. Howard infers from this that he is not a \u201cresponsible person\u201d either.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-5\">It does not follow from the fact that the IRS failed to assess the penalty against Jameson that he was not a \u201cresponsible person.\u201d The IRS is not obligated to pursue every person with responsibility for paying taxes of this sort, and did not abuse its discretion in assessing the penalty against Howard, and not Jameson. <em>Hornsby, </em>588 F.2d at 954. The fact that there may be other fiscally \u201cresponsible persons\u201d does not relieve Howard of his duty to pay these taxes as a \u201cresponsible person.\u201d Id<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>Willful Failure</em></p>\n<p id=\"b819-6\">Howard argues that because he was obeying Jennings\u2019 orders in not paying the taxes, his action cannot be characterized as \u201cwillful.\u201d In <em>Mazo </em>we stated that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b819-7\">The issue of willfulness is necessarily directed to the state of the responsible person\u2019s mind, a subjective determination. This determination is usually factual, and <em>\u201cif sufficiently controverted, would preclude the granting of a summary judgment </em>on penalty liability,\u201d <em>Teel v. United States </em>[529 F.2d 903, 905 (9th Cir.1976) ]. However, as the court held in <em>Teel, supra, </em>evidence that the responsible person had knowledge of payments to other creditors after he was aware of the failure to pay withholding tax is sufficient for summary judgment on the question of willfulness. <em>See also Kalb v. United States </em>[505 F.2d 506, 511 (2d Cir. 1974) ], and our decision in <em>Moore v. United States </em>[465 F.2d 514, 516 (5th Cir. 1972)], cert. denied [409 U.S. 1108, 93 S.Ct. 907, 34 L.Ed.2d 688 (1973)], sustaining the correctness of a charge to the jury that the taxpayer\u2019s conduct was willful as a matter of law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b819-10\">Mazo, 591 F.2d at 1157. It is undisputed that Howard knew he had failed to pay the taxes in question. In May of 1978 he directed that $8,000 in taxes be paid. He later contacted a senior IRS official to determine what should be done about the unpaid taxes, and notified Jennings in his letter of resignation that these taxes remained unpaid. It is also undisputed that Howard had knowledge of payments to other creditors after he was aware of the failure to pay the taxes. Howard himself signed 36 checks made out to other creditors after he knew that Eden owed taxes to the IRS. We hold that under the rule set forth in <em>Mazo, </em>Howard\u2019s conduct was willful as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-11\">Howard nonetheless argues that in order to be willful, his failure to pay the taxes had to be voluntary. Since he was only following his superior\u2019s orders, he contends that his omission was involuntary, i.e. that he was not personally at fault for the failure to pay. In <em>Slodov v. United States, </em>436 U.S. 238, 98 S.Ct. 1778, 36 L.Ed.2d 251 (1978), the Supreme Court stated that \u201c[t]he fact that [section 6672] imposes a \u2018penalty\u2019 and is violated only by a \u2018willful failure\u2019 is itself strong evidence that it was not intended to impose liability without personal fault.\u201d <em>Id. </em>98 S.Ct. at 1788. However, as we have already noted in our analysis of Howard\u2019s status as a \u201cresponsible person,\u201d Howard had a choice. He could have paid the taxes, accepted the consequences, and thus avoided the penalty. Neither his discomfort over not paying the taxes, nor his desire to see them paid, makes his failure to pay any the less willful. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"736\">*736</page-number>In the context of 6672(a), \u201cwillful\u201d means voluntary, conscious, or intentional, as opposed to accidental. <em>Garsky v. United States, </em>600 F.2d 86, 91 (7th Cir.1979). An action or omission need not be motivated by bad intent to be willful. <em>Feist v. United States, </em>607 F.2d 954, 961 &amp; n. 8 (Ct.Cl.1979); <em>Mazo, </em>591 F.2d at 1154; <em>Sorensen v. United States, </em>521 F.2d 325, 328 &amp; n. 3 (9th Cir. 1975). A considered decision not to fulfill one\u2019s obligation to pay the taxes owed, evidenced by payments made to other creditors in the knowledge that the taxes are due, is all that is required to establish willfulness. <em>Feist, </em>607 F.2d at 961; <em>Mazo, </em>591 F.2d at 1157; <em>Brown v. United States, </em>591 F.2d 1136, 1140 (5th Cir.1979); <em>Sorensen, </em>521 F.2d at 328; <em>Brown, </em>464 F.2d at 591; <em>Monday, </em>421 F.2d at 1215.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-4\">\n<em>Reasonable Cause</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b820-5\">The failure to remit taxes under section 6672(a) is not willful if the taxpayer can produce a \u201creasonable cause\u201d for this failure. <em>Newsome, </em>431 F.2d at 747. The reasonable cause exception is quite limited in scope. <em>Id. </em>Howard has cited no cases holding that the existence of an order from a superior not to pay withholding taxes constitutes reasonable cause for failure to pay them, and we have found none.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b820-6\">Howard further argues, however, that because he contacted a deacon in his church who was a senior official of the IRS, and was told to \u201cwrite a letter\u201d to the IRS explaining his problem, he had reasonable cause not to make the required payments. Howard\u2019s conversation with this official is only briefly adverted to in the record. The record does not disclose when this conversation took place, the identity of the official, or what was said except for the official\u2019s recommendation that Howard write the IRS a letter. We do not believe that a recommendation by an IRS official that a person contact the appropriate IRS office and explain his problem to them constitutes reasonable cause for not paying taxes. We also note that Howard did not write the letter in question until after he had resigned from Eden. By that point, he had voluntarily relinquished his authority to pay the tax out of corporate funds. His liability was established, and there was little anyone could have done to help him. The record contains no indication that the IRS official to whom Howard spoke ever told him that he could escape liability by writing the IRS, or that he was not under any obligation to pay the taxes owed. We conclude that, as a matter of law, Howard lacked reasonable cause for his failure to collect and pay the taxes owed.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-9\">\n<em>Other Considerations</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b820-10\">Howard contends that he would not be in the position he is in today if the IRS had promptly sought to collect the taxes owed once he notified them that they had not been paid. This is beside the point. A corporate officer cannot neglect his corporation\u2019s fiscal obligations, resign his position, and then seek to shift those obligations to the IRS. <em>Slodov, </em>98 S.Ct. at 1785. Howard\u2019s personal liability was independently established long before he notified the IRS of Eden\u2019s tax deficiency. <em>See Hornsby, </em>588 F.2d at 954 (liability imposed by section 6672(a) is distinct from corporation\u2019s duty to pay withheld taxes); <em>Newsome, </em>431 F.2d at 745. Their handling of this deficiency is legally irrelevant to the separate issue of his liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-11\">Howard also claims that because he resigned his position with Eden shortly before the end of the third quarter of 1978, he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"737\">*737</page-number>cannot be held personally liable for Eden\u2019s tax deficiency for that quarter.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-5\">Section 6672(a) imposes liability on any person \u201crequired to collect, truthfully account for, and pay over any tax.... \u201d Since he was no longer employed by Eden on the date that taxes for the third quarter were due, Howard claims that he was not a person responsible for their payment. We rejected this same argument in <em>Brown, </em>591 F.2d at 1140. Relying on the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Slodov, </em>we said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b821-6\">In <em>Slodov, </em>the Court specifically stated that an officer or employee need not be responsible for the payment of withholding taxes at the end of the quarter in order to be a responsible person for that quarter; it noted that otherwise \u201cthe penalties easily could be evaded by changes in officials\u2019 responsibilities prior to the expiration of any quarter.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b821-7\"><em>Brown, </em>591 F.2d at 1140 (citations omitted).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> We see no reason to depart from our holding in <em>Brown. See also Kalb v. United States, </em>505 F.2d 506, 509 (2d Cir.l974).(\u201cresponsible person\u201d still liable under section 6672(a) even though company went bankrupt before the end of the first quarter), <em>cert. denied, </em>421 U.S. 979, 95 S.Ct. 1981, 44 L.Ed.2d 471 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b821-8\">\n<em>Conclusion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b821-9\">Finding no disputed issues of material fact, we hold that Howard was a person responsible for the collection and payment of taxes under sections 6672(a) and 6671(b) who, without reasonable cause, willfully failed to pay these taxes.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-10\">We cannot help feeling that it is Jennings who should pay these taxes. The district court described Jennings as \u201can even more responsible person\u201d than Howard. However, Jennings is apparently no longer within reach of the long arm of the'IRS. And section 6672(a) looks only to \u201cresponsible persons,\u201d not to \u201cthe most responsible person,\u201d for satisfaction. Although we recognize that our holding today may appear harsh to some, we are bound to follow the law as interpreted by the Supreme Court and this Circuit. The judgment of the district court is accordingly</p>\n<p id=\"b821-13\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b816-4\">.

They owed heavy debts to vendors, were overdrawn at their bank, and were not making their federal payroll tax deposits.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b816-13\">In May, 1978,1 made a deposit of payroll tax in the amount of $8,000.00, in lieu of paying a payroll. Due to the heavy debts that I was faced with paying, and Eden not having any original capital, I was unable to pay any further moneys due to Internal Revenue Service. I believe that you will find that the amount still due to be something in excess of $30,000.00. I am enclosing a copy of my formal resignation along with this letter and request that this information be kept in the strictest of confidence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b816-14\">Sincerely,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b816-15\">/s/ W.

We are somewhat puzzled at this characterization, since authority is by definition normally delegated downward to subordinates. However, this novel concept was not necessary to the district court\u2019s holding that Howard lacked reasonable cause, and the court in rejecting Howard\u2019s argument properly stated the applicable rule, that \u201c[o]ne who has the status, duty and authority within a corporate structure to pay over trust fund taxes due cannot rely on the instructions of another to violate his duty.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b821-11\">.
