For the reasons discussed below, we reverse and remand this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-20\">On June 9,1980, appellant applied for SSI benefits alleging a disability due to mental retardation. After her claim was denied initially and on reconsideration, appellant appeared before an administrative law judge (ALJ); appellant was represented by a paralegal from a legal services organization. The ALJ denied benefits. The Appeals Council affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-21\">At the time of the December 19, 1980, administrative hearing, appellant was forty-one years old. She testified that although she had a seventh grade special education, she had difficulty with reading, writing and mathematics. Appellant further testified to severely restricted daily activities. She has always lived with family members and can only perform household tasks, such as cooking or grocery shopping, with the assistance of others. Appellant has no relevant work experience. In addition, appellant testified that she was nervous and uncomfortable around people.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-22\">At the request of the Secretary, a clinical psychologist, Gretchen Lee, evaluated appellant. Based on the results of a Weschler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS) examination, Ms. Lee reported that appellant had \u201cborderline intellectual functioning\u201d; appellant had a verbal scale IQ of 65, a performance scale IQ of 91, and a full scale IQ of 75. Ms. Lee believed that appellant\u2019s \u201cgreatest deficit\u201d was her lack of an attention span and lack of motivation. Ms. Lee concluded that appellant would not \u201ctolerate employment other than in a sheltered workshop setting whereby goals are short term with a great deal of opportunity for social interaction.\u201d Ms. Lee noted appellant \u201cenjoyed social interaction\u201d and \u201cloved to talk.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b181-23\">At the request of appellant\u2019s representative, psychologist Beverly Adams also evaluated appellant. Ms. Adams administered a battery of intelligence and psychological <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>tests. Ms. Adams agreed with Ms. Lee\u2019s assessment of appellant\u2019s intelligence but disagreed as to appellant\u2019s tolerance for social interaction. According to Ms. Adams, personality testing revealed that appellant was withdrawn, had \u201cdifficulty understanding and meeting expectations of social interaction,\u201d and consequently maintained an \u201cisolationist lifestyle.\u201d Ms. Adams agreed with Ms. Lee\u2019s conclusion that appellant would not tolerate employment other than in a sheltered workshop. Ms. Adams, however, believed that \u201c[u]ntil such time as [appellant] becomes comfortable in social settings, the interaction necessary in such a workshop setting would act as a deterrent to participation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b182-4\">After the hearing, the ALJ submitted a written hypothetical question to a vocational expert concerning the availability of competitive jobs in the national economy for appellant. The question assumed that appellant had borderline intelligence, limited educational skills, no past work experience, and \u201cdifficulty with social interaction.\u201d Somewhat inconsistently, the question also assumed that appellant could \u201ccommunicate and cooperate with others and exercise independent judgment.\u201d The expert responded that a number of unskilled jobs, such as an office helper or cafeteria attendant, would be available. Appellant\u2019s representative also submitted a hypothetical question to the expert. The representative\u2019s question, however, deleted the AU\u2019s reference to appellant\u2019s alleged ability to work with others and exercise judgment and included a reference to her \u201cisolationist lifestyle.\u201d The expert then responded that no jobs would be available.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-8\">The ALJ denied benefits, finding that appellant had the ability to perform substantial gainful activity, as evidenced by the vocational expert\u2019s response to the AU\u2019s hypothetical question. The ALJ noted \u201cthat is not to say that claimant ever will perform any of those jobs.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b182-9\">This court must affirm the findings of the Secretary if they are supported by substantial evidence. <em>Brand v. Secretary of Department of Health, Education and Welfare, </em>623 F.2d 523, 527 (8th Cir. 1980). In this case, there is a total lack of evidence to support the finding that appellant is capable of substantial gainful activity. To the contrary, the evidence overwhelmingly supports the conclusion that appellant is disabled.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-10\">The evidence from the psychologists is that appellant, under the most tolerant of conditions, could perhaps perform some sort of activity in a sheltered workshop. In <em>Bailey v. Califano, </em>614 F.2d 146 (8th Cir. 1980), this court rejected speculation as to a claimant\u2019s ability to engage in workshop activity as evidence of an ability to perform substantial gainful activity. We noted that the \u201cregulations do provide that in certain circumstances, <em>work </em>in a sheltered workshop may provide evidence of skills and abilities that demonstrate an ability to engage in substantial gainful activity.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 149 (emphasis in original). However, Ms. Bailey had \u201cnever worked in such a workshop and there [was] no evidence to indicate that such a workshop [was] available to her and that, if one were, her earnings in such a workshop would be attributable to her productive capabilities as distinguished from subsidies relating to her needs.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>Such is also the case here.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>In addition, we reject the Secretary\u2019s reliance on the vocational expert\u2019s response to the ALJ\u2019s hypothetical question as substantial evidence that appellant had the ability to perform a variety of unskilled jobs in a competitive work setting. A hypothetical question to a vocational expert must accurately set forth a claimant\u2019s impairments and resulting functional limitations so that the expert can realistically assess the availability of jobs. <em>Camp v. Schweiker, </em>643 F.2d 1325, 1332-33 (8th Cir.1981). Here, there is no record support for the ALJ\u2019s assumption that appellant could cooperate and communicate with others and exercise independent judgment in a competitive work setting. Appellant\u2019s testimony of her daily activities, which the ALJ expressly found credible, supports Ms. Adams\u2019 conclusion that appellant was withdrawn and isolated from others. Even assuming record support (which we find lacking) for Ms. Lee\u2019s comment that appellant \u201cenjoyed social interaction\u201d and \u201cloved to talk,\u201d that comment is hardly evidence of appellant\u2019s ability to interact with others in a competitive work setting.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-5\">Accordingly, the judgment is reversed and the case is remanded to the district court with directions to remand the claim to the Secretary to award appellant SSI benefits.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b182-5\">. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.973(c) (1983) (formerly codified at 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.932(e) (1980)) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b182-6\">(c) <em>If your work is done under special conditions. </em>Even though the work you are doing takes into account your impairment, such as work done in a sheltered workshop or as a patient in a hospital, it may still show that you have the necessary skills and ability to work at the substantial gainful activity level.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b182-7\">. <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 416.974(2), (3) (1983) (formerly codified at 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.934(a) (1980)) provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b182-11\">(2) <em>We consider only the amounts you earn. </em>We do not consider any income not directly related to your productivity when we decide whether you have done substantial gainful activity. If your earnings are being subsidized, the amount of the subsidy is not counted when we determine whether or not your work is substantial gainful activity. Thus, where work is done under special conditions, we only consider the part of your pay which you actually \u201cearn\u201d. For example, where a handicapped person does simple <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>tasks under close and continuous supervision, we would not determine that the person worked at the substantial activity level only on the basis of the amount of pay. An employer may set a specific amount as a subsidy after figuring the reasonable value of the employee\u2019s services. If your work is subsidized and your employer does not set the amount of the subsidy or does not adequately explain how the subsidy was figured, we will investigate to see how much your work is worth.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b183-8\">(3) <em>If you are working in a sheltered or special environment. </em>If you are working in a sheltered workshop, you may or may not be earning the amounts you are being paid.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b183-9\">. The ALJ also erred in failing to evaluate appellant\u2019s impairment under the Listing of Impairments. 20 C.F.R., Part 404, Subpart P, App. 1 (1983) (formerly codified at 20 C.F.R., Part 416, Subpart I, App. 1 (1980)). Section 12.05C provides that a finding of disability due to mental retardation is required if a claimant has an \u201cIQ of 60 to 69 inclusive ... and [another] mental impairment imposing additional and significant work-related limitation of function.\u201d Section 12.00B4 requires that a standardized IQ test, such as the WAIS, be administered, and that if the test yields more than one IQ score, the lowest score must be used. In our view, appellant\u2019s impairment meets the criteria of the Listing. As discussed in the text, appellant\u2019s lowest WAIS score was a verbal IQ of 65 and the evidence is that appellant has additional mental impairments that significantly limit her ability to work.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
