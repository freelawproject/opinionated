Carey, </em>447 U.S. 54, 65, 100 S.Ct. 2024, 2031, 64 L.Ed.2d 723 (1980), gives rise to a claim under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e, the New York Human Rights Law, or 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 as a violation of due process, see <em>Logan v. Zimmerman Brush Co., </em>455 U.S. 422, 102 S.Ct. 1148, 71 L.Ed.2d 265 (1982). We hold that it does not.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-13\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b590-14\">On or about March 3, 1975, appellant Andrew Polk, a black male, filed a discrimination complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), alleging that he had been terminated from his position with the New York City Transit Authority because of his race. Shortly thereafter, the EEOC informed Polk that Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 required that he first file his discrimination complaint with the New York State Division of Human Rights (Division). Polk duly filed a complaint with the Division on March 17, 1975. On August 15, 1975, the Division found that there was probable cause to believe the appellant\u2019s allegations of discrimination, and accordingly recommended that the case proceed to a public hearing pursuant to \u00a7 297.4.a of the New York Human Rights Law, N.Y.Exec.Law \u00a7\u00a7 290-301 (McKinney 1982). Despite this finding and recommendation, no hearing was in fact scheduled and the Division took no timely action to settle Polk\u2019s complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-15\">On January 16, 1976, appellee Kramar-sky, Commissioner of the Division, on his own motion, vacated the determination of probable cause after finding that it was not supported by sufficient evidence; he ordered further investigation of the complaint. On June 17, 1977, more than two years after the complaint was first filed, the Division again issued a determination of probable cause and recommended a public <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>hearing. Nevertheless, the hearing was not commenced before an administrative law judge (ALJ) until March 6, 1978. It was continued on April 20, 1978, June 21, 1978, and was eventually concluded on September 15, 1978.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-5\">On January 25, 1980, almost five years after the complaint was filed, the ALJ issued findings of fact, as well as a decision and order holding that the appellant\u2019s termination was an unlawful discriminatory practice under the New York Human Rights Law. But on April 25, 1980, appel-lee Kramarsky, again acting pursuant to his own motion, returned the matter to the ALJ for additional proceedings on the ground that there was insufficient evidence to support the decision. On May 13, 1980, the ALJ ordered the matter reopened to hear more evidence. Another hearing was scheduled for June 27, 1980.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-6\">In early June 1980, before the commencement of the second public hearing, the New York City Transit Authority filed suit in New York State Supreme Court, pursuant to Article 78, N.Y.Civ.Prac.Law \u00a7 7801-06 (McKinney 1981), seeking to prevent the Division from holding further proceedings on appellant\u2019s complaint on the ground that the passage of time had prejudiced its ability to defend the suit. On January 12,1981, the Court granted the Transit Authority\u2019s application and ordered the Division to cease and desist from any further proceedings in the matter. Neither the Division nor Polk appealed this order, and on May 14, 1981, the Division issued an order closing the appellant\u2019s case and dismissing his complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-7\">Polk immediately appealed the dismissal of the complaint to the New York State Human Rights Appeal Board, an entity separate from the New York State Division of Human Rights, <em>see </em>N.Y.Exec.Law \u00a7 297-a. On June 29,1982, the Appeal Board vacated the order closing the case on the basis that the Commissioner erred in concluding that the Article 78 proceeding mandated dismissal. The Appeal Board ruled that the order required only that the Commissioner make a decision on the merits without further evidentiary proceedings. Upon remand from the Appeal Board, the Commission on July 20,1982, dismissed Polk\u2019s complaint on the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-12\">Under the procedural provisions of the Human Rights Law then in effect, Polk\u2019s complaint should have proceeded to a public hearing within sixty days after filing \u201cunless the division ... dismissed the complaint or issued an order stating the terms of a conciliation agreement not objected to by the complainant.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> A determination pursuant to the hearing should have been made within twenty days of the commencement of the hearing,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> or, in other words, within eighty days after the complaint was filed. Even allowing for Commissioner Kramarsky\u2019s decisions to set aside the probable cause finding and to remand the complaint for further proceedings, it is clear that the more than seven-year period between the filing of the complaint on March 14, 1975, and its ultimate dismissal in July of 1982 violated both the spirit and the letter of the procedural provisions cited above. At no time was Polk \u2014 who was proceeding pro se for most of this period\u2014 informed by the Division that it could not or would not comply with the State\u2019s own time requirements. Nor was Polk informed of the interrelationship between the remedies and procedures under New York and federal law. Polk eventually received an EEOC right to sue letter and his Title VII suit is now pending in federal court.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-13\">Assisted by counsel, Polk filed an action in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York on April 30, 1982, against the Division and Commissioner Kramarsky, alleging that the Division\u2019s failure to process his complaint in a timely fashion violated the New York Human Rights Law, and Title VII, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e, and his due process rights under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>the Fourteenth Amendment. He claimed that the delay in processing his complaint substantially prejudiced the preparation and prosecution of his discrimination action and caused him financial as well as emotional injury. He requested injunctive relief, a declaratory judgment, and monetary damages. Thomas P. Griesa, Judge, dismissed the complaint, holding that Title VII created no right of action against the Division. Polk\u2019s constitutional claim was rejected on the ground that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AYU\">the \u201cprocess\u201d available to plaintiff for pursuit of his discrimination claim must be taken to include the full remedial scheme, including the availability of the federal EEOC and the federal court. It is clear that adequate procedures were and are afforded to plaintiff.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b592-4\">What has been said disposes of plaintiff\u2019s claim under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b592-5\">The Court did not discuss <em>Logan v. Zimmerman Brush Co.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b592-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b592-7\">By giving state and local anti-discrimination agencies the first opportunity to hear and resolve claims of discrimination in employment, while at the same time permitting recourse to the federal agency and the federal courts \u201conly when the State does not provide <em>prompt </em>or complete relief,\u201d <em>New York Gaslight Club, Inc. v. Carey, </em>447 U.S. 54, 65,100 S.Ct. 2024, 2031, 64 L.Ed.2d 723 (1980) (emphasis added), Congress recognized, at least implicitly, that state or local procedures might be inadequate or dilatory in their operation. With this recognition in mind, the Equal Employment Opportunity Act may be searched in vain to find provisions that imply a claim for relief for such dilatoriness. While <em>Owens v. Haas, </em>601 F.2d 1242,1247-51 (2d Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>444 U.S. 980, 100 S.Ct. 483, 62 L.Ed.2d 407 (1979) (prison inmate\u2019s claim as third-party beneficiary of federal/state contract is colorable), would suggest that appellant may have some rights by virtue of the EEOC contract with the State Division, <em>see </em>Amicus Brief of EEOC at 15-16; <em>New York Gaslight Club, Inc. v. Carey, </em>447 U.S. 54, 100 S.Ct. 2024, 64 L.Ed.2d 723 (1980); <em>see also </em>Block, <em>Enforcement of Title VI Compliance Agreements by Third Party Beneficiaries, </em>18 Harv.C.R.-C.L.L.Rev. 1 (1983), this claim was not made below and is therefore not available on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-9\">Similarly, the New York Human Rights Law does not provide any remedy against the Division. The New York Court of Appeals has held that the Human Rights Law time periods are directory in nature, not mandatory. <em>Sarkisian Brothers, Inc. v. State Division of Human Rights, </em>48 N.Y.2d 816, 818, 399 N.E.2d 1146, 1147, 424 N.Y.S.2d 125, 126 (1979). This decision is of course binding on us. <em>O\u2019Brien v. Skinner, </em>414 U.S. 524, 531, 94 S.Ct. 740, 743, 38 L.Ed.2d 702 (1974); <em>Mrazek v. Suffolk County Board of Elections, </em>630 F.2d 890, 899 (2d Cir.1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b592-10\">Polk\u2019s principal argument on appeal is that, under <em>Logan v. Zimmerman Brush Co., </em>the time provisions established by the New York Human Rights Law amount to a property interest or entitlement independently protected by the due process clause. In <em>Logan </em>the Court addressed a situation where state law completely deprived a claimant of an opportunity to pursue a discrimination claim because the state agency failed to convene a factfinding conference within the statutorily specified period of 120 days. The Illinois Supreme Court held that compliance with the time limit was mandatory, and that noncompliance stripped the state agency of jurisdiction. The Supreme Court reversed, holding that the \u201cright to use the [state\u2019s] adjudicatory procedures,\u201d 455 U.S. at 431, 102 S.Ct. at 1155, was a form of property and that the 120-day limit that the state supreme court found dispositive was violative of due process because it \u201cfinally destroyed] a property interest without first giving the putative owner an opportunity to present his claim of entitlement.\u201d 455 U.S. at 434, 102 S.Ct. at 1157 (footnote omitted). <em>Logan </em>thus stands for the proposition that if the state creates a statutory entitlement, due process concerns require that the entitlement not be destroyed without some opportunity for a hearing. But here Polk\u2019s Title VII suit\u2014 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>filed shortly after this action was filed \u2014 is currently pending.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> He also did not appeal the Human Rights Appeals Board\u2019s final order dismissing his state complaint. He therefore cannot claim that the delay here in fact deprived him of a favorable disposition of his claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-5\">The argument Polk is making \u2014 that procedural provisions are per se property interests and that by their very nature they establish what procedure is due \u2014 was not considered in <em>Logan. </em>Instead, the Court engaged in the familiar two-step analysis, 455 U.S. at 428, 102 S.Ct. at 1153, which asks, first, whether there is a property or liberty interest and, second, if there is, what process is due. The property right or entitlement found in <em>Logan </em>was not a right to a hearing within 120 days \u2014 the Court termed this \u201ca procedural limitation on the claimant\u2019s ability to assert his rights, not a substantive element of the ... claim,\u201d <em>id </em>at 433, 102 S.Ct. at 1156 \u2014 but instead a right of action under the state statute involved, <em>id </em>at 428-29, 102 S.Ct. at 1153\u2014 1154, which the procedural limitation destroyed. Here, Polk\u2019s right of action has survived, albeit long delayed. <em>Logan </em>is therefore distinguishable. As the <em>Logan </em>Court opined: \u201cTo put it as plainly as possible, the State may not <em>finally destroy </em>a property interest without first giving the putative owner an opportunity to present his claim of entitlement.\u201d 455 U.S. at 434, 102 S.Ct. at 1156 (emphasis added) (footnote omitted).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b593-6\">Our conclusion is reinforced by the practical aspects of the case. What relief would be appropriate were Polk to prevail? He cannot be given a timely hearing. His claim that he was \u201cprejudiced\u201d by the delay is an assertion only; whether he was will await the outcome of the Title VII case. It may be that the Transit Authority is the party that was \u201cprejudiced\u201d; it sufficiently thought it was to bring Article 78 proceedings seeking dismissal. Or it may be that neither party was prejudiced or, more likely, that both were. To be sure, a declaration that the Division should have acted more promptly might do someone some good in the future. It is, however, obvious from the statement of the case that the Division did not do its job. That being said, what is to be gained by saying anything further? As for monetary damages, that question is not reached if there is no violation of due process rights, procedural or otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-10\">Judgment affirmed, without costs or attorneys\u2019 fees to either party.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b591-8\">.

We note that the New York City Transit Authority, the defendant in that action, has asserted a laches defense in its Answer and moved to dismiss the Complaint and/or for summary judgment, pursuant to Rules 12(b)(1), (b)(6), and 56(b) on the basis that, inter alia, the Title VII claim is barred by laches. Judge Conner, before whom the Title VII action is pending, has not yet ruled on the laches issue. We cannot address in this action the question whether, under the circumstances presented herein, dismissal of that action on the basis of laches would be in derogation of Polk\u2019s constitutional right to due process.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b593-19\">.
