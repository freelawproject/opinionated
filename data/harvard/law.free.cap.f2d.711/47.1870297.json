Because the case is controlled by our decision in <em>Clark v. DeLaval Separator Corp., </em>639 F.2d 1320 (5th Cir. 1981), we affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-9\">In February 1978, a staple from a staple gun manufactured by Duo-Fast struck Carol Garvie in the eye during the course of her employment.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> She filed this suit on January 15, 1982, alleging that the staple gun was inherently dangerous, hence defective, and that it was not fit for its intended purpose. One claim sounded in tort, the other in contract, alleging that Duo-Fast breached an implied warranty.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-10\">Duo-Fast filed a motion for summary judgment in June 1982, asserting that both of Garvie\u2019s causes of action were barred by the running of the statute of limitations. The district judge granted the motion. He concluded that the tort claim was barred by Texas\u2019 two-year statute of limitations.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> He held that the breach of warranty claim was barred by the four-year statute of limitations <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> because Garvie\u2019s cause of action had accrued at the time her employer bought the staple gun from Duo-Fast. Garvie appeals only the dismissal of the latter claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-20\">In <em>Garcia v. Texas Instruments, Inc., </em>610 S.W.2d 456 (Tex.1980), the Texas Supreme Court held that the Texas UCC warranty provisions establish a cause of action for personal injuries and that such actions are governed by the four-year limitations provision of UCC article 2.725.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>Garcia </em>did not make clear, however, when the cause of action for such a breach accrues.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b132-22\">In <em>Clark, </em>we held that such an action accrues \u201con the date of tender of delivery.\u201d 639 F.2d at 1325.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> That case involved a milking machine that allegedly caused an outbreak of mastitis in the plaintiff\u2019s herd of cattle. We held that the plaintiff\u2019s damage action, filed in 1977, was barred by article 2.725 insofar as it sought to rely on a breach of warranty regarding machines the plaintiff bought in 1973. <em>Clark </em>did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>involve personal injuries, but its holding is indistinguishable from this case.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b133-5\">The judgment of the district court is, therefore, AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b132-12\">.

RUBIN,</author>\n<p id=\"A0g\">Circuit Judge, specially concurring:</p>\n<p id=\"b133-7\">I concur in the court\u2019s judgment because we are bound by the decision in <em>Clark v. DeLaval Separator Corp., </em>639 F.2d 1320 (5th Cir.1981). Although I was a member of the panel that decided <em>Clark, </em>I write separately to state that, on further reflection, the result in that case seems unjust: a plaintiff\u2019s cause of action may have accrued and been extinguished before the plaintiff is injured.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-8\">A number of Texas cases hold that, when a written contract is involved, the period of limitations commences to run when the buyer discovers or should have discovered the injury. <em>See Tim Walter Homes, Inc. v. Castillo, </em>616 S.W.2d 630, 633 (Tex.Civ.App. 1981) (quoting <em>Richman v. Watel, </em>565 S.W.2d 101, 102 (Tex.Civ.App.1978)). This rule has repeatedly been followed in cases involving defects in homes which did not become apparent for some time after the sale from contractor to original purchaser. <em>E.g., Gibson v. John D. Campbell &amp; Co., </em>624 S.W.2d 728 (Tex.Civ.App.1981); <em>Vaughn Building Corp. v. Austin Co., </em>620 S.W.2d 678 (Tex.Civ.App.1981) (\u201cThe rule is well established in Texas that a cause of action for breach of implied warranty does not arise until the buyer discovers or should have discovered the injury\u201d) (three citations omitted); <em>Conann Constructors, Inc. v. Muller, </em>618 S.W.2d 564 (Tex.Civ.App.1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b133-9\"><em>Garcia, </em>as the court notes, did not make clear when the cause of action accrues. In <em>Cleveland v. Square-D Co., </em>613 S.W.2d 790, 791 (Tex.Civ.App.1981), the court permitted a suit in a personal injury case much like this one: \u201cSuit was filed more than two but less than four years <em>after the injury.\u201d </em>(emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"AUA\">Until the Texas courts definitely resolve this question, we are bound to follow <em>Clark.</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>I, therefore, respectfully concur in the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-12\">PUTNAM, District Judge, concurs in these views.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b133-11\">. <em>See Chemetron Corp. v.
