FLPMA authorizes the Secretary of the Department of the Interior to recover \u201creasonable costs\u201d of processing applications for rights-of-way. FLPMA \u00a7\u00a7 304, 310, 504(c), (g), 43 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1734, 1740, 1764(c), (g).</p>\n<p id=\"b999-24\">Three district courts, in cases involving almost identical issues of fact and law, reached differing results on the central issue we must resolve here: whether the Secretary adequately considered the \u201creasonableness factors\u201d listed in section 304(b) (hereinafter reasonableness factors or 304(b) factors) in assessing \u201creasonable costs\u201d of processing to applicants for rights-of-way across the public lands. In <em>Nevada Power Co. v. Watt, </em>No. 81-1944, and <em>Public Service Co. v. Watt (PSC II), </em>Nos. 81-2066 and 81-2143, district courts in Utah and Colorado, respectively, held that the Secretary must consider the 304(b) factors, and that he had failed to do so adequately. The Secretary appeals in both cases, and the appellees in <em>PSC II </em>raise additional issues <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"916\">*916</page-number>on cross-appeal. In <em>Colorado-Ute Electric Ass\u2019n v. Watt, </em>No. 82-1304, another judge in the District of Colorado held that the Secretary was not required by law to consider the factors, and Colorado-Ute appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b1000-4\">These appeals raise a number of fairly straightforward legal issues. Where possible, common issues will be discussed collectively. Significantly different factual and legal issues will be discussed individually.</p>\n<p id=\"b1000-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1000-6\">HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b1000-7\">A. <em>Interior\u2019s Cost Reimbursement Regulations</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1000-8\">1. The Independent Offices Appropriation Act and the Public Land Administration Act</p>\n<p id=\"b1000-9\">Although our opinion primarily addresses Interior\u2019s cost-reimbursement practices under FLPMA, we must also consider cost-reimbursement under two earlier acts, the Independent Offices Appropriation Act (IOAA), 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 483a (1976), and the Public Land Administration Act (PLAA), 43 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1371,1374 (repealed 90 Stat. 2792 (1976)). Interior\u2019s FLPMA cost-reimbursement regulations had their genesis in regulations developed under the two earlier acts. The validity of the earlier regulations is raised for our examination in <em>Colorado-Ute. </em>We therefore discuss the development of the regulations under the earlier acts in order to provide the historical context for the FLPMA regulations and to facilitate our review of <em>Colorado-Ute.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1000-10\">At all times pertinent to this appeal, federal policy has required persons seeking special permits to use the public lands to reimburse the government for costs incurred in processing their applications. Interior initially promulgated the cost reimbursement regulations here at issue in 1975, citing as authority, inter alia, Title Y of the IOAA, 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 483a and sections 201 and 204 of the PLAA, 43 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1371, 1374. 40 Fed.Reg. 17,841 (April 23, 1975); <em>see </em>43 C.F.R. \u00a7 2802.1-2 (1975). The regulations provided that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1000-13\">\u201cAn applicant for a right-of-way or a permit incident to a right-of-way shall reimburse the United States for administrative and other costs incurred by the United States in processing the application, including the preparation of reports and statements pursuant to the National Environmental Policy Act (42 U.S.C. 4321-4347), before the right-of-way or permit will be issued .... \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1000-14\"><em>Id. </em>\u00a7 2802.1-2(a)(1).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1000-15\">In January 1976, six western utility companies filed suit challenging the reimbursement regulations. The utilities sought declaratory and injunctive relief against application of the regulations on the grounds that the regulations exceeded the Secretary\u2019s statutory authority, and alternatively, that if the regulations were authorized, the statutes represented an unconstitutional delegation by Congress of the tax power. In <em>Public Service Co. </em>v. <em>Andrus, </em>433 F.Supp. 144 (D.Colo.1977) <em>(PSC I), </em>Judge Finesilver held that the IOAA and PLAA authorized Interior to recover costs only for services providing \u201cspecial benefits to [applicants] beyond those which accrue to the public at large.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 155. The judge found that environmental assessments and impact statements triggered by an application for a right-of-way were of general benefit to the public. <em>Id. </em>at 152-53. Because those studies did not \u201cprovide special benefits to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"917\">*917</page-number>[applicants] beyond those which accrue to the public at large,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 156, he held that their costs could not be charged to applicants. He enjoined Interior from enforcing the regulations \u201cto the extent that they exceed the authority provided by\u201d the PLAA and the IOAA. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1001-4\">FLPMA became effective in October 1976. During the proceedings in <em>PSC I, </em>the plaintiffs moved to amend their complaint to challenge the regulations under FLPMA as well as the IOAA and the PLAA. The trial court denied the motion \u201c[b]ecause the Secretary of the Interior has not yet interpreted the FLPMA nor, to [the court\u2019s] knowledge, issued regulations under it.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 147 n. 2. Interior dismissed its appeal of <em>PSC I </em>on November 22, 1977, assertedly because FLPMA provided express new authority for cost reimbursement.</p>\n<p id=\"b1001-5\">2. The Federal Land Policy and Management Act</p>\n<p id=\"b1001-6\">FLPMA directs Interior to promulgate rules and regulations to carry out the purposes of the Act.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> FLPMA \u00a7 310,43 U.S.C. \u00a7 1740. Prior to such rulemaking, existing rules and regulations were to continue in force to the extent practicable. <em>Id. </em>The Act specifically authorizes the Secretary to issue regulations concerning rights-of-way:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"anq-dedup-0\">\u201cThe Secretary ... may, by regulation or prior to promulgation of such regulations, as a condition of a right-of-way, require an applicant for or holder of a right-of-way to reimburse the United States for all reasonable administrative and other costs incurred in processing an application for such right-of-way and in inspection and monitoring of construction, operation, and termination of the facility pursuant to such right-of-way .... \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1001-7\"><em>Id. </em>\u00a7 504(g), 43 U.S.C. \u00a7 1764(g). Section 304 gives the Secretary more explicit authority to charge persons for applications relating to the public lands, including those for rights-of-way.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1001-10\">\u201c(a) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the Secretary may establish reasonable filing and service fees and reasonable charges, and commissions with respect to applications and other documents relating to the public lands and may change and abolish such fees, charges and commissions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1001-11\">\u201c(b) The Secretary is authorized to require a deposit of any payments intended to reimburse the United States for reasonable costs with respect to applications and other documents relating to such lands. ... As used in this section \u2018reasonable costs\u2019 include, but are not limited to, the costs of special studies; environmental impact statements; monitoring construction, operation, maintenance, and termination of any authorized facility; or other special activities. In determining whether costs are reasonable under this section, the Secretary may take into consideration actual costs (exclusive of management overhead), the monetary value of the rights or privileges sought by the applicant, the efficiency to the government processing involved, that portion of the cost incurred for the benefit of the general public interest rather than for the exclusive benefit of the applicant, the public service provided, and other factors relevant to determining the reasonableness of the costs.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1001-12\">43 U.S.C. \u00a7 1734.</p>\n<p id=\"b1001-13\">On September 29, 1977, approximately four months after <em>PSC I </em>was decided, Interior promulgated Secretarial Order No. 3011, implementing FLPMA\u2019s reimbursement provisions. The order stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1001-14\">\u201cThe regulations at 43 CFR 2802.1-2 (1976) shall be applicable to ... applications [under section 304 of FLPMA] ... until new regulations implementing Title V of FLPMA become final. <em>It is my </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"918\">*918</page-number><em>finding that \u2018reasonable costs\u2019 under Sections [sic] 304 </em>of FLPMA for processing applications for rights-of-way over public lands and for monitoring right-of-way holder activity, <em>are the actual costs incurred </em>by the United States in performing statutory responsibilities necessitated by such applications or rights-of-way. The term \u2018reasonable costs\u2019 means the same as the term \u2018administrative and other costs\u2019 as used in the regulations at 43 CFR 2802.1-2(a)(l) (1976), and includes costs incurred in preparation of environmental impact statements.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1002-4\">Secretarial Order No. 3011, 42 Fed.Reg. 55,-280 (1977) (emphasis added). Subsequently, the reimbursement regulations were reissued, 45 Fed.Reg. 44,532 (1980), with an effective date of July 31, 1980. The reissued regulations are published at 43 C.F.R. \u00a7 2803.1-1 (1982), and except for their numeration are identical to the original regulations in all respects significant to this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1002-5\">B. <em>The Lawsuits Below</em></p>\n<p id=\"afa-dedup-0\">Two of the three suits in this appeal were tried as original actions in federal district court. The third, <em>Colorado-Ute, </em>sought review of an administrative decision of the Interior Board of Land Appeals (IBLA) in addition to declaratory and injunctive relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b1002-6\">1. <em>Nevada Power Co. v. Watt</em></p>\n<p id=\"AvGy\">Nevada Power Company (Nevada Power) filed applications with the BLM for rights-of-way in Utah for the construction of the Allen-Warner Valley Electric Generation and Transmission System. The System was to supply electricity to portions of Nevada, California, and Utah. The BLM determined that the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) required the preparation of an environmental impact statement (EIS). During the processing of Nevada Power\u2019s applications, the BLM required the company to make payments under the reimbursement regulations for costs incurred, including those incurred in the preparation of the EIS. Nevada Power paid under protest.</p>\n<p id=\"b1002-10\">Nevada Power filed suit in May 1978 in the District of Utah seeking a declaratory judgment that Interior\u2019s reimbursement regulations and reimbursement program are invalid, and that the Secretary is required to consider the reasonableness factors in determining reimbursement costs. Judge Christenson granted in part Nevada Power\u2019s motion for summary judgment. He interpreted the language of section 304(b) as mandatory rather than merely permissive, and held that Interior\u2019s reimbursement regulations were not authorized by FLPMA because they do not adequately consider the section\u2019s reasonableness factors. <em>Nevada Power Co. v. Watt, </em>515 F.Supp. 307, 324 (D.Utah 1981). The judge rejected Interior\u2019s argument that the Secretary had considered the 304(b) factors, finding a \u201clack of any showing in the record that ... the factors enumerated in 304(b) were weighed at all.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 325.</p>\n<p id=\"b1002-11\">2. <em>Public Service Co. v. Watt (PSC II)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1002-12\">The plaintiffs in <em>PSC II </em>are utility companies (hereinafter referred to collectively as Public Service) that generate, transmit, and supply electric power in nine western states.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Public Service holds numerous rights-of-way over public lands and has additional applications for rights-of-way pending with the BLM. The BLM has charged Public Service for costs of processing applications, which Public Service has paid under protest. Public Service filed suit in the District of Colorado in February 1980, seeking declaratory and injunctive relief against the reimbursement regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b1002-13\">The trial court partially granted Public Service\u2019s motion for summary judgment. Judge Finesilver interpreted the language of section 304(b) as mandatory, rather than discretionary, <em>PSC II, </em>slip op. at 25, and held that the reimbursement regulations <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"919\">*919</page-number>were not authorized by FLPMA because they precluded consideration of the section\u2019s reasonableness standards, <em>id. </em>at 26. Declaring that \u201c[t]he rulemaking process is a singularly inappropriate vehicle by which to achieve compliance with FLPMA\u201d in the determination of reimbursable costs, the judge stated that at least two of the reasonableness factors, \u201cthe public service provided\u201d and \u201cthat portion of costs incurred for the benefit of the general public interest,\u201d must be considered on \u201can individual, case-by-case basis.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Additionally, Judge Fi-nesilver held that Interior was collaterally estopped by his ruling in <em>PSC I </em>to relitigate the validity of the pre-FLPMA regulations. <em>Id. </em>at 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b1003-5\">3. <em>Colorado-Ute Electric Association v. Watt</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1003-7\">Colorado-Ute is a public utility incorporated in Colorado as a cooperative association. Its thirteen members are Colorado corporations organized as cooperative associations or nonprofit corporations that retail electricity purchased from Colorado-Ute, which operates generation and transmission facilities.</p>\n<p id=\"b1003-8\">In 1973, Colorado-Ute filed a right-of-way application with the BLM for a power line. The BLM assessed Colorado-Ute processing costs under pre-FLPMA reimbursement regulations, which the corporation paid under protest.</p>\n<p id=\"b1003-9\">Colorado-Ute\u2019s right-of-way was granted in 1975, prior to FLPMA\u2019s enactment. The utility then filed a protest with the BLM seeking a refund of the costs it had been assessed. In January 1976, the BLM dismissed the protest. On administrative appeal, the IBLA affirmed in part and remanded in part, approving nearly all of the costs assessed by the BLM. <em>In re Colorado-Ute, </em>46 I.B.L.A. 35 (1980). Colorado-Ute filed this suit in the District of Colorado in April 1980, seeking review of the IBLA decision. The utility also sought declaratory and injunctive relief against the BLM\u2019s application of the reissued regulations to two applications then pending and to its envisioned future applications.</p>\n<p id=\"b1003-12\">Judge Carrigan granted Interior\u2019s motion for summary judgment, basing his opinion on an analysis of FLPMA. <em>See Colorado-Ute Electric Ass\u2019n v. Watt, </em>533 F.Supp. 197 (D.Colo.1982). The judge found that the language of section 304(b) was discretionary, and upheld the reimbursement regulations. In addition, he affirmed the IBLA decision without discussion.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1003-13\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b1003-14\">MERITS OF THE APPEAL</p>\n<p id=\"A6yR\">The principal issues before us on appeal are common to all three suits. We must first decide whether Interior\u2019s consideration of the section 304 reasonableness factors in assessing reimbursement costs is mandatory or discretionary. If mandatory, we must then decide whether the agency adequately considered those factors in promulgating the reimbursement regulations. Second, we must examine chargeable costs and determine to what extent costs of environmental impact statements and other studies triggered by right-of-way applications may be assessed to the applicants. Third, we must consider whether the reimbursement regulations can be applied to recover costs incurred prior to FLPMA\u2019s passage. Finally, in reviewing <em>Colorado-Ute, </em>we must determine the validity of the pre-FLPMA regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b1003-15\">A. <em>The Statutory Language</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1003-16\">Section 304(b) states that in determining reasonable costs for reimbursement, the Secretary \u201cmay take into consideration\u201d the several listed factors. Interior argues that consideration of the reasonableness factors is purely discretionary \u2014 that the plain <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"920\">*920</page-number>words of the statute should govern, and that \u201cmay\u201d is permissive. Interior takes the position that for right-of-way applications, \u201creasonable costs\u201d equals <em>actual </em>costs. The utilities contend that under the statute the Secretary <em>must </em>consider the reasonableness factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b1004-4\">In resolving this conflict, we \u201cmust begin with the language of the statute itself.\u201d <em>Touche Ross &amp; Co. v. Redington, </em>442 U.S. 560, 568, 99 S.Ct. 2479, 2485, 61 L.Ed.2d 82 (1979). \u201c[T]he language of the statute itself is controlling when it is sufficiently clear in context,\u201d <em>Blue Cross Ass\u2019n v. Harris, </em>664 F.2d 806, 809 (10th Cir.1981) (citing <em>Ernst &amp; Ernst </em>v. <em>Hochfelder, </em>425 U.S. 185, 201, 96 S.Ct. 1375,1384, 47 L.Ed.2d 668 (1976)), and must prevail absent a conflict with the statute\u2019s legislative history, <em>Aaron v. Securities &amp; Exchange Commission, </em>446 U.S. 680, 699-700, 100 S. Ct. 1945,1956-1957, 64 L.Ed.2d 611 (1980). <em>See, e.g., Dickerson v. New Banner Institute, Inc., </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 103 S.Ct. 986, 990, 74 L.Ed.2d 845 (1983); <em>Watt v. Alaska, </em>451 U.S. 259, 266 &amp; n. 9, 101 S.Ct. 1673, 1678 &amp; n. 9, 68 L.Ed.2d 80 (1981). We must bear in mind that when a statute is ambiguous, the interpretation given it by the agency charged with its administration is entitled to deference. <em>Udall v. Tallman, </em>380 U.S. 1, 16, 85 S.Ct. 792, 801, 13 L.Ed.2d 616 (1965); <em>Blue Cross Ass\u2019n, </em>664 F.2d at 810. However, administrative interpretations are entitled to deference, not obeisance. An administrative construction will not be adopted if a different construction is plainly required. <em>R.V. McGinnis Theatres &amp; Pay T. V., Inc. v. Video Independent Theatres, Inc., </em>386 F.2d 592, 594 (10th Cir.1967), <em>cert. denied, </em>390 U.S. 1014, 88 S.Ct. 1265, 20 L.Ed.2d 163 (1968); <em>see Zuber v. Allen, </em>396 U. S. 168, 192-93, 90 S.Ct. 314, 327-28, 24 L.Ed.2d 345 (1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b1004-10\">On first impression, Interior\u2019s argument \u2014 that \u201cmay\u201d means \u201cmay\u201d \u2014 is appealing. Under that analysis, however, the Secretary would be free to render superfluous the factors carefully set out in section 304(b). Such a result would not comport either with our reading of the statute, or with the rule that statutes must, where possible, be interpreted so as not to render any clause or provision unnecessary, contradictory, or insignificant. <em>Equal Employment Opportunity Commission v. Continental Oil Co., </em>548 F.2d 884,889 (10th Cir.1977); <em>Zeigler Coal Co. v. Kleppe, </em>536 F.2d 398,406 (D.C.Cir.1976); <em>Parker v. United States, </em>448 F.2d 793, 797 (10th Cir.1971). <em>cert. denied, </em>405 U.S. 989, 92 S.Ct. 1255, 31 L.Ed.2d 455 (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b1004-12\">\u201c \u2018May\u2019 ordinarily connotes discretion, but neither in lay nor legal understanding is this result inexorable. Rather, the conclusion to be reached \u2018depends on the context of the statute, and on whether it ... was the intention of the legislature to confer a discretionary power or to impose an imperative duty.\u2019\u201d. <em>Thompson </em>v. <em>Clifford, </em>408 F.2d 154, 158 (D.C.Cir.1968) (footnotes omitted); <em>see Farmers &amp; Merchants Bank v.

Section 304(b) is not another grant of authority, but rather appears intended by Congress to establish the outer boundaries of the blanket delegation given the Secretary elsewhere. If section 304(b) were not intended to limit Interior\u2019s ability to assess fees, it would be mere surplusage because the Secretary receives the authorization to charge fees and require reimbursement from other sections of FLPMA. In some sense, then, the section\u2019s list of reasonableness factors must act as a constraint upon the general grant of authority to charge \u201creasonable\u201d costs. We believe the section contemplates that the Secretary pay some attention to the listed factors in determining reasonable costs to be assessed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-7\">Interior suggests that the factors were listed by Congress solely to provide helpful guidelines to the department\u2019s quest to identify the elements of \u201creasonable\u201d costs.

Interior asserts that because the current regulations are substantially the same as those promulgated in 1976 under the PLAA and the 10AA, and because Secretarial Order 3011 made the earlier regulations applicable under FLPMA until new regulations were issued, \u201cthe consideration given by the Secretary to the factors listed in Section 304(b) at any point in this continuum would ... fulfill any duty he had under FLPMA to consider those factors.\u201d Interior Brief at 39, <em>Nevada Power Co. </em>However, even applying Interior\u2019s continuum theory, the validity of which we do not now decide, the consideration given the reasonableness factors by Interior was inadequate.</p>\n<p id=\"b1010-4\">Interior alleges that the preambles to the proposed and final regulations on cost reimbursement under the IOAA, PLAA, and FLPMA reflect consideration of every one of the factors listed in section 304(b). Interior also asserts that the factor \u201cthe efficiency to the government processing involved\u201d was considered, because charging actual costs eliminated the need for further appropriations to finance application processing and the delays that would thus occur. Rec., vol. III, <em>PSC II </em>at 207, \u00b6 49.a.(iii). Furthermore, Interior argues, \u201cthat portion of the costs incurred for the benefit of the general public interest\u201d and \u201cthe public service provided\u201d were adequately considered because the Secretary exempts from reimbursement requirements (1) state or local governments in certain circumstances when the right-of-way is for government purposes serving the general public, (2) road use agreements and reciprocal road use agreements, and (3) federal agencies. <em>Id. </em>at 205-06, \u00b6 47; 207-08, \u00b6 49.a.(iv).</p>\n<p id=\"b1010-9\">The contention that the 304(b) factors were adequately considered is belied by Interior\u2019s stipulation that \u201c[n]o consideration was given to the \u2018monetary value of the rights or privileges sought by the applicant,\u2019 [because] [t]his would require an independent economic review of each application which would be inefficient to government processing of applications.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 207, \u00b6 49.a.(ii).

The trial court in <em>PSC II </em>declared that \u201c[t]he rulemaking process is a singularly inappropriate vehicle by which to achieve compliance with FLPMA,\u201d and that consideration of at least the public versus private benefit and the public service standards \u201cmust be made on an individual, case-by-case basis.\u201d Slip op. at 26. The court in <em>Nevada Power Co. </em>reached a similar conclusion. <em>See </em>515 F.Supp. at 325. We are unwilling to go so far. \u201c[T]he choice made between proceeding by general rule or by individual, <em>ad hoc </em>litigation is one that lies primarily in the informed discretion of the administrative agency.\u201d <em>Securities &amp; Exchange </em>Commission v. <em>Chenery Corp., </em>332 U.S. 194, 203, 67 S.Ct. 1575, 1580, 91 L.Ed. 1995 (1947).</p>\n<p id=\"b1011-8\">We will not dictate the process to be used by Interior in weighing the factors listed in section 304(b).

Although it is difficult to envision in what manner \u201cthe monetary value of the rights or privileges sought,\u201d the \u201cportion of the cost incurred for the benefit of the general public interest rather than for the exclusive benefit of the applicant,\u201d or \u201cthe public service provided\u201d may be calculated other than by a determination in an individual case, Interior is free to do so by whatever means it finds practicable. The Department may, if it so chooses, use rulemaking as far as possible to achieve this result, bearing in mind only that \u201cthe problem may be so specialized and varying in nature as to be impossible of capture within the boundaries of a general rule.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1011-9\">In summary, the Secretary must examine and weigh each of the factors listed in section 304(b), as well as whatever other factors he finds relevant, in determining the \u201creasonable costs\u201d allowed by FLPMA to be assessed. The touchstone of the Secretary\u2019s determination is <em>reasonableness, </em>and the Secretary is thus vested with considerable discretion in performing the weighing mandated by section 304(b), whether by rulemaking or adjudication. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"928\">*928</page-number>However, we echo the trial court\u2019s admonition in <em>Nevada Power Co. </em>that the Secretary <em>must </em>provide a reasonably articulate record showing the bases of the determination so that a reviewing court might determine whether the action is in accordance with FLPMA. The record must be adequate to show that \u201cconsideration was given to the relevant factors and that the consideration was sufficiently meaningful to commend deference by the court.\u201d <em>Nevada Power Co., </em>515 F.Supp. at 325. <em>See Dunlop v. Bachowski, </em>421 U.S. 560, 571-72, 95 S.Ct. 1851, 1859-60, 44 L.Ed.2d 377 (1975); <em>see generally National Lime Ass'n v.

Costs of environmental impact statements</p>\n<p id=\"b1012-6\">Interior\u2019s practice of charging applicants for the costs of environmental impact statements triggered by right-of-way applications is a major issue of this appeal. The utilities argue that they should not be charged for the total costs of EIS preparation.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> They also argue that it is not reasonable under the Act to charge applicants for portions of an EIS that address impacts occurring on private lands apart from the right-of-way sought.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1012-11\">We note initially that this circuit has previously considered and rejected the argument that Interior may not require applicants for rights-of-way to reimburse <em>any </em>part of the cost of an EIS prepared in connection with processing their applications. In <em>Alumet </em>v. <em>Andrus, </em>607 F.2d 911 (10th Cir.1979), we held that FLPMA requires all reasonable costs incurred by the Secretary in processing applications to be chargeable against the applicant, and that those reasonable costs include costs of an EIS. <em>Id. </em>at 916. We expressly rejected the contention that an EIS \u201cinures solely to the benefit of the general public, and therefore, no part is assessable to the applicant.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We also considered and rejected the trial court\u2019s alternative holding that the provision in section 304(b) directing Interior to consider \u201c \u2018that portion of the costs incurred for the benefit of the general public rather than for the exclusive benefit of the applicant\u2019 ... <em>completely negated </em>the former provision in the same statute that reasonable costs included the cost of an environmental impact statement.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis in original). We held that the latter provision \u201cmay well <em>modify </em>the earlier provision ... but [it] does not, in effect, excise the former provision from the statute.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis in original).<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1013-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"929\">*929</page-number>Our construction of section 304(b) in the present case is in full accord with our holding in <em>Alumet. </em>The reasonableness factors do indeed modify the provision that \u201c \u2018reasonable costs\u2019 include ... the costs of ... environmental impact statements.\u201d FLPMA \u00a7 304(b). The Secretary must consider the reasonableness factors when assessing \u201creasonable costs\u201d of preparing an EIS triggered by an application.</p>\n<p id=\"b1013-5\">The utilities argue that it is not \u201creasonable\u201d under FLPMA to charge applicants for costs of studies examining the impacts of the applicants\u2019 projects that are caused by facilities or activities not located within the right-of-way sought. Their argument hinges on the assertion that such studies primarily benefit the public, because they \u201c[go] so far beyond what [the applicant] seeks from the BLM,\u201d namely, the right-of-way. Brief for Public Service at 50. The utilities also assert that charging for those often-massive studies contributes to the disproportion between costs of processing and the monetary value of the easement sought.</p>\n<p id=\"b1013-6\">The trial court in <em>PSC II </em>treated this issue under the rubric of NEPA, stating that \u201can EIS which conforms to the requirements of NEPA cannot be unreasonable for the purposes of FLPMA,\u201d slip op. at 28, \u201cnotwithstanding the fact that a considerable portion of the statement may speak to the environmental impact of a right-of-way on non-federal lands,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 29. The court cautioned that \u201cthe scope of an EIS ... <em>should generally be a factor </em>in the agency\u2019s consideration of the costs incurred for the benefit of the public at large.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis added). The district court in <em>Nevada Power Co. </em>apparently reached a similar result, rejecting the notion that total costs of an EIS are made \u201creasonable per se\u201d by their inclusion in the first provision of section 304(b). <em>See </em>515 F.Supp. at 317-22. The court held that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ao9-dedup-0\">\u201cthe standard for any inclusion of costs [including those of an EIS] ... is reasonableness ....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1013-7\">\u201c... Congress recognized that no hard and fast rule concerning EIS\u2019s should be crystallized with reference to every EIS, but the problem should be left for decision in view of the circumstances of each particular case with due consideration of the standards incorporated by Congress to guide and limit that discretion.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1013-9\"><em>Id. </em>at 322.</p>\n<p id=\"b1013-10\">Interior argues strenuously that FLPMA permits recovery of the full cost of an EIS necessitated by an application, even when the EIS considers impacts beyond the right-of-way itself. The parties\u2019 battle is joined in a field of caselaw extrinsic to that of FLPMA itself; thus, although our holding is dictated by our examination of FLPMA\u2019s legislative history, we shall briefly examine the cases upon which the parties rely. This examination will also guide our later consideration of the validity of the pre-FLPMA cost-reimbursement regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b1013-11\">In the companion cases of <em>National Cable Television Ass\u2019n v. United States, </em>415 U.S. 336, 94 S.Ct. 1146, 39 L.Ed.2d 370 (1974), and <em>Federal Power Commission v. New England Power Co., </em>415 U.S. 345, 94 S.Ct. 1151, 39 L.Ed.2d 383 (1974), the Supreme Court addressed the claim that fees assessed under the IOAA to industry members were \u201ctaxes\u201d levied by administrative agencies and therefore unconstitutional. The Court held that the IOAA granted agencies only the power to assess <em>fees </em>and not taxes, thereby avoiding the constitutional issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b1013-12\">In <em>National Cable, </em>the Court described a \u201cfee\u201d as \u201cincident to a voluntary act, <em>e.g., </em>a request that a public agency permit an applicant to practice law ... or run a broadcast station. [An] agency ... normally may exact a fee for a grant which, presumably, bestows a benefit on the applicant, not shared by other members of society.\u201d 415 U.S. at 340-41, 94 S.Ct. at 1148-49. The Court said that assessing industry members for the costs of oversight over the entire industry would require the members to pay \u201cnot only for benefits they received but for the protective services rendered the public by the Commission\u201d in its regulatory role, and suggested that such an assessment might be an unconstitutional tax. <em>See id. </em>at 341-42, 94 S.Ct. at 1149.</p>\n<p id=\"b1014-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"930\">*930</page-number>In <em>New England Power Co., </em>the Court stated that charges \u201c \u2018should be made to each <em>identifiable recipient </em>for a measurable unit or amount of Government service or property from which he derives a special benefit,\u2019 \u201d and \u201cthat no charge should be made for services rendered, \u2018when the identification of the ultimate beneficiary is obscure and the service can be primarily considered as benefitting broadly the general public.\u2019 \u201d 415 U.S. at 349-50, 94 S.Ct. at 1154 (quoting with approval a Bureau of the Budget interpretation) (emphasis in original). The Court said that such a construction \u201ckeeps [the Act] within the boundaries of the \u2018fee\u2019 system and away from the domain of \u2018taxes.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 351, 94 S.Ct. at 1155. Consequently, the Court struck down the cost-charge systems in both cases because they explicitly assessed an industry member with the agencies\u2019 costs of regulating the <em>entire industry, </em>rather than with that portion of the agencies\u2019 costs incurred in agency actions relating specifically to the industry member. In so doing, it noted that \u201c[c]ertainly some of the costs [of regulating an industry] inured to the benefit of the public.\u201d <em>National Cable, </em>415 U.S. at 343, 94 S.Ct. at 1150.</p>\n<p id=\"b1014-4\">The utilities argue that <em>National Cable </em>and <em>New England Power Co. </em>support their EIS argument, reasoning that an EIS primarily benefits the public and thus cannot be charged to an applicant. Interior disagrees, citing <em>Mississippi Power &amp; Light Co. v. United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission, </em>601 F.2d 223 (5th Cir.1979), <em>cert. denied, </em>444 U.S. 1102, 100 S.Ct. 1066, 62 L.Ed.2d 787 (1980). In <em>Mississippi Power, </em>the Fifth Circuit examined both <em>National Cable </em>and <em>New England Power Co., </em>and then held that the NRC could \u201crecover the <em>full cost </em>of providing a service to an identifiable beneficiary, regardless of the incidental public benefits flowing from the provision of that service.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 230 (emphasis in original). Accordingly, the court held that the Commission could recover from a license applicant the full costs of conducting environmental reviews required under NEPA \u201cbecause they are a prerequisite to the issuance of a license.... The Commission must conduct these reviews before it can issue a license to an applicant; it is a necessary part of the cost of providing a special benefit to the licensee. In other words, it is \u2018incident to a voluntary act.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 231 (quoting <em>National Cable, </em>415 U.S. at 340, 94 S.Ct. at 1148) (footnote omitted). It mattered not that there was an \u201cobvious public benefit flowing from the preparation of these environmental reviews.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1014-6\">The charges for environmental impact statements at issue in this ease represent the costs of studies required by law to be performed when an application triggers NEPA. <em>See </em>National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, \u00a7 102(2)(C), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 4332(2)(C) (1976). They are therefore unlike the charges struck down in <em>National Cable </em>and <em>New England Power Co. </em>These studies are a necessary prerequisite to the receipt by the applicant of a \u201cspecial benefit,\u201d the grant of a right-of-way. Therefore, Interior is not restrained by the doctrine laid out in <em>National Cable </em>and <em>New England Power Co. </em>from charging the full cost of such an EIS to the applicant. <em>Mississippi Power, </em>601 F.2d at 231. However, FLPMA requires the Secretary to consider \u201cthat portion of the cost incurred for the benefit of the general public interest rather than for the exclusive benefit of the applicant\u201d in determining \u201creasonable costs.\u201d FLPMA \u00a7 304(b). Although the preparation of an EIS may be triggered by an application, beyond a doubt it confers benefits on the general public as well. Hence, because of FLPMA\u2019s affirmative command, Interior must consider the benefit to the public interest when it determines \u201creason^ able costs\u201d of processing.</p>\n<p id=\"b1014-7\">It is admittedly difficult to draw a bright line between an EIS\u2019s \u201cgeneral public benefit\u201d and the benefit to the applicant. Certainly it does not depend on a distinction made between costs of studies of the effects within the right-of-way granted and NEPA-required studies of its effects on lands outside of the grant, since presumably an application could not be granted if the EIS were less than sufficient by NEPA\u2019s standards. Nonetheless, Congress\u2019 inclusion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"931\">*931</page-number>of the reasonableness factors requires that Interior consider the problem, however metaphysical it may be.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Interior may charge an applicant for the \u201creasonable\u201d costs of EIS preparation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1015-5\">2. Costs for work required even in the absence of a right-of-way application</p>\n<p id=\"b1015-6\">Public Service argues that Interior charges applicants for work that would have been done even absent an application. Interior denies this allegation and asserts: \u201cThe Secretary believes that he is not authorized to charge, and in fact does not charge, right-of-way applicants for work that would have been done in the absence of a right-of-way application.\u201d Reply Brief at 4. The utilities have identified no specific examples of charges for work that would have been done absent an application. We find the Secretary\u2019s interpretation of his authority, as quoted above, reasonable under FLPMA in light of our construction of section 304(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b1015-7\">3. Management overhead costs</p>\n<p id=\"b1015-8\">Section 304(b) states that in determining reasonable costs, the Secretary is to consider \u201cactual costs (exclusive of management overhead).\u201d Public Service argues that Interior\u2019s stipulated practice of charging applicants for certain \u201cindirect costs\u201d incurred by the agency, constitutes a charge for \u201cmanagement overhead.\u201d Interior replies that by regulation it excludes work deemed \u201cmanagement overhead\u201d from \u201cindirect costs.\u201d The utilities argue that <em>all </em>\u201cindirect costs\u201d \u2014 i.e., costs not allocable to specific applications \u2014 should be excluded as \u201cmanagement overhead.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1015-19\">The district court in <em>PSC II </em>expressly declined to reach this issue because of its disposition of the case, expecting Interior to properly apply and explain its application of the overhead exclusion in assessing \u201creasonable\u201d costs under section 304(b). <em>See </em>slip op. at 27. We do not address this issue here beyond noting that Interior is authorized by section 504(g) to collect \u201creasonable administrative and other costs.\u201d The exclusion of \u201cmanagement overhead,\u201d under our interpretation of section 304(b), modifies the authority granted in section 504(g) but does not negate it. We expect that Interior will, when calculating reasonable costs of processing, consider the factors listed in section 304(b) as construed in our opinion, as well as the Supreme Court\u2019s warning in <em>National Cable </em>and <em>New England Power Co. </em>that an applicant may not be charged for work relating to the agency\u2019s general costs of administration.</p>\n<p id=\"b1015-22\">F. <em>Retroactive Application</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1015-23\">Public Service argues that Interior may not use the FLPMA reimbursement regulations to recover costs incurred prior to the Act\u2019s passage. Interior asserts that FLPMA expressly authorizes such recovery:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"axb-dedup-0\">\u201cEffective on and after October 21, 1976, no right-of-way for the purposes listed in this subchapter shall be granted, issued, or renewed ... except under and subject to the provisions, limitations, and conditions of this subchapter .... <em>Any pending application for a right-of-way under any other law on the effective date of this section shall be considered as an application under this subchapter.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"AoeP\">FLPMA \u00a7 510(a), 43 U.S.C. \u00a7 1770 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b1015-25\">We must decide whether this language reflects congressional intent that Interior recover costs under FLPMA incurred prior to the Act\u2019s passage in processing applications for rights-of-way that were still pending on the date of enactment.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1015-26\">\u201c[T]he first rule of construction is that legislation must be considered as addressed to the future, not to the past.... [A] retrospective operation will not be given to a statute which interferes with antecedent rights, or by which human <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"932\">*932</page-number>action is regulated, unless such be \u2018the unequivocal and inflexible import of the terms and the manifest intention\u2019 of the legislature.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1016-4\"><em>Union Pacific Railroad v. Laramie Stock Yards Co., </em>231 U.S. 190, 199, 34 S.Ct. 101, 102, 58 L.Ed. 179 (1913) (quoting <em>United States v. Heth, </em>7 U.S. (3 Cranch) 399, 413, 2 L.Ed. 479 (1806)). This circuit has said that \u201c[n]ormally, retroactive application of legislative acts is impermissible absent a clear indication of congressional intent.\u201d <em>Jensen v. United States, </em>662 F.2d 664, 667 (10th Cir.1981); <em>accord Edgar v. Fred Jones Lincoln-Mercury, </em>524 F.2d 162 (10th Cir.1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b1016-5\">The question before us is purely one of legislative intent. This intent must be gleaned from the statute for there is little legislative history on the point. We believe the language of section 510(a) indicates that Congress intended costs to be assessed retroactively. Accordingly, we hold that Interior may charge applicants for rights-of-way pending at the date of FLPMA\u2019s enactment for \u201creasonable\u201d costs of processing incurred prior to the Act\u2019s passage. <em>See generally Hunter v. Morton, </em>529 F.2d 645, 648-49 (10th Cir.1976); <em>Hannifin v. Morton, </em>444 F.2d 200, 202-03 (10th Cir.1971); <em>Southwestern Petroleum Corp. v. Udall, </em>361 F.2d 650, 654-55 (10th Cir.1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b1016-6\">G. <em>The Pre-FLPMA Reimbursement Regulations</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1016-7\">Finally, we must consider the validity of the pre-FLPMA regulations and the effect of the trial court\u2019s holding in <em>PSC I </em>upon the cases on appeal here. The pre-FLPMA regulations were litigated in <em>PSC I, </em>where the trial court held that under the IOAA and the PLAA, Interior could recover only costs for services providing special benefits to applicants beyond those accruing to the public at large. The court held specifically that the costs of an EIS could not be charged to applicants because they did not \u201cprovide special benefits to [applicants] beyond those which accrue to the public at large.\u201d <em>PSC I, </em>433 F.Supp. at 156.</p>\n<p id=\"b1016-11\">One of the parties in <em>PSC II, </em>Sierra Pacific, was granted its right-of-way on July 6, 1976, three months prior to FLPMA\u2019s enactment. Interior charged costs against Sierra Pacific under the reimbursement regulations promulgated under the IOAA and PLAA, and not under the FLPMA regulations that we have struck down today. The trial court in <em>PSC II </em>held Interior collaterally estopped from contesting the validity of the pre-FLPMA regulations. <em>PSC II, </em>slip op. at 15. We agree that Interior is estopped to recover costs from Sierra Pacific under the earlier regulations,<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> and that those costs actually collected must be refunded.</p>\n<p id=\"b1016-12\">The pre-FLPMA regulations are also involved in <em>Colorado-Ute. </em>In that case, the trial court affirmed an IBLA decision imposing reimbursement costs on Colorado-Ute for expenses incurred in processing its application for a right-of-way granted prior to FLPMA, based on pre-FLPMA regulations. Colorado-Ute argues on appeal that Interior should be collaterally estopped <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"933\">*933</page-number>from contesting the regulations\u2019 validity because the issue was fully litigated in <em>PSC I. </em>However, Colorado-Ute did not raise this issue in the trial court, but instead contested the regulations on the merits. The utility may not raise this issue for the first time on appeal. <em>See, e.g., Bradford v. United States ex rel. Department of Interior, </em>651 F.2d 700, 704 (10th Cir.1981). The pre-FLPMA regulations were before the trial court, and its determination is open to our review on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1017-5\">The pre-FLPMA regulations were promulgated under the authority of the IOAA and the PLAA. Because we find the IOAA<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> dispositive, we do not address the other alleged sources of authority. Unlike FLPMA, the IOAA provides little legislative history relevant to cost reimbursement. Other than the statutory command that fees charged be \u201cfair and equitable,\u201d 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 483a, the IOAA reveals none of the evidence of Congressional intent that we found so compelling in construing FLPMA \u00a7 304(b). Colorado-Ute\u2019s only substantive argument is that the regulations were invalid under <em>National Cable </em>and <em>New England Power Co.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1017-6\">We have discussed those cases earlier in this opinion, and we will not repeat that discussion here. Interior may, consonant with <em>National Cable </em>and <em>New England Power Co., </em>recover the full costs of services provided to Colorado-Ute as an identifiable beneficiary. These costs may include the full expenses of an EIS triggered under NEPA by Colorado-Ute\u2019s application.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Interior may not charge Colorado-Ute with general management costs and other expenses not incurred in agency action relating specifically to Colorado-Ute\u2019s application. <em>See Mississippi Power, </em>601 F.2d at 230.</p>\n<p id=\"b1017-10\">The trial court\u2019s affirmance of the costs assessed against Colorado-Ute was apparently based on its analysis of FLPMA. We remand so that it may reexamine those charges under the IOAA in light of our opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1017-11\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b1017-12\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1017-13\">In conclusion, we hold that Interior must consider the factors listed in section 304(b) in establishing reasonable costs of processing applications for rights-of-way under FLPMA for reimbursement purposes. Because Interior did not adequately do so in promulgating its cost-reimbursement regulations, the regulations are invalid as inconsistent with and in excess of the authority granted by FLPMA. Interior may, consistently with this opinion, determine and assess the reasonable costs of processing an individual application either by rulemaking or by case-by-case adjudication. Reasonable costs of processing include the reasonable costs of EIS preparation, as determined using the section 304(b) factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b1017-14\">Where applications pending on the date of FLPMA\u2019s enactment are concerned, we hold that FLPMA authorizes the recovery of reasonable costs of processing incurred by Interior prior to that date. With respect to Colorado-Ute only, we hold that Interior may properly charge the actual costs of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"934\">*934</page-number>processing Colorado-Ute\u2019s pre-FLPMA applications.</p>\n<p id=\"b1018-4\">We have considered the other issues raised in these three cases and find them to be without merit. <em>Colorado-Ute </em>is accordingly reversed in part. <em>PSC II </em>and <em>Nevada Power Co. </em>are affirmed insofar as they are consistent with this opinion. All three cases are remanded for further proceedings in accordance herewith.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1000-11\">.

Interior\u2019s argument is not persuasive. The \u201cother factors\u201d phrase is a recognition of the Secretary\u2019s greater expertise and discretion in the administration of applications relating to the public lands.

We find this language quite persuasive. Conference committee reports carry great weight in the discernment of congressional intent. Being commended to the entire Congress, they are more likely to have received the attention and concurrence of the voting members of both the House and Senate prior to a bill\u2019s passage than are other sources from within the array of legislative history. <em>See American Jewish Congress v.

The Supreme Court explained in <em>Batterton </em>that varying degrees of deference are to be accorded to administrative interpretations of statutes, based on several factors. See 432 U.S. at 425 &amp; n. 9, 97 S.Ct. at 2405 &amp; n. 9. For example, where Congress expressly delegates the power to prescribe standards in interpreting and applying a statutory term, a resulting regulation is entitled to greater deference, because \u201cCongress entrusts to the Secretary, rather than to the courts, the primary responsibility for interpreting the statutory term.\u201d <em>Batterton, </em>432 U.S. at 426, 97 S.Ct. at 2406.
