The magistrate held a three-day evidentiary hearing involving numerous factual disputes and filed a twenty-five page report recommending denial of the habeas petition. The petitioner filed timely objections to the magistrate\u2019s report. These objections were based, <em>inter alia, </em>on the credibility determinations made by the magistrate. Based on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"620\">*620</page-number>the magistrate\u2019s report, the district court filed a memorandum opinion and order in May 1982 denying the habeas petition. This order was entered prior to the time the transcript of the evidentiary hearing was prepared.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b704-4\">Because it appears that the district court\u2019s approval of the magistrate\u2019s report did not constitute a <em>de novo </em>review of the portions of the magistrate\u2019s report to which the petitioner objected, as required by 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636(b)(1), we remand this case to the district court for such <em>de novo </em>review based on the now-available transcript of the hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-5\">In 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636(b)(1), it is provided that \u201c[a] judge of the court shall make a <em>de novo </em>determination of those portions of the [magistrate\u2019s] report or specified proposed findings or recommendations to which objection is made.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b704-6\">While the Supreme Court has indicated that it is not necessary that the district court hold a <em>de novo </em>hearing under section 636(b)(1) to resolve credibility issues, <em>United States v. Raddatz, </em>447 U.S. 667, 673-76,100 S.Ct. 2406, 2411-13, 65 L.Ed.2d 424 (1980), we held in <em>United States v. Elsoffer, </em>644 F.2d 357, 359 (5th Cir.1981), an evidentiary suppression case, that \u201can appellate court must be satisfied that a district judge has exercised his non-delegable authority by considering the actual testimony, and not merely by reviewing the magistrate\u2019s report and recommendations.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b704-7\">The respondent argues that here the district court\u2019s memorandum order constituted an \u201cindependent and <em>de novo </em>determination of the contested factual findings made by the magistrate.\u201d While this is no doubt true, a review of the factual findings made by a magistrate is not the same thing as a <em>de novo </em>review of the evidence itself. The magistrate\u2019s findings -are persuasive and well-documented; however, the statutory obligation of the district court to arrive at its own, independent conclusion about those portions of the magistrate\u2019s report to which objection is made is not satisfied by a mere review of the magistrate\u2019s report itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-10\">There is no indication in the magistrate\u2019s report or in the district court\u2019s memorandum order that any tape recording or record of the evidentiary hearing was made, other than the (belated) transcript. <em>Calderon v. Waco Lighthouse for the Blind, </em>630 F.2d 352, 356 (5th Cir.1980) (record silent as to any tape recording of the proceedings). It therefore appears that the district court could not have complied with the required <em>de novo </em>determination.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b704-11\">It is especially important in resolving credibility disputes that the district court review the verbatim account of the eviden-tiary hearing conducted by the magistrate. Perhaps such a verbatim record is not so significant when the issue involves a pure question of law or even a mixed question of fact and law. Here, however, where the magistrate\u2019s recommendation was based on conflicting testimony, it was especially significant that the district court, in complying with section 636(b)(1), conduct a <em>de novo </em>review of the testimony itself. The district court nowhere states that such review was made and, as stated, it does not appear that such a review would have been possible.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-12\">For these reasons, therefore, this case is remanded to the district court so that it may conduct a <em>de novo </em>determination of those portions of the magistrate\u2019s report to which objection has been made.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-13\">REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b703-26\">. Petitioner was in jail awaiting sentencing on a conviction for capital murder.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b704-8\">. Although the evidentiary hearing before the magistrate was held in June 1981, the transcript was not completed and filed with the district court until December 1982, over six months after the district court\u2019s order denying the writ. Appeal had already been filed with this court prior to the filing of the transcript, and an order allowing supplementing of the record was granted in order to include the hearing transcript in the record on appeal. No explanation of the delay in preparation of the transcript has been given this court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b704-16\">.
