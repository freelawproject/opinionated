Inc. (\u201cChevron\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b688-21\">Chevron appeals from judgments awarding substantial damages (over $3 million) to these three individuals. It raises these issues: that the trial court abused its discretion in denying Chevron\u2019s motion for continuance because one of the plaintiffs, David Fontenot, was not present at the trial; and, that the trial court erred in refusing to grant Chevron indemnity or, in the alternative, contribution from the employer of the three individuals, Offshore Painting Contractors, Inc. (\u201cOffshore Painting\u201d) because of the alleged negligence of Offshore Painting and because of an indemnity provision in the written agreement between Offshore and Chevron.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-22\">In addition, Chevron appeals from a judgment awarding $160,000 in damages to Continental Insurance Company (\u201cContinental\u201d) as reimbursement for the payment by Continental for the loss of Offshore\u2019s paint boat which was destroyed by the explosion. Here, Chevron argues that the trial court erred because the insurance policies which were issued by Continental to Offshore Painting \u2014 and under which this amount was paid \u2014 named Chevron as an additional assured and waived all rights of subrogation against Chevron.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>The issues raised by Chevron are without merit. Indeed, two of them are frivolous because they were never presented to the trial court. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-5\">\n<em>Facts and Procedural History</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b689-6\">Chevron contracted for Offshore Painting to perform sandblasting and painting work on a number of permanent offshore platforms which were owned and operated by Chevron in the production of oil and gas off the coast of Louisiana.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> One of the two vessels which Offshore Painting used to transport its employees and their equipment to these offshore platforms was a three-year old paint boat, the M/Y SANDRA P.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-7\">On June 14, 1978, the day of the explosion, the SANDRA P arrived at Chevron\u2019s Platform 181-A with a painting crew to continue work which had been in progress for several days.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Bobby Windham was the foreman of this painting crew. David Fon-tenot was a painter in the crew. Michael Wiley, a seaman, was the unlicensed \u201cmaster\u201d or \u201ccaptain\u201d of the SANDRA P; this was his first trip to Platform 181-A, which was some twenty miles offshore.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-8\">Wiley moored the SANDRA P at the boat dock on the south side of the production platform. Although there were other boat docks on the east and west sides, Wiley chose this one because of the direction of the wind and seas and because the air lines used by the painting crew from the previous day were already hanging off the platform by the south boat dock.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> After the SANDRA P docked, Windham and Fonten-ot went aboard the platform to begin work, while Wiley remained on the paint boat to go to sleep.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-14\">Fontenot started \u201cspot painting\u201d on top of a large tank, called a \u201chigh pressure bulk separator,\u201d which was close to the boat dock on the south side of the platform. Attached to this bulk separator was a pressure relief valve which was set so that the contents of the tank would be discharged if the pressure in the bulk separator became too high or too low. The discharge line from the bulk separator ran to the south side of the platform, then made a 90\u00b0 turn directly downward, so that the end of the discharge line was approximately forty-four feet above the south boat dock (and the SANDRA P).</p>\n<p id=\"b689-15\">About noon, the pressure relief valve suddenly broke \u2014 there was a loud noise, described by various witnesses as sounding like \u201ca pop-off valve going off,\u201d followed by a \u201crushing noise\u201d \u2014 and the gas and other contents of the bulk separator tank were released through the discharge line. The gas was immediately ignited by some unknown source,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and the explosion caused a fire which covered the entire south side of the platform. The SANDRA P was also engulfed in flames.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-16\">Fontenot fell to the platform deck from the top of the bulk separator tank; Wind-ham slipped and fell to the deck from the catwalk; both were able to escape the fire by jumping from the platform into the water. Wiley awoke to find the SANDRA P in flames but, finally, he was able to run through the fire and dive into the water. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>All three were later rescued by workers on the platform, but each was seriously injured: Wiley suffered burns on 90% of his body; Windham had severe spinal injuries; and Fontenot fractured vertebra in his neck and spine.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The SANDRA P was almost totally destroyed.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-4\">Wiley filed suit against both Chevron and Offshore Painting, as did Windham. Fon-tenot filed suit only against Chevron. The claims in the three actions were based upon negligence and strict liability under state law, Articles 2315, 2317 and 2322 of the Louisiana Civil Code, and upon the Longshoremen's and Harbor Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 901 et seq.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> By various motions filed in these suits \u2014 and by three other lawsuits: one filed by Offshore Painting, one filed by Continental Insurance, and one filed by B.F. Herrington Enterprises (\u201cHerrington\u201d) \u2014 these additional claims were made:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b690-5\">(i) Chevron and Offshore Painting sought recovery from each other for indemnity or, in the alternative, for contribution;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b690-6\">(ii) Offshore Painting sought \u201cexoneration from and limitation of liability\u201d as owner of the vessel SANDRA P;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b690-7\">(iii) Chevron sought recovery from Continental on the marine hull and marine P &amp; I insurance policies issued to Offshore Painting \u2014 which covered the SANDRA P and which named Chevron as an additional assured;<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b690-8\">(iv) Continental sought recovery from Chevron for the amounts it had paid, under the insurance policies issued to Offshore Painting, for the loss of the SANDRA P ($160,000) and for the \u201cmaintenance and cure\u201d of the plaintiff Wiley ($70,366.19); and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b690-14\">(v) Herrington, the owner of the compressor and other equipment on the SANDRA P, sought recovery from Chevron or Offshore Painting for the loss of these items.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b690-15\">In other words, this was \u201canother one of those seagoing donnybrooks in which all generously claim that someone else must bear the burden of amounts paid to a seaman [and two painters] for injuries sustained during a typical off-shore drilling operation in Louisiana shelf waters.\u201d <em>La-nasse v. Travelers Ins. Co., </em>450 F.2d 580, 581 (5th Cir.1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b690-16\">These six cases were consolidated for trial. The claims of the three individuals (Wiley, Windham, Fontenot) were submitted to a jury. The remaining issues, including indemnity and contribution, were reserved for decision by the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-17\">Chevron contended at trial \u2014 just as it does on appeal \u2014 that Michael Wiley was negligent in docking the SANDRA P downwind on the south end of the platform, \u201cdirectly below the gas discharge lines\u201d from the bulk separator tank, while carrying \u201ca highly inflammable cargo\u201d of paints and solvents. In response, the plaintiffs (and Offshore Painting) presented evidence that Wiley was not negligent: that he chose the south boat dock because of the wind and sea direction and because the air lines were already there; that there was no warning sign at this dock; that Chevron <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>employees used it \u201call the time\u201d; and that Offshore\u2019s crews had used this dock without incident on prior occasions. In addition, they contended that the explosion was caused by Chevron\u2019s negligence because:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b691-5\">(i) A nut connecting the pressure relief valve was severely corroded. This caused it to break and release the gas through the discharge line. The explosion would not have happened if Chevron had used a stainless steel nut which would not corrode \u2014 indeed, certain Chevron documents indicated that stainless steel parts should have been used on the relief valve \u2014 or if Chevron had properly inspected and replaced the corroded nut;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b691-6\">(ii) The gas discharge lines from the bulk separator should not have been near the boat dock area, and certainly should not have had the 90\u00b0 downward turn because this put the end of the discharge line directly above any vessels that were moored at the south dock. The explosion would not have occurred if the discharge line had been properly constructed \u2014 indeed, certain Chevron documents established that the 90\u00b0 downward turn was a mistake \u2014 and no other Chevron platform had a discharge line constructed like this.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b691-7\">Chevron, in return, argued that the SANDRA P was unseaworthy and that Offshore Painting was negligent because its employees \u2014 particularly Fontenot, who was painting the bulk separator tank and the pressure relief valve \u2014 should have discovered any defective or corroded nut.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-8\">After a trial of almost two weeks (June 1-10, 1981), the jury resolved every issue against Chevron and in favor of the plaintiffs and Offshore Painting. Specifically, it found that (i) neither Wiley nor the other plaintiffs were negligent; (ii) Offshore Painting was not negligent; (iii) the SANDRA P was not unseaworthy; (iv) Chevron was negligent, the platform was defective, and this was the sole cause of the explosion; and (v) Chevron was liable to Wiley for $2,250,000, to Windham for $330,000, and to Fontenot for $500,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-10\">The trial court also resolved every issue against Chevron in its Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law. Using the jury\u2019s findings as advisory, the court held that Chevron\u2019s negligence caused the explosion; that Offshore Painting was not negligent and the SANDRA P was not unseaworthy; that Chevron was not entitled to indemnity or contribution; and that Offshore Painting and the SANDRA P were entitled to exoneration from liability. Accordingly, on June 24, 1981, the trial court entered the judgments which occasioned this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-11\">\n<em>The Motion for Continuance</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b691-12\">Chevron\u2019s first issue misrepresents the facts to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-13\">Chevron states that it requested the trial court to grant a continuance because the absence of a supposed \u201ckey witness,\u201d the plaintiff David Fontenot, would prevent \u201cChevron from fairly presenting its case.\u201d This is not true. Chevron made no such request. To the contrary, Chevron objected to any testimony by Fontenot (except that presented through his deposition).</p>\n<p id=\"b691-14\">At the very beginning of the trial, Fon-tenot\u2019s attorney announced that his client had been \u201coperated on [last] Thursday morning\u201d and, according to a letter from the doctor, \u201cwill be in the hospital for four or five days.\u201d Chevron immediately moved for a continuance \u2014 but solely on the grounds that the jury might think that the injuries sustained by Fontenot in the explosion were so serious that they were preventing him from attending trial. Specifically, the Chevron attorney stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b691-15\">\u201cI move to continue the trial on the grounds that this is a witness that has now gone into the hospital, the inference drawn by his not appearing and the testimony of the doctors who undoubtedly testify in his behalf will be highly prejudicial to this defendant....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b691-16\">\n<em>U</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b691-17\">\u201c... It is submitted that this, as I understand it is an ulcer attention (sic)<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number>and surgery that here we have a case that is going to trial now and it\u2019s true the plaintiff\u2019s deposition has been recorded, but the inference to this Jury is this man is in the hospital based upon this particular condition and this incident and no question of that is going to be presented to the Jury. We would certainly object to the man coming into the Court four or five days after surgery with a fresh scar and all the problems that might be encountered with respect to surgery. It is highly prejudicial to Chevron....\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b692-4\">The requested continuance was opposed by every other party in the six consolidated cases. The trial court denied Chevron\u2019s motion, but cautioned the jury that Fontenot\u2019s absence was unexpected \u2014 and that the jury would have to decide, under all of the evidence, whether \u201cthis present hospitalization [is] in any way or is not in any way connected with his original claim.\u201d Chevron made no objection to this instruction.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b692-5\">At no time did Chevron request a continuance on the grounds that Fontenot was \u201ca key witness in Chevron\u2019s case.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Chevron never advised the trial court that \u201cFontenot alone knew and could testify about the events leading up to the fracturing of the relief valve.\u201d Nor did Chevron ever contend, as it does on appeal, that Fontenot\u2019s deposition \u201cdid not deal sufficiently with these issues.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> And, Chevron never made any attempt during the two-week trial to subpoena Fontenot to testify \u2014 even though the attorney for Fontenot had indicated that his client should be released from the hospital by the second or third day of trial and that we \u201cdo plan to go ahead and try to bring him, if we have to, before the end of the trial.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b692-10\">Instead, contrary to Chevron\u2019s first issue on appeal its attorney told the trial court that Chevron objected to any live testimony by Fontenot during trial:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b692-11\">\u201c... Your Honor, he did this upon his own, through his doctor, and he knew that this case was fixed for trial and had been fixed for trial for many, many months. He had this ulcer condition, as I understand had previous surgery with respect to the ulcer condition and to now bring this before the Jury and it is calculated to have no other effect than to prejudice, at least our position in this case and not only oppose the Court going forward with the trial at this time, <em>would further oppose the man making an appearance in this trial </em>in connection with surgery that has happened to him within four or five days of the trial. I think it is highly prejudicial, Your Honor. We so move the Court to continue this case.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b692-12\">Therefore, Chevron\u2019s first issue on appeal is frivolous because it was never presented <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"609\">*609</page-number>to the trial court. <em>Shingleton v. Armor Velvet Corp., </em>621 F.2d 180, 183 (5th Cir. 1980); <em>Mayberry v. Davis, </em>608 F.2d 1070, 1071-72 (5th Cir.1979); <em>Martin Oil Co. v. Gulf Ins. Co., </em>605 F.2d 197, 199 (5th Cir. 1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b693-6\">In addition, under the circumstances of this case, it is clear that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying Chevron\u2019s motion for continuance: the three plaintiffs had suffered severe injuries; the case was almost three years old and a continuance may have delayed the trial for months, perhaps even a year; two of the plaintiffs were present at trial, while Fontenot\u2019s deposition had been taken about one year after the accident and was available for use at trial; if additional testimony from Fontenot was needed, any party could subpoena him (or take his deposition during a trial break); there would be additional expense of trial preparation and inconvenience to witnesses if the case were postponed; and, each of the other eight parties in the consolidated trials opposed Chevron\u2019s motion for continuance. <em>See Lopez v. Aransas County Independent School District, </em>570 F.2d 541, 544 (5th Cir.1978); <em>Webb v. Dresser Industries, </em>536 F.2d 603, 610 (5th 1976); <em>Roberts </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>456 F.2d 819, 824-25 (5th Cir.1971), <em>cert. denied, </em>404 U.S. 866, 92 S.Ct. 83, 30 L.Ed.2d 110 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b693-8\">\n<em>Offshore\u2019s Alleged \u201cStatutory Violation\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"ADv\">Chevron\u2019s second issue is also being raised for the first time on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-9\">Chevron argues that it is entitled to indemnity or contribution because \u201cOffshore Painting was negligent as a matter of law in failing to have a licensed pilot or mate aboard\u201d the SANDRA P, in violation of 46 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 390, 404 and 405. According to Chevron, since the plaintiff Wiley did not have a license, it is presumed under \u201cthe Pennsylvania Rule\u201d that Offshore\u2019s statutory violation was \u201cat least a contributing cause of the explosion\u201d \u2014 and that the burden was upon Offshore Painting to prove that absence of a licensed pilot \u201ccould not have been a contributing cause of the disaster.\u201d <em>The E. Madison Hall, </em>140 F.2d 589, 591 (4th Cir.1944); <em>Armstrong v. Chambers &amp; Kennedy, </em>340 F.Supp. 1220, 1246 (S.D. Tex.1972), rev\u2019d on other grounds sub. nom. <em>In re Dearborn Marine Service, Inc., </em>499 F.2d 263 (5th Cir.1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b693-12\">This contention was never presented to the trial court. The so-called \u201cPennsylvania Rule\u201d is not even mentioned in the Pre-Trial Order or in Chevron\u2019s motions for directed verdict or its post-trial motion for j.n.o.v. or new trial. There is no reference to Offshore\u2019s supposed \u201cnegligence as a matter of law\u201d or its alleged statutory violation in the Pre-Trial Order or in Chevron\u2019s trial or post-trial motions.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> It is obvious, therefore, that Chevron\u2019s second issue is not properly before this court since \u201cmatters raised for the first time on appeal will not be considered.\u201d <em>Shingleton </em>v. <em>Armor Velvet Corp., </em>621 F.2d 180, 183 (5th Cir.1980); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Silva, </em>611 F.2d 78, 80 (5th Cir.1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b693-13\">In addition, even if this issue were properly before us, Chevron\u2019s arguments are totally without merit: there was no \u201cstatutory violation\u201d by Offshore Painting because the statutes cited by Chevron \u2014 46 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 390, 404 and 405 \u2014 were not applicable to the SANDRA P and did not require the plaintiff Wiley to have a license. By their very terms, section 390 applies only if the vessel is carrying \u201cpassengers\u201d other than the crew and employees of the owner of the vessel; section 404 applies only to vessels carrying \u201cpassengers for hire\u201d; and section 405 applies only to \u201ctug boats, tow<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"610\">*610</page-number>ing boats and freight boats.\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> The SANDRA P was merely carrying the painting crew and equipment to Chevron\u2019s offshore production platform; it was not carrying \u201cpassengers\u201d or \u201cpassengers for hire,\u201d nor was it a \u201cfreight boat.\u201d Obviously, not one of these statutes required Offshore Painting to have a \u201clicensed pilot or mate\u201d on the SANDRA P.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b694-4\">\n<em>The Indemnity Provision</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"aea-dedup-0\">Chevron\u2019s third issue <em>was </em>presented to the trial court. However, it was also presented by Chevron to this court eight years ago in <em>Smith v. Chevron Oil Co., </em>517 F.2d 1154 (5th Cir.1975) and <em>Stephens v. Chevron Oil Co., </em>517 F.2d 1123 (5th Cir. 1975). We rejected Chevron\u2019s argument then; we do so again now.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-5\">Specifically, Chevron claims it is entitled to indemnity or, in the alternative, contribution under the \u201cindemnity provision\u201d in its agreement with Offshore Painting. However, this identical provision was involved in both <em>Smith </em>and <em>Stephens </em>\u2014where Chevron\u2019s negligence was the sole cause of the accidents involved and where we held unequivocally that this indemnity provision \u201cdoes not provide for indemnification for [Chevron\u2019s] own negligence in the clear and specific language required by Louisiana law\u201d (517 F.2d at 1157). In the present case, both the jury and the trial judge found that Chevron\u2019s negligence was the sole cause of the explosion. Therefore, Chevron is not entitled to indemnity or contribution from Offshore Painting. <em>Smith v. Chevron Oil Co., </em>517 F.2d at 1157; <em>Stephens v. Chevron Oil Co., </em>517 F.2d at 1125.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b694-10\">Of course, just as it did in <em>Smith, </em>Chevron argues that the findings by the jury and by the trial court should be overturned because they are \u201cclearly erroneous\u201d<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> \u2014 and that, once this is done, Chevron would be entitled to recovery under the indemnity provision. To support this argument, Chevron simply ignores all of the unfavorable evidence presented at trial and concludes, based solely upon a review of the evidence favorable to Chevron, that both Wiley and Offshore Painting were negligent concerning the docking of the SANDRA P at the south end of the platform directly below the gas discharge lines.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-11\">Obviously, this approach is improper and Chevron\u2019s argument is frivolous. The findings of the trial court can be disturbed only if they are \u201cclearly erroneous\u201d under a review of <em>all </em>of the evidence. Fed.R.Civ.P. 52(a); <em>Verrett v. McDonough Marine Service, </em>705 F.2d 1437 (5th Cir.1983). And, the findings of the jury can be set aside only if, \u201cviewing the evidence <em>as a whole </em>and in the light most favorable to the [opposing] party,\u201d reasonable men could not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"611\">*611</page-number>arrive at the verdict that Chevron\u2019s negligence was the sole cause of the explosion. <em>Thezan v. Maritime Overseas Corp., </em>708 F.2d 175 (5th Cir.1983); <em>Crumpton </em>v. <em>Confederation Life Ins. Co., </em>672 F.2d 1248 (5th Cir.1982). It is clear that the evidence in this case \u2014 particularly the testimony which Chevron even avoids discussing \u2014 is sufficient to sustain the findings of the jury and of the trial court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b695-5\">(i) that Wiley was not negligent in mooring the SANDRA P at the south boat dock; this was, after all, a boat dock and Chevron employees used it for their vessels \u201call the time\u201d; Offshore\u2019s crews had used this dock without incident on prior occasions; Chevron had placed no \u201cwarning signs\u201d at this location; and Wiley chose the south dock because of the wind and sea direction and because the air lines used by the previous paint crew were already there.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b695-6\">(ii) that the explosion at Platform 181-A was caused solely by Chevron\u2019s negligence (a) in using a nut on the pressure relief valve which was subject to corrosion, and in failing to inspect and replace this corroded nut, and (b) in constructing the gas discharge line so that it ended directly above any vessels moored at the boat dock on the south side of the platform.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b695-7\">Although these conclusions are easily reached, we must address an issue raised by the recent decision of <em>Hyde v. Chevron U.S.A. Inc., </em>697 F.2d 614 (5th Cir.1983).<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Both <em>Smith </em>and <em>Stephens </em>relied upon cases \u2014 primarily <em>Cole v. Chevron Chemical Co., </em>477 F.2d 361, 367-69 (5th Cir.1973)\u2014 which held that, under Louisiana law, the \u201cparties\u2019 clear and unequivocal intent to indemnify against damages caused solely by the indemnitee\u2019s own negligence must be expressly articulated by specific reference to \u2018negligence\u2019 \u201d (477 F.2d at 368). <em>Hyde </em>v. <em>Chevron </em>holds that this <em>is not </em>a correct statement of the Louisiana law:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b695-10\">\u201cFinally and importantly, as we read the workover agreement, the intent of the parties was that Pool, the drilling contractor in charge of operations on the platform, agreed to indemnify Chevron against any claims for injuries to Pool\u2019s employees. Before reaching this agreement we reviewed the federal and Louisiana cases involving indemnity agreements. We shall not go through the tedious review that we considered necessary in discussing contributory negligence as a defense to strict liability. We reached the same conclusion Judge Stagg reached in <em>Battig v. Hartford Accident and Indemnity Co., </em>482 F.Supp. 338 (W.D.La. 1977). After reviewing the authorities including, of course, <em>Cole v. Chevron Chemical Company, </em>5 Cir.1973, 477 F.2d 361, Judge Stagg concluded:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b695-11\">... <em>Louisiana does not require a specific reference to negligent acts in order for an indemnity agreement or a release to cover claims based on negligent acts. </em>However, the intention of the parties, as inferred from the language of their agreement must clearly indicate an intention to include negligent acts without the indemnity agreement or the release.\u201d (697 F.2d at 633) (Emphasis added).<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b695-12\">This does not change our conclusions in this case. Here, the indemnity provision does not \u201cclearly indicate\u201d the intention of the parties that Chevron would be entitled to indemnity even though its negligence was the sole cause of the explosion. The complete provision reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b695-13\">\u201cContractor [Offshore Painting] agrees to defend and hold Company [Chevron] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"612\">*612</page-number>indemnified and harmless from and against any loss, expense, claim or demand for:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b696-4\">(a) Injury to or death of [Offshore\u2019s] employees or for damage to or loss of [Offshore\u2019s] property in any way arising out of or connected with the performance by [Offshore] of services hereunder; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b696-5\">(b) Injury to, or death of, third persons or the employees of [Chevron] or for damage to or loss of property of [Chevron] or of third persons, in any way arising out of or connected with the performance by [Offshore] of services hereunder, <em>unless caused solely by the negligence of [Chevron]; provided that if such injury, death, damage or loss is caused by the joint or concurrent negligence of [Offshore] and [Chevron], each shall be liable for one-half of the loss, expense, claim, or demand resulting therefrom.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b696-6\">[Chevron] shall have the right, at its option, to participate in the defense of any such suit without relieving [Offshore] of any obligation hereunder.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b696-7\">Obviously, the intention of the parties is \u201cclearly indicated\u201d by the underscored language in <em>paragraph (b): </em>If the employees or property of Chevron (or a third party) are injured or damaged in an accident caused solely by Chevron\u2019s negligence, then Chevron is not entitled to indemnity from Offshore Painting; if the accident is caused \u201cby the joint or concurrent negligence\u201d of Chevron and Offshore Painting, then each is to be liable for one-half of the resulting damages; if the accident is caused solely by the negligence of Offshore Painting, then Chevron is entitled to full indemnity.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-8\">However, there is no such clear and unambiguous language in <em>paragraph (a) </em>\u2014which is the provision involved in this case because it covers injuries to Offshore\u2019s employees (Wiley, Windham, Fontenot) and damages to Offshore\u2019s property (the SANDRA P). Chevron offers no explanation of why the specific language concerning \u201csole negligence\u201d or \u201cjoint or concurrent negligence\u201d was not used in both paragraphs. Nor can Chevron offer any reasonable explanation of why it would expect or \u201cintend\u201d the language of paragraph (a) to afford indemnity for Chevron\u2019s own negligence when this court had specifically held \u2014 some two years before the execution of the \u201cmaster services agreement\u201d between Chevron and Offshore Painting\u2014 that this identical language did not entitle Chevron to indemnity if the accident was caused solely by Chevron\u2019s negligence. <em>Smith v. Chevron Oil Co., </em>517 F.2d at 1157; <em>Stephens v. Chevron Oil Co., </em>517 F.2d at 1125.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-11\">Therefore, unlike the indemnity clause involved in <em>Hyde v. Chevron, </em>697 F.2d at 633-34, the provision in this case is ambiguous because of the different wording used in the two paragraphs. Certainly, there is no \u201cclear indication\u201d that the parties intended that Chevron would be indemnified, under paragraph (a), even if its negligence was the sole cause of the injuries to Offshore\u2019s employees and the damage to its property.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b696-12\">Finally, we also emphasize that the indemnity question in <em>Hyde v. Chevron </em>was quite different from the one in this case. There, as stressed throughout the opinion (697 F.2d at 632-35), <em>Chevron was not negligent. </em>Instead, the negligence of the offshore drilling contractor, Pool, was the sole cause of the faulty step on the platform which resulted in injury to Pool\u2019s employee (Hyde). Although Pool had \u201ccomplete control of the drilling operations\u201d and the offshore platform, Chevron had been held liable for the injuries to Pool\u2019s employee on a theory of strict liability \u2014 that \u201cthe injury was \u2018occasioned\u2019 by the \u2018ruin\u2019 of a \u2018build<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"613\">*613</page-number>ing\u2019 \u201d (the offshore drilling platform), in violation of article 2322 of the Louisiana Civic Code \u2014 and Chevron, in turn, was seeking indemnity from the party (Pool) whose negligence (i) was the sole cause of the accident and (ii) had rendered the platform a \u201cruin\u201d under article 2322. The <em>Hyde </em>opinion reasons that \u201cthe basis for the general rule of not allowing a party to contract against his own negligence is not applicable to strict liability cases\u201d (697 F.2d at 632), and holds:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b697-5\">\u201c... We have not been referred to any ease, nor have we found any case, in which there is any discussion of the applicability of an indemnity clause to strict liability. The policies underlying strict liability argue for permitting indemnity agreements and we have no reason to assume that the principles of contractual construction would be different in a strict liability case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b697-6\">\n<em>U</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b697-7\">\u201cWe hold that the clear intention of parties was that Pool should indemnify Chevron against all claims of Pool\u2019s employees, including claims based on strict liability under article 2322 of the Louisiana Civil Code.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b697-8\">(697 F.2d at 633, 635.)</p>\n<p id=\"b697-9\">However, <em>Hyde v. Chevron </em>repeatedly emphasizes that \u201cthe record shows no evidence of any negligence on the part of Chevron and its [strict] liability is based solely on ownership of the platform\u201d (697 F.2d at 633). Thus, <em>Hyde </em>was not confronted, as we are, with a claim by Chevron for indemnity from its own negligence \u2014 and <em>Hyde </em>does not overrule <em>Smith v. Chevron, </em>517 F.2d at 1157; <em>Stephens v. Chevron, </em>517 F.2d at 1125; or the other Fifth Circuit decisions (see footnote 17) which rejected Chevron\u2019s attempts to obtain indemnity where its negligence was the sole cause of the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-11\">\n<em>The Loss of the SANDRA P</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b697-12\">Chevron\u2019s last issue is properly before this court, and it is not frivolous \u2014 but this issue involves only the judgment in favor of Continental Insurance for the $160,000 it paid to Offshore Painting for the loss of the SANDRA P.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b697-13\">Under its agreement with Chevron, Offshore Painting obtained a marine hull insurance policy covering the SANDRA P, along with worker\u2019s compensation, employee\u2019s liability, and marine P &amp; I policies.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> These policies were issued by Continental; both the marine hull and the marine P &amp; I policies contained identical form provisions naming Chevron as an additional assured, and waiving all rights of subrogation against Chevron, but only with regard to vessels \u201cthat may be employed by or actually working for\u201d Chevron.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-14\">Chevron first cites cases holding that an insurer cannot recover against its own assured, even as a subrogee against an \u201cadditional assured,\u201d particularly when the policy contains a specific waiver of subrogation against the additional assured. <em>Tidewater Equipment Co. v. Reliance Ins. Co., </em>650 F.2d 503 (4th Cir.1981); <em>Continental Oil Co. v. Bonanza Corp., </em>511 F.Supp. 62 (S.D.Tex. 1980). Then, based upon dicta in <em>Lanasse v. Travelers Ins. Co., </em>450 F.2d 580, 584-85 (5th Cir.1971), <em>cert. denied sub nom. Chevron Oil Co. v. Royal Ins. Co., </em>406 U.S. 921, 92 S.Ct. 1779, 32 L.Ed.2d 120 (1972), Chevron argues that \u2014 even though Chevron\u2019s negligence in constructing and operating the production platform was the sole cause of the explosion (and the destruction of the SANDRA P)\u2014 Continental is precluded from any recovery against it because the marine hull policy named Chevron as an additional assured and waived subrogation rights against it.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-15\">This argument, too, is baseless. By being named as an additional assured on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"614\">*614</page-number>the marine hull and P &amp; I policies, Chevron was protected from any liability arising from the operation of the SANDRA P <em>to the same extent as Offshore Painting. </em>However, neither the hull nor the P &amp; I policy afforded any insurance coverage to Chevron because of its actions as the owner and operator of the offshore production platform. Therefore, the provisions in these policies naming Chevron as an additional assured and waiving subrogation simply do not pertain to Chevron\u2019s acts of negligence as the platform owner.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-4\">Indeed, this court so held, in very similar situations, in <em>Wedlock v. Gulf Mississippi Marine Corp., </em>554 F.2d 240 (5th Cir.1977); and <em>St. Paul Fire &amp; Marine Ins. Co. v. Vest Transportation Co., </em>666 F.2d 932 (5th Cir. 1982). For example, in <em>Wedlock </em>a barge owner (McDermott) chartered a tug boat (owned by DeFelice) to tow its barge, and was named as an additional assured in the marine P &amp; I policy which covered DeFel-ice\u2019s tug boat. When a DeFelice employee was injured <em>while working on McDermott\u2019s barge, </em>McDermott contended \u2014 just as Chevron does in this case \u2014 that it was not liable for its negligence which caused the injury because it was named as an \u201cadditional assured\u201d under DeFelice\u2019s policy. This contention was rejected:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b698-5\">\u201c... DeFelice\u2019s policy covers McDer-mott\u2019s liability only \u2018as respects\u2019 the \u2018covered\u2019 vessel \u2014 here, the Miriam M. DeFel-ice. The Oceana 91 [McDermott\u2019s barge] was not listed as a \u2018covered vessel\u2019 under that policy. That is, the insurance policy does not purport to cover McDermott\u2019s liability for acts of negligence committed <em>qua </em>barge-owner, rather than <em>qua </em>charter.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b698-6\">\u201c... We find nothing in the insurance policy or the record to indicate that by insuring the tug DeFelice\u2019s insurers intended to insure against McDermott\u2019s negligence as a barge-owner.\u201d (554 F.2d at 242-43.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b698-7\">In <em>Wedlock </em>this court also rejected the dicta in <em>Lanasse v. Travelers Ins. Co., </em>450 F.2d at 585, upon which Chevron relies in this case: <em>\u201cLanasse, </em>after all, emphasizes that Chevron could not recover from the insurer of the tug because Chevron\u2019s liability arose <em>qua </em>platform operator rather than <em>qua </em>shipowner (or' charterer). Similarly, McDermott\u2019s liability arose as that of a barge owner, not as an owner or charterer of the covered vessel\u201d (554 F.2d at 244). <em>See also Helaire v. Mobil Oil Co., </em>709 F.2d 1031 (5th Cir.1983) (the words \u201cas owner of the vessel named herein\u201d were deleted from the P &amp; I policy so indemnification was \u201cproper regardless of whether Mobil incurred liability as a \u2018vessel owner\u2019 or as a \u2018platform owner\u2019 \u201d); and <em>Dow Chemical Co. v. TUG \u201cTHOMAS ALLEN,\u201d </em>349 F.Supp. 1354 (E.D.La.1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b698-9\">Although these cases involve marine P &amp; I policies, the reasoning applies equally to a marine hull policy. Here, no liability has been imposed upon Chevron because of the operation of the SANDRA P. Indeed, the jury found that the SANDRA P was not unseaworthy and that neither its owner nor its crew were negligent. Instead, the liability imposed upon Chevron is because of its negligence as the offshore platform owner and operator which caused the explosion. Therefore, Chevron cannot escape this liability by claiming that it is an additional assured, and that subrogation rights have been waived, in the hull policy issued to cover the SANDRA P.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-10\">\n<em>Conclusion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b698-11\">Chevron\u2019s first issue, the denial of its motion for continuance, is based upon a misrepresentation of facts. Neither it nor Chevron\u2019s second issue, the alleged \u201cstatutory violation\u201d by Offshore Painting, was presented to the trial court, so both issues are frivolous. Chevron\u2019s third issue is the same argument, based upon the identical indemnity provision, that Chevron lost before this court eight years ago. Chevron\u2019s final issue, which involves only the amount paid for the loss of the SANDRA P under a .marine hull insurance policy, is without merit. Accordingly, we affirm all of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"615\">*615</page-number>judgments involved in these consolidated appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b689-9\">. The \u201cmaster services agreement\u201d was executed February 9, 1977. It provided that Offshore Painting would perform this work \u201cas an independent contractor\u201d and as requested \u201cfrom time to time\u201d by Chevron.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b689-10\">. On May 31, 1978, pursuant to the master agreement, Chevron issued a Service Order to Offshore Painting for a paint boat and crew and all materials necessary to \u201ctouch-up paint\u201d the compressor piping on Platform A in the West Cameron Block 181 (\u201cPlatform 181-A\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b689-11\">. The compressor for these air lines, which were used to operate paint guns and sandblasters, was located on the SANDRA P.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b689-17\">. At trial, Chevron claimed the ignition was caused by something (perhaps the stove or electrical system) on the SANDRA P, which its attorney described to the jury as a \u201cbucket of rust.\u201d Offshore Painting claimed the source of the ignition was something (perhaps the freezer or the air conditioner) on Chevron\u2019s platform. There was no <em>direct </em>resolution of this conflict\u2014 either by the jury in the trial of the individual claims or by the trial court in its Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law concerning the issues of indemnity and contribution, exoneration and limitation of liability.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b690-9\">. Fontenot also claimed the incident caused him severe \u201cmental\u201d problems because \u201che had been burned very bad when he was twelve.\u201d Fontenot was later committed to a mental institution for a period of time.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b690-10\">. Jurisdiction was based upon the Jones Act, 46 U.S.C. \u00a7 688; the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act, 43 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331; the general maritime law of the United States; and diversity under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b690-11\">. St. Paul Fire &amp; Marine Insurance Company, which provided \u201cumbrella coverage\u201d for Offshore Painting, was also sued by Chevron on these claims.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b690-18\">. First State Insurance Company, the insurance carrier for Herrington, also joined as a plaintiff in this suit \u2014 which was settled before trial with Chevron and Offshore Painting agreeing to pay $22,000 \u201cin the apportionment of their respective liabilities made by final judgment in the pending case of <em>Michael Wiley v. Chevron U.S.A. and Offshore Painting Contractors </em>and consolidated cases,\u201d Accordingly, the only matter in the Herrington case involved in this appeal is the issue of apportionment between Chevron and Offshore Painting.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b691-9\">. At trial, it was disputed whether or not the explosion caused Fontenot to have severe \u201cmental\u201d problems and, if so, whether or not the elective ulcer surgery three days before <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number>trial was related to these problems. <em>See </em>footnote 5.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"AP3\">. Chevron also complained that Fontenot had undergone surgery on the very day of the final pre-trial conference \u2014 contrary to the \u201cunderstanding\u201d at that time that everyone \u201cwas to be advised promptly\u201d if surgery did take place\u2014 but the trial judge rejected this complaint, noting that he \u201cdidn\u2019t feel this was any message from the front.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b692-8\">. Despite this, Chevron attempts to argue\u2014 for the first time on appeal \u2014 that \u201cthe trial judge\u2019s admonitions to the jury were not sufficient precautions against\u201d the risk \u201cthat the jury would consider [Fontenot\u2019s] alleged injuries to be so severe as to prevent his attendance at trial.\u201d If this is intended to be an argument for reversal, this issue is not properly before us since it was not presented to the district court. <em>Shingleton v. Armor Velvet Corp., </em>621 F.2d 180, 183 (5th Cir.1980); May-berry v. <em>Davis, </em>608 F.2d 1070, 1071-72 (5th Cir.1979).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b692-14\">. Fontenot was not even listed as one of Chevron\u2019s witnesses in the Pre-Trial Order. In fact, Fontenot\u2019s attorney did not list his client as a witness; the plaintiff Wiley listed Fontenot only as a possible witness; and Offshore Painting listed Fontenot as a witness only for purposes of cross-examination.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b692-15\">. Actually, Chevron\u2019s brief states that Fonten-ot \u201cthen testified [during his deposition] that while working on the pressure valve [on the bulk separator] he slipped and broke the valve.\u201d This statement is also false. The deposition contains no such testimony. Although this was pointed out in the brief of Offshore Painting, there was no correction \u2014 or even any attempted explanation \u2014 made in the reply brief filed by Chevron.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b693-10\">. There is a single reference to 46 U.S.C. \u00a7 404 in the \u201cStatement of Reasons\u201d filed by Chevron in support of its motion for new trial. However, it appears (or, rather, is hidden) in an argument about the alleged negligence of plaintiffs Wiley, Windham and Fontenot \u2014 and there is no mention of \u201cthe Pennsylvania Rule\u201d and no citation of the <em>E. Madison Hail </em>and <em>Dear-</em>born opinions \u2014 so this isolated reference did not present the trial court with the claims Chevron now makes on appeal. See <em>Thezan v. Maritime Overseas Corp., </em>708 F.2d 175 (5th Cir, 1983). <em>See also Flannery v. Carroll, </em>676 F.2d 126 (5th Cir.1982) (claim not listed in pretrial order is waived).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b694-6\">. See <em>United States v. THE REEFER KING, </em>90 F.Supp. 236 (W.D.Wash.1950).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b694-7\">. In addition, as discussed in the next section of this opinion, both the jury and the trial judge found that the plaintiff Wiley was not negligent in docking the SANDRA P. Thus, even if \u201cthe Pennsylvania Rule\u201d applied, the evidence established that the absence of a licensed pilot on the paint boat was not a contributing cause of the explosion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b694-8\">. Chevron was also unsuccessful before this court in attempting to obtain indemnity where its negligence was the sole cause of the accident, <em>Chevron Oil Co. v. E.D. Walton Constr. Co., Inc., </em>517 F.2d 1119, 1121 (5th Cir.1975); <em>Lanasse v. Travelers Ins. Co., </em>450 F.2d 580, 583-84 (5th Cir.1971), and where the accident was caused by the concurrent negligence of Chevron and its independent contractor, <em>Cole v. Chevron Chemical Co., </em>477 F.2d 361, 367-69 (5th Cir.1973). The contract provisions involved in these decisions were similar, but not identical, to the indemnity provision in the present case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b694-13\">. Actually, Chevron\u2019s \u201cStatement of Issues\u201d in this appeal attack only the findings made by the trial court concerning \u201climitation of liability and exoneration\u201d and \u201cindemnity and contribution.\u201d There is no direct attack upon the findings made by the jury in the trial of the individual cases, although Chevron cavalierly asserts \u2014 once in its Original Brief (p. 26), three times in its Reply Brief (pp. 6, 9, 12) \u2014 that the jury\u2019s findings that Offshore Painting and Wiley were not at fault are \u201cincorrect\u201d and are \u201cclearly erroneous.\u201d We are not favored by Chevron with any analysis of what the results would be if the findings of the trial court were set aside, but the unattacked findings of the jury were left intact.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b695-8\">. <em>Hyde v. Chevron </em>was decided after the oral argument in this case. However, Chevron raised this issue (albeit only in its Reply Brief) by citing a case relied upon in <em>Hyde </em>\u2014 Polozola <em>v. Garlock, Inc., </em>376 So.2d 1009 (La.App. 1st Cir.1979), <em>cert, denied, </em>379 So.2d 1103 (La. 1980) \u2014 as well as <em>Daigle v.
