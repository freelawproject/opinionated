As part of the United States response to the situation in Poland, CCC, guarantor of certain debts Poland owed to United States creditors, consummated agreements with the creditors to assume the debts immediately, on condition that the creditors not declare Poland in default. Capital, an organization whose mission involves monitoring agencies engaged in economic regulation, commenced this lawsuit to invalidate CCC\u2019s action.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-7\">Capital claims no material interest in the Polish debt situation, no substantive rights under the statutory charter or regulations of CCC, and no injury as a result of the end-product of CCC\u2019s action. Instead, Capital alleges deprivation of a procedural right. CCC\u2019s regulations required creditors to declare their debtors in default before turning to CCC for payment. But CCC\u2019s agreements to acquire Poland\u2019s debts required the precise opposite: the creditors were to refrain from declaring Poland in default. The default declaration requirements could be abandoned, Capital maintains, only through rulemaking governed by the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 553, attended by public notice and comment. Had CCC proceeded that way, Capital asserts, Capital would have submitted comments in an effort to influence the agency\u2019s course. Alleging as its injury denial of the opportunity to comment, Capital seeks a court decree that CCC impermissi-bly altered its payment procedures and must follow the rules prescribed in its published regulations until those rules are properly amended.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-12\">The district court dismissed Capital\u2019s complaint for lack of standing. <em>Capital Legal Foundation v. Commodity Credit Corporation, </em>No. 82-00398 (D.D.C. Mar. 19,1982), Joint Appendix (J.A.) 46-61 [hereafter District Court Opinion]. We affirm the district court\u2019s judgment. Although it claims a vibrant interest in commenting prior to agency action, Capital concedes it is not governed, adversely affected, or aggrieved by the substance of the agency decision it seeks to reopen. In essence, Capital first asserts that CCC has violated published regulations, it then labels the asserted violation a rulemaking unattended by public notice and comment. A substantive action taken by the agency is thus described by Capital as a flawed procedural move. We hold that characterization of this order will not do to qualify Capital as a party positioned to overturn CCC\u2019s action.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-13\">I. Background</p>\n<p id=\"AQp\">A. <em>CCC and the Polish Debts</em></p>\n<p id=\"b339-14\">CCC is a federally chartered corporation that operates within the Department of Agriculture.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> One of its functions is to promote development of foreign markets for, and export sales of, U.S. agricultural products. 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 714c(f). CCC runs two agricultural exports payment guarantee programs, the \u201cNoncommercial Risk Assurance Program,\u201d and the \u201cExport Credit Guarantee Program.\u201d These two programs, while they insure against different risks, are almost identical in design and operation. Under both programs CCC contracts to guarantee credits extended to foreign purchasers by U.S. agricultural exporters. Through the guarantee contracts, risks that the purchaser will fail to pay are transferred from U.S. exporters and their financing institutions to CCC. CCC\u2019s guarantees cover foreign defaults occasioned by both \u201cpolitical\u201d (noncommercial) and \u201ccommercial\u201d factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>Two sets of regulations govern CCC\u2019s administration of the agricultural exports payment guarantee programs. 7 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 1487.1 \u2014 .15; 7 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 1493.1-.15. These regulations were promulgated, after notice and comment (informal rulemaking) proceedings, in January 1978 and October 1980.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> They detail the procedures a U.S. creditor .is to follow, upon default by a foreign debtor, in securing payment under CCC\u2019s guarantee. If a foreign payment is not received when due, the creditor is promptly to provide CCC with a \u201cnotice of default,\u201d and within thirty days thereafter file a \u201cclaim for loss.\u201d 7 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 1487.8, 1493.8. \u201cUpon receipt of th[is] information\u201d CCC \u201cshall determine whether or not a loss has occurred for which CCC is liable....\u201d 7 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 1487.9(a), 1493.9(a). Following a liability determination, CCC remits to the U.S. creditor the amount of the loss covered by the guarantee contract. CCC is then subrogated to the right to payment from the foreign debtor. 7 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 1487.9(d), 1493.8(b)(3)(iv).</p>\n<p id=\"b340-5\">Under these export encouragement programs CCC guaranteed about $800 million of debt owed by Poland to U.S. banks and exporters.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> On December 13, 1981, the Government of Poland declared martial law within that country. By early 1982, Poland was unable to pay western creditors; overdue amounts included about $71 million owed under sales contracts guaranteed by CCC. District Court Opinion at 5, J.A. 50.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-10\">Several strategies developed in this country in response to the Polish economic and political situation. One of them was for the United States to purchase debts owed by Poland to U.S. creditors. The large debt so consolidated was to be used as an economic lever to further United States foreign policy goals. District Court Opinion at 6-7, J.A. 51-52<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b340-11\">Accordingly, at the end of January 1982, CCC contacted ten banks and two exporters whose claims against Polish entities were guaranteed by CCC. CCC offered to assume at once outstanding CCC-guaranteed obligations of Poland to these twelve creditors. To accept the offer the creditors had to agree, contrary to CCC\u2019s regulations, to refrain from filing a notice of default on the payments then overdue. The Government so specified in the belief that informal pressure for repayment would better serve United States foreign policy objectives than would formal declarations of default. <em>Id. </em>All twelve creditors who received the January 1982 offer accepted it. Brief for Appel-lees at 6 n. 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-12\">B. <em>Capital\u2019s Complaint</em></p>\n<p id=\"A1\">Capital is a non-profit law firm that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AkX\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>regularly monitors federal activity related to economic regulation, informs members of the public and press about these activities, participates in agency rulemak-ing and, upon request, in the legislative process.... Capital has focussed special attention on the Department of Agriculture. ... Capital\u2019s business ... is, in part, to participate in governmental proceedings in order to present alternative views that would otherwise remain unrepresented ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b341-4\">Brief for the Appellant at 12; Capital Complaint, J.A. 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-5\">Following CCC\u2019s January 1982 offer, Capital brought suit in the district court, alleging that CCC had \u201ceffectively amended its regulations, in violation of Capital\u2019s rights to notice and comment under the [APA].\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1-2. CCC\u2019s offer to the twelve creditors, Capital asserted, constituted <em>\u201cde facto </em>rulemaking\u201d in that it reduced the information the regulations required the creditors to submit and \u201csignificantly omit[ted] the requirement that the banks file a notice of default and certify that payment has not been received.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-6\">In support of its claim Capital cited APA subsections 553(b) and (c), which provide that when an agency engages in informal rulemaking it must give notice and afford \u201cinterested persons\u201d an opportunity to comment.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>Capital contended it had been injured by CCC\u2019s abandonment of the default declaration rules without conducting an APA-govemed rulemaking \u201cin that [Capital\u2019s] task of informing the public about the economic impact of proposed regulatory changes and providing appropriate, responsive comments to the CCC ha[d] been jeopardized.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Capital further described as its injury \u201cdepriv[ation] of the opportunity of having its comments ... fairly considered before CCC reache[d] its final decision.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 10-11. While Capital credibly maintains that it would have commented had CCC tested through rulemak-ing the proposal to purchase the outstanding Polish debt, Brief for the Appellant at 12, Capital readily concedes that it has suffered no injury stemming from the substance of CCC\u2019s offer to the banks and exporters.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b341-13\">Capital sought in the district court (1) a declaration that CCC\u2019s January 1982 offer was \u201cunlawful and therefore invalid\u201d; (2) \u201c[a]n injunction against further CCC action under the repurchase plan\u201d; and (3) a writ of mandamus directed to the appropriate CCC official \u201crequiring his compliance with the public notice and comment provisions of the Administrative Procedure Act prior to taking any action with respect to the assumption of debts owed by Poland.\u201d Capital Complaint, J.A. ll.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b341-14\">C. <em>District Court Decision</em></p>\n<p id=\"AEf\">The district court granted CCC\u2019s motion to dismiss; it reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b341-15\">[T]he CCC\u2019s offer of repurchase, even if a violation of applicable regulations or a de facto rulemaking in contravention of the procedural requirements of the APA, threatens [Capital] with no palpable inju<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>ry, either economic or otherwise. The Court cannot accept Capital\u2019s argument that because Capital asserts a specialized interest in the subject of federal economic regulation, Capital ... has standing to challenge on procedural grounds a CCC decision that has absolutely no effect, economic or otherwise, on Capital.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b342-4\">... Without alleging some palpable injury incurred as a result of the violation of its purported procedural rights, Capital cannot meet the test for standing under the APA ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b342-5\">District Court Opinion at 14-15, J.A. 59-60.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b342-6\">II. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b342-7\">A party who would complain that agency action has violated the Constitution, a statute, or a regulation, must be adversely affected by that action. A sincere, vigorous interest in the action challenged, or in the provisions of law allegedly violated, will not do to establish standing if the party\u2019s interest is purely ideological, uncoupled from any injury in fact, or tied only to an undifferentiated injury common to all members of the public. <em>Frothingham v. Mellon, </em>262 U.S. 447, 43 S.Ct. 597, 67 L.Ed. 1078 (1923), applied this rule to deny standing to a plaintiff-taxpayer who challenged the constitutionality of a federal appropriation.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> In <em>Sierra Club v. Morton, </em>405 U.S. 727, 92 S.Ct. 1361, 31 L.Ed.2d 636 (1972), the rule operated to deny standing to a plaintiff organization that invoked federal statutes and regulations to challenge agency action not alleged to affect any of the organization\u2019s members.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Injury in fact, caused by the substance of an agency\u2019s action or inaction, is an essential element of a plaintiff\u2019s complaint. The injury need not be large, <em>United States v. Students Challenging Regulatory Agency Procedures (SCRAP), </em>412 U.S. 669, 689 n. 14, 93 S.Ct. 2405, 2417 n. 14, 37 L.Ed.2d 254 (1973), but it must exist and be distinct.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-14\">This is not to say that a party must have a \u201clegal interest\u201d in the agency action challenged. That test for standing had currency at one time, <em>see Tennessee Electric Power Co. v. Tennessee Valley Authority, </em>306 U.S. 118, 137-38, 59 S.Ct. 366, 369-70, 83 L.Ed. 543 (1939), but it has been replaced by the more expansive \u201czone of interests\u201d test. <em>Association of Data Processing Service Organizations v. Camp, </em>397 U.S. 150, 153, 90 S.Ct. 827, 830, 25 L.Ed.2d 184 (1970).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The \u201czone\u201d test is passed if a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>plaintiff\u2019s interest in the agency action appears to fall within the ambit of the constitutional clause,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> statute,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> or regulation allegedly violated. Plaintiff\u2019s interest need only be \u201carguably within the zone of interests to be protected or regulated\u201d by the law under which the claim arises. <em>Id. </em>at 158, 90 S.Ct. at 830.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-4\">In <em>Gull Airborne Instruments, Inc. v. We-inberger, </em>694 F.2d 838 (D.C.Cir.1982), for example, we held that a disappointed bidder on a contract had standing to challenge an agency\u2019s alleged failure to abide by statutes and regulations applicable to contract awards. It was evident that the plaintiff had suffered injury in fact, and that the injury was arguably within the zone of interests of the relevant laws regulating contract awards. In contrast, we held that the same disappointed bidder lacked standing to seek review of the agency\u2019s alleged maladministration of the contract it had awarded. It appeared improbable that the disappointed bidder suffered any additional injury from that maladministration, and even if such injury were assumed, the regulations governing the administration of contracts were designed to protect the government against injury from contractors\u2019 defaults, not to protect the interests of disappointed bidders or other third parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-5\">In sum, to establish standing to challenge an agency\u2019s handling of its affairs a plaintiff must plausibly (1) allege injury in fact derived from the agency\u2019s action or inaction, and (2) assert that the injury is arguably within the zone of interests protected or regulated by the law on which the complaint is founded. <em>See Consumers Union of United States, Inc. v. Federal Trade Commission, </em>691 F.2d 575, 577 n. 9 (D.C.Cir. 1982) (en banc); <em>Control Data Corp. v. Bal-drige, </em>655 F.2d 283, 288 (D.C.Cir.1981). The standing inquiry focuses on the substance of the agency action, its adverse impact on the plaintiff, and the types of interests that the applicable law is designed to protect. The would-be plaintiff\u2019s interest in the relevant law is ascertained by injury in fact; the law\u2019s interest in the would-be plaintiff is determined by the \u201czone of interests\u201d test. Mutuality of interest must be credibly asserted.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-9\">Despite artful pleading, Capital cannot disguise the essence of its complaint. In its presentation to this court, Capital explained that it \u201csought to enjoin [CCC] from assuming obligations owed by Poland to various American creditors, unless and until [CCC] complies] either with present .. . regulations or with new regulations promulgated in accordance with the APA.\u201d Reply Brief for the Appellant at 2. But Capital is a stranger to CCC\u2019s present regulations in the sense that it is not governed or materially affected by them. <em>See generally </em>Stewart, <em>The Reformation of American Administrative Law, </em>88 Harv.L.Rev. 1667, 1734-47 (1975). Therefore Capital lacks standing, as the foregoing discussion clarifies, to complain to a court that CCC violated current regulations and so should be ordered to conform to them.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-10\">Lacking a stake courts will recognize in CCC\u2019s adherence to its regulations, Capital presses a beguiling argument. CCC\u2019s offer to the banks and exporters would have been lawful, Capital states, if accomplished through a rulemaking governed by the APA. In such a rulemaking, Capital as<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>serts, it would have exercised its APA-created public participation right to comment. That right, Capital seeks to persuade us, is what gives it standing to maintain this action.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-4\">But to arrive at a right to participate in a rulemaking, Capital must detour around the charge it made at the outset \u2014 that CCC violated current regulations, a charge Capital may not complain of in court. Capital attempts the detour by stating it \u201calleged ... that CCC had violated its regulations only in order to aid in a showing that what occurred here was rulemaking, although not in accord with the APA.\u201d Reply Brief for the Appellant at 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-5\">We take it that Capital is saying: first, there would have been no violation if CCC had a rule that allowed it to direct or invite creditors not to declare Poland in default; seeond, instead of viewing CCC as a regulation violator,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> we should regard the agency as having amended its rules to conform them to its conduct; third, we should recognize that the supposed amendment was improperly promulgated (\u201cnot in accord with the APA\u201d) because Capital received no notice of it<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> or opportunity to comment.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-14\">This strikes us as a good deal of make believe. Were we to accept Capital\u2019s imaginative argument, every asserted violation by an agency of its own regulations could be recharacterized <em>\u201cde facto </em>rulemaking\u201d outside the APA, and therefore arguably open to challenge as procedurally-flawed by any person who claims he, she, or it would have participated had the rulemaking occurred inside the APA.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> We are certain that Congress, in adopting the APA, had no such universal standing design in mind.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b345-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>III.

The legislative history makes it clear that the sole design of this section was to codify federal judge-made standing rules as they existed in 1946:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b344-12\">The Attorney General advised the Senate Committee on the Judiciary of his understanding that section [702(a) ] was a restatement of existing law. More specifically, he indicated his understanding that section [702(a) ] preserved the rules developed by the courts in such cases as <em>Alabama Power Co. v. Ickes, </em>302 U.S. 464 [58 S.Ct. 300, 82 L.Ed. 374] (1938); <em>Massachusetts v.

Sanders Brs. Radio Station, </em>309 U.S. 470 [60 S.Ct. 693, 84 L.Ed. 869] (1940). [Citing S.Doc. 248, <em>infra.] </em>This construction of section [702(a) ] was not questioned or contradicted in the legislative history. [Citing <em>American Stevedores, Inc. v.

(1946). All of the cited cases involved challengers substantively interested in, and adversely affected by, the agency\u2019s product or outcome; none involved a bare claim of a right to input in the agency\u2019s process.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-16\">Commenting on readings of section 702 that would work \u201ca dramatic liberalization of standing in the law as of 1946,\u201d Professors Breyer and Stewart note: \u201cThere is no evidence that Congress contemplated such a change, or that it intended anything more than a codification of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>preexisting judge-made standing law.\u201d S. Breyer &amp; R. Stewart, Administrative Law and Regulatory Policy 931 n. 147 (1979). These commentators acknowledge, however, that the APA has not been perceived by judges as a \u201cstatic codification\u201d; it does not freeze 1946 standing law but affords leeway for continuing reasoned development \u201cin accordance with current perceptions and needs.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 922.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
