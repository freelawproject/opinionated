The court sentenced Clinton to three concurrent terms of two years\u2019 probation with the condition that he make restitution to the United States in the amount of $1,750. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-17\">I. <em>Background</em></p>\n<p id=\"b200-18\">On June 5, 1981, Raul Guerrero, Special Agent of the United States Department of Agriculture, met with Clinton at Clinton\u2019s place of business, Kong\u2019s Stock Market Bar, in Davenport, Iowa. Guerrero told Clinton that he had food stamps to sell. The two men discussed price, and Guerrero left a $50 book of stamps with Clinton. On three subsequent occasions, Clinton purchased over a hundred dollars worth of food stamps from Guerrero.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b200-19\">At trial, Clinton admitted making the three purchases, but raised the defense of entrapment. The jury found Clinton guilty on all three counts. Following the district court\u2019s denial of Clinton\u2019s posttrial motion to vacate the jury\u2019s verdict, Clinton brought this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-20\">II. <em>Discussion.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b200-21\">Clinton contends on appeal that the district court committed prejudicial error in failing to grant a mistrial at several points during the course of the trial. First, Clinton argues that prosecutorial misconduct prejudiced the jury and denied him a fair trial. This allegation centers on a question <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>the prosecutor asked Special Agent Guerrero:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b201-5\">[Prosecutor]: Now, Agent Guerrero, did you have \u2014 receive information from which you had reason to believe that Hubert Clinton might be involved in\u2014</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ast\">At this point, Clinton\u2019s attorney objected to the prosecutor\u2019s question. The district court sustained defense counsel\u2019s objection, but denied a motion for mistrial in the following exchange:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b201-6\">[Defense attorney]: Object to this and ask\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b201-7\">The Court: The objection is sustained.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b201-8\">[Defense attorney]: \u2014and ask for a mistrial. That\u2019s right out of the mouth of the prosecutor. It\u2019s highly improper, prejudicial. I don\u2019t see how the Defendant can possibly get a fair trial now.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b201-9\">The Court: The objection is sustained, and the Jury will be instructed to disregard the question that was in the process of being posed. And the motion for mistrial will be denied.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b201-10\">Clinton argues that the prosecutor\u2019s question tainted the jury\u2019s consideration implying that Clinton had previously been involved in food stamp trafficking. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-11\">The district court has broad discretion in determining whether an improper question has so tainted the trial as to require a mistrial. <em>United States v. Elliott, </em>674 F.2d 754, 755 (8th Cir.1982). In the instant case, the question, which the Government concedes to have been improper, occurred early in the trial, immediately after Guerrero had explained in general terms the Government\u2019s efforts to investigate the misuse of food stamps. The prosecutor\u2019s question represented an inartful attempt to narrow the inquiry to Clinton\u2019s specific acts. The prosecutor never completed the question, and Guerrero never answered. Given all these factors, and given the strength of the Government\u2019s case against the defendant, we conclude the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Clinton\u2019s motion for mistrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-12\">Clinton\u2019s remaining allegations of error also arise from Special Agent Guerrero\u2019s testimony. Guerrero testified about the meeting at which Clinton made his first purchase of food stamps as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b201-13\">[Prosecutor]: Did Mr. Clinton then travel to the Clayton House and meet with you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b201-14\">[Guerrero]: Yes, sir. He arrived approximately around 1800 hours, which is around 6:00 p.m., that afternoon. He entered the Why-Not Bar, and he was accompanied by a white female who he identified to me as Kathy.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b201-15\">[Prosecutor]: Did you have a conversation with Mr. Clinton?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b201-16\">[Guerrero]: Yes, I did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b201-17\">[Prosecutor]: What was the nature of that conversation?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b201-18\">[Guerrero]: ... He says, \u201cI\u2019m kind of in a hurry. I\u2019ve got business. I\u2019ve got to take Kathy to a business appointment.\u201d I said, \u201cOh, that\u2019s fine.\u201d He said, \u201cI\u2019m kind of in a hurry.\u201d ...</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b201-19\">In addition, Guerreno later testified about Clinton\u2019s third purchase of food stamps:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b201-20\">[Prosecutor]: Was there any other conversation or discussion?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b201-21\">[Guerrero]: He asked me what else I\u2019d be interested in, if I would be interested in some property. I said, \u201cWhat kind of property?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b201-22\">[Defense attorney]: I\u2019m going to object to this and, again, about Clinton\u2019s third purchase of food stamps:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b201-23\">[Prosecutor]: Was there any other conversation or discussion?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b201-24\">[Guerrero]: He asked me what else I\u2019d be interested in, if I would be interested in some property. I said, \u201cWhat kind of property?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b201-25\">[Defense attorney]: I\u2019m going to object to this and, again, I\u2019m going to ask for a mistrial. It\u2019s irrelevant to these charges. The prosecutor knows better; if he doesn\u2019t know better, then he ought to be taught better.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b202-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>All he\u2019s trying to do is prejudice the defendant, and this evidence is\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b202-4\">The Court: The question has, so far \u2014 Unless you put it in, Mr. Malvik,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b202-5\">[Defense attorney]: the question so far doesn\u2019t give the Court any indication.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b202-6\">The Court: Counsel, approach the bench, please.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b202-7\">Clinton contends that these statements constitute inadmissible evidence of other crimes. He alleges that the first incident points a picture of him as \u201ca law-breaking stereotypical black man pimping for his white prostitute,\u201d and that the second incident implies that he traffics in stolen property.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-8\">The district court concluded that the testimony, while extraneous, was not so prejudicial as to justify a mistrial. We agree, and conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Clinton\u2019s motions for mistrial. Depending on the demeanor and voice inflection of the witness, both incidents involved testimony subject to varying interpretations. The district court was in the best position to determine prejudicial impact, if any. <em>United States v. Elliott, supra, </em>674 F.2d at 755.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-9\">III. <em>Conclusion.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b202-10\">Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b200-12\">. The Honorable William C. Stuart, Chief Judge of the United States District Court for the Southern District of Iowa.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b200-13\">. On June 25, 1981 Clinton purchased $500 worth of food stamps from Guerrero, paying $200. On September 18, 1981, Clinton purchased $1,500 worth of food stamps from Guerrero, paying $600. Finally, on January 26, 1982 Clinton purchased $1,000 worth of food stamps for $450.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
