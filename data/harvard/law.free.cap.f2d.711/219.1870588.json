(\u201cRRD\u201d) of a small power production facility and to its filing of initial energy rates for the facility under provisions of the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act (PURPA). FPL contends that RRD\u2019s claims to qualifying status and resulting rate payments by FPL under PURPA conflict with \u201cpreexisting contractual arrangements which obligate RRD to surrender possession of the [facility] upon completion of construction and which entitle FPL to acquire the energy produced ... on terms specified by contract.\u201d Brief for Petitioner at 1-2. RRD\u2019s contractual obligations are currently the subject of state court proceedings. The Commission declined to consider FPL\u2019s challenges pending resolution of those proceedings. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-6\">Resource Recovery (Dade County) Construction Corporation (\u201cRRDC\u201d) and Dade County, Florida entered into contracts which called on RRDC to construct facilities capable of producing steam from processed solid waste and generating electricity from the steam.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On completion of construction, title to the waste processing facility and the electrical generating facility were to pass to the County. By contract between the County and FPL, title to the electrical generating facility was to be transfered to FPL. RRD was to operate the processing facility and sell steam to FPL at specified prices.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-13\">But contractual disputes arose between the County and RRDC during construction. The substance of these disputes was eventually referred to arbitration.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Pending resolution RRDC continued to construct the facilities. On completion RRDC refused to transfer title and RRD assumed their operation.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-14\">On March 13, 1981 RRD filed a Notice of Qualification for a small power production facility. RRD\u2019s notice stated that it was the owner and operator of a resource recovery facility which met all the criteria necessary to satisfy the Commission\u2019s self-certification regulation for small power production facilities. <em>See </em>18 C.F.R. \u00a7 292.207(a). This notice filing entitled RRD to specific benefits under PURPA. <em>See </em>16 U.S.C. \u00a7 824a-3. Most importantly, it required electric utilities \u2014 in this ease FPL \u2014 to purchase energy from the qualifying small power production facility at favorable rates. 16 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 824a-3(a)(2), 3(b). Following RRD\u2019s filing of a Notice of Qualification, it filed with the Commission a schedule of electric energy rates based on FPL\u2019s full avoided costs.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b306-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>FPL filed petitions with the Commission protesting RRD\u2019s notice and proposed rates. FPL argued that RRD\u2019s qualifying notice was inconsistent with its contractual obligations to relinquish ownership of the electric generating facility and to provide steam at agreed upon rates. FPL also asserted that the uncertainty of RRD\u2019s obligations required it to obtain a formal determination of its qualifying status pursuant to 18 C.F.R. \u00a7 292.207(b) rather than merely claim that status through the self-certification process under \u00a7 292.207(a). Finally, FPL argued that even if RRD is entitled to qualifying status, its proposed rates conflict with this court\u2019s decision in <em>American Elec., Etc. v. Federal Energy Reg., </em>675 F.2d 1226 (D.C.Cir.1982), <em>rev\u2019d, </em>- U.S. -, 103 S.Ct. 1921, 76 L.Ed.2d 22 (1983), and FPL\u2019s pending state court challenge to the valuation of FPL\u2019s full avoided costs. <em>See </em>note 3 <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b306-6\">In a series of orders, the Commission rejected each of these arguments. As to FPL\u2019s contention that RRD\u2019s qualification notice was inconsistent with its contractual obligations, the Commission declined \u201cto sift through the competing claims of the parties to determine, under state contract law, who is the rightful owner or operator of the facility.\u201d Appendix at 4. The Commission ruled that these commercial issues \u201cshould be resolved in the state forum of competent jurisdiction.\u201d <em>Id. </em>On rehearing, the Commission stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b306-7\">[T]he issue of who owns the facility is currently being decided in a state forum of competent jurisdiction. Under the circumstances of this case, we are not inclined to interfere with the state court\u2019s consideration of state contract principles. FPL has the opportunity to seek revocation of RRD\u2019s qualifying status if the commercial dispute is resolved in its favor. In the interim, we perceive no irreparable harm accruing to FPL. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>Implicit in such a condition is our conclusion that the FPSC rates may not ultimately be found to be just and reasonable, depending on the outcome of the court proceedings. Thus, refunds may be ordered of any amounts in excess of what is ultimately determined to be the just and reasonable rate.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b306-8\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number><em>Id. </em>at 9. The Commission also declined to upset RRD\u2019s \u00a7 292.207(a) self-certification on the basis of a \u201csubstantive commercial dispute,\u201d observing that FPL would have an opportunity to seek revocation of RRD\u2019s qualifying status when \u201cthe commercial dispute is resolved.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-11\">As to RRD\u2019s rate filing, the Commission found the rates just and reasonable, and made them effective subject to possible refund in the event of a final adverse ruling in <em>American Electric </em>or state court proceedings.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The Commission declined, on rehearing, to require a surety bond from RRD, indicating that such a requirement would be inappropriate where based principally upon a state-law contract dispute, and would, in any event, be contrary to traditional practice.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-12\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-13\">By petition for review, FPL raises two principal objections to the Commission\u2019s refusal to disturb RRD\u2019s claim to self-qualifying status pursuant to \u00a7 292.207(a). First, FPL contends that the Commission is required to examine whether the claim to qualifying status conflicts with RRD\u2019s contractual obligations by Supreme Court doctrine announced in <em>United Gas Pipeline Co. </em>v. <em>Mobile Gas Service Corp., </em>350 U.S. 332, 76 S.Ct. 373, 100 L.Ed. 373 (1956), and <em>FPC v. Sierra Pacific Power Co., </em>350 U.S. 348, 76 S.Ct. 368, 100 L.Ed. 388 (1956). Second, FPL contends that a dispute over ownership of a facility prevents self-certification under the Commission\u2019s own procedures. We find no merit in either objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-14\">The <em>Mobile-Sierra </em>doctrine prohibits the Commission from accepting a new rate filing as lawful under the Federal Power Act where unilaterally submitted by a party contractually committed to a different rate. This doctrine has no application, however, to RRD\u2019s claim to qualifying status under \u00a7 292.207(a). Unlike a rate approval under the Federal Power Act, a claim to qualifying status under \u00a7 292.207(a) requires no review by the Commission. By regulation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>RRD is entitled to seek qualifying status for a facility so long as it is the owner or operator and meets the basic criteria of \u00a7 292.203. FPL argues the RRD is not legally the owner or operator under the terms of its contract with the County, but in fact RRD presently operates the facility at issue. Although indicating its willingness to reconsider the matter in the event ownership or operation of the facility should change following state court resolution of the contract dispute, the Commission refused to disturb RRD\u2019s facially valid self-certification of its facility. We find this a proper exercise of the Commission\u2019s discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-5\">Nor do we find the Commission\u2019s acceptance of RRD\u2019s initial rate filing in violation of this circuit\u2019s decision in <em>City of Cleveland, Ohio v. FPC, </em>525 F.2d 845 (D.C. Cir.1976) (requiring adjudication of claim that utility\u2019s rate filing is in conflict with contractual rates). Unlike that case the Commission does not purport to accept the rates as just and reasonable, but rather conditions its \u201cacceptance of RRD\u2019s rates [as approved by FPSC] on an agreement to make them subject to refund pending outcome of [state court] proceedings.\u201d Appendix at 22; <em>see </em>note 3 <em>supra. </em>The Commission went on to explain:</p>\n<p id=\"b307-7\"><em>Id. </em>In our view the Commission is denying FPL neither adjudication of its dispute over rates, albeit initially in a state forum, or eventual review before the Commission.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b307-10\">FPL also contends that the Commission\u2019s refusal to examine RRD\u2019s contractual right to operation of the facility, in light of FPL\u2019s protest, was contrary to the Commission\u2019s own procedures. We find no departure from past practice. FPL refers us to an earlier statement by the Commission suggesting that in \u201cquestionable\u201d cases the formal application procedure for qualification under \u00a7 292.207(b) should be used rather than the \u00a7 292.207(a) self-certification procedure. But the language of \u00a7 292.207 and the Commission\u2019s own interpretation suggests that the choice of which certification procedure to follow is left to the applicant. Even if FPL is correct in asserting that a formal determination of qualification is required in questionable cases, the Commission observed that \u201cpending some change in the operation of the facility, [the Commission has] no grounds on which to question the self-certification of [RRD].\u201d Appendix at 9. Again we find this reasoning and its implied deference to pending state court proceedings within the agency\u2019s discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-11\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-12\">Assuming the self-certification was proper, FPL argues the Commission nevertheless erred by not requiring RRD to post a surety bond or some other guaranty in the event a refund is later required. This decision appears to fall clearly within the Commission\u2019s broad discretionary power, and we find nothing in this record to disturb its decision.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>See </em>16 U.S.C. 825h (conferring discretionary power on the Commission \u201cto perform any and all acts ... as it may find necessary or appropriate to carry out the provisions of [the Federal Power Act]\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b308-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>For the reasons stated, the decisions of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission are AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b305-7\">. RRDC and RRD are both wholly-owned subsidiaries of Parsons &amp; Whittemore, Inc., \u201ca corporation engaged in a variety of industrial activities in the United States\u201d and abroad. Brief for Intervenor RRD at 5. RRDC was apparently responsible for construction of the facilities, RRD with their operation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b305-8\">. An arbitration award was issued March 1, 1983 finding both parties had committed breaches, denying damages to either side and purporting to \u201crewrite\u201d the contracts to approximate the parties\u2019 intent (leaving RRD in possession of the facilities and entitling it to charge FPL for energy at PURPA rates prescribed by the Florida Public Service Commission). This award was confirmed by the Circuit Court of the 11th Judicial Circuit for Dade County on March 31, 1983.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b305-15\">. Prior to submitting a rate schedule to the Commission, RRD obtained orders from the Florida Public Service Commission (\u201cFPSC\u201d) requiring FPL to interconnect with the resource recovery facility and pay RRD the avoided costs of its output. FPL disputed the orders before FPSC and on direct appeal to the Florida Supreme Court. On March 17, 1983 the Florida court reversed FPSC\u2019s order calling for payment of FPL\u2019s avoided costs, ruling that FPSC lacked the statutory authority to promulgate cogeneration rules and that it failed to provide FPL a full hearing. <em>Florida Power &amp; Light Co. v. Florida Public Service Commission, </em>No. 60,671 (Fla.S.Ct. March 17, 1983). Motions for rehearing of that decision were filed on April 4, 1983. FPL\u2019s challenge to FPSC\u2019s interconnection order is still pending. <em>Metropolitan Dade County, Florida and Florida Power &amp; Light Co. v. FPSC, </em>No. 61,536 (Fla.S.Ct., argued October 5, 1982).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b306-9\">. RRD indicated its acceptance of this condition in a letter filed with the Commission on April 12, 1982.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b307-8\">. FPL suggests that any later challenge of initially accepted rates may be barred by the \u201cfiled rate doctrine.\u201d See <em>Arkansas Louisiana Gas Co. v. Hall, </em>453 U.S. 571, 573, 101 S.Ct. 2925, 2928, 69 L.Ed.2d 856 (1981). Given the Commission\u2019s conditional acceptance of RRD\u2019s rates, and RRD\u2019s express agreement to abide by the condition, see note 4 <em>supra, </em>we find this an unlikely possibility.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b307-13\">. Indeed, the Commission\u2019s determination that the requirement of posting a bond or providing some other guarantee is contrary to agency tradition is supported by FPL\u2019s failure to find more than two cases to suggest a contrary practice. Brief for FPL at 33 n. 40.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
