SKELLY WRIGHT,</author>\n<p id=\"aqc-dedup-0\">Circuit Judge:</p>\n<p id=\"b476-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>Petitioners, a group of 14 freight forwarding companies,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> challenge a decision of the Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC) to grant U.S. Express, Inc. (Express) authority to operate as a freight forwarder of general commodities, including household goods, between various points in the United States.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The principal legal issue presented by this appeal is whether ICC may grant an unrestricted forwarding permit without requiring separate evidence of the applicant\u2019s fitness to forward household, as well as general, commodities. We conclude that ICC can grant an unrestricted forwarding permit without requiring such evidence. We find, therefore, that ICC\u2019s decision to grant Express unrestricted authority is supported by substantial evidence, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-4\">I. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b476-5\">Freight forwarders perform an intermediary function in the transportation industry. They hold themselves out to the general public to provide transportation of property, to consolidate small shipments, to distribute such shipments, and to assume responsibility for transportation from origin to destination. 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 10102(8) (Supp. V 1981). Freight forwarders, like most intermediaries, mainly provide administrative services: they consolidate small loads, hire common carriers to transport the consolidated loads, and redistribute the small loads at the points of destination. Freight forwarders principally serve corporations and military units \u2014 entities who ship loads of a size that do not justify direct contracting with actual carriers. The freight forwarders make their profits on the differential between the rates paid to carriers and the rates charged to such entities.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-13\">In November 1981 Express applied to ICC for authority to operate as a freight forwarder of general commodities, including household goods,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> between points in the United States. <em>See </em>Application For Freight Forwarder Permit, Joint Appendix (JA) 1-5. Express had operated for many years as an international forwarder using air and ocean carriers, but this was its first application to forward freight by rail, motor, and other domestic carriers. <em>See </em>Verified Statement of Applicant, JA 36. Express supported its application with the statements of ten shippers, all of whom testified as to their need for, and Express\u2019 ability to provide, the proposed service.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b476-14\">Four freight forwarders of general commodities protested Express\u2019 application. In addition, petitioners protested the portion of the application that would allow Express to forward household goods. <em>See </em>Verified Statements and Protest, JA 42, 50-61.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Pe<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>titioners contended that the supporting shippers had not shown a need to move household goods and that Express had not specifically demonstrated that it was fit, willing, and able to forward such goods. <em>Id. </em>at 5-6, 7-10, JA 54-55, 56-59.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-5\">On March 8,1982 a review board appointed by the Commission denied Express\u2019 application in its entirety.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>See </em>Decision of Review Board No. 1 (March 8, 1982), JA 85-88. The review board found that Express had not carried its burden of showing a need for or the ability to provide the proposed service. <em>Id. </em>at 3, JA 87. The board did not discuss or rule on the separate issues that petitioners raised concerning household goods.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-6\">On appeal a division of three Commissioners reversed the initial review board. <em>See </em>Decision of Appellate Division 2 (May 17, 1982), JA 135-139. The appellate division found that the evidence of record \u201cis sufficiently representative to establish that the broad forwarding service that applicant proposes is required by the shipping public.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2-3, JA 136-137. Moreover, the division rejected petitioners\u2019 request that the grant be restricted against the forwarding of household goods. <em>Id. </em>at 3, JA 137. The appellate division found no ICC precedent or policy requiring such an imposition, and concluded that petitioners have not successfully established that they would be materially harmed by Express\u2019 added competition. <em>Id. </em>at 2-3, JA 136-137.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-7\">On May 17, 1982 petitioners requested that the full Commission reconsider Express\u2019 application. <em>See </em>Protestants Petition for Administrative Review 1-17, JA 141-158. They argued that the division\u2019s decision was inconsistent with current ICC policy that restricts the certification of <em>motor carriers </em>against the carriage of household goods where there has been no separate showing of fitness to move such commodities. <em>Id. </em>at 5-6, JA 146-147.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> They also noted that ICC had recently restricted the permit of a freight forwarder against the forwarding of household goods. <em>Id. </em>at 7-10, JA 148-151.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b477-14\">On July 7, 1982 the full Commission denied the request for discretionary review. <em>See </em>Commission Decision 1-2 (July 7,1982), JA 170-171. The Commission stated that the policy restricting certificates of motor carriers against household goods transportation was properly limited to motor carriers and would not be extended to freight forwarders:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b477-15\">The [household goods] exclusion is premised on the fitness issues that might arise because of differences in the carriage of general commodities as opposed to the transporting of household goods. These are primarily operational rather than administrative and do not apply with equal force to the business of forwarding. * * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b477-16\"><em>Id. </em>at 2, JA 171. Furthermore, it decided that the examination of the fitness of household goods forwarders is of \u201cdiminished importance in light of the statutory exemption for freight forwarder transportation of \u2018used household goods.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id.</em><footnotemark><em>9</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Fi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>nally, the Commission expressly overruled any past decisions in which it had restricted the permit of a freight forwarder against the forwarding of household goods:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b478-4\">Having considered the issue in full detail, we now believe that an extension of the [household goods exclusion] is unwarranted and inconsistent with a statutory mandate to promote competition and eliminate unproductive regulation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b478-5\"><em>Id. </em>The Commission then concluded that restricting the permits of freight forwarders would unnecessarily \u201cfrustrate forwarders from holding out a full range of service to the public.\u201d <em>Id.</em><footnotemark><em>10</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"azp-dedup-0\">Petitioners then filed this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-6\">II. Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b478-7\">To grant a freight forwarding permit ICC must find both that the public needs and that the applicant can provide the proposed forwarding service. 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 10923(a). In this case ICC determined that Express\u2019 application met these criteria and that it was \u201cconsistent with the public interest and the national transportation policy.\u201d <em>See </em>Decision of Appellate Division 2, <em>supra, </em>at 4, JA 138. The ten shippers\u2019 statements, together with the evidence in Express\u2019 application, adequately support this determination.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Therefore, ICC was justified in making the general grant of authority.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b478-11\">Petitioners\u2019 principal complaint is not with ICC\u2019s grant of \u201cgeneral\u201d authority to Express, but rather with ICC\u2019s unwillingness to restrict that grant against the forwarding of household goods. They complain that ICC acts arbitrarily and capriciously when it allows a freight forwarder to forward household commodities without offering any specific evidence about the public\u2019s need for, or Express\u2019 ability to provide, the household goods service. <em>See </em>brief for petitioners at 12-13. But we think that ICC has permissibly determined and fully explained that a separate demonstration of this type is not essential to the granting of a freight forwarding permit. <em>See </em>Decision of Appellate Division 2, <em>supra, </em>at 2-3, JA 136-137.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-12\">To begin with, ICC has reasonably concluded that, in contrast to the actual transporting of household goods by common carriers, the forwarding of household goods does not require special skills or separate demonstrations of fitness. Freight forwarders do not provide the actual transportation of household goods; licensed motor carriers do.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Freight forwarders merely assume the role of shipper; at all times common carriers, subject to requisite fitness showings, provide the actual transportation. Apparently, the only special skill a freight forwarder must have is the ability to choose reputable common carriers. Express, a forwarder with years of experience in hiring the services of air and ocean carriers, clear<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>ly should know how to hire reputable common carriers.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b479-5\">Second, ICC has thoughtfully noted that freight forwarders, unlike household goods motor carriers, are not governed by special legislation or regulation. There are no special statutory requirements for freight forwarders of household goods,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> whereas common carriers are subject to many.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Indeed, when Congress recently singled out household goods motor carriers for special legislative treatment, it did not mention or express any concern about household goods freight forwarders.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Likewise, while ICC has historically imposed special regulations on household goods carriers, it has always treated freight forwarders less restrictively.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> ICC requires only that freight forwarders advise shippers of the Commission\u2019s jurisdiction and of whom to contact at the Commission for information or assistance.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b479-6\">Finally, ICC has persuasively argued that requiring applicants to make special showings of fitness to forward household goods would unnecessarily reduce competition in the industry.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Requiring only a general demonstration of fitness allows those who are so certified to provide a wider range of forwarding services, and thereby to increase the choices available to shippers and the competition among forwarders.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> By contrast, requiring applicants to show their fitness to forward household goods would erect a barrier to entry into the industry, thereby reducing the services available to shippers and insulating existing forwarders from new competition.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-12\">In sum, ICC had substantial evidence on which to determine Express\u2019 fitness, willingness, and ability to forward all commodities, including household goods. ICC\u2019s decision not to restrict Express\u2019 permit against the forwarding of household goods was a reasonable exercise of its discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-13\">III. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b479-14\">Once an applicant demonstrates its fitness to provide the proposed forwarding service, ICC will grant the permit unless the protesting forwarders show that they will be materially harmed by the new competition. <em>Smith World-Wide Movers, Inc., Freight Forwarder Application, </em>337 ICC 721, 737 (1970). Here, ICC determined that Express\u2019 competition would not materially affect petitioners and that its entrance into the industry would promote efficiency and consumer choice. <em>See </em>Decision of Appellate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>Division 2, <em>supra, </em>at 3-4, JA 137-138. Having made all the findings required of it, ICC approved the Express application. Accordingly, the Commission\u2019s decision is</p>\n<p id=\"A_D\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b476-6\">.

The Fifth Circuit was impressed by ICC\u2019s historic regulation of motor carrier transport of household goods and was concerned that, without a special showing, ICC would be unable to enforce recent enactments of Congress designed to protect consumers in the transport of household goods. <em>Id. </em>at 465-467.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b477-18\">. <em>See Atlas Consolidated Container, Inc., Freight Forwarder Application, </em>ICC Docket No. FF-573 (May 10, 1982), <em>reprinted in </em>Appendix B of brief for petitioners.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b477-19\">. <em>See </em>49 U.S.C. \u00a7 10562(2)(D).
