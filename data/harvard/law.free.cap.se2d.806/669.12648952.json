Hall's wife had a colonoscopy scheduled for February 14, 2014, and Hall called her doctor the night before or early that morning to confirm that the doctor would be there. The morning of February 14, Hall drove his wife to St. Joseph's and let her out in front of the hospital's main lobby. Hall then drove to the east visitor parking deck, where he had been many times before, entering the deck at approximately 8:45 a.m. The deck has two levels-the upper, uncovered level, where the entrance is located, and the lower, covered level, where the exit is located. Hall drove into the deck on the upper, uncovered level, where he parked between two cars. He was not aware of any ice on the pavement of the parking deck as he drove into the deck, but deposed, \"[t]hat's not to say there was none there.\" When Hall opened his car door, he did not look for ice or snow before exiting his car, and took approximately three steps before falling on invisible or black ice. He did not see the ice before he fell. Hall sustained injuries to his elbow and shoulder from the fall.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   After his fall, Hall was taken to St. Joseph's emergency room. One of the emergency medical technicians who responded to the scene deposed that she had trouble with her footing between the ambulance and Hall's car. Footage from a surveillance camera in the parking deck, taken shortly after Hall's fall, shows Hall sitting on the ground near his car. The footage also shows that visible ice and snow remained under and around some of the parked cars and around dividers in and outside the parking area, but not in the area where Hall was sitting.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   As a general rule, St. Joseph's security officers patrol the visitor parking deck every two hours, with their primary role being to provide security. During inclement weather conditions, the security officers will also look for snow and ice and communicate information about any ice patches they discover to the engineering department. When they discover an ice patch, the officers are trained to wait until engineering arrives to determine what needs to be done. The week of February 10, 2014 was considered a winter weather event at St. Joseph's, and during such an event, employees are not allowed to go home; they sleep at work. On the morning of February 14, 2014, the visitor parking deck was completely closed from 5:00 a.m. until approximately 7:00 a.m. due to snow and ice conditions. That morning, prior to Hall's fall, a security officer patrolled the visitor deck at 2:45 a.m., 5:05 a.m., and 7:13 a.m.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   During the week of February 10, 2014, employees in St. Joseph's engineering department patrolled St. Joseph's entire campus every other hour, around the clock. On February 14, several employees in the engineering department worked together to clear the visitor's parking deck of snow and ice. Some employees drove a pickup truck with a spreader to spread sand and salt on the driving lanes of the deck, and other employees spread it by hand in areas that they could not get to with the truck and in parking spaces where cars had pulled out. The morning of February 14, the lead mechanic in the engineering department spread sand and salt with the truck spreader at 3:00 a.m., 5:00 a.m., and 6:00 a.m. At 7:00 a.m., he walked the deck on patrol, using a push spreader to treat the travelable areas, and did not encounter any slick patches or black ice in those areas. Four other engineers were with him at the time, some on foot and others in the truck. Prior to Hall's fall, St. Joseph's was not aware of any other falls on ice outside the hospital during the week of February 10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Hall and his wife sued St. Joseph's for negligence and loss of consortium. Following discovery, St. Joseph's moved for summary judgment, contending that it had not breached any duty owed to Hall to discover and remove naturally accumulating ice in winter weather, that it lacked knowledge of the ice upon which Hall fell, and that Hall had failed to exercise ordinary care for his own safety. The trial court denied St. Joseph's motion, ruling that jury questions remained as to\n   whether St. Joseph's had superior knowledge of the specific danger of black ice in the upper level of the parking deck and whether St. Joseph's actions in attempting to clear the ice made the icy conditions less obvious.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   1. St. Joseph's contends that the trial court erred in holding that questions of fact remained as to whether it had superior knowledge of the patch of black ice on which Hall fell and whether its remedial efforts to clear the parking deck of snow and ice contributed to the icy conditions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Where an owner or occupier of land, by express or implied invitation, induces or leads others to come upon his premises for any lawful purpose, he is liable in damages to such persons for injuries caused by his failure to exercise ordinary care in keeping the premises and approaches safe.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   OCGA \u00a7 51-3-1.

In\n   <em>\n    Petrosky\n   </em>\n   , this Court held that the condominium association had constructive knowledge of the hazardous icy conditions encountered by Petrosky in the parking lot because the association lacked any inspection procedure and did not inspect the premises on the date of Petrosky's fall.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5477006\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ga-app/284/354/#p356\">\n    Id. at 357\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1)(a),\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5477006\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ga-app/284/354/#p356\">\n    643 S.E.2d 855\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Here, however, the evidence shows that, during the week of the winter storm, St. Joseph's had round-the-clock patrols by the engineering department and security officers to look for snow and ice, and that those patrols continued on the day Hall fell. The engineering department also worked to clear the hospital premises, including the parking decks, of snow and ice. The lead engineer testified that he and four other engineers spread salt and sand in the travelable areas of the parking deck, by truck and by hand, at 7:00 on the morning of February 14 and that he did not encounter any slick patches or black ice in those areas. A security officer also patrolled the deck from approximately 7:13 to 7:25 that morning. St. Joseph's has shown that it had a reasonable inspection procedure in place for the visitor parking deck under the prevailing weather conditions and that the procedure was actually carried out on the day Hall fell. Thus, constructive knowledge of the hazard cannot be inferred based on the lack of a reasonable inspection procedure. See generally\n   <em>\n    Watts &amp; Colwell Builders, Inc. v.

As St. Joseph's points out, in slip and fall cases involving ice in winter weather, we have held that where the accumulation of ice \"on a premises is naturally occurring and not attributable to any affirmative action on the proprietor's part, the proprietor has no affirmative duty to discover and remove it in the absence of evidence that it had become an obvious hazard by means other than natural accumulation.\" (Citation and punctuation omitted.)\n   <em>\n    Kouche v.

The trial court determined that this rule did not apply because St. Joseph's remedial efforts caused ice on the parking deck to unfreeze and refreeze each evening and thus the ice was not simply a result of natural accumulation. But St. Joseph's remedial efforts did not create ice that had not accumulated naturally; the accumulation was ice before it was treated and if the surface did not completely dry before temperatures dropped again, it naturally became ice again. This is not a situation where St. Joseph's created ice that was not already there. Cf.\n   <em>\n    Martin v.

Without evidence that Hall was aware of St. Joseph's voluntarily imposed policies and procedures prior to his fall, he could not have relied upon them, and St. Joseph's cannot be held liable based on a theory of voluntary undertaking.

St. Joseph's contends that the trial court erred by holding that Hall exercised ordinary care for his own safety as a matter of law.
