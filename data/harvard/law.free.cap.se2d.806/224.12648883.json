Suggs moved to suppress all evidence surrounding and including his arrest, contending that the deputy lacked the authority to investigate and/or arrest him outside of Hall County. The trial court agreed with Suggs that the deputy exceeded his authority outside of Hall County, but held that suppression of the evidence was not warranted because the arrest did not amount to a violation of Suggs's constitutional rights. We granted Suggs's motion for interlocutory appeal in order to review the trial court's order. For the following reasons, we conclude that the trial court erred to the extent that it held that the deputy was not authorized to investigate and/or arrest Suggs outside of Hall County; we nevertheless affirm the trial court's order denying Suggs's motion to suppress as right for any reason.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   The pertinent facts underlying Suggs's motion are undisputed, and we therefore apply a\n   de novo review to the trial court's application of the law to the facts.

State\n   </em>\n   , --- Ga. ----, ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12461353\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ga/301/563/#p220\">\n    802 S.E.2d 217\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 220 (2017) (\"When the evidence at a suppression hearing is uncontroverted and the credibility of witnesses is not in question, we conduct a de novo review of the trial court's application of the law to the undisputed facts.\") (citation and punctuation omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The record shows that in September 2015, a Hall County deputy sheriff was on traffic enforcement duty at an intersection located in Hall County when he observed Suggs fail to bring his vehicle to a complete stop before entering the highway. The deputy followed Suggs for approximately two miles, during which he observed Suggs repeatedly cross the center lane of the highway and make a wide left turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The deputy conducted a traffic stop of Suggs's vehicle and could smell alcohol emanating from Suggs's person as he struggled getting his driver's license out of his wallet. Suspecting that Suggs was under the influence of alcohol but believing that it was unsafe to conduct an investigation on the \"extremely rough\" dirt shoulder in close proximity to passing vehicles, the deputy instructed Suggs to pull his vehicle into a parking lot on the opposite side of the roadway. After performing roadside sobriety tests, the deputy arrested Suggs for DUI-less safe.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Although the initial stop of Suggs's vehicle was conducted in Hall County, Suggs and the deputy crossed the county line when they entered the parking lot, resulting in the investigation and subsequent arrest taking place in Barrow County.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Suggs filed a motion to suppress, arguing that the deputy had no authority to gather evidence against or arrest him outside of Hall County.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Relying on the recent case of\n   <em>\n    Zilke v.

The\n   <em>\n    Zilke\n   </em>\n   Court reversed our opinion after concluding that the plain language of OCGA \u00a7 17-4-23 (a) could not be reasonably construed to enlarge the territorial boundaries of a campus police officer.

In so doing, the Court disapproved of any prior cases in which we relied on OCGA \u00a7 17-4-23 (a) to \"authorize[ ] a law enforcement officer, including a campus police officer, to make a\n   custodial arrest outside the jurisdiction of the law enforcement agency by which he is employed.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12441359\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ga/299/232/\">\n    Id. at 234-235\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12441359\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ga/299/232/\">\n    787 S.E.2d 745\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ; see\n   <em>\n    Glazner v.

The trial court erred to the extent that it held otherwise.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Historically speaking, this Court held that the power of an officer to effect a warrantless arrest outside of the territorial boundary of his or her law enforcement agency for traffic-related offenses was derived from one of two statutes, OCGA \u00a7\u00a7 17-4-23 (a) and/or 40-13-30. See\n   <em>\n    State v. Heredia\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1042574\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ga-app/252/89/#p90\">\n    252 Ga.

But while the\n   <em>\n    Zilke\n   </em>\n   Court disapproved of the line of cases relying on OCGA \u00a7 17-4-23 (a), it did not consider or render any opinion as to the arrest authority conferred by OCGA \u00a7 40-13-30. That statute, specifically contained within Title 40 and governing traffic offenses, provides as follows:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   OCGA \u00a7 40-13-30. Authority to make arrests.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   Officers of the Georgia State Patrol and any other officer of this state or of any county or municipality thereof having authority to arrest for a criminal offense of the grade of misdemeanor shall have authority to prefer charges and bring offenders to trial under this article, provided that officers of an incorporated municipality shall have no power to make arrests beyond the corporate limits of such municipality unless such jurisdiction is given by local or other law.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Recognizing that the statute's territorial restriction is limited to arrests made by municipal officers, we have held that \"by implication [,] ... certain officers (including deputy sheriffs) have arrest powers\n   for these offenses outside their appointed territories.\" (Citation and punctuation omitted.)\n   <em>\n    Hastings v.
