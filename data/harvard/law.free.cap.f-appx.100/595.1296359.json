Hinton, U.S. Penitenitary, At-water, CA, pro se.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b625-20\">Before MORRIS SHEPPARD ARNOLD, FAGG, and SMITH, Circuit Judges.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b625-21\">[UNPUBLISHED]</p>\n<author id=\"b625-22\">PER CURIAM.</author>\n<p id=\"b625-23\">Dion M. Hinton pleaded guilty to possession with intent to distribute 50 grams or more of a mixture or substance containing cocaine base (crack), in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1) and (b)(1). The district court<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> sentenced him to 262 months imprisonment and 5 years supervised release. On appeal, his counsel has moved to withdraw and filed a brief under <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), and Mr. Hinton has filed a pro se supplemental brief. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-24\">After careful review, we find the ineffective-assistance claims raised by counsel and Mr. Hinton are not properly before us. <em>See United States v. Jackson, </em>204 F.3d 812, 815 (8th Cir.2000). The other arguments Mr. Hinton raises are also unavailing. The convictions Mr. Hinton challenges qualify him for career-offender status regardless whether the sentences were suspended or served (and nothing in the record supports Mr. Hinton\u2019s contention that either sentence was suspended), as the convictions are crimes of violence \u201cpunishable\u201d by imprisonment for a term exceeding 1 year. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>comment, (n.l) (\u201cprior felony conviction\u201d means federal or state conviction for offense punishable by death or imprisonment for term exceeding 1 year, regardless whether such offense is specifically designated as felony and regardless of actual sentence imposed); <em>United States v. Gonzales, </em>220 F.3d 922, 926 (8th Cir.2000) (unsentenced guilty plea is prior conviction for purposes of \u00a7 4B1.1). Whether the unlawful-sexual-intercourse offense could in the future be reduced to a misdemeanor is also irrelevant for career-offender purposes. Cf<em>. Ewing v. California, </em>538 U.S. 11, 28-29, 123 S.Ct. 1179, 155 L.Ed.2d 108 (2003) (though California courts have discretion to reduce \u201cwobbler\u201d offense to misdemeanor, \u201cit remains a felony for all purposes \u2018unless and until the trial court imposes a misdemeanor sentence.\u2019 \u201d (citations omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b626-4\">Having found no nonfrivolous issues after reviewing under <em>Penson v. Ohio, </em>488 U.S. 75, 80, 109 S.Ct. 346, 102 L.Ed.2d 300 (1988), we affirm. We also grant counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b625-16\">.
