He is presently incarcerated, serving a term of seventy-eight months\u2019 imprisonment. We assume familiarity with the record and the proceedings before the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-6\">1. <em>Evidence of Fantauzzi\u2019s Past Cooperation</em></p>\n<p id=\"b71-7\">Washington submits that the district court erred in allowing the prosecution to elicit testimony from Victor Fantauzzi and a law enforcement officer about Fantauzzi\u2019s work as a confidential informant in other investigations.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-8\">a. <em>Relevancy Challenge</em></p>\n<p id=\"b71-9\">Washington asserts that the evidence was irrelevant and, therefore, inadmissible under Fed.R.Evid. 402. We have long accorded district courts \u201cbroad discretion regarding the admission of evidence,\u201d <em>United States v. SEW Metals Alloys, Inc., </em>195 F.3d 83, 87 (2d Cir.1999), mindful that a trial judge is in a better position than a reviewing court to assess the probative value of proffered evidence relative to possible unfair prejudice, <em>see United States v. Valdez, </em>16 F.3d 1324, 1332 (2d Cir.1994). We will reverse only if the district court\u2019s evidentiary ruling was \u201carbitrary and irrational.\u201d <em>United States v. Dhinsa, </em>243 F.3d 635, 649 (2d Cir.2001); <em>see United States v. Salameh, </em>152 F.3d 88, 110 (2d Cir.1998) (per curiam). That is not this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-10\">The defense, in its opening statement, had attacked Fantauzzi\u2019s credibility, promising to elicit testimony from him that would show the jury \u201cwhat kind of a person he is, what his character is.\u201d Trial Tr. 22. Among the facts likely to be adduced to support this attack was Fantauzzi\u2019s receipt of both sentencing consideration and cash for his cooperation with the government. <em>United States v. Cosentino, </em>844 F.2d 30, 32-33 (2d Cir.1988), instructs that the government may meet such an attack not only by eliciting the damaging information itself, but by placing it in a context that may support its own credibility argument. Fantauzzi\u2019s benefits had not, after all, derived exclusively from his cooperation against Washington; he had cooperated with various federal and state law enforcement officials in hundreds of drug purchases involving more than a score of targets. We conclude that the district court acted well within its discretion in admitting evidence of this broader cooperation.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-12\">b. <em>Constitutional Challenge</em></p>\n<p id=\"b71-13\">Washington further argues that receipt of the challenged testimony violated his Sixth Amendment right to confrontation and his Fifth Amendment right to due process. As to the former, in <em>Delaware v. Fensterer, </em>474 U.S. 15, 18, 106 S.Ct. 292, 88 L.Ed.2d 15 (1985), the Supreme Court made clear that a Confrontation Clause violation can occur in only two situations: (1) when the district court erroneously admits out-of-court statements, or (2) when restrictions imposed by law or by the trial court impermissibly limit the scope of cross-examination. Neither circumstance is here at issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-14\">As to the Fifth Amendment, Washington argues that the challenged testimony somehow lowered the government\u2019s burden of proof, violating his right to due process. We disagree. The district court repeatedly instructed the jury that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>government had the burden to prove Washington\u2019s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-4\">Accordingly, Washington\u2019s constitutional challenges are without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-5\">2. <em>Obstruction of Justice</em></p>\n<p id=\"b72-6\">Washington submits that the district court erred in imposing a two-level increase in his guideline offense level based on his perjurious trial testimony. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.1. On this point, we review the district court\u2019s findings of fact for clear error and its legal determinations <em>de novo, </em>giving \u201cdue deference to the district court\u2019s application of the guidelines to the facts.\u201d <em>United States v. Cassiliano, </em>137 F.3d 742, 745 (2d Cir.1998); <em>see United States v. Ben-Shimon, </em>249 F.3d 98, 102 (2d Cir.2001) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b72-7\">\u201c[T]o base a \u00a7 3C1.1 enhancement upon the giving of perjured testimony, a sentencing court must find that the defendant 1) willfully 2) and materially 3) committed perjury, which is (a) the intentional (b) giving of false testimony (c) as to a material matter.\u201d <em>United States v. Zagari, </em>111 F.3d 307, 329 (2d Cir.1997); <em>accord United States v. Ben-Shimon, </em>249 F.3d at 102. Here, the district court specifically found that each of these elements had been satisfied based upon the evidence adduced at trial, the contents of Washington\u2019s testimony, the jury verdict, and its own observation of Washington\u2019s demeanor during his testimony. Washington challenges several of the district court\u2019s factual conclusions, specifically those that he possessed the requisite mens rea, but we see no basis for concluding that these findings were clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-8\">Washington also submits that the enhancement was improper because penalizing him for denying the charges \u201craises troubling constitutional issues on his right to testify and to present evidence.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Br. at 25. We disagree. As the district court noted, the Constitution does not provide the right to commit perjury. <em>See United States v. Dunnigan, </em>507 U.S. 87, 96, 113 S.Ct. 1111, 122 L.Ed.2d 445 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b72-10\">Because we conclude that Washington\u2019s arguments are uniformly unavailing, we AFFIRM the judgment of conviction.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
