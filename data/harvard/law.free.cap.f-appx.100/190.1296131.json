Reid was sentenced to 572 months of imprisonment, to be followed by a five-year term of supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-5\">Reid\u2019s counsel filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), stating that there were no meritorious grounds for appeal but raising five potential issues: (1) whether the district court abused its discretion in refusing to strike a juror for cause; (2) whether the court abused its discretion in denying Reid\u2019s motion to sever; (3) whether the court abused its discretion in denying expert testimony; (4) whether the evidence was sufficient on counts three, four, seven and eight of the indictment; and (5) whether the court erred in enhancing Reid\u2019s offense level for abduction under <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 2B3.1(b)(4)(A) (2002). Reid was advised of her right to file a pro se supplemental brief, but declined to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-6\">We have reviewed the record and conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to strike the juror for cause, in denying Reid\u2019s motion to sever or in excluding Reid\u2019s expert\u2019s testimony. Further, in viewing the verdict in the light most favorable to the Government, we find substantial evidence to support the jury\u2019s finding of guilt on all counts. <em>See Glasser v. United States, </em>315 U.S. 60, 80, 62 S.Ct. 457, 86 L.Ed. 680 (1942); <em>United States v. Newsome, </em>322 F.3d 328, 333 (4th Cir.2003). Finally, we cannot say that the district court clearly erred in its application of the abduction enhancement to Reid\u2019s offense level. <em>United States v. Nale, </em>101 F.3d 1000, 1003 (4th Cir.1996) (stating standard of review). Therefore, counsel\u2019s proposed arguments are without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-8\">In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the entire record in this case and have found no meritorious issues for appeal. Accordingly, we affirm Reid\u2019s conviction and sentence. This court requires that counsel inform his client, in writing, of her right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-9\">We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-10\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
