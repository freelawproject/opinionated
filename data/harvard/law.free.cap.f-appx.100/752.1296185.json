On appeal, Mr. Mack urges three grounds for us to find error below: (1) a variance between his indictment and the verdict forms, (2) improper jury instructions, and (3) an improper limi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"754\">*754</page-number>tation upon his cross-examination of a government witness. We take jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-4\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b784-5\">This appeal represents the culmination of the government\u2019s investigation and prosecution of an extensive drug conspiracy. The government presented evidence at trial showing that the central player in the conspiracy was Darrell Bellamy of Phoenix, Arizona. From Phoenix, Mr. Bellamy coordinated shipments of powder cocaine, crack cocaine, and marijuana to various cities, including Tulsa, Oklahoma; Wichita, Kansas; and Detroit, Michigan. The government contends that Mr. Mack was a member of this conspiracy.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-6\">A federal grand jury indicted Mr. Mack and fifteen alleged coconspirators. The indictment charged Mr. Mack with the following: (1) conspiring to possess and distribute cocaine, crack cocaine, and marijuana in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 846; (2) possessing crack cocaine with intent to distribute in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1) and (b)(l)(A)(iii); (3) conspiring to commit money laundering in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1956(h); (4) possessing marijuana with intent to distribute in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1) and (b)(1)(c); and (5) criminal forfeiture pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 982 and 1956(h).</p>\n<p id=\"b784-7\">After a twenty-three-day trial involving over fifty witnesses, a jury convicted Mr. Mack on all counts. At trial, multiple witnesses testified to Mr. Mack\u2019s involvement in the conspiracy. Specifically, the government introduced the following evidence of Mr. Mack\u2019s involvement in the conspiracy: (1) the police arrested him in 1998 at a Tulsa airport in connection with a marijuana shipment; (2) he phoned and transferred money to Mr. Bellamy frequently during the duration of the conspiracy; (3) Mr. Mack assisted in and supervised the packaging and shipping of marijuana for the conspiracy on multiple occasions; (4) officers arrested Mr. Mack for possessing cocaine with intent to distribute outside of a Tulsa airport as he returned from Phoenix; and (5) several witnesses testified that Mr. Mack murdered two men that he claimed stole cocaine from him.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-9\">The District Court sentenced Mr. Mack to life in prison to be followed by five years\u2019 supervised release and imposed $15,517 in assessments and restitution. Mr. Mack filed timely notice of appeal, raising three issues. We address each in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-10\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b784-11\">A. <em>Variance</em></p>\n<p id=\"b784-12\">1. <em>Standard of Review</em></p>\n<p id=\"b784-13\">Mr. Mack first argues that a fatal variance existed between the grand jury indictment and the evidence presented at trial because the indictment alleged a single conspiracy whereas the evidence proved only multiple drug conspiracies. Because Mr. Mack failed to raise the issue of variance before the District Court, we review it for plain error. <em>United States v. Bailey, </em>327 F.3d 1131, 1142 (10th Cir. 2003). To meet this standard, Mr. Mack must show that (1) there was error; (2) the error was \u201cplain\u201d or \u201cobvious\u201d; (3) the error affected his substantial rights; and (4) the error seriously affected the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings. <em>United States v. Edgar, </em>348 F.3d 867, 871 (10th Cir.2003). If all four prongs are satisfied, we \u201cmay then exercise [our] discretion to notice [the] forfeited error.\u201d <em>United States v. Gonzalez Edeza, </em>359 F.3d 1246, 1250 (10th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b785-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"755\">*755</page-number>2. <em>Merits</em></p>\n<p id=\"b785-5\">Here, we need only consider the \u201cdispositive fourth prong \u2014 whether the alleged [variance] affected the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1251. In cases of variance, a defendant cannot satisfy the fourth prong of plain error review if there is \u201coverwhelming and essentially uncontroverted\u201d evidence of his guilt as to the charged crime or a closely related crime on which evidence was submitted. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b785-6\">Mr. Mack\u2019s claim fails under this standard. He admits in his brief that: (1) the government proved the existence of multiple drug conspiracies; (2) \u201cthe government\u2019s case was admittedly strong concerning the substantive counts against [him]\u201d; (3) \u201cthere was ample evidence of [his] involvement with the <em>Tulsa </em>organization ... in distributing <em>marijuana </em>\u201d; (4) he was arrested for transporting cocaine from Phoenix to Tulsa on August 22, 2000; and (5) he maintained extensive contact with Mr. Bellamy through phone conversations and money transfers. The record evidence supports these concessions. As such, we find that overwhelming and essentially uncontroverted evidence exists of Mr. Mack\u2019s participation in a drug conspiracy and that the \u201creal threat ... to the fairness, integrity, or reputation of judicial proceedings would\u201d come from vacating Mr. Mack\u2019s conviction.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>United States v. Cotton, </em>535 U.S. 625, 634, 122 S.Ct. 1781, 152 L.Ed.2d 860 (2002) (internal quotations omitted). Thus, we decline to recognize plain error under Mr. Mack\u2019s variance claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-9\">B. <em>Jury Instructions</em></p>\n<p id=\"b785-10\">1. <em>Standard of Review</em></p>\n<p id=\"b785-11\">Mr. Mack next argues that the District Court committed plain error because the conspiracy instructions given \u201cdid not adequately address the problem of single/multiple conspiracies.\u201d As we explained in a companion case, because Mr. Mack\u2019s counsel did not object individually to this issue at trial, we review this issue for plain error. <em>See United States v. Ray, </em>370 F.3d 1039 (10th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b785-12\">2. <em>Merits</em></p>\n<p id=\"b785-13\">As with his variance claim, we need only consider the \u201cdispositive fourth prong\u2014 whether the alleged [instructional] error affected the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Mr. Mack did not argue that the alleged instructional error affected the fairness, integrity, or reputation of judicial proceedings, as is his burden. See <em>United States v. Vonn, </em>535 U.S. 55, 63, 122 S.Ct. 1043, 152 L.Ed.2d 90 (2002) (\u201c[B]ecause relief on plain-error review is in the discretion of the reviewing court, a defendant has the further burden to persuade the court that the error seriously affect[ed] the fairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d) (internal quotations omitted). Moreover, our independent review convinces us that he cannot meet that standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"756\">*756</page-number>A defendant cannot satisfy the fourth prong of plain error review if there exists \u201coverwhelming and essentially uncontroverted\u201d evidence of his guilt as to the charged crime or a closely related crime on which evidence was submitted. <em>Gonzalez Edeza, </em>359 F.3d at 1251. For the same reasons we rejected Mr. Mack\u2019s variance claim, we also find that he cannot satisfy the fourth prong of plain error review here. As such, we affirm the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-4\">C. <em>Cross-Examination</em></p>\n<p id=\"b786-5\">1. <em>Standard of Review</em></p>\n<p id=\"b786-6\">Finally, Mr. Mack argues that the District Court erred in refusing to allow his counsel to impeach Robert Robertson with his allegedly inconsistent grand jury testimony, styling this as a violation of both Fed.R.Evid. 613(b) and his Sixth Amendment right \u201cto be confronted with the witnesses against him.\u201d U.S. Const, amend. VI. For Mr. Mack\u2019s evidentiary challenge, we review for an abuse of discretion whether an error occurred and, if so, whether the error was harmless. <em>United States v. Begay, </em>144 F.3d 1336, 1339 (10th Cir.1998). The government bears the burden to show that a nonconstitutional error is harmless by a preponderance of the evidence. <em>United States v. Wittgenstein, </em>163 F.3d 1164, 1169 (10th Cir.1998). An error \u201cis harmless unless it had a \u2018substantial influence\u2019 on the outcome or leaves one in \u2018grave doubt\u2019 as to whether it had such effect.\u201d <em>United States v. Cestnik, </em>36 F.3d 904, 910 (10th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b786-7\">As to the Sixth Amendment inquiry, we review de novo whether an error occurred and, if so, we review whether the error was harmless. <em>United States v. Joe, </em>8 F.3d 1488, 1497 (10th Cir.1993). The government bears the burden to show that a constitutional error is harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Chapman v. California, </em>386 U.S. 18, 24, 87 S.Ct. 824, 17 L.Ed.2d 705 (1967)). For Confrontation Clause violations, whether \u201can error is harmless depends on (1) the importance of the witness\u2019s testimony in the prosecution\u2019s case; (2) whether the testimony was cumulative; (3) the presence or absence of evidence corroborating or contradicting the testimony of the witness on material points; (4) the extent of the actual cross-examination; and (5) the overall strength of the State\u2019s case.\u201d <em>Jones v. Gibson, </em>206 F.3d 946, 957 (10th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b786-9\">2. <em>Merits</em></p>\n<p id=\"b786-10\">Mr. Mack contends that he suffered prejudice from this alleged error because Mr. Robertson\u2019s testimony was the <em>\u201csole </em>basis for viewing the murders allegedly committed by Mr. Mack as part of a single conspiracy\u201d and that, absent Mr. Robertson\u2019s testimony, there was a \u201cdearth of other evidence that the murders and the cocaine underlying those crimes were part of the <em>same conspiracy </em>charged in the indictment.\u201d Because, even reviewing under the more rigorous Confrontation Clause standard, the government meets its burden to prove harmlessness beyond a reasonable doubt, we need not definitively decide whether the District Court committed error in refusing to allow the impeachment. <em>See United States v. Magleby, </em>241 F.3d 1306, 1318 (10th Cir.2001) (\u201cNotwithstanding our doubts regarding the relevance of this testimony, we need not decide whether the district court abused its discretion in admitting it because we find that it was harmless error.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b786-11\">First, although Mr. Robertson\u2019s testimony was undoubtedly helpful to the government, the record does not indicate that it was uniquely or especially important. Indeed, several witnesses testified to seeing Mr. Mack package marijuana at various locations, including Mr. Bellamy\u2019s home. Several witnesses also testified that they <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"757\">*757</page-number>purchased marijuana from Mr. Mack, with at least one witness stating that Mr. Mack told him that Mr. Mack received his marijuana from Phoenix. Furthermore, the government offered extensive phone records to indicate that Mr. Mack frequently called Mr. Bellamy and wired substantial amounts of money to Mr. Bellamy and other coconspirators during the alleged conspiracy. Moreover, Jennifer Natale, one of the conspiracy\u2019s chief couriers, testified that Mr. Mack drove her car back to Phoenix after she had dropped drugs in Tulsa and that he followed her during a drug transport from Phoenix to Tulsa. Because, in light of this evidence, we cannot say that Mr. Robertson\u2019s testimony was uniquely important to the government, this factor weighs in the government\u2019s favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-5\">Second, as shown above, much of Mr. Robertson\u2019s testimony duplicated other evidence of Mr. Mack\u2019s general drug activities. Again, this factor weighs in the government\u2019s favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-6\">Third, some witnesses disputed at least portions of Mr. Robertson\u2019s testimony, specifically those relating to Mr. Mack\u2019s alleged cocaine purchase from Mr. Bellamy in 2000. Nonetheless, Mr. Mack\u2019s August 2000 arrest for possessing with intent to distribute almost 120 grams of crack cocaine undoubtedly corroborates Mr. Robertson\u2019s testimony. As such, we find that this factor does not weigh particularly strong in favor of either party.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-7\">Finally, Mr. Mack admits that \u201cthe court did allow cross-examination of Robertson,\u201d and that \u201cthe court showed considerable latitude with\u201d respect to the cross-examination of Mr. Robertson, even though \u201cthe cross examination techniques of several defense counsel tried the court\u2019s patience throughout the trial.\u201d Our independent review of the record confirms these concessions. Indeed, we note that the cross-examination of Mr. Robertson consumes nearly ninety pages of the record on appeal, with approximately fifteen of those attributable solely to Mr. Mack\u2019s trial counsel. We, therefore, find that this factor weighs decidedly in the government\u2019s favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-11\">After balancing these factors, we conclude that the government has proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the alleged limitation on Mr. Robertson\u2019s testimony did not affect the outcome of the trial. As such, we affirm the ruling of the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-12\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b787-13\">For the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM the judgment of the District Court on all claims.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b783-14\"><em> </em>This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. This court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b785-7\">. Mr. Mack argued in his brief and at oral argument that no evidence established a \"rim\u201d between the various \"spokes\u201d of the alleged conspiracy. We note, however, that there is undisputed evidence that in July 1998 Richard Taylor, a codefendant and alleged member of the Tulsa \"spoke\u201d of the conspiracy, wired money to Kenneth Stiger and Mr. Mack, who were having car trouble in Dalhart, Texas. Although record evidence confirms Mr. Mack\u2019s characterization of Mr. Stiger as a member of the Phoenix \"hub,\u201d we note that substantial evidence indicates that Mr. Stiger leased an apartment in Wichita, which he shared with his girlfriend. Therefore, contrary to Mr. Mack\u2019s'suggestions, the record does evidence at least some connection between the Tulsa and Wichita \"spokes\u201d of the conspiracy. Because we decide this issue on different grounds, however, we need not definitively decide the structure of the conspiracy in this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b787-8\">. Because we affirm the District Court on all claims, we need not address Mr. Mack\u2019s re-sentencing arguments.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
