On appeal, Bowles\u2019 sole issue is that he was entitled to a jury trial on his retaliation claim under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12203 (2000). We find this claim to be without merit. <em>See Kramer v. Banc of Am. Sec., </em>355 F.3d 961, 964-66 (7th Cir.) (holding that because an ADA retaliation claimant is limited to equitable relief, he is not entitled to a jury trial), <em>petition for cert. filed, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 124 S.Ct. 2876, \u2014 L.Ed.2d-, 72 U.S.L.W. 3674 (Apr. 16, 2004) (No. 03-14). Accordingly, we affirm. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b920-7\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
