The district court denied his petition. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-14\">Before oral argument, we asked the parties to brief whether the Supreme Court\u2019s recent decision in <em>Crawford v. Washington, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 124 S.Ct. 1354, 158 L.Ed.2d 177 (2004), abrogating <em>Ohio v. Roberts, </em>448 U.S. 56, 100 S.Ct. 2531, 65 L.Ed.2d 597 (1980), applies to Lies\u2019s case. After considering the parties\u2019 letter briefs, and in light of the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act\u2019s mandate that this court review Lies\u2019s claims under the clearly established Supreme Court precedent as of the time of the relevant state-court decision, we conclude <em>Crawford </em>does not apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-17\">Oral argument, the parties\u2019 briefs, and our study of both the appellate record and the applicable law convince this court that the district court correctly decided to deny Lies\u2019s petition. Thus, we affirm the district court\u2019s judgment for the reasons stated in that court\u2019s Opinion and Order denying the petition. We do not consider Lies\u2019s cumulative error claim because he failed to raise it in state court or the district court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
