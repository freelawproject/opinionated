A jury found that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"834\">*834</page-number>UDC had not only discriminated against Ohal by refusing to promote him to a relatively senior administrative position, but also retaliated against him for his earlier discrimination complaints. The district court awarded Ohal front and back-pay and directed UDC to place him in a position \u201cequivalent\u201d to one for which he had applied.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-4\">Ohal subsequently filed this action, seeking to hold UDC in contempt for failing to comply with the court\u2019s order to give him an equivalent job and contending that university officials had unlawfully retaliated against him for his first victory by gradually eroding the power and perquisites of the job it did give him. The gist of the retaliation claim is that after Ohal was reinstated, university officials \u2014 and in particular his supervisor, LaVerne BlagmonEarl \u2014 took steps to reduce his supervisory authority. The complaint alleges that: a secretary who worked for Ohal\u2019s predecessor and was transferred to BlagmonEarl\u2019s office prior to Ohal\u2019s reinstatement was not replaced; a career counselor who retired in 2000 was not replaced; Blagmon-Earl not only unilaterally decided to fire a contract employee who served Ohal and his predecessors for five years, but also transferred the program that the employee oversaw to her office; BlagmonEarl assigned tasks to Ohal\u2019s subordinates without informing or consulting him, and sometimes signed their leave slips even when Ohal was present to do so; and other employees were transferred from Ohal\u2019s office to Blagmon-Earl\u2019s.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-5\">The district court dismissed Ohal\u2019s retaliation claim pursuant to rule 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, concluding that Ohal\u2019s allegations revealed that he had not suffered the requisite \u201cadverse employment action.\u201d The court subsequently refused to hold UDC in contempt, finding that the job the university had given Ohal was \u201ccomparable\u201d to the one for which he had applied.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-7\">As to the retaliation claim, we think it clear that UDC\u2019s reduction of Ohal\u2019s supervisory responsibilities after reinstating him, if true (and for purposes of the motion to dismiss we assume the truth of the allegations, <em>see, e.g., Warren v. District of Columbia, </em>353 F.3d 36, 39 (D.C.Cir.2004)), constitutes an adverse employment action. In <em>Burke v. Gould, </em>286 F.3d 513 (D.C.Cir.2002), we stated that \u201cwe have no doubt that the removal of Burke\u2019s supervisory responsibilities constituted an adverse employment action.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 522. And in <em>Stewart v. Ashcroft, </em>352 F.3d 422 (D.C.Cir.2003), we made clear that a material reduction of supervisory responsibilities, no less than a total deprivation of such responsibilities, can amount to an adverse employment action. <em>See id. </em>at 427 (\u201cJust as withdrawing an employee\u2019s supervisory duties constitutes an adverse employment action, so too failing to select an employee for a position with substantially greater supervisory authority is an adverse employment action.\u201d (citation omitted)); <em>see also Crady v. Liberty Nat\u2019l Bank &amp; Trust Co. of Ind., </em>993 F.2d 132, 136 (7th Cir.1993), <em>quoted in Burlington Indus., Inc. v. Ellerth, </em>524 U.S. 742, 761, 118 S.Ct. 2257, 141 L.Ed.2d 633 (1998) (\u201cA materially adverse change might be indicated by a termination of employment, a demotion evidenced by a decrease in wage or salary, a less distinguished title, a material loss of benefits, <em>significantly diminished material responsibilities, </em>or other indices that might be unique to a particular situation.\u201d (emphasis added)).</p>\n<p id=\"b864-8\"><em>Brown v. Brody, </em>199 F.3d 446 (D.C.Cir.1999), is not to the contrary. There we stated only that lateral transfers, i.e., those involving no change in salary or benefits, do not constitute adverse employment actions \u201cunless there are some other materi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"835\">*835</page-number>ally adverse consequences affecting the terms, conditions, or privileges of her employment or her future employment opportunities such that a reasonable trier of fact could conclude that the plaintiff has suffered objectively tangible harm.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 457. That we ultimately found no such \u201cother materially adverse consequences\u201d in <em>Brown </em>does not preclude them presence in this case. We of course express no opinion on whether there were such consequences here, or on whether \u2014 if there were \u2014 the university can show that it had a legitimate non-discriminatory explanation for its actions. We merely conclude that Ohal\u2019s allegations suffice to survive a motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b865-5\">Turning to the contempt issue, we begin by noting Ohal\u2019s heavy burden. Not only does a contempt finding require clear and convincing evidence of contempt, <em>see, e.g., Shepherd v. Am. Broad. Cos., </em>62 F.3d 1469, 1477 (D.C.Cir.1995), but we review the district court\u2019s contempt ruling only for abuse of discretion, <em>see, e.g., Food Lion, Inc. v. United Food and Commercial Workers Int'l Union, </em>103 F.3d 1007, 1016 (D.C.Cir.1997). Ohal must therefore show that the district court\u2019s conclusion that the available evidence of contempt fell short of the clear and convincing standard was an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b865-6\">Ohal has not carried this exacting burden. The district court found that the position into which UDC placed Ohal was \u201ccomparable\u201d to the one for which he had applied. Ohal complains that \u201ccomparable\u201d is not the same as \u201cequivalent\u201d \u2014 the word the district court used in its earlier order \u2014 but while it is true that the two words can have different meanings, they can also have the same meaning. <em>See, e.g., Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary </em>461 (1993) (listing \u201cequivalent\u201d as a synonym for \u201ccomparable\u201d). Ohal offers no reason why it was nonetheless an abuse of discretion for the district court to interpret the word \u201cequivalent\u201d in its own prior order as meaning \u201ccomparable.\u201d Indeed, Ohal\u2019s complaint itself repeatedly uses the word \u201ccomparable\u201d when discussing compliance with the court\u2019s order. <em>See </em>Compl. K14, <em>reprinted in </em>J.A. at 13 (\u201c[T]he position of Director of Student Affairs was a comparable position to the Director of CASS, into which Dr. Ohal could have been placed by UDC in compliance with the July 1999 court order.\u201d); <em>id. </em>(\u201c[W]hat had been a comparable position to CASS ... was materially divided into smaller elements.... Therefore, UDC changed its organizational structure from one that would have accommodated Dr. Ohal\u2019s reinstatement to a position (comparable to the CASS Directorship) that complied with the July 1999 court order to one ... significantly smaller____\u201d). Ohal argues that the position he was given and the one for which he applied were not even comparable, but we think the district court was within its discretion to find otherwise. We therefore decline to overturn the court\u2019s refusal to hold UDC in contempt.</p>\n<p id=\"b865-9\">Pursuant to D.C. Circuit Rule 36, this disposition will not be published.
