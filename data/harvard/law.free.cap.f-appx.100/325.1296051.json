We affirm the ruling of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-24\">After Wynn was convicted for committing a number of federal crimes and was sentenced to prison, he sought to urge on direct appeal that he had received ineffective assistance of counsel. We affirmed his conviction and sentence, and noted that his claim of ineffective assistance should be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>raised in a \u00a7 2255 motion. Thereafter, Wynn retained appellate counsel to prosecute his habeas corpus claim. Wynn eventually filed such a claim, but did so after the prescribed time for doing so had expired. The district court refused to allow Wynn to continue on the theory that misleading communications from his habeas counsel had caused the late filing. On appeal, we remanded to the district court to hold an evidentiary hearing on Wynn\u2019s claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-4\">On remand, the district court found that Wynn had failed to establish that he had been misled by habeas counsel through misrepresentations to Wynn and to Wynn\u2019s father. The court ruled in the alternative that even if Wynn had relied on misrepresentations by counsel, his reliance was unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-5\">We have carefully reviewed the record in this case and the appellate briefs of counsel, and have heard oral argument from able counsel as well. In the end, we are satisfied that Wynn has failed to demonstrate clear error in the district court\u2019s ruling that any reliance by Wynn on counsel\u2019s alleged misrepresentation is unreasonable. As the district court\u2019s findings are plausible and supported by the evidence, the court\u2019s conclusions based on such findings cannot be clear error. <em>See Anderson v. City of Bessemer City, N.C., </em>470 U.S. 564, 105 S.Ct. 1504, 84 L.Ed.2d 518 (1985). Consequently, the district court\u2019s ruling that equitable tolling is not available to justify Wynn\u2019s untimely filing of his \u00a7 2255 petition is, in all respects, AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b355-10\"> Pursuant to 5TH CIR. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5TH CIR. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
