We grant the petition for review in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-18\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b691-19\">We lack jurisdiction to review the BIA\u2019s determination that Samsonov did not file his asylum application within one year of his entry into the United States. <em>See </em>Immigration and Nationality Act (\u201cINA\u201d) \u00a7 208(a)(2)(B), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(2)(B). Section 1158(a)(3) provides that \u201c[n]o court shall have jurisdiction to review any determination of the Attorney General under [section 1158(a)(2)].\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(3). Here, it is clear that the BIA denied Samsonov\u2019s application for asylum as untimely under section 1158(a)(2)(B), and found that he did not qualify for an exception under section 1158(a)(2)(D).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We have no juris<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"662\">*662</page-number>diction to review the BIA\u2019s determination. <em>Hakeem v. INS, </em>273 F.3d 812, 815-16 (9th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b692-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b692-5\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b692-6\">Samsonov\u2019s petition for review is governed by the permanent provisions of the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 because immigration proceedings were initiated after April 1, 1997. <em>See Kalaw v. INS, </em>133 F.3d 1147, 1149-50 (9th Cir.1997). We have jurisdiction pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a). Because the BIA adopted most of the IJ\u2019s reasoning, overturned the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination, and offered a short analysis of its own, we review both the BIA\u2019s decision and those aspects of the IJ\u2019s opinion that the BIA incorporated as its own. <em>See Molina-Estrada v. INS, </em>293 F.3d 1089, 1093 (9th Cir.2002). We review the agency\u2019s decision to deny withholding of removal for substantial evidence. <em>See INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 481, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b692-7\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b692-8\">Under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(b)(3), the \u201cAttorney General may not remove an alien to a country if the Attorney General decides that the alien\u2019s life or freedom would be threatened in that country because of the alien\u2019s race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.\u201d To obtain withholding of removal, Samsonov bore the burden of demonstrating a clear probability that he would be persecuted on the basis of a protected ground if he is sent back to Russia. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.16(b)(2); <em>INS v. Stevic, </em>467 U.S. 407, 430, 104 S.Ct. 2489, 81 L.Ed.2d 321 (1984); <em>Li v. Ashcroft, </em>356 F.3d 1153, 1157 n. 1 (9th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b692-11\">The IJ determined that Samsonov did not establish a clear probability that his life or freedom would be threatened in Russia based on his religion, and we agree. The only evidence Samsonov provided about possible religious persecution was his testimony recounting being attacked by some young people when leaving a Jewish theater, and being introduced to his fellow prisoners as a \u201ckike\u201d who had \u201csold out Russia ... as a Jewish person.\u201d The IJ and BIA correctly determined that these acts of discrimination did not rise to the level of persecution. <em>Ghaly v. INS, </em>58 F.3d 1425, 1431 (9th Cir.1995) (holding that persecution is an \u201cextreme\u201d concept).</p>\n<p id=\"b692-12\">However, Samsonov has raised a presumption of future persecution based on his political opinion. The BIA determined that the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determinations were not supported in the record, so we must accept Samsonov\u2019s factual contentions as true. <em>Kataria v. INS, </em>232 F.3d 1107, 1114 (9th Cir.2000). Because the BIA deemed Samsonov credible, no corroborating evidence is required. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.16(b); <em>Ladha v. INS, </em>215 F.3d 889, 900-01 (9th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b692-13\">The BIA erred by upholding the IJ\u2019s determination that Samsonov had not established a presumption of future persecution. The BIA concluded that Samsonov\u2019s testimony, though credible, was too vague; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"663\">*663</page-number>however, whether testimony is vague or not relates to a petitioner\u2019s credibility, not whether the events the petitioner describes (when taken as true) are legally sufficient to justify withholding of removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-5\">An applicant can establish eligibility for withholding of removal by first proving that he suffered persecution in the past. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.16(b)(l)(i). Evidence of past persecution is found when an applicant shows (1) an incident or incidents that rise to the level of persecution; (2) that the persecution was on account of the applicant\u2019s political opinion; and (3) that the persecution was committed either by the government or by forces the government was unwilling or unable to control. <em>See Chand v. INS, </em>222 F.3d 1066, 1073 (9th Cir.2000). Samsonov\u2019s credible testimony compels the conclusion that he has satisfied all three prongs.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-6\">First, Samsonov established that he suffered acts rising to the level of persecution, which is defined as \u201cthe infliction of suffering or harm upon those who differ [in political opinion] in a way regarded as offensive.\u201d <em>Baballah v. Ashcroft, </em>367 F.3d 1067 (9th Cir.2004) (amended opinion) (citation omitted). We have held that \u201cpersistent death threats and assaults on one\u2019s life, family, and business rise to the level of persecution within the meaning of the Act.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 987-88 (citation omitted). Samsonov testified credibly that he received anonymous threatening phone calls telling him to stop investigating his father\u2019s death and to close his publishing house, and that his publishing house was vandalized. In addition, Samsonov was abducted, beaten, threatened, and choked with a makeshift noose. Samsonov clearly endured physical and economic assaults on his life and business. <em>See Navas v. INS, </em>217 F.3d 646, 656 n. 9 (9th Cir.2000) (noting that vandalism, threatening telephone calls, and physical harm may all constitute persecution).</p>\n<p id=\"b693-8\">Second, Samsonov\u2019s testimony provided circumstantial evidence that his persecutors were motivated by his political opinion. <em>See Baballah, </em>slip op. at 5740. The anonymous telephone threats referred specifically to his father\u2019s death and the family\u2019s publishing house. The attackers who abducted him were clearly motivated by his publication of his father\u2019s anti-government manuscript. Samsonov has established that the persecution he suffered was linked to his expression (via publication) of a particular political opinion about the Russian government.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-9\">The third prong of the test is met when widespread persecution of a particular group is documented in State Department Country Reports, and when local government officials do not respond when an asylum applicant seeks help. <em>See Andriasian v. INS, </em>180 F.3d 1033, 1042-43 (9th Cir.1999). Both elements are present here. Samsonov testified that he received no assistance from local investigative authorities when he sought help after his father\u2019s death, the vandalism of his publishing house, and his abduction. In addition, the 2000 Russian Country Report lists numerous accounts of the abuses faced by print, television, and radio journalists who publicly criticize the government.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-10\">Because Samsonov has established past persecution, this gives rise to a presumption that he has also \u201cshown a clear probability of future persecution so as to entitle him to withholding of deportation.\u201d <em>Navas, </em>217 F.3d at 657; 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.16(b)(1)(i). Under <em>INS v. Ventura, </em>537 U.S. 12, 123 S.Ct. 353, 154 L.Ed.2d 272 (2002), we remand so the BIA may consider whether the government has rebutted this presumption by a preponderance of the evidence. <em>Ventura, </em>537 U.S. at 17-18, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"664\">*664</page-number>128 S.Ct. 353; 8 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 208.16(b)(l)(i)(A) (discussing evidence of changed country conditions), 208.16(b)(l)(ii). On remand the government may present evidence of recent changes in Russia. <em>Ventura, </em>537 U.S. at 18, 123 S.Ct. 353; <em>see also 8 </em>C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 1003.2(a) (permitting the BIA to reopen the record).</p>\n<p id=\"b694-5\">PETITION DISMISSED IN PART; GRANTED IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b691-12\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b691-13\">. The BIA may consider an untimely asylum application if the alien meets the criteria for \"extraordinary circumstances\u201d that excuse the delay. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.4(a)(5). We have received letter briefs by both parties pursuant to Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 28(j), addressing Samsonov's contention at oral argument that the Department of Justice's intent behind 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.4 permits us to reach the merits of his asylum claim. <em>See </em>65 Fed.Reg. 76121, 76123-24 (December 6, 2000). This portion of the regulatory history <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"662\">*662</page-number>suggests that the list of \"extraordinary circumstances\u201d should be expanded to include the time during which an alien maintains a valid status (as Samsonov did while he maintained his K-l non-immigrant flane\u00e9 visa), and that a petitioner may file for asylum within a reasonable period after such status expires. However, as noted above, we have no jurisdiction to review the BIA's discretionary decision regarding whether or not Samsonov demonstrated extraordinary circumstances.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
