His appellate brief, however, focused not on the grant of summary judgment, but rather on the court\u2019s pretrial discovery rulings.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-24\">Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 3(c)(1)(B) requires that a notice of appeal \u201cdesignate the judgment, order, or part thereof being appealed.\u201d The notice of appeal designated only the grant of summary judgment as being appealed, but we are unable to discern any argument in Youakim\u2019s briefs that takes issue with the district court\u2019s judgment. Although we liberally construe filings by <em>pro se </em>litigants, we must still be able to ascertain the arguments a litigant raises. <em>Anderson v. Hardman, </em>241 F.3d 544, 545 (7th Cir.2001). Further, Youakim neglected to provide citations to the record or to relevant authority to support his general assertions of error. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 28(a)(9); <em>Anderson </em>241 F.3d at 545-46. For all these reasons we dismiss his appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-25\">DISMISSED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
