R.App. P. 34(a)(2); 10th Cir. R. 4.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-10\">Petitioner Brett Wright appeals the district court\u2019s decision denying him habeas corpus relief, <em>see </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241, from his convictions and sentence imposed in an Army general court-martial. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-11\">Federal civil courts have only limited authority to review court-martial proceedings. <em>See Burns v. Wilson, </em>346 U.S. 137, 139-42, 144, 73 S.Ct. 1045, 97 L.Ed. 1508 (1953) (plurality). If the military courts have fully and fairly reviewed Pvt. Wright\u2019s claims, we cannot review them. <em>See Roberts v. Callahan, </em>321 F.3d 994, 995 (10th Cir.), <em>cert. denied,</em>\u2014 U.S.-, 124 S.Ct. 447, 157 L.Ed.2d 323 (2003). In determining whether we can review a claim, we consider four factors;</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b740-19\">1. The asserted error must be of substantial constitutional dimension.... 2. The issue must be one of law rather than of disputed fact already determined by the military tribunals.... 3. Military considerations may warrant different treatment of constitutional claims.... 4. The military courts must give adequate consideration to the issues involved and apply proper legal standards.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b740-20\"><em>Id. </em>at 996 (quotation omitted). These factors \u201cmerely aid[] our determination of whether the federal court may reach the merits of the case,\u201d and do not \u201cconstitute a separate hurdle\u201d to federal-court review. <em>Id. </em>at 997.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-21\">After considering these four factors and independently reviewing the record, <em>see id., </em>we conclude the military courts fully and fairly considered Pvt. Wright\u2019s claims four through seven,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> in which he alleges the court-martial proceedings denied him due process, the trial record was incomplete,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the convening authority exercised improper command control, and the judge abused his discretion in denying Pvt. Wright\u2019s challenge to a court-martial member for cause. We thus may not review these claims. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b741-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"711\">*711</page-number>This court can, however, consider habeas claims challenging the court-martial\u2019s jurisdiction. <em>See, e.g., McClaughry v. Deming, </em>186 U.S. 49, 68-69, 22 S.Ct. 786, 46 L.Ed. 1049 (1902); <em>Monk v. Zelez, </em>901 F.2d 885, 888 (10th Cir.1990) (per curiam). Pvt. Wright characterizes his first three claims as jurisdictional arguments. We nevertheless conclude these claims do not warrant habeas relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-5\">\u201cA court-martial organized under the laws of the United States is a court of special and limited jurisdiction.\u201d <em>Runkle v. United States, </em>122 U.S. 543, 555, 22 Ct.Cl. 487, 7 S.Ct. 1141, 30 L.Ed. 1167 (1887). \u201c[Wjholly unlike the case of a permanent court created by constitution or by statute,\u201d however, a court-martial \u201cis a special body convened for a specific purpose, and when that purpose is accomplished its duties are concluded and the court is dissolved.\u201d <em>Deming, </em>186 U.S. at 64. Further, it is a \u201ccreature of statute, and, as a body or tribunal, it must be convened and constituted in entire conformity with the provisions of the statute, or else it is without jurisdiction.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 62.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-6\">In challenging his court-martial\u2019s jurisdiction, Pvt. Wright first contends the particular court-martial that tried and convicted him lacked jurisdiction because it was formed under court-martial convening order (CMCO) nine but his case was originally referred under CMCO seven. Even if this were error, it would not be jurisdictional error. <em>See, e.g., United States v. King, </em>28 M.J. 397, 398-99 (C.M.A.1989); <em>United States v. Emerson, </em>1 C.M.A. 43, 44-45 (1951); <em>United States v. Fields, </em>17 M.J. 1070, 1071 (A.F.C.M.R.1984). Because the military courts already fully and fairly considered this claim, we are unable to review it further. <em>See Roberts, </em>321 F.3d at 997.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-7\">Pvt. Wright next asserts that the convening authority, Col. Hardesty, did not personally appoint one of the court-martial members, Lt. Col. Harmon, as required by 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 825(d)(2). This claim does implicate the court-martial\u2019s jurisdiction, <em>see, e.g., United States v. Ryan, </em>5 M.J. 97, 101 (C.M.A.1978), but nevertheless fails. Col. Hardesty submitted an affidavit to the Army Court of Appeals asserting that he did personally choose Lt. Col. Harmon, although he referred to Lt. Col. Harmon by his command title rather than by his name. Based on that uncontested affidavit, the court found that Col. Hardesty had personally and properly appointed Lt. Col. Harmon to Pvt. Wright\u2019s court-martial. We are not free to reweigh the evidence underlying that factual finding, <em>see, e.g., Dodson v. Zelez, </em>917 F.2d 1250, 1254 (10th Cir.1990), which was sufficient to establish the court-martial\u2019s jurisdiction over Pvt. Wright\u2019s case, <em>see United States v. Allgood, </em>41 M.J. 492, 496 (C.A.A.F.1995) (finding jurisdiction where record showed convening authority did personally select court-martial members).</p>\n<p id=\"b741-8\">Pvt. Wright also argues that the military judge who presided over his trial, Col. Merck, was not properly detailed to that particular court-martial. <em>See generally </em>10 U.S.C. \u00a7 826(c). It is not clear this claim implicates the court-martial\u2019s jurisdiction. <em>Compare United States v. Robinson, </em>43 M.J. 501, 504 (A.F.Ct.Crim.App.1995) (concluding propriety of military judge\u2019s detail is not jurisdictional) <em>with United States v. Hutto, </em>29 M.J. 917, 919 (A.C.M.R.1989) (\u201cProper appointment of the military judge is a jurisdictional prerequisite to the proper composition of a courts-martial [sic].\u201d). Even so, Col. Merck began Pvt. Wright\u2019s trial by declaring that he had been properly detailed, an assertion that has been held sufficient absent contrary evidence. <em>See Hutto, </em>29 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"712\">*712</page-number>M.J. at 918-19. Pvt. Wright failed to present any evidence calling Col. Merck\u2019s assertion into question. <em>Cf. United States v. Price, </em>7 M.J. 644, 645 (A.C.M.R.1979) (rejecting similar claim under prior law); <em>United States v. Shearer, </em>6 M.J. 737, 739 (A.C.M.R.1978) (same, in dicta). Pvt. Wright also failed to object to Col. Merck conducting the trial, a deficiency which waived his right to challenge the judge\u2019s detailing. <em>See Robinson, </em>43 M.J. at 504 (failure to object forfeited challenge to judge\u2019s detailing absent plain error).</p>\n<p id=\"b742-4\">Finally, Pvt. Wright asserts that his court-martial included enlisted members even though he never requested such a panel, in contravention of 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 825(c)(1) (providing for court-martial that includes enlisted members only if accused so requests). We assume this claim implicates the court-martial\u2019s jurisdiction. <em>See United States v. Hood, </em>37 M.J. 784, 785-86 (A.C.M.R.1993); <em>United States v. Acevedo-Colon, </em>2 M.J. 969, 971 (A.C.M.R. 1976). <em>But see Davis v. Lansing, </em>202 F.Supp.2d 1245, 1252-53 (D.Kan.2002) (suggesting the contrary), <em>aff'd, </em>65 Fed. Appx. 197 (10th Cir.2003). Nonetheless, the record specifically indicates that, immediately before trial, Pvt. Wright did request that his court-martial include enlisted members. <em>See </em>Respondent\u2019s Dist. Ct. Answer, attach. 3 at 166. Pvt. Wright conceded that he had made that same request in an earlier pretrial session. <em>See id., </em>attach. 7 at 2 n. 2 (Pvt. Wright\u2019s pro se direct-appeal brief).</p>\n<p id=\"b742-5\">We are thus satisfied that Pvt. Wright\u2019s court-martial had jurisdiction. The judgment of the district court is therefore AFFIRMED. Pvt. Wright\u2019s motion for discovery filed with this court is DENIED.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-6\">The mandate shall issue forthwith.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b740-12\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. The court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b740-14\">. Pvt. Wright asserted an eighth claim in his \u00a7 2241 petition, challenging the Army Court of Appeals' decision to reassess his sentence, rather than remand for a new sentencing proceeding. Pvt. Wright, however, does not reassert that claim before this court. We therefore deem it abandoned.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b740-23\">. In his brief, Pvt. Wright now asserts this claim implicates the court-martial\u2019s jurisdiction, as well as due process. To the extent this claim does implicate the court-martial\u2019s jurisdiction, it does so based only on the same allegations we later address as part of Pvt. Wright's first claim.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
