(Wells Fargo) brought an action in Minnesota state court against Kevin Burns, Barbara Burns, and E-Loan, Inc., arising out of a mortgage dispute, Mr. Burns removed the case to federal court and invoked the Truth in Lending Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1601-1667(e) (TILA) to support the removal. The district court<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> remanded the case to state court based on procedural defects and lack of subject-matter jurisdiction, awarded attorney\u2019s fees to Wells Fargo, and denied a recusal motion filed by Mr. Burns. Mr. Burns appeals. Although we do not have jurisdiction to review the propriety of the remand order, see 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1447(d); <em>Things Remembered, Inc. v. Petrarca, </em>516 U.S. 124, 127-28, 116 S.Ct. 494, 133 L.Ed.2d 461 (1995), we affirm the district court\u2019s award of attorney\u2019s fees and its denial of the recusal motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-23\">Specifically, we find that the district court did not abuse its considerable discretion in awarding attorney\u2019s fees to Wells Fargo under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1447(c), see <em>Hart v. Wal-Mart Stores Inc. Associates\u2019 Health and Welfare Plan, </em>360 F.3d 674, 677 (7th Cir.2004) (attorney\u2019s-fees award under \u00a7 1447(c) is independently appealable order); <em>Children\u2019s Broadcasting Corp. v. Walt Disney Co., </em>357 F.3d 860, 870 (8th Cir.2004) (standard of review); <em>Sirotzky v. New York Stock Exch., </em>347 F.3d 985, 987 (7th Cir.2003). The removal notice was untimely, see 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1446(b); Fed.R.Civ.P. 6(a), and the district court lacked subject-matter jurisdiction, as a federal question did not appear on the face of the complaint and the complete-preemption doctrine does not apply to claims under the TILA, <em>see Caterpillar Inc. v. Williams, </em>482 U.S. 386, 392-93, 107 S.Ct. 2425, 96 L.Ed.2d 318 (1987); <em>Magee v. Exxon Corp., </em>135 F.3d 599, 601-02 (8th Cir.1998). We also find that the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying the recusal motion. <em>See Bannister v. Delo, </em>100 F.3d 610, 614 (8th Cir.1996), <em>cert. denied, </em>521 U.S. 1126, 117 S.Ct. 2526, 138 L.Ed.2d 1026 (1997); <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>47 F.3d 272, 276 (8th Cir.1995) (standard of review).</p>\n<p id=\"b629-24\">Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b629-20\">. The Honorable James M. Rosenbaum, Chief Judge, United States District Court for the District of Minnesota.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
