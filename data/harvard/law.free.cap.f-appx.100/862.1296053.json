She has not shown, as she must, that the conflict of interest generated by First Unum\u2019s dual status as plan administrator and plan insurer \u201caffected the reasonableness of the [administrator\u2019s] decision\u201d to deny her long term disability benefits. <em>See Sullivan v. LTV Aerospace &amp; Def. Co., </em>82 F.3d 1251, 1259 (2d Cir. 1996) (internal quotation marks omitted); <em>see also Pulvers v. First UNUM Life Ins. Co., </em>210 F.3d 89, 92 (2d Cir.2000). The district court was therefore correct to review the defendant\u2019s determination under the more deferential arbitrary and capricious standard. Applying this standard of review, we also cannot say that First Unum\u2019s decision was \u201cwithout reason, unsupported by substantial evidence or erro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"864\">*864</page-number>neous as a matter of law.\u201d <em>Pagan v. NYNEX Pension Plan, 52 </em>F.3d 438, 442 (2d Cir.1995) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b894-4\">We have considered all of appellant\u2019s claims and find them meritless.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Accordingly, we AFFIRM the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b894-5\">. Wagner also asserts that the district court should have afforded her discovery to investigate the effect of First Unum\u2019s conflict of interest on the decision to deny her benefits. Notwithstanding defendant\u2019s contention that such discovery is precluded by our general statement that \"under the arbitrary and capricious standard [a district court] is limited to the administrative record,\u201d <em>Miller v. United Welfare Fund, </em>72 F.3d 1066, 1071 (2d Cir. 1995), discovery may be appropriate in some cases where a petitioner seeks to show a conflict of interest, <em>see Liston v. UNUM Corp. Officer Severance Plan, </em>330 F.3d 19 (1st Cir. 2003) (\"certain kinds of <em>claims </em>\u2014 e.g., proof of corruption \u2014 may in their nature or timing take a reviewing court to materials outside the administrative record\u201d); <em>Farley v. Arkansas Blue Cross &amp; Blue Shield, </em>147 F.3d 774, 776 n. 4 (8th Cir.1998) (noting that \"conducting limited discovery for the purpose of determining the appropriate standard of review does not run afoul of the general prohibition on admitting evidence outside the administrative record for the purpose of determining benefits\u201d). But because Wagner has not shown \"good cause\u201d in support of her request, we affirm the court's decision below denying discoveiy. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 26(b)(1); <em>DeFelice </em>v. <em>American Int'l Life Assur. Co., </em>112 F.3d 61, 66 (2d Cir.1997).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
