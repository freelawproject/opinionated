Craig asks this court to devise a method through which he might challenge a fine and injunction imposed by the district court in 1995.</p>\n<p id=\"b943-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"913\">*913</page-number>Mandamus is a drastic remedy to be used only in extraordinary circumstances. <em>Kerr v. United States Dist. Court, </em>426 U.S. 394, 402, 96 S.Ct. 2119, 48 L.Ed.2d 725 (1976). Mandamus relief is available only when there are no other means by which the relief sought could be granted. <em>In re Beard, </em>811 F.2d 818, 826 (4th Cir.1987). The party seeking mandamus relief carries the heavy burden of showing that he has no other adequate means to obtain the relief he seeks and that his entitlement to relief is clear and indisputable. <em>Allied Chem. Corp. v. Daiflon, Inc., </em>449 U.S. 33, 35, 101 S.Ct. 188, 66 L.Ed.2d 193 (1980). Craig has not made the required showing.</p>\n<p id=\"b943-5\">We deny leave to proceed in forma pauperis and dismiss the mandamus petition. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b943-6\">\n<em>DISMISSED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
