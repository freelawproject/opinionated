Weaver filed a petition for writ of habeas corpus alleging several defects in his trial. The magistrate judge recommended the issuance of a writ for Weaver\u2019s ineffective assistance of trial counsel claim based on the failure of Weaver\u2019s counsel to introduce two statements, which allegedly tended to lessen Weaver\u2019s criminal culpability. The district court declined to issue a writ but granted a certificate of appealability as to three issues: (1) the ineffective assistance of trial counsel claim, (2) an ineffective assistance of appellate counsel claim stemming from the failure of Weaver\u2019s appellate counsel to appeal the trial court\u2019s failure to give a curative instruction after a witness refused to testify on Fifth Amendment grounds, and (3) a claim based on the trial judge\u2019s curtailment of defense counsel\u2019s closing argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-20\">Having studied the record on appeal and the briefs of the parties, we conclude that the judgment of the district court should be AFFIRMED upon the reasoning set out in parts IV.B. D. and E of the district court\u2019s memorandum and order, dated February 8, 2002.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-21\">In its treatment of the ineffective assistance of the trial counsel claim, the district court relied on the reasonableness of the Ohio Court of Appeals regarding the two statements that Weaver claims should have been introduced at trial. While the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>omitted statements may have undermined the theory that Weaver was the \u201ctrigger-man\u201d in this case, the Ohio Court of Appeals reasonably concluded that in any event \u201ca rational jury could have found [Weaver] guilty beyond reasonable doubt as an aider and abettor, regardless of whether [Weaver] was present and regardless of whether [Roderick] Parks was actually the triggerman.\u201d <em>Ohio v. Weaver, </em>No. 97-L-209, 1998 WL 964594, at *6 (Ohio Ct.App. Dec 18, 1998) (emphasis omitted). We note that the district court\u2019s reliance on the state court\u2019s reasoning in this regard is supported by the fact that, in Ohio, a defendant who is charged as a principal can be convicted as an aider and abettor. <em>See </em>Ohio Rev.Code \u00a7 2923.03; <em>Ohio v. Tumbleson, </em>105 Ohio App.3d 693, 664 N.E.2d 1318, 1320-21 (Ohio Ct.App.1995).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
