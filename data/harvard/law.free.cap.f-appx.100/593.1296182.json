For reversal, Politt argues the administrative law judge (ALJ) erred in not considering his impairments in combination, in discounting his subjective complaints, in not developing the record further as to his past relevant work (PRAY) and mental impairments, and in determining his residual functional capacity (RFC). For the reasons discussed below, we affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-22\">We conclude that substantial evidence supports the ALJ\u2019s findings. <em>See Roberts v. Apfel, </em>222 F.3d 466, 468 (8th Cir.2000) (standard of review). The ALJ summarized the medical evidence and specifically determined that Politt\u2019s impairments\u2014 alone or combined \u2014 did not meet the listing-level requirements. <em>See Hajek v. Shalala, </em>30 F.3d 89, 92 (8th Cir.1994). In rejecting Politt\u2019s subjective complaints, the ALJ appropriately considered Politt\u2019s daily activities, and noted that medication had helped with Politt\u2019s depression and anxiety and that Politt had failed to seek medical treatment after May 2001. <em>See Lowe v. Apfel, </em>226 F.3d 969, 972 (8th Cir.2000) (if adequately explained and supported, credi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>bility findings are for ALJ to make). The ALJ did not need to develop the record further as to Politt\u2019s PRW once the ALJ determined that Politt could not return to it, and the ALJ followed the proper procedure in evaluating Politt\u2019s mental impairments. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.920a (2004). Finally, we have found nothing in the record to contradict the ALJ\u2019s RFC finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-4\">Politt raises additional points in his brief. We find them to be meritless and affirm without further discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-5\">Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b623-16\">. The Honorable Bobby E. Shepherd, United States Magistrate Judge for the Western District of Arkansas, to whom the case was referred for final disposition by consent of the parties pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636(c).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
