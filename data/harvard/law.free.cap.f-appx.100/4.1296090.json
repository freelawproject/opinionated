The district court treated the filing as a \u00a7 2254 petition and dismissed it as nonconforming, successive, and untimely. We already have held that Brennan may not bring a \u201csecond or successive\u201d \u00a7 2254 petition because he cannot satisfy the requirements of \u00a7 2244(b). Therefore, the only question before us is whether the district court properly denied relief under \u00a7 2241 and \u00a7 1651. Our review is <em>de novo. Saint Fort v. Ashcroft, </em>329 F.3d 191, 202 (1st Cir.2003). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-22\">A state habeas petitioner in custody pursuant to the judgment of a state court may not evade the \u201csecond or successive\u201d restrictions of \u00a7 2244 by bringing his petition under \u00a7 2241 rather than \u00a7 2254. <em>See, e.g., Medberry v. Crosby, </em>351 F.3d 1049, 1060-61 (11th Cir.2003), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 124 S.Ct. 2098, 158 L.Ed.2d 714 (2004) (No. 03-9165); <em>Cook v. New York State Division of Parole, </em>321 F.3d 274, 278-79 <em>&amp; </em>n. 4 (2d Cir.2003); <em>Coady v. Vaughn, </em>251 F.3d 480, 484-85 (3d Cir.2001). As the Third Circuit explained, \u201cboth Sections 2241 and 2254 authorize [petitioner\u2019s] challenge to the legality of his continued state custody,\u201d but allowing him to file his \u201cpetition in federal court pursuant to Section 2241 without reliance on Section 2254 would ... thwart Congressional intent.\u201d <em>Coady, </em>251 F.3d at 484-85. Thus, a state prisoner in custody pursuant to the judgment of a state court may file a habeas corpus petition, as authorized by \u00a7 2241, but he is limited by \u00a7 2254. <em>Cf. United States v. Barrett, </em>178 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>F.3d 34, 49-50 (1st Cir.1999), <em>cert. denied, 528 </em>U.S. 1176, 120 S.Ct. 1208, 145 L.Ed.2d 1110 (2000) (holding that federal prisoner could not evade restrictions on successive \u00a7 2255 petitions by resort to \u00a7 2241).</p>\n<p id=\"b35-5\">Nor may the All Writs Act, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1651, be used to evade the strictures of \u00a7 2254. \u201cThe All Writs Act is a residual source of authority to issue writs that are not otherwise covered by statute. Where a statute specifically addresses the particular issue at hand, it is that authority, and not the All Writs Act, that is controlling.\u201d <em>Carlisle v. United States, </em>517 U.S. 416, 429, 116 S.Ct. 1460,134 L.Ed.2d 613 (1996) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). As noted above, because Brennan is in custody pursuant to the judgment of a state court, his request for relief is governed by \u00a7 2254. Because a \u00a7 2254 petition is available to him, a writ under \u00a7 1651 is not. <em>See, e.g., Godoski v. United States, </em>304 F.3d 761, 762 (7th Cir.2002), <em>cert. denied, </em>537 U.S. 1211, 123 S.Ct. 1304, 154 L.Ed.2d 1059 (2003); <em>cf. Barrett, </em>178 F.3d at 55 (holding that federal prisoner could not evade restrictions on successive \u00a7 2255 petitions by resort to \u00a7 1651).</p>\n<p id=\"b35-7\">Accordingly, the district court properly treated Brennan\u2019s petition as having been brought under \u00a7 2254, despite Brennan\u2019s attempt to classify his petition as a \u00a7 2241 or \u00a7 1651 action.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-8\">The judgment of the district court is <em>affirmed. See </em>1st Cir. R. 27(c).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
