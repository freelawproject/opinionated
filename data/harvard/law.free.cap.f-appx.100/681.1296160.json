The district court found IDS\u2019 violations to be both serious and deliberate. It was within the discretion of the district court to find that these factors called for an award of maximum statutory damages. Because these factors were sufficient to justify an award of maximum statutory damages, we decline to decide the question of whether a court may consider a collection agency\u2019s violations involving other debtors in its determination of whether the agency has acted with \u201cfrequency and persistence\u201d within the meaning of 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1692k(b)(l).</p>\n<p id=\"b712-12\">The district court did not award excessive attorneys\u2019 fees. 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1692k(a)(3) provides that in any successful action to enforce liability, plaintiff shall collect \u201cthe costs of the action, together with a reasonable attorney\u2019s fee as determined by the court.\u201d A Special Master reduced the submitted attorneys\u2019 fees to reflect only those claims on which plaintiff prevailed. The Supreme Court has held that in reducing an award of attorneys\u2019 fees, \u201c[t]here is no precise rule or formula for making these determinations. The district court may attempt to identify specific hours that should be eliminated, or it may simply reduce the award to account for the limited success.\u201d <em>Hensley v. Eckerhart, </em>461 U.S. 424, 436-37, 103 S.Ct. 1933, 76 L.Ed.2d 40 (1983). The district court\u2019s reduction fell within these guidelines.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-13\">We award King additional attorneys\u2019 fees and costs for this appeal. The language of 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1692k(a)(3) allows for attorneys\u2019 fees and costs in \u201cany successful action to enforce the foregoing liability!)]\u201d King\u2019s response to IDS\u2019 appeal was necessary to defend the judgment below awarding damages. This circuit has interpreted the same statutory language to allow for attorneys\u2019 fees and costs on appeal in the Truth in Lending Act. <em>Dias v. Bank of Hawaii, </em>732 F.2d 1401, 1403 (9th Cir.1984) (interpreting 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1640(a)(3)). This court will determine the fee award after receiving the appropriate documentation.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-14\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b712-10\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
