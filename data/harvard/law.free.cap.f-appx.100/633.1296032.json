Bridgewater contends that the district court erred in dismissing his petition as untimely without conducting a factual inquiry into his claim that he was entitled to equitable tolling as a result of his mental retardation and organic brain damage. We agree and reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-11\">We are guided by our recent decision in <em>Laws v. Lamarque, </em>351 F.3d 919 (9th Cir.2003). In <em>Laws, </em>we held that the prisoner\u2019s allegation of mental incompetency in a verified pleading attached to his traverse was sufficient to require the district court to allow discovery or order expansion of the factual record with respect to the issue of equitable tolling of the applicable one-year statute of limitations. We emphasized that the prisoner did not carry a burden of persuasion in order to warrant further investigation into the merits of his arguments for tolling:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b664-14\">Rather, our cases require only that there be \u201ccircumstances consistent with petitioner\u2019s petition ... under which he would be entitled to a finding of an \u2018impediment\u2019 under \u00a7 2244(d)(1)(B) or to equitable tolling\u201d for further factual development to be required.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b664-15\"><em>Id. </em>at 924 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b664-16\">In opposing the motion to dismiss, Bridgewater referred to the portion of his July 12, 2001 habeas petition, filed in the California Court of Appeal, that explained that any delay in raising his state claims was caused in part because he was \u201cmentally retarted [sic].\u201d A copy of this state petition, which was signed under penalty of perjury, was before the district court. In addition, in his objections to the magistrate judge\u2019s findings and recommendations, Bridgewater explained that his \u201corganic brain damage\u201d was the \u201cnumber one reason for extraordinary circumstances,\u201d and that it took him \u201cthis period of time to formulate this presentation because of petitioner\u2019s condition.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b664-17\">Under <em>Laws, </em>Bridgewater\u2019s allegation that he was unable to file his petition within the limitations period due to his mental retardation and organic brain damage was sufficient to trigger the district court\u2019s duty to conduct a factual inquiry into the merits of his equitable tolling claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-18\">We reverse the district court\u2019s judgment dismissing Bridgewater\u2019s habeas petition and remand so that the district court may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"635\">*635</page-number>order such discovery, expansion of the record, or evidentiary hearing as necessary to determine whether Bridgewater is entitled to equitable tolling. We also suggest that the district court appoint counsel for Bridgewater.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-5\">REVERSED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b664-12\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
