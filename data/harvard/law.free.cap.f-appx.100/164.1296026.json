See Local Rule 36(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b194-25\">Kevin Maurice Linder pled guilty to escape, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 751 (2000), and was sentenced as a career offender to forty months imprisonment. <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 4B1.1 (2003). Linder challenges the district court\u2019s determination that escape is a crime of violence as defined in \u00a7 4B1.2(a)(2) <em>&amp; </em>comment, (n.l). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-26\">Linder argues on appeal that this court should reconsider a number of its prior decisions. Linder first takes issue with this Court\u2019s decision in <em>United States v. Dickerson, </em>77 F.3d 774, 776 (4th Cir.1996) (holding that felony attempted escape is a crime of violence under \u00a7 4B1.1), and challenges the categorical approach we have adopted for determining whether an offense is a crime of violence under the \u201cotherwise\u201d clause of \u00a7 4B1.2(a)(2). <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>953 F.2d 110, 114-15 (4th Cir.1991)). Linder also contends that this court erred in deciding <em>United States v. Kinter, </em>235 F.3d 192, 195 (4th Cir.2000) (holding that <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), does not apply to the sentencing guidelines). He argues that due process requires that any fact resulting in a sentence enhancement be proved beyond a reasonable doubt <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>and by evidence admissible at trial. Because a panel of this court may not overrule the decision of a prior panel, <em>Brubaker v. City of Richmond, </em>943 F.2d 1363, 1381-82 (4th Cir.1991), his argument fails in each instance.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-5\">Linder further maintains that the Sentencing Commission violated the Due Process Clause by defining a crime of violence in terms different from those used in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 16(b) (2000). Section 16(b) differs from \u00a7 4B1.2(a)(2) in that \u00a7 16(b) states that a crime of violence may be \u201cany other offense that is a felony and that, by its nature, involves a substantial risk that physical force against the person or property of another may be used in the course of committing the offense,\u201d while \u00a7 4B1.2(a)(2) provides that a crime of violence may be an offense that \u201cotherwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.\u201d The commentary to \u00a7 4B1.2 clarifies the guideline by stating that the offense may be one that, \u201cby its nature, presented a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.\u201d Our prior decisions hold that the discrepancy between \u00a7 16 and \u00a7 4B1.1 is not significant. <em>See United States v. Martin, </em>215 F.3d 470, 474 n. 4 (4th Cir.2000) (noting that, \u201cthe definition in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 16 uses operative language that is similar to that used in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2(a). Thus, our determinations regarding what constitutes a crime of violence for purposes of 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 16 are also relevant [for career offender determination]\u201d); <em>United States v. Wilson, </em>951 F.2d 586, 588 (4th Cir.1991) (modification of guideline language that deviated from \u00a7 16 definition of crime of violence did not alter scope of court\u2019s inquiry into nature of offense).</p>\n<p id=\"b195-6\">We therefore affirm the sentence imposed by the district court. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-8\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
