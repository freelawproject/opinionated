Harvey argues (1) that \u00a7 922(g), as applied in this case, violates the Commerce Clause, and (2) that the trial court violated Fed.R.Evid. 404(b) by admitting evidence that showed trace amounts of cocaine were found during a search of Harvey\u2019s apartment.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-25\">Harvey concedes that his Commerce Clause argument is foreclosed by this court\u2019s precedent but raises the issue to preserve it for Supreme Court review.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b292-26\">Following a hearing, the district court granted the Government\u2019s Rule 404(b) motion to admit the drug evidence on the grounds that it established a motive for Harvey to possess the firearms and that it suggested that he had knowledge of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>firearms\u2019 presence in the apartment. Although Harvey argued in his opposition to the pre-trial motion that the drug evidence was irrelevant and likely to confuse and prejudice the jury, he did not object when the drug evidence was offered at trial. Accordingly, we review his challenge to the admission of the drug evidence for plain error.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b293-5\">We will reverse a conviction for plain error only if there is a clear or obvious error that affects substantial rights.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Even then, we retain the discretion to correct such errors, and we will do so only if the errors seriously affect the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b293-6\">Even if Harvey could demonstrate clear or obvious error, we must affirm Harvey\u2019s conviction because the admission of the drug evidence did not violate his substantial rights.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The indictment charged that Harvey violated \u00a7\u00a7 922(g)(1) and 924(a)(2) by possessing \u201cone or more firearms, namely, a Smith &amp; Wesson .357 caliber handgun and a Mossberg .410 shotgun.\u201d Harvey does not dispute that he is a convicted felon and that the charged firearms had traveled in interstate commerce. Accordingly, proof that Harvey possessed either firearm is sufficient to support his conviction.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The undisputed evidence shows that the loaded Smith &amp; Wesson .357 revolver was on the closet shelf in Harvey\u2019s bedroom and that Harvey told the officers that he had placed the weapon there. This evidence is more than adequate to support Harvey\u2019s conviction.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Aecordingly, his substantial rights were not affected by the admission of the evidence of cocaine residue.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-14\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b292-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
