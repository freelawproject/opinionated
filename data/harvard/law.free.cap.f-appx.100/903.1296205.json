We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b934-11\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b934-12\">Roseline Kalili\u2019s daughter stole checks made payable to various vendors serving her employer. Kalili became involved with the criminal scheme at issue when her daughter brought the checks home, forged the payee\u2019s indorsement onto the back of the checks, and designated Kalili as the new payee. Kalili indorsed the checks by signing her name and affixing her social security number on the back of the checks.</p>\n<p id=\"b934-13\">The two women deposited into Kalili\u2019s account a single \u201ctest\u201d check in the amount of approximately $1600. Before the deposit, Kalili had less than $10 in this account. After the check cleared, Kalili and her daughter made several cash withdrawals and made purchases at two stores. They later attempted to deposit more than $800,000 worth of checks into Kalili\u2019s account. The bank quickly detected these obviously suspicious transactions, refused to honor the checks, and contacted the authorities. Kalili immediately entered a plea of guilty to bank fraud, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1344, and waived her right to an indictment. Kalili\u2019s base offense level was six for bank fraud, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Bl.l(a), but because the intended loss exceeded $800,000, her base offense level was increased by 14 points. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Bl.l(b)(l)(H). She received a three-level adjustment for acceptance of responsibility, and because she had no prior criminal history, her adjusted base offense level was 17.</p>\n<p id=\"b934-14\">At sentencing, the district court identified alternative grounds for a downward <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"905\">*905</page-number>departure \u2014 aberrant behavior and a finding that the offense level of 17 substantially overstated the seriousness of the crime. U.S.S.G. \u00a7\u00a7 5K2.20; 2B1.1, App. Note 18(C). The court set Kalili\u2019s offense level at 12, and sentenced her to ten months in prison. Without the downward departure, Kalili\u2019s sentencing range would have been from 24 to 30 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b935-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b935-6\">The Prosecutorial Remedies and Tools against the Exploitation of Children Today Act of 2003, Pub.L. No. 108-21, 117 Stat. 650, (PROTECT Act), changed the standard of review we employ in reviewing a district court\u2019s decision to depart. Before the PROTECT Act, a district court\u2019s decision to depart was reviewed for abuse of discretion. <em>Koon v. United States, </em>518 U.S. 81, 96-100, 116 S.Ct. 2035, 135 L.Ed.2d 392 (1996). Under the PROTECT Act, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3742(e)(3) and (4) (as amended April 30, 2003), if the sentence falls outside the guidelines\u2019 range, we review de novo the district court\u2019s application of the Guidelines to the facts to decide whether the departure is based on a factor that (1) advances the objectives of federal sentencing policy, (2) is authorized under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(b), and (3) is justified by the facts of the case. <em>United States v. Pressley, </em>345 F.3d 1205, 1209 n. 1 (11th Cir.2003).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>See also United States v. May, </em>359 F.3d 683, 687-88 (4th Cir.2004) (holding that we review the district court\u2019s factual determinations and the ultimate decision to depart downward de novo); <em>United States v. Stockton, </em>349 F.3d 755, 764 (4th Cir.2003) (same), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 124 S.Ct. 1695, 158 L.Ed.2d 385 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b935-10\">Reviewing de novo, we find that the district court did not err in departing downward. As indicated, the district court departed downward on two alternative bases. The departure for aberrant behavior is a close call. To qualify as \u201caberrant behavior,\u201d the offense must be a single criminal occurrence or single criminal transaction of limited duration, committed without significant planning, and must represent a marked deviation from the defendant\u2019s usual law-abiding behavior. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K2.20(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b935-11\">Here, Kalili\u2019s conduct arguably involved more than a single transaction and substantial planning. The \u201ctest\u201d deposit was made several days before the outrageously large deposit. <em>Cf. United States v. Glick, </em>946 F.2d 335, 338 (4th Cir.1991) (holding that five letters containing misappropriated, confidential information over the course of ten weeks was more than a single transaction).</p>\n<p id=\"b935-12\">Notwithstanding this concern, we find that the district court was on more solid ground in departing downward because Kalili\u2019s offense level substantially overstated the seriousness of the offense. Kalili\u2019s offense level was increased by 14 points based on an \u201cintended loss\u201d of between $400,000 and $1,000,000. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Bl.l(b)(l)(H). If the loss was calculated at less than $5,000, (the restitution loss to the bank was $1135.28), the offense level would not have increased, and would have settled at three after the acceptance-of-responsibility adjustment.</p>\n<p id=\"b936-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"906\">*906</page-number>The Guidelines do expressly provide for such a situation. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B1.1, App. Note 3(A) (defining \u201closs\u201d as \u201cthe greater of actual loss or intended loss,\u201d and defining \u201cintended loss\u201d as \u201cthe pecuniary harm that was intended to result from the offense ... including] intended pecuniary harm that would have been impossible or unlikely to occur.\u201d). However, Application Note 18(C) to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B1.1 also provides: \u201cThere may be cases in which the offense level determined under this guideline substantially overstates the seriousness of the offense. In such cases, a downward departure may be warranted.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b936-4\">We agree with the district court that this was one of those cases contemplated by the Sentencing Commission. While Kalili\u2019s offense level was correctly increased to 17 based on an intended loss of over $800,000, it is clear that this was not an $800,000 case. Not surprisingly, Kalili did not significantly profit from her daughter\u2019s ill-conceived scheme before they were caught. She withdrew some cash and also made a debit card purchase at Wal-Mart. At the time of sentencing, she had made nearly full restitution. In light of the foregoing, we find the district court did not err in departing downward in this case. <em>Cf. United States v. Corry, </em>206 F.3d 748, 751 (7th Cir.2000) (holding that loss overstating the seriousness of the offense is \u201can encouraged basis for departure\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b936-5\">Kalili\u2019s sentence advances the objectives of federal sentencing policy, is authorized by law, and is justified by the facts of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b936-6\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b935-7\">. The PROTECT Act also requires a court of appeals to set aside a sentence if the district court failed to provide a written statement of the reasons for its departure. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(e)(3)(A), (f)(2)(B). Here, the record on appeal does not contain such a statement. However, because the parties have not raised the issue and because we review de novo the application of the Guidelines to the facts even when the court fails to provide a written statement of reasons, we will assess whether the departure was justified by the facts of the case. <em>United States v. May, </em>359 F.3d 683, 688 n. 5 (4th Cir.2004).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
