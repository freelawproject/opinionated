Boggs\u2019s only contention is that the district court abused its discretion by denying his request for a third evaluation to determine his competence to stand trial. We find no abuse of discretion and therefore affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-24\">\u201cThe conviction of a defendant when he is legally incompetent is a violation of due <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>process.\u201d <em>United States v. Mason, </em>52 F.3d 1286, 1289 (4th Cir.1995). The district court must order a competency hearing under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4241(a) (2000) if there is reasonable cause to believe the defendant may presently be suffering from a mental defect rendering him incompetent to stand trial. \u201cThe test for mental competence is whether the defendant \u2018has sufficient present ability to consult with his lawyer with a reasonable degree of rational understanding and whether he has a rational as well as factual understanding of the proceedings against him.\u2019 \u201d <em>Mason, </em>52 F.3d at 1289 (quoting <em>Dusky v. United States, </em>362 U.S. 402, 402, 80 S.Ct. 788, 4 L.Ed.2d 824 (1960) (per curiam)); <em>see also </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4241(a). Indicia of competence can include a defendant\u2019s behavior, his demeanor at trial, and any medical opinion on competence. <em>Mason, </em>52 F.3d at 1290 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b219-5\">This court\u2019s review of a district court\u2019s refusal to order a competency determination is for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. West, </em>877 F.2d 281, 285 n. 1 (4th Cir.1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b219-6\">Two previous psychological examinations had concluded that Boggs was competent to stand trial. At a hearing on the motion for a third evaluation of Boggs\u2019s competency, which the district court conducted with great care and thoughtfulness, Boggs demonstrated an understanding of the legal system and of the nature of the charges against him. Boggs argues, as he did to the district court, that his rejection of the government\u2019s offer of a favorable plea agreement was influenced by the delusions already explored fully in the two previous psychological examinations. The district court conducted an extended colloquy with Boggs and gave thorough consideration to this argument, concluding that Boggs\u2019s rejection of the plea agreement was supported by a rational thought process and that Boggs was able to assess his options with a \u201c \u2018reasonable degree of rational understanding.\u2019 \u201d <em>Mason, </em>52 F.3d at 1289 (quoting <em>Dusky, </em>362 U.S. at 402, 80 S.Ct. 788). In the circumstances presented here, we cannot say the district court erred in determining there was no reasonable cause to believe Boggs was incompetent to stand trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-8\">Accordingly, we affirm Boggs\u2019s conviction and sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-9\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
