He argues that: the disputed issues identified by the district court are not material to the qualified immunity determination; the evidence establishes without dispute that Jerry Lynn Anderson posed an immediate and serious threat to him; and his actions were reasonable in light of the threat posed by Anderson. Hooper further argues that the district court erred when it denied his motion for summary judgment with respect to the state-law claim advanced by the plaintiffs because that claim is barred, as a matter of law, by Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem. \u00a7 101.106.</p>\n<p id=\"b1030-7\">Although Hooper asserts that his appeal is a challenge to the materiality of the disputed factual issues identified by the district court, his arguments concern the genuineness of those factual disputes. <em>See Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., </em>477 U.S. 242, 248, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 91 L.Ed.2d 202 (1986). Consequently, this court lacks jurisdiction to consider Hooper\u2019s appeal from the denial of summary judgment with respect to whether he is entitled to qualified immunity. <em>See Reyes v. City of Richmond, Tex., </em>287 F.3d 346, 350 (5th Cir. 2002).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1030-10\">Because the determination whether Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem. \u00a7 101.106 bars the state-law claim advanced by the plaintiffs is neither \u201cinextricably intertwined\u201d nor necessary to resolve the question of qualified immunity, this court lacks jurisdiction to consider Hooper\u2019s appeal of the denial of summary judgment as to this issue. <em>See Cantu v. Rocha, </em>77 F.3d 795, 805 (5th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b1030-11\">APPEAL DISMISSED FOR LACK OF JURISDICTION; REMANDED TO THE DISTRICT COURT.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b1030-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1030-9\">. Hooper correctly argues, however, that whether he and Officer Mu\u00f1oz identified themselves as law enforcement officers raises no material issue in the immunity calculus, <em>see Fraire v. City of Arlington, </em>957 F.2d 1268 (5th Cir.1992), although if the jury believes they did so identify themselves, it would enhance Hooper\u2019s argument that Anderson intended to run him down.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
