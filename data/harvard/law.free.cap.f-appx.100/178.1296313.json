Cook appeals the district court\u2019s order granting the Defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss his complaint, which was properly construed as arising under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 (2000). We find the district court improperly granted the Defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss \u201cas unopposed.\u201d Cook filed a \u201cMotion For Appointment Of Counsel/Move For a Bench Trial,\u201d in which he clearly argued against the Defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss. Thus, although Cook did not caption his pleading as a brief in opposition to the Defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss, it should have been construed as such by the district court. For the following reasons, however, we find the district court\u2019s grant of the Defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss was appropriate on alternate grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>The Defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss was premised upon a failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6) and lack of subject matter jurisdiction pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(1). We review a district court\u2019s grant of a motion to dismiss pursuant to both Rule 12(b)(6) and Rule 12(b)(1) de novo. <em>Duckworth v. State Admin. Bd. of Election Laws, </em>332 F.3d 769, 772 (4th Cir.2003) (with regard to 12(b)(6)); <em>Evans v. B.F. Perkins Co., </em>166 F.3d 642, 647 (4th Cir.1999) (with regard to 12(b)(1)).</p>\n<p id=\"b210-4\">The relevant facts, viewed in the light most favorable to Cook, can be summarized as follows. After Cook and a classmate obtained information regarding the location of the classmate\u2019s towed vehicle, they proceeded to the lower level of a parking garage on the campus of Morgan State University, where Cook\u2019s vehicle was located. Upon seeing Defendant James, Cook\u2019s classmate inquired why other vehicles that had been ticketed were not towed. Defendant James cursed at them and told them to leave. After entering Cook\u2019s vehicle, Cook and the classmate noticed Defendant James\u2019s partner, Lou Lou Williams, standing approximately fifteen feet in front of them. Cook also noticed Defendant James was issuing parking citations on the lower level of the parking garage. As Cook and the classmate proceeded to exit the garage, \u201call of a sudden five to seven Morgan State University Police vehicles converged on [his] vehicle and proceeded to remove [him] \u2018forcefully.\u2019 \u201d Officer Jake Harrison \u201cforcefully\u201d handcuffed Cook while pressing him against the police vehicle and waited for Defendant James to finish issuing parking citations. Cook was detained \u201cwell over three minutes\u201d before Defendant James arrived at the location where he was handcuffed. When Officer Harrison asked Defendant James what happened, James replied \u201che has a slick mouth.\u201d Officer Harrison responded, \u201cNo, that\u2019s not what I\u2019m asking you, did he hit you!\u201d The Defendant paused for a moment and glanced around at his fellow officers before responding, \u201cYes, he assaulted me!\u201d Cook was thereupon processed and incarcerated on the charge of second-degree assault.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-7\">In order to sustain a \u00a7 1983 claim, a plaintiff must prove that he or she was deprived of a constitutional right by a defendant acting under color of state law. <em>Adickes v. S.H. Kress &amp; Co., </em>398 U.S. 144, 150, 90 S.Ct. 1598, 26 L.Ed.2d 142 (1970). It is well-settled that Cook also must establish that Defendant James was personally involved in the deprivation of his constitutional rights in order to sustain a claim under \u00a7 1983. <em>Wright v. Collins, </em>766 F.2d 841, 850 (4th Cir.1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b210-8\">In a dissenting opinion, Judge Phillips has observed that \u00a7 1983 allows the imposition of liability upon actors more remote than those who actually inflict the ultimate constitutional injury, where their own conduct can be said to have played a significant role in \u201ccausing\u201d that injury.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> <em>Wilkes v. Young, </em>28 F.3d 1362, 1376 (4th Cir.1994), (citing <em>Monell v. New York City Dep\u2019t of Social Servs., </em>436 U.S. 658, 692, 98 S.Ct. 2018, 56 L.Ed.2d 611 (1978)). We conclude Defendant James should be considered such a remote actor because his alleged statement to Officer Harrison that Cook assaulted him led directly to Cook\u2019s arrest, the act Cook asserts violated his constitutional rights. Nonetheless, we find because Cook claims this action constituted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>a violation of his Fourteenth Amendment right to equal protection, he fails to state a claim pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6). \u201cTo succeed on an equal protection claim, a plaintiff must ... demonstrate that he has been treated differently from others with whom he is similarly situated and that the unequal treatment was the result of intentional or purposeful discrimination.\u201d <em>Morrison v. Garraghty, </em>239 F.3d 648, 654 (4th Cir.2001). We find Cook failed to state a valid equal protection claim because he did not assert he was treated differently from others with whom he was similarly situated. For the foregoing reasons, we conclude Cook fails to state a claim upon which relief may be granted pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6).</p>\n<p id=\"b211-5\">Cook also filed suit against the Morgan State Police Department (\u201cMSPD\u201d), apparently seeking to hold it liable under a theory of respondeat superi- or. It is well-settled that respondeat superior generally is inapplicable to \u00a7 1983 lawsuits. <em>Monell, </em>436 U.S. at 694, 98 S.Ct. 2018. However, because Cook cannot state a claim against Defendant James, it is unnecessary to consider whether the MSPD may be held hable under such a theory.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-6\">Finally, we find that because the dismissal of Cook\u2019s \u00a7 1983 action was proper, the district court correctly exercised its discretion to decline to confer supplemental jurisdiction over Cook\u2019s state law claims. Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1367(c)(3) (2000), a district court may decline to exercise supplemental jurisdiction when, as here, all of the claims over which it has original jurisdiction have been dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-7\">Based on the foregoing reasons, we conclude the district court\u2019s dismissal of Cook\u2019s complaint was proper, although on alternate grounds. Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s judgment. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-9\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b210-5\"> The majority opinion in <em>Wilkes v. Young </em>did not reach the question regarding the scope of \u00a7 1983 liability. Thus, Judge Phillips\u2019s view that individuals, other than the individual who directly inflicted the constitutional injury, can be held liable under \u00a7 1983, was not addressed by the majority.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
