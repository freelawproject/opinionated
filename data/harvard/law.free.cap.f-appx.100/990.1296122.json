In his petition he asserted a claim that he was a national of the United States. The district court transferred Dorival\u2019s habeas corpus petition to this court. Dorival requests a stay of removal; that request is DENIED. The Respondent, Attorney General Ashcroft, moves for dismissal of the case for lack of jurisdiction and, in the alternative, for summary affirmance. Ashcroft\u2019s motion for summary affirmance is DENIED. Do-rival moves for leave to file an out-of-time response to Ashcroft\u2019s motion for summary affirmance; Dorival\u2019s motion is DENIED.</p>\n<p id=\"b1021-10\">28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1631 permits a transfer if this court would have been able to exercise jurisdiction on the date that the case was filed in the district court, the district court lacked jurisdiction over the case, and the transfer is in the interest of justice. Dorival filed his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 petition in the district court before he exhausted his administrative remedies before the Board of Immigration Appeals. Therefore, this court could not have exercised jurisdiction over the petition on the date that Dorival filed the petition in district court. <em>See Goonsuwan v. Ashcroft, </em>252 F.3d 383, 387 (5th Cir.2001); 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(d)(1) (a court may review a final order of removal only if the alien has exhausted all administrative remedies as of right).</p>\n<p id=\"b1021-15\">DISMISSED for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b1021-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
