An immigration judge denied Ago\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>application, concluding that he was not credible and, alternatively, that he failed to establish past persecution. The Board of Immigration Appeals affirmed without reaching the IJ\u2019s credibility determination, instead agreeing that Ago failed to establish past persecution. Ago petitions for review of the agency\u2019s decision. We deny the petition for review, because Ago failed to establish that he suffered persecution by the Albanian government.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-5\">Ago is a 38-year-old man from Albania. In 1998 he entered the United States by wading across the Rio Grande River and crossing the border near Brownsville, Texas. Shortly thereafter he was arrested by border patrol agents. When the former Immigration and Naturalization Service initiated removal proceedings against him, Ago conceded deportability but applied for asylum. Specifically, Ago claimed that he had been harassed, threatened, shot at, and beaten because of his work as an organizer for the Democratic Party. The following account is taken from Ago\u2019s testimony at the hearing before the IJ.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-6\">Ago became a member of the Democratic Party in 1991 and worked as an \u201corganizer.\u201d He lived with his family in a small village, where he actively recruited people to his party. During the week he worked as a farmer, but on the weekends he would talk to others in the village about \u201cdemocratic ideas.\u201d Most of the villagers, however, were members of the Socialist Party. Ago claims that he was repeatedly threatened by members of the Socialist Party to stop his political activities.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-7\">Conditions in Albania were unstable in the 1990s, and in 1997 the government essentially collapsed. Many people had weapons, and there was little police protection. Ago fled to Greece three different times \u2014 in 1992, 1994, and 1996 \u2014 when the violence in Albania escalated to the point that he no longer felt safe. Each time he stayed in Greece for a few months. On his final trip Ago stayed in Greece from about December 1996 to June 1997. While he was gone Albania held a national election, and the Socialist Party prevailed. Ago testified that he was afraid to return to Albania to participate in the election because of the threats he had received, but that upon his return he continued to organize for his party. Specifically, he testified that he held meetings and told other villagers that the election results had been manipulated.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-9\">Ago claimed that his neighbor, Valter, a member of the Socialist Party, frequently threatened him regarding his political activities, telling him \u201cone day I am going to kill you.\u201d Valter\u2019s threats escalated and in September 1997, shortly after the national election, Valter came to Ago\u2019s house, knocked on the window, and demanded that he come out. Valter took out a gun and shot at Ago, missing him by about three feet. Ago was able to escape, and slept at his cousin\u2019s house for several days. Ago reported the incident to police, but to Ago\u2019s knowledge Valter was never arrested. He believed that the police were protecting Valter because they were also members of the Socialist Party.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-10\">A few months later, Ago was walking home at night when he was accosted by a group of masked men. The men told him to stop his organizing activities and then beat him, hitting him with their rifles and kicking him repeatedly. They left him unconscious in the road. Some villagers took him to his cousin\u2019s house; he was covered in blood, but he did not go to the hospital because he felt it was too dangerous. In March 1998 Ago decided to leave Albania. Ago decided that Greece was not any safer; a friend who was active in the Democratic Party had been killed in Greece when terrorists burned down his house. Ago flew to the Dominican Repub<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>lie and hitch-hiked his way through much of Latin America, ultimately reaching the U.S. border. Ago testified that he feared he would be killed if he returned to Albania.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-4\">The IJ denied Ago\u2019s asylum application, finding that his account was not credible. The IJ gave several reasons for disbelieving Ago. He first pointed out that Ago had presented \u201cvery little corroborative evidence that he ever was a prominent person in the Democratic Party,\u201d except for a letter showing that he had been a member of the party since 1991. The IJ also noted discrepancies between Ago\u2019s written asylum application and his in-court testimony. Alternatively the IJ concluded that, assuming Ago\u2019s testimony was truthful, he had failed to establish past persecution. Relying on a State Department country report, the IJ concluded that Ago had not shown \u201cspecial circumstances that go beyond the general danger and violence affecting everyone.\u201d The BIA affirmed without reaching the IJ\u2019s credibility determination, instead agreeing with the IJ\u2019s alternative holding that Ago failed to establish past persecution. Ago filed a timely petition for review with this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-5\">We review the BIA\u2019s order under the substantial evidence test and will affirm so long as the BIA\u2019s determination is supported by \u201creasonable, substantial, and probative\u201d evidence in the administrative record as a whole. <em>INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 481, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992); <em>Ahmed v. Ashcroft, </em>348 F.3d 611, 615 (7th Cir.2003). The Attorney General has discretion to grant asylum to an alien who is a \u201crefugee.\u201d A refugee is one who is unwilling or unable to return home \u201cbecause of persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42)(A); <em>Krouchevski v. Ashcroft, </em>344 F.3d 670, 671 (7th Cir.2003). Persecution means more than mere harassment and may arise from such actions as detention, arrest, interrogation, beatings, torture, or threats of death. <em>Oforji v. Ashcroft, </em>354 F.3d 609, 613 (7th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b582-7\">The BIA\u2019s determination that Ago failed to establish past persecution is supported by substantial evidence. Ago\u2019s testimony, if believed, was that he was attacked by private individuals. But as the government argues in its brief, to establish a claim of persecution Ago must show that Albanian authorities perpetrated the attacks, condoned the attacks, or, at the very least, demonstrated a \u201ccomplete helplessness\u201d to protect him. <em>See Roman v. INS, </em>233 F.3d 1027, 1034 (7th Cir.2000); <em>Galina v. INS, </em>213 F.3d 955, 958 (7th Cir.2000); <em>Chitay-Pirir v. INS, </em>169 F.3d 1079, 1081 (7th Cir.1999); <em>Hengan v. INS, </em>79 F.3d 60, 62-63 (7th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b582-8\">There is little evidence in the record about the Albanian government\u2019s involvement, if any, in the attacks Ago described. Ago testified that he went to the police after his neighbor shot at him, but to his knowledge the neighbor was never arrested. He surmised at his hearing that the police, who were members of the Socialist Party, were protecting his neighbor, but there is nothing in the record to support this assertion beyond Ago\u2019s subjective belief. As for the beating incident, there is nothing in the record to suggest that Ago even reported the attack to the police. It was Ago\u2019s burden to establish his eligibility for asylum, <em>see </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13, and he failed to do so. <em>See Meghani v. INS, </em>236 F.3d 843, 846 (7th Cir.2001) (agency properly denied asylum where petitioner offered no evidence that government failed to protect him from attack by rival political group members).</p>\n<p id=\"b583-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>Accordingly, the petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
