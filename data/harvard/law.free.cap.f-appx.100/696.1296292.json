We need not decide whether the interrogation was conducted in violation of <em>Miranda v. Arizona, </em>384 U.S. 436, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694 (1966), or <em>Edwards v. Arizona, </em>451 U.S. 477, 101 S.Ct. 1880, 68 L.Ed.2d 378 (1981). The testimony as to the threats Suddeth made to the officer during the interrogation was admissible under <em>Miranda. United States v. Mitchell, </em>812 F.2d 1250, 1253-54 (9th Cir.1987) <em>overruled on other grounds by Planned Parenthood of the Columbia/Willamette, Inc. v. Am. Coalition of Life Activists, </em>290 F.3d 1058, 1066-70 (9th Cir.2002) (en banc). Even assuming, without deciding, that the interrogation was conducted in violation of <em>Miranda, </em>admission of the remainder of the testimony concerning the interrogation was harmless because it did not have a \u201c \u2018substantial and injurious effect or influence in determining the jury\u2019s verdict.\u2019 \u201d <em>Brecht v. Abrahamson, </em>507 U.S. 619, 637, 113 S.Ct. 1710, 123 L.Ed.2d 353 (1993) (quoting <em>Kotteakos v. United States, </em>328 U.S. 750, 776, 66 S.Ct. 1239, 90 L.Ed. 1557 (1946)).</p>\n<p id=\"b727-7\">Because there was no error in the admission of Suddeth\u2019s statements at trial, <em>a fortiori, </em>appellate counsel was not constitutionally ineffective for failing to assert the issue. <em>See Turner v. Calderon, </em>281 F.3d 851, 872 (9th Cir.2002) (stating that counsel is not ineffective for refraining from arguing an issue that has little or no prospect of success).</p>\n<p id=\"b727-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b727-8\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
