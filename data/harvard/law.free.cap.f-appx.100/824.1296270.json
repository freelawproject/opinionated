The defendant filed a motion to suppress any use at trial of \u201cany and all evidence seized pursuant to the stop of the vehicle he was driving on the 9th day of July, 2001, which forms the basis of the charges in the instant case.\u201d As grounds therefor, the defendant claimed that the stop and search of his vehicle was \u201cwithout probable cause and outside the ambit of a judicially drawn warrant,\u201d in violation of his Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments rights. After an evidentiary hearing, the district court denied the motion to suppress. On the same date the motion to suppress was denied, the defendant filed a \u201cPost-Oral Argument Memorandum,\u201d which, in the main, distinguished the cases relied on by the government at oral argument. The district court denied that motion with the comment that the matter relied on \u201cwould not alter the court\u2019s ruling\u201d to deny the motion to suppress. Thereafter, the defendant entered a conditional plea of guilty to Count 1 of the indictment, and he was later sentenced to imprisonment for 262 months. Count 2 was dismissed on motion of the United States. The defendant appeals. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-11\">The defendant was stopped by a deputy sheriff in Utah for driving 85 m.p.h. in a 70 m.p.h. zone. The arresting officer detected an odor of burnt marijuana emanating from the vehicle and the defendant and his passenger admitted smoking marijuana. The officer then asked if the defendant would consent to a search of the vehicle, which he gave. Marijuana roaches were found in the ashtray. At that point in time, the defendant was arrested. Other than the roaches, nothing of any significance was found in the interior of the vehicle. By this time, other officers arrived. The trunk lid was lifted and there was an odor of raw marijuana, according to certain of the officers. Further, the officers also noticed \u201csome screws hanging out, Bondo-type stuff, fresh type Bondo stuff had been put in that didn\u2019t match the cover, the trunk area.\u201d One of the officers looked under the car and saw a \u201chidden compartment in which he\u2019s had numerous experiences with that probably contained drugs.\u201d (Sic) The car was then taken to police headquarters, and, after a warrant was obtained, the bumper was removed and, as we understand it, raw marijuana and cocaine were discovered in a hidden compartment.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-12\">The defendant does not now contend that he was unlawfully \u201cstopped,\u201d nor does he contend that the search of the interior of his car was unlawful. Further, though there is a suggestion that the opening of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"826\">*826</page-number>the trunk lid was, itself, improper, defendant\u2019s focus on appeal is that the officers did not have \u201cprobable cause\u201d to dismantle the bumper to search for a hidden compartment. As above indicated, the so-called \u201cdismantling\u201d did not occur at the scene of the stop. One of the officers drove the vehicle to police headquarters and after a sniffing dog had alerted, a search warrant was obtained and a search ensued. As for the search warrant, the defendant contends that the affidavit in support of the warrant was insufficient to support the issuance thereof, pointing out, <em>inter alia, </em>that the sniffing dog, named Uno, was \u201cold\u201d and at the time, \u201cuncertified.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b856-4\">The district court, in denying the motion to suppress, entered a rather detailed order in which it, after making its findings of fact, concluded, as a matter of law, that the officers had \u201cprobable cause\u201d to search the entire vehicle, which included the dismantling of the bumper wherein a compartment was discovered which contained raw marijuana and cocaine. In thus holding, the district court did not feel it necessary to consider the question of whether the warrant was issued on probable cause. Specifically, the district court in this regard spoke as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b856-5\">Given that probable cause existed to search the entire vehicle once the officers smelled and discovered burnt marijuana cigarettes in the passenger compartment, and smelled the odor of raw marijuana and observed alterations in the trunk of the vehicle, the officer\u2019s further steps of having a police dog sniff the car and obtaining a search warrant were unnecessary to provide legal justification for the search.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b856-6\">In denying defendant\u2019s motion to suppress, the district court cited, <em>inter alia, United States v. Downs, </em>151 F.3d 1301, 1303 (10th Cir.1998), <em>cert. denied, </em>526 U.S. 1078, 119 S.Ct. 1483, 143 L.Ed.2d 565 (1999) (\u201cProbable cause to search a vehicle is established if, under the totality of the circumstances, there is a fair probability that the car contains contraband or evidence.\u201d); <em>United States v. Nielsen, </em>9 F.3d 1487, 1491 (10th Cir.1993) (\u201cThe scope of a warrant-less search of an automobile \u2018is defined by the object of the search and the places in which there is probable cause to believe that it may be found.\u2019 \u201d); <em>United States v. Parker, </em>72 F.3d 1444, 1450 (10th Cir.l995)(\u201cRather, an officer obtains probable cause to search the trunk of a vehicle once he smells marijuana in the passenger compartment and finds corroborating evidence of contraband.\u201d); <em>United States v. Ashby, </em>864 F.2d 690, 692 (10th Cir.1988), <em>cert. denied, </em>494 U.S. 1070, 110 S.Ct. 1793, 108 L.Ed.2d 794 (1990) (\u201cOnce probable cause exists for a search, the police have the authority to search the entire vehicle.\u201d); and <em>United States v. Vasquez-Castillo, </em>258 F.3d 1207, 1213 (10th Cir.2001)(\u201cWhen an officer encounters the smell of raw marijuana, there is the fair probability that the vehicle is being used to transport marijuana and that the marijuana has been secreted in places other than the passenger compartment.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b856-9\">In the instant case, unlike some of the cases relied on by the trial court, the defendant consented to a search of the vehicle. Be that as it may, we agree with the district court that in the instant case there was \u201cprobable cause\u201d to search the vehicle, including the trunk and the \u201cdismantling of the bumper.\u201d The evidence supports the finding that when the officers opened the trunk, they saw items that suggested there was a \u201cfair probability\u201d that additional contraband had been secreted in or close to the trunk, which would include the rear bumper. As already stated, a \u201csecret compartment\u201d was discovered with raw marijuana and considerable cocaine located therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"827\">*827</page-number>Further, we agree with the district court that having determined there was \u201cprobable cause,\u201d it became unnecessary to consider the further contention of the defendant that the search warrant was invalid because the affidavit in support thereof was insufficient. Hence, for example, we need not here consider the \u201ccredibility\u201d of Uno, the sniffing canine, who was both \u201cold\u201d and \u201cuncertified,\u201d and, we are advised, is now deceased.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-5\">In our review of a district court order denying a motion to suppress, we accept the district court\u2019s findings of fact unless clearly erroneous and, in so doing, we consider the totality of the circumstances and view the evidence in a light most favorable to the government. The question of the \u201creasonableness\u201d of the search and seizure we review <em>de novo. </em>In sum, the district court\u2019s findings in the instant case are not clearly erroneous, and, <em>de novo, </em>we agree with the district court\u2019s conclusion that the search and seizure were \u201creasonable\u201d and did not offend the Fourth Amendment. <em>United States v. Browning, </em>252 F.3d 1153, 1157 (10th Cir.2001); <em>United States v. Gama-Bastidas, </em>142 F.3d 1233, 1237 (10th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b857-6\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b855-9\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. The court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 36.3. under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
