She <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>argues that she is entitled to cancellation of removal because her children would suffer atypical hardship if she were removed from this country. She argues that she is entitled to asylum and withholding of removal because she will be subjected to persecution and torture based on her father\u2019s political activities if she is returned to Uganda.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-5\">This court does not have jurisdiction to review the IJ\u2019s discretionary determination that Mukarukndi\u2019s children would not suffer an \u201cexceptional and extremely unusual hardship\u201d if Mukarukiidi were deported to Uganda. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b(b)(l)(D); 8 U.S.C. 1252(a)(2)(B)(i); <em>Bravo v. Ashcroft, </em>341 F.3d 590, 592 (5th Cir.2003). This court likewise lacks jurisdiction to review the IJ\u2019s determination that Mukarukiidi\u2019s asylum application was untimely. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(3). Mukarukiidi\u2019s petition for review is thus DISMISSED as to her claims concerning cancellation of removal and asylum.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-6\">This court will uphold a factual finding that an alien is not eligible for withholding of removal if that finding is supported by substantial evidence. <em>Chun v. INS, </em>40 F.3d 76, 78-79 (5th Cir.1994). The substantial evidence standard requires that the decision be based on the evidence presented and that the decision be substantially reasonable. <em>Carbajal-Gonzalez v. INS, </em>78 F.3d 194, 197 (5th Cir.1996). The decision will be affirmed unless the \u201cevidence compels a contrary conclusion.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b357-8\">The BIA\u2019s decisions concerning Mukarukiidi\u2019s claims for withholding of removal are supported by substantial evidence, and the record does not compel a contrary conclusion as to either her INA claim or her CAT claim. Accordingly, Mukarukiidi\u2019s petition for review is DENIED as to her claims for withholding of removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-9\">PETITION DISMISSED IN PART AND DENIED IN PART</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b356-7\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir R. 47.5 the Court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
