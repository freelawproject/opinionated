Eugene Gibbs appeals from the district court\u2019s denial of his motions for reconsideration and for injunctive relief. Because we agree with the district court that Gibbs\u2019 motions were frivolous, we dismiss the appeal. To the extent that Gibbs seeks release from prison, he must pursue such relief in his criminal case. We deny all of Gibbs\u2019 pending motions, including his motions for habeas corpus relief, to expedite, to amend his notice of appeal, and for appointment of counsel. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b922-26\">\n<em>DISMISSED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
