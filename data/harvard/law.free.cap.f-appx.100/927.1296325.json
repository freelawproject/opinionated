We have reviewed the record and find no reversible error. Accordingly, we affirm on the reasoning of the district court. <em>See J.J. v. Board of Educ. of Montgomery Co., </em>No. CA-02-491-PJM (D. Md. Mar. 26, 2008 &amp; Feb. 10, 2003). Given this disposition, we also deny counsel\u2019s motions to withdraw from representation and for the appointment of new counsel. We grant the Appellees\u2019 motion to submit this appeal on the briefs, and we dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b958-4\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
