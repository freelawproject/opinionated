We have recently rejected identical challenges to the Board\u2019s streamlining regulations in <em>Blanco de Belbruno v. Ashcroft, </em>362 F.3d 272, 279-82 (4th Cir.2004). <em>See also Khattak v. Ashcroft, </em>332 F.3d 250, 253 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied,</em>\u2014U.S.-, 124 S.Ct. 833, 157 L.Ed.2d 699 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b226-22\">Accordingly, we find Albert\u2019s claims are meritless and deny his petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-23\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
