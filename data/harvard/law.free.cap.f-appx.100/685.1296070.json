The BIA affirmed without opinion the immigration judge\u2019s (\u201cU\u2019s\u201d) order denying Wong\u2019s applications for asylum, withholding of removal, and protection under the Convention Against Torture.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In streamlining cases, we review the IJ\u2019s order as the final agency decision. <em>Fajardo v. INS, </em>300 F.3d 1018, 1019 n. 1 (9th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b715-24\">Wong contends that she established a change in circumstances and extraordinary circumstances sufficient to excuse the late filing of her asylum application pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(2)(D). We lack jurisdiction to review the IJ\u2019s determination that Wong failed to meet an exception to the time limit set forth in \u00a7 1158(a)(2)(B). <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(3); <em>Hakeem v. INS, </em>273 F.3d 812, 815 (9th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b716-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"686\">*686</page-number>Wong also contends that the BIA failed to follow its own regulations in streamlining her appeal and thereby violated her due process rights. Because we lack jurisdiction to review the merits of the IJ\u2019s decision, we also lack jurisdiction to determine whether streamlining was appropriate in this case. <em>See Falcon Carriche v. Ashcroft, </em>350 F.3d 845, 854 (9th Cir.2003). Wong\u2019s due process challenge based on the BIA\u2019s decision to streamline her case must therefore fail. <em>See id. </em>at 852.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-4\">The petition for review is DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b715-17\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b715-25\">. Wong has abandoned her withholding of removal and Convention Against Torture claims by not raising them before the BIA or in her opening brief on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
