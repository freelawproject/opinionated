ANDERSON, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b758-14\">After examining the briefs and appellate record, this panel has determined unanimously that oral argument would not materially assist the determination of this appeal. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 34(a)(2); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-15\">Christopher E. Swan pled guilty to one count of violating the Lacey Act, 16 U.S.C. \u00a7 3372(a)(2)(A), and aiding and abetting, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2(a). He appeals the two-point upward departure he received at sentencing pursuant to United States Sentencing Commission, <em>Guidelines Manual </em>(\u201cUSSG\u201d), \u00a7 2Q2.1(b)(2)(B) (Nov. 2001) for creating \u201ca significant risk of infestation or disease transmission potentially harmful to humans\u201d in connection with his receipt of paddlefish roe from other individuals. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-16\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b758-17\">Swan made arrangements with Jim Wever for Wever to obtain paddlefish roe<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> in OMahoma and deliver it to Swan in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"729\">*729</page-number>Arkansas, for a price of $25 per pound. Swan admitted that, at the time he made these arrangements with Weaver, he knew it was illegal under Oklahoma law to take paddlef\u00edsh roe out of Oklahoma, and he further admitted that he planned to sell the roe to various buyers outside of Arkansas.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-5\">Following an extensive investigation, Wever was found guilty of poaching paddlef\u00edsh roe, in violation of Okla. Stat. tit. 29, \u00a7 6-303.1, which prohibits the possession of more than fifty pounds of unprocessed paddlef\u00edsh eggs or five pounds of processed eggs, as well as the transportation of paddlef\u00edsh eggs, processed or unprocessed, outside the state. Swan was subsequently indicted for violating, and aiding and abetting Wever in violating the Lacey Act, which makes it illegal \u201cto import, export, transport, sell, receive, acquire, or purchase in interstate ... commerce [] any fish or wildlife taken, possessed, transported, or sold in violation of any law or regulation of any State.\u201d 16 U.S.C. \u00a7 3372(a)(2)(A). Swan pled guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-6\">The probation office recommended in Swan\u2019s presentence report that he receive a two-point upward departure under USSG \u00a7 2Q2.1(b)(2)(B) because Swan\u2019s offense \u201ccreated a significant risk of infestation or disease transmission potentially harmful to humans.\u201d Swan objected, arguing that he was \u201cproperly licensed\u201d and was following applicable regulations when he processed the paddlef\u00edsh eggs. R. Vol. 2, tab 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-11\">At sentencing, the government presented testimony from Christopher J. Hurst, a United States Food and Drug Administration investigator, that paddlef\u00edsh roe is an item subject to United States Food and Drug Administration regulations concerning Hazard Analysis Critical Control Point (\u201cHACCP\u201d) plans.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> He further testified that Wever and his wife, Swan\u2019s source for paddlef\u00edsh roe, were considered processors of paddlef\u00edsh roe, and as such would also be subject to HACCP regulations and required to have an HACCP plan. Hurst then testified that the Wevers\u2019 failure to have an HACCP plan in effect for their processing of roe rendered the roe adulterated under the Food and Drug Administration Act, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 342(a)(4). <em>See </em>21 C.F.R. \u00a7 123.6(g).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Hurst also testified about the types of health hazards posed by improperly processed paddlef\u00edsh roe, including contamination by botulinum brucella and listeria monocytogenes.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-12\">A second witness, Thomas McKay, also testified at Swan\u2019s sentencing proceeding. McKay was an employee of the United States Fish and Wildlife Service in Edmond, Oklahoma, with responsibility for the northern district of Oklahoma. He testified that he was the supervising agent in the case against the Wevers and was familiar with their case. McKay testified that he considered the Wevers\u2019 roe processing methods \u201cunsanitary,\u201d that \u201cthey <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"730\">*730</page-number>had no refrigeration equipment,\u201d and that the Wevers\u2019 residence \u201cwas pretty dirty.\u201d Tr. of Sentencing Hr\u2019g at 29-30, Appellant\u2019s App. Vol. 1 at 79-80. It is undisputed that the Wevers did not have an HACCP plan. Swan did, however, have an HACCP plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-4\">After listening to the above testimony and hearing arguments from counsel for both sides, the district court found \u201cthat the United States has adduced evidence establishing by a preponderance of the evidence that in fact such a risk [of infestation or disease] was created under these circumstances, therefore, the request that the offense level be further adjusted downward is denied.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 40. Swan was sentenced to four months\u2019 imprisonment, followed by three years of supervised release, and assessed a f\u00edne of $10,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-5\">Swan argues that the district court erroneously imposed the two-point enhancement under USSG \u00a7 2Q2.1(b)(2)(B) because he should not be held accountable for the Wevers\u2019 failure to have an HACCP plan, nor was there any evidence that the roe which he had received or which he planned to obtain from the Wevers was in fact harmful to humans.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b760-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b760-7\">\u2018We review <em>de novo </em>legal questions regarding the application of the sentencing guidelines. We review the district court\u2019s factual findings for clear error, \u2018giving due deference to the district court\u2019s application of the guidelines to the facts.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Martinez, </em>342 F.3d 1203, 1205 (10th Cir.2003) (quoting <em>United States v. Brown, </em>314 <em>F.3d 1216, 1222 </em>(10th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>537 U.S. 1223, 123 S.Ct. 1338, 154 L.Ed.2d 1083 (2003)). Furthermore, \u201c[w]e review for clear error a district court\u2019s factual findings in support of a sentence enhancement.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1208; <em>see </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b760-10\">As the government points out, USSG \u00a7 lB1.3(a)(l)(B) provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AiR\">specific offense characteristics ... shall be determined on the basis of the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b760-11\">(B) in the case of a jointly undertaken criminal activity (a criminal plan, scheme, endeavor, or enterprise undertaken by the defendant in concert with others, whether or not charged as a conspiracy), all reasonably foreseeable acts and omissions of others in furtherance of the jointly undertaken criminal activity,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b760-12\">that occurred during the commission of the offense of conviction, in preparation for that offense, or in the course of attempting to avoid detection or responsibility for that offense.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b760-13\">USSG \u00a7 lB1.3(a)(l)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b760-14\">Swan was convicted of violating the Lacey Act and aiding and abetting the Wevers in violating the Lacey Act, which, in turn, required a violation of Oklahoma law. Accordingly, the district court properly considered the Wevers\u2019 conduct in processing the roe which they then transported to Swan. Furthermore, the Wevers\u2019 roe is considered adulterated under applicable federal regulations and statutes, and, as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"731\">*731</page-number>such, would present a \u201csignificant risk of infestation or disease transmission potentially harmful to humans.\u201d <em>See United States v. Blue Ribbon Smoked Fish, Inc., </em>179 F.Supp.2d 30, 44 (E.D.N.Y.2001) (\u201cBecause the defendants\u2019 HACCP plans are inadequate and do not comply with the FDA regulations, the food [defendant] processes pursuant to them is adulterated as a matter of law, as defined by .Section 342(a)(4) of the FDCA.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b761-5\">Swan argues that two other cases affirming a two-level enhancement under \u00a7 2Q2.1(b)(2) are distinguishable because they both involved a Lacey Act violation where the state law violated was itself clearly designed to protect the public health. <em>See United States v. Narte, </em>197 F.3d 959, 962 (9th Cir.1999); <em>United States v. Eyoum, </em>84 F.3d 1004, 1009 (7th Cir.1996). Thus, he argues, the violations of state laws designed to protect the public health \u201cin and of themselves were sufficient for purposes of the enhancement.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Br. at 9. He argues that, by contrast, the Oklahoma law violated in this case is merely designed to protect paddlefish, not to further any human health safety goal.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b761-6\">Swan misperceives the basis for the district court\u2019s enhancement. He was convicted of violating the Lacey Act and aiding and abetting Wever in violating that act. As part of that course of conduct, Swan obtained and agreed to obtain paddlefish roe which was considered adulterated under the Food and Drug Act. We cannot say that the district court erred in concluding that receipt of adulterated roe to be sold to others would pose a significant risk of disease transmission potentially harmful to humans. Furthermore, it is reasonable to read the Oklahoma law violated in this case, Okla. Stat. tit. 29, \u00a7 6-303.1, which regulates the possession and transportation of paddlefish eggs, as not exclusively protecting paddlefish and their eggs, but also protecting consumers of those eggs.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-10\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b761-11\">For the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM the sentence imposed in this case.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b758-9\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. The court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b758-18\"><em>. </em>Paddlefish (Polyodon Spathula) is a species of fish which inhabits lakes, rivers and streams in the Northern District of Oklahoma and surrounding areas. Paddlefish eggs are processed and sold as caviar. While it is considered an endangered species in certain states, the paddlefish population is apparently making a recovery in Oklahoma.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b759-7\">. 21 C.F.R. \u00a7 123.6 provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b759-8\">(a) <em>Hazard analysis. </em>Every processor shall conduct, or have conducted for it, a hazard analysis to determine whether there are food safety hazards that are reasonably likely to occur for each kind of fish and fishery product processed by that processor and to identify the preventive measures that the processor can apply to control those hazards ....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b759-13\">(b) <em>The HACCP plan. </em>Every processor shall have and implement a written HACCP plan whenever a hazard analysis reveals one or more food safety hazards that are reasonably likely to occur....</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b759-14\">. 21 C.F.R. \u00a7 123.6(g) states that \"[fiailure of a processor to have and implement a HACCP plan that complies with this section whenever a HACCP plan is necessary ... shall render the fish or fishery products of that processor adulterated under [21 U.S.C. \u00a7 342(a)(4)].\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b760-8\">. While the count to which Swan pled guilty involved an attempt by the Wevers to deliver some eighty-five pounds of processed paddlefish eggs and twenty-six pounds of unprocessed eggs to Swan in Arkansas, which delivery was foiled by Oklahoma game wardens acting in conjunction with the Arkansas Game and Fish Department, Swan admitted that he had purchased processed paddlefish eggs from the Wevers on prior occasions. He was not charged with those.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b761-7\">. Swan concedes that both the <em>Narte </em>and <em>Eyoum </em>courts held that the government need not prove that the particular food product involved was in fact harmful or diseased in order for the enhancement to apply.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
