R.App. P. 34(a)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b648-25\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b648-26\">Brian Bremer appeals the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment to Warden Joe Klauser and the State of Idaho, in this lawsuit filed under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-27\">Bremer\u2019s petition contended that he was entitled to relief on four grounds: (1) that he was mentally incompetent when he entered his guilty plea; (2) that his due process rights were violated when the state trial court accepted his guilty plea despite the testimony of two psychologists that he was mentally incompetent; (3) that his counsel provided ineffective assistance of counsel during proceedings related to his guilty plea; and (4) that the trial court erred in convicting and sentencing Bremer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"619\">*619</page-number>in light of the testimony of the two psychologists.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-5\">The district court determined that Bremer\u2019s first two claims were procedurally defaulted because they were never presented to the Idaho Supreme Court. Although Bremer (through counsel) filed a petition for review with the Idaho Supreme Court in his post-conviction proceedings asserting his first two claims, that court dismissed his petition as untimely under Idaho Appellate Rule 118. The district court determined Bremer\u2019s third claim to be procedurally defaulted because it was never presented to any Idaho state court. Finally, the district court considered Bremer\u2019s fourth claim to be a restatement of Bremer\u2019s first three claims and did not evaluate it separately.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-6\">When a petitioner has procedurally defaulted his claims, we will not review his claims unless the petitioner \u201ccan establish cause and prejudice or that a miscarriage of justice would result in the absence of our review.\u201d <em>Vang v. Nevada, </em>329 F.3d 1069, 1072 (9th Cir.2003) (quotation omitted). We have held that \u201c[t]o allege cause for a procedural default, a petitioner must assert that the procedural default is due to an objective factor that is external to the petitioner and that cannot fairly be attributed to him.\u201d <em>Manning v. Foster, </em>224 F.3d 1129, 1133 (9th Cir.2000) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b649-7\">We see no basis to reheve Bremer of his procedural defaults. Bremer argues that he has established cause and prejudice excusing his procedural default because of ineffective assistance of his appellate counsel, in violation of Idaho state law. Even if so, Bremer\u2019s argument is foreclosed by the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Coleman v. Thompson, </em>501 U.S. 722, 111 S.Ct. 2546, 115 L.Ed.2d 640 (1991). <em>Coleman </em>held that because a petitioner has no federal constitutional right to effective assistance of counsel in state post-conviction proceedings, any error committed by appellate counsel in such proceedings is imputed to the petitioner. 501 U.S. at 753 (\u201cAttorney ignorance or inadvertence is not \u2018cause\u2019 because the attorney is the petitioner\u2019s agent when acting, or failing to act, in furtherance of the litigation, and the petitioner must bear the risk of attorney error.\u201d) (internal quotations omitted). Because Bremer \u201ccannot claim constitutionally ineffective assistance of counsel in such [state post-conviction] proceedings,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 752, he has not shown \u201ccause\u201d that would, with prejudice, excuse his procedural default.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b649-10\">Further, there is no claim by Bremer that a \u201cmiscarriage of justice\u201d will arise if the claims are not heard by us. <em>Moran v. McDaniel, </em>80 F.3d 1261, 1271 (9th Cir.1996) (holding that petitioner must demonstrate actual innocence to meet the miscarriage of justice standard). Thus, this standard does not provide a reason to review the defaulted claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b648-28\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b649-8\">. In his opening brief, Bremer included in his statement of issues the question of \"whether the [procedural] bar at issue has been consistently applied.\u201d However, while stating that a rule must be regularly followed to be a bar, Bremer did not argue in his opening brief that the procedural rule invoked by the Idaho Supreme Court was not consistently applied at the time the court dismissed Bremer\u2019s petition. Bremer\u2019s brief fails adequately to allege that the Idaho procedural rule requiring that petitions for review in the Idaho Supreme Court be filed within 21 days of the Idaho Court of Appeals' decision was not consistently applied; this argument was not \"specifically and distinctly\u201d asserted, <em>see Arpin v. Santa Clara Valley Transp. Agency, </em>261 F.3d 912, 919 (9th Cir.2001), and therefore we do not consider it.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
