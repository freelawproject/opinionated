Barkley contends on appeal that the district court clearly erred in finding that he made statements amounting to a threat of death during one of the robberies, U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual \u00a7 2B3.1(b)(2)(F) (2002), and in sentencing him as a career offender. USSG \u00a7 4B1.1. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b930-16\">After the bank robbery on July 12, 2002, one of the bank tellers reported that the robber told her, \u201cDon\u2019t do anything funny or I will shoot you.\u201d A second teller stated that the robber warned her, \u201cDon\u2019t make me use my gun.\u201d Barkley conceded that these statements would constitute a threat of death as defined in Application Note 6 to \u00a7 2B3.1, but proffered at sentencing that he had not made the statements. The district court accepted the witnesses\u2019 statements and summarily overruled Barkley\u2019s objection to the enhancement. We find that the district court did not clearly err in this respect, <em>see United States v. Love, </em>134 F.3d 595, 606 (4th Cir.1998) (stating standard of review), and that the basis for the court\u2019s finding was implicit in its ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b930-17\">Barkley\u2019s career offender status was based on a prior conviction for bank robbery and a 1990 conviction for assault on a female. Barkley maintained that the latter misdemeanor conviction, for which he received a two-year sentence of imprisonment, was constitutionally invalid. At sentencing, Barkley testified that he was not represented when he pleaded guilty to the assault and that he did not waive counsel. He acknowledged that he did not remember all the details of the hearing, but maintained that he was sure he had not been asked whether he wanted a lawyer. The district court noted that North Carolina law has long required that any defendant who may be subject to a term of imprisonment be informed of his right to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"901\">*901</page-number>counsel, and that Barkley had at least twelve prior criminal convictions by the time he pleaded guilty to the assault charge, which led the court to believe that by 1990 he was familiar with his right to counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b931-5\">While a defendant may challenge at sentencing the validity of a prior conviction on the ground that he was denied counsel, <em>Custis v. United States, </em>511 U.S. 485, 495, 114 S.Ct. 1782, 128 L.Ed.2d 517 (1994), he bears the burden of showing that the prior conviction is invalid. <em>United States v. Jones, </em>977 F.2d 105, 109 (4th Cir.1992). Barkley had to overcome the presumption that the state court informed him of his right to counsel as it was required by statute to do. <em>Parke v. Raley, </em>506 U.S. 20, 28-34, 113 S.Ct. 517, 121 L.Ed.2d 391 (1992) (holding that presumption of regularity that attaches to final judgments makes it appropriate for defendant to have burden of showing irregularity of prior plea). He failed to meet his burden because the district court did not find Barkley\u2019s testimony sufficiently clear or credible to establish that he had not been informed of his right to counsel and had not waived counsel. Given the court\u2019s assessment of Barkley\u2019s credibility, which we will not review, <em>United States v. Hobbs, </em>136 F.3d 384, 391 n. 11 (4th Cir.1998), the court did not err in finding that Barkley had not been denied his right to counsel and that he qualified for sentencing as a career offender.</p>\n<p id=\"b931-6\">We therefore affirm the sentence imposed by the district court. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b931-7\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
