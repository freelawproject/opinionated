Allison appeals from the District Court\u2019s judgment affirming the Commissioner of Social Security\u2019s denial of his application for a period of disability and Disability Insurance Benefits under Sections 216(i) and 223 of the Social Security Act (\u201cAct\u201d). Allison\u2019s appeal essentially challenges the Administrative Law Judge\u2019s (\u201cALJ\u201d) finding at step four of the five-step evaluation process promulgated by the Social Security Administration to determine whether an individual is disabled. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1520. At step four, the ALJ concluded that Allison retained the residual functional capacity to perform \u201clight work,\u201d with noted restrictions. For the reasons stated below, we will affirm the District Court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-17\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-18\">Allison was born on January 10, 1959. He has a high school education and past relevant work experience as an automobile radiator repairman. In his brief, Allison claims that he was injured in two separate accidents. In the spring of 1997, he sustained unresolved back and neck injuries as a result of a motor vehicle accident. In mid-July of 1998, Allison suffered an umbilical hernia while lifting a radiator at work. Allison filed his first claim for disability benefits on November 12, 1999, claiming that he had \u201cscar tissue in groin area due to double hernia and surgery, high blood pressure, [and] depression\u201d and that \u201cI have constant pain in the groin.\u201d Tr. at 125. This claim was denied on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>March 13, 2000, and Allison did not seek review of that claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-4\">In July of 2000, Allison filed a second application for disability insurance benefits. In this present application, Allison claims that he had \u201cpain in groin, lower back and neck.\u201d Tr. at 148. This application was initially denied, and a request for hearing was timely filed. Allison, represented by counsel, appeared before the ALJ on March 14, 2002. On April 20, 2002, the ALJ rendered a decision concluding that Allison was not disabled under the Act. On July 23, 2002, the Appeals Council denied Allison\u2019s request to review the ALJ\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-5\">Allison sought judicial review of the adverse decision, pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g), in the United States District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania. On September 3, 2003, the Honorable David S. Cercone granted the Commissioner\u2019s motion for summary judgment and denied Allison\u2019s cross-motion for summary judgment. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-7\">The District Court exercised jurisdiction pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g), and appellate jurisdiction is vested in this Court under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. The role of this Court is identical to that of the District Court; we must determine whether there is substantial evidence to support the Commissioner\u2019s decision. <em>Plummer v. Apfel, </em>186 F.3d 422, 427 (3d Cir.1999). Substantial evidence means \u201c \u2018such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u2019 \u201d <em>Jesurum v. Sec\u2019y of the U.S. Dep\u2019t of Health &amp; Human Servs., </em>48 F.3d 114, 117 (3d Cir.1995) (quoting <em>Richardson v. Perales, </em>402 U.S. 389, 401, 91 S.Ct. 1420, 28 L.Ed.2d 842 (1971)). \u201cIt is less than a preponderance of the evidence but more than a mere scintilla.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Overall, the substantial evidence standard is a deferential standard of review. <em>Schaudeck v. Comm\u2019r of Soc. Sec. Admin., </em>181 F.3d 429, 431 (3d Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b138-9\">The Social Security Administration has promulgated a five-step evaluation process to determine whether an individual is disabled. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1520; <em>see generally Plummer, </em>186 F.3d at 428. In step one, the Commissioner decides whether the claimant is currently engaging in substantial gainful activity. If so, the claimant is not eligible for disability benefits. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 404.1520(a) <em>&amp; </em>(b). In step two, the Commissioner determines whether the claimant is suffering from a severe impairment. If the impairment is not \u201csevere,\u201d the claimant is not eligible for disability benefits. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1520(c). In step three, the Commissioner evaluates whether the evidence establishes that the claimant suffers from a listed impairment. If so, the claimant is automatically eligible for benefits. If the claimant does not suffer from a listed impairment or its equivalent, however, the Commissioner proceeds to the next step. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1520(d). In step four, the Commissioner examines the claimant\u2019s \u201cresidual functional capacity,\u201d and whether such capacity enables her to perform her past relevant work. If so, the claimant is not eligible for disability benefits. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1520(e). Finally, in step five the Commissioner considers whether work exists in significant numbers in the national economy that the claimant can perform given her medical impairments, age, education, past work experience, and residual functional capacity. If so, the claimant is not eligible for benefits. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1520(f). In this final step, \u201cthe burden of production shifts to the Commissioner, who must demonstrate the claimant is capable of performing other available work in order to deny a claim of disability.\u201d <em>Plummer, </em>186 F.3d at 428.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>The issues on appeal arise from the ALJ\u2019s determination at step four that Allison had the residual functional capacity to perform light work.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-6\">Allison argues (1) that substantial evidence does not support the ALJ\u2019s finding that he had the residual functional capacity to perform light work activity; (2) that the ALJ accorded inadequate weight to the reports of his treating physicians; and (3) that substantial evidence does not support the ALJ\u2019s finding that Allison was not fully credible.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-7\">First, we disagree with Allison\u2019s allegation that the ALJ\u2019s conclusions are not supported by substantial evidence. The ALJ considered numerous medical records in rendering his decision, including records and treatment pages from Drs. Daljit Singh, Kevin O. Garrett, Doris K. Cope, Richard B. Kasdan, and Malcolm Harris; physical therapy records demonstrating improvement in Allison\u2019s condition; and Allison\u2019s description of his daily activities. Like the District Court, we are satisfied that the ALJ\u2019s decision provides sufficient evidence to support his assessment of Allison\u2019s residual functional capacity to perform a modified range of light work.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-8\">Next, we reject Allison\u2019s second contention that the ALJ did not accord adequate weight to his treating physicians, Drs. Singh and Garrett, for substantially the same reasons as outlined by the District Court. The ALJ provided sufficient details as to why he found their opinions to be inconsistent with their own clinical and objective findings. Tr. at 29-30. While this Court has acknowledged that \u201cgreater weight should be given to the findings of a treating physician than to a physician who has examined the claimant as a consultant ... [,] a statement by a plaintiffs treating physician that [h]e is \u2018disabled\u2019 or \u2018unable to work\u2019 is not dispositive.\u201d <em>Adorno v. Shalala, </em>40 F.3d 43, 47-48 (3d Cir.1994). Rather, \u201cthe ALJ must weigh the relative worth of a treating physician\u2019s report against the reports submitted by other physicians who have examined the claimant.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 48; <em>see also Jones v. Sullivan, </em>954 F.2d 125, 129 (3d Cir.1991) (concluding ALJ correctly determined opinions of treating physicians were not controlling).</p>\n<p id=\"b139-10\">Allison\u2019s third allegation is that the ALJ erred in finding his testimony not to be credible. We similarly reject this argument in light of the substantial evidence cited by the ALJ in his review of Allison\u2019s residual functional capacity. An ALJ may reject a claim of disabling pain where \u201che [has] considered] the subjective pain and specified] his reasons for rejecting these claims and [has] supported] his conclusion with medical evidence in the record.\u201d <em>Matullo v. Bowen, </em>926 F.2d 240, 245 (3d Cir.1990). Finally, we find no credence in Allison\u2019s claim that the ALJ acted inappropriately when he asked Dr. David Barn-house, the testifying medical expert, \u201cin your judgment, is the claimant\u2019s testimony regarding his symptoms consistent with the evidence in the record?\u201d App. at 54. Allison cites to no legal authority that suggests that such questioning is inappropriate. Indeed, the ALJ\u2019s question is entirely proper under 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1529, which states that in determining whether an individual is disabled, \u201cwe consider all of your symptoms, including pain, and the extent to which your symptoms <em>can reasonably be accepted as consistent with the objective medical evidence and other evidence.\u201d </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1529(a) (2004) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b139-11\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-12\">We have considered all of the arguments advanced by the parties and conclude that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>no further discussion is necessary. Accordingly, the judgment of the District Court will be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
