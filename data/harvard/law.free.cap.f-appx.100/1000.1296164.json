INS, </em>115 F.3d 299, 302 (5th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b1031-20\">Kharshiladze has not challenged the IJ\u2019s denial of withholding of removal or the IJ\u2019s denial of relief under the Convention Against Torture. These claims are therefore abandoned. <em>See Calderon-Ontiveros v. INS, </em>809 F.2d 1050, 1052 (5th Cir.1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b1031-21\">Kharshiladze argues that the record indicates that she suffered past persecution due to her political opinion and that she established a probability of future persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution due to her political opinion. Kharshiladze has not shown that the evidence compels a reasonable fact-finder to conclude that she suffered past persecution or has a well-founded fear of future persecution because of her political opinion. <em>Girma v. INS, </em>283 F.3d 664, 669 (5th Cir.2002); <em>INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 483-84, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b1031-22\">Kharhsiladze further argues that the BIA violated her due process rights <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1002\">*1002</page-number>when it issued an affirmance without an opinion pursuant to 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1008.1(e)(4). The due process argument is without merit. <em>See Soadjede v. Ashcroft, </em>324 F.3d 830, 832-33 (5th Cir.2003) (rejecting due process challenge to a similar summary affirmance procedure set forth in 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1(a)(7)). The petition for review is therefore DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b1031-15\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
