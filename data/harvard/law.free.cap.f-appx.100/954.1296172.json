Gibbs appeals from the district court\u2019s denial of his request for a certificate of appealability on various issues presented in his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 (2000) motion to vacate his sentence. An appeal may not be taken to this court from the final order in a \u00a7 2255 proceeding unless a circuit justice or judge issues a certificate of appealability. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(1) (2000). A certificate of appeal-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"955\">*955</page-number>ability will not issue absent \u201ca substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2) (2000). A prisoner satisfies this standard by demonstrating that jurists of reason would find that his constitutional claims are debatable and that any dispositive procedural rulings by the district court are also debatable or wrong. <em>See Miller-El v. Cockrell, </em>537 U.S. 322, 336, 123 S.Ct. 1029, 154 L.Ed.2d 931 (2003); <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000); <em>Rose v. Lee, </em>252 F.3d 676, 683 (4th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b985-5\">We have reviewed the record and Gibbs\u2019s submissions and conclude that Gibbs has not made the requisite showing. We therefore deny a certificate of appealability and dismiss the appeal. We further deny Gibbs\u2019s \u201cRequest to Expand the Record.\u201d We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b985-6\">\n<em>DISMISSED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
