The district court granted summary judgment to ACE, concluding that the policy did not cover the losses. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>I.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-5\">On January 3, 2001, Jing Li went to Harrah\u2019s Rio Suite Hotel &amp; Casino in Las Vegas. Nevada for what would have been a night of high-stakes gambling had Li been using his own money. Li presented the casino with an instrument purporting to be a cashier\u2019s check for $500,000 from Bank of America, naming Li as the payee. Li endorsed the check, and Harrah\u2019s extended $500,000 in gambling credit, which Li lost in a matter of hours. Soon thereafter, Li gave the casino another cashier\u2019s check from Bank of America that also identified him as the payee, this time in the amount of $1 million. Harrah\u2019s again accepted the check for gambling credit, and the predictable occurred. Before Harrah\u2019s could discover the fraud, Li had lost $1,461,800 and the casino had paid him the $38,200 balance in cash, bringing Harrah\u2019s total loss to $1.5 million.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-6\">At the time of this incident. Harrah\u2019s maintained a \u201cBlanket Crime Policy\u201d with ACE. Harrah\u2019s filed a claim with ACE under the policy but the insurance company denied it, explaining that the policy did not cover this type of loss.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-7\">In response, Harrah\u2019s filed a state-law, breach-of-contract claim against ACE in federal district court, seeking to recover its $1.5 million loss. Because Harrah\u2019s is a Delaware corporation headquartered in Tennessee and ACE is a Pennsylvania corporation headquartered in Philadelphia, the district court had subject-matter jurisdiction over the action. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b419-8\">No factual disputes arose, and the parties moved for summary judgment, each focusing on whether Insuring Agreements II and IV of the policy provided coverage. Described as \u201cLoss Inside the Premises Coverage,\u201d Insuring Agreement II (as amended by Addendum 14) covers the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b419-9\">Loss of Money and Securities by the actual destruction, disappearance, wrongful abstraction [or] Funds Transfer Fraud thereof within or from the Premises, Banking Premises or similar recognized places of safe deposit.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b419-10\">JA 210. The policy defines \u201cMoney\u201d as \u201ccurrency, coins, bank notes and bullion; and travelers checks, register checks and money orders held for sale to the public.\u201d JA 197. \u201cSecurities\u201d are \u201call negotiable and non-negotiable instruments or contracts representing either Money or other property and include[ ] revenue and other stamps in current use, tokens and tickets, but do[ ] not include Money.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b419-11\">Section 2(e) of the Exclusions portion of the policy applies to Insuring Agreement II and precludes coverage for any:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b419-12\">loss (1) due to the giving or surrendering of Money or Securities in any exchange or purchase; (2) due to accounting or arithmetical errors or omissions; or (3) of manuscripts, books of account or records.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b419-13\">JA 196.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-14\">Insuring Agreement IV (as amended by Addendum 6) is entitled \u201cMoney Orders and Counterfeit Paper Currency Coverage\u201d and provides coverage for:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b419-15\">Loss due to the acceptance in good faith, in exchange for merchandise, Money, House Chips and Tokens or Services, of any post office or express money order, issued or purporting to have been issued by any post office or express company, if such money order is not paid upon presentation, or due to the acceptance in good faith in the regular course of business of counterfeit United States or Canadian paper currency.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b419-16\">JA 205. Harrah\u2019s drafted the insurance policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>In support of its summary-judgment motion, Harrah\u2019s filed virtually-identieal affidavits from two insurance experts. The affidavits relied on legal dictionaries and a publication from the International Risk Management Institute that purported to analyze this type of insurance policy. After defining several contractual terms and analyzing the policy provisions, the experts opined that the parties intended to cover Harrah\u2019s loss. The court refused to consider either affidavit because both of them offered legal conclusions, and nothing more. Order Granting Mot. to Strike at 4; <em>see </em>Fed.R.Evid. 702.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-4\">In ruling on the summary judgment motions, the district court concluded that the term \u201cwrongful abstraction\u201d covered Li\u2019s fraud under Insuring Agreement II but that Section 2(e) excluded coverage. Because Li\u2019s act involved \u201cthe giving or surrendering of Money or Securities in any exchange or purchase,\u201d the court determined that Section 2(e) applied. Turning to Insuring Agreement IV, the court described the instruments as \u201cteller\u2019s checks\u201d and concluded that they fairly could be characterized as \u201cmoney orders\u201d under the policy. D. Ct. Op. at 8. Still, because the money orders had not been issued by an \u201cexpress company,\u201d it concluded that Insuring Agreement IV did not provide coverage. <em>Id. </em>at 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-6\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-7\">The parties agree that Tennessee law governs this dispute. <em>See Hayes v. Equitable Energy Res. Co., </em>266 F.3d 560, 566 (6th Cir.2001). We give de novo review to the district court\u2019s summary judgment decision and its interpretation of the insurance policy. <em>Duane Mgmt. Co. v. Prudential Ins. Co., </em>29 F.3d 245, 248 (6th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b420-8\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-9\">We agree with the district court that Insuring Agreement II does not cover this loss. Regardless of whether Li committed a \u201cwrongful abstraction\u201d under Insuring Agreement II, Section 2(e) of the policy excludes coverage. Under Section 2(e), coverage does not extend to the \u201cgiving or surrendering of Money or Securities in any exchange or purchase.\u201d JA 196. In this instance, Harrah\u2019s gave or surrendered gambling credit \u2014 which constitutes \u201cMoney or Securities\u201d under the policy, JA 197 \u2014 in exchange for Li\u2019s forged checks.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-10\">Harrah\u2019s, notably, does not challenge the premise of this conclusion \u2014 that Li\u2019s transaction was a \u201cgiving or surrendering ... in exchange\u201d and that the gambling credit amounted to \u201cMoney or Securities.\u201d Instead, the company points to an outside source \u2014 the International Risk Management Institute \u2014 to try to show that the parties meant something else when they signed the policy. According to a publication issued by the International Risk Management Institute, Section 2(e) is a \u201crather loosely worded exclusion\u201d that generally applies to \u201closs of money caused by a salesperson\u2019s undercharging on a purchase, an error in making change, or the giving of an unwarranted refund.\u201d Int\u2019l Risk Mgmt Inst., Inc., <em>Commercial Property Crime </em>XII.D.27 (1998). In choosing an exclusion that the industry considers applicable to salesperson error, Harrah\u2019s argues, the parties could not have intended the exclusion to eliminate coverage for check fraud. If the parties intended to exclude check fraud, Harrah\u2019s adds, they would have selected the alternative \u201cvoluntary parting of title to or possession of property\u201d exclusion that the International Risk Management Institute found to exclude losses \u201cwhen the insured has willingly entered into a business transaction that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>turns out to be fraudulent.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at XII. D.28.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-5\">This argument, however, fails to come to grips with two points. It does not account for the \u201cnatural[ ] and ordinary meaning\u201d of Section 2(e), <em>Drexel Chem. Co. v. Bituminous Ins. Co., </em>933 S.W.2d 471, 477 (Tenn.Ct.App.1996), which excludes coverage for any \u201cgiving or surrendering of Money or Securities in any exchange or purchase\u201d and which is what occurred here. And the argument at best suggests an ambiguity in this admittedly \u201cloosely worded exclusion,\u201d Int\u2019l Risk Mgmt Inst., Inc., <em>Commercial Property Crime </em>XII. D.27, an ambiguity that we must construe against the drafter of the policy, Harrah\u2019s, under Tennessee law, <em>see Realty Shop, Inc. v. RR Westminster Holding, Inc., </em>7 S.W.3d 581, 598 (Tenn.Ct.App.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b421-6\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-7\">We also agree with the district court that Insuring Agreement IV does not provide coverage, though we take a slightly different path in reaching that conclusion. In our view, the instruments at issue were not \u201cexpress money orders\u201d issued by an \u201cexpress company.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b421-8\">As a preliminary matter, Harrah\u2019s argues that we may not consider this argument because ACE did not file a separate notice of appeal challenging the district court\u2019s contrary conclusion on this point. Because ACE\u2019s legal argument presents an alternative ground for affirmance, however, the company was free to raise this argument on appeal without filing a cross-appeal. <em>See Moore v. Freeman, </em>355 F.3d 558, 565 (6th Cir.2004) (\u201c[T]he appellee may, without taking a cross-appeal, urge in support of a decree any matter appearing in the record.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b421-9\">Insuring Agreement IV provides coverage for \u201c[1] post office or [2] express money orders,\u201d not money orders in general. The cashier\u2019s checks at issue in this case assuredly are not postal money orders. Aside from being issued by a post office rather than by a bank, postal money orders differ from cashier\u2019s checks in that a \u201c[postal] money order with more than one endorsement is invalid.\u201d Domestic Mail Manual S020 \u00a7 2.7 (Jan.2004): <em>see also </em>39 C.F.R. \u00a7 111.1 (incorporating the Domestic Mail Manual into the Code of Federal Regulations by reference); 5A Lary Lawrence. <em>Anderson on the Uniform Commercial Code </em>\u00a7 3-104:61 (2003) (a postal money order \u201cis not a negotiable instrument transferable to a bona fide holder for value free of defenses,\u201d and \u201c[i]t lacks the essential characteristics of a negotiable instrument and there are numerous restrictions and limitations in the postal laws and regulations which are inconsistent with a concept of negotiability\u201d). Cashier\u2019s checks on the other hand are freely negotiable and maintain the essential characteristics of a check. <em>See </em>Tenn.Code Ann. \u00a7 47-3-104(g) (U.C.C. \u00a7 3-104(g)) (\u201c \u2018Cashier\u2019s check\u2019 means a draft with respect to which the drawer and drawee are the same bank or branches of the same bank.\u201d); <em>see also Spencer v. Sterling Bank, </em>63 Cal.App.4th 1055, 74 Cal.Rptr.2d 576, 578 (1998) (\u201cChecks, including cashiers\u2019 checks, are \u2018negotiable instruments\u2019 covered by\u201d Article 3 of the Uniform Commercial Code.). The Postmaster General also retains the right to refuse payment of postal money orders. Domestic Mail Manual S020 \u00a7 3.2. A bank, by contrast, may not refuse payment of its own cashier\u2019s checks; in signing the check as a drawer, the bank becomes liable to the holder for payment. <em>See </em>Tenn.Code Ann. \u00a7 47-3-412 (U.C.C. \u00a7 3-412); <em>id. \u00a7 </em>47-3-411(b) (U.C.C. \u00a7 3-411(b)); Glenn G. Munn et al., <em>Encyclopedia of Banking and Finance </em>168 (9th ed.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b422-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>The more taxing question is whether these instruments constitute \u201cexpress money orders.\u201d The phrase \u201cexpress money orders\u201d is not a term of art that lends itself to a readily-agreed-upon definition. The Uniform Commercial Code, for example, does not define the phrase. And Munn\u2019s <em>Encyclopedia of Banking and Finance </em>does not independently define an \u201cexpress company money order,\u201d Munn et al., <em>supra, </em>at 315, but merely refers the reader to the general definition of \u201cmoney order,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 673, and at other times contrasts the phrase with other instruments, <em>id. </em>at 96, <em>see infra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b422-4\">Although some definitions of \u201cmoney order\u201d encompass cashier\u2019s checks, <em>see Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>1022 (7th ed.1999), any attempt to classify these cashier\u2019s checks in this way at best leads one to the conclusion that this is a \u201cbank money order,\u201d not an \u201cexpress money order.\u201d Indeed, while Munn\u2019s Encyclopedia of Banking and Finance does not separately define \u201cexpress money order,\u201d it does define \u201cbank money order\u201d as \u201cpractically a modified form of a cashier\u2019s check\u201d that is \u201cissued and sold by banks, <em>as distinguished from, postal and express money orders,\u201d </em>and <em>\u201cunlike </em>[a] postal money order[] may be endorsed any number of times.\u201d Munn et al., <em>supra, </em>at 96 (emphasis added); <em>see also </em>Henry J. Bailey &amp; Richard B. Hagedorn, <em>Brady on Bank Checks </em>\u00b6 1.20 (2003) (same); Barkley Clark &amp; Barbara Clark, <em>The Law of Bank Deposits, Collections and Credit Cards </em>\u00b6 3.06[3][D] (2003) (\u201cBank money orders are obligations executed by the bank itself. ... They should be treated like cashier\u2019s checks.\u201d). Thus, even if a cashier\u2019s check may be treated as a \u201cmoney order,\u201d it does not follow that these cashier\u2019s checks amount to express money orders under the insurance policy. <em>See Computer Works, Inc. v. CNA Ins. Cos., </em>757 P.2d 167, 169 (Colo.Ct.App.1988) (finding \u201cno ambiguity in the term \u2018post office or express money order\u2019 \u201d used in an insurance policy and holding that \u201ca cashier\u2019s check issued by a private banking institution does not fall into either classification\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b422-6\">Aside from its belief that we do not have jurisdiction to consider the issue, Harrah\u2019s offers no argument to counter this interpretation. Because the phrase \u201cpostal or express money order\u201d does not naturally encompass a cashier\u2019s check issued by a bank and because at a minimum ambiguity clouds the meaning of the phrase, <em>see Realty Shop, Inc., </em>7 S.W.3d at 598, Insuring Agreement IV fails to cover Harrah\u2019s loss.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-7\">A related limitation in Insuring Agreement IV prompts a similar conclusion. Not only did Harrah\u2019s have to show that these cashier\u2019s checks were \u201cexpress money orders\u201d in order to obtain coverage, but it also had to show that they were issued by an \u201cexpress company.\u201d That phrase is at best inscrutable and at worst undermines Harrah\u2019s position. While the most recent Black\u2019s Law Dictionary does not define the phrase, earlier editions define \u201cexpress company\u201d as \u201ca firm or corporation engaged in the business of <em>transporting parcels or other moveable property, </em>in the capacity of <em>common carriers, </em>and especially undertaking the safe carriage and speedy delivery of small but valuable <em>packages </em>of goods and money.\u201d <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>691 (4th ed.1968) (emphasis added); <em>see also Crane v. Ry. Express Agency, Inc., </em>369 111. 110, 15 N.E.2d 866, 871 (1938) (\u201cThe business of an express company, as usually conducted, involves continuous custody of goods received as a bailee from the time of their receipt until their final delivery.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b422-8\">As a national banking institution, Bank of America does not naturally fit within these definitions. Although Bank of America offers its customers a variety of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>mechanisms for making payments, obtaining cash or obtaining credit, it does not <em>physically </em>transport goods or money. Debit and credit cards, electronic funds transfers, travelers\u2019 checks and other negotiable instruments all contemplate methods of payment, not methods of physically transporting money. <em>See, e.g., Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>409 (7th ed. 1999) (\u201cA [debit] card [is] used to pay for purchases by electronic transfer from the purchaser\u2019s bank account.\u201d); <em>id. </em>at 375 (\u201cA [credit] card [is] used to obtain items on credit.\u201d); Tenn.Code Ann. \u00a7 47-4A-101 cmt. (U.C.C. \u00a7 4A-101) (\u201cIn [drafting Article 4A on Funds Transfers] a deliberate decision was made ... to treat funds transfer as a unique method of payment.\u201d). Indeed, the whole point of these services, it would seem, is to make \u201cexpress companies\u201d irrelevant \u2014 or at least irrelevant when it comes to transporting money.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-5\">In arguing to the contrary, Harrah\u2019s relies on <em>Harrah\u2019s Entm\u2019t, Inc. v. ACE Am. Ins. Co., </em>No. 01-2032 M1/ADA (W.D.Tenn. Oct. 30, 2001) <em>(Harrah\u2019s I), </em>which determined that when a company issues money orders, travelers\u2019 checks and credit cards, it offers customers a means of transporting money in a convenient form, <em>id. </em>at 8-9. <em>Harrah\u2019s I, </em>however, offered no support for this conclusion and failed to explain how banks and express companies in fact provide the same service. While express companies provide \u201csafe carriage and speedy delivery of ... money,\u201d banks supplant this physical-delivery service by providing modern methods of payment and credit. Other authorities, it bears adding, use the phrase \u201cexpress company\u201d in the limited sense of those organizations engaged in the physical transportation of property and money. <em>See White v. United Parcel Svc., Inc., </em>495 So.2d 675, 676 (Ala. Civ.App.1985) (defining an express company as \u201c \u2018a common carrier that carries at regular and stated times, over fixed and regular routes, money and other valuable packages, which cannot be conveniently or safely carried as common freight\u2019 \u201d) (quoting <em>Pac. Express Co. v. Seibert, </em>44 F. 310, 318 (C.C.W.D.Mo.1890)); Ind.Code \u00a7 8-2.1-21-1 (enacted in 1989) (defining an \u201cexpress company,\u201d for purposes of regulating motor carriers, as a company \u201cin the business of carrying or transporting gold or silver coin or paper currency, over or upon any of the railroads, rivers, canals or other thoroughfares in Indiana\u201d); Cal. Pub. Util.Code \u00a7 219 (\u201c\u2018Express corporation\u2019 includes every corporation or person engaged in or transacting the business of transporting any freight, merchandise, or other property for compensation on the line of any common carrier or stage or auto stage line \"within this State.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b423-7\">While the weight of authority in our view suggests that express companies physically transport money and other valuable property, it is at least a matter of some ambiguity to say that they perform the same services as banks. As the drafter of the policy, Harrah\u2019s bears responsibility for that confusion, a responsibility that has particular significance here. There is a material difference between the risk of insuring money orders issued by the United States Postal Service and traditional express companies on the one hand and the risk of insuring money orders issued by all banks on the other. As one court concluded in interpreting a similar policy, \u201c[t]he difference in the number of institutions whose instruments would be implicated, as well as the differing internal business practices of each, might well influence the degree of risk that an insurer would be assuming.\u201d <em>Computer Works, Inc., </em>757 P.2d at 168-69. Before expecting an insurance company to take on that additional risk, the insured ought to take care that the policy by its terms covers such instruments, and that is particularly true <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>when the insured (Harrah\u2019s) is the drafter of the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-5\">We need not take long in addressing Harrah\u2019s final argument \u2014 that the district court committed reversible error in striking the two affidavits of its insurance experts. First, contrary to ACE\u2019s contention, we have jurisdiction to review this ruling, as the appeal of a district court\u2019s final judgment \u201cdraws into question all prior non-final rulings and orders,\u201d <em>McLaurin v. Fischer, </em>768 F.2d 98, 101 (6th Cir.1985), including this interlocutory ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-6\">Second, we review a district court\u2019s ruling on a motion to strike for an abuse of discretion. <em>See Adusumilli v. City of Chicago, </em>164 F.3d 353, 359 (7th Cir.1998); <em>see also Mohney v. USA Hockey, Inc., </em>5 Fed.Appx. 450 (6th Cir.2001). Under Rule 56(e) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, \u201caffidavits shall be made on personal knowledge [and] shall set forth such facts as would be admissible in evidence.\u201d Fed. R.Civ.P. 56(e). \u201cIt is well settled that courts should disregard conclusions of law (or \u2018ultimate fact\u2019) found in affidavits\u201d submitted for summary judgment. <em>F.R.C. Inti, Inc. v. United States, </em>278 F.3d 641, 643 (6th Cir.2002). In this instance, there were no disputed questions of fact, and the \u201cultimate issue\u201d before the court (in Harrah\u2019s words) was \u201cwhether or not the parties intended to insure the Loss caused by Mr. Li.\u201d Appellant Br. at 27. The affidavits offered in support of Harrah\u2019s interpretation did nothing more than reach a series of legal conclusions about this one issue. For example, both experts stated: \u201cIn my opinion, the [policy] was intended to provide coverage in the present situation.\u201d JA 51, 64; \u201cInsuring Agreement II provides coverage for the loss sustained by Harrah\u2019s,\u201d JA 52, 65; \u201c[i]t is also my opinion that Harrah\u2019s loss is covered under ... Insuring Agreement IV,\u201d JA 53, 66; they defined the terms \u201cwrongful abstraction,\u201d \u201cmoney order,\u201d and \u201cexpress company,\u201d JA 52-53, 65-66; they opined that Li\u2019s actions were a \u201cwrongful abstraction\u201d under Insuring Agreement II, that the cashier\u2019s checks were \u201cmoney orders\u201d and that Bank of America was an \u201cexpress company\u201d under Insuring Agreement IV, JA 53-54, 65-67. As the two affidavits amounted to nothing more than legal conclusions, the district court did not abuse its discretion in striking them.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-8\">rv.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-9\">For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the district court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
