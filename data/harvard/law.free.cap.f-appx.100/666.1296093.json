Because the BIA affirmed the IJ\u2019s decision without opinion, we review the IJ\u2019s decision as the final agency determination. <em>See Falcon Carriche v. Ashcroft, </em>350 F.3d 845, 849 (9th Cir.2003). Duarte\u2019s deportation proceedings began with the issuance of an Order to Show Cause on February 19, 1997, and the BIA\u2019s deportation order issued on October 25, 2002; thus, the transitional rules of the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act (\u201cIIRIRA\u201d), 110 Stat. 3610, apply. <em>See Alfaro-Reyes v. INS, </em>224 F.3d 916, 920 (9th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b697-9\">Our review is limited to the \u201c \u2018jurisdictional fact\u2019 question\u201d of whether Duarte is deportable for having committed a criminal offense covered by 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(2) (formerly \u00a7 1251(a)(2)). <em>See Luu-Le v. INS, </em>224 F.3d 911, 914 (9th Cir.2000). Duarte pleaded guilty in 1988 to the unlawful possession of heroin for sale and the purchase of heroin for purposes of sale in violation of Cal. Health <em>&amp; </em>Safety Code \u00a7 11351. His plea renders him deportable as an \u201caggravated felon\u201d under \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii) (formerly \u00a7 1251(a)(2)(A)(iii)) and as a \u201ccontrolled substance\u201d violator under \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(B)(i) (formerly \u00a7 1251(a)(2)(B)). We therefore lack jurisdiction to review the BIA\u2019s final order of deportation. <em>See </em>IIRIRA \u00a7 309(c)(4)(G); <em>Magana-Pizano v. INS, </em>200 F.3d 603, 607 (9th Cir.1999); <em>see also Aragon-Ayon v. INS, </em>206 F.3d 847, 853 (9th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b697-14\">The petition for review is DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b697-10\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
