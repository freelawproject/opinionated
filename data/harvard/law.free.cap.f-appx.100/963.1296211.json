Avilla argues that the district court erred in increasing his offense level by 16 points based on his prior aggravated assault conviction pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A). Avilla did not object to this enhancement in the district court and, therefore, review is limited to plain error. <em>See United States v. Rodriguez, </em>15 F.3d 408, 414-15 (5th Cir. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"964\">*964</page-number>1994). Because Avilla had a prior conviction for aggravated assault which falls within the definition of a crime of violence under the application notes to \u00a7 2L1.2, the 16-level enhancement of Avilla\u2019s sentence under \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A) was not error, plain or otherwise. <em>See </em>\u00a7 2L1.2, comment. (n.l(B)(ii)); <em>United States v. Ramirez, </em>367 F.3d 274, 278 (5th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b994-4\">For the first time on appeal, Avilla argues that the \u201cfelony\u201d and \u201caggravated felony\u201d provisions of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(1) and (2) are unconstitutional in view of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). He concedes that this argument is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998), but states that he is raising it to preserve it for further review. <em>Apprendi </em>did not overrule <em>Almendarez-Torres. United States v. Hernandez-Avalos, </em>251 F.3d 505, 507 <em>&amp; </em>n. 1 (5th Cir.2001). We must follow <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>until the Supreme Court overrules it. <em>Hernandez-Avalos, </em>251 F.3d at 507 n. 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b994-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b993-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
