GARZA, Circuit Judge.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></author>\n<p id=\"b279-14\">In this appeal, we review Defendant\u2014 Appellant, Jimmy Todd\u2019s, sentence pursuant to his conviction for possession of child pornography on government property. For the following reasons, we uphold the sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-18\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-19\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b279-20\">Todd worked for the United States Department of Agriculture (hereinafter, \u201cUSDA\u201d) in Fort Worth, Texas from January of 1997 until August of 2001. In 2000, Todd was issued a computer by the USDA. From at least April 20, 2001 until May 4, 2001, Todd downloaded images of child pornography from the internet onto his computer. Todd placed these images on CD\u2019s that he took to his residence. He also posted these images for transfer to other users through an internet sharing program known as Limewire.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-21\">On October 11, 2001, special agents from the USDA, along with agents from the FBI, executed a search warrant of Todd\u2019s residence, during which they found the previously mentioned CD\u2019s containing images of child pornography. The agents were also able to retrieve several images of child pornography from Todd\u2019s computer.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-22\">Todd was charged with three counts involving the receipt and possession of child pornography on government property, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2252(a)(4)(A) and (b)(2). Todd pleaded guilty and stipulated to the above facts, but he objected to the Presentence Report (hereinafter, \u201cPSR\u201d). Todd argued that his conduct did not amount to trafficking in child pornography, and thus, did not merit the application of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2G2.2. Todd argued that his conduct amounted to mere possession and should be covered by U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2G2.4, which would lower his offense level by two points.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>The government explained that the program Todd used to download the images of child pornography automatically placed those images in a folder accessible to other users. In fact, the FBI was notified of the images by a student at Stanford University that saw the file names of the images (such as \u201ceight-year-old having sex.mpg\u201d) and discovered Todd\u2019s identity by tracking his host internet protocol. The government also pointed out that the Limewire program\u2019s specific purpose is to share files, and the user is warned twice during the installation of the program that any file he downloads will be shared by default. FBI agents also testified that Todd was a sophisticated computer user based upon the evidence that he had installed software to \u201cwipe\u201d his computer and software to detect if someone was monitoring his computer.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-4\">The district court overruled Todd\u2019s objections to the PSR and applied U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2G2.2. The court also assessed two points to Todd\u2019s offense level pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2G2.2(b)(2)(E) after finding that Todd had distributed the pornographic material when he posted the material for transfer. The court sentenced Todd to 57 months\u2019 imprisonment, three years\u2019 supervised release, and a $100 mandatory special assessment. Todd timely appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-6\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b280-7\">We review the district court\u2019s interpretation and application of the Sentencing Guidelines de novo. <em>United States v. Charles, </em>301 F.3d 309, 312 (5th Cir.2002). We review the district court\u2019s factual findings for clear error. <em>United States v. Paul, </em>274 F.3d 155, 161 (5th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b280-8\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-9\">U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2G2.2</p>\n<p id=\"b280-10\">Todd first argues that the district court erred in applying U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2G2.2 instead of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2G2.4 because he merely possessed the images of child pornography. Section 2G2.4 applies to offenses for possession, but section 2G2.4(e)(2) states that the court should apply section 2G2.2 if the offense involved \u201ctrafficking in material involving sexual exploitation of a minor (including receiving, transporting, shipping, advertising, or possessing material involving the sexual exploitation of a minor with the intent to traffic) ...\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2G2.4(c)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b280-12\">While the sentencing guidelines do not define trafficking, the definition traditionally encompasses both buying and selling commodities for money and exchanging commodities by barter. <em>Id. </em>at 163. The Limewire program was designed to share or barter files. Todd was free to download files offered by other users. In return, other users were free to download Todd\u2019s files. Todd was warned that his files would be shared at least twice when he downloaded and used the Limewire program. The images on Todd\u2019s computer were actually offered to others because the FBI was notified of the existence of these images by another Limewire user who could have accessed those files.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-13\">By downloading the images and making them accessible to others, Todd\u2019s conduct met the definition of \u201ctrafficking\u201d in section 2G2.2. <em>See Id. </em>Further, the act of receiving child pornography is alone sufficient to trigger the application of section 2G2.2. <em>United States v. Canada, </em>110 F.3d 260, 264 (5th Cir.1997). The district court did not err in applying this section of the sentencing guidelines to Todd\u2019s offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-14\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-15\">DOUBLE COUNTING</p>\n<p id=\"b280-16\">Todd argues for the first time on appeal that the district court erred by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>increasing his offense level by two points based upon U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2G2.2(b)(2)(E) after finding that Todd distributed pornography. Todd argues that this increase is impermissible double counting because it punishes the same conduct as was used to apply section 2G2.2 for trafficking. Todd concedes, however, that double counting is not prohibited unless it is specifically prohibited by the guideline in question. <em>United States v. Jones, </em>145 F.3d 736, 736-37 (5th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b281-5\">Neither section 2G2.2(b)(2)(E), nor section 2G2.4(c)(2) prohibits double counting. <em>Id. </em>at 737. Section 2G2.2(b)(2)(E) requires the district court to impose a two-level increase if the offense involved distribution, which the guideline defines as \u201cany act, including production, transportation, and possession with intent to distribute, related to the transfer of material involving the sexual exploitation of a minor.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2G2.2, comment. (n.l). As previously discussed, Todd distributed the images of child pornography by making them available to other Limewire users. Thus, the district court did not err in applying the increase.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-6\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-7\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b281-8\">For the foregoing reasons, we uphold the conviction and sentence.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b279-15\">. Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the Court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
