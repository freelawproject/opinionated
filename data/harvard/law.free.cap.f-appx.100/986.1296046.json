Affording liberal construction to his brief, Chalmers contends that the inclusion of his sexual assault conviction in a Texas Department of Public Saftey\u2019s (TDPS) criminal history report violated Texas\u2019s sex offender registration provisions since the information was used in a non-regulatory, punitive manner. He further asserts that disclosure of this information was inconsistent with the district court\u2019s prior findings in cause no. 3:01-CV-528-H, which acknowledged that Chalmers\u2019s sexual assault indictment had been dismissed. In his second assignment of error, Chalmers seeks to renew his challenge to the sex offender registration requirement, arguing that he should be permitted to petition for an order of exemption. Chalmers contends that he is entitled to a hearing on this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b1016-23\">Chalmers fails to demonstrate that the disclosure of information concerning his sexual assault conviction under Texas\u2019s sex offender registration provisions constituted a constitutional violation. The report generated by TDPS merely recited all criminal charges brought against Chalmers and tracked the salient docket entries relating those charges, including the fact that Chalmers\u2019s sexual assault conviction was ultimately set aside. Because the criminal history report reflected this development, it did not conflict with the district court\u2019s findings in cause no. 3:01-CV-528-H. Furthermore, Chalmers\u2019s claim that he was harmed by TDPS\u2019s disclosure of the sexual assault conviction is conclusional and does \u201cnot suffice to prevent a motion to dismiss.\u201d <em>Fernandez-Montes v. Allied Pilots Ass\u2019n, </em>987 F.2d 278, 284 (5th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b1017-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"987\">*987</page-number>Chalmers abandoned his challenge to the ongoing sex offender registration requirement in the district court. In any event, Chalmers did not appeal from the district court\u2019s resolution of this issue in cause no. 3:01-CV-0528-H, and his attempt to resurrect the same challenge in the instant appeal is therefore rejected.</p>\n<p id=\"b1017-5\">Because the district court did not err in finding that Chalmers failed to state a claim with respect to his civil rights suit against TDPS, we AFFIRM. <em>See Leffall v. Dallas Indep. Sch. Dist., </em>28 F.3d 521, 525 (5th Cir.1994); <em>Jackson v. City of Beaumont Police Dep\u2019t, </em>958 F.2d 616, 618 (5th Cir.1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b1017-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b1016-21\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
