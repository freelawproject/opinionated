Darrick Martinez (\u201cMartinez\u201d) failed to establish that the state appellate court\u2019s decision to permit amendment of the indictment was contrary to or an unreasonable application of clearly established United States Supreme Court precedent. <em>See Clark v. Murphy, </em>331 F.3d 1062, 1067 (9th Cir.2003). Martinez\u2019s reliance on <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), and <em>Jones v. Smith, </em>231 F.3d 1227 (9th Cir.2000), is misplaced. <em>Apprendi </em>did not directly address the issue of notice to the defendant of the criminal charges and is therefore not controlling. <em>See Clark, </em>331 F.3d at 1069. The dicta in <em>Jones </em>is similarly of no assistance to Martinez, since clearly established law for purposes of habeas review is that propounded by the United States Supreme Court. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b733-21\">2. The denial of Martinez\u2019s motion for a mistrial based on a witness\u2019s emotional outburst was not constitutional error. A jury\u2019s exposure to facts not in evidence is subject to <em>Brecht </em>harmless error analysis. <em>Lawson v. Borg, </em>60 F.3d 608, 612 (9th Cir.1995). Since several witnesses identified Martinez as the assailant, Martinez failed to demonstrate that the witness\u2019s statement \u201chad substantial and injurious effect or influence in determining <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"704\">*704</page-number>the jury\u2019s verdict.\u201d <em>Brecht v. Abrahamson, </em>507 U.S. 619, 631, 113 S.Ct. 1710, 123 L.Ed.2d 353 (1993) (citation omitted). The jury was also \u201ccarefully admonished ... to ignore [the] statement and there is a strong presumption that the court\u2019s curative instruction was followed by the jury.\u201d <em>Mancuso v. Olivarez, </em>292 F.3d 939, 952 (9th Cir.2002) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b734-4\">3. Martinez also failed to establish that he was prejudiced by his wearing of a stun belt. Since the trial court took steps to ensure that the stun belt was not visible to the jury, no error resulted. <em>See Rich v. Calderon, </em>187 F.3d 1064, 1069 (9th Cir. 1999). Use of the stun belt therefore did not have a \u201csubstantial and injurious effect or influence in determining the jury\u2019s verdict.\u201d <em>Williams v. Woodford, </em>306 F.3d 665, 689 (9th Cir.2002) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b734-5\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b733-22\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
