Wheeler appeals the district court\u2019s dismissal of his 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 complaint, which alleged that Ralph Townsend and other Idaho Department of Corrections officials (hereinafter \u201cTownsend\u201d) failed to provide him with adequate medical care and violated the Americans with Disabilities Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12101 <em>et seq., </em>as well as section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 794. The district court <em>sua sponte </em>dismissed Wheeler\u2019s complaint, without prejudice, under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1997e(a) of the Prisoner Litigation Reform Act (\u201cPLRA\u201d) for failure to adequately plead exhaustion of all available administrative remedies. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we find that the district court erred in <em>sua sponte </em>dismissing Wheeler\u2019s complaint for nonexhaustion.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-6\">Wheeler is a fifty-one year-old disabled man who suffers from back and leg pain, as well as other chronic health conditions including heart trouble and asthma. On December 12, 2000, Wheeler entered the Idaho State Correctional Institution (\u201cISCI\u201d) in Boise, Idaho. Wheeler alleges in his complaint that, during the intake process, ISCI guards locked him to a bench and confiscated his personal belongings, including a cane. Despite his repeated requests, prison officials allegedly did not provide Wheeler with a substitute cane for five weeks and, in addition, failed to adequately discuss, evaluate, and provide for his medical care.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-7\">Believing that his grievances had not been adequately remedied by prison administrators, Wheeler filed a <em>pro se </em>complaint in federal district court. Notably, when prompted with the statement \u201cI have exhausted the grievance system\u201d on his <em>pro se </em>complaint form, Wheeler marked \u2018Yes\u201d and attached a prison \u201cGrievance/DOR Appeal Transmittal\u201d dated March 20, 2001. On July 31, 2001, before Townsend filed an answer, the district court dismissed Wheeler\u2019s complaint <em>sua sponte </em>\u201cdue to [Wheeler\u2019s] failure to allege complete exhaustion of his administrative remedies.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b701-10\">The PLRA\u2019s exhaustion requirement is set forth in \u00a7 1997e(a), which states that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AUW\">[n]o action shall be brought with respect to prison conditions under section 1983 of this title, or any other Federal law, by a prisoner confined in any jail, prison, or other correctional facility until such administrative remedies as are available are exhausted.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b701-11\">42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1997e(a). While \u00a7 1997e(a) makes clear that exhaustion of administrative remedies is required to recover under the act, \u201c[w]e have rejected treating PLRA exhaustion as a pleading requirement or requiring exhaustion to be established by the complaint.\u201d <em>Wyatt v. Terhune, </em>315 F.3d 1108, 1120 (9th Cir.2003) (stating that \u201cnonexhaustion under \u00a7 1997e(a) of the PLRA does not impose a pleading requirement\u201d). Rather, \u201c \u00a7 1997e(a) creates a defense \u2014 defendants have the burden of raising and proving the absence of exhaustion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1119. Because, under <em>Wyatt, </em>the burden of raising and proving nonexhaustion lies with Townsend, not Wheeler, <em>see id., </em>the district court erred as a matter of law by requiring that Wheeler plead complete exhaustion in his complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-12\">Townsend acknowledges that the pleading requirement imposed by the district court conflicts with <em>Wyatt, </em>but nonetheless argues that nonexhaustion was so plain from the face of Wheeler\u2019s complaint that it either was \u201cfrivolous\u201d or \u201cfail[ed] to state a claim upon which relief can be granted\u201d and, therefore, warranted <em>sua sponte </em>dismissal under \u00a7 1997e(c)(l). We <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"672\">*672</page-number>trace this line of reasoning back to <em>Wyatt\u2019s </em>assertion, in <em>dicta, </em>that \u201c[a] prisoner\u2019s concession to nonexhaustion is a valid ground for dismissal.... \u201d <em>Wyatt, </em>315 F.3d at 1120 (stating that such a dismissal may be appropriate but noting that \u201c[t]he record is not clear ... that Wyatt has conceded [nonexhaustion]\u201d). Even were we to accept <em>Wyatt\u2019s dicta </em>as controlling, however, the district court here could not have <em>sua sponte </em>dismissed Wheeler\u2019s complaint under \u00a7 1997e(c)(l) because Wheeler did not concede nonexhaustion. On the contrary, Wheeler affirmatively asserted that he had exhausted all available administrative remedies.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-4\">In light of the foregoing, we conclude that the district court\u2019s <em>sua sponte </em>dismissal of Wheeler\u2019s complaint for nonexhaustion was both factually and legally erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-5\">REVERSED and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b701-8\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
