In 1982, he was sentenced to concurrent terms of imprisonment, the longest of which was twenty-five years to life. The Appellate Division affirmed his conviction, <em>People v. MacKenzie, </em>193 A.D.2d 700, 598 N.Y.S.2d 44 (N.Y.App.Div.1993), and he was denied leave to appeal to the Court of Appeals, <em>People v. MacKenzie, </em>82 N.Y.2d 722, 602 N.Y.S.2d 819, 622 N.E.2d 320 (1993). Having unsuccessftilly applied for a writ of error <em>coram nobis, see People v. MacKenzie, </em>244 A.D.2d 432, 665 N.Y.S.2d 552 (N.Y.App.Div.1997), MaeKenzie filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in the Eastern District of New York, which was denied in 2000. A certificate of appealability was granted on the issue of whether the introduction into evidence of inadmissible statements, through expert witnesses testifying as to petitioner\u2019s sanity, violated his constitutional rights. We affirm the district court\u2019s judgment denying MacKenzie\u2019s petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-6\">In addition to finding the erroneous introduction of the inadmissible statements harmless on account of other available evidence, the Appellate Division noted that \u201cthe defendant\u2019s liability for felony murder [under Penal Law \u00a7 125.25] does not depend on whether he momentarily lost his ability to form a conscious intent at the time he pulled the trigger, once it has been established beyond a reasonable doubt-as it has in this case-that the defendant was criminally responsible for the underlying felony.\u201d <em>People v. MacKenzie, </em>193 A.D.2d 700, 701-02, 598 N.Y.S.2d 44 (N.Y.App.Div. 1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b39-7\">We are bound by the Appellate Division\u2019s reading of New York\u2019s felony murder statute. <em>See Davis v. Strack, </em>270 F.3d 111, 123 n. 4 (\u201cIn determining whether a petitioner was entitled to a defense under state law, federal courts must of course defer to state-court interpretations of the state\u2019s laws, so long as those interpretations are themselves constitutional.\u201d) Under this interpretation of New York law, MacKenzie\u2019s criminal responsibility for the underlying felonies effectively establishes his responsibility for the crime of felony murder, so long as the death foreseeably resulted from the felonies. Petitioner contends that because the trial judge instructed the jury to consider the defendant\u2019s insanity defense to the felony murder charge, the introduction of the inadmissible statements might nevertheless have prejudiced the verdict. The defendant, however, does not have a constitutional right to the trial judge\u2019s erroneous application of state law in his favor. <em>See Bunkley v. Meachum, </em>68 F.3d 1518, 1522 (2d Cir.1995). Any error in the receipt of evidence tending to rebut petitioner\u2019s contention of insanity was therefore harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-8\">We have considered all of the petitioner\u2019s arguments and found them to be without merit. Accordingly, we AFFIRM the district court\u2019s denial of MacKenzie\u2019s petition for a writ of habeas corpus.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
