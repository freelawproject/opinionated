McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000); 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b321-14\">The respondent has filed a brief and the necessary documentation and concedes that Brown\u2019s 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 petition was timely filed. The state court records filed by the respondent indicate that Brown had a state habeas application pending from May 8,2002, until September 11, 2002. By operation of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)(2), which provides that the time during which a properly filed state habeas application is pending shall not be counted toward the limitations period, Brown\u2019s petition, which was signed on October 12, 2002, and filed on October 18, 2002, was timely filed. The district court\u2019s judgment is therefore VACATED.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-17\">The district court\u2019s dismissal was based solely on the time-bar analysis, without an analysis of the merits of Brown\u2019s claims. This case is therefore REMANDED to the district court for a determination of the merits of Brown\u2019s petition. <em>See Whitehead v. Johnson, </em>157 F.3d 384, 388 (5th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b321-18\">VACATED and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b321-15\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
