Williams also asserts that in the order denying his motion to amend the district court improperly permitted the Government to file a motion for summary judgment in his habeas litigation. The district court has since granted summary judgment in favor of the Government and dismissed his motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-7\">We have reviewed the record and conclude that Williams has not made \u201ca substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2) (2000); <em>see Miller-El v. Cockrell, </em>537 U.S. 322, 336, 123 S.Ct. 1029, 154 L.Ed.2d 931 (2003); <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000); <em>Rose v. Lee, </em>252 F.3d 676, 683 (4th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b242-8\">We therefore deny a certificate of appealability and dismiss the appeal. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid in the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-9\">\n<em>DISMISSED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
