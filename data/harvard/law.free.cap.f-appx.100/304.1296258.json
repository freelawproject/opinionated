California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967). Ramirez has responded after receiving a copy of counsel\u2019s motion and brief. He has not raised any appellate claims, but seeks appointment of new counsel to continue his case.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-23\">Ramirez\u2019s motion for new counsel is DENIED. Our independent review of the brief and the record discloses no nonfrivolous issue in this appeal. Accordingly, counsel\u2019s motion for leave to withdraw is GRANTED, counsel is excused from further responsibilities herein, and the APPEAL IS DISMISSED. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b334-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
