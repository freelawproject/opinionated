(\u201cABL\u201d), a juvenile, appeals from an order to transfer his case to adult status pursuant to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"688\">*688</page-number>mandatory transfer provisions of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 5032. ABL argues that because he was previously adjudicated delinquent by a judge rather than a jury, his prior delinquency adjudication did not constitute a \u201cfinding of guilt\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 5032 and therefore cannot serve as the basis for the mandatory transfer of his case to adult status under \u00a7 5032. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-5\">On March 31, 2003, the United States filed a two-count Information alleging that ABL had committed an act of juvenile delinquency on June 24, 2001, by engaging in conduct that would have constituted aggravated sexual assault, pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241(a), if committed by an adult, and kidnapping, pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1201(a)(2), if committed by an adult.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-6\">Soon after, the government filed a motion to transfer the case to district court pursuant to \u00a7 5032.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In granting the government\u2019s motion, the district court found that the case had been properly commenced as a juvenile proceeding; that the act charged in the present case was committed after ABL\u2019s sixteenth birthday; that the alleged conduct at issue in this case, kidnapping and aggravated sexual assault, would constitute felony crimes of violence if committed by an adult; and that ABL\u2019s prior adjudication for residential burglary counted as a crime of violence for purposes of \u00a7 5032. The district court ordered that ABL\u2019s case be transferred to federal court.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-10\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-11\">Whether the government complied with the requirements of \u00a7 5032 is a matter of statutory interpretation that is reviewed de novo. <em>United States v. Juvenile Male, </em>241 F.3d 684, 686 (9th Cir.2001). Questions regarding the constitutionality of \u00a7 5032 are also reviewed de novo. <em>United States v. Juvenile, </em>228 F.3d 987, 989 (9th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b718-12\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-13\">In <em>United States v. David H., </em>we squarely addressed, and rejected, ABL\u2019s argument that a prior adjudication of juvenile delinquency cannot serve as finding of guilt that triggers a mandatory transfer under \u00a7 5032. <em>See </em>29 F.3d 489, 493 (9th Cir.1994) (concluding that \u201cCongress necessarily intended the term \u2018found guilty\u2019 to include past juvenile delinquency adjudications\u201d). Nonetheless, ABL argues that our decision in <em>David H. </em>is in conflict with our more recent decisions in <em>United States v. Tighe, </em>266 F.3d 1187 (9th Cir.2001) and <em>Juvenile, </em>347 F.3d 778, because both <em>Tighe </em>and <em>Juvenile </em>call into question the reliability of the juvenile justice system and therefore challenge the holding of <em>David H. </em>that a juvenile delinquency adjudication may be a finding of guilt within the meaning of \u00a7 5032.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"689\">*689</page-number>ABL\u2019s attempt to distinguish <em>David H. </em>is unpersuasive. We did not hold in <em>David H. </em>that a juvenile adjudication is equivalent to an adult criminal conviction; rather, we interpreted \u00a7 5032 to apply to state court delinquency adjudications and concluded that \u201cCongress necessarily intended the term \u2018found guilty\u2019 to include past juvenile delinquency adjudications.\u201d <em>David H., </em>29 F.3d at 493.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-5\">Relying on the United States Supreme Court\u2019s recent decisions in <em>Jones v. United States, </em>526 U.S. 227, 119 S.Ct. 1215, 143 L.Ed.2d 311 (1999) and <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), ABL also contends that \u201conly when a \u2018conviction\u2019 has been achieved in the constitutional sense can his prior record be used to support mandatory transfer from juvenile to adult status.\u201d This argument is foreclosed by <em>United States v. Juvenile, </em>228 F.3d 987, 990 (9th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b719-6\">In <em>Juvenile, </em>we addressed, and rejected, the question of whether <em>Apprendi </em>applies to the transfer of a juvenile from juvenile status to adult status under \u00a7 5032. We further declined \u201cto analogize the transfer statute to statutes increasing the potential penalties in adult criminal cases, based upon a prior conviction, which can be obtained only after indictment (or waiver) and trial by jury (or guilty plea).\u201d <em>Id. </em>More recently, we held that <em>\u201cApprendi v. New Jersey </em>does not apply to transfer proceedings that allow the Government to try a juvenile as an adult.\u201d <em>United States v. Miguel, </em>338 F.3d 995, 996 (9th Cir.2003). These two cases therefore foreclose ABL\u2019s attempt to analogize the mandatory transfer in his case to the sentence enhancement at issue in <em>Apprendi.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b719-7\">In sum, ABL\u2019s arguments are foreclosed by our prior cases and ABL does not offer any convincing rationale for distinguishing those cases. The district court correctly concluded that ABL should be transferred to adult status pursuant to \u00a7 5032.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b717-27\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b718-7\">.
