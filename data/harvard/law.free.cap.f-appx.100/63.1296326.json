We assume familiarity with the agency proceedings and hereby deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-5\">1. <em>BIA\u2019s Summary Affirmance</em></p>\n<p id=\"b94-6\">Lin contends that the BIA\u2019s affirmance without opinion of the IJ\u2019s decision in his case constituted an abuse of its discretion. This argument is foreclosed by our rulings in <em>Yu Sheng Zhang v. United States Department of Justice, </em>362 F.3d 155, 157-58 (2d Cir.2004) (per curiam), and <em>Arango-Aradondo v. INS, </em>13 F.3d 610, 613 (2d Cir.1994). In short, because the IJ\u2019s decision \u201ccontains sufficient reasoning and evidence to enable [a reviewing court] to determine that the requisite factors were considered,\u201d <em>Arango-Aradondo v. INS, </em>13 F.3d at 613; <em>see Secaida-Rosales v. INS, </em>331 F.3d 297, 305 (2d Cir.2003), the BIA\u2019s summary affirmance is not a ground for granting Lin\u2019s petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-7\">2. <em>Denial of Lin\u2019s Application for Asylum and Withholding of Removal</em></p>\n<p id=\"b94-8\">Lin submits that the BIA\u2019s decision in his case is not supported by substantial evidence, <em>see Wu Biao Chen v. INS, </em>344 F.3d 272, 275 (2d Cir.2003) (per curiam); <em>Secaida-Rosales v. INS, </em>331 F.3d at 306\u2014 07, because the IJ erred in finding Lin\u2019s testimony at his asylum hearing not to be credible.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-10\">Lin confronts a heavy burden because we generally defer to the IJ\u2019s factual findings as to witness credibility as long as they are supported by \u201cspecific, cogent\u201d reasons, <em>Secaida-Rosales v. INS, </em>331 F.3d at 307 (internal quotation marks omitted), and substantial evidence, <em>see Wu Biao Chen v. INS, </em>344 F.3d at 275; <em>see also Jin Shui Oiu v. Ashcroft, </em>329 F.3d 140, 146 n. 2 (2d Cir.2003). We will reverse only on a showing that \u201ca reasonable fact finder would be compelled to credit [the applicant\u2019s] testimony.\u201d <em>Wu Biao Chen v. INS, </em>344 F.3d at 275-76 (citing <em>INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 481 &amp; n. 1, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992)). This is not such a case.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-11\">The IJ\u2019s \u201cnegative credibility finding\u201d was supported by \u201cmyriad inconsistencies\u201d both (1) between Lin\u2019s asylum application and his hearing testimony and (2) within his hearing testimony. IJ Oral Decision, Jan. 2, 2002, at 8. Lin submits that some of these inconsistencies were minor. We have ruled that in cases \u201c[w]here an applicant\u2019s testimony is generally consistent, rational, and believable,\u201d minor inconsistencies \u201cneed not be fatal to credibility.\u201d <em>Diallo v. INS, </em>232 F.3d 279, 288 (2d Cir.2000). In Lin\u2019s case, however, minor inconsistencies were not an exception to a generally consistent and believable account. To the contrary, inconsistencies, often with respect to events at the heart of his claim for relief, permeated Lin\u2019s testimony. Indeed, when Lin was afforded an opportunity to clarify some of the most troubling inconsistencies or to expand on vague testimony, <em>see generally Jin Shui Qiu v. Ashcroft, </em>329 F.3d at 152, more inconsistencies emerged. Under these circumstances, the IJ reasonably <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>concluded that Lin had not provided credible testimony. <em>See Ramsameachire v. Ashcroft, </em>357 F.3d 169, 182 (2d Cir.2004); <em>Secaida-Rosales v. INS, </em>331 F.3d at 308-09.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-5\">Lin does not dispute the existence of the identified inconsistencies; instead, he proffers various explanations to excuse them. Under the substantial evidence test, however, an applicant must offer more than a plausible explanation for his inconsistent statements; he must demonstrate that the IJ was <em>compelled </em>to credit his testimony. <em>See Wu Biao Chen v. INS, </em>344 F.3d at 275. As the Supreme Court has cautioned, a reviewing court cannot supplant an agency\u2019s findings of fact \u201cmerely by identifying alternative findings that could be supported by substantial evidence.\u201d <em>Arkansas v. Oklahoma, </em>503 U.S. 91, 113, 112 S.Ct. 1046, 117 L.Ed.2d 239 (1992). Accordingly, because the numerous inconsistencies identified by the IJ provide substantial evidence to support his adverse credibility finding, we defer to that decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-6\">We note that the IJ\u2019s rejection of Lin\u2019s claim of a well-founded fear of persecution in China was further supported by evidence that Lin had voluntarily returned to China in 1995 to visit his mother and exited without suffering any reprisals or recriminations.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-7\">In sum, we reject both Lin\u2019s claim that the BIA abused its discretion in summarily denying his application for asylum and withholding of removal and his claim that the decision was not supported by substantial evidence. Accordingly, we DENY his petition for review.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
