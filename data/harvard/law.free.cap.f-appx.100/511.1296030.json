The parties have waived oral argument and the panel unanimously agrees that oral argument is not needed in this case. Fed. R.App. P. 34(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b542-9\">Weliczko is a native and citizen of the Ukraine who entered the United States as a non-immigrant visitor on April 13, 1991, for a temporary period not to exceed October 15, 1991. Before his status expired, Weliczko applied for asylum based on his religion and nationality. Weliczko was interviewed by the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) six years later. The asylum officer found that Weliczko was not entitled to asylum because of changes in the conditions of the Ukraine. The INS subsequently started removal proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-12\">Nine years after first applying for asylum, an evidentiary hearing was held by an IJ. The IJ denied Weliczko asylum and voluntary departure. The IJ found that Weliczko\u2019s testimony was not credible and that the country\u2019s condition had changed. The Board affirmed the IJ\u2019s decision. Weliczko then sought review with this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-13\">The resolution of an asylum request involves a two-part inquiry. <em>Mikhailevitch v. INS, </em>146 F.3d 384, 389 (6th Cir.1998). Weliczko must show not only that he is a refugee, but also that his application merits a favorable exercise of administrative discretion. <em>See id. </em>The IJ did not reach the discretionary step here, as Weliczko did not meet his burden of showing that he is a refugee. A \u201crefugee\u201d is defined as an alien who is unable or unwilling to return to his home country \u201cbecause of persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42)(A); <em>accord INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 481, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992). A petition for judicial review should not be granted unless the evidence is so compelling that no reasonable fact-finder could fail to find the requisite fear of persecution. <em>Koliada v. INS, </em>259 F.3d 482, 486 (6th Cir.2001). Thus, the BIA\u2019s decision is conclusive unless it is \u201cmanifestly contrary to the law and an abuse of discretion.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(D).</p>\n<p id=\"b542-14\">An asylum application is also treated as an application for the withholding of removal. <em>Mikhailevitch, </em>146 F.3d at 391. However, the burden of proving eligibility for asylum is less than the burden of prov<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>ing entitlement to withholding. <em>Id. </em>Thus, the failure to show that Weliczko is eligible for asylum will also show that he is not entitled to the withholding of removal.</p>\n<p id=\"ALm\">\n<em>See id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b543-6\">Weliczko argues that the IJ\u2019s credibility finding was illogical. The IJ\u2019s factual determination regarding credibility, however, must be upheld unless \u201cany reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B). In the present case, the IJ cites several inconsistencies between Weliczko\u2019s written application, his testimony, and what was reported in the INS asylum interview. In addressing Weliczko\u2019s credibility, the IJ stated that she was troubled by the lack of evidence supporting Weliczko\u2019s alleged arrest. For example, Weliczko was allegedly arrested in 1980 at his home. At the time of this arrest, his mother was also home. When the arrest occurred, Weliczko\u2019s mother was allegedly pushed and struck by the arresting individuals. However, during the hearing, Weliczko\u2019s mother did not remember the incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-7\">Further, Weliczko\u2019s testimony and application for asylum were inconsistent regarding his alleged arrest and/or detentions. In addition, Weliczko was inconsistent as to the number of friends who were allegedly killed. Initially, Weliczko stated that he left the Ukraine because one of his friends was killed and because he lost his job. Weliczko subsequently changed the number of friends killed to two. Finally, Weliczko failed to present evidence regarding the religious conditions of the Ukraine prior to its independence.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-8\">Weliczko\u2019s challenge to the IJ\u2019s credibility finding is unpersuasive because the IJ properly noted the absence of corroborating evidence and the inconsistency in Weliczko\u2019s testimony which placed his credibility in doubt. <em>See Chebchoub v. </em>INS, 257 F.3d 1038, 1043-45 (9th Cir.2001); <em>Abdulai v. Ashcroft, </em>239 F.3d 542, 554-55 (3d Cir. 2001). Therefore, substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s credibility finding. <em>See Chebchoub, </em>257 F.3d at 1043-45.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-10\">Weliczko also argues that the IJ failed to consider the possibility that he could be persecuted based on his religious beliefs. The IJ properly noted that Weliczko\u2019s claim was undermined by a State Department report which indicated that conditions in the Ukraine had improved since Weliczko fled the country in 1991.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-11\">The evidence in this case does not compel a finding that Weliczko is a refugee because it does not show that he has a well-founded fear of persecution. <em>See Koliada, </em>259 F.3d at 487-88; <em>Chebchoub, </em>257 F.3d at 1045. Thus, the panel need not reach the question of whether Weliczko\u2019s asylum application merits a favorable exercise of discretion. <em>See Koliada, </em>259 F.3d at 488. Because Weliczko has not established eligibility for asylum, he is unable to meet the more rigorous standard of withholding of removal. <em>See Koliada, </em>259 F.3d at 489; <em>Mikhailevitch, </em>146 F.3d at 391. The Board\u2019s decision was not manifestly contrary to the law or an abuse of discretion as prescribed by \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(D).</p>\n<p id=\"b543-12\">Accordingly, the petition for judicial review is denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
