We agree with the district court that Ruhd\u2019s complaint failed to allege the amount in controversy or specify Liberty\u2019s citizenship, both its place of incorporation and its principal place of business, and therefore failed to satisfy the jurisdictional requirements of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b716-20\">Ordinarily, a party in Ruhd\u2019s position should be granted leave to amend his complaint to cure any jurisdictional defects. <em>See Montrose Chem. Corp. v. Am. Motorists Ins. Co., </em>117 F.3d 1128, 1136 (9th Cir.1997). This is so, \u201ceven if no request to amend the pleading was made.... \u201d <em>Cook, Perkiss &amp; Liehe, Inc. v. N. Cal. Collection Serv. Inc., </em>911 F.2d 242, 247 (9th Cir.1990). Such leave, however, need not be given where any amendment would be futile. <em>Id. </em>In this case, we conclude that leave to amend would have been futile in light of Ruhd\u2019s failure to exhaust his remedies before the Montana Workers\u2019 Compensation Court. <em>See </em>Mont.Code. Ann. \u00a7 33 \u2014 18\u2014242(6)(b); <em>O\u2019Connor v. Nat\u2019l Union Fire Ins. Co., </em>320 Mont. 301, 87 P.3d 454 (2004); <em>Grenz v. Orion Group, Inc., </em>243 Mont. 486, 795 P.2d 444 (1990). Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b716-21\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-22\">BEA, J. concurring.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b716-16\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b716-25\">. Because the district court's dismissal was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"687\">*687</page-number>without prejudice, Ruhd, if he elects to refile in federal court, can do so after exhausting his claims before the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b717-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"687\">*687</page-number>BEA, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b717-5\">I concur in the memorandum disposition and write to add that Ruhd can still exhaust his claims before the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court. Appellee conceded at oral argument that Ruhd\u2019s original filing of an application for benefits was timely and that the statute of limitations to file an action in the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court had not yet run for Ruhd\u2019s claims based on delay or refusal to pay workers\u2019 compensation benefits.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
