A motions panel of this Court granted McBride a Certificate of Appealability on the \u201cissue whether appellant is entitled to equitable tolling of the statute of limitations.\u201d We review de novo denials of habeas petitions on statute of limitations grounds. <em>Miles v. Prunty, </em>187 F.3d 1104, 1105 (9th Cir.1999). We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253 and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-12\">McBride\u2019s contention that he is entitled to equitable tolling because his habeas attorney miscalculated the AEDPA statute of limitations is foreclosed by <em>Frye v. Hickman, </em>273 F.3d 1144, 1146 (9th Cir.2001) and <em>Miranda v. Castro, </em>292 F.3d 1063, 1066-67 (9th Cir.2002). The record does not support McBride\u2019s claim that his failure to file the petition prior to the actual deadline was due to lack of access to the prison law library. McBride\u2019s argument that he was \u201cabandoned\u201d by his habeas attorney is also unpersuasive. His attorney had prepared a draft of the federal petition more than a month before the actual deadline and the ensuing delays were the result of McBride\u2019s disagreement with his attorney over the exclusion of several claims from the petition. Counsel\u2019s actions were not \u201cso egregious and atypical that the court may deem equitable tolling appropriate.\u201d <em>Ford v. Hubbard, </em>330 F.3d 1086, 1106 (9th Cir.2003), <em>cert. granted, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 124 S.Ct. 981, 157 L.Ed.2d 811 (2004)</p>\n<p id=\"b667-15\">McBride also argues that his untimely habeas petition should pass through the \u201cactual innocence gateway,\u201d because he is innocent of one of the convictions underlying his sentence enhancement. <em>See Schlup v. Delo, </em>513 U.S. 298, 315, 115 S.Ct. 851, 130 L.Ed.2d 808 (1995); <em>Sawyer v. Whitley, </em>505 U.S. 333, 348, 112 S.Ct. 2514, 120 L.Ed.2d 269 (1992). This Circuit has not resolved whether the actual innocence doctrine applies to non-capital appellants who challenge convictions that form the basis for sentence enhancements. We need not do so here, since McBride has not presented sufficient evidence of actual innocence to proceed through the gateway. The rap sheet detailing McBride\u2019s prior convictions strongly suggests that he was convicted in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"638\">*638</page-number>1974 for the sale of controlled substances and sentenced to 60 months probation.</p>\n<p id=\"AUT\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b667-11\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
