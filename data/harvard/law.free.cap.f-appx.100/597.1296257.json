Having carefully reviewed the record, <em>see Beck v. Skon, </em>253 F.3d 330, 332-33 (8th Cir.2001) (standard of review), we agree with the district court that Risdal failed to create any trialworthy issues regarding his failure-to-protect claim, <em>see Smith v. Gray, </em>259 F.3d 933, 934 (8th Cir.2001) (per curiam) (prison official\u2019s failure to alleviate significant risk that should have been, but was not, perceived cannot be infliction of punishment); <em>Moody v. St. Charles County, </em>23 F.3d 1410, 1412 (8th Cir.1994) (to defeat summary judgment, party must substantiate allegations with sufficient probative evidence that would allow finding in party\u2019s favor on more than just speculation); and that he failed to state a claim under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act. We also conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Risdal\u2019s motion to compel, <em>see In re Mo. Dep\u2019t of Nat. Res., </em>105 F.3d 434, 435 (8th Cir.1997) (scope of review of discovery orders is narrow and deferential); in placing defendant Galloway\u2019s affidavit and its attachments under seal, <em>cf. Meyer Goldberg, Inc. v. Fisher Foods, Inc., </em>823 F.2d 159, 161 (6th Cir.1987) (request to lift or modify order sealing documents is left to sound discretion of trial court); or in denying appointed counsel, <em>see Edgington v. Mo. Dep\u2019t of Corr., </em>52 F.3d 777, 780 (8th Cir.1995) (standard of review; discussing factors). Finally, we reject Risdal\u2019s contentions concerning judicial bias, as adverse rulings alone are not grounds for bias or partiality motions. <em>See </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number><em>Lefkowitz v.
