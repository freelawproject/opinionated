The District Court sentenced defendant principally to a term of 60 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-5\">Defendant\u2019s sole claim on appeal is that the District Court failed to recognize that defendant\u2019s age and infirmity alone provided sufficient grounds for a downward departure. At sentencing, defendant sought downward departures based on numerous asserted facts: his recent diagnosis of late-stage colon cancer, his age of 71 years, his history of skin cancer, his constant pain due to herniated discs, his diabetes, and certain pressures he was under at the time he committed the offenses. The District Court noted that defendant was entitled to \u201cconsideration under Sections 5H1.1 and 5H1.4 of the sentencing guidelines for a downward departure,\u201d sections which relate to age and infirmity.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The Court concluded that a downward departure based on age or infirmity individually was not appropriate, but nonetheless departed downwardly pursuant to Section 5K2.0, based on the combination of factors presented.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Judge Batts therefore departed from the sentencing range of 135 to 168 months, otherwise dictated by the Guidelines, and sentenced defendant to 60 months. Defendant argues that the District Court, if it had correctly understood its power to depart based individually on defendant\u2019s age and infirmity, may have granted an even larger departure than it did.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-9\">\u201c \u2018[I]t is well established in this Circuit that a court\u2019s decision not to depart from the Guidelines is normally not appeal-able.\u201d\u2019 <em>United States v. Lainez-Leiva, </em>129 F.3d 89, 93 (2d Cir.1997) (quoting <em>United States v. Brown, </em>98 F.3d 690, 692 (2d Cir.1996)). The only exceptions to this rule are \u201cwhere the defendant shows that a violation of the law occurred, that the Guidelines were misapplied, or that the refusal to depart was based on the sentencing court\u2019s mistaken conclusion that it lacked the authority to depart.\u201d <em>Lainez-Leiva, </em>129 F.3d at 93.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-10\">Where a defendant asserts that the district court misunderstood its authority to depart, we apply a \u201cstrong presumption\u201d that \u201cdistrict judges understand the much-discussed processes by which they may, in circumstances permitted by law, exercise discretion to depart from the sentencing range prescribed by the Guidelines calculus.\u201d <em>United States v. Brown, </em>98 F.3d 690, 694 (2d Cir.1996). We can find no evidence in the record to overcome such a presumption. It is clear that Judge Batts denied a downward departure that was based solely on age or infirmity, not because she concluded that she lacked authority to depart, but because she saw such a departure as inappropriate. <em>See United States v. Whittaker, </em>999 F.2d 38, 43 (2d Cir.1993) (refusing to review an appeal where the record showed that \u201cthe district court denied a downward departure be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"844\">*844</page-number>cause it concluded that such departure would not be appropriate, not because it concluded it had no authority to depart\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b874-4\">Nor did the District Court misapply the Guidelines by declining to grant defendant a downward departure based on age or infirmity alone. Even if defendant had established his eligibility for departures under Sections 5H1.1 or 5H1.4, the language of those sections authorizes, but does not require, a departure. We therefore cannot review the District Court\u2019s decision that such a departure under Sections 5H1.1 or 5H1.4 was inappropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-5\">We have considered all of defendant\u2019s arguments and found his claim to be unreviewable. Accordingly, defendant\u2019s appeal is DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b873-6\">. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5H1.1 provides that \"age maybe a reason to impose a sentence below the applicable guideline range when the defendant is elderly and infirm and where a form of punishment such as home confinement might be equally efficient as and less costly than incarceration.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5H1.4 provides that \"an extraordinary physical impairment may be a reason to depart downward.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b873-11\">. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K2.0 recognizes the authority of a district court to depart downwardly in certain \"exceptional\u201d cases \u201cbased on a combination of two or more offender characteristics or other circumstances, none of which 1 independently is sufficient to provide a basis for departure.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
