Mr. Warren moved for entry of default, and the VA moved for dismissal or summary judgment. The district court<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> held that Mr. Warren\u2019s action was barred because he had not timely exhausted his administrative remedies, and that he was not entitled to default judgment. Mr. Warren appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-25\">Having carefully reviewed the record and the parties\u2019 briefs, we agree that Mr. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>Warren\u2019s complaint was time barred as he did not exhaust his administrative remedies by timely pursuing his administrative complaint, <em>see </em>29 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 1614.105, 1614.106; <em>Jensen v. Henderson, </em>315 F.3d 854, 859 (8th Cir.2002), and thus he was not entitled to entry of default, <em>see </em>Fed. R.Civ.P. 55(e) (no judgment by default shall be entered against United States agency unless claimant establishes claim or right to relief by evidence satisfactory to court). Accordingly, we affirm. <em>See </em>8th Cir. R. 47B.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b622-15\">. The Honorable Paul A.
