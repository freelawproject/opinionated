Brown also appeals the district court\u2019s judgment entered after a bench trial on her claim brought under the Washington Public Disclosure Act, Wash. Rev.Code \u00a7 42.17 (\u201cPDA\u201d), and the district court\u2019s denial of her Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 59(e) motion for a new trial. We have jurisdiction over this timely appeal pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm. Because the parties are familiar with the facts, we recite them herein only as necessary to our disposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-5\">The district court did not abuse its discretion when it denied Brown\u2019s Rule 60(b) motion for relief from the summary judgment dismissal of four of her claims. The district court had already found that the Superior Court\u2019s failure to produce the poster was not the result of fraud or bad faith. Moreover, the poster was irrelevant to the district court\u2019s conclusion that Brown was not discharged and was not treated differently than similarly situated co-workers. Brown\u2019s claims of legal error are simply not the type of \u201cmistake\u201d that justifies relief under Rule 60(b). <em>See Casey v. Albertson\u2019s, Inc., </em>362 F.3d 1254, 1261 (9th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b686-6\">The district court did not err when it found that Brown\u2019s public disclosure request did not require the Superior Court to provide Brown with a copy of three emails between Superior Court employees in which Brown was discussed. Brown\u2019s request stated, \u201c[i]f any other files or documents regarding Lisa Brown are maintained, indicate the existence of these documents, the locations of the documents and the custodian of the documents in your response.\u201d Brown\u2019s request was not for a particular public record. It did not describe a document in a manner that would assist the person searching for the record. To the contrary, it asked for information about possible documents. The PDA does not require the agency to respond to a request for information about a public record. <em>See Smith v. Okanogan County, </em>100 Wash.App. 7, 994 P.2d 857, 863 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b686-9\">The district court did not abuse its discretion when it awarded Brown the minimum statutory penalty of $5 per day for 484 days for the Superior Court\u2019s PDA violation. Because the Superior Court\u2019s failure to produce the poster was an oversight and it was the only document withheld, it was not an abuse of discretion to award the minimum penalty. <em>See Amren v. City of Kalama, </em>131 Wash.2d 25, 929 P.2d 389, 396 (1997). Similarly, the district court\u2019s determination that the penalty should be calculated from the date the Superior Court produced their response to Brown\u2019s request was not an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-10\">The district court did not abuse its discretion when it denied Brown\u2019s request for attorney fees and costs pursuant to the PDA. The Superior Court prevailed on three of the four allegations of failure to disclose pubic records. Thus, Brown was not a prevailing party and was not entitled to an award of attorney fees. <em>See Smith, </em>994 P.2d at 868.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-11\">Because Brown did not brief the issue of the district court\u2019s denial of her Rule 59(e) motion, she has waived her right to raise <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"657\">*657</page-number>that issue on appeal. <em>See Doty v. County of Lassen, </em>37 F.3d 540, 548 (9th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b687-5\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b686-7\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
