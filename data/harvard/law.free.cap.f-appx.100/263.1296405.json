He also appeals from the magistrate judge\u2019s conclusion that his motion pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 59, filed more than ten days after the entry of final judgment, must be construed as a motion pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 60. Finally, he appeals the denial of the of Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(b) motion following a jury verdict for the defendants in this 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 suit. Also pending before this court is Leverton\u2019s motion to supplement the record on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-10\">If necessary, this court must examine the basis of its jurisdiction on its own motion. <em>Mosley v. Cozby, </em>813 F.2d 659, 660 (5th Cir.1987). A timely notice of appeal is a prerequisite to the exercise of jurisdiction by this court. <em>Dison v. Whitley, </em>20 F.3d 185, 186 (5th Cir.1994). On April 24, 2003, Leverton filed a notice of appeal from the July 19, 2001, denial of a Rule 60(b) motion in which Leverton sought relief from the grant of summary judgment in favor of defendant Dr. Russell McDonald. This notice of appeal, filed nearly two years after the denial of the motion and the August 14, 2001, entry of the final judgment, was untimely, and this court lacks jurisdiction over this appeal. <em>See Dison, </em>20 F.3d at 186.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-15\">Leverton complains that the magistrate judge erred in construing his Fed. R. Civ. P. 59 motion for a new trial as a motion for relief from the judgment pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 60. Motions pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 59 must be filed within 10 days of <em>entry, </em>not service, of the judgment. <em>See </em>Fed. R. Civ. P. 59(a), (b), (e). Although Leverton filed a motion to extend time to file a motion for a new trial, a district court is not authorized to extend the time for filing such a motion. <em>See </em>Fed. R. Crv. P. 6(b). Finally, Leverton\u2019s motion for a new trial did not extend the time for filing a notice of appeal, as it was not filed within ten days of the entry of the final judgment. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(4)(A)(v) \u2014 (vi).</p>\n<p id=\"b295-17\">Because Leverton did not file a timely notice of appeal from the final judgment, this court will not address his contentions regarding non-final orders and matters that do not fall under Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(b). Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(b) allows the district court to relieve a party from a <em>final </em>judgment or order. A decision is final when it \u201cends the litigation on the merits and leaves nothing for the court to do but execute the judgment.\u201d <em>Coopers &amp; Lybrand v. Livesay, </em>437 U.S. 463, 467, 98 S. Ct. 2454, 57 L.Ed.2d 351 (1978) (internal quotations and citation omitted). Because a Rule 60(b) motion is not a substitute for a timely appeal, this court declines to address the issues Leverton raises that do not readily fit under one of the grounds enumerated in Rule 60. <em>See Halicki v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number><em>Louisiana Casino Cruises, Inc., </em>151 F.3d 465, 471 (5th Cir.1998). The matters Leverton raises in his brief that this court declines to address include the denials of the: motion for appointment of counsel, motion for a protective order, motion for a restraining order, motion to withdraw consent to proceed before a magistrate, and motion to supplement the witness list. <em>See Coopers &amp; Lybrand, </em>437 U.S. at 467, 98 S.Ct. 2454; <em>Halicki </em>151 F.3d at 471.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-4\">Leverton complains that the magistrate judge abused his discretion in denying his August 31, 2001, motion for a new trial. Leverton has not met the requirements under Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(b)(2) for relief from the judgment based upon newly-discovered evidence that he demonstrate (1) that he exercised due diligence in obtaining the information and (2) that the evidence is material and controlling and clearly would have produced a different result if presented before the original judgment. <em>See Government Fin. Servs. One Ltd. Partnership v. Peyton Place, Inc., </em>62 F.3d 767, 770-71 (5th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b296-5\">Pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(b)(3), Leverton must show by clear and convincing evidence: (1) that the defendants engaged in fraud or other misconduct and (2) that the misconduct prevented him from fully and fairly presenting his case. <em>See id. </em>at 772. He has not shown that the defendants\u2019 actions in delaying his operation rose to a level of fraud or misconduct where the record showed that he could walk normally, his knee was not swollen or \u201cgrinding,\u201d the joint had a full range of motion, and X-rays detected no abnormalities. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b296-6\">Finally, the magistrate judge did not abuse his discretion in refusing to grant the motion pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(b)(6). Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(b)(6) allows a district court to \u201cdo justice in a particular case when relief is not warranted by the preceding clauses.\u201d <em>Government Fin. Servs., </em>62 F.3d at 773-74. The \u201cextraordinary circumstances\u201d required to grant a Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(b)(6) motion are not present in this case. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b296-8\">Finally, despite Leverton\u2019s assertion to the contrary, the magistrate judge was not required to provide Leverton with notice of either the consequences of summary judgment or the right to submit opposing affidavits. <em>See Martin v. Harrison County Jail, </em>975 F.2d 192, 193 (5th Cir.1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b296-9\">Leverton\u2019s motion to supplement the record on appeal is GRANTED.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-10\">DISMISSED IN PART; AFFIRMED IN PART; MOTION GRANTED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b295-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
