Counsel for Young has filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), in which he states there are no meritorious issues for appeal, but presents a sufficiency of the evidence claim as to each of Young\u2019s convictions. Young was informed of his right to file a pro se supplemental brief and has elected to do so. Finding no reversible error in Young\u2019s trial or sentence, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-22\">In reviewing Young\u2019s sufficiency of the evidence challenge, we bear in mind that \u201c[t]he verdict of the jury must be sustained if there is substantial evidence, taking the view most favorable to the Government, to support it.\u201d <em>Glasser v. United States, </em>315 U.S. 60, 80, 62 S.Ct. 457, 86 L.Ed. 680 (1942). \u201c[Sjubstantial evidence is evidence that a reasonable finder of fact could accept as adequate and sufficient to support a conclusion of a defendant\u2019s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>United States v. Burgos, </em>94 F.3d 849, 862 (4th Cir.1996) (en banc). The evidence established at Young\u2019s trial, largely unrebutted, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>substantially established his guilt as to all six counts. Thus, we reject his challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence on all counts as baseless.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-5\">We have examined the entire record in this case in accordance with the requirements of <em>Anders </em>and find no meritorious issues for appeal. Additionally, we reject the claims raised in Young\u2019s pro se supplemental brief as meritless. Accordingly, we affirm Young\u2019s convictions. This court requires that counsel inform his client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-6\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
