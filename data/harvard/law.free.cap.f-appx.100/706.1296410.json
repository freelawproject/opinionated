We agree with the district court\u2019s decision for substantially the same reasons set forth in its June 6, 2003, order and therefore affirm its decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-24\">\n<em>I. BACKGROUND</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b736-25\">The record indicates that in 1995, while on active duty in the United States Air Force, Mr. Rios was convicted by general court martial of the following offenses: (1) rape of a child under the age of sixteen; (2) sodomy of a child under the age of sixteen by force and without her consent; and (3) unlawfully striking and grabbing a child under the age of sixteen on two occasions. He was sentenced to eighteen years\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"707\">*707</page-number>When Mr. Rios began serving his sentence at the United States Disciplinary Barracks in Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, prison officials classified him as a maximum custody inmate. Within a month, prison officials reclassified him as a medium custody inmate, and Mr. Rios retained that classification for the next four years.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-5\">While incarcerated, Mr. Rios has been found guilty of several institutional offenses, including aggravated assault and maiming, as well as damaging and destroying property. These offenses resulted in his reclassification as a maximum custody inmate. While in maximum custody, Mr. Rios was charged and convicted of four additional offenses, the last of which occurred on December 13, 2000. Subsequently, it appears that Mr. Rios\u2019s behavior improved, and on July 9, 2001, prison officials reclassified him as a medium custody inmate.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-6\">In his \u00a7 2241 petition, Mr. Rios asserts that prison officials violated his due process rights by (1) classifying him as a maximum custody inmate without a hearing; (2) allowing him to remain a maximum custody inmate without regularly reviewing that classification; and (3) removing him from his prison job without a hearing. Mr. Rios also alleges that (4) prison officials violated his Eighth Amendment right to be free from cruel and unusual punishment by denying him outdoor exercise and \u201cadequate living space\u201d while he was in maximum custody. Rec. doc. 1, at 7 (Petition, filed Nov. 22, 2000). Although Mr. Rios acknowledges that he was afforded a hearing on his disciplinary offenses, he contends that prison officials improperly employed the maximum custody classification as a substitute for disciplinary segregation. <em>See id. </em>at 6 (alleging that \u201crespondent has subjected petitioner[ ] to atypical and significant hardships indefinitely under the guise of a custody classification\u201d and that \u201cpetitioner [][has] been held in disciplinary segregation for 11 ... months\u201d) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b737-8\">In his prayer for relief, Mr. Rios seeks \u201ca declaration that the never ending punishment is unlawful, an injunction to be removed from the unlawful (atypical and significant) conditions, and administrative sentence credit of 10 days for each day held unlawfully in segregation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 7A. In addition, Mr. Rios seeks \u201ccredit for work abatement lost while in \u2018max custody\u2019/ segregation.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b737-9\">The district court concluded that Mr. Rios\u2019s allegations should be raised in a civil rights complaint rather than a \u00a7 2241 petition:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b737-10\">The crux of Rios\u2019 factual allegations is a challenge to his prolonged administrative segregation and its severe conditions. His requests for relief in the form of sentence credit for time spent in segregated confinement and without prison employment' are ... not supported by any legal authority. Such claims of entitlement to relief not warranted by the allegations in a pro se pleading do not transform the matter into a habeas corpus action. Furthermore, Rios\u2019 argument that he was held indefinitely in disciplinary segregation without due process under the guise of maximum custody does not indicate the loss of previously earned good time credit or other challenges to disciplinary proceedings which may be reviewed in a petition for a writ of habeas corpus.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b737-11\">Rec. doc. 16, at 7-8 (Order, filed June 6, 2003). The court therefore dismissed Mr. Rios\u2019s petition without prejudice to the filing of a civil rights complaint challenging the condition of his confinement.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"708\">*708</page-number>\n<em>II. DISCUSSION</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b738-4\">In his appellate brief, Mr. Rios argues that the district court erred in failing to conduct a <em>\u201cSandin </em>analysis.\u201d Aplt\u2019s Br. at 3. He maintains that the conditions to which he was subjected in maximum custody affected a liberty interest because they constituted an \u201catypical and significant hardship [upon him] in relation to the ordinary incidents of prison life.\u201d <em>Sandin v. Conner, </em>515 U.S. 472, 484, 115 S.Ct. 2293, 132 L.Ed.2d 418 (1995). As a result, Mr. Rios maintains, he could not be placed in maximum custody without some procedural protections. Mr. Rios also argues that prison officials violated his due process rights by reviewing his placement in maximum custody only once a year. Finally, Mr. Rios asserts that \u201cadministrative sentence credit\u201d constitutes an appropriate request for relief in this \u00a7 2241 proceeding because he is barred from seeking monetary relief under the <em>Feres </em>doctrine. <em>See generally Feres v. United States, </em>340 U.S. 135, 146, 71 S.Ct. 153, 95 L.Ed. 152 (1950) (holding that the United States is immune from monetary damages for \u201cinjuries to servicemen where the injuries arise out of or are in the course of activity incident to service\u201d); <em>Walden v. Bartlett, </em>840 F.2d 771, 774 (10th Cir.1988) (holding that the <em>Feres </em>doctrine bars a military prisoner\u2019s claims for monetary damages).</p>\n<p id=\"b738-5\">Mr. Rios\u2019s arguments raise legal issues that we examine de novo. <em>See Khan v. Hart, </em>943 F.2d 1261, 1262 (10th Cir.1991). Upon review of the record, we agree with the district court\u2019s analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-6\">As the district court noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b738-7\">Petitions under \u00a7 2241 are used to attack the execution of a sentence.... [Although a \u00a7 2241 attack on the execution of a sentence may challenge some matters that occur at prison, such as deprivation of good-time credits and other prison disciplinary matters, this does not make \u00a7 2241 actions like condition of confinement lawsuits, which are brought under civil rights laws. A habeas corpus proceeding attacks the fact or duration of a prisoner\u2019s confinement and seeks the remedy of immediate release or a shortened period of confinement. In contrast, a civil rights action ... attacks the conditions of the prisoner\u2019s confinement and requests monetary compensation for such conditions.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b738-10\"><em>McIntosh v. United States Parole Comm\u2019n, </em>115 F.3d 809, 812 (10th Cir.1997) (internal citations and quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b738-11\">Here, Mr. Rios\u2019s allegations address the conditions of his confinement and thus should be raised in a civil rights action. Although in his prayer for relief Mr. Rios seeks a ten-day sentence credit for each day he has allegedly served improperly in maximum custody, he provides no support for his contention that he would be entitled to such relief if he prevailed on his substantive claims. Instead, the requested sentence credit appears to be an attempt to avoid the strictures of the <em>Feres </em>doctrine.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In our view, a prisoner may not transform a civil rights action involving the conditions of his confinement into a \u00a7 2241 petition merely by seeking sentencing relief in a manner not connected to his substantive claims. <em>Cf. Hadley v. Holmes, </em>341 F.3d 661, 665 (7th Cir.2003) (holding that the possibility that a prisoner\u2019s claim had the potential to affect the duration of his confinement was \u201ctoo attenuated from this proceeding to state a claim under \u00a7 2254\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b739-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"709\">*709</page-number>\n<em>III. CONCLUSION</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b739-5\">Accordingly, we AFFIRM the district court\u2019s dismissal of Mr. Rios\u2019s 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 petition without prejudice to the filing of a civil rights complaint.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b736-16\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. The court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b738-8\">. Moreover, the <em>Feres </em>doctrine is not as broad as Mr. Rios suggests: this court has held that \"[a military prisoner's] claims for injunctive and declaratory relief [were] not barred by the <em>Feres </em>doctrine.\u201d <em>Walden, </em>840 F.2d at 775.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
