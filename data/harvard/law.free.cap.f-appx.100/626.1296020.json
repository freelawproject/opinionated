See Fed.

The district court denied the petition. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-7\">In 1996, a Yakima County jury convicted Shafer on five counts of First Degree Rape of Child, two counts of First Degree Child Molestation, and one count of Attempted First Degree Child Molestation, all arising from Shafer\u2019s rape and molestation of three young girls. At trial, the prosecution presented two expert witnesses: Robyn Light, an expert in interviewing child sexual abuse victims; and Dr. Roy Simms, a pediatrician who had conducted a physical examination of one of Shafer\u2019s alleged victims.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-8\">Shafer contends that the trial court erred in admitting the testimony of Ms. Light and Dr. Simms, and that these errors violated his right to due process. Shafer argues that the district court should not have admitted Ms. Light\u2019s testimony because: (1) the sensory perception hypothesis on which her testimony was based is not an accepted or scientifically supported theory; (2) her testimony was based on out-of-court statements made by Shafer\u2019s alleged victims to a third party; and (3) her testimony improperly vouched for the credibility of the alleged victims. Shafer contends that the district court should not have admitted Dr. Simms\u2019s testimony because his diagnosis that one of Shafer\u2019s alleged victims had been abused was based solely on statements made by the alleged victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-12\">Even if we were to assume that the admission of the contested testimony was erroneous, that would not in itself supply a ground for habeas relief under clearly established federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d). For that reason, we deny Shafer\u2019s petition. The United States Supreme Court has squarely held that not every evidentiary error at trial is sufficiently prejudicial to warrant habeas relief. <em>Brecht v. Abrahamson, </em>507 U.S. 619, 637, 113 S.Ct. 1710, 123 L.Ed.2d 353 (1993). \u201cUnder this standard, habeas petitioners may obtain plenary review of their constitutional claims, but they are not entitled to habeas relief based on trial error unless they can establish that it resulted in actual prejudice.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 637, 113 S.Ct. 1710 (internal quotation marks omitted). An evidentiary error is harmless unless \u201crecord review leaves the conscientious judge in grave doubt about the likely effect of an error on the jury\u2019s verdict.\u201d <em>O\u2019Neal v. McAninch, </em>513 U.S. 432, 435, 115 S.Ct. 992, 130 L.Ed.2d 947 (1995). We consider \u201cwhat effect the error had or reasonably may be taken to have had upon the jury\u2019s decision.\u201d <em>Kotteakos v. United States, </em>328 U.S. 750, 764, 66 S.Ct. 1239, 90 L.Ed. 1557 (1946).</p>\n<p id=\"b657-13\">There was overwhelming evidence, independent from the testimony of Ms. Light and Dr. Simms, by which the jury could only have determined Shafer\u2019s guilt. Particularly notable was the testimony of Lisa Ulrey, Shafer\u2019s former girlfriend and the mother of one of Shafer\u2019s victims, who at the time of Shafer\u2019s trial had pled guilty to being an accomplice to Shafer\u2019s alleged crimes. Ms. Ulrey testified that on many occasions she witnessed Shafer\u2019s sexual abuse of her daughter. In addition, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"628\">*628</page-number>jury heard testimony from each of Shafer\u2019s alleged victims. Thus, the total evidence presented does not establish that any evidentiary error had a \u201csubstantial and injurious effect or influence in determining the jury\u2019s verdict,\u201d <em>Kotteakos, </em>328 U.S. at 776, 66 S.Ct. 1239; <em>see also Brecht, </em>507 U.S. at 637, 113 S.Ct. 1710. Because Shafer failed to demonstrate that the Washington Court of Appeals\u2019s decision was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established federal law, the district court did not err in denying his petition. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b658-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b657-9\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
