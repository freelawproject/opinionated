Tubwell, </em>37 F.3d 175, 177 (5th Cir.1994). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>Because <em>pro se </em>pleadings must be liberally construed as seeking the proper remedy, Reed\u2019s motion will be treated as arising under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241. <em>See United States v. Robinson, </em>78 F.3d 172, 174 (5th Cir.1996). Because the district of incarceration is the same as the district of conviction, the Eastern District of Texas had jurisdiction to consider it. <em>See United States v. Weathersby, </em>958 F.2d 65, 66 (5th Cir.1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b289-5\">Even if it would be futile for Reed to exhaust his administrative remedies, Reed is not entitled to credit on his federal sentence for time spent in state custody prior to the imposition of the federal sentence because that period was credited against another sentence. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3585(b); <em>Vignera v. Attorney General </em>455 F.2d 637, 638 (5th Cir.1972). Accordingly, the district court\u2019s order is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b288-16\">. Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
