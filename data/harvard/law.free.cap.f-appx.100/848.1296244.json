Penal Law \u00a7 125.25(1), appeals from the district court\u2019s denial of a writ of habeas corpus. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254. We assume familiarity with the record of proceedings both in the federal and state courts and hereby affirm the district court\u2019s denial of the writ.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-17\">Nicholson claims that the state courts deprived him of due process when they ruled that the hearsay confession of Darnell Phelps was inadmissible. He submits that this runs afoul of <em>Chambers v. Mississippi </em>410 U.S. 284, 93 S.Ct. 1038, 35 L.Ed.2d 297 (1973), which holds that states cannot \u201cmechanistically\u201d exclude exculpatory evidence bearing \u201cpersuasive assurances of trustworthiness,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 302, 93 S.Ct. 1038. In <em>Chambers, </em>the error deprived the defendant of his due process right to a fair trial. Nicholson does not - and cannot - claim that he was the victim of a <em>Chambers </em>error at <em>trial; </em>his due process claim is that a <em>Chambers </em>error prompted the state courts to deny him a <em>new trial. </em>The parties have not addressed whether such a claim is cognizable on habeas review. <em>See Herrera v. Collins, </em>506 U.S. 390, 408, 113 S.Ct. 853, 122 L.Ed.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"850\">*850</page-number>203 (1993) (\u201cThe Constitution ... makes no mention of new trials.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b880-4\">Assuming that <em>Chambers </em>does apply to retrial motions, Nicholson is, nevertheless, not entitled to habeas relief because he fails to show that the state courts \u201cmechanistically\u201d rejected reliable hearsay evidence in his case. Due process is not violated by evidentiary rules - whether federal or state - requiring a clear demonstration of trustworthiness as a precondition to the admission of a hearsay statement against penal interest offered to exculpate the accused. <em>See Chambers v. Misssissippi, </em>410 U.S. at 302 (observing that in offering evidence, a defendant \u201cmust comply with established rules of procedure and evidence designed to assure both fairness and reliability in the ascertainment of guilt and innocence\u201d); <em>see also United States v. Beltempo, </em>675 F.2d 472, 479 (2d Cir.1982) (holding that the reliability requirement in Fed.R.Evid. 804(b)(3) comports with Chambers). Trial judges are afforded considerable discretion in making such reliability assessments, <em>see United States v. Jackson, </em>335 F.3d 170, 179 (2d Cir.2003); <em>People v. Shortridge, </em>65 N.Y.2d 309, 315, 491 N.Y.S.2d 298, 302, 480 N.E.2d 1080 (1985), and deference to their judgment is particularly appropriate on federal habeas review, <em>see Estelle v. McGuire, </em>502 U.S. 62, 67-68, 112 S.Ct. 475, 116 L.Ed.2d 385 (1991). The record in this case indicates no abuse of discretion depriving Nicholson of the \u201cfundamental fairness\u201d guaranteed by due process. <em>Id. </em>at 73, 112 S.Ct. 475.</p>\n<p id=\"b880-5\">The reliability of Phelps\u2019s confession, in contrast to the confession at issue in <em>Chambers v. Mississippi, </em>410 U.S. at 300-01, is hardly established by consistent repetition. To the contrary, Phelps\u2019s confession is inconsistent with his earlier statement denying any knowledge of the murder, indicating that on one occasion or the other he had certainly lied. Moreover, unlike in <em>Chambers, </em>it appears that in this case the reliability of Phelps\u2019s confession could not be tested by cross-examination at a retrial. Nicholson nevertheless argues that reliability is sufficiently established by the fact that Phelps\u2019s confession is more consistent with the forensics evidence than the testimony of the sole eyewitness. We are not convinced. The forensics evidence was public by the time of Phelps\u2019s confession; thus, he could have tailored his account to fit the experts\u2019 findings. Further, an eyewitness testified at trial that she saw Nicholson shooting the victim. That testimony was, moreover, corroborated to some degree by other persons at the scene who heard her shout what may have been Nicholson\u2019s first name. Although Nicholson\u2019s brief strongly attacks the eyewitness\u2019s credibility, he had the opportunity to present his arguments to the jury, which, having heard the witness\u2019s testimony and assessed her demeanor, nevertheless deemed her credible. <em>See Maldonado v. Scully, </em>86 F.3d 32, 35 (2d Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b880-7\">In any event, we note that Phelps\u2019s confession does not necessarily exonerate Nicholson and certainly assigns him a more active role in the events of the homicide than he disclosed in his own exculpatory statement to the authorities. Further, if the confession is to be believed, Nicholson has known of Phelps\u2019s own involvement in the murder since the night of the crime. But if that were the case, it is extremely curious that Nicholson himself never disclosed this fact, directly or through counsel, before trial. Nor did he attempt to cast blame on Phelps at trial, for example, through cross-examination of the eyewitness.</p>\n<p id=\"b880-8\">Precisely because Phelps\u2019s confession is suspect, Nicholson cannot demonstrate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"851\">*851</page-number>that the state court\u2019s denial of his motion for a new trial implicated his right to due process. Accordingly, the district court\u2019s denial of a writ of habeas corpus is hereby AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
