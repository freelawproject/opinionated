He argues he did not consent to an officer\u2019s search or, alternatively, that his unreasonable detention invalidated his consent. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-27\">We review for clear error a district court\u2019s factual determination that a defendant consented voluntarily to a search. <em>United States v. Ivy, </em>165 F.3d 397, 401 (6th Cir.1998). Both the magistrate judge, who held a hearing on this question, and the district court judge, who reviewed the magistrate\u2019s report and recommendation, found Wheeler consented to the search. The officer\u2019s testimony and a video of the stop support this conclusion. We discern no error in the district court\u2019s finding and thus reject Wheeler\u2019s argument that he did not consent to the search.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>We review for clear error the district court\u2019s findings of fact made with regard to a motion to suppress, and we review its legal conclusions de novo. <em>United States v. Elmore, </em>304 F.3d 557, 560 (6th Cir.2002). Our study of the appellate record, the applicable law, and the parties\u2019 briefs, convince us that the officer did not unreasonably detain Wheeler. The officer stopped him after observing his erratic driving and received his consent to search while a second officer prepared a warning citation, <em>before </em>the purpose for the stop concluded. We agree with the magistrate\u2019s conclusions \u2014 supplemented by the district court\u2019s opinion \u2014 that the officer did not unreasonably detain Wheeler.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-5\">Having rejected Wheeler\u2019s claims that he did not consent to the search and the officer unreasonably detained him, we affirm the district court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
