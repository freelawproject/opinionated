For the reasons that follow, we will deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-24\">We review the BIA\u2019s denial of a motion to reopen for abuse of discretion. <em>INS v. Abudu, </em>485 U.S. 94, 105, 108 S.Ct. 904, 99 L.Ed.2d 90 (1988). We reverse only if the decision is \u201carbitrary, irrational, or contrary to law.\u201d <em>Sevoian v. Ashcroft, </em>290 F.3d 166, 174 (3d Cir.2002) (citation omitted). Motions to reopen in deportation proceedings shall not be granted unless it appears to the BIA that evidence sought to be offered is material and was not available and could not have been discovered or presented at the former hearing. <em>INS v. Doherty, </em>502 U.S. 314, 323, 112 S.Ct. 719, 116 L.Ed.2d 823 (1992); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 3.2(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b113-25\">Because we write only for the parties who are familiar with the facts and issues presented for review, we only recite those necessary to the discussion. Melgar filed his motion to reopen along with accompanying affidavits on October 4, 2002, asserting that he was eligible for an adjustment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>of status to permanent resident based upon his second marriage to a naturalized citizen of the United States.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> But the BIA denied his motion to reopen because in the absence of exceptional circumstances, he is ineligible for the relief of adjustment of status for his failure to comply with the BIA\u2019s prior order of August 30, 2001, granting him voluntary departure rather than deportation. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252b(e)(5) (1995) (providing that an alien who fails to voluntarily depart is ineligible for an adjustment of status).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b114-4\">We conclude that the BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying Melgar\u2019s motion to reopen. Melgar was provided the opportunity to voluntarily depart and chose not to do so. He therefore is statutorily barred from applying for certain forms of discretionary relief absent exceptional circumstances (such as his serious illness or death of an immediate relative) beyond his control. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252b(f) (1995). Neither the motion to reopen nor its supporting affidavits (which the BIA considered) meet this high threshold for discretionary relief. Despite the fact that Melgar will leave behind his two minor daughters, ages 6 and 4, who are United States citizens, he simply did not meet the requirements for discretionary relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-5\">We have reviewed all of the contentions raised by the parties and conclude that no further discussion is required. The petition for review will be DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b114-7\">. The BIA noted, and we agree, that Melgar\u2019s motion to reopen was untimely in that it was filed beyond 90 days after the final decision by the Board. See 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 3.2(c)(2). The motion to reopen would have been due on or before November 28, 2001, and was not filed until January 10, 2003.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b114-20\">. As proceedings were commenced prior to April 1, 1997, our jurisdiction is premised on former section 106(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1105a(a) (1995), as modified by the transitional rules for judicial review contained in section 309(c)(4) of the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigration Responsibility Act of 1996. <em>See Liang v. INS, </em>206 F.3d 308, 310 (3d Cir.2000).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
