After an evidentiary hearing, an immigration judge found him ineligible for asylum, withholding of deportation, or relief under the United Nations Convention Against Torture.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Because Saade did not otherwise contest his removability, the immigration judge ordered his deportation to Lebanon. The Board of Immigration Appeals summarily affirmed that decision, and this petition for review followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-24\">This court\u2019s review of the immigration judge\u2019s decision<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> is narrowly circumscribed. To reverse the immigration judge\u2019s factual findings, we \u201cmust find that the evidence not only <em>supports </em>that conclusion, but <em>compels </em>it.\u201d <em>INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 481 n. 1, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992); <em>see </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B). The immigration judge\u2019s application of the relevant legal standards to his factual circumstances is entitled to substantial deference as well. <em>INS v. Cardoza-Fonseca, </em>480 U.S. 421, 448, 107 S.Ct. 1207, 94 L.Ed.2d 434 (1987); <em>Alvarez-Flores v. INS, </em>909 F.2d 1, 3-4, 5 (1st Cir.1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b869-25\">Under those standards, the immigration judge\u2019s decision in this case easily survives <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"840\">*840</page-number>review. To be eligible for asylum, Saade had to prove that he \u201cis unable or unwilling to return to ... [his] country because of persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution on account of ... political opinion.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1101(a)(42), 1158(b)(1); <em>see also </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.13(b); <em>Ravindran v. INS, </em>976 F.2d 754, 758 (1st Cir.1992). Even putting credibility issues aside and viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the petitioner, we are not \u201ccompelled\u201d to conclude that Saade was persecuted in the past or has a well-founded fear of being persecuted in the future on account of his political opinions.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-4\">Further assuming, without deciding, that Saade had accomplished the \u201cdaunting task,\u201d <em>Guzman v. INS, </em>327 F.3d 11, 15 (1st Cir.2003), of proving past persecution or a well-founded fear of future persecution, the immigration judge still would have been justified in finding him ineligible for asylum based on his failure to demonstrate the required nexus between the alleged persecution and his political opinions. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.13(b)(1) and (2)(i)(A); <em>Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. at 483, 112 S.Ct. 812; <em>Guzman, </em>327 F.3d at 15. The immigration judge\u2019s conclusion that no such nexus had been shown is amply supported by the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-5\">Like the alien in <em>Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. at 483, 112 S.Ct. 812, Saade has failed to show that his alleged persecutors \u201cwill persecute him <em>because of </em>[his] political opinion, rather than because of his refusal to fight [or work] with them.\u201d Under those circumstances, the immigration judge correctly found him ineligible for asylum, and Saade has shown no compelling basis for us to reverse that result.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-6\">Because the standard for withholding of deportation is even more stringent than that for granting asylum, <em>INS v. Stevic, </em>467 U.S. 407, 428-29, 104 S.Ct. 2489, 81 L.Ed.2d 321 (1984), the immigration judge correctly concluded that if Saade was not eligible for asylum, then, <em>a fortiori, </em>he was not eligible for withholding of deportation either. <em>See Guzman, </em>327 F.3d at 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-8\">Accordingly, the petition for review is <em>denied </em>and the order of the Board of Immigration Appeals is <em>affirmed.</em></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b869-18\">. On appeal, Saade does not challenge the immigration judge\u2019s denial of relief under the Convention Against Torture.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b869-26\">. Because the Board of Immigration Appeals affirmed the immigration judge\u2019s decision without opinion, we review the decision of the immigration judge. <em>Albathani v. INS, </em>318 F.3d 365, 373 (1st Cir.2003).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
