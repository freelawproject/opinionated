Henderson appeals only his conviction under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(1)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b333-16\">Henderson argues that the factual basis for his guilty plea was inadequate as a matter of law because the factual resume did not establish that he possessed firearms \u201cin furtherance of\u2019 a drug-trafficking offense for purposes of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(1)(A). Because Henderson did not object to the factual basis for his plea in the district court, this court reviews the district court\u2019s acceptance of his guilty plea for plain error. <em>See United States v. Angeles-Mascote, </em>206 F.3d 529, 530 (5th Cir.2000). In determining whether the district court\u2019s acceptance of Henderson\u2019s guilty plea was plain error, this court reviews the record as a whole. <em>See United States v. Vonn, </em>535 U.S. 55, 59, 122 S.Ct. 1043, 152 L.Ed.2d 90 (2002); <em>United States v. Adams, </em>961 F.2d 505, 512-13 (5th Cir.1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b333-17\">The factual resume stated that Henderson possessed at his residence two firearms, one BFI .223 caliber semi-automatic assault rifle and one .45 caliber UZI pistol, along with nine pounds of marijuana. The record as a whole shows that Henderson conspired to distribute marijuana using his home and automobiles. Henderson\u2019s drug dealings sometimes involved murder, theft, and carjacking. A loaded and easily accessible semi-automatic rifle was found at his residence where a substantial amount of drugs and cash were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>also found. A loaded and easily accessible UZI pistol was found in a Lincoln Navigator that was parked in the driveway of Henderson\u2019s residence. These facts, taken from the record as a whole, show that Henderson possessed the two firearms in furtherance of his conspiracy to distribute marijuana in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(1)(A). <em>See United States v. Ceballos-Torres, </em>218 F.3d 409, 412-15 (5th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b334-4\">Inasmuch as the record contains sufficient facts to support the basis for Henderson\u2019s guilty plea, Henderson fails to meet his burden of showing that the district court committed plain error when it accepted his guilty plea. <em>See Vonn, </em>535 U.S. at 59, 122 S.Ct. 1043; <em>Adams, </em>961 F.2d at 512-13.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b333-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
