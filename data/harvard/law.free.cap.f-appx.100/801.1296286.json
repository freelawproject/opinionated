For the second time in the last five days, this court concludes that Bryan is not entitled to a stay of execution.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-8\">Bryan is a convicted murderer; he is scheduled to be executed by the state of Oklahoma at 6:00 p.m. today, June 8, 2004. At approximately 8:00 a.m. this morning, Bryan filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the District of Oklahoma. In that complaint, Bryan asserted that he is incompetent and that his execution by the state of Oklahoma would violate the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments. <em>See Ford v. Wainwright, </em>477 U.S. 399, 410, 106 S.Ct. 2595, 91 L.Ed.2d 335 (1986) (\u201cThe Eighth Amendment prohibits the State from inflicting the penalty of death upon a prisoner who is insane.\u201d). Bryan further asserted that he was entitled to seek an injunction barring his execution in federal district court pursuant to the provisions of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. The district court dismissed Bryan\u2019s complaint and denied his request for a stay of execution. According to the district court, Bryan had presented \u201cno indication of the likelihood he will succeed on the merits.\u201d Dist. Ct. Order at 3. The district court further concluded that the evidence Bryan relies on in support of his <em>Ford </em>claim \u201cprovides little to support his claim of insanity. In fact, both [prison] reports state Plaintiff was aware of his upcoming execution and its date, and further, that he has an understanding of the procedural posture of his case and the activities of his counsel.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b832-10\">This court concludes that Bryan\u2019s \u00a7 1983 complaint is, in actuality, a second or successive 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 habeas corpus petition. Thus, the district court lacked jurisdiction over the petition. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(b)(3)(A). We, therefore, vacate the district court\u2019s order denying Bryan\u2019s complaint on the merits. This court treats Bryan\u2019s appeal as an implied request to file a second or successive \u00a7 2254 petition. Because Bryan has not made a <em>prima facie </em>showing that his <em>Ford </em>claim satisfies the requirements of \u00a7 2244(b)(2), this court denies his request to file a second or successive \u00a7 2254 habeas petition and denies his request for a stay of execution.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-11\">Although Bryan asserts that he is entitled to proceed with his <em>Ford </em>claim in a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 action, he has not cited a single ease indicating that \u00a7 1983 is the proper vehicle to litigate a <em>Ford </em>claim. Instead, Bryan relies on the Supreme Court\u2019s recent decision in <em>Nelson v. Campbell, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 124 S.Ct. 2117, 2122-24, 158 L.Ed.2d 924 (2004). In <em>Nelson, </em>the Supreme Court held that the plaintiff could challenge a \u201ccut-down\u201d procedure Alabama officials planned to use to effectuate the execution of the plaintiff. <em>Id. </em>In <em>Nelson, </em>however, the Court was careful to note that the plaintiffs challenge was narrowly directed to a particular method of effectuating the lethal injection of the plaintiff. <em>Id. </em>at 2122 (\u201cBut petitioner has been careful throughout these proceedings, in his complaint and at oral argument, to assert that the cut-down, as well as the warden\u2019s refusal to provide reliable information regarding the cut-down protocol, are <em>wholly unnecessary </em>to gaining venous access. Petitioner has alleged alternatives that, if they had been used, would have allowed the State to proceed with the exe<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"803\">*803</page-number>cution as scheduled.\u201d). Because Bryan is challenging the fact of his execution, as opposed to the narrow method in which his execution will be effectuated as in <em>Nelson, </em>he must proceed under \u00a7 2254. <em>See generally, e.g., Nguyen v. Gibson, </em>162 F.3d 600 (10th Cir.1998) (reviewing <em>Ford </em>claim under \u00a7 2254).</p>\n<p id=\"b833-5\">It is likewise clear that Bryan\u2019s attempt to raise a <em>Ford </em>claim at this late date is subject to the provisions of \u00a7 2244(b) restricting the filing of second or successive \u00a7 2254 habeas petitions. Bryan has previously filed a \u00a7 2254 habeas petition. That \u00a7 2254 habeas petition did not contain a <em>Ford </em>claim. Under these circumstances, this court has held that Bryan\u2019s subsequently filed <em>Ford </em>claim must be treated as a second or successive habeas application. <em>Nguyen, </em>162 F.3d at 601. <em>But see id. </em>at 602-04 (Briscoe, J., dissenting) (asserting that the provisions of \u00a7 2244(b) are not applicable to a <em>Ford </em>claim because those provisions only apply to a claim that could have been raised in a previous \u00a7 2254 habeas petition and because <em>Ford </em>claims do not become ripe until an execution is imminent). Thus, to be entitled to raise his <em>Ford </em>claim before the district court in a second \u00a7 2254 habeas petition, Bryan must satisfy the gate keeping requirements of \u00a7 2244(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b833-6\">The AEDPA strictly limits the filing of second or successive \u00a7 2254 habeas petitions. According to \u00a7 2244(b),</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b833-7\">(1) A claim presented in a second or successive habeas corpus application under section 2254 that was presented in a prior application shall be dismissed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b833-9\">(2) A claim presented in a second or successive habeas corpus application under section 2254 that was not presented in a prior application shall be dismissed unless\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b833-10\">(A) the applicant shows that the claim relies on a new rule of constitutional law, made retroactive to cases on collateral review by the Supreme Court, that was previously unavailable; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b833-11\">(B) (i) the factual predicate for the claim could not have been discovered previously through the exercise of due diligence; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b833-12\">(ii) the facts underlying the claim, if proven and viewed in light of the evidence as a whole, would be sufficient to establish by clear and convincing evidence that, but for constitutional error, no reasonable factfinder would have found the applicant guilty of the underlying offense.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b833-13\">28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(b)(1), (2). This court may authorize the filing of a second or successive \u00a7 2254 petition \u201conly if [we] determine[ ] that the application makes a prima facie showing that the application satisfies the requirements of\u2019 \u00a7 2244(b)(1) and (2). 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(b)(3)(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b833-14\">Bryan cannot satisfy the requirements of \u00a7 2244(b)(2)(A) because the Supreme Court decided <em>Ford </em>in 1986. <em>Nguyen, </em>162 F.3d at 601. Nor can Bryan meet the requirements of \u00a7 2244(b)(2)(B).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> First, in light of Bryan\u2019s well-documented history of mental illness, there is simply no question that the factual predicates of Bryan\u2019s <em>Ford </em>claim could have previously been discovered and presented to this court through the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"804\">*804</page-number>exercise of due diligence. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(b)(2)(B)(i). For that reason alone, Bryan has failed to make a <em>prima facie </em>case that his <em>Ford </em>claim satisfies the requirements of \u00a7 2244(b). Furthermore, the letter submitted by Dr. Kathie Ward, a psychologist with the Oklahoma Department of Corrections, to Warden Mike Mullin, does not alter this court\u2019s conclusion that Bryan\u2019s <em>Ford </em>claim could, through the exercise of due diligence, have been raised in Bryan\u2019s first habeas petition. The letter from Dr. Ward, to the extent it does reflect upon Bryan\u2019s detachment from reality, indicates nothing more than what was contained in the record before this court on Bryan\u2019s first \u00a7 2254 habeas petition. In any event, Dr. Ward\u2019s letter\u2014 which simply indicates that although Bryan understands the concept of execution, he believes he will be exonerated rather than executed' \u2014 is simply insufficient to justify an evidentiary hearing on present incompetence to be executed. Accordingly, Bryan also fails to satisfy the requirements of \u00a7 2244(b)(2)(B)(ii), no matter how those provisions are construed to apply to a <em>Ford </em>claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-4\">Because Bryan has failed to satisfy the requirements of \u00a7 2244(b) this court DENIES his implied request to file a second or successive habeas petition and DENIES his request for a stay of execution. It should be noted, however, that even if it were a closer question whether Bryan had made a <em>prima facie </em>showing that he satisfies the requirements of \u00a7 2244(b)(2), which it is most certainly not, this court would still deny his request for a stay of execution. Bryan\u2019s last-minute filing, under the facts of this case, is a clear attempt to manipulate the federal courts into staying his execution without a real opportunity to delve into the merits of the case. <em>See Nelson, </em>at 2125 (\u201cA stay is an equitable remedy and equity must take into consideration the State\u2019s strong interest in proceeding with its judgment and attempts at manipulation. Thus, before granting a stay, a district court must consider not only the likelihood of success on the merits and the relative harms to the parties, but also the extent to which the inmate has delayed unnecessarily in bringing the claim. Given the State\u2019s significant interest in enforcing its criminal judgments, there is a strong equitable presumption against the grant of a stay where a claim could have been brought at such a time as to allow consideration of the merits without requiring entry of a stay.\u201d (quotations, citations, and alterations omitted)).</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b833-8\">. That is assuming, of course, that a petitioner can challenge his death sentence under the provisions of \u00a7 2244(b)(2)(B). <em>See LaFevers v. Gibson, </em>238 F.3d 1263, 1267 (10th Cir.2001) (noting that there is a circuit split on this question and declining to decide whether such challenges are cognizable under \u00a7 2244(b)(2)(B) because the claim would fail on the merits). As was true in <em>LaFevers, </em>this court need not resolve that difficult question because even assuming such a claim is available, it fails on the merits.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b834-6\">HENRY, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"ANy\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-7\">I vote to grant the stay. First I am not sure that \u00a7 1988 relief is unavailable. However, even if we must proceed under \u00a7 2244, I would still grant the stay. In <em>Nguyen v. Gibson, </em>162 F.3d 600 (10th Cir.1998) (per curiam), we held that this is a \u201csecond or successive petition\u201d under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244. I believe the evidence suggests the strong possibility of decline in Mr. Bryan\u2019s condition. Thus, this new evidence satisfies \u00a7 2244. I also believe Judge Briscoe\u2019s dissenting approach is correct and this case would meet that standard as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-8\">It is discouraging that counsel waited until this late date to present this claim, and it is also discouraging the prison psychologist is not aware of the standards of legal competency and presented inconsistent evaluations of Mr. Bryan. Given the magnitude of the interest at stake, I reluctantly conclude that a stay should be granted to determine Mr. Bryan\u2019s competency.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
