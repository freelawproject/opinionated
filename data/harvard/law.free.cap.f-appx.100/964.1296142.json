The district court entered summary judgment for defendants, and McQueen appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b994-30\">We have reviewed the briefs and pertinent portions of the record and have heard the arguments of counsel. We affirm, essentially for the reasons given by the district court. In summary, the statutory action is barred by limitations, and the district court committed no reversible error in finding immunity on the <em>Bivens </em>actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b995-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"965\">*965</page-number>The district court properly denied McQueen a waiver of fees regarding his FOIA request. If, however, McQueen is willing to pay the fees, he is not barred from pursuing a FOIA request.</p>\n<p id=\"b995-5\">It is time for this aged litigation to be put to bed. The judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b994-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set fort in 5th Cir. \u2022R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
