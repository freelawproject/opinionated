Kearns brought a negligence suit against ETS; Appellee Essex Source Realty Group (\u201cEssex\u201d), the lessor of ETS\u2019s office space; and Anton Kuppeck Landscaping (\u201cAnton\u201d), who provided landscaping for the building. Essex filed a third-party complaint against Appellant Vigilant Insurance Company (\u2018Vigilant\u201d), ETS\u2019s insurer, seeking coverage as an \u201cadditional insured\u201d for any damages owed by Essex to Kearns. Kearns\u2019s action was subsequently settled for $100,000, of which Essex paid $87,500 and Anton the remaining $12,500. Vigilant and Travelers Property Casualty Company (\u201cTravelers\u201d), Essex\u2019s insurer, split the $87,500 cost, each reserving the right to sue the other for full contribution. In October 2001, Vigilant and Travelers each filed a motion seeking to place responsibility for the full $87,500 cost with the other insurer, based on interpretation of their insurance policies\u2019 respective \u201cOther Insurance\u201d clauses. The District Court ruled that Vigilant\u2019s coverage had priority over Travelers\u2019, meaning that Vigilant was primarily liable for the $87,500 and Travelers\u2019 was only liable for any excess over Vigilant\u2019s coverage. Since Vigilant\u2019s coverage limit exceeded $87,500, the District Court\u2019s ruling effectively placed the burden for the entire $87,500 on Vigilant.</p>\n<p id=\"b906-15\">On appeal, Vigilant argues that Travelers\u2019 policy is ambiguous as to whether it has lower or equal priority relative to Vigilant\u2019s policy: specifically, the main text of the Travelers policy and a subsequent endorsement (# 1197) make no mention of policy priority, while a second endorsement (# 0192) explicitly states that any other insurer\u2019s policy will get priority over Travelers\u2019 policy. Essex (defended by Travelers) responds that the policy is not ambiguous because Endorsement # 0192 is the only provision targeting additional insureds in particular and is therefore con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"877\">*877</page-number>trolling. Upon examination of the Travelers policy, we agree with Essex that the policy is not ambiguous. Endorsement # 0192 is titled \u201cOTHER INSURANCE-ADDITIONAL INSUREDS,\u201d and explicitly dictates that the Travelers policy \u201cis excess over any of the other insurance ... [t]hat is valid and collectible insurance available to you if you are added as an additional insured under any other policy.\u201d App. at 325. This provision explicitly subordinates the Travelers policy to the Vigilant policy, as Essex is an additional insured under Vigilant\u2019s policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-6\">No other Travelers policy provision or endorsement contradicts Endorsement # 0192. It is true that two other sections of the policy discussing excess insurance do not cover prioritizations of policies, but that does not create an ambiguity. Rather, we read the Travelers policy as unambiguously stating that in the specific context of additional insureds, the Travelers policy will be subordinated to other additional insured coverage. The silence of the main text and Endorsement # 1197 as to policy prioritization does not undercut this clear statement, as neither of those provisions deals with additional insured coverage. Accordingly, we affirm the District Court\u2019s judgment.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b906-16\">. This case falls within the subject matter jurisdiction of the federal courts under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332(a), as there is complete diversity of citizenship among the parties and the amount in controversy exceeds $75,000.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b907-9\">. Because we find that the Travelers policy is unambiguous, the parties\u2019 argument over how to resolve any alleged ambiguity is rendered moot.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
