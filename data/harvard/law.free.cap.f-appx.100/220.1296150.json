Anderson seeks to appeal the district court\u2019s order denying relief on his motion filed under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 (2000). The district court referred the case to a magistrate judge pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636(b)(1)(b) (2000). The magistrate judge recommended that relief be denied and advised Anderson that the failure to file specific objections to this recommendation could waive appellate review of a district court order based on the recommendation. Despite this warning, Anderson failed to object in specific terms to the magistrate judge\u2019s recommendation.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-20\">The timely filing of specific objections to a magistrate judge\u2019s recommendation is necessary to preserve appellate review of the substance of that recommendation when the parties have been warned that failure to object will waive appellate review. <em>See Wright v. Collins, </em>766 F.2d 841, 845-46 (4th Cir.1985); <em>see also Thomas v. Arn, </em>474 U.S. 140, 106 S.Ct. 466, 88 L.Ed.2d 435 (1985). Anderson has waived appellate review by failing to file specific objections after receiving proper notice. Accordingly, we deny Anderson\u2019s motion for a certificate of appealability and dismiss the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-21\">We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-22\">\n<em>DISMISSED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
