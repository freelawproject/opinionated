We reverse and remand for dismissal in part, and we affirm in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-10\">(1) Morelli\u2019s challenge to the removal itself sought to attack the effect of his underlying felony conviction under California\u2019s domestic violence law. <em>See </em>Cal.Penal Code \u00a7 273.5; <em>see also </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(E)(i). But when the Board of Immigration Appeals affirmed the immigration judge\u2019s order of removal, Morelli could have appealed that decision to this court. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(1). He did not do so. Therefore, the district court should not have entertained the portion of his habeas corpus petition based upon removal. <em>See Arango Marquez v. INS, </em>346 F.3d 892, 897 (9th Cir.2003); <em>Taniguchi v. Schultz, </em>303 F.3d 950, 955-56 (9th Cir.2002); <em>Castro-Cortez v. INS, </em>239 F.3d 1037, 1047 (9th Cir.2001). For this purpose, it matters not whether we call the basis for dismissal of the habeas corpus petition jurisdictional<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> or prudential;<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the effect is the same.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The district court should have declined to proceed to the merits, and we will, therefore, reverse its merits determination and remand with directions to dismiss the removal claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-17\">(2) Morelli\u2019s habeas corpus petition also attacked the refusal to grant him voluntary departure. <em>See 8 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 1229c(b). Morelli had no right to pursue a direct appeal to this court on that issue. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229c(f) (\u201cNo court shall have jurisdiction over an appeal from denial of a request for an order of voluntary departure....\u201d); <em>Alvarez-Santos v. INS, </em>332 F.3d 1245, 1255 (9th Cir.2003). However, that section does not purport to affect 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241. As a result, it did not strip the district court of habeas corpus jurisdiction over Morelli\u2019s voluntary departure claim. <em>See INS v. St. Cyr, </em>533 U.S. 289, 310-13, 121 S.Ct. 2271, 2285-86, 150 L.Ed.2d 347 (2001) (Despite 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(C)\u2019s provision that \u201cno court shall have jurisdiction to review any final order of removal against\u201d certain aliens, habeas relief under \u00a7 2241 is not affected.); <em>Flores-Miramontes v. INS, </em>212 F.3d 1133, 1136-37 (9th Cir.2000) (same); <em>Magana v. Pizano v. INS, </em>200 F.3d 603, 607-09 (9th Cir.1999) (same as to similar transition section).</p>\n<p id=\"b651-18\">That said, we agree with the district court that the BIA did not err when it treated a crime of domestic violence against a cohabitant as a crime of moral turpitude.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> That precluded Morelli from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"622\">*622</page-number>showing good moral character within the meaning of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229c(b)(l)(B). <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(f)(3) (person included in 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(2)(A)(i)(I) does not have good moral character); 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(2)(A)(i)(I) (includes one who commits a crime of moral turpitude). Certainly, neither the California legislature nor Congress distinguished between spouses and cohabitants when expressing disdain for and legislating against those who inflict corporal injury. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(E); Cal.Penal Code \u00a7 273.5. Nor will we. The district court did not err.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-4\">AFFIRMED<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> as to voluntary departure, REVERSED as to removal, and REMANDED for dismissal of the removal claim.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b651-11\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b651-12\">. <em>See Taniguchi, </em>303 F.3d at 955.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b651-13\">. <em>See Arango Marquez, </em>346 F.3d at 897; <em>Castro-Cortez, </em>239 F.3d at 1047.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b651-14\">. Because Morelli filed the habeas corpus petition more than 30 days after the BIA decision, his claim could not be saved by dubbing the habeas corpus petition a misfiled appeal and transferring it here. <em>See Taniguchi, </em>303 F.3d at 956; <em>Haroutunian v. INS, </em>87 F.3d 374, 375 (9th Cir.1996); <em>cf. Gallo-Alvarez v.
