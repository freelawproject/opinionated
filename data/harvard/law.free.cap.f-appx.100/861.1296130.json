Kahn, <em>District Judge), </em>conditionally dismissing his 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988 action for failure to comply with Fed.R.Civ.P. 8, and the district court\u2019s subsequent entry of judgment against him. The district court had directed Applegate to file an amended complaint to prevent his action from being dismissed. Applegate did not file an amended complaint, but stated his belief that his original complaint, as filed, was sufficient to satisfy the requirements of Rule 8. Because we find that Applegate\u2019s original complaint was sufficient to \u201cenable the adverse party to answer and prepare for trial, allow the application of res judicata, and identify the nature of the case so it may be assigned the proper form of trial,\u201d <em>Simmons v. Abruzzo, </em>49 F.3d 83, 86 (2d Cir.1995) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted), we agree that his complaint was sufficient to satisfy Rule 8\u2019s \u201cextremely permissive\u201d standard. <em>See Wynder v. McMahon, </em>360 F.3d 73, 77 (2d Cir.2004). We therefore vacate the district court\u2019s dismissal of Applegate\u2019s action and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-10\">We note that, upon remand, the district court is authorized by Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(f) to strike those portions of the complaint that it believes to be redundant or immaterial. <em>See Salahuddin v. Cuomo, </em>861 F.2d 40, 42-43 (2d Cir.1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b892-11\">For the reasons set forth above, the judgment of the district court is hereby VACATED and the matter is REMANDED for further proceedings in accordance with this order.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
