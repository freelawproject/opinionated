The treating physician\u2019s opinion was properly discounted for being tainted by Hill\u2019s discredited subjective complaints, <em>Fair v. Bowen, </em>885 F.2d 597, 605 (9th Cir.1989), while the examining physician\u2019s opinion in question was a vocational opinion to which the ALJ owed no deference. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1527(e)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b695-6\">However, in denying Hill\u2019s claim at the fourth step of disability analysis the ALJ evidently failed to reference <em>Pinto v. Massanari, </em>249 F.3d 840 (9th Cir.2001). The ALJ\u2019s reliance on the vocational expert for findings on Hill\u2019s past relevant work was insufficient since the vocational expert only referenced the <em>Dictionary of Occupational Titles </em>(DOT) to describe the duties of Hill\u2019s past work. <em>Id, </em>at 846. The description Hill gave of her past duties did not directly conform to those jobs the vocational expert culled from the DOT, which is exactly the concern that <em>Pinto </em>addresses, particularly in relation to hand packaging jobs like Hill\u2019s. <em>Id. </em>Additionally, after finding that Hill was incapable of utilizing her hands on a repetitive basis, the ALJ found Hill capable of performing past relevant work that the DOT states requires constant use of the hands. <em>E.g., </em>Code No. 211.462-014 (Cashier-Checker). Because the findings of the ALJ are not supported by substantial evidence, we reverse the district court and remand this case to the ALJ for further consideration with reference to <em>Pinto.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b695-9\">REVERSED and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b695-7\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
