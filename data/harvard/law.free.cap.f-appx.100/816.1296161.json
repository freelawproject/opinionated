EBEL, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b846-28\">David L. Hilliard (\u201cPetitioner\u201d), a pro se prisoner, appeals the district court\u2019s denial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"817\">*817</page-number>of his \u201cPetition for Writ of Mandamus\u201d against state officials, as well as the denial of his \u201cMotion for Rehearing,\u201d which the court recharacterized as a motion for reconsideration under Rule 60(b).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> As described below, we lack jurisdiction over Petitioner\u2019s appeal of the initial order denying mandamus because his notice of appeal was untimely filed. However, we exercise jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 over Petitioner\u2019s appeal of the court\u2019s denial of Rule 60(b) reconsideration and AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-5\">BACKGROUND<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b847-6\">Petitioner was convicted in state court of conspiracy to commit robbery, robbery with a dangerous weapon, larceny of a motor vehicle, and assault and battery with the intent to kill. On appeal, the Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals overturned the conviction for assault and battery with intent to kill, but upheld the convictions on the remaining charges. <em>Hilliard v. State of Oklahoma, </em>Case No. F-92-1107 (Okla.Crim.App., Mar. 9, 1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b847-7\">Petitioner then unsuccessfully pursued post-conviction relief in state court. <em>State of Oklahoma v. Hilliard, </em>Case No. CRF-92-19 (Comanche Co. Dist. Ct., Feb. 22, 1996); <em>Hilliard v. State of Oklahoma, </em>Case No. PC-96-283 (Okla.Crim.App., July 23, 1996); <em>Hilliard v. State of Oklahoma, </em>Case No. 98-953 (Okla.Crim.App., Sept. 9, 1998); <em>Hilliard v. Comanche County, </em>Case No. MA-99-1166 (Okla.Crim.App., Oct. 29, 1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b847-8\">Petitioner also filed two \u00a7 2254 habeas petitions in the Western District of Oklahoma. The first was denied on grounds of prematurity because Petitioner was awaiting a decision on direct appeal in the state courts. <em>Hilliard v. Cody, </em>Case No. CIV-92-2313-L (WD.Okla., Dec. 4, 1992). The second habeas petition was denied due to procedural default. <em>Hilliard v. Kaiser, </em>Case No. CIV-96-1779-L (W.D.Okla., Jan. 16, 1997), appeal dismissed, <em>Hilliard v. Kaiser, </em>131 F.3d 151, Case No. 97-6163 (10th Cir., Dec. 9, 1997). Petitioner then requested authorization in the Tenth Circuit for the filing of a second or successive habeas petition, which was denied. <em>Hilliard v. Ray, </em>Case No. 01-6165 (10th Cir., June 6, 2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b847-12\">Before initiation of the current proceeding, Petitioner filed a petition for writ of mandamus in federal court, requesting a free copy of his state court record. The district court dismissed the claim based on a lack of authority to order production of documents or review state court decisions. <em>Hilliard v. Comanche County, </em>Case No. CIV-99-408-A (W.D.Okla., Sept. 8, 1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b847-13\">The instant action involves Petitioner\u2019s second petition for writ of mandamus filed in the Western District of Oklahoma. In this petition, Petitioner made three claims: (1) that the state courts were incorrect in their procedural rulings; (2) that his conviction for larceny of an automobile was duplicative of his conviction for robbery in the first degree; and (3) that his constitutional rights were violated by the state courts\u2019 denial of a free transcript. He sought reversal of all of the federal decisions on his habeas petitions and an order for the state court to send him a copy of the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"818\">*818</page-number>In denying this petition, the district court adopted the magistrate\u2019s report and recommendation, concluding that a federal writ of mandamus is unavailable against state actors and that federal district courts cannot undertake appellate review of state court decisions or federal habeas rulings. The magistrate had also declined to sua sponte recharacterize the petition for mandamus as a habeas petition under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 because it could disadvantage Petitioner in successive petitions or in his ability to appeal without a certificate of appealability.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-4\">Petitioner filed a \u201cMotion for Rehearing,\u201d which the district court properly re-characterized as a motion for reconsideration under Rule 60(b) since it had been filed more than 10 days after the judgment was entered. <em>See Van Skiver v. United States, </em>952 F.2d 1241, 1243 (10th Cir.1991). The district court denied Petitioner\u2019s motion because \u201ca party may not use a motion for reconsideration as a second opportunity to present its strongest case,\u201d and Petitioner had failed to \u201cdemonstrate a compelling reason for the court to reconsider or modify its ruling that this action should be dismissed for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.\u201d (Dec. 4 Ord. at 2.) Petitioner now appeals this denial of reconsideration and we AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b848-6\">A. Appeal from Order Dismissing Petitioner\u2019s Action</p>\n<p id=\"b848-7\">Although the district court entered its order dismissing the petition for writ of mandamus on October 31, 2003, Petitioner did not file his notice of appeal until December 15, 2003. This filing was well outside the 30-day time period under Rule 4(a)(1)(A), and was thus untimely. Petitioner\u2019s request for reconsideration, filed on November 25, 2003, did not toll the time to file his appeal from the judgment because it was not filed within 10 business days of the original judgment\u2019s entry (October 31, 2003). <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(4)(A); <em>Trotter v. Regents of the Univ. of N.M., </em>219 F.3d 1179, 1183 (10th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b848-9\">Because the time limits under Rule 4 are mandatory and jurisdictional, we are without jurisdiction to review the district court\u2019s decision on the merits in its October 31 order dismissing the action for failure to state a claim. <em>See Budinich v. Becton Dickinson &amp; Co., </em>486 U.S. 196, 203, 108 S.Ct. 1717, 100 L.Ed.2d 178 (1988); <em>see also Smith v. Barry, </em>502 U.S. 244, 245, 112 S.Ct. 678, 116 L.Ed.2d 678 (1992) (stating that appellate jurisdiction is \u201ccondition[ed] ... on the filing of a timely notice of appeal\u201d). Accordingly, we dismiss for lack of jurisdiction Petitioner\u2019s appeal of the district court\u2019s order dismissing the action, and note that nothing in this opinion should be construed as passing on the merits of this underlying judgment. We turn now to Petitioner\u2019s appeal of the district court\u2019s order denying reconsideration of its dismissal pursuant to Rule 60(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b848-10\">B. Appeal from Order Denying Rule 60(b) Reconsideration</p>\n<p id=\"b848-11\">We review the district court\u2019s denial of a Rule 60(b) motion for abuse of discretion. <em>The Servants of the Paraclete v. Does I-XVI, </em>204 F.3d 1005, 1009 (10th Cir.2000); <em>White v. American Airlines, Inc., </em>915 F.2d 1414, 1425 (10th Cir.1990). A district court would \u201cnecessarily abuse its discretion if it based its ruling on an erroneous view of the law or on a clearly erroneous assessment of the evidence.\u201d <em>FDIC v. United Pacific Ins. Co., </em>152 F.3d 1266, 1272 (10th Cir.1998) (quotation omitted). Although a district court has \u201csubstantial discretion\u201d to grant relief under Rule 60(b), such relief \u201cis extraordinary and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"819\">*819</page-number>may only be granted in exceptional circumstances.\u201d <em>Id. </em>A litigant \u201cshows exceptional circumstances by satisfying one or more of Rule 60(b)\u2019s six grounds for relief from judgment.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>Van Skiver v. United States, </em>952 F.2d 1241, 1243-44 (10th Cir.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b849-5\">However, Rule 60(b) is \u201cnot available to allow a party merely to reargue an issue previously addressed by the court when the reargument merely advances new arguments or supporting facts which were available for presentation at the time of the original argument.\u201d <em>United Pacific Ins. Co., </em>152 F.3d at 1272 (quoting <em>Cashner v. Freedom Stores, Inc., </em>98 F.3d 572, 577 (10th Cir.1996)). A district court does not abuse its discretion in denying a motion to reconsider where the petitioner simply \u201crevisits, albeit in somewhat different forms, the same issues already addressed and dismissed by the court.\u201d <em>Van Skiver, </em>952 F.2d at 1243. This is because a Rule 60(b) motion is \u201cnot intended to be a substitute for a direct appeal.\u201d <em>Servants, </em>204 F.3d at 1009.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-6\">In the instant case, Petitioner merely rehashed the same arguments in his motion for reconsideration as he had put forward in his petition for mandamus, claiming that the district court erred in refusing to issue a mandamus against state officials or to overturn federal court decisions denying habeas. Like the plaintiff in <em>Van Skiver, </em>Petitioner\u2019s simply \u201creiterated the original issues raised in [the] complaint and sought to challenge the legal correctness of the district court\u2019s judgment by arguing that the district court misapplied the law or misunderstood [his] position.\u201d <em>See Van Skiver, </em>952 F.2d at 1244. He did not alert the court to a change in the law or facts, present a compelling argument regarding \u201cfacially obvious\u201d legal error apparent from the record, <em>see id., </em>or persuade the court that manifest injustice had occurred. Nor does he make any such argument on appeal now, but instead opts for reiterating the merits arguments he made below. Petitioner has simply failed to demonstrate that \u201cexceptional circumstances\u201d warranted the court\u2019s discretionary granting of any relief under Rule 60(b). <em>See id. </em>at 1243.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-11\">Because Petitioner has \u201cfailed to show that the district judge made a definite, clear, or unmistakable error in denying the Rule 60(b) motion,\u201d we decline to find that the district court abused its discretion. <em>See Yapp v. Excel Corp., </em>186 F.3d 1222, 1232 (10th Cir.1999). We thus AFFIRM the district court\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-12\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b849-13\">For the foregoing reasons, we DISMISS for lack of jurisdiction Petitioner\u2019s appeal from the district court\u2019s order dismissing his petition for mandamus, and AFFIRM the court\u2019s order denying reconsideration under Rule 60(b).</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b846-16\"> After examining appellant's brief and the appellate record, this panel has determined unanimously that oral argument would not materially assist the determination of this appeal. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 34(a)(2) and 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument. This Order and Judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. The court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b847-9\">. Petitioner's Notice of Appeal simply states that he is appealing \"the adverse ruling entered in the above case number pertaining to Petitioners' Writ of Mandamus.\" Construing this language liberally in favor of this pro se petitioner, we conclude that Petitioner appeals both the order denying mandamus and the order denying reconsideration under Rule 60(b).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b847-16\">. The relevant facts are not disputed for purposes of this appeal and are taken from the Magistrate\u2019s Report and Recommendation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b849-7\">. Rule 60(b) provides in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b849-8\">On motion and upon such terms as are just, the court may relieve a party or a party\u2019s legal representative from a final judgment, order, or proceeding for the following reasons: (1) mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect; (2) newly discovered evidence which by due diligence could not have been discovered in time to move for a new trial under Rule 59(b); (3) fraud (whether heretofore denominated intrinsic</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b849-16\">or extrinsic), misrepresentation, or other misconduct of an adverse party; (4) the judgment is void; (5) the judgment has been satisfied, released, or discharged, or a prior judgment upon which it is based has been reversed or otherwise vacated, or it is no longer equitable that the judgment should have prospective application; or (6) any other reason justifying relief from the operation of the judgment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b849-17\">Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b849-14\">MURPHY, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"APM\">dissenting in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-15\">To the extent this court reviews the district court\u2019s order denying Hilliard\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"820\">*820</page-number>Rule 60(b) motion, I dissent. No matter how constructed, the district court lacked jurisdiction over Hilliard\u2019s Rule 60(b) motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-4\">In his mandamus petition, Hilliard sought relief from two respondents, an Oklahoma state court judge and the District Court of Comanche County, Oklahoma. Federal courts, however, have no jurisdiction to issue a writ of mandamus to a state judge or a state court. <em>Olson v. Hart, </em>965 F.2d 940, 942 (10th Cir.1992) (citing <em>Van Sickle v. Holloway, </em>791 F.2d 1431, 1436 n. 5 (10th Cir.1986)).</p>\n<p id=\"b850-5\">Because of the nature of the claims raised in Hilliard\u2019s mandamus petition, the district court could have recharacterized it as a \u00a7 2254 habeas petition. <em>Olson, </em>965 F.2d at 942. Hilliard would not have been prejudiced by such a recharacterization because he has already filed both an initial \u00a7 2254 petition and a request for authorization to file a second or successive habeas petition. <em>Hilliard v. Ray, </em>No. 01-6165 (10th Cir., June 6, 2001) (order); <em>Hilliard v. Kaiser, </em>No 97-6163, 1997 WL 758861 (10th Cir. Dec. 09, 1997) (unpublished disposition). Thus, the mandamus petition, so construed, is Hilliard\u2019s second attempt to file a second or successive \u00a7 2254 habeas petition. Successive habeas petitions cannot be filed in district court until the petitioner \u201cmove[s] in the appropriate court of appeals for an order authorizing the district court to consider the application.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(b)(3)(A). Hilliard did not request such authorization. Therefore, to the extent Hilliard\u2019s mandamus petition should have been recharacterized as a second or successive \u00a7 2254 habeas petition, the district court lacked jurisdiction to consider it.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-6\">In his Rule 60(b) motion, Hilliard requested the same relief as he sought in his mandamus petition. For the same reasons the district court lacked jurisdiction over Hilliard\u2019s mandamus petition, it also lacked jurisdiction over his Rule 60(b) motion. Accordingly, that motion should have been dismissed. I would vacate the district court\u2019s order denying Hilliard\u2019s Rule 60(b) motion and dismiss Hilliard\u2019s appeal from the district court\u2019s denial of that motion.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
