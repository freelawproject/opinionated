On appeal, counsel has filed a brief under <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), arguing that Dunbar should not have been sentenced as an armed career criminal because his prior robbery conviction was non-aggravated and thus not a predicate offense. Dunbar has filed a pro se supplemental brief, in which he argues that he was unable to take advantage of the plea agreement originally offered by the government because of problems with his former counsel, and that he possessed a firearm out of fear for his life.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-23\">We agree with the district court that Dunbar\u2019s robbery conviction was a violent felony for purposes of section 924(e), <em>see United States v. Leeper, </em>964 F.2d 751, 753 (8th Cir.1992), and Dunbar therefore qualified as an armed career criminal. Further, Dunbar does not have a remedy on direct appeal for the government\u2019s with<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>drawal of a plea agreement, <em>see United States v. Wessels, </em>12 F.3d 746, 752-53 (8th Cir.1993) (defendant not entitled to relief based on government\u2019s withdrawal of consent to agreement, because either party-may withdraw consent until bargain is accepted by court), and his guilty plea forecloses any claim that he possessed the firearm in self-defense, <em>see United States v. Beck, </em>250 F.3d 1163, 1166 (8th Cir.2001) (\u201cvalid guilty plea waives all nonjurisdictional defects\u201d) (quoting <em>Walker v. United States, </em>115 F.3d 603, 604 (8th Cir.1997)).</p>\n<p id=\"b625-5\">Following our independent review, <em>see Penson v. Ohio, </em>488 U.S. 75, 109 S.Ct. 346, 102 L.Ed.2d 300 (1988), we find no nonfrivolous issues. Accordingly, we affirm the sentence.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b624-16\">.
