We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b972-17\">\n<em>DISMISSED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b972-12\"> For the purpose of this appeal, we assume that the date appearing on the notice of appeal is the earliest date it could have been properly delivered to prison officials for mailing to the court. <em>See </em>Fed.
