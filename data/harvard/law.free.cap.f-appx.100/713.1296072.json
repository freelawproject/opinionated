In addition, two subscribers brought related state law claims alleging Comcast charged them for a service not supplied. The district court granted summary judgment in favor of Comcast on the federal claims, holding the information in the con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"715\">*715</page-number>verter boxes was not personally identifiable information and dismissing the state law claims without prejudice. Exercising jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-5\">Background</p>\n<p id=\"b745-6\">Martin Pruitt, Lucretia Pruitt, David Elgin, Daniel Llewellyn and Cheryl Llewellyn (\u201cAppellants\u201d) are past or present subscribers of Comcast\u2019s digital cable service. To receive such service, subscribers must have a special converter box installed and attached to their telephone line. The converter boxes, manufactured by Motorola, transmit and store (1) pay-per-view purchase information, (2) system diagnostic information and (3) settop bugging information. Each converter box contains a code displayed in hexadecimal format indicating the date of a pay-per-view purchase and a source identifier for the pay-per-view channel. The converter box stores a maximum of sixty-four purchases. When total purchases exceed that number, the newest purchase information overwrites the oldest purchase. The converter box also contains a code (again displayed in hexadecimal format) signifying the total number of purchases and payments generated through that particular box. Individual subscriber information is not contained within the converter box, but an identifying number known as a \u201cunit address\u201d allows Comcast to match the subscriber\u2019s purchases to its billing system. The billing system contains the name and address of the household member responsible for payment.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-7\">Appellants filed suit claiming Comcast violated the Cable Act by (1) storing personally identifiable information (47 U.S.C. \u00a7 551(e)) and (2) storing that information longer than necessary (47 U.S.C. \u00a7 551(a)). After reviewing cross motions for summary judgment, the district court held the coded information in the converter boxes was not \u201cpersonally identifiable,\u201d and therefore declined to consider whether Comcast retained that information longer than necessary. Finding the federal questions resolved, the district court dismissed the Pruitts\u2019 state law claims without prejudice. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-9\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b745-10\">1. Cable Act Claims</p>\n<p id=\"b745-11\">We review summary judgment <em>de novo </em>applying the same legal standard used by the district court. <em>Scofield v. TeleCable of Overland Park, </em>973 F.2d 874, 878 (10th Cir.1992).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b745-12\">Summary judgment is appropriate \u201cif the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact.\u201d ... [We] draw all inferences in favor of the party opposing summary judgment, [recognizing] credibility determinations, the weighing of the evidence, and the drawing of legitimate inferences from the facts are jury functions, not those of a judge.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b745-13\"><em>Jones v. Barnhart, </em>349 F.3d 1260, 1265 (10th Cir.2003) (quoting Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c)). This Court\u2019s role \u201cis simply to determine whether the evidence proffered by plaintiff would be sufficient, if believed by the ultimate fact finder, to sustain [the] claim.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1265-66.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-15\">\u201cIn 1984, Congress enacted the Cable Act to establish national policy and guidelines for the cable television industry.\u201d <em>Scofield, </em>973 F.2d at 876. The Cable Act creates a nationwide standard for the protection of subscriber privacy by regulating the collection, use, and disclosure by cable operators of personally identifiable information regarding cable subscribers. In particular, 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 551 \u201cestablishes a self-contained and privately enforceable scheme for the protection of cable sub<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"716\">*716</page-number>scriber privacy.\u201d <em>Id. </em>This section responds to \u201cCongress\u2019 observation that: [c]able systems, particularly those with a \u2018two-way\u2019 capability, have an enormous capacity to collect and store personally identifiable information about each cable subscriber.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting H.R.Rep. No. 934, 98th Cong., 2d Sess. 29 (1984)). \u201cSubscriber records from interactive systems,\u201d Congress noted, \u201ccan reveal details about bank transactions, shopping habits, political contributions, viewing habits and other significant personal decisions.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b746-4\">Although \u00a7 551 regulates cable company practices involving personally identifiable information, exceptions are provided where such information is necessary to render service to the subscriber, \u00a7 551(b)(2)(A), or to detect unauthorized reception of cable communications. 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 551(b)(2)(B). Even so, such subscriber information must be destroyed when it is no longer necessary for the purpose for which it was collected. 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 551(e). Further, \u00a7 551(a) of the Cable Act \u201cestablishes a set of subscriber notice requirements designed to inform subscribers of ... the operator\u2019s information practices that affect subscriber privacy....\u201d <em>Scofield, </em>973 F.2d at 876.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-5\">The heart of this dispute is whether the information stored within Comcast\u2019s converter boxes is personally identifiable information. \u201cWhile the term is not affirmatively defined by the Act, \u00a7 551(a)(2)\u201d defines what it is not. <em>Id. </em>It provides: \u201cfor purposes of this section, the term \u2018personally identifiable information\u2019 does not include any record of aggregate data which does not identify particular persons.\u201d 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 551(a)(2). \u201cIn addition, legislative history [suggests] that personally identifiable information would include specific information about the subscriber, or a list of names and addresses on which the subscriber is included....\u201d <em>Scofield, </em>973 F.2d at 876 (quotation and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b746-7\">Appellants concede the information in the converter boxes does not contain the name, address or any information regarding the customer. However, they maintain the unit address enables Comcast to identify a customer\u2019s viewing habits by connecting the coded information with its billing or management system. Because the information in any given converter box is not eradicated when it is recycled to another customer, they conclude the converter boxes contain personally identifiable information which may never be purged.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-8\">In granting summary judgment to Com-cast, the district court distinguished the information in the converter boxes from that contained in the billing system. It noted the converter box code \u2014 without more \u2014 provides nothing but a series of numbers. We agree. Without the information in the billing or management system one cannot connect the unit address with a specific customer; without the billing information, even Comcast would be unable to identify which individual household was associated with the raw data in the converter box. Consequently, it is the billing system that holds the key to obtaining personally identifiable information, not the converter box. Appellants made no claim in their briefs or at oral argument that the collection of information in the billing system violates the Cable Act. Moreover, Comcast\u2019s privacy notice to subscribers clearly states the retention policies related to information in the billing system:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b746-9\">Accounting and billing records are retained for ten years for tax and accounting purposes or until the relevant income tax years for which the document was created has been closed for income tax purposes and/or all appeals have been exhausted. Routine paper records <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"717\">*717</page-number>necessary to render or conduct legitimate business activities ... are kept in accordance with the local cable company\u2019s voluntarily adopted document retention program. Paper records such as work orders and records of technical maintenance and service ... are retained for three years. Subject to applicable law, records relating to involuntary disconnects are kept indefinitely by us or [our] affiliates ... to facilitate collection and evaluation of creditworthiness and are updated as new information is added.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b747-5\">(Appellants\u2019 App. at 95.) Absent any allegation that the retention of data in the billing or management systems violates the Cable Act, we agree with the district court that the converter boxes contain no personally identifiable information and Comcast\u2019s privacy notice to subscribers adequately states its billing information policies. Because we conclude the converter boxes contain no personally identifiable information, we need not consider whether Comcast retained such information longer than otherwise necessary. <em>See </em>47 U.S.C. \u00a7 551(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b747-6\">2. Dismissal of State Law Claims</p>\n<p id=\"b747-7\">With regard to Pruitts\u2019 assertion that the district court erroneously dismissed their state law contract claims, we find it to be without merit. When the district court correctly dismisses a plaintiffs federal law claims, we review its decision to refuse to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over that plaintiffs state law claims for an abuse of discretion. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1367(c)(8); <em>Gold v. Local 7 United Food &amp; Commercial Workers Union, </em>159 F.3d 1307, 1310 (10th Cir.1998), <em>overruled on other grounds by Styskal v. Weld County Comm\u2019rs., </em>365 F.3d 855 (10th Cir. 2004). While</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b747-8\">the federal courts\u2019 original jurisdiction over federal questions carries with it jurisdiction over state law claims that derive from a common nucleus of operative fact, ... district courts are statutorily authorized to decline supplemental jurisdiction over a state law claim if</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b747-10\">(1) the claim raises a novel or complex issue of State law,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b747-11\">(2) the claim substantially predominates over the claim or claims over which the district court has original jurisdiction,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b747-12\">(3) the district court has dismissed all claims over which it has original jurisdiction, or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b747-13\">(4) in exceptional circumstances, there are other compelling reasons for declining jurisdiction.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b747-14\"><em>Gold, </em>159 F.3d at 1310 (quotations and citations omitted); <em>see </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1367(a). The district court\u2019s actions were clearly authorized under \u00a7 1367(c)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b747-15\">For the foregoing reasons, the district court\u2019s judgment in favor of Comcast is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b744-11\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent except under the doctrines of law of the case, <em>res judicata </em>and collateral estoppel.

R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b744-21\">.
