According Hurt the benefit of Fed. R.App. P. 4(c)(1), the notice of appeal was filed no earlier than April 2, 2004, one day late. Because Hurt failed to file a timely notice of appeal or to obtain an extension or reopening of the appeal period, we dismiss the appeal. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b974-5\">\n<em>DISMISSED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
