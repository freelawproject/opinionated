Dulaney pleaded guilty to being a felon in possession of a firearm, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 922(g)(1) and 924(a)(2), and to knowingly possessing a stolen firearm, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 922(j) and 924(a)(2). The trial judge added four offense levels under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(5) for using the firearm in connection with another felony, namely the assault on Rainey. On appeal, Dulaney challenges only the assignment of those sentencing levels, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-14\">We review the district court\u2019s application of the Sentencing Guidelines to the facts for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Jackson-Randolph, </em>282 F.3d 369, 390 (6th Cir.2002). A district court abuses its discretion when it relies on clearly erroneous findings of fact, or when it improperly applies the law, or uses an erroneous legal standard. <em>Hamad v. Woodcrest Condo. Ass\u2019n, </em>328 F.3d 224, 237 (6th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b442-15\">U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(5) requires adding four offense levels to a sentence for criminal possession or trafficking of firearms, when \u201cthe defendant used or possessed any firearm or ammunition in connection with another felony offense.\u201d Dulaney argues that indiscriminate application of this enhancement does not comport with the general policy that a four-level enhancement be applied only to punish \u201cegregious\u201d criminal behavior. <em>United States v. Sanders, </em>162 F.3d 396, 401 (6th Cir.1998). He urges that we recognize that <em>Sanders </em>and <em>United States v. McDonald, </em>165 F.3d 1032 (6th Cir.1999), have created a rule that no single episode of criminal behavior will justify the imposition of the \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(5) enhancement. He construes the word \u201canother\u201d in \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(5) as indicating that the defendant must have used his weaponry in two separate felony offenses besides the offense with which he is charged.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-16\">Dulaney\u2019s reliance on <em>Sanders </em>and <em>McDonald </em>is misplaced. These cases hold that when a felon steals a firearm, \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(5) does not allow the district court to double-count that single act of theft as encompassing both possession and \u201canother felony.\u201d In contrast, the district court punished Dulaney separately for two completely separate acts: coming into ille<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>gal possession of a firearm, and later illegally using the firearm. <em>United States v. Hurst, </em>228 F.3d 751, 762-63 (6th Cir.2000) <em>(Sanders </em>does not bar the application of \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(5) to defendant who stole handgun and then used it in a second burglary).</p>\n<p id=\"b443-5\">Because Dulaney\u2019s challenge to the trial court\u2019s application of the Sentencing Guidelines is without merit, we AFFIRM the judgment of the district court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
