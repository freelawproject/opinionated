Chavful contends that (1) the evidence was insufficient to support his Hobbs Act convictions, (2) the district court allowed the indictment to be constructively amended, and (3) the district court abused its discretion by excluding evidence of his prior state court acquittal, and by admitting a letter indicating his involvement with a gang, expert testimony explaining the letter, and a handwriting expert\u2019s testimony regarding Chavful\u2019s attempt to disguise his writing. We AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-10\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b258-11\">On August 2, 1994, an airport shuttle driver was shot and killed during an attempted robbery in San Antonio. Julius Steen, a known gang member, was arrested on August 15 for a different shooting, and admitted during questioning that he took part in the shuttle driver\u2019s shooting as well. Steen became an informant for the state, testifying that he, along with Donte Chavful and Dwayne Dillard, as members of the same gang, conspired to rob the airport shuttle driver. Steen testified that Dillard drove the car, Chavful shot the driver, and Steen rode in the back seat. Texas charged Chavful with murder, but he was acquitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-16\">The United States charged Chavful with conspiring and attempting to obstruct, delay and affect commerce by robbery of the airport shuttle in violation of the Hobbs Act. The Hobbs Act indictments at issue alleged that Donte Chavful:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Az\">did knowingly and willfully conspire, combine, confederate, and agree together with others known to the Grand Jury to in any way and degree obstruct, delay, and affect commerce and the movement of any article and commodity in commerce, by robbery of the driver of a Star Shuttle airport van \u2014 an instrumentality of commerce, who was then waiting beside the Crockett Hotel in San Antonio, Texas, all in violation of Title 18, United States Code, Section 1951.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b258-17\">The jury found Chavful guilty of the Hobbs Act charges and of using or carrying a firearm during a crime of violence.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-18\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b258-19\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b258-20\">Chavful first asserts that there was insufficient evidence to convict him of conspiring and attempting to obstruct, delay, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>or affect commerce by robbery. He claims that because the indictment alleged that he obstructed commerce by robbery of \u201ca van \u2014 an instrumentality of commerce,\u201d the government was specifically required to prove that the airport shuttle was an instrumentality of interstate commerce. Chavful urges that the government failed to do so, and the district court allowed him to be convicted based on any effect on interstate commerce was erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-5\">In reviewing a challenge to the sufficiency of evidence, we must determine \u201cwhether, after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b259-6\">The two essential elements of a Hobbs Act violation are (1) a robbery, extortion, or attempted robbery or extortion, and (2) a resulting interference with commerce.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Commerce is defined broadly, reaching to its constitutional limit.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> If an indictment charges nonessential facts, the government is not required to prove them to obtain and sustain a conviction.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> \u201c[T]he Government need not prove all facts charged in the indictment as long as it proves other facts charged in the indictment which do satisfy the essential elements of the crime.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b259-7\">Given the essential elements of the Hobbs Act violation and the applicable caselaw, Chavful\u2019s argument fails. The Hobbs Act counts only required the government to prove an attempt and a conspiracy to affect commerce by robbery. The indictment charged that Chavful \u201cdid knowingly conspire, combine, confederate, and agree together with others ... to in any way and degree obstruct, delay, and affect commerce and the movement of any article and commodity in commerce, by robbery of the driver of a Star Shuttle airport van \u2014 an instrumentality of commerce.\u201d Because an effect on an instrumentality of commerce is not an element of a \u00a7 1951(a) violation, the charge in the indictment that the airport shuttle was an instrumentality of commerce was surplus-age.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The government\u2019s evidence demonstrating that various aspects of commerce were affected by the robbery \u2014 a contention that Chavful does not dispute on appeal \u2014 was sufficient to allow the jury to find all essential elements of the Hobbs Act violations beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-16\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b259-17\">Chavful next asserts that the indictment was constructively amended. He reads the indictment as charging him with affecting only one particular type of commerce \u2014 the airport shuttle. He urges that despite this limitation, the jury was allowed to convict him upon finding that the robbery affected any type of interstate commerce. Chavful relies on the rule established by <em>Stirone v. United States: </em>\u201cwhen only one particular kind of commerce is charged to have been burdened!,] a conviction must rest on that charge and not another.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b260-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>Once a grand jury returns an indictment, its charges may only be broadened by the grand jury itself.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> A corollary of this rule is that \u201ca court cannot permit a defendant to be tried on charges that are not made in the indictment against him.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> \u201cA constructive amendment to the indictment occurs when the jury is permitted to convict the defendant on a factual basis that effectively modifies an essential element of the offense charged in the indictment.\u201d <footnotemark>11</footnotemark> An indictment may be constructively amended by evidence offered or by jury instructions.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> However, \u201c[n]ot every variance between the indictment\u2019s allegations and proof at trial engenders a constructive amendment. For example, no constructive amendment arises \u2018where the evidence proves facts different from those alleged in the indictment, but does not modify an essential element of the charged offense.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> If a constructive amendment occurs, the conviction must generally be reversed.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b260-4\">To find a constructive amendment here, the evidence adduced at trial or the jury instructions must have permitted the jury to convict Chavful on a factual basis that effectively modified the essential elements of the Hobbs Act charges.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Contrary to Chavful\u2019s assertion, the indictment did not charge that only one particular kind of commerce was affected; instead, it charged that Chavful did [conspire and attempt to] \u201cin any way and degree obstruct, delay, and affect commerce and the movement of any article or commodity in</p>\n<p id=\"b260-12\">commerce, by robbery of the driver of a Star Shuttle airport van \u2014 an instrumentality of commerce.\u201d Unlike the indictment in <em>Stirone, </em>which charged that the defendant\u2019s extortion affected one specific commodity in commerce, Chavful\u2019s indictment clearly charged that commerce in general was affected by his robbery of the airport shuttle. This indictment limits the government to proving an effect on commerce as a result of the robbery of the shuttle, and the evidence and jury instructions stayed true to this limitation. Accordingly, the latter part of the <em>Stirone </em>rule applies: \u201cunder an indictment drawn in general terms[,] a conviction might rest upon a showing that commerce of one kind or another had been burdened.\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Neither the evidence of the robbery\u2019s affect on various aspects of interstate commerce nor the jury instructions constructively amended the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-13\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b260-14\">Finally, Chavful argues that the judge erroneously admitted into evidence (1) a letter Chavful wrote that demonstrates his affiliation with a gang and refers to the people involved in the conspiracy, (2) an expert\u2019s testimony explaining elements of the letter, and (3) a handwriting expert\u2019s testimony that Chavful disguised his handwriting in samples given to the FBI. Chavful asserts that this evidence was irrelevant, and assuming relevancy, was unfairly prejudicial. Chavful also asserts that the Judge erred in refusing to admit evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>of his prior state acquittal.. Considering the charges, Chavful\u2019s assertions at trial, and the nature of the evidence admitted, there is no reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-5\">We review evidentiary rulings under a deferential standard.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Reversal is warranted only when the admission constituted an abuse of discretion.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Evidence is relevant if it has \u201cany tendency to make the existence of any fact that is of consequence to the determination of the action more probable or less probable than it would be without the evidence.\u201d<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Otherwise relevant evidence \u201cmay be excluded if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, or misleading the jury.\u201d<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> The trial judge has broad discretion over determinations of relevance under Federal Rule of Evidence 401 and unfair prejudice or confusion under Federal Rule of Evidence 403.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b261-6\">The gang letter was probative of Chavful\u2019s association with other members of the conspiracy. It also served to rebut Chavful\u2019s attempt to distance himself from the gang and the other members of the conspiracy. Chavful asserts that the letter\u2019s admission was unfairly prejudicial because the letter includes violent and obscene language, racial slurs, and threats. While the language of the letter was prejudicial to Chavful, it was not unfairly prejudicial. Chavful does not dispute that he wrote the letter, and the letter clearly serves to associate him with the gang and other members of the conspiracy. Finally, the district court gave extensive limiting instructions to the jury, explaining that gang membership was not inherently bad and that gang membership was not an issue in the case. The highly probative value of the evidence, coupled with the judge\u2019s limiting instructions, belies Chavful\u2019s assertion that the evidence\u2019s relevance is substantially outweighed by its unfair prejudice. Under these circumstances, the court did not abuse its discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-12\">Second, Chavful asserts that the gang expert\u2019s testimony was irrelevant because the letter itself was irrelevant. This argument fails for the reasons above. Furthermore, the letter included various slang terms that would be meaningless without the assistance of an expert\u2019s explanation. The judge did not abuse his discretion by admitting the testimony; its relevance was not substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-13\">Third, Chavful contests the admission of the handwriting expert\u2019s testimony regarding his attempt to disguise his handwriting. He claims that because there was no dispute that he wrote the letter, the expert\u2019s testimony was irrelevant and was included only to inflame the jury. However, under our caselaw, a jury may consider attempted disguise as demonstrating a defendant\u2019s consciousness of guilt.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> Chavful does not respond to this authority. Even assuming that the district court abused its discretion by admitting the testimony, any error would be harmless. The government presented a significant amount of evidence demonstrating Chavful\u2019s involvement in the robbery and his association with the coconspirators.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>Finally, Chavful argues that the court erred in excluding evidence of his prior acquittal. Based on the following evidence and events put before the jury, he asserts that his presumption of innocence was improperly eroded: (1) two jurors saw him in handcuffs; (2) during his testimony, Steen referred to an event that occurred \u201cafter Chavful\u2019s trial,\u201d which Chavful views as implying that he was tried and convicted in state court; (3) the person who obtained the gang letter testified that she got it from an inmate who had received it from Chavful, which Chavful views as implying his incarceration from a conviction; and (4) a sheriff testified that Chavful had a visitation list at the prison.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-4\">His argument is without merit. It is axiomatic that a criminal defendant has a constitutional right to a presumption of innocence.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> The Court has left trial judges to determine what evidence and procedures may erode the presumption \u201cbased on reason, principle, and common human <em>experience.\u201d</em><footnotemark><em>24</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Courts have found the presumption impermissibly eroded by requiring a defendant to wear prison attire throughout the trial.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> However, the nature of the evidence at issue here did not rebut the presumption of innocence.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-5\">Contrary to Chavful\u2019s assertion, the court did not abuse its discretion by refusing to admit evidence of Chavful\u2019s acquittal because the evidence at issue did not rebut the presumption of innocence. As we explained in <em>United States v. De La Rosa, </em>\u201cas a general matter, a trial court does not abuse its discretion in excluding evidence of a prior acquittal on a related charge.\u201d<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> We noted that evidence of acquittal is irrelevant to the defendant\u2019s innocence, is unexempted hearsay, and any relevance may be outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice and jury confusion.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> Chavful does not cite any authority explaining why <em>De La Rosa\u2019s </em>general rule should not control. Moreover, other evidence illustrates that any burden on Chavful\u2019s presumption of innocence must have been neutralized. Evidence before the jury clearly showed that Chavful must have been acquitted in state court. Namely, there was evidence that he was visiting people outside of jail between the crime at issue and the federal trial; the only implication is that if they knew a state trial occurred, Chavful must have been acquitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-11\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b262-12\">For these reasons, Chavful\u2019s convictions are AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b258-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
