Pertuit. Louisiana Dock contends that the ALJ\u2019s decision is not supported by substantial evidence and that the ALJ erred in finding Louisiana Dock to be Pertuit\u2019s last responsible employer. We disagree and AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b290-8\">The case revolves around the claims of Clifton A. Pertuit, a crane operator, outside machinist, and propeller repairman who began working for Louisiana Dock in 1977. In 1989, he injured his back while lifting a propeller cone to center a wheel. He underwent surgery to repair a herniated disc and returned to work in 1990 with medical restrictions that limited the work he could perform. Nonetheless, he occasionally experienced problems with his back, and he was under the care of Dr. Gregg Bendrick. The record indicates, moreover, that beginning in January 2000, his condition began to worsen.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-12\">On May 15, 2000, Louisiana Dock sold its facility to Respondent National Maintenance and Repair. Pertuit remained with the shipyard as an employee of National Maintenance, with similar duties and work assignments. Just under two months after the sale, Pertuit obtained a letter from Dr. Bendrick stating that Pertuit was unfit for work because of his deteriorating back. Shortly thereafter, Pertuit filed a claim for compensation. Louisiana Dock and National Maintenance each contended that the other was responsible. Pertuit brought an action against both parties. The ALJ found that Pertuit\u2019s disabling back condition had resulted from the natural progression of the injury he suffered in 1989 and concluded that Pertuit\u2019s work at National Maintenance had not aggravated his condition. Accordingly, the ALJ concluded that Louisiana Dock was responsible for his compensation and medical benefits. On appeal, the Benefits Review Board affirmed the ALJ\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-13\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b290-14\">The scope of our review of BRB decisions is narrow. \u201cWe review a decision of the Benefit Review Board under the same standard as it reviews the decision of the ALJ: Whether the decision is supported by substantial evidence and is in accordance with the law.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We \u201cmay not substitute our judgment for that of the ALJ, nor reweigh or reappraise the evidence, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>but may only determine whether evidence exists to support the ALJ\u2019s findings.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Moreover, \u201cthe ALJ\u2019s decision need not constitute the sole inference that can be drawn from the facts.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b291-5\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b291-6\">Louisiana Dock\u2019s primary contention is that the ALJ\u2019s finding that Pertuit\u2019s condition is the natural progression of his 1989 injury is not supported by substantial evidence. After reviewing the ALJ\u2019s opinion and the evidence upon which it is based, we cannot agree. The ALJ carefully reviewed the testimony of Pertuit and his treating physician, Dr. Bendrick, as well as the testimony offered by Dr. Appelbaum, a physician who examined Pertuit in 2001. In particular, Pertuit testified that he did not aggravate his back condition during the course of his employment with National Maintenance and that he suffered no new accident there. He also indicated that the discomfort his back injury caused him did not increase during his time with National Maintenance. Dr. Bendrick indicated that Pertuit\u2019s back condition deteriorated significantly in March 2000 and posited that his disability was the result of the natural progression of his original back injury. Dr. Appelbaum testified that Pertuit denied suffering any additional trauma or accident during his work with National Maintenance. Given this record, the ALJ\u2019s conclusion that Pertuit\u2019s disability resulted from the natural progression of his original back injury is supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-7\">We recognize, as did the ALJ and the BRB, that there is evidence in the record that could support Louisiana Dock\u2019s claim that Pertuit aggravated his injury while working at National Maintenance. The ALJ specifically considered this evidence, evaluated the testimony and medical opinions, assessed the credibility of the testifying witnesses, and concluded that Pertuit did not aggravate his injury at National Maintenance. As noted, we \u201cmay not substitute our judgment for that of the ALJ, nor reweigh or reappraise the evidence, but may only determine whether evidence exists to support the ALJ\u2019s findings.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The ALJ\u2019s findings are not irrational and are supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-14\">Louisiana Dock next argues that the ALJ made an error of law by finding Louisiana Dock to be the last responsible employer after concluding that Pertuit aggravated his condition at National Maintenance. Louisiana Dock\u2019s argument is unpersuasive for the simple reason that the ALJ did not find that Pertuit\u2019s back condition was aggravated during his employment with National Maintenance. As noted, there was evidence presented that could have supported such a finding, but the ALJ rejected this evidence and concluded that Pertuit did not aggravate his injury, suffer a new incident, or sustain a new injury while working for National Maintenance.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-15\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b291-16\">Because there was sufficient evidence supporting the ALJ\u2019s finding, we AFFIRM the judgment of the Benefits Review Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-17\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b290-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
