Vinokur challenges the immigration judge\u2019s finding that his asylum application was untimely and that he failed to demonstrate a change in circumstances or extraordinary circumstances excusing the late filing. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(2)(B) (2000); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.4(a)(4) (2003). We conclude that we lack jurisdiction to review this claim pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(3). <em>See Castellano-Chacon v. INS, </em>341 F.3d 533, 544 (6th Cir.2003); <em>Tarrawally v. Ashcroft, </em>338 F.3d 180, 185-86 (3d Cir.2003); <em>Tsevegmid v. Ashcroft, </em>336 F.3d 1231, 1235 (10th Cir.2003); <em>Fahim v. United States Attorney Gen., </em>278 F.3d 1216, 1217-18 (11th Cir.2002); <em>Hakeem v. INS, </em>273 F.3d 812, 815 (9th Cir. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"914\">*914</page-number>2001); <em>Ismailov v. Reno, </em>263 F.3d 851, 854-55 (8th Cir.2001). Given this jurisdictional bar, we cannot review the underlying merits of Vinokur\u2019s asylum claim. Accordingly, we deny Vinokur\u2019s petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b944-4\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
