(\u201cFondElec\u201d) appeal from a judgment entered by the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York (Stanton, /.), pursuant to a jury verdict in favor of CSC Consulting, Inc. (\u201cCSC\u201d). Familiarity is assumed as to the facts, the procedural context, and the specification of appellate issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-5\">1. Trial judges have \u201cconsiderable discretion in determining how to respond to communications indicating that the jury is experiencing confusion.\u201d <em>United States v. Parker, </em>903 F.2d 91, 101 (2d Cir.1990). The district court is at liberty to choose language it deems appropriate to instruct the jury so long as its charge \u201cadequately states the law.\u201d <em>United States v. Alkins, </em>925 F.2d 541, 550 (2d Cir.1991). The supplemental instruction given here was within the bounds of discretion; it was both legally accurate and responsive to the jury\u2019s question.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-6\">2. The decision to admit expert testimony is left to the trial judge\u2019s discretion, and will not be set aside unless \u201cmanifestly erroneous.\u201d <em>McCullock v. H.B. Fuller Co., </em>61 F.3d 1038, 1042 (2d Cir.1995). Appellants\u2019 proffer at trial as to the substance of the excluded testimony was insufficient and vague. <em>See </em>Fed. R.Evid. 103(a)(2) (\u201c[ejrror may not be predicated upon a ruling which ... excludes evidence\u201d unless \u201cthe substance of the evidence was made known to the court by offer\u201d). Moreover, experts may not testify to the question of where liability lies in a particular case. <em>See United States v. Duncan, </em>42 F.3d 97, 101 (2d Cir.1994) (\u201cWhen an expert undertakes to tell the jury what result to reach, this does not aid the jury in making a decision, but rather attempts to substitute the expert\u2019s judgment for the jury\u2019s.\u201d). The district court acted within its discretion in excluding the expert testimony in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-8\">3. Judgment as a matter of law may be granted \u201conly when there is such a complete absence of evidence supporting the verdict that the jury\u2019s findings could only have been the result of sheer surmise and conjecture.\u201d <em>Samuels v. Air Transp. Local 504, </em>992 F.2d 12, 14 (2d Cir.1993) (citation omitted). Sufficient evidence was presented at trial for a rational trier of fact to find that ThinkChain\u2019s veil should be pierced <em>(see, e.g., </em>Appx. Vol. 1 at 193; Vol. 1 at 197; Vol. 1 at 217; Vol. 2 at 606; Tr. 12/12/02 at 208) and that ThinkChain fraudulently conveyed assets <em>(see, e.g., </em>Appx. Vol. 2 at 966; Tr. 1/3/03 at 297-99; Tr. 1/3/03 at 304).</p>\n<p id=\"b37-9\">Any recovery for tortious interference with contract would be duplicative of damages already awarded for breach of contract; the district court recognized this overlap, and awarded no separate damages for the tortious interference <em>of </em>contract verdict entered by the jury. Accordingly, we do not consider the sufficiency of evidence supporting the claim for tortious interference.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-10\">4. As to the cross-appeal, CSC consciously decided to forgo overtime payments in recognition of ThinkChain\u2019s financial condition. No overtime was charged on the two invoices that had already been paid, and no overtime charges were submitted on the invoices that remained unpaid at the time of trial. Sufficient evidence was adduced at trial to support the jury\u2019s finding that CSC waived payment for overtime on the unpaid invoices, and the district court\u2019s denial of CSC\u2019s motion for a judgment as a matter of law was not in error. <em>See Phillips v. Bowen, </em>278 F.3d 103, 108 (2d Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b38-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>For the reasons set forth above, the judgment of the district court is hereby AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
