The BIA summarily affirmed the decision of the Immigration Judge (\u201cIJ\u201d), denying <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>Yang\u2019s application for asylum and withholding of removal, and denying him relief under Article 3 of the United Nations Convention Against Torture (\u201cTorture Convention\u201d), and directed Yang\u2019s removal from the United States. The IJ found Yang\u2019s testimony not credible because it was vague and contained implausibilities and inconsistencies regarding material elements of his claim. The IJ further determined that Yang had failed to demonstrate that he had been subject to past persecution, possessed a well-founded fear of future persecution, or that he would \u201cmore likely than not\u201d be subjected to torture if he were returned to China.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-5\">Where the BIA summarily affirms the IJ\u2019s decision and adopts the IJ\u2019s reasoning in doing so, we review the decision of the IJ directly. <em>Secaida-Rosales v. INS, </em>331 F.3d 297, 305 (2d Cir.2003). We generally treat an IJ\u2019s determination of credibility as a factual finding subject to the substantial evidence standard. <em>Id. </em>at 307; <em>see also Alvarado-Carillo v. INS, </em>251 F.3d 44, 49 (2d Cir.2001) (describing substantial evidence as \u201cmore than a mere scintilla. It means such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u201d) (internal quotation marks omitted). A lack of credibility stems from \u201cinconsistent statements, contradictory evidence, and inherently improbable testimony.\u201d <em>Qiu v. Ashcroft, </em>329 F.3d 140, 152 n. 6 (2d Cir.2003) (internal quotation marks omitted). Unlike immaterial inconsistencies, discrepancies and omissions that concern integral grounds of the asylum claim afford a sufficient basis for an adverse credibility determination. <em>See Gao v. Ashcroft, </em>299 F.3d 266, 272 (3d Cir.2002). We will reverse a decision of the IJ only where \u201cno reasonable fact-finder could have failed to find the past persecution or fear of future persecution necessary to sustain the petitioner\u2019s burden.\u201d <em>Diallo v. INS, </em>232 F.3d 279, 287 (2d Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b91-7\">Article 3 of the United Nations Convention Against Torture was implemented by the Foreign Affairs Reform and Restructuring Act of 1988, Pub.L. No. 105-277, div. G, Title XXII, \u00a7 2242, 112 Stat. 2681-822 (Oct. 21, 1998). <em>Wang v. Ashcroft, </em>320 F.3d 130, 133 (2d Cir.2003). Article 3 precludes the United States from returning an alien to a country where he more likely than not would be tortured by, or with the acquiescence of, government officials acting under color of law. <em>Id. </em>at 133-34; 8 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 208.16(c), 208-17(a), 208.18(a) (2002). \u201cTorture is an extreme form of cruel and inhuman treatment.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.18(a)(2). \u201cIn order to constitute torture, an act must be specifically intended to inflict severe physical or mental pain or suffering.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 208.18(a)(5). \u201cAn alien is not entitled to [relief under the Torture Convention] unless he can prove that, upon being returned to his country of origin, he is more likely than not to suffer intentionally-inflicted cruel and inhuman treatment that either (1) is not lawfully sanctioned by that country or (2) is lawfully sanctioned by that country, but defeats the object and purpose of [the Torture Convention].\u201d <em>Wang, </em>320 F.3d at 134.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-8\">In this case there is substantial relevant evidence to support the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination. The IJ disbelieved Yang\u2019s story about his participation in the student demonstration in Fuzhou which precipitated his departure from China because it was predicated on a timeline of events that was implausible. According to Yang\u2019s testimony, he spoke with the brother of a friend in the morning of May 14, 1989 upon the brother\u2019s return from a demonstration in Fuzhou, twenty to thirty miles away. Yang then allegedly accompanied this friend immediately back <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>to Fuzhou in order to participate in a demonstration occurring at eleven a.m. that same morning. The IJ also found the story to lack credibility because \u201cnone of these facts are contained in [Yang\u2019s] statement attached to his application for asylum.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b92-4\">The IJ further found several inconsistencies in Yang\u2019s testimony. Yang testified that he had stayed home from school on May 14, 1989 in order to help his sick father, but also testified that he left home early in the morning of May 14 in order to participate in the demonstration in Fuzhou without informing either of his parents. Yang also testified that the police never inquired about his participation in the student demonstrations, but that later, when he was in hiding, his parents informed him that the police had come looking for him on several occasions. Finally, Yang submitted an identification card in support of his asylum application that was issued in December 1989; however, Yang testified that he left the Fujian province in January 1989 and never returned. When confronted with this inconsistency, Yang testified vaguely that the identification card was issued to a \u201cfamily member\u201d whom he failed to identify. The IJ\u2019s determination that \u201cthe respondent\u2019s testimony was halting and hesitant and he appeared to be making up facts as he went along [and therefore] failed to testify credibly\u201d is supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-5\">There is also substantial evidence to support the IJ\u2019s determination that Yang failed to demonstrate past persecution or a well-founded fear of future persecution. Yang testified that he participated minimally in one student demonstration that occurred in China over fourteen years ago. He testified at one point that the police had never pursued him for participating in the student demonstration, and at another point, that an unspecified family member informed him that the police were looking for him. He provided no corroboration for the latter vague testimony. There is no evidence in the record that Yang\u2019s decision to leave home after being dismissed from school was compelled by government action. In addition to these insufficiencies in Yang\u2019s testimony, the INS provided documentary evidence, including the Department of State\u2019s <em>Country Reports on Human Rights Practice </em>\u2014 2000 on China and a detailed analysis of the 1989 democracy movement in the Fujian province, written by two Chinese-speaking American professors. These reports undermine Yang\u2019s claims of persecution. The analysis written by the American professors, in particular, portrays the treatment of student dissidents in Fujian province as quite distinct from the treatment of student demonstrators in Beijing, noting that even after the Chinese Government imposed martial law in Beijing, \u201cFujian officials were reluctant to take tough measures against demonstrators[.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b92-7\">For similar reasons, the IJ\u2019s determination that Yang had failed to demonstrate that it was \u201cmore likely than not\u201d that he would be subjected to torture if he were returned to China, was supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-8\">For the foregoing reasons, we are compelled to conclude that the BIA properly dismissed Yang\u2019s appeal. We are disturbed, however, by the less-than-zealous performance of Yang\u2019s counsel at the asylum hearing. Counsel failed to appear at Mr. Yang\u2019s July 19, 2000 hearing, was late and unprepared for the January 24, 2001 hearing, admitted at that hearing that he had \u201chad no chance to meet with [his] client or prepare,\u201d and, called Mr. Yang as his sole witness at the August 21, 2001 hearing, but agreed to forego direct examination and allow the INS lawyer to exercise complete control over the proceedings. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>Despite these failures, appellate counsel (who did not represent Yang below) failed to raise a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel before the BIA or this Court. Thus, as such claims must be heard by the BIA in the first instance, we have no basis, in fact or law, to render any conclusion as to the ineffectiveness of Yang\u2019s counsel. <em>See Arango-Aradondo v. INS, </em>13 F.3d 610, 614 (2d Cir.1994). The petition for review is hereby DENIED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
