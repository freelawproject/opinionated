Rev.Code \u00a7\u00a7 71.09.010-902. Turay\u2019s direct challenge to his confinement was denied by the Washington Supreme Court in <em>In re Detention of Turay, </em>139 Wash.2d 379, 986 P.2d 790 (Wash.1999). He petitioned the district court for habeas relief, was denied, and now appeals to this court for relief on five grounds. As the parties are familiar with the facts, procedural history, and arguments, we will not recount them here. We affirm the district court\u2019s denial of Turay\u2019s habeas petition, under the deferential standards for review established under AEDPA, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d). We briefly address each ground of Turay\u2019s petition in the order he presents them.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-8\">The right to self-representation at civil commitment proceedings has not been clearly established by the U.S. Supreme Court. The decision of the Washington Supreme Court here was not contrary to clearly established federal law. In addition, the state court noted the equivocal nature of Turay\u2019s requests for self-representation. <em>Detention of Turay, </em>986 P.2d at 799-800. In light of Turay\u2019s alternative requests for particular attorneys to represent him, we cannot say that the state court\u2019s finding was an unreasonable determination of the facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-9\">The Washington Supreme Court ruled that the evidence of conditions that Turay sought to present was irrelevant to the jury\u2019s decision whether to commit him as an SVP. <em>Id. </em>at 803-04. That determination of relevance was not unreasonable. At the commitment trial, the jury\u2019s role was to determine whether Turay was an SVP, Wash. Rev.Code \u00a7 71.09.060(1), and if so, whether it was in his own and the public\u2019s interest that he be completely confined, or confined to a \u201cless-restrictive alternative.\u201d <em>See Detention of Turay, </em>986 P.2d at 803-04; <em>see also In re Brooks, </em>145 Wash.2d 275, 36 P.3d 1034, 1044 (Wash. 2001). On the issue of whether Turay is an SVP, <em>where </em>he would serve his commitment is irrelevant. As for the placement decision, the primary issue to be resolved is whether an SVP should be totally or less-restrietively confined, rather than whether he will receive better treatment at one location or another.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-12\">Turay asserts a due process violation where the trial court permitted the government to present evidence about the details of his prior crimes, including testimony from the victims. The purpose of an SVP proceeding is \u201cto assess the mental state of the alleged SVP, the nature of his or her sexual deviancy, and the likelihood that he or she will commit a crime involving sexual violence in the future.\u201d <em>Detention of Turay, </em>986 P.2d at 802. These factors cannot be properly assessed by merely accepting Turay\u2019s stipulation to the fact of the prior convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-13\">The Supreme Court has clearly established that, in civil commitment proceedings, \u201cdue process requires the state to justify confinement by proof more substantial than a mere preponderance of the evidence.\u201d <em>Addington v. Texas, </em>441 U.S. 418, 427, 99 S.Ct. 1804, 60 L.Ed.2d 323 (1979). The Court did not mandate the use of the \u201cclear and convincing\u201d standard, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number>but found that standard constitutionally adequate. <em>Id. </em>at 433. Washington law provides for a \u201cbeyond a reasonable doubt\u201d standard, which satisfies the federal constitutional requirement. Turay argues, however, that the instructions given the jury in his case combined the phrase \u201cbeyond a reasonable doubt\u201d and the word \u201clikely\u201d in a way that could have confused the jury such that in practice they could have applied a \u201cpreponderance\u201d standard that would not satisfy the federal constitutional requirement. The instructions were not literally inaccurate, and they may have satisfied due process by \u201cinformfing] the factfinder that the proof must be greater than the preponderance-of-the-evidence standard applicable to other categories of civil cases.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b638-4\">Even if the instructions given in Turay\u2019s case were inadequate, however, Turay is entitled to habeas relief only if he can establish that the error had \u201csubstantial and injurious effect or influence in determining the jury\u2019s verdict.\u201d <em>California v. Roy, </em>519 U.S. 2, 4-5, 117 S.Ct. 337, 136 L.Ed.2d 266 (1996) (per curiam) (quoting <em>Brecht v. Abrahamson, </em>507 U.S. 619, 637, 113 S.Ct. 1710, 123 L.Ed.2d 353 (1993)). In view of the extensive evidence of his criminal history and the minimal likelihood that the jury would have reached any different result with a different instruction, Turay is not entitled to habeas relief on this ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-5\">As to the claim that the Special Corrections Center provides constitutionally inadequate treatment and therefore his confinement violates due process and the Eighth Amendment, Turay would have us look not at the statute on its face, but as applied to him, in determining whether it is punitive. When another Washington SVP challenged the same statute, the Supreme Court specifically rejected such \u201cas applied\u201d arguments in the double jeopardy and ex post facto contexts. <em>Seling v. Young, </em>531 U.S. 250, 263, 121 S.Ct. 727, 148 L.Ed.2d 734 (2001). For the same reasons given by the Court there, \u201cas applied\u201d Eighth Amendment and due process challenges must also fail when brought as habeas grounds. Instead, as recognized by the Supreme Court in <em>Seling v. Young, id. </em>at 258, the Washington Supreme Court in <em>Detention of Turay, </em>986 P.2d at 812, and the district court here, Turay\u2019s remedy for the allegedly unconstitutional conditions of his confinement is a \u00a7 1983 action, not total release from custody.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>See Badea v. Cox, </em>931 F.2d 573, 574 (9th Cir.1991) (\u201cHabeas corpus proceedings are the proper mechanism for a prisoner to challenge the legality or duration of confinement. A civil rights action, in contrast, is the proper method of challenging conditions of confinement.\u201d) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b638-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b637-10\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b638-6\">.
