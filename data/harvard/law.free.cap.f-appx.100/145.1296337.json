Dewitt contends that the district court plainly erred in assessing two criminal history points under <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 4Al.l(d) (2002). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-6\">Pursuant to USSG \u00a7 4Al.l(d), two criminal history points \u201care added if the defendant committed any part of the instant offense (i.e., any relevant conduct) while under any criminal justice sentence, including probation.... \u201d USSG \u00a7 4Al.l(d), comment, (n.4). Dewitt asserts that he did not commit the instant offense while subject to another criminal justice sentence because he had completed his twelvemonth probationary sentence for a battery conviction on April 7, 2001, and his relevant conduct relating to the instant offense began, at the earliest, on July 30, 2001\u2014 the date on which co-defendant Emmanuel Donte Scott sold crack to a confidential informant in a controlled buy. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-7\">The district court determined at sentencing that Dewitt\u2019s relevant conduct included Scott\u2019s sales of crack to Oliver Tobias Scott during four or five months in 2000. <em>See </em>USSG \u00a7 1B1.3; <em>United States v. Kennedy, </em>32 F.3d 876, 890 (4th Cir.1994) (\u201cThis broad concept of \u2018relevant conduct\u2019 includes activities that occurred before the date identified by the indictment as the starting date of the offense.\u201d); <em>United States v. Harris, </em>932 F.2d 1529, 1538 (5th Cir.1991) (holding that \u201cpre-indictment activities may properly be considered when determining the applicability of section 4Al.l(d) or (e)\u201d). Dewitt\u2019s probation began on April 7, 2000, and ended on April 7, 2001. Because Dewitt\u2019s commission of the instant offense, including relevant conduct, occurred while he was on probation, we find no plain error in the district court\u2019s assessment of two criminal history points under USSG \u00a7 4Al.l(d). <em>See United States v. Osborne, </em>345 F.3d 281, 284 (4th Cir.2003) (discussing plain error standard of review); <em>see United States v. Vital, </em>68 F.3d 114, 119 (5th Cir.1995) (stating that questions of fact that could have been resolved by the district court had objection been made at sentencing can never constitute plain error).</p>\n<p id=\"b176-9\">Accordingly, we affirm Dewitt\u2019s sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-10\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
