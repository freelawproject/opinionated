Finding no clear error in the bankruptcy court\u2019s factual determinations concerning Killingsworth\u2019s entitlement to a discharge, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-33\">The Bankruptcy Code provides that a discharge of debt shall be granted under Chapter 7 unless, among other things, the debtor knowingly and fraudulently made a false oath, which is material to the bank<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>ruptcy estate. 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 727(a)(4)(A) (1994); <em>Williamson v. Fireman\u2019s Fund Ins. Co., </em>828 F.2d 249, 251 (4th Cir.1987). Whether a debtor knowingly and fraudulently made a false oath within the meaning of \u00a7 727(a)(4)(A) is a question of fact, which will not be overturned unless found to be clearly erroneous. <em>See </em>Bankr.R. Bankr.8013; <em>Williamson, </em>828 F.2d at 251.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-5\">We have reviewed the record and the parties\u2019 briefs and find no clear error in the bankruptcy court\u2019s determination that Killingsworth\u2019s failure to disclose the transfer of assets and income to his wife constituted a false oath within the meaning of \u00a7 727(a)(4)(A). Accordingly, we affirm for the reasons stated by the district court. <em>See Killingsworth v. Killingsworth (In re Killingsworth), </em>No. CA-02-412-3; BK-01-31338 (W.D.N.C. Sept. 15, 2003). We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-6\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
