Lucas under the Black Lung Benefits Act (\u201cthe Act\u201d), 30 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 901-45 (2000). Because the ALJ properly analyzed the relevant evidence, adequately explained his resolution of conflicting evidence, and reached a decision supported by substantial evidence in the record, we deny the petition for review and affirm the award of benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b924-12\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b924-13\">Jimmy D. Lucas worked in the coal mines for twenty-eight years before retiring in 1997 due to an ankle injury. On November 25, 1997, he filed an application for black lung benefits with the Office of Workers\u2019 Compensation (\u201cOWCP\u201d). After denying his claim, the OWCP referred Lucas\u2019s case to ALJ Robert J. Lesnick for a hearing and adjudication. On November 3, 2000, the ALJ issued an opinion awarding Lucas benefits. Williams appealed, and the BRB vacated the ALJ\u2019s finding pertaining to the existence of pneumoconiosis based on the medical opinion evidence and his finding with regard to disability causation. The BRB remanded Lucas\u2019s case to the ALJ with specific instructions to explain further his resolution of the conflicting record evidence. On remand, the ALJ further articulated his reasoning, and again awarded benefits. This time the BRB upheld the award on appeal. Williams timely petitioned for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b924-14\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b924-15\">Our standard for reviewing an award of black lung benefits is well-established:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b925-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"895\">*895</page-number>We review claims for benefits under the Act to determine whether substantial evidence supports the ALJ\u2019s findings of fact. Substantial evidence is more than a mere scintilla. It is such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion. In determining whether substantial evidence supports the ALJ\u2019s factual determinations, we must first address whether all of the relevant evidence has been analyzed and whether the ALJ has sufficiently explained his rationale in crediting certain evidence. We review the ALJ\u2019s and the Board\u2019s conclusions of law de novo to determine whether they are rational and consistent with applicable law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b925-5\"><em>Milburn Colliery Co. v. Hicks, </em>138 F.3d 524, 528 (4th Cir.1998) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b925-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-7\">On appeal, Williams challenges three aspects of the ALJ\u2019s opinion: (1) the asserted failure to resolve conflicting accounts of Lucas\u2019s smoking history; (2) the finding that Lucas suffered from pneumoconiosis; and (3) the conclusion that pneumoconiosis was a substantial contributing cause of Lucas\u2019s totally disabling respiratory condition.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> With respect to all three of these issues, however, Williams puts forth the same basic arguments; namely, that the ALJ failed to consider all relevant evidence and adequately explain how he resolved the conflicting evidence in the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-8\">The Administrative Procedures Act (\u201cAPA\u201d) requires an ALJ to include in his opinion \u201cfindings and conclusions, and the reasons and basis therefore, on all the material issues of fact, law, or discretion presented on the record.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 557(c)(3)(A) (2000); <em>see also Lane Hollow Coal Co. v. OWCP, </em>137 F.3d 799, 802-03 (4th Cir.1998). The APA does not, however, require the ALJ to regurgitate the record nor does it demand perfection. Rather, the primary purpose of the APA\u2019s \u201cduty of explanation\u201d is to help the ALJ reach the correct result, and \u201cits secondary purpose is to allow us to discharge our own duty to review the decision.\u201d <em>Lane Hollow, </em>137 F.3d at 803. So, \u201c[i]f we understand what the ALJ did and why he did it, we, and the APA, are satisfied.\u201d <em>Id. </em>With these principles in mind, we turn to Williams\u2019 assertions of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-11\">First, Williams argues that the ALJ failed to resolve the conflicting accounts of Lucas\u2019s smoking history and make a \u201cspecific finding\u201d as to the extent of this history. To the contrary, however, the ALJ\u2019s finding as to the extent of Lucas\u2019s smoking history is evident from the opinion \u2014 the ALJ clearly relied on the eighteen-pack year smoking history recorded by Dr. Rasmussen based on Lucas\u2019s self-report. In doing so, the ALJ also acknowledged and considered other conflicting accounts provided in the record. In his first opinion, the ALJ implicitly rejected the lower estimates of Lucas\u2019s smoking history, as reported by Lucas at the evidentiary hearing and to Dr. Zalvidar. And on remand, the ALJ discredited the higher estimates of Lucas\u2019s smoking history put forth by Drs. Castle, Zalvidar, Jarboe, and Morgan be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"896\">*896</page-number>cause these experts rejected Lucas\u2019s self-reports and instead relied primarily on the results of a carboxyhemoglobin test \u2014 a test that even Dr. Zalvidar acknowledged was \u201cnot very accurate\u201d in predicting a patient\u2019s smoking <em>history. </em>Although the ALJ did not expressly discuss each and every alternative account of Lucas\u2019s smoking history, we are satisfied that the opinion contains adequate information to accommodate a thorough review, <em>see See v. Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., </em>36 F.3d 375, 384 (4th Cir.1994), and that the ALJ\u2019s reliance on an eighteen-pack year history is supported by substantial evidence in the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b926-4\">Williams next contends that the ALJ failed to adequately resolve the conflicting record evidence as to whether Lucas suffered from pneumoconiosis.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> On remand, the ALJ first examined the x-ray and CT scan evidence. Of the thirty x-ray readings, six were positive and twenty-four were negative for pneumoconiosis. The ALJ discounted several of the negative x-ray readings because the qualifications of the readers were unknown and because of concerns about the poor film quality of one of the x-rays. Based on the conflicting evidence still remaining, the ALJ concluded that the radiological evidence was \u201csuggestive,\u201d but not conclusive of pneumoconiosis.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b926-10\">The ALJ then continued on to consider the conflicting medical opinions. In the ALJ\u2019s first opinion, he thoroughly summarized the opinions of each of the nine doctors.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Those opinions split into two camps \u2014 some doctors opined that Lucas had pneumoconiosis and was totally disabled as a result of exposure to coal mine dust and cigarette smoking, and others concluded that Lucas did not have pneumoconiosis and his total disabling condition was solely the result of his smoking history.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> On remand, the ALJ briefly reviewed these opinions again, and ultimately chose to credit the former group of experts, and in particular Dr. Rasmussen. The ALJ clearly articulated the reasons why he discredited the opinions of those experts who did not diagnose pneumoconiosis \u2014 primarily because they improperly relied on the inaccurate carboxyhemoglobin test to inflate Lucas\u2019s smoking history and refused to consider the possible additive effect of smoking and coal dust in making their ultimate conclusions. The ALJ also stated his reasons for crediting Dr. Rasmussen, finding that in addition to being Lucas\u2019s treating physician, his opinion was also the \u201cbest reasoned and documented because it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"897\">*897</page-number>was most consistent with [Lucas\u2019s] complaints of shortness of breath, his history of smoking, coal mine employment, along with qualifying results on the pulmonary function studies that showed irreversibility.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b927-5\">The ALJ examined all of the evidence together, in accord with our directive in <em>Island Creek Coal Co. v. Compton, </em>211 F.3d 203 (4th Cir.2000), before ultimately concluding that Lucas had established the existence of pneumoconiosis by a preponderance of the evidence. The ALJ has exclusive power to make credibility determinations and resolve inconsistencies in the evidence; thus, we will not disturb his conclusion because it is clearly supported by substantial evidence in the record and is not contrary to law. <em>See Grizzle v. Pickands Mather &amp; Co./Chisolm Mines, </em>994 F.2d 1093, 1096 (4th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b927-6\">Finally, Lucas asserts that the ALJ did not consider all relevant evidence and failed to resolve conflicting evidence when ascertaining the cause of Lucas\u2019s totally disabling respiratory impairment. Once again, the expert opinions were divided into two groups \u2014 those opining that Lucas\u2019s disability was caused by both cigarette smoking and coal mine dust, and that coal mine dust was a significant contributing cause, and those concluding that cigarette smoking was the <em>only </em>cause. The ALJ again found the former opinion, particularly as articulated by Dr. Rasmussen, to be the most persuasive, and thus concluded that pneumoconiosis was a substantially contributing cause of Lucas\u2019s totally disabling condition.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b927-8\">Although the ALJ\u2019s discussion of disability causation was admittedly brief, we have repeatedly recognized that the ALJ\u2019s \u201cduty of explanation is not intended to be a mandate for administrative verbosity or pedantry. If a reviewing court can discern what the ALJ did and why he did it, the duty of explanation is satisfied.\u201d <em>Piney Mountain Coal Co. v. Mays, </em>176 F.3d 753, 762 n. 10 (4th Cir.1999) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Here, we have no difficulty discerning the ALJ\u2019s reasoning; indeed, the ALJ expressly incorporated .\u201cthe reasons outlined\u201d in the remainder of his opinion. Looking to the opinion as a whole, we are satisfied that the ALJ discussed all relevant evidence. Moreover, as noted above, the ALJ also adequately explained why he discredited the opinions of Williams\u2019 experts \u2014 because, <em>inter alia, </em>they refused to consider the possibility that coal dust, in addition to cigarette smoking, caused Lucas\u2019s impairment. This is more than sufficient to satisfy the ALJ\u2019s duty of explanation, and the ALJ\u2019s conclusion that pneumoconiosis was a substantially contributing cause of Lucas\u2019s disabling condition is supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b927-9\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b927-10\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is denied and the decision awarding benefits is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b927-11\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b925-9\">. To obtain benefits under the Act, a claimant must establish by a preponderance of the evidence that: \"(1) he has pneumoconiosis; (2) the pneumoconiosis arose out of his coal mine employment; (3) he has a totally disabling respiratory or pulmonary condition; and (4) pneumoconiosis is a [substantially] contributing cause of his total respiratory disability.\u201d <em>Island Creek Coal Co. v. Compton, </em>211 F.3d 203, 207 (4th Cir.2000); <em>see also </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 718.202-204 (2003). Williams does not dispute that Lucas has established the second and third elements.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b926-5\">. Pursuant to 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 718.202(a), a claimant can prove the existence of pneumoconiosis through four different categories of evidence; the only two relevant here are x-ray evidence, \u00a7 718.202(a)(1), and reasoned medical opinion evidence, \u00a7 718.202(a)(4).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b926-6\">. Williams argues that the ALJ must make a conclusive finding as to whether the x-ray evidence <em>alone </em>establishes pneumoconiosis, and that characterizing the x-rays as \"suggestive\u201d is insufficient. But, contrary to Williams\u2019 assertions, the ALJ is actually required to \u201cweigh the x-ray evidence with the physicians' opinions\u201d <em>before </em>concluding whether a claimant has established the presence of pneumoconiosis. <em>See Compton, </em>211 F.3d at 211 (requiring the ALJ to weigh all of the relevant evidence under \u00a7 718.202(a) together).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b926-12\">. In his remand opinion, the ALJ expressly incorporated \"all of the evidence which was previously discussed\u201d in his first opinion, \"[e]xcept as otherwise vacated by the Board.\u201d In its first order the BRB only vacated two of the ALJ\u2019s <em>findings: </em>(1) the \"Section 718.202(a)(4) (2000) finding,\u201d and (2) the \"finding regarding the cause of claimant\u2019s total respiratory disability.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b926-15\">. Of the nine expert opinions, only Dr. Gobunsuy did not reach any conclusion as to whether Lucas was totally disabled, and thus did not discuss the cause of his total disability-</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b927-7\">. To be totally disabled due to pneumoconiosis under the revised regulations, pneumoconiosis must be a \"substantially contributing cause\u201d of the miner's totally disabling impairment, 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 718.204(c)(1) (2001); whereas prior to this amendment, we only required that pneumoconiosis be a \"contributing cause\u201d of the disabling condition, <em>see Robinson v. Pickands Mather &amp; Co./Leslie Coal Co., </em>914 F.2d 35, 38 (4th Cir.1990). The ALJ found that total disability had been established under both standards.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
