He appeals the district court\u2019s denial of his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 petition. We previously granted a certificate of appealability (COA) on two issues: \u201c1) whether trial counsel rendered ineffective assistance in failing to assert at trial an insanity defense on Decker\u2019s behalf; and 2) whether the district court erred in summarily rejecting Decker\u2019s six additional ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claims as waived due to inadequate briefing by appointed counsel, and, in the alternative, on the ground that no evidence existed in the record in support of the claims.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b297-16\">Decker raises a number of arguments beyond the scope of the issues on which we granted COA. We do not reach these issues because he has not sought an expansion of the COA. <em>See United States v. Kimler, </em>150 F.3d 429, 430-31 (5th Cir.1998); <em>Lackey v. Johnson, </em>116 F.3d 149, 151-52 (5th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b297-17\">Under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d), we may not grant habeas relief on an issue that was adjudicated on the merits in a state court proceeding unless that decision was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States or unless it was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the state court proceeding. To establish that his attorney performed ineffectively, Decker must show both that his counsel\u2019s performance was deficient and that the deficient performance prejudiced his defense. <em>See Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 687, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984). Decker contends that his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>counsel provided ineffective assistance by not obtaining psychiatric or neuropsychological reports and pursuing an insanity defense at trial. Counsel requested and obtained a report from a clinical psychologist which, although cursory, indicated that Decker was sane at the time of the offense. Counsel questioned the psychologist, reviewed Decker\u2019s records, spoke with his family, and attempted to confer with Decker regarding the offense. According to counsel, she opted not to pursue an insanity defense at least in part because it would have required admission of the offense conduct, an admission that Decker had not made. Counsel elected instead to put the state to its burden of proof in light of perceived gaps in the state\u2019s evidence. Given the competency jury\u2019s negative reaction to Decker during the competency proceedings, counsel also sought to mitigate any potential punishment.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-4\">\u201cA conscious and informed decision on trial tactics and strategy cannot be the basis for constitutionally ineffective assistance of counsel unless it is so ill chosen that it permeates the entire trial with obvious unfairness.\u201d <em>Crane v. Johnson, </em>178 F.3d 309, 314 (5th Cir.1999) (citation and internal quotation omitted). Under the instant circumstances, Decker has not shown that the state court\u2019s decision was contrary to or involved an unreasonable application of <em>Strickland. See Schaetzle v. Cockrell, </em>343 F.3d 440, 443 (5th Cir.2003), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 124 S.Ct. 1156, 157 L.Ed.2d 1050 (2004); <em>Green v. Johnson, </em>116 F.3d 1115, 1122-23 (5th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b298-6\">Decker did not raise the issue of the district court\u2019s denial of his remaining ineffective assistance claims on procedural grounds in his initial brief. Even if these claims had been properly raised, however, see <em>Cousin v. Trans Union Corp., </em>246 F.3d 359, 373 n. 22 (5th Cir.2001), Decker\u2019s argument would be without merit, as he contends only that he should not be blamed for his counsel\u2019s inadequate briefing. <em>See Coleman v. Thompson, </em>501 U.S. 722, 752-54, 111 S.Ct. 2546, 115 L.Ed.2d 640 (1991); <em>Miller v. Johnson, </em>200 F.3d 274, 282 (5th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b298-8\">For these reasons, the district court\u2019s denial of habeas corpus relief under 2254 is</p>\n<p id=\"b298-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b297-14\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
