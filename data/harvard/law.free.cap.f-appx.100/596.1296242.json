For reversal, Larson argues that the district court erred in finding res judicata barred his claim that the government breached its plea agreement with him in a tax-evasion prosecution against him, <em>see Larson v. United States, </em>835 F.2d 169, 171 (8th Cir.1987), ce<em>rt. denied, </em>486 U.S. 1056, 108 S.Ct. 2824, 100 L.Ed.2d 925 (1988), by later seizing money from two of his bank accounts, <em>see Larson v. United States, </em>274 F.3d 643, 644 (1st Cir.2001). Although the government ultimately returned the seized money, <em>see id., </em>Larson sought \u201clost imputed interest costs.\u201d For the reasons discussed below, we affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-21\">Specifically, we agree with the district court that Larson\u2019s action is barred by res judicata, as his breach-of-contract claim was denied by the Court of Federal Claims, and the First Circuit Court of Appeals found that he was not entitled to recover interest on the seized money. <em>See id. </em>at 645-48; <em>Lundquist v. Rice Mem\u2019l Hosp., </em>238 F.3d 975, 977 (8th Cir.2001) (per curiam) (elements of res judicata). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>To the extent Larson seeks relief under the Fourth Amendment unrelated to the recovery of lost interest, such relief is not appropriately sought by motion for a writ of mandamus in his criminal tax-evasion case. Finally, we reject Larson\u2019s argument that he is entitled to costs and fees, because he is not the prevailing party in this litigation. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2412; Fed. R.Civ.P. 54(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b627-5\">Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b626-14\">. The Honorable David S. Doty, United States District Judge for the District of Minnesota.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
