In his habeas petition, Smith-Stewart stated that he was convicted of various crimes in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana, and sentenced to 181 months\u2019 imprisonment. He alleged that the Louisiana district court had improperly denied his requests for appointment of counsel, forcing him to proceed <em>pro se </em>at trial. According to petitioner, his convictions were affirmed by the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, and his petition for a writ of certiorari was denied by the United States Supreme Court. Smith-Stewart then apparently filed a motion to vacate his convictions pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255, which was denied, as was his application for a certificate of appealability. Finally, Smith-Stewart stated that he subsequently filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York, which that court treated as a \u00a7 2255 motion and transferred to the Fifth Circuit, which allegedly denied petitioner leave to pursue a second or successive \u00a7 2255 motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-5\">Section 2255 provides that a petition filed under its provisions \u201cshall not be entertained if it appears that the applicant has failed to apply for relief, by motion, to the court which sentenced him, or that such court has denied him relief, unless it also appears that the remedy by motion is inadequate or ineffective to test the legality of his detention.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. The district court held that Smith-Stewart failed to establish the inadequacy or ineffectiveness of \u00a7 2255 to address the legality of his federal convictions and sentence. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-8\">We have considered all of Smith-Stewart\u2019s arguments and find them to be without merit. Accordingly, substantially for the reasons stated by the district court, we AFFIRM the denial of his petition for a writ of habeas corpus.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
