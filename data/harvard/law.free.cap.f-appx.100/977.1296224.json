Kangas filed the application to challenge his 50-year sentence for injury to a child. The district court granted a certificate of appealability (COA) on whether Kangas\u2019s delayed receipt of the state court\u2019s notice regarding the denial of his application for state habeas relief could equitably toll the one-year statute of limitations under the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act (AEDPA).</p>\n<p id=\"b1008-5\">This court reviews a district court\u2019s decision whether to apply equitable tolling for abuse of discretion. <em>Fisher v. Johnson, </em>174 F.3d 710, 713 (5th Cir.1999). The AEDPA\u2019s statute of limitations may be equitably tolled, but only in \u201crare and exceptional circumstances.\u201d <em>Felder v. Johnson, </em>204 F.3d 168, 170-171 (5th Cir.2000). The state\u2019s delay of nine days in transmitting the notice of the court\u2019s action on Kangas\u2019s application for state habeas relief, in combination with Kangas waiting until only three days remained in the statutory period to file his state writ application, does not constitute a \u201crare and exceptional circumstance\u201d warranting equitable tolling. <em>See Ott v. Johnson, </em>192 F.3d 510, 514 (5th Cir.1999). Therefore, the judgment of the district court dismissing Kan-gas\u2019s \u00a7 2254 application is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b1008-7\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
