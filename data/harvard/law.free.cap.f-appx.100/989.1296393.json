Aguilar contends that the district court erred in determining it lacked authority under \u00a7 5K2.0 of the Sentencing Guidelines to grant a downward departure based upon Aguilar\u2019s early entry of his guilty plea (two hours after arraignment). A district court\u2019s application of the Guidelines is reviewed <em>de novo; </em>its findings of fact, for clear error. <em>E.g., United States v. Ocana, </em>204 F.3d 585, 588 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>531 U.S. 880, 121 S.Ct. 192, 148 L.Ed.2d 133 (2000). Because this case involves whether the district court correctly determined it lacked authority to grant the downward departure under \u00a7 5K2.0, we have jurisdiction. <em>E.g., United States v. Valencia-Gonzales, </em>172 F.3d 344, 346 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>528 U.S. 894, 120 S.Ct. 222, 145 L.Ed.2d 187 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b1019-25\">Referencing 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(b), Guidelines \u00a7 5K2.0 provides that the sentencing court may impose a sentence outside the range established by the applicable guidelines, if it finds \u201cthat there exists an aggravating or mitigating circumstance of a kind, or to a degree, not adequately taken into consideration by the Sentencing Commission in formulating the guidelines that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"990\">*990</page-number>should result in a sentence different from that described\u201d. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(b). Some authority exists in the commentaries to the guidelines, as well as from other courts that have addressed the issue, that the district court has the authority to depart under \u00a7 5K2.0 in an exceptional case. <em>See United States v. Shah, </em>263 F.Supp.2d 10, 36-37 (D.D.C.2003); <em>United States v. Dethlefs, </em>123 F.3d 39, 46 (1st Cir.1997); \u00a7 5K2.0, comment. (n.3(B)(i))(Nov.2003), comment. (Nov.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b1020-4\">Aguilar\u2019s base offense level was reduced for acceptance of responsibility. Assuming, without deciding, that the district court had the discretion under \u00a7 5K2.0 to depart, Aguilar has not alleged any facts that would warrant a departure.</p>\n<p id=\"b1020-5\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b1019-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
