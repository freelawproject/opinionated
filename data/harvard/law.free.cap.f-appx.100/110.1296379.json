We will deny Angelica Castaneda-Corona\u2019s petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>I.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-5\">On May 9,1996, deportation proceedings were initiated against Castaneda-Corona, a native and citizen of Mexico who entered the United States on July 29, 1989 without inspection. The Immigration and Naturalization Service charged her with deportability under former section 241(a)(1)(B) of the INA, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1251(a)(1)(B) (1994). On January 31, 1997, Castaneda-Corona appeared before an Immigration Judge and conceded deportability but sought relief in the form of suspension of deportation under former section 244(a)(1) of the INA, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1254(a)(1) (1994). In an oral decision dated July 15, 1998, the Immigration Judge denied Castaneda-Corona\u2019s application for suspension of deportation but granted her request for voluntary departure. She filed a timely notice of appeal with the Board of Immigration Appeals. On July 31, 2002, the Board issued an order summarily affirming the decision of the Immigration Judge under 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 3.1(a)(7). Castaneda-Corona appeals, contending the Board\u2019s application of the streamlining provisions to her case deprived her of an individualized determination and violated her due process rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-6\">Under the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 (\u201cIIRIRA\u201d), Pub.L. No. 104-208, 110 Stat. 3009, deportation proceedings initiated pri- or to April 1, 1997, for which a final order of deportation is issued after October 30, 1996, are subject to \u201ctransitional rules of judicial review.\u201d The transitional rules apply here because the deportation proceedings were initiated on May 9,1996, and the Immigration Judge\u2019s Deportation Order was issued on July 15,1998.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-10\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-11\">Castaneda-Corona\u2019s challenge to the constitutionality of the streamlining procedures is foreclosed by <em>Dia v. Ashcroft, </em>353 F.3d 228 (3d Cir.2003) (en banc).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b141-12\">Castaneda-Corona appeals the Board\u2019s denial of suspension of deportation relief under former section 244. Under former section 244, the Attorney General may offer suspension of deportation to an alien who has been physically present in the United States for at least seven years, possesses good moral character, and \u201cwhose deportation would, <em>in the opinion </em>of the Attorney General, result in extreme hardship to the alien or to [a qualifying relative] who is a citizen of the United States or an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence.\u201d INA \u00a7 244(a)(1), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1254(a)(1) (1994) (emphasis added). The use of the phrase \u201cin the opinion\u201d indicates that the determination of whether the applicant will face extreme hardship is at the discretion of the Attorney General. <em>See Fatin v. INS, </em>12 F.3d 1233, 1243 (3d Cir.1993). IIRIRA\u2019s transitional rules provide that \u201cthere shall be no appeal of any discretionary decision under\u201d section 244 of the INA as in effect as of the date of the enactment of the Act. IIRIRA \u00a7 309(c)(4)(E).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Accordingly, we lack <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>jurisdiction to review Castaneda-Corona\u2019s challenge to the determination that she failed to establish extreme hardship under former section 244.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-4\">Castaneda-Corona also challenges the Board\u2019s decision to apply the streamlining regulations to her particular case. To decide whether streamlining is appropriate, we would necessarily be engaged in a merits analysis of the extreme hardship claim. <em>See Carriche v. Ashcroft, </em>350 F.3d 845, 854 (9th Cir.2003). Because we lack jurisdiction to review the merits of the discretionary decision regarding the extreme hardship requirement, we are also without jurisdiction to evaluate the discretionary decision of whether streamlining was appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-6\">For the foregoing reasons, we will deny Castaneda-Corona\u2019s petition for review.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b141-7\">.
