A panel of the Hearing Board recommended that respondent receive the oral and written reprimand of the Commission. The Administrator filed exceptions to the recommendation of the Hearing Board, and the Review Board recommended that respondent be suspended for one year.</p> <p id=\"b321-9\" pgmap=\"321\">The evidence consists of the testimony of respondent and a number of exhibits. Philip Bradbury, the complainant, could not be located and was believed to be living in Mexico.</p> <p id=\"b321-10\" pgmap=\"321\">Respondent testified that he had met Bradbury 30 years earlier when he (respondent), at age 15, was working for his father\u2019s bookbinding business. Bradbury and respondent\u2019s father were business acquaintances and were both engaged in the bookbinding business. When respondent started his law practice, Bradbury became one of his first clients.</p> <p id=\"b321-11\" pgmap=\"321(38) 322(34)\">Bradbury became indebted to respondent as a result of a number of transactions. When respondent\u2019s father died, respondent inherited his father\u2019s bookbinding equipment. Respondent asked Bradbury to sell the equipment for him. Bradbury apparently sold the equipment, but did not account to respondent for the proceeds of the sale. Respondent had loaned money to Bradbury which had not been fully repaid, and he had not been paid for various legal services.</p> <p id=\"b322-5\" pgmap=\"322\">In March or April of 1978 Bradbury came to respondent\u2019s office. He was the contract purchaser of land in Lake County and was having problems paying the installments as they became due. He asked respondent to assist him in selling the property and negotiating an offer or a contract. Initially respondent refused because Bradbury was already heavily indebted to him. Bradbury told respondent that the only way he could pay respondent was if he sold the land, saying, \u201cYou\u2019ll take the money out of the sale once you get it closed.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b322-6\" pgmap=\"322\">Bradbury told respondent that Charles Corder had made several offers to purchase the property. Respondent contacted Corder and negotiated a contract for the sale of the land. Corder delivered to respondent a cashier\u2019s check in the amount of $40,000 payable to \u201cArnold Kramer, Escrowee for Philip Bradbury,\u201d as earnest money.</p> <p id=\"b322-7\" pgmap=\"322\">Respondent testified that the land was sold for $300,000, and customarily the amount of earnest money to be placed in escrow would be 10%, or $30,000. Respondent, however, insisted on a $40,000 escrow deposit, because the deposit was to cover the debt Bradbury owed him plus respondent\u2019s fees for negotiating the contract and acting as Bradbury\u2019s attorney in the sale. Respondent testified that the escrow deposit was his money, subject to some accounting. The parties stipulated that the check was deposited into an account which was used by respondent \u201cfor his own purposes.\u201d Shortly after the check was deposited the balance in this account fell below $40,000, and several times before the land transaction was closed, the account was overdrawn.</p> <p id=\"b322-8\" pgmap=\"322(15) 323(47)\">Respondent structured the transaction so that the contract seller, Howerton, conveyed the land to three land trusts. At the first closing, Bradbury assigned his beneficial interest in the land trusts to Corder upon payment of the first installment of approximately $160,000. As Corder paid the specified sums of money, he was assigned the beneficial interests in the other land trusts.</p> <p id=\"b323-5\" pgmap=\"323\">At the time of the first closing, respondent asked Bradbury to \u201chave an accounting.\u201d Bradbury declined, however, and no accounting was made until six months later. Respondent \u201csettled\u201d with Bradbury and issued him a check for $14,160.53, the difference between the $40,000 escrow deposit and the amount Bradbury owed respondent for past debts plus the fees owed for the sale of the property. Bradbury did not at any time negotiate the check. He filed suit against respondent in the United States district court. That action was settled for $26,000.</p> <p id=\"b323-6\" pgmap=\"323\">The hearing panel found:</p> <blockquote id=\"b323-7\" pgmap=\"323\">\u201cWhat stands out is this: When a lawyer closes a real estate deal for a client, no matter how many hats the lawyer wears, his duty as a lawyer is to put those funds in a trust account and never to disburse them without the prior certain approval of a client. Respondent violated this essential rule. He cannot escape his obligations as a lawyer by explaining that he was also a creditor, vendor and negotiator.\u201d (Emphasis in original.)</blockquote> <p id=\"b323-8\" pgmap=\"323\">The Review Board concluded:</p> <blockquote id=\"b323-9\" pgmap=\"323\">\u201cThe record clearly and convincingly reflects that Respondent did not preserve the identity of his client\u2019s funds in a trust account.\u201d</blockquote> <p id=\"b323-10\" pgmap=\"323\">Assuming that, as testified by respondent, he and Bradbury had agreed that he would be paid from the escrow funds, the deposit of those funds in respondent\u2019s account, admittedly used \u201cfor his own purposes,\u201d nevertheless violated Disciplinary Rule 9 \u2014 102(a), which provides:</p> <blockquote id=\"b323-11\" pgmap=\"323(31) 324(38)\">\u201c(a) Other than advances for costs and expenses, all funds of clients paid to a lawyer or law firm, including funds belonging in part to a client and in part presently or potentially to the lawyer or law firm, shall be deposited in one or more separate identifiable trust bank accounts maintained in the State in which the law office is situated.\u201d (85 Ill. 2d R. 9\u2014102(a).)</blockquote> <p id=\"b324-5\" pgmap=\"324\">Assuming agreement that some portion of the funds was unquestionably due respondent, respondent\u2019s failure to segregate the funds in dispute until the dispute was settled violated Disciplinary Rule 9\u2014102(b) (85 Ill. 2d R. 9\u2014 02(b)). (See In re Schlax (1980), 81 Ill. 2d 66, 70-71.) Moreover, the funds were designated by Corder as escrow funds, and respondent admitted that Corder was unaware of any agreement between Bradbury and respondent as to the ownership of the funds. Respondent argues that since all but the most remote contingencies affecting Corder\u2019s ownership of the land were removed, no harm came to Corder by reason of respondent\u2019s failure to deposit the escrow money in a trust account. An attorney may not disburse escrow funds when he believes it is safe to do so; an escrowee may disburse escrow funds only in accordance with the terms of the escrow agreement. Ortman v. Kane (1945), 389 Ill. 613, 621.</p> <p id=\"b324-6\" pgmap=\"324\">As we have noted, the evidence shows that before the transaction was closed the balance in respondent\u2019s account fell below $40,000 and on several occasions the account was overdrawn. Although the evidence would support a finding of conversion (see In re Freel (1982), 89 Ill. 2d 263, 269; In re Clayter (1980), 78 Ill. 2d 276, 282-83) neither the Hearing Board nor the Review Board found that respondent had converted the funds. Although we find no evidence of intent to convert the funds, we cannot condone the manner in which respondent sought to resolve the problem with his client.</p> <p id=\"b324-7\" pgmap=\"324\">It is not necessary that there be evidence of a dishonest motive in order to impose discipline, but its absence is properly considered in determining the appropriate sanction.</p> <p id=\"b324-8\" pgmap=\"324(10) 325(123)\">Respondent contends that the facts of this case do not warrant suspension. We agree. This is similar to In re Freel, where only one instance of violation of the Code of Professional Responsibility has been shown and no bad faith or dishonest motive appears from the record. Our primary consideration in determining the nature and extent of discipline to be imposed in any particular case is the protection of the public and the integrity of the profession. (In re Grant (1982), 89 Ill. 2d 247, 254; see In re Nadler (1982), 91 Ill. 2d 326, 334.) There was no impropriety in respondent\u2019s attempting to protect his financial interests; however, because of his status as an attorney involved in the transaction, the method he employed to protect his interests was improper.</p> <p id=\"b325-5\" pgmap=\"325\">The record shows that the complainant attempted to use withdrawal of the complaint in this disciplinary proceeding as a bargaining tool to increase the amount of the settlement of the case which he had filed against respondent in the United States district court. After that case was settled, he apparently lost all interest in the disciplinary proceeding. Some of the facts and circumstances of this case suggest that it is not always the client who is in need of protection.</p> <p id=\"b325-6\" pgmap=\"325\">We conclude that for the violation of Disciplinary Rules 9\u2014102(a) and 9\u2014102(b) shown by this record the appropriate sanction is censure.</p> <p id=\"b325-7\" pgmap=\"325\">Respondent censured.</p> </opinion> <opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\"> <author id=\"b325-8\" pgmap=\"325\">JUSTICE UNDERWOOD,</author> <p id=\"Af\" pgmap=\"325\">dissenting:</p> <p id=\"b325-9\" pgmap=\"325(81) 326(5)\">It is undisputed that respondent deposited the $40,000 down payment in his personal checking account upon which both he and his wife could draw checks. That account was, prior to any accounting between respondent and his client, not only reduced below $40,000 but was overdrawn. Respondent defends this action as not improper because, he testified, his client and he had agreed the down payment was to be respondent\u2019s, subject to a later accounting, as reimbursement for fees and money owed him by the client.</p> <p id=\"b326-5\" pgmap=\"326\">While the client was not available to testify, and respondent\u2019s testimony was not directly contradicted, the fact that the client subsequently found it necessary to sue him and that respondent settled that suit for approximately double the amount he originally tendered his client seems to indicate the client did not-understand the agreement as respondent did.</p> <p id=\"b326-6\" pgmap=\"326\">In my judgment, the hearing panel aptly characterized this situation in its recommendation when it stated:</p> <blockquote id=\"b326-7\" pgmap=\"326\">\u201cWhat stands out is this: When a lawyer closes a real estate deal for a client, no matter how many hats the lawyer wears, his duty as a lawyer is to put those funds in a trust account and never to disburse them without the prior certain approval of a client. Respondent violated this essential rule. He cannot escape his obligation as a lawyer by explaining that he was also a creditor, vendor and negotiator.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b326-8\" pgmap=\"326\">His conduct has put our profession in disrepute.\u201d</blockquote> <p id=\"Au\" pgmap=\"326\">Although neither the hearing nor review board so found, the majority concedes the evidence would support a finding of conversion. There is, in my opinion, no question but that respondent converted his client\u2019s money, since the client had not consented to dissipation of the entire $40,000 by respondent without an accounting, and that is exactly what occurred when respondent overdrew the account. The circumstances surrounding a conversion, together with other factors, determine the discipline to be imposed. Obviously the circumstances here are not as aggravating as in some cases, but I do not regard as adequate the reprimand ordered by the hearing panel or the censure ordered by the court.
