The Court of Special Appeals discerned no error. <em>See Robinson v. State, </em>117 Md.App. 253, 275, 277-78, 699 A.2d 570, 581, 583-84 (1997). Accordingly, that court affirmed the judgment of the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County. We shall reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-10\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-11\">The petitioner was convicted by a jury of, <em>inter alia, </em>assault with the intent to murder, robbery with a dangerous weapon, assault with the intent to rob, conspiracy to commit robbery with a dangerous weapon, three counts of use of a handgun in the commission of a crime of violence, two counts of false imprisonment, and battery,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> all in relation to the robbery of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>7-11 store in Forestville, Maryland, on January 18,1996. The petitioner was sentenced to 50 years imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-5\">The State and the petitioner differed sharply as to the facts of the robbery, as well as on the petitioner\u2019s involvement in it. Civilian witnesses, <em>ie., </em>the victims, established that two men, both masked, were involved in the robbery. One of the men, clad in blue jeans, black sneakers, and a \u201cplaid\u201d shirt,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> accosted one of the victims while she was emptying trash, put a gun to her head and took money from her purse. The other man forced the other two victims to lie on the floor and demanded the store\u2019s money. The testimony was that the store\u2019s safe, to which the victims did not have the key, was taken from the store by the robbers.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Also presented was testimony concerning the post arrest search of the scene, which resulted in the recovery of the safe and some U.S. currency and coins in wrapping tubes from the parking lot. In addition, the State offered evidence that it recovered $139.00 in coins, which were contained in \u201cthe same kind of tube\u201d used by 7-11, and ninety-six Maryland lottery tickets from the front seat of the Nissan Pathfinder the petitioner was driving.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-6\">The State also offered, in its case, evidence directly linking the petitioner to the robbery and detailing his participation in the assaults on the two police officers. Officer Smith and Corporal Hooper, who responded to the call that the 7-11 was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>being robbed, testified that, upon their arrival, they saw two men in ski masks come out of the store and enter a Nissan Pathfinder. Officer Smith stated that when that vehicle accelerated straight toward him, he fired at it and it skidded to a stop in a snowbank. Corporal Hooper testified that, at that point, prior to slipping on the ice and sliding to the passenger side of the Pathfinder, he yelled at the occupants to place their hands out of the vehicle and that one of the gunmen fired at Officer Smith. Corporal Hooper also testified that after he slipped and fell, shots were fired at him from the passenger side window. Both officers returned the gunfire. According to the officers, Tyrone Glover surrendered without further incident, but the petitioner got out of the vehicle with a gun in his hand. Rather than heed Corporal Hooper\u2019s command to drop the gun, they continued, the petitioner pointed it and started to scream and pull the trigger, prompting them to fire at him, striking him four times. The gun the petitioner used was recovered from the scene, having fallen near the petitioner\u2019s right hand. The testimony also was that a gun holster was found in the petitioner\u2019s pants.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-5\">By contrast, the petitioner, the lone defense witness, testified that he played no role in the 7-11 robbery. While he admitted that he was driving the Pathfinder, he said that he was driving Tyrone Glover home and that he stopped at the 7-11 because Glover asked him to stop there. The petitioner claimed to have waited for Glover in the Pathfinder until he received a page and went to use the pay phone. He testified that Glover returned to the vehicle, and fumbled around in it before going back into the store. When Glover returned the second time, the petitioner stated that he was waiting in the Pathfinder, and that when he started to drive out of the parking lot, several shots were fired at his truck from behind a snowbank. One of the shots struck one of the Pathfinder\u2019s tires, causing the petitioner to lose control and the Pathfinder to skid into a snowbank. The petitioner maintains that he got out of the Pathfinder with his hands raised, but that he nevertheless was shot several times. He denied being armed or having any knowledge of the gun holster.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>At trial, during his counsel\u2019s cross-examination of Officer Smith and Corporal Hooper, the petitioner learned that both officers had given statements to the IAD concerning the events surrounding the robbery and the arrest of the petitioner and his alleged co-conspirator, Tyrone Glover. The petitioner did not ask to review Officer Smith\u2019s IAD statement at any time during Officer Smith\u2019s cross-examination; however, when Corporal Hooper also testified that'he had provided a statement to the IAD, the petitioner requested a bench conference, at which he requested both officers\u2019 IAD statements, prompting the following exchange:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AZ\">DEFENSE COUNSEL: \u201cYour Honor, it appears there is no\u2014I\u2019m looking at Rule 4-263, discovery in circuit court. And it talks about disclosure upon request and we made a request in this case. Witnesses, statements of the defendant, statements of codefendants, reports or statements of experts, evidence for use at trial and property of the defendant. But it does not talk about witness\u2019 statements. It has been my understanding\u2014had been my understanding, Your Honor, that the witness\u2019 statements were discoverable, but they didn\u2019t have to hand them over until that witness was on the witness stand or had finished direct examination.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b330-6\">THE COURT: \u201cI think that refers to witness\u2019 statements that are statements taken by investigating officers of witnesses, not statements given to Internal Affairs. My question to you is what authority do you have that in the discovery in a criminal case, statements taken under the police officers\u2019 Bill of Rights by Internal Affairs are discoverable?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b330-7\">\u00cd $</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b330-8\">DEFENSE COUNSEL: \u201cThese two officers, Officer Smith and Officer Hooper, are obviously the two stars of this particular show so to speak. And they both have made extensive arguments or at least Officer\u2014Corporal Smith has. . He gave a 30 page written statement to Internal Affairs. And this other Officer, Officer Hooper, gave a two <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>page typewritten statement to Internal Affairs. ... [A]nd I have no way of knowing if there\u2019s anything exculpatory.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AnF\">Although at the conclusion of this colloquy, the prosecutor expressed her belief that the statements were not discoverable and the court noted, \u201cI spent five years in [the State\u2019s Attorney\u2019s] office and I never saw a statement made to Internal Affairs,\u201d the court asked the prosecutor to \u201cinquire of the availability of those statements only to determine whether there is anything exculpatory within them and for no other purpose at this point\u201d and, recessing for the day, told counsel to be in its chambers the next day.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-5\">When the petitioner resumed cross examination of Corporal Hooper on the next day, he established that a Fraternal Order of Police attorney had spoken with both officers. His attempt to show that the attorney actually represented Corporal Hooper in the Internal Affairs investigation was met by an objection by the State. At the bench conference convened to consider the objection, the following occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b331-6\">THE COURT: \u201cI\u2019m going to sustain the objection. But more than that, if this area is gone into by further interrogation or in final argument, I intend on my own to instruct this jury that I have viewed the statements, that these police officers were exonerated and that I have found the statement to be totally consistent with their testimony here today.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b331-7\">DEFENSE COUNSEL: \u201cYour Honor, my last question to him was based solely on his answer to my previous question.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ABK\">THE COURT: \u201cI\u2019m just telling you what I\u2019m going to do.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Act\">DEFENSE COUNSEL: \u201cRight.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b331-8\">THE COURT: \u201cYou\u2019re free to do whatever you would like to do.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b331-9\">DEFENSE COUNSEL: \u201cWhat I\u2019m saying, Your Honor, is that I asked him if he talked with him. He\u2019s the one who brought up talking to the lawyer. I wanted to make sure which lawyer he was talking to and for what purpose. I was not trying to get into the Internal Affairs Investigation, and he was the one that brought that up and not me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b332-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>THE COURT: \u201cWe\u2019re all' on the same page. The ball is in your court.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b332-4\">Counsel had appeared in the court\u2019s chambers, as instructed, along with an attorney from the County Attorney\u2019s office and, as reported by the court,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> the following occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b332-5\">\u201cBased upon [defense counsel\u2019s] request at the close of our trial day yesterday, I requested that counsel appear in chambers at 8:30, and that the statements made by Officer Smith and Hooper to Internal Affairs be available to us at that time. Both counsel and Mr. Aurich from the County Attorney\u2019s Office representing the plaintiff and defendant appeared and we informally discussed procedurally how. we would proceed. We discussed how we wished to proceed whether totally on the record\u2014I extended that option\u2014or merely having an informal discussion regarding procedure, and then having had that informal discussion, making the record subsequently which we are now doing..</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b332-6\">\u201c[Defense counsel\u2019s] position was that he was entitled to both the statements of Officer Smith and Officer Hooper to the Internal Affairs department. Mr. Aurich\u2019s position on behalf of the Police Department was that these matters were a part of the officers\u2019 personnel files and were not subject to production in this matter or any other matter. I made the decision that I would view the documents in camera to determine whether there was any exculpatory information in either of the statements. I have conducted that <em>in camera </em>review.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b332-7\">\u201cI have determined that there is no exculpatory information in either of those two statements. I have copies of the statements that are being sealed and marked as Court\u2019s Exhibit No. 1 and will be preserved with the evidence that has been admitted in this case thus far for any future court proceedings.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b333-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>Subsequently, the State called a firearms examiner to testify about the gun recovered from the petitioner and how it differed from those used by the police. On cross examination, the petitioner inquired about, and into, the trajectory analysis done by the witness. This prompted another objection by the State and yet another bench conference to consider it. The State complained that the trajectory analysis \u201cgoes specifically to the departmental shooting.\u201d Pointing out that objections to inquiring into that area had been sustained previously, the State urged the court to give the instruction on the internal affairs investigation that the court indicated it would give if the petitioner further pursued that line of inquiry. The petitioner disagreed, arguing that cross examination on the trajectory analysis was relevant to more than the internal affairs investigation. He contended that the evidence was in dispute with regard to how wide the Pathfinder\u2019s window was open, a photograph showing only about 3 inches, while the officers\u2019 testimony indicated that it was open wide enough to accommodate an arm. Thus, the petitioner maintained that the trajectory analysis, demonstrating that all of the bullet holes came from the outside headed inside, was relevant to credibility. The bench conference ended in this exchange:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AM-\">The Court: \u201cOkay. I\u2019m going to let you go into it and I\u2019m going to instruct on the Internal Affairs investigation so go ahead.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b333-5\">Defense Counsel: \u201cI don\u2019t want to interrupt you, but if that\u2019s what you think you have to do that\u2019s fine. But I think that\u2019s important that this gets examined.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b333-6\">The Court: \u201cI agree with you so we\u2019ll get it all out.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b333-7\">Thereafter, the petitioner resumed his cross examination of the firearms examiner and, as it had indicated it would, the court gave an \u201cinstruction\u201d on the IAD investigation, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b333-8\">\u201c[Ljadies and gentlemen of the jury, it\u2019s come out in this case that two matters are going on here. First, there is this case that is for you to consider; and secondly, there\u2019s the internal investigation by the police department which takes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>place every time a police officer fires his weapon. Just so there\u2019s no issue in this case, I have precluded evidence of the Internal Affairs investigation thus far. We\u2019re now into it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b334-5\">\u201cI will tell you the Internal Affairs investigation cleared the two police officers. I will tell you that I have examined the two statements that were made by the two police officers to the Internal Affairs people and have found nothing in there that is exculpatory in this case. And for that reason neither the investigation nor those statements will be coming into this case. But now that the issue has been opened, I want the issue to be fully presented to you.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b334-6\">Still later, after the State had rested and just prior to the petitioner\u2019s presenting its case, the jury sent the court a note, requesting it to \u201c[pjlease [djefine exculpatory.\u201d When the court informed the parties that it intended to instruct that \u201cit means free from guilt,\u201d the petitioner objected and moved for mistrial:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AD7\">\u201cDefense Counsel: Your Honor, I was thinking about it over lunchtime. I really think that we need a mistrial in this case. And the reason being that for the State to come in here and try to put in evidence as to what happened in this case and to fragment the evidence into departmental shooting evidence or evidence as to what happened at the time of the shooting, which have to go into in order to defend\u2014..</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b334-8\">\u201cThe Court: You don\u2019t have to go into evidence. And that was the only purpose, that that Internal Affairs Investigation is totally irrelevant to what this jury has to decide. But if you want to put it in, then they have a right to be fully informed of it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b334-9\">* \u2756 *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b334-10\">\u201cDefense Counsel: At this time I will move for a mistrial. I don\u2019t think the Court should give the type of instruction as to exculpatory or not. I can\u2019t remember the last time I <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>heard of a police shooting that wasn\u2019t found to be a good shooting, at least not in the Washington metro area.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b335-5\">\u201cThe Court: Okay. You don\u2019t wish to take any position on it? '</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b335-6\">\u201cDefense Counsel: I think the Court should not answer that question.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b335-7\">\u201cThe Court: I\u2019m going to answer it. You don\u2019t have any input into my answering it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b335-8\">\u201cDefense Counsel: No, Your Honor. I think an answer would be another reason for a mistrial.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b335-9\">\u201cThe Court: I deny the motion for mistrial.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b335-10\">The Court instructed the jury as it said it would, that exculpatory \u201cmean[s] free from guilt... the opposite of guilty.\u201d The jury returned the verdicts as heretofore reported and the petitioner was sentenced.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-11\">The petitioner noted an appeal to the Court of Special Appeals. As we have seen that court affirmed, <em>see Robinson, </em>117 Md.App. 253, 699 A.2d 570, and we granted the petitioner\u2019s Petition for Certiorari to resolve the important questions presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-12\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-13\">The intermediate appellate court recognized that \u201c[ujnder the principles adopted by the Court of Appeals in <em>Carr v. State, </em>284 Md. 455, 397 A.2d 606 (1979), as well as <em>Jencks v. United States, </em>353 U.S. 657, 77 S.Ct. 1007, 1 L.Ed.2d 1103 (1957), and the \u2018Jeneks Act,\u2019 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3500 (1994), a defendant is entitled to production of a witness\u2019 prior statement if, <em>inter alia, </em>the prosecution or the prosecutorial arm of the government is in \u2018possession\u2019 of the statement.\u201d <em>Robinson </em>at 257, 699 A.2d at 572. It held, however, first, that when a statement is confidential under state law, and developed for non-prosecutorial purposes, and held by a division of a law enforcement agency that is not working in conjunction with the prosecutor, the State does not have access to the statement for the purposes of the <em>Jencks/Carr </em>rule, and hence, the defendant is not entitled to production of the statement. <em>See </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number><em>id. </em>Second, the court held that any error the trial court may have committed when it \u201cinstructed\u201d the jury concerning the IAD investigation, and its outcome, was not preserved in accordance with Maryland Rule 4-825(e),<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and, in any event, the definition of \u201cexculpatory\u201d provided, being correct, did not constitute \u201cplain error\u201d meriting discretionary review. <em>See id. </em>at 277-79, 699 A.2d at 583-84.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-5\">(a)</p>\n<p id=\"b336-6\">The petitioner argues that it was error for the trial court to refuse to permit him to review, in connection with cross-examination, the statements Officer Smith and Corporal Hooper made to the IAD. Relying on the Jencks Act, the policy underpinnings of which, he says, citing <em>Bruce v. State, </em>318 Md. 706, 724, 569 A.2d 1254, 1263 (1990); <em>Carr v. State, </em>284 Md. 455, 460-61, 397 A.2d 606, 608-09 (1979); <em>State v. Leonard, </em>290 Md. 295, 429 A.2d 538 (1981), affirming, <em>Leonard v. State, </em>46 Md.App. 631, 421 A.2d 85 (1980), applies in Maryland, the petitioner contends that statements in the possession of the IAD of the Prince George\u2019s County Police Department are in the possession of the State, because courts have uniformly held that material in the possession of the police is in the possession of the prosecution and must be produced under <em>Brady v. Maryland, </em>373 U.S. 83, 87, 83 S.Ct. 1194, 1196-97, 10 L.Ed.2d 215, 218-19 (1963). For this proposition, he cites <em>Ortega v. People, </em>162 Colo. 358, 426 P.2d 180, 182 (1967), and <em>State v. Thornburgh, </em>220 N.W.2d 579, 586-7 (Iowa 1974); <em>Commonwealth v. French, </em>396 Pa.Super. 436, 578 A.2d 1292 (1990); <em>U.S. v. Gonzalez </em>110 F.3d 936, 943 (2nd Cir.1997). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>Also, he points out that the other Jencks Act requirements are met in this case: \u201cthe statements requested were made by witnesses who testified for the prosecution, were requested by the defense, qualify as discoverable Jencks Acts statements, and relate to the subject matter of the witness\u2019 testimony.\u201d The petitioner further asserts that, although the statements were not in the actual possession of the State when the request was made, the State had access to these statements, proof of which was demonstrated when the State produced them at the trial court\u2019s request. Again relying on <em>Carr, </em>as well as <em>Leonard, </em>the petitioner argues further that the trial court\u2019s review of the statements <em>in camera </em>was insufficient, because \u201c[a]s the decisions of this Court make clear, the trial court\u2019s <em>in camera </em>review of the statements did not satisfy the requirements of <em>Jencks; </em>defense counsel should have been afforded an opportunity to inspect the statements.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b337-5\">The petitioner\u2019s final contention in this Court is that \u201c[t]he trial judge erred in its instructions to the jury concerning the officers\u2019 statements during [the] Internal Affairs Division Investigation and the outcome of that investigation.\u201d Those instructions, the petitioner asserts, invaded the province of the jury and usurped its role as the determiner of credibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-6\">(b)</p>\n<p id=\"b337-7\">The State avers that the petitioner was not entitled to review the witness\u2019 statements because they were not in the possession of the prosecution; \u201c[o]nly statements in the hands of the State are discoverable under <em>Jencks. Goldsmith v. State, </em>337 Md. 112, 126, 651 A.2d 866 (1995); <em>Bruce v. State, </em>318 Md. at 725-26, 569 A.2d 1254.\u201d It makes clear that it is not \u201ccontending] that the police are not ordinarily an arm of the prosecution, <em>see e.g., Barbee v. Warden, Maryland Penitentiary, </em>331 F.2d 842, 846 (4th Cir.1964) (the police are a part of the prosecution and disclosure requirement applies to them),\u201d only that statements made to the IAD are rendered confidential by \u00a7 728(b) of the Law Enforcement Officers\u2019 Bill of Rights (\u201cLEOBR\u201d), Maryland Code (1957, 1992 Repl-Vol., 1995 Cum.Supp.), Article 27, \u00a7\u00a7 727 to 734B, <em>see Mayor and </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number><em>City Council of Baltimore v. Maryland Committee Against the Gun Ban, </em>329 Md. 78, 617 A.2d 1040 (1993), so that they are neither in possession of the State nor, for that reason, subject to disclosure. In any event, the State argues that the trial court satisfied <em>Jencks </em>by conducting an <em>in camera </em>review of the IAD statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-5\">Finally, the State contends that only one of the petitioner\u2019s two jury instruction contentions is preserved for review.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> It points out that the petitioner\u2019s only objection was made to the trial court\u2019s instruction on the definition of exculpatory. The State thus urges the Court to hold that because the petitioner did not object to the initial jury instruction, he waived the claim on appeal. It asserts that the definition the trial court gave the jury was correct. In any event, the State maintains, the instructions did not constitute plain error, because \u201c[s]uch errors are only recognized when they deprive the defendant of his right to a fair trial. <em>See e.g., Bruce v. State, </em>328 Md. 594, 611, 616 A.2d 392 (1992), <em>cert. denied, </em>508 U.S. 963, 113 S.Ct. 2936, 124 L.Ed.2d 686 (1993).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b338-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-7\">In <em>Carr v. State, </em>the Court of Appeals adopted principles that were earlier enunciated by the Supreme Court in <em>Jencks v.

Those principles relate to the importance of cross examination and the significance, to an accused, of determining whether a witness\u2019 trial testimony is inconsistent with the witness\u2019 prior 'written statement on the subject.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-5\">The Supreme Court, in <em>Jencks, </em>353 U.S. at 668, 77 S.Ct. at 1013, 1 L.Ed.2d at 1111, held that, in criminal cases, after a witness has testified on direct examination for the prosecution and upon motion by the defense, the prosecution must produce for inspection all written reports or statements made by the witness concerning the subject matter of the testimony. Rationalizing the holding, the Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b339-6\">\u201cEvery experienced trial judge and trial lawyer knows the value for impeaching purposes of statements of the witness recording the events before time dulls treacherous memory. Flat contradiction between the witness\u2019 testimony and the version of the events given in his reports is not the only test of inconsistency. The omission from the reports of facts related at the trial, or a contrast in emphasis upon the same facts, even a different order of treatment, are also relevant to the cross-examining process of testing the credibility of a witness\u2019 trial testimony.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b339-7\">353 U.S. at 667, 77 S.Ct. at 1013, 1 L.Ed.2d at 1111.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-8\"><em>Carr </em>involved a prosecution for assault with intent to murder and related offenses, in which an important prosecution witness testified on matters involving identity in a manner that may have been inconsistent with the prior signed statement the witness gave the police on the morning of the incident. The defendant\u2019s request that the statement be produced was denied by the trial court. We opined:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b339-9\">\u201cEvery skilled trial advocate knows the crucial importance in such situations of cross-examination. Effective cross-examination here made it necessary that defense counsel be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>permitted to directly confront the witness with his inconsistent prior statement. To deny to defense counsel the tool necessary for such adequate cross-examination under these circumstances amounts in our view to a denial to the defendant of due process of law.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b340-4\">284 Md. at 472-73, 397 A.2d at 615. We thus held that, for cross-examination purposes, defense counsel is entitled to inspect prior written statements of crucial State\u2019s witnesses who have testified at trial to determine whether those statements are inconsistent with their trial testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-5\">This principle was reiterated and explicated in <em>State v. Leonard, </em>290 Md. 295, 429 A.2d 538 (1981), in which we affirmed <em>Leonard v. State, </em>46 Md.App. 631, 421 A.2d 85 (1980), for the \u201creasons set forth\u201d in the intermediate appellate court\u2019s opinion. Judge Wilner, later the Chief Judge of that court and now a member of this Court, speaking for the Court of Special Appeals, explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A35\"><em>\u201cCarr </em>makes clear beyond question that a defendant\u2019s right, at trial, to inspect the prior statement of a State\u2019s witness who has testified is not necessarily limited (1) by the rules pertaining to pretrial discovery, or (2) to statements that are merely exculpatory. When confronted with the actual testimony of a critical witness and the knowledge that the witness has given a prior statement bearing on a material issue in the case, counsel is not engaged in a mere \u201cfishing expedition\u201d in seeking access to the prior statement. At that point, it becomes more than a matter of casting a seine over the State\u2019s files to see what turns up, but of directly confronting the witness; and the statement thus assumes a specific importance and relevance beyond its general value for trial preparation. <em>See Carr, </em>284 Md. at 472, 397 A.2d 606. The- test clearly is whether the statement is, or may be, inconsistent with the witness\u2019 trial testimony, and thus usable in cross-examination.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b340-7\"><em>Leonard, </em>46 Md.App. at 637-38, 421 A.2d at 88-89.

A screening of the statement by the court cannot suffice as an effective substitute. The court cannot be expected to view in the same context as defense counsel these more latent and subtle gaps or differences; nor should it purport to do so. It is for that reason as well that the court erred. If any weight is to be given to the aforequoted considerations, as we think the Court of Appeals intended, it is incumbent upon the court, under the circumstances evident here, to permit counsel to inspect the statement and determine for himself whether it is or is not usable for cross-examination. The court still retains, of course, the ultimate right to determine whether the statement, or any part of it, is admissible in evidence, either as a document or through questions propounded to the witness. The issue here is not admissibility but inspection for possible use in cross-examination.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b341-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 638-39, 421 A.2d at 89.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-6\">Subsequent to the decision in <em>Jencks, </em>Congress enacted the \u201cJencks Act,\u201d clarifying and limiting the <em>Jencks </em>holding. <em>See Jones, </em>310 Md. at 584, 530 A.2d 743; <em>Jacocks, </em>50 Md.App. at 139, 436 A.2d 930. Although the Maryland Legislature has not enacted a counterpart to the \u201cJencks Act,\u201d both the petitioner and the State proceed, as did the Court of Special Appeals, <em>see </em>117 Md.App. at 257, 699 A.2d at 572, from the premise that this case is controlled by the Jencks Act. Neither <em>Carr </em>nor subsequent cases has wholly adopted the Jencks Act and its discovery rules. It is fair to say, however, that Maryland courts have looked to the Act, as well as subsequent analysis and interpretation of the statute, for guidance in interpreting the reach and ramifications of the <em>Carr </em>decision. <em>See Jones, </em>310 Md. 569, 530 A.2d 743; <em>Kanaras v. State, </em>54 Md.App. 568, 577, 460 A.2d 61 (1983) (Maryland courts have \u201cimplicitly accepted the underlying foundations\u201d of the Jencks Act \u201cwithout adopting wholesale the rules contained therein\u201d). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number><em>See also Bruce v.

To be sure, as the State concedes, ordinarily the police are an arm of the prosecution, for purposes of the <em>Jencks /Carr </em>analysis, and, thus, a disclosure requirement applicable to the prosecution applies to them as well. <em>See, e.g., Barbee v. Warden, Maryland Penitentiary, </em>331 F.2d 842, 846 (4th Cir.1964) (\u201c[t]he police are also part of the prosecution, and the taint on the trial is no less if they, rather than the State\u2019s Attorney, were guilty of the nondisclosure.\u201d); <em>State v.

The obligations of the State\u2019s Attorney under this Rule extend to material and information in the possession or control of the State\u2019s Attorney and staff members and any others who have participated in the investigation or evaluation of the action and who either regularly report, or with reference to the particular action have reported, to the office of the State\u2019s Attorney.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b342-7\">To the same effect are <em>Ortega v.

Thornburgh, </em>220 N.W.2d 579, 586-87 (Iowa 1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b343-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>The authorities are split, however, on the narrower question, whether, for purposes of <em>Jencks /Carr, </em>the Internal Affairs Division of a police department is an arm of the prosecution. Under the circumstances presented in <em>State v. Roy, </em>151 Vt. 17, 557 A.2d 884 (1989), the Supreme Court of Vermont said, \u201cno.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b343-5\">In Vermont, misconduct by State Troopers is required, by statute, to be investigated by the Office of Internal Investigation within the Department of Public Safety. Under the statute,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> records of any such investigation are confidential. Moreover, the statute contains no exceptions for the use of the records in court or for access to them by the prosecution. The defendant sought to obtain the file of the trooper that arrested him for use in the assault case that the trooper had brought against him. The Vermont Supreme Court denied the request, holding that the file was not in the \u201cpossession, custody, or control\u201d of the prosecution. <em>Id. </em>557 A.2d at 893-94. Thus, it was not discoverable. The court refused to put the prosecution in \u201cthe untenable position of facing an obligation to disclose a file that it did not have and was unable to get,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 894, noting that the defendant could subpoena the records from the Department of Public Safety, which could then state its position. <em>Id. </em>at 895.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-6\">A different result was reached in <em>Commonwealth v. French, </em>396 Pa.Super. 436, 578 A.2d 1292 (1990), <em>aff'd, </em>531 Pa. 42, 611 A.2d 175 (1992). In that case, the defendant, who had been charged with, <em>inter alia, </em>resisting arrest and assault, sought <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>discovery of the IAD file on the investigation of the incident triggering his arrest and the conduct of the officers involved, including the arresting officer. <em>Id. </em>578 A.2d at 1294. The trial court ordered the file produced, reviewed it <em>in camera, </em>and reported \u201cthat no exculpatory material was contained therein nor were any of the officers\u2019 statements inconsistent with the trial testimony thus far elicited.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1299. Affirming the refusal to disclose the entire file, the intermediate appellate court held that the statements the officers made to IAD should have been disclosed. <em>Id. </em>at 1301. Similar results were reached in <em>United States v. Gonzalez, </em>110 F.3d 936, 939 (2d Cir.1997) (testimony of police officer at a police hearing to determine whether an off-duty fellow officer was justified in firing weapon.); <em>United States v. Bruton, </em>647 F.2d 818, 827 (8th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>454 U.S. 868, 102 S.Ct. 333, 70 L.Ed.2d 170 (1981) (F.B.I. agent\u2019s shooting report is a statement for purposes of the Jencks Act and should have been produced.)</p>\n<p id=\"b344-4\">The difference between the cases is the focus of the court in <em>Roy </em>on the confidentiality of the records sought, while in neither of the cases relied upon by the petitioner does confidentiality seem to be an issue. Relying on that distinction and noting the <em>Roy </em>court\u2019s observation that \u201cin states where decisions have given defendants wide access to law enforcement personnel files in cases involving a claim of self-defense, there is either no specific privilege or confidentiality statute or the statute authorizes the result,\u201d the State, joining the Court of Special Appeals, maintains that whether the IAD statements are confidential is material to the issue of whether the prosecution possessed them; it asserts, \u201cit is <em>because </em>the records are confidential that the prosecutor was not entitled to them and therefore not in possession of them.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b345-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>Section 728(b)(5)(iii) and (iv) is offered as the authority for the conclusion that IAD records are confidential. It provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AQV\">\u201c(b) Whenever a law enforcement officer is under investigation or subjected to interrogation by a law enforcement agency, for any reason which could lead to disciplinary action, demotion or dismissal, the investigation or interrogation shall be conducted under the following conditions:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b345-5\">\u201c(5) ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b345-6\">\u201c(in) In addition, the law enforcement officer under investigation shall be furnished with a copy of the investigatory file and any exculpatory information, but excluding:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b345-7\">\u201c1. The identity of confidential sources;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b345-8\"><em>\u201c2. </em>Any nonexculpatory information; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b345-9\">\u201c3. Recommendations as to charges, disposition, or punishment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b345-11\">\u201c(iv) The law enforcement officer under investigation shall be furnished with a copy of the investigatory file and the exculpatory information described under subparagraph (iii) of this paragraph not less than 10 days before any hearing if the officer and the officer\u2019s representative agree:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b345-12\">\u201c1. To execute a confidentiality agreement with the law enforcement agency to not disclose any of the material contained in the record for any purpose other than to defend the officer; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b345-13\">\u201c2. To pay any reasonable charge for the cost of reproducing the material involved.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b345-14\">Subsection (b)(7)(ii) is also relevant, it makes clear that any statement by the officer \u201crequired by the law enforcement agency under this subparagraph [is] not admissible or discov<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>erable in any criminal proceedings against the law enforcement officer when the law enforcement officer has been ordered to submit thereto.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b346-5\">To be sure, \u00a7 728(5)(b)(iii) and (iv) of the Law Enforcement Officers\u2019 Bill of Eights limits access to the internal investigation file to the affected officer, and then only to exculpatory information, and does not expressly provide for access by anyone else. It is also true that this section requires execution of a confidentiality agreement, restricting disclosure to purposes of defending the officer, and that \u00a7 728(b)(7)(ii) prohibits, under certain circumstances, the use of any statements the officer may have given or the results of any tests he or she may have taken. These provisions deal only with the rights of the officer and serve as a protection for them. They do not address, or even purport to address, the due process concerns that are at the heart of the <em>Jencks \u00a1Carr </em>principle and are critical to the resolution of this case. Indeed, when due process concerns have been involved, the confidentiality of the records have been held to yield to those concerns. <em>Jacocks, supra, </em>50 Md.App. at 144, 436 A.2d at 936-37.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-6\">In that case, the issue was \u201cin the context both of statutory construction of LEOBR and the application of <em>Jencks-Carr ... </em>whether discovery of the statements in question is mandated as an extension of appellee\u2019s right under \u00a7 730(d) to cross-examine the -witnesses against him, or conversely, whether the internal investigation file is specifically privileged and thus non-disclosable under \u00a7 728(b)(12).\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 137, 436 A.2d at 933. Recognizing that Maryland has, \u201c[b]y judicial decision, ... adopted the underlying principles set forth in the Jencks Opinion, at least with respect to criminal cases, as a necessary outgrowth of the right of cross-examination,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 139, 436 A.2d at 934; and noting that \u201cadministrative agenci\u00e9s, including LEOBR hearing boards, must observe the basic rules of fairness, and that is what the <em>Jencks </em>rule is all about,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 143, 436 A.2d at 936, the court held that, notwithstanding the restriction on disclosure contained in the act, the officer was entitled to review, and use at his administrative <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>hearing, the statements given by witnesses during the IAD investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-4\">Confidentiality does not ordinarily negate possession, actual or constructive. In other words, that a statement may be confidential goes to its discoverability, rather than to who possesses it. In this State, each major police department has an IAD division. Consequently, because that division is a part of the police, its records are in the possession of the police. And if the police is an arm of the prosecution, it follows that the records are also constructively in the possession of the prosecution; records in the possession of the police are not rendered not in possession simply because they are made confidential and are not, on that account, shared with, or readily available to, the prosecution. As the petitioner points out,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b347-5\">\u201cMerely because the State is not required to produce confidential information does not automatically mean that it does not possess it. For example, the police officers involved in a[n] undercover investigation involving confidential informants know the identity of those informants. Even if the officers do not communicate that identity to the Assistant State\u2019s Attorney assigned to the case, the prosecution still \u2018possesses\u2019 this information and upon a sufficient proffer by the defense, can be required to produce it. If a sufficient proffer is not made, the identity may remain confidential but the prosecution in either scenario has \u2018possession\u2019 of it.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ASH\">While confidentiality does go to discoverability, it does not guarantee insulation of the confidential matter from disclosure. The confidentiality interest must be balanced, in this context, against the confrontation and due process rights of the defendant. <em>See Davis v. Alaska, </em>415 U.S. 308, 319, 94 S.Ct. 1105, 1112, 39 L.Ed.2d 347, 355 (1974) (weighing a defendant\u2019s confrontation right against the State\u2019s interest in the confidentiality of juvenile proceedings and striking the balance in favor of confrontation); <em>Goldsmith v.

Parnes, </em>134 N.J.Super. 61, 338 A.2d 223, 224 (1975). In <em>Martinez v. State, </em>309 Md. 124, 140, 522 A.2d 950, 960 (1987) and <em>Jones v. State, </em>297 Md. 7, 14-15, 464 A.2d 977, 982 (1983), we noted that a defendant may not be entitled to pre-trial disclosure of a witness\u2019 grand jury testimony, but the defendant may be entitled to the witness\u2019 grand jury testimony for cross-examination purposes, after the witness testifies at trial or at a suppression hearing. <em>See also State v. Watson, </em>173 W.Va. 553, 318 S.E.2d 603, 609-10 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b348-5\">As the petitioner forcefully argues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b348-6\">\u201cThe statements at issue in this case were given by these officers shortly after the incident to other members of the Prince George\u2019s County police. The statements concerned the very same matters which the officers testified to at trial. Even if ... the statements are confidential, Petitioner\u2019s trial right to cross-examination and confrontation overrides any, interest the State or the police have in keeping these records confidential. These are not sensitive statements involving children\u2019s educational progress or child abuse. These are statements by the officers explaining to their superiors how in the course of arresting Petitioner for robbery, they discharged forty-six shots, four of which hit Petitioner.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b349-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>This case is controlled by the <em>Jencks /Carr /Leonard </em>line of cases. These cases make clear that it is defense counsel, rather than the trial judge, who should review a witness\u2019s prior statement for inconsistency with his or her trial testimony. <em>Jencks v. United States, </em>353 U.S. at 669, 77 S.Ct. at 1014, 1 L.Ed.2d at 1112 (Court specifically disapproved a \u201cpractice of producing government documents to the trial judge for his determination of relevancy ... without hearing the accused .... \u201d); <em>Carr, </em>284 Md. at 472-73, 397 A.2d at 615; <em>Leonard, </em>46 Md.App. at 631, 421 A.2d at 85. <em>See also Jones v. State, supra, </em>297 Md. at 15, 464 A.2d at 981, in which this Court again emphasized the point:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-5\">\u201c[W]e hold that the procedure suggested by the State, and followed in some jurisdictions, of having the trial judge inspect the grand jury testimony to determine whether inconsistencies exist or whether that testimony would be of use to the defendant, as was done in this case, is improper.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-6\">\u201cWe see no difficulty with the trial judge reviewing the witnesses\u2019 grand jury testimony and excising those matters which do not relate to the subject case, but he should not be making decisions as to what is or is not inconsistent or immaterial to the defendant\u2019s case.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b349-7\">Indeed, \u201c[t]he State acknowledges that <em>Jencks </em>normally contemplates the opportunity of defense counsel to view the prior statement and that it has been deemed important to permit counsel\u2019s eye to examine the statement for inconsistencies [and that tjhere is generally no requirement for showing a particularized need for the document beyond the desire to test credibility and impeach the witness.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b349-8\">The State nevertheless maintains that <em>in camera </em>review was appropriately conducted in this case. It offers in support of that position that <em>Zaal </em>recognized a distinction between confidential and other records containing potentially impeaching information and, while discouraging it, recognized <em>in camera </em>review as a viable option available to trial courts. More<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>over, the State points out that the Jencks Act \u201ccontemplates\u201d <em>in camera </em>review to resolve claims that the statements sought do not relate to the witness\u2019s direct testimony, the rule implementing the Act provides for <em>in camera </em>review of statements containing \u201cprivileged information or matter that does not relate to the subject matter concerning which the witness has testified,\u201d <em>see </em>Fed. R.Crim. Pro. 26.2(c), and federal case law states that <em>in camera </em>review is the usual procedure in these cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-5\">We are not persuaded. As indicated, this Court has never expressly adopted the Jencks Act or the rule implementing it. Moreover, as we have seen, our own cases are at odds with the federal cases, more than a few of which admit a tendency to favor <em>in camera </em>review of witnesses\u2019 statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-6\">Nor is the State\u2019s reliance on <em>Zaal </em>persuasive. Although inspection for possible use in cross-examination prompted the subpoena in <em>Zaal, </em>and review of the file was a necessary prerequisite for determining its value for that purpose and, in those respects, it is similar to the case <em>sub judice, Zaal </em>is otherwise quite different factually from this case. Rather than a written statement in the possession of the prosecutor, made by a witness who has already testified, as here and in <em>Carr </em>and <em>Leonard, </em>at issue in <em>Zaal </em>was an entire file that was required to be kept by a state agency. The purpose of the review of the prior written statement is straight forward, to determine its consistency with the trial testimony. Thus, there was in <em>Carr </em>and <em>Leonard, </em>and is in this case, a \u201cparticularized need\u201d for disclosure of the statement. <em>See Dennis v. United States, </em>384 U.S. 855, 874, 86 S.Ct. 1840, 1851, 16 L.Ed.2d 973, 986 (1966), <em>quoting Pittsburgh Plate Glass v. U.S., </em>360 U.S. 395, 401, 79 S.Ct. 1237, 1241, 3 L.Ed.2d 1323, 1327 (1959). The purpose of the review of an agency file, on the other hand, is not nearly so straight forward; its focus necessarily is more general, to discover \u201cimpeachment\u201d or exculpatory information. In addition, in <em>Zaal, </em>the subject of the records, and her parents, had a privacy interest in the records. To the contrary, in this case, the officers\u2019 IAD <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>statements pertain to the very same subject and is about the same incident as the witnesses\u2019 trial testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-5\">In this case, the defendant has a particularized need for access to the officers\u2019 statements, to test the officers\u2019 trial testimony. On the other hand, the officers have been exonerated by the IAD investigation; thus, any privacy interest in their statements that may have existed is no longer applicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-6\">The State contends finally that any error in not ordering disclosure of the prior statements was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. To be sure, the petitioner was found not guilty of the attempted murder of the police officers and was convicted only of the robbery and related offenses involving the store employees. Therefore, the State assumes the correctness of its assertion that none of the convictions depended on the officers\u2019 credibility. That is not correct. The police officer\u2019s testimony, at the very least, was pertinent, and important to the identification of the petitioner as one of the robbers; Officer Smith and Corporal Hooper testified to seeing two men leave the 7-11 and enter the Pathfinder. If the jury questioned the officers\u2019 credibility, they may have chosen to believe the petitioner\u2019s account of events, that he was not involved in the robbery at all, and that the police officers\u2019 shots were unprovoked. Having found error in the failure to allow the petitioner, through counsel, to review the prior statements, we can not apply the harmless error rule in this case since it would be as inappropriate for this Court to review the statements for inconsistency as it was for the trial court to have done so. <em>See Jones, </em>297 Md. at 17, 464 A.2d at 982.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-7\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-8\">In a jury trial, judging the credibility of witnesses is entrusted solely to the jury, the trier of fact; only the jury determines whether to believe any witnesses, and which witnesses to believe. <em>See Bohnert v.

Thus, \u201cthe general rule is that it is error for the court to make remarks in the presence of the jury reflecting upon the credibility of a witness .... ,[and] [i]t is also error for the court to permit to go to the jury a statement, belief, or opinion of another person to the effect that a witness is telling the truth or lying.\u201d <em>Bohnert supra, </em>312 Md. at 277, 539 A.2d at 662 (citing <em>Elmer v. State, </em>239 Md. 1, 10-11, 209 A.2d 776, 781-82 (1965)) and (citing <em>Thompson v. Phosphate Works, </em>178 Md. 305, 317-319, 13 A.2d 328, 334-35 (1940)); <em>American Stores v. Herman, </em>166 Md. 312, 314-315, 171 A. 54, 55-6 (1934). <em>See United Rys. Co. v. Carneal, </em>110 Md. 211, 232-233, 72 A. 771, 775 (1909), in which the Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b352-4\">\u201cIt is undoubtedly true that a trial judge because of his high and authoritative position should be exceedingly careful in any remarks made by him during the progress of a trial either in passing upon evidence or ruling upon prayers, and should carefully refrain, either directly or indirectly, from giving expression to an opinion upon the existence or not of any fact, which should be left to the finding of the jury.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b352-5\">Similar sentiments were expressed in <em>Jefferson-El v. State, </em>330 Md. 99, 106, 622 A.2d 737, 741 (1993) (citations omitted):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b352-6\">\u201cIt is because judges occupy a distinguished and decisive position that they are required to maintain high standards of conduct.... Their conduct during a trial has a direct bearing on whether a defendant will receive a fair trial because their opinion or manifestations thereof usually will significantly impact the jury\u2019s verdict. In addition, if the defendant has elected to be tried by a jury, it is the province of that jury to decide the guilt or innocence of the defendant.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b353-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>In this case, the petitioner\u2019s credibility, as contrasted with that of the officers, was extremely important. The petitioner\u2019s defense at trial was the exact opposite of the State\u2019s case, that he was not involved in the robbery at all and his involvement in the shooting was only as a victim. As we have seen, the petitioner testified that, while he drove Tyrone Glover to the 7-11, he neither played a role in the robbery, nor was aware that one was taking place. According to the petitioner, Glover robbed the store, without his knowledge, as he waited outside and made some phone calls. The petitioner further testified that, as he was leaving the 7-11 parking lot, the officers began firing at his truck. He denied that he or Glover returned the fire. In fact, the petitioner stated that he did not have a gun and that, although he got out of the Pathfinder with his hands in the air, Officer Smith and Corporal Hooper shot him anyway.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-4\">During trial, as previously reported, after informing the petitioner that it would do so, the trial court informed the jury about the IAD investigation, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b353-5\">\u201c[Ljadies and gentlemen of the jury, it\u2019s come out in this case that two matters are going on here. First, there is this case that is for you to consider; and secondly, there\u2019s the internal investigation by the police department which takes place every time a police officer fires his weapon. Just so there\u2019s no issue in this case, I have precluded evidence of the Internal Affairs investigation thus far. We\u2019re now into it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b353-6\">\u201cI will tell you the Internal Affairs investigation cleared the two police officers. I will tell you that I have examined the two statements that were made by the two police officers to the Internal Affairs people and have found nothing in there that is exculpatory in this ease. And for that reason neither the investigation nor those statements will be coming into this case. But now that the issue has been opened, I want the issue to be fully presented to you.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b353-7\">Later, when the jury inquired as to the meaning of \u201cexculpatory,\u201d the court informed it that exculpatory is defined as \u201cfree <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>from guilt____the opposite of guilty.\u201d Thus, in addition to informing the jury of the IAD investigation, the trial court advised it that that investigation had \u201ccleared\u201d the police officers, who were important witnesses against the petitioner, that the officers had given statements to the IAD about the incident that was the subject of the trial, and that the court had read the statements and found nothing in them to exculpate the petitioner. This occurred prior to the petitioner testifying. In so doing, and certainly under the circumstances, the court commented on, and, indeed, resolved a credibility issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-6\">The first objection that the petitioner lodged on this point was to the court\u2019s answer to the jury\u2019s question. Conceding the timeliness of that objection, the State argues that, because the answer to the jury\u2019s question was correct, the petitioner\u2019s failure to object when the court initially addressed the jury on the subject constituted a waiver of any error that may have been committed at that time. The State also maintains that any error in the court\u2019s \u201cinstructions\u201d was harmless because the petitioner was not convicted of any crime as to which the police officers\u2019 testimony was crucial.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-7\">We hold that the petitioner\u2019s objection to the court\u2019s \u201cinstructions\u201d <footnotemark>9</footnotemark> was timely, pursuant to Maryland Rule 4-325(e), which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-8\">\u201c(e) Objection. No .party may assign as error the giving or the failure to give an instruction unless the party objects on the record promptly after the court instructs the jury, stating distinctly the matter to which the party objects and the grounds of the objection. Upon request of any party, the court shall receive objections out of the hearing of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>jury. An appellate court, on its own initiative or on the suggestion of a party, may however take cognizance of any plain error in the instructions, material to the rights of the defendant, despite a failure to object.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b355-4\">It is true of course that the petitioner did not object when the court initially told the jury of the IAD investigation and of its conclusion that the police officers were vindicated, and that their statements were consistent with their trial testimony. He did object, however, when the jury sought clarification. This situation is similar to what occurred in <em>Dawkins v. State, </em>313 Md. 638, 641, 547 A.2d 1041, 1042 (1988), where we held an objection to a jury instruction was preserved under the following circumstances:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b355-5\">\u201cFollowing the evidentiary portion of the trial, the court instructed the jury on the elements of possession under \u00a7 287(a) and (d). The instruction omitted any reference to knowledge being an element of the offenses. Before the jury retired to deliberate, defense counsel objected to the instructions on grounds unrelated to the issue before us. After the start of its deliberations, the jury sought reinstruction on the elements of possession. At that time, defense counsel asked the judge to instruct the jury that knowledge is an element of possession. The judge declined, ruling that knowledge is not an element of the possession offenses under \u00a7 287. The judge\u2019s reinstruction made no reference to knowledge, and it was objected to on this ground.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b355-6\">(Footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b355-7\">We have already held that the error in refusing to allow the petitioner, through counsel, to review the prior statements of the officers was prejudicial. In addition, we conclude that the trial court\u2019s error in commenting on the credibility of the witnesses was prejudicial.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-8\">\n<em>JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS REVERSED.

As the petitioner points out, however, notwithstanding that the request was made during the cross examination of Corporal Hooper, it, like the court\u2019s ruling, encompassed both statements and, more important, the court treated the request as timely. <em>See </em>Maryland Rule 8-131(a), which, as relevant, states, \"Ordinarily, the appellate court will not decide any other issue unless it plainly appears by the record to have been raised in or decided by the trial court, but the Court may decide such an issue if necessary or desirable to guide the trial court or to avoid the expense and delay of another appeal.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b343-7\">. 20 V.S.A. \u00a7 1923(d) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b343-8\">\"(d) Records of the office of internal investigation shall be confidential, except:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b343-9\">\"(1) The state police advisory commission shall, at any one time, have full and free access to such records; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AEb\">\"(2) The commissioner shall deliver such materials from the records of the office of internal investigation as may be necessary to appropriate prosecutorial authorities having jurisdiction; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AS1\">\"(3) The state police advisory commission shall, in its discretion, be entitled to such authorities as it may deem appropriate, or to the public, or to both, to ensure that proper action is taken in each case.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b344-5\">. The State asserts that the petitioner\u2019s access to the IAD statements is regulated by the Maryland Public Information Act, Maryland Code (1984, 1995 Repl.Vol., 1997 Supp.), \u00a7\u00a7 10-611 to 10-630 of the State Government Article. What we are here concerned with is a trial right, not pre-trial discovery. What the petitioner seeks is effective cross examination of a prosecution witness, hoping to uncover inconsistencies in his trial testimony, and material with which to do so. The trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>right arises when the witness testifies. The petitioner simply is not able to utilize, in a timely and meaningful manner, the Public Information Act. Moreover, were that to be the only recourse, it is likely that trials will seriously be impacted.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b354-9\">. It is doubtful that the court's initial comments to the jury concerning the IAD investigation are \"instructions\u201d as contemplated by Maryland Rule 4-325(c). That Rule provides: \"The court may, and at the request of any party shall, instruct the jury as to the applicable law and the extent to which the instructions are binding....\u201d The court\u2019s comments addressed the credibility of the parties; they advised the jury of other proceedings and the result of those proceedings, the latter of which had a direct bearing on the credibility of the witnesses.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b356-6\">RAKER, Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"ARs\">dissenting:</p>\n<p id=\"b356-7\">I would affirm the judgment of conviction and the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals and would hold that the trial court did not err in refusing to order disclosure of the police officers\u2019 statements made in connection with the Police Department Internal Affairs Investigation.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Under the circumstances presented in this case, the State was not required under <em>Jencks-Carr </em>to produce those statements because they were not in the possession of the State. Accordingly, the trial court, in ordering that the police department produce the statements, properly reviewed the statements <em>in camera, </em>and upon concluding that there was nothing inconsistent between the officers\u2019 IAD hearing testimony and their in-court testimony, properly refused to order disclosure of the statements. To the extent that the jury instruction issue was preserved for appellate review, the trial court instruction was a proper statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-8\">I agree with Judge Salmon, writing for the intermediate court, that \u201cwhen a statement is confidential under State law, developed for a non-prosecutorial purpose, and held by a division of a law enforcement agency that is not working in conjunction with the prosecutor, the State cannot be deemed to have access to, or constructive possession of, the statement [and] [h]ence, a defendant is not entitled to production of such statements under the <em>Jenckss-Carr </em>rule.\u201d <em>Robinson v. State, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>117 Md.App. 253, 257, 699 A.2d 570, 572 (1997). Because the prosecution does not have access to these records, the officers\u2019 statements were not within the possession of the prosecutor and thus were not subject to discovery by the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-5\">All parties agree that <em>Brady </em>is not at issue in this-case, and that Petitioner does not contend that the State failed to provide him with exculpatory <em>Brady </em>type material. Instead, the dispute as to the statements focuses solely on the issue of whether the trial judge violated the <em>Jencks-Carr </em>rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-6\">The Jencks Act, codified at 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3500 (1994), clarified and limited the Supreme Court\u2019s holding in <em>Jencks v. United States, </em>353 U.S. 657, 77 S.Ct. 1007, 1 L.Ed.2d 1103 (1957). Although there is no Maryland counterpart to the Jencks Act, we have consistently looked to the Act, as well as subsequent analysis and interpretation of the Act, for guidance. <em>See Bruce v. State, </em>318 Md. 706, 724-26, 569 A.2d 1254, 1263-64 (1990); <em>Jones v.

As the Court of Special Appeals pointed out, in order for a defendant to receive a witness\u2019s prior statement under the Jencks Act, the defendant must establish the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b357-10\">1. the witness must testify on direct examination;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b357-11\">2. defense counsel must request the statement;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b358-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>3. the statement must qualify as a discoverable statement under the Jencks Act;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b358-5\">4. the statement must relate to the subject matter of the witness\u2019s testimony; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b358-6\">5. the statement must be in the possession of the prosecution.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b358-7\"><em>Robinson, </em>117 Md.App. at 267-68, 699 A.2d at 578. The focus of the parties\u2019 argument in this case is the fifth requirement, <em>i.e., </em>whether the statement is in the possession of the prosecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-8\">The majority holds that the statements in question are in possession of the prosecution. The majority reasons that because the IAD is part of the police, its records are in the possession of the police for the purposes of <em>Jencks-Carr. </em>Maj. op. at 308. The majority continues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b358-9\">And if the police is an arm of the prosecution, it follows that the records are also constructively in the possession of the prosecution; records in the possession of the police are not rendered not in possession simply because they are made confidential and are not, on that account, shared with, or readily available to, the prosecution.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b358-10\"><em>Id. </em>The trial court and the Court of Special Appeals found otherwise. I agree with those courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-11\">While county police are ordinarily part of the investigatory arm of the State, this is not true as to all divisions of the police department. <em>Robinson, </em>117 Md.App. at 273, 699 A.2d at 581. The Court of Special Appeals noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b358-12\">The Prince George\u2019s County Police Department cannot be viewed as a monolith\u2014it has divisions that, at least for some purposes, are separate and distinct. Under such circumstances, the State\u2019s Attorney\u2019s Office does not constructively possess all statements held by all divisions of the police department. To know if the State constructively possesses a document, it must be determined whether the division of the police department that holds the document is working in concert with the prosecutor. If so, the State can be deemed to have access to, or constructive possession of, the docu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>ment. <em>Butler v. State, </em>107 Md.App. 345, 359-60, 667 A.2d 999 (1995); <em>see Trevino, </em>556 F.2d at 1272; <em>Dansker, </em>537 F.2d at 61 (statements possessed by the F.B.I. are considered to be in the possession of the prosecutorial arm of the federal government). In contrast, if there is no evidence that the two entities are working in tandem, the State cannot be deemed to have constructive possession of any documents in the other entity\u2019s control. <em>See Bruce v. State, </em>318 Md. at 726, 569 A.2d 1254; <em>see also United States v.

In interpreting whether under <em>Jencks </em>a statement is in possession of the government, courts distinguish between the <em>prosecutorial </em>arms of the government and other government departments. <em>See United States v. Trevino, </em>556 F.2d 1265, 1271 (5 th Cir.1977) (a statement in possession of the United States means the prosecutorial division of the government); <em>see also United States v.

Canniff, </em>521 F.2d 565, 573 (2d Cir.1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b359-6\">In this case, the State was not required to produce the statement of the police officer because the statement was not in the possession of the prosecutor\u2019s office, nor was the statement one to which the prosecutor had ready access. The statement was confidential under State law; it was prepared for non-prosecutorial purposes by a division of the police department that was not working in conjunction or in tandem with the prosecutor; and most importantly, the statement was not available to the prosecutor. Accordingly, under the <em>Jencks-Carr </em>rule, the State\u2019s Attorney did not have possession of the document.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>In <em>State v. Roy, 151 Vt. 17, 557 A.2d 884 (1989), habeas corpus denied, </em>907 F.2d 385 (2d Cir.1990), the Supreme Court of Vermont addressed the issue of whether statements given by police officers in an internal affairs investigation conducted by the Department of Public Safety were considered statements in possession, custody or control of the prosecution. Roy, charged with assaulting the state trooper who arrested him, sought the trooper\u2019s personnel file. The file was compiled by the office of internal investigation within the Vermont Department of Public Safety. The Department of Public Safety was created by 20 V.S.A. \u00a7 1923(b) \u201cto conduct investigations of allegations of misconduct by members of the Department of Public Safety, including the state police.\u201d <em>Id. 557 </em>A.2d at 893. Under the statute, the requested records were confidential. <em>Id. </em>The Vermont Supreme Court concluded that the intent of the statute was that the covered records not be subject to disclosure except for statutory purposes, leading the court to find that the statute created a form of evidentiary privilege. <em>Id. </em>The court held that because of the confidentiality provision of \u00a7 1923(b), the requested information was not within the control or possession of the prosecution and thus, was not discoverable. <em>Id. </em>at 893-94. The court further rejected the defendant\u2019s claim that due process required that he have access to the information. The court reasoned that, under the circumstances of that case, to require the prosecutor to disclose the information would put the prosecution in \u201cthe untenable position of facing, an obligation to disclose a file that it did not have and was unable to obtain.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 894. The court concluded that the proper procedure for the defendant to follow to attempt to obtain the records was to cause a subpoena to be issued to the Department of Public Safety. <em>Id. </em>at 895.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-5\">I agree with the <em>Roy </em>court that a conclusion that records are privileged or confidential does not end the inquiry. Simply because records may be privileged or confidential does not provide an absolute shield from disclosure. Cases may certainly arise where the defendant\u2019s due process rights will require access to privileged or confidential information. As in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number><em>Roy, </em>the proper procedure for the defendant in the instant case would have been to cause a subpoena to issue to the police department to produce the requested record. <em>See Pennsylvania v. Ritchie, </em>480 U.S. 39, 107 S.Ct. 989, 94 L.Ed.2d 40 (1987); <em>Goldsmith v. State, </em>337 Md. 112, 651 A.2d 866 (1995); Md. Rules 4-264\u20144-266. The police department and the prosecutor do not have the same interests, and by issuing a subpoena to the police department, the department\u2019s position may be stated directly. <em>See Roy, </em>557 A.2d at 895.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-5\">\n<em>In Camera Review</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b361-6\">The majority rejects an <em>in camera </em>review procedure on the grounds that even though the federal case law states that <em>in camera </em>review is the usual procedure in these cases, our own cases are at odds with the federal cases. Maj. op. at 312. As the majority recognizes, Maryland courts have looked to the Jencks Act and the cases interpreting the Act for guidance in interpreting the development of the <em>Jencks-Carr </em>rule and its ramifications. The federal cases hold that the proper procedure is usually <em>in camera </em>review. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Boyd, </em>53 F.3d 631, 634 (4th Cir.1995); <em>United States v. Lopez, </em>6 F.3d 1281, 1288-89 (7th Cir.1993); <em>United States v. Marshall, </em>985 F.2d 901, 907-08 (7 th Cir.1993); <em>see also </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3500(c) (contemplating <em>in camera </em>review when the government claims that discovery does not relate to the witness\u2019s direct testimony). An in-camera review is consistent with the procedure endorsed by this Court in <em>Zaal v. State, </em>326 Md. 54, 87, 602 A.2d 1247, 1263-64 (1992). In <em>Zaal, </em>this Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AE_\">In cases in which access to confidential and/or sensitive records is sought by a defendant and which will be resolved based on credibility considerations, because of which, the trial court determines the \u2018need to inspect\u2019 threshold has been crossed, <em>the court may elect to review the records alone, </em>to conduct the review in the presence of counsel, or to permit review by counsel alone, as officers of the court, subject to such restrictions as the court requires to protect the records\u2019 confidentiality. Which option the court chooses must depend on various factors, including the degree of sensitivity of the material to be inspected; the strength of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>the showing of the \u2018need to inspect\u2019; whether the information sought is readily identifiable; considerations of judicial economy, etc. The greater the \u2018need to inspect\u2019 showing, <em>ie., </em>as here, where it is self-evident, and the less sensitive the information, for example, the more likely the records will be reviewed jointly by the court and counsel or by counsel as officers of the court.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b362-5\"><em>Id., </em>602 A.2d at 1263-64 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b362-6\">In this case, the trial court reviewed the statements <em>in camera </em>and determined that there was nothing contradictory in them. The court did not err in conducting the <em>in camera </em>review, nor did the court abuse its discretion in refusing to order defense access to the statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-7\">\n<em>Harmless Error</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b362-8\">Assuming error <em>arguendo, </em>the failure to provide Jencks material is subject to a harmless error analysis. <em>See Goldberg v. United States, </em>425 U.S. 94, 117 n. 21, 96 S.Ct. 1338, 1348 n. 21, 47 L.Ed.2d 603 (1976); <em>United States v. Gonzalez, </em>110 F.3d 936, 943 (2d Cir.1997); <em>Lopez, </em>6 F.3d at 1289; <em>United States v. Susskind, </em>4 F.3d 1400, 1406 (6th Cir.1993); <em>United States v. Brumel-Alvarez, </em>991 F.2d 1452, 1457, 1464 (9 th Cir.1992); <em>United States v. Lam Kwong-Wah, </em>924 F.2d 298, 310-11 (D.C.Cir.1991); <em>Moeckly, </em>769 F.2d at 463; <em>United States v. Bruton, </em>647 F.2d 818, 827-28 (8th Cir.1981); <em>United States v. Gaston, </em>608 F.2d 607, 611-12 (5th Cir.1979); <em>see also Kanaras, </em>54 Md.App. at 574, 460 A.2d at 65; <em>see generally </em>Moore\u2019s Federal Practice \u00a7 626.2.07 (3d ed.1997). Instead of reversing and remanding for a new trial, this Court, finding error, should apply a harmless error analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-9\">The majority reverses the judgment of conviction and remands this case for a new trial. Maj. op. at 317. The majority relies on <em>Commonwealth v. French, </em>396 Pa.Super. 436, 578 A.2d 1292 (1990), <em>order affirmed, </em>531 Pa. 42, 611 A.2d 175 (1992), a Pennsylvania intermediate appellate court decision, as support for its decision. Maj. ,op. at 305-06. The majority stops short in its discussion of the case, simply noting that \u201cthe intermediate appellate court held that the state<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>ments the officers made to IAD should have been disclosed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In <em>French, </em>however, the Pennsylvania court did not reverse the conviction and remand for a new trial; instead, the court held that the error in the case is properly subject to a harmlessness analysis. <em>French, </em>578 A.2d at 1301. The court concluded that the interests of justice and relevant Pennsylvania case law required the court to allow defense counsel an opportunity to argue the merits of the issue to the trial judge who presided over the case; the trial judge then could determine the value of the prior statements to the defense after the benefit of hearing defense argument after inspection of the statements. <em>Id. </em>578 A.2d at 1301-02. Accordingly, the court remanded the case \u201cto the trial court for an evidentiary hearing on whether the court\u2019s failure to allow defense access to the Commonwealth witnesses\u2019 statements constituted harmless error.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1302. Given the majority\u2019s determination of error in the instant case, this Court should do no less.' Assuming error, if this Court declines to review the statement for harmless error, the Court should at least remand this case to the trial court for a harmlessness analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-4\">Judge CHASANOW and Judge SMITH have authorized me to state that they join in the views expressed herein.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b356-9\">. On the preservation issue, I would hold that the issue as to Officer Smith's statement under <em>Jencks-Carr </em>was not preserved for appellate review. Counsel did not request production of the statement following the officer\u2019s direct testimony and he obviously had no desire to use the statement for cross-examination purposes of that witness.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
