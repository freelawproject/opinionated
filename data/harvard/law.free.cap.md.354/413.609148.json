Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b453-9\">Rio Vista Plaza is a privately owned trailer park community located in Lothian, Maryland. The appellee, Charles Shoe-make (Shoemake), is the owner of Rio Vista Plaza. One of the four streets in the trailer park is Jeannie\u2019s Court. Within a few feet from this street and immediately in front of one of the trailer homes is a square metal plate which covers an underground compartment that contained valves previously used for water supply and regulation in the trailer park.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-10\">Around midnight on September 15, 1996, Gerald Tucker, one of the appellants, and Keith Hoffman, both police officers with the Anne Arundel County Police Department, were dispatched to one of the trailer homes on Jeannie\u2019s Court in response to a domestic dispute. Officer Tucker parked his police car on the street, got out of the car, and began walking toward the trailer home. Officer Tucker said that the lighting in the area was \u201cminimal.\u201d He was carrying his flashlight, but he did not turn it on for his own protection. On deposition Officer Tucker explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b453-11\">\u201cI\u2019m using officer-survival techniques going on a violent domestic, being cognizant of staying out of any light if there is any and making a tactical approach, staying out of the fatal funnel.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b453-12\">\u201cQ I take it from your comments that your training tells you that it is preferable and desirable to remain outside of any sources of light when you\u2019re approaching a domestic call like this or a potentially violent call; is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b454-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>\u201cA Our training teaches us to stay out of the fatal funnel, not a source of light but the fatal funnel, in other words the kill zone.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b454-4\">As Officer Tucker walked from the street onto the grass covered common area between the street and the trailer home, he unknowingly stepped on the m\u00e9tal cover. The cover gave way, and he fell into the underground valve compartment. Officer Tucker describes the incident as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b454-5\">\u201cI parked my vehicle on the paved surface outside the Trailer. I exited my vehicle and, from the street, unknowingly stepped on the metal cover of a manhole ditch. I immediately felt the cover twist and give way under me because it was not properly seated on the lip of the hole. Although I was in excellent physical condition at the time of the accident, ... I was unable to keep my balance from this unexpected hazard. As a result, I fell into the manhole and the heavy steel cover fell on my neck and back area.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Apn\">The morning following his fall Officer Tucker returned to the site and saw children\u2019s toys in the underground valve compartment. He states that Darla Sipe, the manager of the Rio Vista Plaza, told, him that morning that \u201c \u2018the manhole has been there at the location for a long time and kids are always playing in the manhole without the cover on top,\u2019 \u201d and that she had \u201c \u2018told Charles Shoemake ... on numerous prior occasions that the manhole cover posed a serious danger to kids and people may fall into the manhole and injure themselves.\u2019 \u201d Officer Tucker further stated that the manager told him that \u201c \u2018Mr. Shoemake did not consider the manhole to be a danger [and] she could not understand why Mr. Shoemake had not already secured the cover since the valves in the manhole were already moved to another building across the street.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"ACq\">Officer Tucker was injured by the fall and states that according to his doctors he will not be able to return to police duties.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-6\">II. Procedural History</p>\n<p id=\"b454-7\">Officer Tucker and the other appellant, his wife, Darlene Tucker, filed suit in the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>County against Shoemake d/b/a Rio Vista Plaza, alleging negligence, breach of duty to warn, gross negligence, and loss of consortium.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-5\">Shoemake moved for summary judgment on the grounds that the Tuckers\u2019 claims are barred by the Fireman\u2019s Rule and that the Tuckers failed to produce legally sufficient evidence of Shoemake\u2019s negligence. The Tuckers opposed the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-6\">At the hearing on the motion in the circuit court Shoemake stated that \u201cobviously the primary basis for the motion is the fireman\u2019s rule.\u201d The court entered summary judgment in favor of Shoemake, reasoning that although there was evidence that Shoemake knew of the recurrent problem with the metal cover, he did not know that Officer Tucker would be coming onto the property on that particular night and, therefore, Shoemake had no opportunity to warn Officer Tucker of the dangerous condition. Specifically, the court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b455-7\">\u201cThis is not an issue of premises liability. In that context, it is a public policy argument with regard to public safety officers.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b455-8\">\u201cIn this case, for the sake of brevity, the owner of this property has no duty to make the premises safe for the police officer to come onto the property. There\u2019s no dispute of fact that the owner did not know that the officer was coming onto the property.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b455-9\">\u201cIn this case, the owner did not create the danger or possibly, arguably, created the danger. They knew of a recurrent problem with the cover on this\u2014I think it says it was for valves and things of that nature. It\u2019s not a manhole, but it was a plate.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b455-10\">\u201cThey knew of a recurrent problem, but there\u2019s no evidence that they knew of the problem on this day. For the purposes of this discussion, I will deem that the recurrent nature of the defect is adequate to put them\u2014have some obligation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b455-11\">\u201cWhere we have a problem is this Defendant did not know that the officer would be on the premises and, therefore, this Defendant had no opportunity to warn the officer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>of the defective condition that it knew of or knew repeated itself.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b456-4\">\u201cThe knowledge requirement of the Defendant is knowledge of the defective condition and knowledge of the entry or actual entry of the police officer on the premises that has not been shown in this case, and regretfully I will grant the motion for summary judgment in favor of the Defendant, and this case is closed statistically.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b456-5\">After the Tuckers unsuccessfully moved to alter or amend the judgment, they timely appealed to the Court of Special Appeals. Prior to consideration of this matter by the Court of Special Appeals, this Court issued a writ of certiorari on our own motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-6\">The following questions are presented for review:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b456-7\">\u201c1. Whether the court erred in ruling that the fireman\u2019s rule barred Officer Tucker\u2019s action for injuries he sustained due to a dangerous condition in a negligently maintained portion of the Trailer Park held open as a public right-of-way which Tucker traversed in order to reach the site of a domestic dispute he was attempting to investigate.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b456-8\">\u201c2. Whether the court erred in failing to apply the exception to the Fireman\u2019s Rule for known dangerous conditions when it was undisputed that the defective valve plate cover which caused Officer Tucker\u2019s injury was known by Appellee Shoemake to create a dangerous and recurring condition in an area of the Trailer Park intentionally held open to pedestrians as a public right-of-way.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b456-9\">These questions may be restated as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b456-10\">\u201cDid the circuit court err in granting summary judgment on the ground that the Fireman\u2019s Rule precluded the Tuckers\u2019 recovery?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b456-11\">Both parties have interpreted the circuit court\u2019s decision to be that the Fireman\u2019s Rule bars the Tuckers\u2019 cause of action. No issue is raised as to the circuit court\u2019s analysis that the defendant did not have an opportunity to warn Officer Tucker <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>because he had no actual knowledge of the police officer\u2019s presence on the premises.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b457-5\">III. Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b457-6\">Under Maryland common law, the Fireman\u2019s Rule provides that \u201cfiremen and police officers generally cannot recover for injuries attributable to the negligence that requires their assistance.\u201d <em>Flowers v. Rock Creek Terrace Ltd. Partnership, </em>308 Md. 432, 447, 520 A.2d 361, 368 (1987).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b457-7\">\u201cA fireman or police officer may not recover if injured by the negligently created risk that was the very reason for his presence on the scene in his occupational capacity. Someone who negligently creates the need for a public safety officer will not be liable to a fireman or policeman for injuries caused by this negligence.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b457-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 447-48, 520 A.2d at 368. This public-policy grounded doctrine \u201cis based on a relationship between firemen and policemen and the public that calls on these safety officers specifically to confront certain hazards on behalf of the public.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 447, 520 A.2d at 368.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-9\">However, \u201cfiremen and policemen are not barred from recovery for all improper conduct.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 448, 520 A.2d at 368-69. For example, \u201c[njegligent acts not protected by the fireman\u2019s rule may include failure to warn the fireman of preexisting hidden dangers where there was knowledge of the danger and an opportunity to warn.\u201d <em>Id., </em>520 A.2d at 369.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-10\">This case is not one in which the Fireman\u2019s Rule applies to preclude recovery. Officer Tucker was not injured by the negligently-created risk that occasioned his presence at the trailer park. He was at the trailer park in response to a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>domestic dispute call, whereas he was injured as a result of . stepping on the allegedly improperly seated metal cover to the underground valve compartment. Thus, the negligence alleged to have caused Officer Tucker\u2019s injuries was independent and not related to the situation requiring his services as a police officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-5\"><em>See, e.g., Kocan v. Garino, </em>107 Cal.App.3d 291, 295-96, 165 Cal.Rptr. 712, 715 (1980) (reversing general demurrer sustained on the basis of the Fireman\u2019s Rule against a police officer injured by a fence that collapsed as he climbed over it while in hot pursuit of a felon; \u201c[the defendant landowner\u2019s] negligence, if such there were, in no wise created the risk which was the cause of [the police officer\u2019s] presence on the property nor could it have provided, within the ambit of the fireman\u2019s rule, any occasion for [the police officer\u2019s] engagement at the time, which was instead a result of wholly independent factors not involving [the landowner]. Accordingly, while it may yet be the ease that liability will not be established in any event, its absence will not depend upon the fireman\u2019s rule, but rather upon those considerations which generally govern the relationship between possessors of real property and those who are injured on it\u201d) (citation omitted); <em>Hedberg v. Mendino, </em>218 Ill.App.3d 1087, 1091, 161 Ill.Dec. 850, 579 N.E.2d 398, 400 (1991) (reversing grant of motion to dismiss on the basis of the Fireman\u2019s Rule against a police officer injured on a defective sidewalk as he responded to a call regarding a prowler; \u201cPlaintiff was on the property to investigate a prowler and not to investigate the sidewalk. The injury arose from a cause independent of the reason plaintiff was called to the premises\u201d). <em>Cf. Schreiber v. Cherry Hill Constr. Co., </em>105 Md.App. 462, 474-75, 660 A.2d 970, 976 (applying <em>Flowers </em>in holding that the Fireman\u2019s Rule did not bar a police officer\u2019s claim for injuries suffered when, while investigating a motor vehicle accident, a. car went out of control, crossed through a flare safety line, and struck the police officer; the negligence of the driver and the contractor who constructed the curve on which the car lost control was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>independent of what necessitated the presence of the police officer), <em>cert. denied, </em>340 Md. 500, 667 A.2d 341 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b459-5\">Conversely, had Officer Tucker suffered some injury due to a negligent condition in the trailer where the domestic dispute was or had been in progress, the Fireman\u2019s Rule likely would apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-6\">Shoemake argues that \u201cthe fireman\u2019s rule should be clarified to preclude recovery by public safety officers for acts of negligence which injure them, so long as the officer is injured during the transaction of performing an obligation of his occupation,\u201d subject to certain exceptions. \u201cAny injury which occurred during [\u2018the entire transaction of responding to the call\u2019] must be within the scope of the fireman\u2019s rule.\u201d Contrary to Shoemake\u2019s \u201ctransactional approach\u201d argument, the Fireman\u2019s Rule does not preclude recovery in all cases in which a police officer is injured in the line of duty. \u201cWe reiterate ... that firemen and policemen are not barred from recovery for all improper conduct.\u201d <em>Flowers, </em>308 Md. at 448, 520 A.2d at 368-69.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-7\">This case is similar to cases holding that the Fireman\u2019s Rule is not a bar to a police officer\u2019s claim for injuries sustained when struck by a motor vehicle at the scene of an earlier motor vehicle accident to which the officer had responded. The courts consider that the police officer\u2019s injuries resulted from acts of negligence independent of the cause of the officer\u2019s presence. <em>See Schreiber, </em>105 Md.App. at 474-75, 660 A.2d at 976; <em>Wietecha v. Peoronard, </em>102 N.J. 591, 595-96, 510 A.2d 19, 21 (1986) (per curiam); <em>Duda v. Griffin, </em>165 A.D.2d 298, 300, 567 N.Y.S.2d 194, 195-96 (1991); <em>Aetna Cas. &amp; Sur. Co. v. Vierra, </em>619 A.2d 436, 439-40 (R.I.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b459-8\">Shoemake further argues that Officer Tucker assumed the risk of being injured by the manner in which he approached the domestic dispute. Because this argument does not pertain to whether the Fireman\u2019s Rule operates to preclude recovery, it is not the basis on which the circuit court granted summary judgment. Consequently, we do not consider assumption of the risk as an alternative ground in support of the judgment. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number><em>Gresser v. Anne Arundel County, </em>349 Md. 542, 552, 709 A.2d 740, 745 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b460-5\">JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR PRINCE GEORGE\u2019S COUNTY REVERSED. CASE REMANDED FOR FURTHER PROCEEDINGS. COSTS TO BE PAID BY THE APPELLEE.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b457-11\">. It may be the case that the circuit court interpreted the Fireman\u2019s Rule to be that unless the police officer can establish that the landowner knew about the dangerous condition, knew that the officer would be on the premises on that particular day, and failed to warn the officer of the dangerous condition, then otherwise the Fireman\u2019s Rule bars the plaintiffs\u2019 claim. This appears to be how Shoemake explained the operation of the Fireman\u2019s Rule to the court during the hearing on the motion for summary judgment.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
