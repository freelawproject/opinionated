Petitioner, the Board of License Commissioners for Charles County (Board), filed a show cause order and a formal protest against the renewal of respondent\u2019s license on March 6, 1997. Due to typographical errors in those documents, petitioner filed an amended protest and amended show cause order on March 13, 1997. Copies of all four documents were served upon respondent, which notified respondent of a scheduled hearing. Petitioner, however, did not publish a general public notice of the renewal hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-6\">The amended show cause order alleged that \u201cnumerous fights, stabbings, and shootings\u201d and \u201cnumerous sales of controlled dangerous substances\u201d had occurred at Toye\u2019s Inn during the preceding ten months, threatening the \u201cpeace and safety of the community.\u201d At a hearing on April 10, 1997, an assistant county attorney presented to petitioner the testimony of four peace officers with the Charles County Sheriffs Office who described incidents of illegal drug activity on the Toye\u2019s Inn property. Respondent called no witnesses on her behalf. After a unanimous vote of the Board. during a April 24, 1997, hearing, petitioner denied renewal of respondent\u2019s license in a written opinion filed May 8,1997.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-7\">Respondent sought judicial review in the Circuit Court for Charles County, which affirmed petitioner\u2019s findings of fact and conclusions. An appeal to the Court of Special Appeals followed. That court reversed the circuit court in an unreported opinion, holding that petitioner was required to provide public notification of the renewal hearing. Petitioner sought a writ of certiorari, which we granted, presenting the following issue:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b157-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>When a protest to the annual renewal of an alcoholic beverage license is initiated by a County Board of License Commissioners and served on the Licensee pursuant to Md.Code Ann., Article 2B, \u00a7 10-301(a), whether the Board is also required to publish a general public notice of the hearing in strict compliance with the provisions of Md.Code Ann., Article 2B, \u00a7\u00a7 10-202(a)(l)(i-iv) and 10-202(a-l).[<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Au3\">Under the circumstances of this case, we hold that, pursuant to the statute applicable here, publication of a general public notice is required prior to a hearing on a protest to the renewal of an alcoholic beverage license.

State, </em>337 Md. 658, 678, 655 A.2d 886, 896 (\u201cMaryland\u2019s courts have inherent power to correct agency adjudicatory determinations that are ... illegal.\u201d), <em>cert. denied, </em>514 U.S. 1111, 115 S.Ct. 1965, 131 L.Ed.2d 856 (1995); <em>Department of Natural Resources v. Linchester Sand &amp; Gravel Corp., </em>274 Md. 211, 224, 334 A.2d 514, 523 (1975) (\u201c[W]hen an agency is acting in a fact-finding capacity (quasi-judicial) the courts review the appealed conclusions by determining whether the contested decision was rendered in an illegal ... manner.\u201d); <em>Board of Liquor License Comm\u2019rs v.

If the Board[ ] ... did commit an error of law, we must [reverse its decision].\u201d). In this case, if section 10-301(a)(1) required petitioner to give public notice as described in section 10-202(a-l), then petitioner\u2019s findings of fact and conclusions, though prima facie correct, were reached through an illegal procedure and the case should be remanded for a new hearing. <em>See </em>Art. 2B, \u00a7 16-101(e)(4)(ii) (authorizing remand of the proceedings in Charles County). We turn first to the meaning of the relevant portion of section 10-301(a)(l).</p>\n<p id=\"b160-4\">\u201cThe cardinal rule of statutory interpretation is to ascertain and effectuate the intention of the legislature.\u201d <em>Oaks v. Connors, </em>339 Md. 24, 35, 660 A.2d 423, 429 (1995). Legislative intent first must be sought in the actual language of the statute. <em>Marriott Employees Fed. Credit Union v. Motor Vehicle Admin., </em>346 Md. 437, 444-45, 697 A.2d 455, 458 (1997); <em>Stanford v. Maryland Police Training &amp; Correctional Comm\u2019n, </em>346 Md. 374, 380, 697 A.2d 424, 427 (1997) (quoting <em>Tidewater v.

Weiss, </em>217 Md. 133, 136, 141 A.2d 734, 736 (1958). Furthermore, where the statutory language is plain and free from ambiguity, and expresses a definite and simple meaning, courts normally do not look beyond the words of the statute itself to determine legislative intent. <em>Marriott Employees, </em>346 Md. at 445, 697 A.2d at 458; <em>Kaczorowski v. Mayor of Baltimore, </em>309 Md. 505, 515, 525 A.2d 628, 633 (1987); <em>Hunt v. Montgomery County, </em>248 Md. 403, 414, 237 A.2d 35, 41 (1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b160-5\">We begin the interpretation of a statute by ascertaining the plain ordinary meaning of the relevant language. This Court explained in <em>Romm, </em>340 Md. at 693, 668 A.2d at 2, however, that statutory language cannot be defined by dictionary definitions alone:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b161-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>\u201cIn construing the meaning of a word in a statute, the cardinal rule is to ascertain and carry out the real legislative intention.\u201d <em>Tucker v. Fireman\u2019s Fund Insurance Co., </em>308 Md. 69, 73, 517 A.2d 730 (1986). We start by examining the language of the statute. <em>Id. </em>We are not constrained, however, by ... \u201cthe literal or usual meaning\u201d of the terms at issue. <em>Id. </em>at 75, 517 A.2d 730. \u201cA dictionary is a starting point in the work of statutory construction, but not necessarily the end.\u201d <em>Morris v. Prince George\u2019s County, </em>319 Md. 597, 606, 573 A.2d 1346 (1990).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b161-4\">We noted in <em>Tucker, </em>308 Md. at 73, 75, 517 A.2d at 731, 732, that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b161-5\">[t]he primary source of legislative intent is, of course, the language of the statute itself____ Of course, where statutory provisions are clear and unambiguous, no construction or clarification is needed or permitted, it being the rule that a plainly worded statute must be construed without forced or subtle interpretations designed to extend or limit the scope of its operation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b161-7\">... We ... recognize the rule that where a statute is plainly susceptible of more than one meaning and thus contains an ambiguity, courts consider not only the literal or usual meaning of the words, but their meaning and effect in light of the setting, the objectives and purpose of the enactment. In such circumstances, the court, in seeking to ascertain legislative intent, may consider the consequences resulting from one meaning rather than another, and adopt that construction which avoids an illogical or unreasonable result, or one which is inconsistent with common sense. [Citations omitted.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b161-8\"><em>See also Farris v. State, </em>351 Md. 24, 28-29, 716 A.2d 237, 240 (1998) (\u201cIf the language of a statute is ambiguous, we consider the usual meaning of the words in the context of the setting and the objectives and purposes expressed by the Legislature.\u201d). In <em>Tracey v. Tracey, </em>328 Md. 380, 614 A.2d 590 (1992), it was argued that we should strictly interpret the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>language of an alimony statute according to its literal meaning. We disagreed, noting that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b162-4\">While the language of the statute is the primary source for determining legislative intention, the plain meaning rule of construction is not absolute; rather, the statute must be construed reasonably with reference to the purpose, aim, or policy of the enacting body. The Court will look at the larger context, including the legislative purpose, within which statutory language appears.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b162-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 387, 614 A.2d at 594 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b162-6\">We have also noted that when \u201cthere is a lack of relevant legislative history,[<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>] we must rely substantially on the language of the statutes in the context of the goals and objectives they seek to achieve.\u201d <em>Subsequent Injury Fund v. Teneyck, </em>317 Md. 626, 632, 566 A.2d 94, 97 (1989) (citing <em>Kaczorowski, </em>309 Md. at 513-16, 525 A.2d at 632-33). Finally, this Court, with regard to construing various provisions of Article 2B, has said that \u201c[t]he proper rule of construction is that all parts of ... an article of the Code ... must be read together as they form part of a general system. And Article 2B itself has been so read by this Court. <em>Baltimore Liquor Stores Assn. v. Comm\u2019rs, </em>171 Md. 426, at page 431, 189 A. 209.\u201d <em>State v. Petrushansky, </em>183 Md. 67, 71, 36 A.2d 533, 535 (1944) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b162-7\">The circuit court found that the words \u201cheard and determined\u201d in section 10-301(a)(l) referred only to the procedures governing the original application hearing itself, namely, the procedures that addressed the criteria listed in section 10-202(a)(2) that an alcoholic beverage licensing board must find do not exist prior to approving an original license application. The circuit court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ac1\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>[Section 10-301(a)(l)] says heard and determined. Heard to me contemplates the procedure associated with the presentation of evidence as such before the board.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b163-4\">Determined to me means that the board is to act as it would in considering that evidence and making its determinations as contemplated by paragraph [(a)(2)(i)] and following of section 10-202.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b163-5\">As relevant to this appeal, \u201chear,\u201d the present tense of \u201cheard,\u201d means \u201c5. to give a formal, official, or judicial hearing to (something); consider officially, as a judge, sovereign, teacher, assembly, etc.: <em>to hear a case. </em>6. to take or listen to the evidence or testimony of (someone): <em>to hear the defendant.\u201d </em>The Random House Dictionary of the English Language 654 (unabr. ed.1983). \u201cHearing\u201d is defined as \u201c3. opportunity to be heard: <em>to grant a hearing. </em>4. an instance or a session in which testimony and arguments are presented, esp. before an official, as a judge in a lawsuit.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cDetermine\u201d means \u201c7. <em>Chiefly Law. </em>to put an end to; terminate. 8. to lead or bring (a person) to a decision. 9. to decide upon.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 393. These definitions provide no real guidance in interpreting what the legislature meant in section 10\u2014301(a)(1) by the phrase \u201cheard and determined\u201d; the words are open to various legitimate but differing interpretations. Accordingly, we turn to the general policy considerations behind the licensing provisions and the meaning of the phrase within the context of the entire licensing and renewal provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-6\">Maryland Code (1957, 1998 Repl.Vol. ), Article 2B, section 1-101 states, in general terms, the policy behind Article 2B and the powers granted to local licensing boards:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b163-7\">(a) <em>Regulation </em>necessary.\u2014(1) It is the policy of the State of Maryland that it is necessary to regulate and control the ... sale ... of alcoholic beverages within this State ... to obtain respect and obedience to law and to foster and promote temperance.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b163-8\">(2) It is the legislative intent that <em>that policy will be carried out in the best public interest </em>by empowering ... the various local boards of license commissioners and- liquor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>control boards ... with sufficient authority to administer and enforce the provisions of this article.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-4\">(3) <em>The restrictions, regulations, provisions and penalties contained in this article are for the protection, health, welfare and safety of the people of this State.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-5\">(b) <em>Powers </em>authorized.\u2014(1) It continues to be the policy of this State to authorize the exercise of the powers and authority provided by this article <em>... to promote the general welfare of its citizens </em>by controlling the sale and distribution of alcoholic beverages. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b164-6\">We have noted that the power of the Legislature to regulate alcoholic beverages through Article 2B derives from the State\u2019s police powers to protect the public welfare. <em>Erwin &amp; Shafer, Inc. v. Pabst Brewing Co., </em>304 Md. 302, 309 n. 8, 498 A.2d 1188, 1191 n. 8 (1985) (\u201cIt is uncontroverted that a state\u2019s right to control and regulate liquor is founded in its police power, granted to it under the twenty first amendment to the U.S. Constitution.\u201d (citing <em>Dundalk Liquor Co. v. Tawes, </em>201 Md. 58, 66, 92 A.2d 560, 563 (1952))); <em>Payson St. Neighborhood Club v. Board of Liquor License Comm\u2019rs, </em>204 Md. 278, 284-85, 103 A.2d 847, 850 (1954) (\u201cThe foundation of the power of the Legislature to regulate the sale of alcoholic beverages and the grant of licenses ... is, of course, the police power.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b164-7\">This Court, in dicta, also has explained the general policy within Article 2B to closely regulate the activities of local alcoholic beverage licensing boards:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-8\">Rather than providing broad general guidelines, the General Assembly has chosen to closely control by statute even the more detailed aspects of the alcoholic beverages industry. This close regulation is perhaps partly due to the fact that, unlike other regulated areas, there is not a single agency that administers the alcoholic beverages law, but rather numerous local boards that are charged with its enforcement. Regardless of the reason for its enactment, <em>the result of such a comprehensive statutory scheme is that the authority of the administering agencies necessarily is more </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number><em>circumscribed than the typical administrative body. </em>The Liquor Board thus differs fundamentally from those agencies to which the legislature more generously delegates the particulars of a regulatory scheme.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b165-4\"><em>Board of Liquor License Comm'rs v. Hollywood Prods., </em>344 Md. 2, 13, 684 A.2d 837, 842-43 (1996) (emphasis added); <em>see also Baines v. Board of Liquor License Comm\u2019rs, </em>100 Md. App. 136, 141, 640 A.2d 232, 235 (1994) (noting that alcoholic beverage licensing boards must \u201cscrupulously\u201d follow the statutory scheme that empowers them).</p>\n<p id=\"b165-5\">The language of section 10-301 clearly works in conjunction with section 10-202. Section 10-301(a)(l) provides that if a protest to a license renewal has been filed, the protest \u201cshall be heard and determined as in the case of original applications,\u201d original applications being governed by section 10-202. Section 10-202(a-l) indicates that hearings in Charles County on protested license renewals must be preceded by public notice. Section 10-202(a)(l)(iv) requires that \u201cany person shall be heard on either side of the question\u201d of renewal. Two criteria that an alcoholic beverage licensing board must examine at a protested license renewal hearing include whether the facility covered by the license being considered for renewal is \u201cnot necessary for the accommodation of the public\u201d or would \u201cunduly disturb the peace of the residents of the neighborhood in which the place of business is ... located.\u201d \u00a7 10-202(a)(2)(i). In Charles County, section 10-202(g) also allows petitioner to consider \u201cthe general reputation of the ... licensee and of the place of business and of the people who congregate therein.\u201d Section 10-202, therefore, contemplates that when protests are filed, a hearing will be held in which citizens from the neighboring areas may testify either for or against a license renewal, not a proceeding in which only the protestant, in this case the Board, and the licensee may call witnesses on their own behalf. The intent of section 10-301 to incorporate by reference the original application process described in section 10-202 into a renewal protest proceeding reflects that both procedures address the relationship between <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>the local community and the facility operating with ah alcoholic beverage license.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-4\">Petitioner, and other alcoholic beverage licensing boards, generally must provide the opportunity for public testimony in order to fully address these issues. Petitioner apparently recognized this need for public testimony at protested renewal hearings when it adopted its own Rule 2.106 (1992), which states: \u201c[t]he general public and representatives of the news media are encouraged and invited to attend <em>all </em>hearings----\u201d (Emphasis added.) When notice of a hearing is published properly, petitioner will be able to hear the comments and testimony of interested persons from the general public and incorporate them into its decision-making process. If notice is published, but no members of the general public appear and present evidence, petitioner at least can infer that there are no supporters or opponents of the renewal. In other words, the public is unconcerned. If there is no public notice, licensing boards likely will have no evidence generated by the general public and would not be able to imply any interest, or lack of interest, by the public.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-7\">Alcoholic beverage licensing boards are charged with considering public accommodation and public disturbance issues. We believe, therefore, that the requirement that renewal applications, when protests exist, \u201cbe heard and determined as in the case of original applications,\u201d requires publication of notice. Publication is the method devised by the Legislature to ensure consideration of the public\u2019s interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-8\">This Court noted, in dicta, the necessity of examining the public interest during hearings on protests to alcoholic beverage licenses in <em>Williams v. Associated Professors of Loyola College, </em>257 Md. 316, 337-38, 263 A.2d 5, 15-16 (1970). In construing the \u201cheard and determined as in the case of original applications\u201d language in the renewal statute, we quoted a <em>nisi prius </em>opinion from the Circuit Court <em>for </em>Baltimore City, <em>Cargill v. Board of Liquor License Commissioners, </em>(May 25, 1944) (Dennis, C.J.):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b167-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>\u201cPer Section 27 of the Act[, now Article 2B, section 10-301], upon the filing of a protest ... the Board must hold a hearing <em>precisely </em>as in the case of original applications. In acting upon an original application the Board shall determine the facts. If granting the license is (1) not necessary for the accommodation of the public, or (2) the operation of the business will unduly disturb the peace of the residents of the neighborhood, or (3) there are other reasons (in the discretion of the Board) the license shall be refused <em>in the public interests.[</em><footnotemark><em>4</em></footnotemark><em>] </em>Such are the rules controlling the Board and this Court.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b167-4\"><em>Id. </em>(emphasis added). Although <em>Williams </em>and <em>Cargill </em>discussed issues unrelated to the case <em>sub judice, </em>the quotation from <em>Cargill </em>indicates the importance of public input when licensing boards decide whether to renew a protested license. Public input is desirable to address, with some precision, the statutory factors protecting \u201cthe public interests.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b167-5\">The public, however, cannot testify regarding the public interest during protested renewal hearings without knowledge that renewal proceedings are to be conducted before the licensing board. Presumably, the only way a citizen would be aware of a renewal hearing without public notice would be by \u201cword of mouth,\u201d typically through the protestant or the licensee. Such a method of \u201cnotice\u201d not only would reduce the number of citizens attending the hearing to testify, but allow the parties to the proceeding to advertise the hearing only to witnesses biased toward their cause. Thus, as it must in original applications hearings, petitioner must publish general public notice of the pending protested renewal proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-6\">Finally, we address petitioner\u2019s argument that protests to renewals are more in the nature of license revocation or suspension hearings, which require only actual notice to the licensee. <em>See </em>Md.Code (1957, 1998 Repl.Vol., 1998 Cum. Supp.), Art. 2B, \u00a7\u00a7 10-401, 10-403. Licensing boards may revoke or suspend licenses if \u201cnecessary to promote the peace <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>or safety of the community,\u201d and apparently may do so without any official notice to the public. \u00a7 10-401(a)(2). Section 10-401(a), however, <em>requires </em>revocation or suspension for certain actions by the licensee or his or her employees:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b168-4\">(3) The license or permit must be revoked or suspended ... for the following causes:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b168-5\">(i) Conviction of the licensee or permittee for violation of any of the provisions of the Tax-General Article that relate to the alcoholic beverage tax or the provisions of this article;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b168-6\">(ii) Willful failure or refusal of any licensee or permittee to comply with the provisions of the Tax-General Article that relate to the alcoholic beverage tax or any provisions of this article, or any rule or regulation that may be adopted in pursuance [thereof];</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b168-7\">(iii) Making of any material false statement in any application for a license or permit;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b168-8\">(iv) Two or more convictions of one or more of the ... servants of a licensee or permittee under the provisions of this article or ... the Tax-General Article that relate to the alcoholic beverage tax ...;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b168-9\">(v) Possession upon the premises of any retail dealer ... of any alcoholic beverage upon which the tax imposed by \u00a7 5-102 of the Tax-General Article has not been paid;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b168-10\">(vi) Violation of the provisions of \u00a7 12-104 of this article [which prohibits alcoholic beverage manufacturers and wholesalers from having any business interest in an establishment that sells alcohol retail];</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b168-11\">(vii) Willful failure of any licensee or permittee to keep the records required by this article or ... the Tax-General Article ... or to allow any inspections of such records by a duly authorized person;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b168-12\">(viii) Possession of any alcoholic beverage which any licensee ... is not licensed to sell;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b168-13\">(ix) Suspension or revocation of a permit issued to any licensee or permittee by the Federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms or for conviction of violating any federal-laws relating to alcoholic beverages; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b169-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>(x) Failure to furnish bond as required by this article....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b169-4\">(4) Revocation and suspension of licenses is also authorized for such other offenses as specified in other parts of this article.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b169-5\">Thus, section 10-401 requires an alcoholic beverage licensing board to suspend or revoke a license for any of a number of specified reasons. Section 10-202(a)(2), however, requires that licensing boards reviewing protests to license renewals determine all of the listed criteria, including the criteria involving the public interest <em>and </em>those focusing on the licensee\u2019s behavior, before they may renew a protested license. Testimonial evidence by neighboring citizens, therefore, might be necessary to ascertain whether the section 10-202(a)(2) criteria that protect the community interests in renewing or denying the license exist. Notice by publication, in turn, is necessary to make the public aware of its right to be heard on those criteria at the renewal hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-6\">We therefore hold that alcoholic beverage licensing boards, hearing a protest to a license renewal under section 10-801(a)(1), must provide general notice by publication as described in section 10-202 prior to holding a protested renewal hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-7\">JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS AFFIRMED; COSTS TO BE PAID BY PETITIONER,</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b157-6\">.
