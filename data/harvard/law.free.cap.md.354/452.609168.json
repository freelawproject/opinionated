We also hold, however, that there is no negligent misrepresentation as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-10\">The petitioners, defendants in the trial court, are Ben Lewis Plumbing, Heating &amp; Air Conditioning, Inc. and related companies and their principal (collectively Lewis). The respondents are Liberty Mutual Insurance Co. and other companies of the Liberty Mutual Group (collectively Liberty). Liberty\u2019s action against Lewis was filed in February 1993 seeking the balance due for premiums on policies issued by Liberty to Lewis that provided a variety of coverages, including workers\u2019 compensation. The latter covered Lewis\u2019s activities in Maryland and in other nearby jurisdictions where Lewis also did business. The net balance on all lines claimed at trial by Liberty from Lewis was $63,725.70.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-11\">Only workers\u2019 compensation coverage for the policy period July 1, 1986, through June 30, 1987, under Policy WC-7-581-962477-046 (the Policy) is involved in the dispute between the parties. The premium on the Policy was determined by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>retrospective rating.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Liberty is a mutual insurance company, and its board of directors historically had declared dividends payable to policyholders, and, on retrospectively rated policies, dividends are credited against premium, or, if no additional premium is payable, dividends are paid in cash. The relationship between dividends for a workers\u2019 compensation policy period and losses incurred in years subsequent to the policy period based on compensable accidents that occurred during the policy period was governed by the type of plan offered by Liberty and selected by the policyholder. All of the issues in the instant matter revolve around whether Liberty, having credited Lewis with a dividend in the first adjustment of the Policy premium, could, in later adjustments and because of increased losses chargeable to the Policy period, recover back an amount equal to dividends previously paid.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-4\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b492-5\">The dispute arises out of the following facts. Lewis annually requested proposals on its insurance requirements, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>Liberty had provided Lewis\u2019s insurance for the two years preceding July 1, 1986. The workers\u2019 compensation policy for the year ending June 30, 1986, was written on a plan under which dividends paid on the first readjustment were not subject to repayment based on losses determined at later readjustments. The workers\u2019 compensation policy for that period ending June 30, 1986, is not in evidence. Part of the record, however, is a form letter prepared by Liberty and accepted by Lewis by its corporate secretary\u2019s signature that presents the dividend plan for that policy period. In relevant part it reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b493-4\">\u201cWORKERS\u2019 COMPENSATION RETENTION DIVIDEND PLAN CONFIRMATION LETTER</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AmQ\">\u201cRE: POLICY(IES) # Eff.

The third computation of dividends will be final.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b494-4\">\n<em>\u201cIn addition, adverse loss development on the second or third adjustment will not reduce any dividend previously paid to you.\u201d</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b494-5\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b494-6\">For the year beginning July 1, 1986, Liberty submitted a proposal to Lewis that included workers\u2019 compensation insurance based on Lewis\u2019s estimated payroll of $1.82 million. Liberty estimated that the minimum net premium on the Policy would be approximately $82,000 if there were no losses and the maximum net premium would be approximately $140,-000 if losses' reached or exceeded $89,600. This proposal contemplated that the coverage would be written on the \u201cRegular Variable Dividend Plan,\u201d but that plan\u2019s treatment of any dividend to policyholders was not described in the proposal.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-7\">As in the two prior years, Liberty\u2019s proposal for all lines was submitted to Lewis\u2019s corporate secretary, Sally Fink, by an employee representative of Liberty. The employee who submitted the proposal in 1986 was not a witness at trial. Ms. Fink testified that when the Liberty representative delivered the proposal, Ms. Fink asked if \u201cit was the same coverage as we\u2019d gotten. We were with them two years before that, so we could be very brief. She said, Tes.\u2019 \u201d On or about August 27, 1986, all of the policies, including the thirty-seven page Policy, were delivered to Lewis in a large binder. Also transmitted at that time was a one-page, Liberty-form, confirmation letter referencing the Policy and dated July 1, 1986. Ms. Fink testified that \u201c[o]n receipt of the binder of policies\u201d she telephoned the Liberty representative and \u201casked her if there was anything I needed to know about them. She said, \u2018No,\u2019 and she requested that I ... sign this form [the confirmation letter], and get it back to her for her files.\u201d Ms. Fink signed on behalf of Lewis next to the printed words \u201cAccepted by\u201d and returned the confirmation. That letter in relevant part reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b495-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>\u201cALL STATES WORKERS\u2019 COMPENSATION RETENTION DIVIDEND PLAN CONFIRMATION LETTER WITH REDETERMINATION</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b495-4\">\u201cRE: POLICY(IES) # WC7-581-962477-046 Eff.

The above-quoted relevant portions of the July 1, 1986 confirmation letter are, substantially verbatim, the text of an endorsement headed, \u201cDividend Redetermination Endorsement,\u201d that was part of the Policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-8\">Ms. Fink and management witnesses from Lewis acknowledged that they had read neither the dividend redetermination endorsement nor the 1986 confirmation letter. Their position was that they relied on the representations quoted above and that they were unaware of the change.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-9\">In the first retrospective adjustment of the Policy, made in June 1988, Lewis received a total credit of $94,090, but by the fourth retrospective adjustment, made in 1991, the dividend for the Policy period had been completely eliminated by charge backs. Set forth below are summaries of the accountings by Liberty at each annual adjustment of premium and of dividend.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b496-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>Summaries of Retrospective Premium and Dividend Adjustments on Policy WC7-581-962477-046 Covering Policy Period 7-1-86 to 7-1-87</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b496-5\">First Retrospective Adjustment</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b496-6\">Made in 1988</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b496-7\">Loss\u2014$8,900 (reserve)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b496-8\">Premium Adjustment Standard Audited Premium $137,537</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AIy\">First Computation Retro Premium 83,880 '</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ABb\">$53,657 credit</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AOm\">Dividend Adjustment Preliminary Dividend $ 0</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A5s\">First Computation Retro Dividend 40,423</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"An6\">40,423 credit</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ah5\">Balance to Lewis $94,080</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Aso\">Dividend not previously paid _10</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ANx\">$94,090 credit</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AfN\">Second Retrospective Adjustment</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AHj\">Made in 1989</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ABj\">Loss\u2014$33,500</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Aap\">Premium Adjustment</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AGZ\">First Computation Retro Premium $ 83,880</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A6X\">Second Computation Retro Premium 114,433</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ae2\">$30,553 debit</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ayn\">Dividend Adjustment</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AJQ\">First Computation Retro Dividend $ 40,423</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"APC\">Second Computation Retro Dividend 41,456</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Aql\">1,033 credit</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AOF\">Balance due Liberty $29,520 debit</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AV-\">(Audited premium adjusted by $120 to $137,657)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AOU\">Third Retrospective Adjustment</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AyB\">Made in 1990</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AeJ\">Loss\u2014$70,990</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b497-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>Premium Adjustment</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ANV\">Second Computation Retro Premium $114,433</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AnX\">Third Computation Retro Premium 137,537</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ApQ\">$23,104 debit</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AqN\">Dividend Adjustment</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AWb\">Second Computation Retro Divi- $41,456 dend</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AYQ\">Third Computation Retro Divi- 19,572 dend</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A8W\">21,884 debit</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ax5\">Balance due Liberty $44,988 debit</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Aqg\">Fourth Retrospective Adjustment</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A5_e\">Made in 1991</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AJ4\">Loss\u2014$93,100</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A8G\">Audited (Maximum) Premium $137,657</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AeQ\">Previous Dividend $ 19,572</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Arm\">Dividend Offset $ 19,572</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AmM\">(This presentation omits the $10.00 dividend item not subject to retro)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ass\">Fifth and Final Retrospective Adjustment</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AZx\">Made in 1992</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AEQ\">Loss\u2014$98,100</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AJj\">Audited (Maximum) Premium $137,657</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AAg\">Dividend Credit 0</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b497-23\">Thus, by the fourth retrospective adjustment, the losses charged to the Policy had caused the premium to reach its maximum, and Liberty charged back against Lewis the remaining balance of the highest amount of dividend that had been credited to Lewis\u2019s account.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-24\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b497-25\">Liberty sued Lewis in a single count complaint for the balance due on the running account covering all lines. Lewis filed a boilerplate answer containing thirteen numbered defenses, none of which averred any facts and one of which was a general denial under Maryland Rule 2\u2014328(d). Another of the defenses simply named thirteen of the twenty-one affirmative defenses that are listed in Rule 2-32S(g). Among these <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>was \u201cFraud.\u201d The answer did not mention negligent misrepresentation.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-4\">Lewis subsequently filed a counterclaim.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The counterclaim alleged breach of contract by Liberty and claimed damages of $94,080, the amount credited to Lewis resulting from the first retrospective adjustment of premium and of dividend.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b498-5\">Liberty answered the counterclaim and filed a motion for summary judgment. In its answer to Liberty\u2019s motion Lewis stated that \u201cit is not necessary that [Lewis] show that false representations were intentionally made.\u201d In addition Lewis\u2019s answer to the motion stated that Liberty engaged in fraud or \u201cat least that Liberty [] made a false representation of material fact.\u201d The circuit court denied Liberty\u2019s motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-6\">The case was tried to a jury. Lewis\u2019s defense was that the statements made by Liberty\u2019s representative to Ms. Fink constituted a fraudulent or negligent misrepresentation which induced it to accept the Policy. Lewis focused on the difference in the treatment of dividends in readjustments under the contract in effect for the year ending June 30,1986, and under the Policy, and maintained that the representation was that \u201cdividends\u201d paid on the first readjustment under the Policy could not be readjusted for later losses. Lewis submitted that the misrepresentation had two effects. First, used defensively, the misrepresentation effected a rescission of the Policy so that Liberty\u2019s claim for $63,725:70 failed.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Second, under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>Lewis\u2019s theory the rescission, in turn, gave rise to an implied in fact contract that was based on the representations by the Liberty representative and that was identical, at least as to dividends, with the policy in effect for the period ending June 30, 1986. Its damages on the counterclaim, Lewis argued, were the difference between the $94,080 in \u201cdividends\u201d which had been charged back by Liberty against Lewis and the $63,725 of the charge back that had been utilized by Lewis to offset the claim asserted in Liberty\u2019s complaint.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b499-4\">At the conclusion of all of the evidence Liberty orally moved for judgment in its favor on the counterclaim on grounds that we need not consider here. Liberty supplemented the grounds for its motion at the commencement of the next day\u2019s proceedings when it argued, in effect, that Lewis could not claim misrepresentation because Lewis had a duty to read the Policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-5\">The circuit court denied Liberty\u2019s motion for judgment, and the complaint and counterclaim were submitted to the jury on special interrogatories. The circuit court\u2019s initial instructions did not explain negligent misrepresentation. When the jury sent a note asking for an instruction on that subject the circuit court furnished the jury with a written instruction that modified the pattern jury instruction on the tort of negligent misrepresentation. That instruction includes the element of justifiable reliance.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-6\">Set forth below is the jury\u2019s verdict.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b499-7\">\u201cVERDICT SHEET</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b499-8\">\u201cLIABILITY:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b499-9\">\u201c1.

The circuit court struck the verdict in favor of Liberty and entered judgment for Lewis for $31,909 on the counterclaim.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-18\">Liberty appealed to the Court of Special Appeals which reversed. <em>Liberty Mut. Ins. Co. v. Ben Lewis Plumbing, Heating &amp; Air Conditioning, Inc., </em>121 Md.App. 467, 710 A.2d 338 (1998). The Court of Special Appeals held that the defense based on negligent misrepresentation should not have been entertained because Lewis did not plead it as an affirma<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>tive defense in its answer. <em>Id. </em>at 475-79, 710 A.2d at 342-44. Accordingly, the Court of Special Appeals reversed the circuit court\u2019s striking of the verdict in favor of Liberty for $63,725. The intermediate appellate court also held that Lewis\u2019s counterclaim should not have been submitted to the jury, relying substantively on <em>Twelve Knotts Limited Partnership v. Fireman\u2019s Fund Insurance Co., </em>87 Md.App. 88, 589 A.2d 105 (1991), and factually on the admitted failure of Lewis to read the Policy. 121 Md.App. at 472-74, 710 A.2d at 341-42. Although the parol evidence rule had not been raised by Liberty by way of objection to Ms. Fink\u2019s evidence, or by way of an assigned ground for a motion for judgment, and had not been argued by Liberty in support of reversing the circuit court\u2019s judgment on appeal, the Court of Special Appeals observed that the circuit court \u201cshould not have allowed Lewis to proceed on its counterclaim\u201d under the parol evidence rule. <em>Id. </em>at 475, 710 A.2d at 342.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b501-4\">Lewis petitioned for certiorari and Liberty cross-petitioned, raising alternative grounds in support of the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals. Lewis contends that the intermediate appellate court misinterpreted Maryland Rule 2-323 and that it erred in holding that Lewis could not recover on its counterclaim because its representatives had not read the Policy. From among the questions raised in Liberty\u2019s cross-petition we are obliged to consider only those that are essentially the converse of the questions presented by Lewis.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b501-6\">In holding that Lewis could not assert negligent misrepresentation as a defense because it had not been affirmatively pleaded, the Court of Special Appeals erred. Sections (a), (d), and (g) of Rule 2-323 come to play in the analysis. In relevant part they read:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b502-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>\u201c(a) <em>Content. </em>A claim for relief is brought to issue by filing an answer.

Under the second paragraph of section (g), the defense \u201cmay\u201d be pled separately. Nevertheless, the Court of Special Appeals found the requirement for affirmatively pleading negligent misrepresentation in section (a) of the rule, requiring \u201c[ejvery defense\u201d to be asserted in an answer, reinforced by the policy that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>pleadings give fair notice. <em>Liberty Mutual, </em>121 Md.App. at 475-79, 710 A.2d at 341-44. The Court of Special Appeals in effect ruled that the defense had been irrevocably waived.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b503-4\">The plain language of section (g) evidences the intent that the class of affirmative defenses that are to be set forth separately in an answer not be open ended. That intent is further evidenced by the Minutes of the Rules Committee meeting of September 14, 1979. After considering each affirmative defense set forth in then Maryland Rule 342, the Committee turned its attention to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 8(c) and addressed each item enumerated therein. The twentieth item was \u201c[a]ny other matter constituting an avoidance or affirmative defense.\u201d Minutes of Sept. 14, 1979 at 16. The Minutes then record the following decision:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b503-5\">\u201cSeveral Committee members objected to a \u2018catch-all\u2019 phrase being listed as a requirement. The consensus was that only those items included on the list are required to be specially pleaded. A motion to delete subsection (20) carried.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b503-6\">The Rules Committee next considered that portion of the then draft of proposed Maryland Rule 2-323 that is today the second paragraph of section (g). The background of the discussion was that the rules then in effect provided for a special plea on equitable grounds. 1 Md. Rules of Procedure, Rule 342 d.l. (1983).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> At the Rules Committee meeting</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Afv\">\u201cMr. [now Judge] Niemeyer suggested deletion of \u2018or any relief on equitable grounds,\u2019 in the first sentence.

Mr. Bowie suggested the rewording, \u2018on legal or equitable grounds.\u2019 A motion to substitute the language carried.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b504-4\">Minutes of Sept. 14, 1979, at 17.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-5\"><em>Whaley v. Maryland State Bank, </em>58 Md.App. 671, 473 A.2d 1351 (1984), the case on which Lewis principally relies for the recognition of negligent misrepresentation as a defense, held that the defense was to be raised by a plea on equitable grounds. <em>Id. </em>at 681, 473 A.2d at 1356. <em>See also Creamer v. Helferstay, </em>294 Md. 107, 116, 448 A.2d 332, 336 (1982). In <em>Whaley </em>the defense had not been specially pleaded, and it was held to have been waived. <em>Whaley, </em>58 Md.App. at 682, 473 A.2d at 1357. Today, Rule 2-323 governs the instant matter, and it is clear from the proceedings of the Rules Committee that the former special plea on equitable grounds is now embraced within the second paragraph of section (g) under which a separate statement of the defense is permissive and not mandatory.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-6\">Section (a) of Rule 2-323, on which the Court of Special Appeals relied, does emit a contradictory signal. This tension has been noted by commentators. P.V. Niemeyer &amp; L.M. Shuett, <em>Maryland Rules Commentary </em>197 (2d ed.1992) concludes that \u201c[gjood pleading mandates that all known defenses be stated, even though [Rule 2-323(g) ] specifies that only the listed defenses must be raised.\u201d J.A. Lynch &amp; R.W. Bourne, <em>Modem Maryland Civil Practice </em>\u00a7 6.7(c)(4), at 414 (1993) observes that a construction of Rule 2-323(g) that leaves a defendant free not to plead affirmative defenses that are not mandated by the rule \u201cwould foster unfair surprises of a plaintiff as to affirmative defenses not listed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b504-7\">We need not fully resolve the interrelationship of \u00a7\u00a7 (a) and (g) of Rule 2-323 in this case. This case is an action for breach of contract and the claim for relief is for money only. We are dealing with one of the specified causes governed by \u00a7 (d) of the rule. Section (d) retains the general issue plea of common law pleading. Section (d) is a more specific provision then \u00a7 (a). In the causes specified in \u00a7 (d) in which a general <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>denial is filed, it is not necessary for the pleader to assert \u201c[e]very defense of law or fact\u201d in the answer, except for those specifically enumerated in \u00a7 (g). Inasmuch as Lewis pled a general denial, Lewis did not waive its defense of negligent misrepresentation by not pleading it specially.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-4\"><em>Gilbert v. Washington Suburban Sanitary Comm\u2019n, </em>304 Md. 658, 500 A.2d 1039 (1985), relied upon by Liberty to support its waiver argument, is not inconsistent with our holding. Gilbert, a temporary employee, sued the Washington Suburban Sanitary Commission (WSSC) where Gilbert had been assigned by a temporary help agency. The claim was for damages for personal injuries sustained on the job,.and WSSC moved to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction over the subject matter on the theory that workers\u2019 compensation was the exclusive remedy. We pointed out that the circuit court had jurisdiction so that the motion to dismiss had been improperly granted. We further commented that the question of compensation exclusivity \u201cshould have been raised as an affirmative defense,\u201d referring in a footnote to the second paragraph of Rule 2-323(g) which permits additional affirmative defenses. <em>Id, </em>at 61, 500 A.2d at 1041. The passage relied upon by Liberty is a critique of WSSC\u2019s pleading and not a holding that the exclusivity defense was waived. Indeed, we remanded the matter to the trial court for further proceedings to determine whether or not Gilbert was an employee of WSSC and thus, whether the defense applied.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-5\">\n<em>TV</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b505-6\">Despite our conclusion in Part III, <em>supra, </em>we affirm the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals because the circuit court erred in failing to grant Liberty\u2019s motion for judgment at the conclusion of the case on the ground, shorthandedly expressed by Liberty, that Lewis had a duty to read the Policy. Liberty relies on <em>Twelve Knotts Limited Partnership v. Fireman\u2019s Fund Insurance Co., </em>87 Md.App. 88, 589 A.2d 105 (1991). There the plaintiff owned numerous investment properties. It circulated a request for proposals for all of its fire, general liability, automobile, and workers\u2019 compen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>sation insurance with premiums to be paid annually, or in lesser installments without finance charge. The owner also asked that the premiums be quoted on a three-year basis. The defendant submitted a propos\u00e1l which included a guarantee that the first year\u2019s premium would remain constant over the second and third years.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The owner accepted the proposal and paid the first year\u2019s premium. At the end of the first year the defendant greatly increased the premium, and the owner-insured sued, unsuccessfully.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-4\">In the policy as issued a section of the general conditions, captioned \u201cPremium,\u201d stated in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b506-5\">\u201c Tf this policy is issued for a period of three years <em>and premium is not paid in advance, </em>the premiums due for each annual period of this policy shall be computed in accordance with the Companies [sic] rules, rates, rating plans, premiums and minimum premium in effect (a) on the inception date of each annual period for annualized policies, or (b) on the inception date of the policy for non-annualized policies.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b506-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 95, 589 A2d at 109. (Emphasis added by the <em>Twelve Knotts </em>court). The insured claimed, <em>inter alia, </em>breach of the contract to procure insurance carrying a guaranteed premium.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-7\">On the owner\u2019s appeal from a judgment entered on motion at the conclusion of the plaintiffs case, the Court of Special Appeals recognized that the policy\u2019s terms did not conform to the proposal accepted by the owner, but the court further said that \u201cthe non-conformance was apparent from the policy, and, had [the insured] read the policy conditions, [the insured] would have been immediately aware of the non-conformance.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 103, 589 A.2d at 113.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-8\">The court further quoted what appeared to it to be the general rule as stated in 12 J.A. Appleman, <em>Insurance Law and Practice </em>\u00a7 7155, at 533-34 (1981), reading as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b507-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>\u201c \u00a3[W]hen the insured accepts a policy, he accepts all of its stipulations, provided they are legal and not contrary to public policy. Where changes from the application appear in the delivered contract, under a more stringent doctrine the insured has a duty to examine it promptly and notify the company immediately of his refusal to accept it. If such policy is accepted or is retained an unreasonable length of time, the insured is presumed to have ratified any changes therein and to have agreed to all its terms.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b507-4\"><em>Twelve Knotts, </em>87 Md.App. at 104, 589 A.2d at 113.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-5\">Adopting the above-quoted rule, the Court of Special Appeals held that the insured\u2019s contract action failed. The court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b507-6\">\u201cAppellant is a sophisticated business entity having had previous experience purchasing insurance. The offending policy provision is clear and unambiguous. [The insured partners and their executive director] had an opportunity when the policy was delivered to discover the provision and, if they chose, reject the policy on the ground of non-conformance. Unfortunately, they neglected to do so. By receiving the policy and remaining silent until the end of the policy year, appellant is deemed to have accepted the policy with the non-conforming provision in it.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b507-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 104-05, 589 A.2d at 113-14.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-8\">We need not express here agreement or disagreement with the result in <em>Twelve Knotts </em>because the case now before us is a stronger case for application of the rule applied in <em>Twelve Knotts. </em>The misrepresentation on which Lewis relies is the statement by the Liberty representative to Ms. Fink, made at the time of the proposal, that the \u201ccoverage\u201d proposed to be issued for the year beginning July 1, 1986, would be the same as that under the policies then in effect. But that is not all that occurred. Wfiien Liberty later transmitted the issued policies Liberty also sent, separate from the binder of policies, the one-page confirmation letter that set forth the dividend redetermination endorsement that was part of the Policy. The terms of that confirmation letter (and of the endorsement) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>are clear and unambiguous. Further, Liberty requested that Ms. Fink sign the confirmation letter next to the words \u201cAccepted by,\u201d and she in fact signed it and sent it to Liberty.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-4\">By obtaining Lewis\u2019s written acceptance of the dividend endorsement Liberty was complying with the notice requirements that were recognized in <em>Government Employees Insurance Co. v. Ropka, 74 </em>Md.App. 249, 536 A.2d 1214 (1988). There the court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b508-5\">\u201cMost jurisdictions impose an affirmative duty on the insurer to make the insured aware of changes inserted into a renewal policy; absent notice of the change, the insured is entitle to coverage as the policy originally stated.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b508-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 267, 536 A.2d at 1223. The court cited numerous authorities including <em>Bauman v. Royal Indemnity Co., </em>36 N.J. 12, 25, 174 A.2d 585, 591-92 (1961), where the New Jersey Supreme Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b508-7\">\u201c \u2018[Wjhere ... the insurance company simply sends a renewal policy for the new period of coverage, the insured, in all likelihood, will not read it over again and may not fairly be expected to do so. Absent notification that there have been changes in the restrictions, conditions or limitations of the policy, the insured is justly entitled to assume that they remain the same and that his coverage has not in anywise been lessened.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b508-8\"><em>Ropka, 74 </em>Md.App. at 268, 536 A.2d at 1223.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-9\"><em>J.A.M. Associates v. Western World Insurance Co., </em>95 Md.App. 695, 622 A.2d 818 (1993), involved a change\u2014insertion of a lead paint exclusion\u2014on the renewal of a liability policy insuring property owners. The court affirmed the refusal by the trial court to reform the policy to include coverage for lead paint caused injuries. Based on the information that the insured could have drawn from four factors, none of which was so clear cut as having the insured accept the new provision in writing, the court held that there was sufficient notice of the change. Relevant to the instant matter is the court\u2019s explanation of why notice of the change is required.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b509-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>\u201cTo a large extent, the requirement of notice proceeds from an ambiguity in the word \u2018renewal,\u2019 which the public may, with some good reason, regard as synonymous with \u2018extension\u2019\u2014a continuation of the existing policy for another term. Thus, as a matter of fairness and of assuring mutual assent to what is, in reality, a new contract, the law requires that reasonable notice be given to the insured if the insurer intends to make a significant change in the new policy.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A-b\"><em>Id. </em>at 704, 622 A.2d at 822.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-4\">The statement by Liberty\u2019s representative on which Lewis relies as a misrepresentation leads to the same conclusion that an insured, absent other facts, ordinarily may reasonably draw in a renewal context. But, in the instant matter, the assent of the insured to the change is manifested by Lewis\u2019s signature on the confirmation letter. Thus the ordinary conclusion is negated in this case. In terms of the defense of negligent misrepresentation, there was legally insufficient evidence of a reliance on the asserted misrepresentation that was justifiable.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-5\">Absent a triable issue of justifiable reliance the issue of negligent misrepresentation should not have been submitted to the jury. Accordingly, under Lewis\u2019s theory of the case, no implied contract came into being and judgment on the counterclaim should have been entered on motion in favor of Liberty. Although Liberty\u2019s motion for judgment did not expressly include judgment in its favor on its claim (negligent misrepresentation having been the only defense) the jury found in favor of Liberty on the complaint so that any procedural deficiency is moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-6\">JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS AFFIRMED. COSTS TO BE PAID BY THE PETITIONERS, BEN LEWIS PLUMBING, HEATING &amp; AIR CONDITIONING, INC.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b492-6\">. L.R. Russ &amp; T.F. Segalla, <em>Couch on Insurance </em>\u00a7 69:15, at 69-37 through 69-39 (3d ed.1997), describes retrospective rating in part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b492-7\">\"The contract of insurance may provide for the premium to be set retroactively, based upon the insured\u2019s actual loss experience, or total payroll during a set period of time. This method of premium computation, referred to as \u2018retrospective rating,\u2019 usually requires that the insured deposit an advance premium with the insurer. At the conclusion of the agreed upon period of time, the insurer computes the premium with reference to rate schedules, rules, and its own manuals. If the premium calculated at the end of the designated time period is less than the premium deposit, the insured will be due a refund....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b492-8\">\u201cThe most common use of retrospective rating is in fields where neither the insurer nor the insured has any realistic basis for assessing risks at the beginning of the policy period. These fields include business liability and workers\u2019 compensation, where the nature of the insured entity\u2019s activities and the exact compensation of its work force are subject to rather wide variation.... In such circumstances, the insurer usually inserts a provision calling for an \u2018audit\u2019 or \u2018inspection\u2019 during or after the policy period, and applies standard rates to the risk that was actually undertaken.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b492-9\">(Footnotes omitted).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b498-7\">.

Throughout the proceedings, and at all levels, Lewis includes the $53,657 credit on the first computation of retrospective premium as part of the \"dividend.\" Lewis, however, has not argued that the dividend plan for the period ending June 30, 1986, should be interpreted to include a promise not to readjust premium in addition to dividends.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b498-9\">. Lewis\u2019s assumption is that its loss due to the misrepresentation is $94,080 of \"dividends,\u201d thus exceeding the $63,725.70 claimed by Liberty.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b499-13\">.
