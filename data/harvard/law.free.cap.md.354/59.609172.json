Banks worked at Carroll County General Hospital as a medical-surgical house physician. As house physician, Dr. Banks was expected to work twelve hour shifts and was responsible for admitting patients into the hospital, caring for patients, and assisting in the operating room and emergency department. The house physician program was new to the hospital and was thus underutilized by the medical staff, resulting in considerable \u201cdown time\u201d for the house physician. Because of the underutilization, Dr. Banks often agreed to work twenty-four and thirty-six hour shifts, frequently working as many as thirty shifts per month. When on duty, Dr. Banks was not free to leave the hospital and was expected to be available at all times. Nevertheless, when Dr. Banks was on duty but not utilized by the medical staff, he was free to sleep, eat, watch television, use the telephone, read, or visit with other employees in the hospital.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-7\">The evidence at the administrative hearing in this case disclosed the following. During the time Dr. Banks was employed by Carroll County General Hospital, he engaged in a pattern of sexually harassing female employees while he was on duty. A unit secretary at the hospital, witness # 1, stated that Dr. Banks on several occasions came to her work station and repeatedly touched her, rubbed her shoulders, back and neck, put his hands through her hair, and pinched her behind. She further stated that Dr. Banks \u201crepeatedly made rude and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>unnecessary comments, most often regarding sex.\u201d She testified that on one occasion, Dr. Banks approached her from behind and put his hands around her waist and squeezed her stomach. Witness # 1 was offended by Dr. Banks\u2019s unwelcome advances and told him to leave her alone. She indicated that Dr. Banks\u2019s \u201cconduct often occurred in areas where patients, visitors, and other staff could observe the embarrassing advances.\u201d Witness # 1 reported the offensive conduct to her supervisor and also filed a written report describing the conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-5\">Witness #2, a unit secretary in the hospital\u2019s emergency department, also reported sexual harassment by Dr. Banks. She stated that on one occasion shortly after she began her employment at the hospital, Dr. Banks was waiting behind her to stamp some documents on the addressograph machine for a patient he was admitting. While he was waiting, Dr. Banks hit witness #2 \u201cvery hard on the backside, causing her to jump in surprise.\u201d Witness #2 testified that on another occasion, an employee had accidentally knocked over a cup of coffee, spilling coffee on witness #2 and on her shoes. At that time Dr. Banks asked witness # 2 to retrieve a patient chart for him. Witness #2 told Dr. Banks that she would retrieve the chart just as soon as she was able to clean the coffee off of herself. Dr. Banks responded, \u201c[w]hy don\u2019t you let me lick it off.\u201d Witness # 2 told Dr. Banks that he was \u201cdisgusting\u201d and that he should leave her alone. On a third occasion, Dr. Banks came to witness # 2\u2019s desk and asked her when she would go out with him, to which witness #2 responded \u201cnever.\u201d An emergency department nurse observed and commented upon this last incident. Witness # 2 subsequently filed a complaint with the hospital administration concerning Dr. Banks\u2019s unwelcome behavior.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-6\">Witness #3, an emergency department registrar at the hospital, testified that Dr. Banks asked her to go out with him for drinks. Witness # 3 declined, stating that she was only nineteen years old and that she had a steady boyfriend. On another occasion, witness # 3 was walking out of the ladies room into the hallway outside the emergency department <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>when Dr. Banks \u201cpinned\u201d her up against the wall with his arms and knee. She stated that they were so close that their stomachs were touching. Dr. Banks then asked witness # 3 \u201cis it going to be your place or mine?\u201d To this, witness # 3 replied \u201cneither.\u201d Dr. Banks again asked her \u201cwhen will it be?\u201d She replied \u201cnever.\u201d An orderly who observed the incident pulled Dr. Banks away from witness # 3, allowing her to escape. Witness #3 overheard Dr. Banks say to the orderly, \u201cI guess she is not wet yet.\u201d Witness # 3 prepared a written report of this incident and subsequently filed a legal action against Dr. Banks.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-4\">The director of the emergency department at the hospital counseled Dr. Banks on several occasions regarding complaints about his conduct. In December 1987, the director counseled Dr. Banks concerning a comment Dr. Banks had made to a nurse, to the effect that \u201cI\u2019d like to get you behind closed doors.\u201d In May 1988, Dr. Banks was again counseled for a comment to a female employee, who was wearing red, that wearing red on certain days indicated sexual promiscuity. Finally, in September 1991, Dr. Banks was counseled concerning the incident with witness # 3. The hospital presented Dr. Banks with several options, and he elected to take a leave of absence. The hospital board of directors denied Dr. Banks\u2019s application for privileges as a result of his conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-5\">The Board of Physician Quality Assurance received information that Dr. Banks had been denied privileges at Carroll County General Hospital and subsequently decided to charge Dr. Banks with violating \u00a7 14\u2014404(a)(3) of the Health Occupations Article, which provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b102-6\">\u201c(a) <em>In </em>general.\u2014Subject to the hearing provisions of \u00a7 14-405 of this subtitle, the Board, on the affirmative vote of a majority of its full authorized membership, may reprimand any licensee, place any licensee on probation, or suspend or revoke a license if the licensee:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b102-7\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b102-8\">(3) Is guilty of immoral or unprofessional conduct in the practice of medicine.... \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b103-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>The Board issued charges and a summons to Dr. Banks to appear at a hearing before an administrative law judge (ALJ).</p>\n<p id=\"b103-4\">In a motion to dismiss the charges, Dr. Banks contended that the Board lacked jurisdiction and authority to take action in this case because Dr. Banks\u2019s conduct was not in the practice of medicine as is required by \u00a7 14\u2014404(a)(3); rather, according to Dr. Banks, it did not even bear \u201cthe slightest relationship to [Dr. Banks\u2019s] performance of the practice of medicine, as that term is defined in \u00a7 14-101.\u201d Section 14-101(k) of the Health Occupations Article defines the \u201cpractice of medicine\u201d as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b103-5\">\u201c(1) ... to engage, with or without compensation, in medical:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b103-6\">(i) Diagnosis;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b103-7\">(ii) Healing;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b103-8\">(iii) Treatment; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b103-9\">(iv) Surgery.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b103-10\">(2) \u201cPractice of medicine\u201d includes doing, undertaking, professing to do, and attempting any of the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b103-11\">(i) Diagnosing, healing, treating, preventing, prescribing for, or removing any physical, mental, or emotional ailment or supposed ailment of an individual.... \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b103-12\">The ALJ reserved ruling on Dr. Banks\u2019s motion until after a hearing on the merits. After conducting the evidentiary hearing, the ALJ issued a proposed order finding the facts as previously outlined and concluding that Dr. Banks violated \u00a7 14-404(a)(3) by committing unprofessional conduct in the practice of medicine, on two different occasions, toward witness # 2. The ALJ further concluded that Dr. Banks\u2019s conduct involving witnesses # 1 and # 3 was not in the practice of medicine. The ALJ held that Dr. Banks\u2019s conduct while waiting to use the addressograph machine to admit a patient and requesting that witness # 2' obtain a patient record were \u201cpart of the undertaking of patient treatment\u201d and were, therefore, within the \u201cactual performance of the practice of medicine.\u201d The ALJ stated that Dr. Banks was not \u201cundertaking the diagnosing, healing or treating of an individual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>during the events described by -witness # 1 or witness # 3.\u201d The ALJ proposed reprimanding Dr. Banks and requiring an evaluation by a psychiatrist to determine if psychiatric treatment was necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-4\">The Board of Physician Quality Assurance adopted the ALJ\u2019s basic findings of fact but determined that all of Dr. Banks\u2019s above-described conduct, including his conduct toward witnesses # 1 and # 3, constituted \u201cimmoral or unprofessional conduct in the practice of medicine.\u201d The Board took the position that Dr. Banks\u2019s conduct occurred within the \u201cpractice of medicine\u201d because his \u201cpresence in the hospital and \u2018on-call\u2019 status clearly involved more than merely a \u2018general or associative\u2019 relationship with his practice as a physician.\u201d Furthermore, the Board reasoned that a \u201chospital environment must at all times be conducive to the practice of medicine\u201d because at \u201cany time, an unforseen patient care emergency may require intensive team effort necessarily involving both physicians and hospital staff.\u201d It determined that Dr. Banks\u2019s conduct \u201crisks a breakdown of the cooperation [among] the medical team which is so necessary to patient treatment in a hospital setting.\u201d The Board held that, because Dr. Banks\u2019s \u201cconduct affected and soured the hospital working environment, there was a direct impact on patient care, thus implicating the actual practice of medicine.\u201d The Board ordered that Dr. Banks be reprimanded and placed on probation subject to terms and conditions, including evaluation by a psychiatrist to determine if he should undergo psychotherapy.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-5\">Dr. Banks filed in the Circuit Court for Carroll County an action for judicial review of the Board\u2019s decision. The circuit court affirmed the Board\u2019s decision, reasoning that \u201cthe legislature did not intend to limit the application of Section 14-404(a)(3) to cases in which a physician is dealing with a patient directly, or face-to-face.\u201d The court agreed with the Board that all of Dr. Banks\u2019s immoral or unprofessional conduct towards the three witnesses was in the practice of medicine because it occurred while he was \u201con his shift at the hospital,\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>\u201cin uniform\u201d (wearing scrubs), and present in the hospital \u201cfor the sole purpose of practicing medicine.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b105-4\">Dr. Banks appealed to the Court of Special Appeals which affirmed in part and reversed in part. <em>Banks v. Board of Physician Quality Assurance, </em>116 Md.App. 249, 695 A.2d 1260 (1997). The intermediate appellate court held that, in order to discipline a physician under \u00a7 14-404(a)(3), the immoral or unprofessional conduct must occur \u201cduring the diagnosis, care, or treatment of patients.\u201d 116 Md.App. at 262, 695 A.2d at 1267. Using this definition of the \u201cpractice of medicine,\u201d the Court of Special Appeals affirmed the circuit court\u2019s decision with respect to witness #2. The court reasoned that Dr. Banks\u2019s conduct was within the practice of medicine because using the addressograph machine and requesting a patient record were both \u201cnecessary procedure[s] and ... part of the treatment of a patient.\u201d 116 Md.App. at 263, 695 A.2d at 1268. The Court of Special Appeals disagreed with the circuit court and the Board with respect to witnesses # 1 and # 3 because Dr. Banks was not \u201cdiagnosing, caring for, or treating patients while he was sexually harassing witnesses one or three.\u201d 116 Md.App. at 263, 695 A.2d at 1267.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-5\">Both sides filed petitions for a writ of certiorari, and this Court granted both petitions. <em>Board of Physicians v. Banks, </em>347 Md. 683, 702 A.2d 291 (1997). Although worded differently, both petitions presented essentially the same issue, namely whether Dr. Banks\u2019s conduct, as previously described, constituted immoral or unprofessional conduct in the practice of medicine within the meaning of \u00a7 14-404(a)(3) of the Health Occupations Article.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-7\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-8\">A court\u2019s role in reviewing an administrative agency adjudicatory decision is narrow, <em>United Parcel v. People\u2019s Counsel, </em>336 Md. 569, 576, 650 A.2d 226, 230 (1994); it \u201cis limited to determining if there is substantial evidence in the record as a whole to support the agency\u2019s findings and conclu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>sions, and to determine if the administrative decision is-premised upon an erroneous conclusion,of law.\u201d <em>United Parcel, </em>336 Md. at 577, 650 A.2d at 230. <em>See also </em>Code (1984, 1995 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7 10-222(h) of the State Government Article; <em>District Council v. Brandywine, </em>350 Md. 339, 349, 711 A.2d 1346, 1350-1351 (1998); <em>Catonsville Nursing v. Loveman, </em>349 Md. 560, 568-569, 709 A.2d 749, 753 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b106-4\">In applying the substantial evidence test, a reviewing court decides \u201c \u2018 \u201cwhether a reasoning mind reasonably could have reached the factual conclusion the agency reached.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>Bulluck v. Pelham Wood Apts., </em>283 Md. 505, 512, 390 A.2d 1119, 1123 (1978). See <em>Anderson v. Dep\u2019t of Public Safety, </em>330 Md. 187, 213, 623 A.2d 198, 210 (1993). A reviewing court should defer to the agency\u2019s fact-finding and drawing of inferences if they are supported by the record. <em>CBS v. Comptroller, </em>319 Md. 687, 698, 575 A.2d 324, 329 (1990). A reviewing court \u201c \u2018must review the agency\u2019s decision in the light most favorable to it; ... the- agency\u2019s decision is prima facie correct and presumed valid, and ... it is the agency\u2019s province to resolve conflicting evidence\u2019 and to draw inferences from that evidence.\u201d <em>CBS v. Comptroller, supra, </em>319 Md. at 698, 575 A.2d at 329, quoting <em>Ramsay, Scarlett &amp; Co. v. Comptroller, </em>302 Md. 825, 834-835, 490 A.2d 1296, 1301 (1985). <em>See Catonsville Nursing v. Loveman, supra, </em>349 Md. at 569, 709 A.2d at 753 (final agency decisions \u201care <em>prima facie </em>correct and carry -with them the presumption of validity\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b106-5\">Despite some unfortunate language that has crept into a few of our opinions,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> a \u201ccourt\u2019s task on review is <em>not </em>to \u2018 \u201c \u2018substitute its judgment for the expertise of those persons who constitute the administrative agency,\u2019 \u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>United Parcel v.

Pelham Wood Apts., supra, </em>283 Md. at 513, 390 A.2d at 1124. Even with regard to some legal issues, a degree of deference should often be accorded the position of the administrative agency. Thus, an administrative agency\u2019s interpretation and application of the statute which the agency administers should ordinarily be given considerable weight by reviewing courts. <em>Lussier v. Md. Racing Commission, </em>343 Md. 681, 696-697, 684 A.2d 804, 811-812 (1996), and cases there cited; <em>McCullough v. Wittner, </em>314 Md. 602, 612, 552 A.2d 881, 886 (1989) (\u201cThe interpretation of a statute by those officials charged with administering the statute is ... entitled to weight\u201d).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Furthermore, the expertise of the agency in its own field should be respected. <em>Fogle v. H &amp; G Restaurant, </em>337 Md. 441, 455, 654 A.2d 449, 456 (1995); <em>Christ v. Department of Natural Resources, </em>335 Md. 427, 445, 644 A.2d 34, 42 (1994) (legislative delegations of authority to administrative agencies will often include the authority to make \u201csignificant discretionary policy determinations\u201d); <em>Bd. of Ed. For Dorchester Co. v. Hubbard, </em>305 Md. 774, 792, 506 A.2d 625, 634 (1986) (\u201capplication of the State Board of Education\u2019s expertise would clearly be desirable before a court attempts to resolve the\u201d legal issues).</p>\n<p id=\"b107-5\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-6\">At the outset, we point out that there was clearly substantial evidence supporting the ALJ\u2019s findings of basic facts which were adopted by the Board. The testimony and written statements by witnesses 1, 2, and 3 directly supported the administrative findings of fact. Moreover, the ALJ and the Board were certainly justified in characterizing Dr. Banks\u2019s conduct as \u201cimmoral or unprofessional conduct.\u201d The only real disputed issue in these judicial review proceedings has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>been whether Dr. Banks\u2019s conduct occurred \u201cin the practice of medicine.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b108-4\">In light of the principles outlined in Part II A above, we believe that the Board\u2019s conclusion, that Dr. Banks\u2019s conduct with regard to witnesses 1, 2 and 3, occurred \u201cin the practice of medicine,\u201d was reasonable. The circuit court correctly affirmed the Board\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-5\">In 1888, the Maryland Legislature adopted an \u201coriginal Act creating a system for the regulation of the practice of medicine and surgery in Maryland.\u201d <em>Aitchison v. State, </em>204 Md. 538, 544, 105 A.2d 495, 498, <em>cert. denied </em>348 U.S. 880, 75 S.Ct. 116, 99 L.Ed. 692 (1954). Section 7 of this Act authorized denial or revocation of a physician\u2019s certificate upon proof of \u201cunprofessional or dishonorable conduct.\u201d Ch. 429 of the Acts of 1888. It was not until 1968 that Maryland law required that the immoral or unprofessional conduct of the physician occur <em>in the practice </em>of medicine. Ch. 469 of the Acts of 1968.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Section 14-404(a)(3) of the Health Occupations Article is the most recent version of this statute, requiring that the physician\u2019s conduct be \u201cimmoral or unprofessional conduct in the practice of medicine.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b108-6\">On one previous occasion this Court examined what is embraced by the phrase \u201cin the practice of medicine.\u201d In <em>McDonnell v. Comm\u2019n on Medical Discipline, </em>301 Md. 426, 429-430, 483 A.2d 76, 77-78 (1984), we considered the question of whether a physician\u2019s attempt to intimidate adverse expert witnesses scheduled to testify against him in a medical malpractice case was \u201c[i]mmoral conduct of a physician in his practice as a physician\u201d in violation of \u00a7 14-404(a)(3)\u2019s statutory predecessor, Code (1957, 1980 RepLVol.), Article 43, \u00a7 130(h)(8). We held that, although Dr. McDonnell\u2019s conduct was \u201cimproper and not to be condoned,\u201d it was \u201cnot censurable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>under \u00a7 [14-404(a)(3) ].\u201d <em>McDonnell, </em>301 Md. at 434, 483 A.2d at 80. The Court agreed that Dr. McDonnell\u2019s act was \u201crelated to his professional practice\u201d but was insufficient to bring his conduct within the statute\u2019s requirement that the conduct occur in his \u201cpractice as a physician.\u201d 301 Md. at 437, 483 A.2d at 81. We held that immoral conduct merely committed during the term of licensure or having only a \u201cgeneral or associative relationship to the physician in his capacity as a member of the medical profession\u201d is not within the language of the statute. 301 Md. at 436, 483 A.2d at 81. Rather, the \u201capplication of [\u00a7 14-404(a)(3) ] is directly tied to the physician\u2019s conduct in the actual performance of the practice of medicine, <em>ie., </em>in the diagnosis, care, or treatment of patients.\u201d 301 Md. at 437, 483 A.2d at 81.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-4\">In the present case, the Board rejected Dr. Banks\u2019s argument that our <em>McDonnell </em>holding precluded Board action. The Board distinguished <em>McDonnell, </em>concluding that the \u201cconnection between [Dr. McDonnell\u2019s] conduct in the judicial arena and the practice of medicine is tenuous.\u201d The Board held that Dr. Banks\u2019s conduct was \u201cclosely associated with [his] practice as a physician\u201d because of his \u201cpresence in the hospital and \u2018on-call\u2019 status.\u201d It reasoned that Dr. Banks\u2019s conduct had more than a \u201cgeneral or associative\u201d relationship to the practice of medicine because it \u201caffected and soured the hospital working environment,\u201d thereby having a \u201cdirect impact on patient care\u201d and falling within the scope of \u00a7 14-404(a)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b109-5\">Dr. Banks argues that none of his conduct is within the practice of medicine because, when it occurred, he was not diagnosing, treating or evaluating patients. He points out that when he committed these acts of sexual harassment, he was merely \u201cchatting or socializing with co-workers.\u201d (Banks\u2019s brief at 11). In addition, Dr. Banks relies on the fact that these co-workers were not nurses, doctors, physician\u2019s assistants, or medical technicians, and, therefore were \u201cnot trained in the practice of medicine or nursing and [do] not participate directly in the care, treatment or diagnosis of patients.\u201d <em>(Id, </em>at 9.) Dr. Banks specifically disputes the Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>of Special Appeals\u2019 conclusion that he was practicing medicine during the incidents concerning witness # 2. He asserts that stamping a chart on the addressograph machine and requesting a chart from medical records are merely clerical functions which are not within the definition of diagnosing, caring for, or treating patients. Otherwise, he argues, when clerical personnel such as witness # 2 perform clerical tasks, they engage in the practice of medicine without a license. Dr. Banks states that when the addressograph incident occurred, he had not yet seen or diagnosed a patient. Similarly, he argues that when he requested that witness # 2 retrieve a chart for him, he merely wanted the chart in order to \u201csign off\u2019 on it, which is typically done when a patient has already been discharged.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-4\">We agree with the Board that this case is distinguishable from <em>McDonnell. </em>In <em>McDonnell, </em>the physician\u2019s conduct occurred during judicial proceedings against him based upon conduct constituting malpractice. His conduct did not occur in the workplace where he was present for the purpose of practicing medicine. Dr. McDonnell\u2019s conduct had only a \u201cgeneral or associative relationship\u201d to his \u201ccapacity as a member of the medical profession\u201d rather than being \u201cdirectly tied to [his] conduct in the actual performance of the practice of medicine, i.e., in the diagnosis, care, or treatment of patients.\u201d <em>McDonnell, </em>301 Md. at 436-437, 483 A.2d at 81.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-5\">The Board could reasonably hold that Dr. Banks\u2019s conduct of sexually harassing hospital employees was within the practice of medicine because he was on duty and in the working areas of the hospital. When on duty, Dr. Banks was responsible for admitting patients, caring for patients, and assisting in the operating room and emergency department. He was not free to leave, and he was expected to be available at all times. When Dr. Banks was on duty he was there for the purpose of practicing medicine; <em>ie., </em>for the \u201cdiagnosis, care, or treatment of patients.\u201d <em>McDonnell, </em>301 Md. at 437, 483 A.2d at 81. Dr. Banks sexually harassed his co-workers who were present in the working areas of the hospital in connection with the practice of medicine. This conduct has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>more than merely a \u201cgeneral or associative relationship\u201d to Dr. Banks\u2019s capacity as a member of the medical profession. The connection to the practice of medicine was sufficient for the Board to conclude that it is \u201cin the actual performance of the practice of medicine.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b111-4\">The Court of Special Appeals\u2019 interpretation and application of the statute creates a distinction without a difference. Under that court\u2019s analysis, Dr. Banks could not be sanctioned for his unwanted advances towards and touching of witness # 1 while she was at her work .station but he could be disciplined for this conduct if he had asked witness # 1 to retrieve a chart for him or to prepare a patient\u2019s file. Similarly,, Dr. Banks could not be sanctioned for accosting witness # 3 in the hallway unless witness # 3 was engaged in conduct such as retrieving a patient\u2019s chart or on her way to use the addressograph machine.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-7\">Dr. Banks urges that the practice of medicine be interpreted even more narrowly. He suggests that a physician may only be sanctioned under \u00a7 14-404(a)(3) if he or she is in the immediate process of diagnosing, evaluating, examining or treating a patient and engaged in a non-clerical task. This approach would lead to illogical results. For example, Dr. Banks concedes that a physician could be disciplined for exposing himself while examining an x-ray to determine whether a patient broke a bone because this is actual diagnosis and thus falls within the practice of medicine. (Banks\u2019s reply brief at 15-16). On the other hand, if the physician were to expose himself to a nurse in the hallway immediately before or after examining the x-ray, this would not be in the practice of medicine, and hence not within the purview of \u00a7 14-404(a)(3). This approach so narrowly construes \u00a7 14-404(a)(3) that it would lead to unreasonable results and render the statute inadequate to deal with many situations which may arise.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-8\">Other jurisdictions have rejected such a limited interpretation of statutes similar to \u00a7 14-404(a)(3) and have held that a medical professional\u2019s conduct in sexually harassing co-work<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>ers and employees is within the practice of medicine. The Hawaii Supreme Court upheld a physician\u2019s suspension from the practice of medicine when he committed acts of sexual misconduct against his medical assistant in connection with her performance of clerical tasks. <em>Loui v. Board of Medical Examiners, </em>78 Hawai'i 21, 889 P.2d 705 (1995). The <em>Loui </em>court reasoned that this conduct was sufficient to satisfy the statutory requirement that the physician\u2019s conduct be \u201c \u2018substantially related to the qualifications, functions, or duties of a physician.\u2019 \u201d <em>Loui, </em>78 Hawai'i at 80-31, 889 P.2d at 714-715. In <em>Flickinger v. Com., Dept. of State, </em>75 Pa.Cmwlth. 84, 86-89, 461 A.2d 336, 337-338 (1983), the Pennsylvania court upheld the revocation of a chiropractor\u2019s license when he committed \u201cgross ... misconduct in carrying on of such profession\u201d by sexually harassing his co-workers and employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-4\">The primary factors that distinguish this case from <em>McDonnell </em>were that Dr. Banks was on duty at the hospital, and was present in the working areas of the hospital. In other cases considering whether a physician\u2019s conduct was within the statutory requirement of \u201cin the practice of medicine,\u201d a critical factor has been whether the conduct occurred while the physician was performing a task integral to his or her medical practice. Courts have not applied an extremely technical and narrow definition of the practice of medicine. For example, physicians have been disciplined for misconduct in the practice of medicine while performing clerical tasks such as billing third party payors. <em>See Wassermann v. Board of Regents of University, </em>11 N.Y.2d 173, 177-179, 182 N.E.2d 264, 265-266, 227 N.Y.S.2d 649, 650-652, <em>cert. denied </em>371 U.S. 861, 83 S.Ct. 116, 9 L.Ed.2d 99 (1962) (physician\u2019s license revoked due to finding of \u201c \u2018fraud or deceit in the practice of medicine\u2019 \u201d when physician submitted false reports and bills to an attorney even though the fraud was not perpetrated directly on the patient); <em>Catena v. Com., State Bd. of Medical Ed., </em>49 Pa.Cmwlth. 542, 543-547, 411 A.2d 869, 870-871 (1980) (physician\u2019s license suspended for fraudulent medicare claims in the \u201cpractice of medicine\u201d). <em>See also Quintana v. Com., State Bd. of Ost. Med. Ex., </em>77 Pa.Cmwlth. 438, 440-442, 466 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>A.2d 250, 252-253 (1983) (physician\u2019s license revoked, <em>inter alia, </em>for \u201cfraudulent representations in the practice of osteopathic medicine and surgery\u201d when he fraudulently prescribed drugs for his personal use even though the action did not \u201caffect the care of patients\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b113-5\">The Board was justified in holding that Dr. Banks\u2019s conduct posed a threat to patients, not only because a \u201chospital environment must at all times be conducive to the practice of medicine,\u201d but also because his conduct was a threat to the teamwork approach of health care which requires participation from a variety of hospital personnel in order to deliver effective patient care. In fact, the evidence shows that Dr. Banks\u2019s conduct affected the working environment so deleteriously that it caused hospital employees to avoid him. For example, witness # 1 testified that she \u201ctried to avoid being around when he [Dr. Banks] was doing his job at the nurses\u2019 station.\u201d On another occasion, when Dr. Banks and witness # 1 were alone in the kitchen, and when Dr. Banks engaged in the innocuous task of closing the kitchen door, witness # 1 became so \u201cfrightened\u201d that she \u201cimmediately left\u201d the room. In the Board\u2019s charges filed against Dr. Banks, it stated that Dr. Banks\u2019s application for privileges was denied, in part, because of the \u201cunwillingness of the nurses [and] victims of his harassment, to allow [him] to return to hospital duties\u201d as well as the \u201creal possibility of a serious moral[e] problem among the hospital\u2019s female employees should [Dr. Banks] be granted privileges.\u201d Obviously Dr. Banks\u2019s misconduct could easily have an adverse effect upon patient care.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-6\">Dr. Banks suggests that sexual harassment of employees is within the jurisdiction of the employer and the Maryland Commission on Human Relations, and therefore should not be the concern of the Board. <em>See </em>Code (1957, 1998 RepLVol.), Art. 49B, \u00a7\u00a7 14-18. Simply because the Human Relations Commission may also have jurisdiction over a matter, however, is no indication that the matter is beyond the Board\u2019s authority. More than one administrative agency can have jurisdiction over a matter. <em>See, e.g., Insurance Commis</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number><em>sioner v. Equitable, </em>339 Md. 596, 604-605, 664 A.2d 862, 867 (1995); <em>Equitable Life v. State Comm\u2019n, </em>290 Md. 333, 430 A.2d 60 (1981); <em>Equitable Trust Co. v. State Comm\u2019n, </em>287 Md. 80, 411 A.2d 86 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"ARz\">This Court has emphasized that \u201csexual harassment in any context is patently unacceptable.\u201d <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Goldsborough, </em>330 Md. 342, 364, 624 A.2d 503, 514 (1993).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The Board of Physician Quality Assurance consists of 15 members, 11 of whom must be \u201cpracticing licensed physician[s].\u201d <em>See, </em>\u00a7 14-202(a) of the Health Occupations Article. Certainly the Board has a high degree of expertise in determining what constitutes unprofessional conduct \u201cin the practice of medicine.\u201d <em>Cf. Bd. of Ed. For Dorchester Co. v. Hubbard, supra, </em>305 Md. at 787-792, 506 A.2d at 631-634. The Board of Physician Quality Assurance is particularly well-qualified to decide, in a hospital setting, whether specified misconduct by a hospital physician is sufficiently intertwined with patient care to constitute misconduct in the practice of medicine. In light of the deference which a reviewing court should give to the Board\u2019s interpretation and application of the statute which the Board administers, we believe that the Board\u2019s decision in this case was warranted. When a hospital physician, while on duty, in the working areas of the hospital, sexually harasses other hospital employees who are attempting to perform their jobs, the Board can justifiably conclude <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>that the physician is guilty of immoral or unprofessional conduct in the practice of medicine.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-4\">\n<em>JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS AFFIRMED IN PART AND REVERSED IN PART, AND CASE REMANDED TO THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS WITH DIRECTIONS TO AFFIRM THE JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR CARROLL COUNTY.
