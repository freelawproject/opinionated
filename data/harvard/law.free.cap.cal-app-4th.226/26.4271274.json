L.Rev. 311, 336-337, fns. omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b58-5\">Appellant and defendant Konica Minolta Systems Laboratory, Inc. (KMSL), is a research and development subsidiary of a multinational corporation that, among other things, manufactures multifunction printers (also known as multifunction peripherals) (MFP\u2019s) and other devices with printing, scanning, and copying functions. Respondent and plaintiff Altavion, Inc. (Altavion), is a small company that invented a process for creating self-authenticating documents through the use of barcodes that contain encrypted data about the contents of the original documents. The trial court concluded that KMSL misappropriated trade secrets disclosed by Altavion during negotiations aimed at exploiting Altavion\u2019s technology. The negotiations were subject to a nondisclosure agreement and centered around the possibility of embedding Altavion\u2019s invention in one of KMSL\u2019s MFP\u2019s. During the negotiations, the invention was described as Altavion\u2019s \u201cdigital stamping technology\u201d (DST). After the negotiations failed, Altavion discovered KMSL had filed for patents encompassing Altavion\u2019s DST. Altavion brought suit and, following a bench trial, the trial court found KMSL misappropriated Altavion\u2019s trade secrets\u2014both Altavion\u2019s DST concept as a whole and specific DST design concepts. The court awarded Altavion damages, prejudgment interest, and attorney fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-6\">On appeal, KMSL contends it was improper for the trial court to base its ruling on misappropriation of Altavion\u2019s DST concept as a whole, and any other trade secrets the court found misappropriated were not adequately identified in the court\u2019s decision. KMSL further contends Altavion\u2019s DST was not protectable as a trade secret, either as a combination secret or as particular design concepts, because ideas and design concepts are not protect-able trade secrets. Moreover, KMSL contends Altavion did not show the ideas <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>were kept secret or had independent economic value. KMSL also challenges the trial court\u2019s award of damages, prejudgment interest, and attorney fees. We reject KMSL\u2019s contentions and affirm the trial court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-5\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b59-6\">From the voluminous record in the present case we set forth only those facts relevant to resolution of the issues on appeal. We recite the facts in the manner most favorable to the judgment and resolve all conflicts and draw all inferences in favor of respondent Altavion. <em>(SCI California Funeral Services, Inc. v. Five Bridges Foundation </em>(2012) 203 Cal.App.4th 549, 552-553 [137 Cal.Rptr.3d 693]; see <em>Pool v. City of Oakland </em>(1986) 42 Cal.3d 1051, 1056, fn. 1 [232 Cal.Rptr. 528, 728 P.2d 1163].) Conflicts in the evidence are noted only where pertinent to the issues on appeal. <em>(Pool, </em>at p. 1056, fn. 1; <em>SCI California Funeral Services, Inc., </em>at p. 553.)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b59-7\">\n<em>Altavion\u2019s DST</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b59-8\">Dr. Ali Moussa is the president and founder of Altavion. He founded Altavion in 2000 with the goal of developing DST to enable the self-authentication of digital and paper documents.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b59-9\">Altavion\u2019s DST was designed to encode the content of an original document into a small (maximum one inch by one inch) barcode (also called a \u201cstamp\u201d) printed on the document. In order to create the barcode, a scanned <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>version of the original document would be divided into cells and the pixel-level data about each cell would be represented in the barcode in a highly compressed form. By comparing the data encrypted in the barcode with a subsequent version of the document, Altavion\u2019s DST would show whether and where the document had been altered by searching for alterations at the pixel level. Because the barcode would permit the document to be authenticated without involvement of a third party, Altavion claimed its DST would create \u201cself-authenticating\u201d documents. Altavion\u2019s DST was implemented by software programmed to execute the algorithms necessary to perform the various barcode creation and authentication functions.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b60-4\">Altavion\u2019s barcode, and especially its color barcode, could contain far more data in a small space than existing barcodes. Grayscale or color barcodes, as compared to black-and-white barcodes, represent data with higher density, enabling more data to be represented in a given area. However, the development of a color barcode presented a distinct technical challenge because over time the colors on a printed barcode are subject to degradation, which can inhibit read back of the data contained in the barcode. Altavion resolved this problem by using \u201ccolor reference cells\u201d to aid in reconstruction of the encoded data. The company\u2019s implementation of the approach was unique, in that Altavion\u2019s barcode employed multiple reference cells for each color, and by an averaging process a range of values could be determined to represent each color.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-5\">\n<em>Altavion\u2019s Relationship with KMSL</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b60-6\">KMSL is a research and development company that develops technologies for its parent company, Konica Minolta Business Technologies, Inc., which, among other things, manufactures products including MFP\u2019s that can copy, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>scan, and print documents.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Some of the KMSL personnel involved in the events underlying this case include KMSL\u2019s president, Hiroshi Tomita, former consultant Paul Cattrone, computer scientist Dr. Wei Ming, and software engineer Vivek Pathak. Tomita handled the business negotiations with Altavion; Cattrone was hired in February 2004 to manage the digital stamping project; Ming helped evaluate Altavion\u2019s DST; and Pathak was hired in September 2004 to help develop KMSL\u2019s own DST.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-4\">Altavion was introduced to KMSL through William Zivic, a salesman employed at the time by Minolta Business Solutions. Although the terms of the agreement are unclear, in July 2003 Altavion and KMSL entered into a nondisclosure agreement (NDA), in which the companies agreed that any confidential information disclosed during their subsequent negotiations would be kept confidential.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Prior to discussions with Altavion, KMSL had no digital stamping projects in progress or products in development. Indeed, Tomita admitted \u201cthe first consideration [he] had ever given to [DST] was brought about by [his] discussions with Altavion.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b61-5\">KMSL\u2019s interest in Altavion\u2019s DST was in developing technology for authenticating printed documents, rather than for documents that remain only in a digital environment. For a variety of reasons, it is more difficult to authenticate printed documents than electronic documents (an issue known as the \u201cclosed loop problem\u201d). For example, an expert for KMSL at trial explained that problems can arise in the printing, storage, and scanning processes that make it more difficult to authenticate a paper document with a stamp.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-6\">In a December 15, 2003 letter to Moussa, Tomita wrote, \u201cAt [KMSL] we are studying using your unique technology for digital stamping for possible use in multiple applications in current and future products and for jointly developing it further for even better utilization.\u201d The parties sought to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>negotiate terms by which Altavion\u2019s DST could be embedded in a KMSL MFP. Altavion and KMSL discussed the possibility of a pay-per-stamp revenue model.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-4\">KMSL consultant Cattrone assessed evaluation software provided by Altavion and authored a report entitled \u201cAltavion Digital Stamping Software Evaluation.\u201d The report concluded, \u201cAltavion is the first available solution for creating a machine readable authentication barcode which can be later used to not only authenticate the document, but on false authenticity locate the areas within the document where tampering or alteration has occurred.\u201d In reporting the testing results, the report stated, \u201cIn all cases, the verification software was able to successfully authenticate unaltered digital documents. For most cases, when a document was found to be altered and not authentic, the software was able to successfully identify the areas within the document\u2014 graphic or text\u2014which had been tampered with.\u201d The report also identified further areas for evaluation and stated that Altavion\u2019s technology \u201cdoes contain a number of problems and functional anomalies in its current implementation in both the stamp creation and integrity checking software components.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b62-5\">A February 27, 2004 KMSL project development planning report (February 2004 planning report) articulated KMSL\u2019s project development strategy employing Altavion\u2019s DST. It stated, \u201cThis project will develop a Digital Stamping solution for use as a Konica-Minolta document authentication security technology. The solution will be built as two SDKs\u2014Digital Stamp Creation SDK and Digital Stamp Authentication &amp; Integrity Check SDK.[<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>] Both SDKs will be built around a digital stamping core functionality component. Altavion will provide the core functionality component as they have a patent pending digital stamping technology which can create and verify authentic documents as well as discover tamper locations in unauthentic documents. With Altavion technology a small amount of essential data extracted from the imago is required and can be encoded into a digital stamp as small as W x <em>V2\". </em>[KMSL] will drive the development of Altavion\u2019s core technology to provide Konica[-]Minolta with a solution that satisfies the basic requirements for creation and verification of a digitally stamped document.\u201d It also stated, \u201cBy developing [an] SDK around Altavion\u2019s digital stamping <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>core technology, Konica-Minolta will develop competing patentable technologies and marketable products which work to close the Printer/Scanner Loop to provide document authenticity and integrity validation regardless of digital or print form.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b63-4\">The February 2004 planning report distinguished Altavion\u2019s digital stamping process from a process patented by a competitor, Canon Inc., stating \u201cThe amount of data required to authenticate and verify integrity with the Altavion method is their key differentiating technology. Where as the Canon patent reduces the original document size in its approach to embed 2D barcodes, the Altavion solution does not apply any transformation to the original document as the stamp can be generated as small as <em>Vz\" </em>x <em>Vz\"\u201d </em>The February 2004 planning report also included a \u201c[p]atent application plan,\u201d indicating that \u201ca patent could be filed which describes an Altavion technology based method for creating self-authentic[ating] with embedded integrity data documents which can be authenticated from digital or print form.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b63-5\">In an April 1, 2004 e-mail, KMSL proposed to pay Altavion a fee for development of an SDK for a KMSL machine and further development of Altavion\u2019s grayscale and color barcodes. In e-mail communications on April 21 and 22, KMSL and Altavion discussed the possibility of a $400,000 fee, although it was contingent on an evaluation of Altavion\u2019s software. On April 27 and May 11, KMSL paid a total of $50,000 to Altavion for new evaluation software. The new software addressed some of the issues raised and enhancements requested in Cattrone\u2019s evaluation of the previous version of the software.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-6\">On August 31, 2004, KMSL and Altavion executed a memorandum of understanding (MOU), which stated that KMSL \u201cwill continue to recognize that Altavion\u2019s unique implementation of [DST] is Altavion\u2019s own intellectual property and will continue to protect [it].\u201d Unbeknownst to Altavion, even before execution of the MOU, KMSL had already begun filing a series of patent applications encompassing Altavion\u2019s DST.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Specifically, on June 28 and August 9, 2004, KMSL filed patent applications for color barcode producing methods, with KMSL\u2019s Ming listed as the inventor on the June application and Ming and Tomita listed as inventors on the August application. Both applications described a method \u201cto keep the integrity or authenticity of the color barcode\u201d through the use of color reference cells in the barcode. KMSL ultimately filed 24 United States DST patent applications, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>and eight United States patents were issued. The patents and applications identified varying combinations of Tomita, Ming, Cattrone, and Pathak as inventors.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-4\">The trial court ultimately found that KMSL \u201chad no idea, interest or information about DST ... or use of bar codes prior to their dealings with\u201d Altavion. Among other things, the trial court rejected as unreliable the meager evidence that Tomita and Ming independently developed the DST concepts reflected in KMSL\u2019s patents. KMSL does not dispute those findings on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-5\">In September 2004, shortly after execution of the MOU, KMSL hired software engineer Pathak to work on the digital stamping project and, specifically, to develop \u201cclosed loop technologies.\u201d Pathak had access to the evaluation software provided by Altavion. In a September 17 e-mail to Tomita, Cattrone said he had \u201casked [Pathak] to analyze the Altavion software and think about ways in which we can achieve similar results with the focus on a closed loop digital stamp.\u201d He also wrote, \u201c[Pathak] understands and knows well that there are many ways to achieve similar Altavion\u2019esque results within the digital domain.\u201d The e-mail also asserted there were problems in the relationship with Altavion. For example, Cattrone opined, \u201cIt is unlikely that we will get a digital stamping SDK from Altavion in the near future\u2014our signing of the MOU meant nothing to [Moussa].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b64-6\">KMSL and Altavion reached an impasse in their negotiations in the fall of 2004. The parties were unable to agree on the terms for KMSL\u2019s payment of a development fee to Altavion, or the scope of an SDK to be provided to KMSL.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-7\">\n<em>The Present Lawsuit</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b64-8\">In October 2006, Moussa learned about KMSL\u2019s patent filings. In November 2007,. Altavion filed the present lawsuit. In the second amended and operative complaint (Complaint), Altavion sued KMSL, Cattrone, and four other Konica Minolta entities (see fn. 4, <em>ante). </em>Altavion alleged causes of action for trade secret misappropriation, breach of the NDA, and a variety of other torts. KMSL filed a cross-complaint alleging (among other things) fraud based on Moussa\u2019s false statements that he had applied for patents.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-9\">By the time of trial, the only remaining Altavion causes of action were for breach of the NDA and for misappropriation of Altavion\u2019s trade secrets. The trial court issued a tentative statement of decision in July 2011 and a final statement of decision (FSOD) in November. The court ruled in favor of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>KMSL on Altavion\u2019s claim for breach of the NDA and in favor of Altavion on KMSL\u2019s fraud claim. Neither of those two claims is at issue on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-4\">The court found in favor of Altavion and against KMSL (but not against the other Konica Minolta defendants) on Altavion\u2019s misappropriation claim. The trial court awarded damages of $1 million and prejudgment interest of $513,400, for a total of $1,513,400. After further proceedings, the trial court awarded attorney fees to Altavion in the amount of $3,297,102.50, as well as amounts for expert fees and costs. The court also awarded costs to three of the Konica Minolta companies that had not been found liable for misappropriation.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b65-6\">I. <em>Summary of Trade Secret Law</em></p>\n<p id=\"b65-7\">In 1984, the Legislature \u201cadopted without significant change\u201d the Uniform Trade Secrets Act (UTSA) (Civ. Code, \u00a7 3426 et seq.).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <em>(DVD Copy Control, supra, </em>31 Cal.4th at p. 874; <em>Cadence Design Systems, Inc. v. Avant!

Nearly all states have adopted the UTSA; although there are some variations, case law applying UTSA enactments in other states is generally relevant in applying California\u2019s UTSA. <em>(K.C. Multimedia, Inc. v. Bank of America Technology &amp; Operations, Inc. </em>(2009) 171 Cal.App.4th 939, 955 [90 Cal.Rptr.3d 247]; Trade Secrets Practice in Cal., <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 1.2, p. 1-2.)</p>\n<p id=\"b65-8\">The UTSA \u201ccreates a statutory cause of action for the misappropriation of a trade secret.\u201d <em>(Brescia </em>v. <em>Angelin </em>(2009) 172 Cal.App.4th 133, 143 [90 Cal.Rptr.3d 842].) The statute defines a trade secret as \u201cinformation, including a formula, pattern, compilation, program, device, method, technique, or process, that: [][] (1) Derives independent economic value, actual or potential, from not being generally known to the public or to other persons who can obtain economic value from its disclosure or use; and [f] (2) Is the subject of efforts that are reasonable under the circumstances to maintain its secrecy.\u201d (\u00a7 3426.1, subd. (d).)<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> \u201cTrade secret misappropriation occurs whenever a person: (1) acquires another\u2019s trade secret with knowledge or reason to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>know \u2018that the trade secret was acquired by improper means\u2019 (\u00a7 3426.1, subd.

(b)(2)(C)).\u201d <em>(DVD Copy Control, supra, </em>31 Cal.4th at p. 874.)</p>\n<p id=\"b66-4\">In <em>DVD Copy Control, </em>the California Supreme Court outlined the purposes underlying the protections provided , by trade secret law. The court explained, \u201c \u2018[t]he basic logic of the common law of trade secrets recognizes that private parties invest extensive sums of money in certain information that loses its value when published to the world at large.\u2019 [Citation.] Based on this logic, trade secret law creates a property right \u2018defined by the extent to which the owner of the secret protects his interest from disclosure to others.\u2019 [Citation.] In doing so, it allows the trade secret owner to reap the fruits of its labor [citation] and protects the owner\u2019s \u2018moral entitlement to\u2019 these fruits [citation]. As such, \u2018trade secrets have been recognized as a constitutionally protected intangible property interest.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(DVD Copy Control, supra, </em>31 Cal.4th at p. 880.) As we noted at the outset of this decision, \u201c \u2018Trade secret law promotes the sharing of knowledge, and the efficient operation of industry; it permits the individual inventor to reap the rewards of his labor by contracting with a company large enough to develop and exploit it.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 878.) \u201cTrade secret law also helps maintain \u2018standards of commercial ethics . . . .\u2019 [Citation.] ... By sanctioning the acquisition, use, and disclosure of another\u2019s valuable, proprietary information by improper means, trade secret law minimizes \u2018the inevitable cost to the basic decency of society when one . . . steals from another.\u2019 [Citation.] In doing so, it recognizes that \u2018 \u201cgood faith and honest, fair dealing, is the very life and spirit of the commercial world.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 881.)</p>\n<p id=\"b66-5\">II. <em>Standard of Review</em></p>\n<p id=\"b66-6\">We review for substantial evidence the trial court\u2019s finding that KMSL misappropriated Altavion\u2019s trade secrets. <em>(Morlife, Inc. </em>v. <em>Perry </em>(1997) 56 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>Cal.App.4th 1514, 1521 [66 Cal.Rptr.2d 731] <em>(Morlife); Vacco Industries, Inc. v.

In the present case, Altavion identified the allegedly misappropriated trade secrets pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 2019.210 in a third amended identification (Amended Identification) dated May 20, 2009. On August 27, 2010, Altavion served KMSL with an \u201cOutline of Trade <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>Secrets Misappropriated by Defendants\u201d (Outline), which was admitted at trial as exhibit No. 1032. In the Outline, Altavion identified and detailed aspects of eight trade secrets (numbered IB, 1C, 2, 4, 7, 11, 12 &amp; 15). After the presentation of Altavion\u2019s case at trial, the trial court granted KMSL\u2019s motion for nonsuit as to misappropriation of trade secrets 7 and 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-4\">On appeal, KMSL asserts \u201cno trade secret was sufficiently identified to permit [KMSL] to present a meaningful defense.\u201d However, KMSL presents no reasoned argument with citations to authority <em>(Badie v. Bank of America </em>(1998) 67 Cal.App.4th 779, 784-785 [79 Cal.Rptr.2d 273]) that Altavion\u2019s Amended Identification or Outline were overly vague or otherwise failed to describe the allegedly misappropriated information with \u201csufficient particularity\u201d to separate it from matters of general knowledge and to permit KMSL to ascertain \u201cat least the boundaries within which the secret lies.\u201d <em>(Diodes, supra, </em>260 Cal.App.2d at p. 253; see <em>Advanced Modular Sputtering, Inc. </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>132 Cal.App.4th at pp. 835-836.) <em>Instead, </em>KMSL argues the trade secrets identified by Altavion were not the same as the trade secrets the trial court found misappropriated in the FSOD. In particular, KMSL focuses on the fact that, in identifying its trade secrets, Altavion largely did not use the phrase that was used by the trial court\u2014DST\u2014and specifically did not use the phrase in any of the numbered trade secrets still at issue at the conclusion of the trial. KMSL asserts, \u201c[i]nstead, the lists described a multitude of specific algorithms and process steps that Altavion claimed could be used to create barcodes or authenticate documents and which were allegedly implemented in its software.\u201d Arguing the trade secrets as described in the FSOD differ from those identified by Altavion is not, however, a claim that Altavion failed to comply with its statutory obligation to adequately identify its trade secrets either before or during trial. KMSL has not shown any error in that respect.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-5\">B. <em>The Trial Court Did Not Err in Its Identification of the Misappropriated Trade Secrets.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b69-6\">The heart of KMSL\u2019s claim on appeal is that it was improper for the trial court to base its ruling on misappropriation of Altavion\u2019s \u2018DST,\u2019 and that, otherwise, the trial court failed to adequately identify the trade secrets it found had been misappropriated.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-7\">A trial court\u2019s statement of decision must explain \u201cthe factual and legal basis for its decision as to each of the principal controverted issues at trial.\u201d (Code Civ.

It will be deemed adequate \u201cif it fairly discloses the determinations as to the ultimate facts and material issues in the case.\u201d <em>(Central Valley General Hospital </em>v. <em>Smith </em>(2008) 162 Cal.App.4th 501, 513 [75 Cal.Rptr.3d 771].) \u201cWhere [a] statement of decision sets forth the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>factual and legal basis for the decision, any conflict in the evidence or reasonable inferences to be drawn from the facts will be resolved in support of the determination of the trial court decision.\u201d <em>(In re Marriage of Hoffmeister </em>(1987) 191 Cal.App.3d 351, 358 [236 Cal.Rptr. 543]; accord, <em>Estate of Young </em>(2008) 160 Cal.App.4th 62, 75-76 [72 Cal.Rptr.3d 520].) \u201c[Fjindings of fact are liberally construed to support the judgment.\u201d <em>(Estate of Young, </em>at p. 76.)

Proc., \u00a7 634; see <em>SEEP v. Burlington Northern &amp; Santa Fe Ry. Co. </em>(2004) 121 Cal.App.4th 452, 462 [17 Cal.Rptr.3d 96].)</p>\n<p id=\"b70-4\">1. <em>The Trial Court\u2019s Analysis</em></p>\n<p id=\"b70-5\">In the FSOD the trial court frequently used the umbrella term DST to refer to the whole of Altavion\u2019s barcode technology. The court explained Altavion\u2019s DST was a method of creating \u201ca self-authenticating paper document, through the use of a digital stamp (which is also self-authenticating). It is \u2018unique,\u2019 according to [Altavion], in that it could detect alterations as well as show where the alterations had occurred in the document.\u201d The court further explained: \u201cA digital stamp is a type of bar code. DST is data represented as an image, [f] [Altavion\u2019s] bar code is not a miniature image of the entire document nor does it digitize all data in an entire document, called \u2018compression.\u2019 Rather, it is the \u2018thumbprint\u2019 of the document, a form of essential data, which can be used to self-authenticate the document as a true and correct copy of the original document. Part of this process is that the technology \u2018grids\u2019 the subject document into squares, and then selects reference information to create the barcode. [][] According to Moussa, [Altavion\u2019s] bar code has three main components: (1) Textual Data, which is the text in the bar code; (2) Statistical Data, which keeps the bar code within one inch by one inch in size . . . , and (3) Reference Data. [][] [Altavion\u2019s] technology allegedly does two things: (1) Authentication, i.e., Has the document been altered? and (2) Integrity, i.e., Where has the document been altered?\u201d The court also explained that, in 2002, Altavion created grayscale and color barcodes, which could hold more information than black-and-white barcodes of the same size. Altavion sought to partner with KMSL to embed Altavion\u2019s DST in one of KMSL\u2019s MFP\u2019s.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-6\">Prior to analyzing the evidence of misappropriation, the trial court acknowledged the parties had different purposes in developing DST. It explained that Altavion\u2019s \u201cfocus is a self-authenticating bar code that takes \u2018thumbprint\u2019 details from a document for purposes of double-checking document integrity and showing where (if anywhere) the document has been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>altered.\u201d On the other hand, KMSL\u2019s \u201cfocus is a bar code ... to preserve document integrity such that the document itself is preserved, so that the document text and images are not distorted by copying, scanning, printing, age or fading over time. The bar code is to preserve the document, including its text and images (and colors).\u201d Nevertheless, the court reasoned that \u201ctaking the idea of one person and using that same idea for another purpose does not make it the second person\u2019s \u2018new\u2019 idea.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b71-4\">The trial court ultimately found KMSL misappropriated Altavion\u2019s DST, especially through KMSL\u2019s patents. The court stated KMSL \u201cused one or more trade secrets of [Altavion] in attempting to create [KMSL\u2019s] own DST. Further the Court finds that, <em>at the very </em>least, [11 specified patents and patent applications] disclose or use a trade secret (or component part of a trade secret) of Altavion.\u201d The trial court described the secret information provided by Altavion to KMSL as \u201cinformation . . . regarding its DST technology.\u201d In addition to finding KMSL misappropriated Altavion\u2019s DST concept as a whole, it is also clear, as detailed below, the trial court found KMSL misappropriated particular design concepts identified in Altavion\u2019s Amended Identification and Outline, especially aspects of trade secrets IB, 1C, 2, and 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-5\">2. <em>Misappropriation of Altavion\u2019s DST as a Combination of Design Concepts</em></p>\n<p id=\"b71-6\">As explained above, the trial court found KMSL misappropriated Altavion\u2019s DST concept as a whole, both by using Altavion\u2019s DST in developing KMSL\u2019s own DST and by disclosing aspects of Altavion\u2019s DST in 11 of KMSL\u2019s patents and patent applications.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b71-7\">At the outset, we reject any contention that Altavion\u2019s DST concept on the whole was inherently not protectable as a trade secret. Because (as explained in pt. IV.B.2., <em>post) </em>the detailed design concepts underlying Altavion\u2019s DST were undisclosed, a finding of trade secret appropriation could be based on misappropriation of Altavion\u2019s DST concept as a whole. That is so because, even if some or all of the elements of Altavion\u2019s design were in the public domain and thus unprotectable, the <em>combination </em>was a protectable trade secret if it was secret and had independent economic value (see pt. IV.C., <em>post). </em>For example, in <em>Rivendell Forest Products </em>v. <em>Georgia-Pacific </em>(10th Cir. 1994) 28 F.3d 1042, 1043 the plaintiff lumber business alleged a competitor misappropriated a software system that permitted the plaintiff to provide special customer services and manage distribution. The Tenth Circuit concluded the trial court erred in requiring \u201cthat the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>software system be examined bit by bit with the further requirement that Rivendell demonstrate protectability of its elements or some of them rather than the protectability of the software system as a whole.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1045.) The court explained, \u201cthe doctrine has been established that a trade secret can include a system where the elements are in the public domain, but there has been accomplished an effective, successful and valuable integration of the public domain elements and the trade secret gave the claimant a competitive advantage which is protected from misappropriation.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1046; see <em>Harvey Barnett, Inc. v. Shidler </em>(10th Cir. 2003) 338 F.3d 1125, 1130 [reversing a district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment because it looked at the components of the plaintiff\u2019s infant swimming program \u201cin isolation, rather than as a whole, in determining that [plaintiff] does not possess a trade secret\u201d]; <em>3M v. Pribyl </em>(7th Cir. 2001) 259 F.3d 587, 595-596; <em>Integrated Cash Management Services v. Digital Transactions </em>(2d Cir. 1990) 920 F.2d 171, 174; <em>Imperial Chemical Industries Ltd. v. National Distillers &amp; Chemical Corp. </em>(2d Cir. 1965) 342 F.2d 737, 742.) Similarly, Altavion\u2019s implementation of DST was potentially protectable as a \u201ccombination of characteristics and component's\u201d <em>(3M v. Pribyl, </em>at p. 595), regardless of whether particular design concepts separately qualified for protection as trade secrets.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-4\">KMSL\u2019s primary argument on this point is that DST \u201cwas never identified [by Altavion] as a misappropriated trade secret\u201d and the trial court\u2019s finding that KMSL misappropriated Altavion\u2019s DST means the court found \u201c[KMSL] misappropriated something else that wasn\u2019t on the trial list.\u201d The thrust of the argument is that the trial court\u2019s finding of misappropriation of Altavion\u2019s DST was not \u201cfair\u201d and frustrated KMSL\u2019s right to \u201cmount a defense.\u201d It is true Altavion\u2019s Amended Identification and Outline did not identify \u201cDST\u201d as a combination trade secret, but it is disingenuous for KMSL to suggest it was unaware what the trial court meant in referring to Altavion\u2019s DST. As we noted earlier (fn. 2, <em>ante), </em>the parties regularly used the term \u201cDST\u201d during negotiations and during the litigation to describe the technology KMSL sought to obtain from Altavion. The Complaint alleges, in paragraph 13 of the general allegations, that Altavion \u201chas created and perfected a novel set of digital document security platform technologies, which are the first of their kind to provide the dual functionality of <em>document authentication </em>via the use of novel stamp embedding techniques and <em>document integrity assessment </em>via novel tamper detection techniques. [Altavion\u2019s] proprietary digital document security platform technologies are collectively referred to as Digital Stamping Technology (\u2018DST\u2019 or \u2018DST Platform\u2019).\u201d Paragraphs 48 and 49 of the misappropriation cause of action explained that Altavion\u2019s \u201cDST Platform\u201d and \u201cDST Solutions Suite\u201d were \u201ccollectively referred to as \u2018Trade Secrets,\u2019 \u201d and alleged the defendants \u201cmisappropriated portions of [Altavion\u2019s] DST <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>Trade Secrets by obtaining such Trade Secrets from Dr. Moussa and [Altavion] during discussions, negotiations, meetings and other communications.\u201d Accordingly, it is unmistakable the trial court used the phrase DST to refer to Altavion\u2019s secret barcode technology, taken as a whole, and there can be no question that KMSL understood what the trial court referred to in using the term DST.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-4\">Although the Amended Identification and the Outline did not list \u201cDST\u201d as a misappropriated trade secret, KMSL does not explain in what ways the concepts the court identified as Altavion\u2019s DST differ from the trade secret concepts identified by Altavion that were the subject of the proceedings in the case. KMSL does not show \u201cAltavion\u2019s DST\u201d as described in the FSOD differs from the digital stamping concepts described in Altavion\u2019s Complaint, Amended Identification, or Outline. Neither does KMSL show \u201cAltavion\u2019s DST\u201d as described in the FSOD differs from the digital stamping concepts that were the subject of evidence and argument presented at trial.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> In particular, KMSL has not demonstrated how it was prejudiced by the trial court\u2019s finding it misappropriated the \u201cforest\u201d of Altavion\u2019s DST as opposed to individual \u201ctrees\u201d referenced in Altavion\u2019s Amended Identification- and Outline. It is difficult to imagine what additional evidence KMSL could have presented to show it did not misappropriate Altavion\u2019s DST concept as a whole, since such misappropriation could be established by the evidence that KMSL made use of Altavion\u2019s DST in developing its own DST and DST patents.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b73-5\">KMSL denies this is \u201ca debate about semantics.\u201d However, absent a failure of proof supporting the trial court\u2019s findings, and absent legal authority and reasoned analysis why the trial court\u2019s findings deprived KMSL of a fair trial, KMSL has failed to show the trial court\u2019s determination it misappropriated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>Altavion\u2019s DST concept as a whole was reversible error. (See Cal. Const., art. VI, \u00a7 13 [\u201c[n]o judgment shall be set aside, or new trial granted, in any cause, ... for any error as to any matter of procedure, unless, after an examination of the entire cause, including the evidence, the court shall be of the opinion that the error complained of has resulted in a miscarriage of justice\u201d]; <em>Century Surety Co. v.

KMSL asserts the FSOD \u201cdoes not find\u2014and given the absence of any evidence could not have found\u2014that any alleged trade secret on Altavion\u2019s trial list meets the statutory definition of a \u2018trade secret.\u2019 \u201d KMSL is mistaken. Although the FSOD does not analyze each aspect of trade secrets IB, 1C, 2, 4, 12, and 15 and identify whether each of those aspects was misappropriated by KMSL, the FSOD <em>does </em>identify specific aspects of the identified trade secrets that were misappropriated by KMSL.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b74-6\">In the FSOD, the trial court described KMSL\u2019s patent applications and patents and then found, <em>\u201cat the very least. . . </em>Patent \u2019769 (and related Patent Application \u2019224), Patent \u2019855 (and related Patent Application \u2019229), Patent \u2019865 (and related Patent Application \u2019563), Patent Application \u2019608, Patent Application \u2019621, Patent Application \u2019035, and Patent Application \u2019138 disclose or use a trade secret (or component part of a trade secret) of Altavion.\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b74-7\">The FSOD describes patent application \u2019608 as a method to preserve the integrity of barcode colors through the use of color reference cells, demonstrating the trial court found KMSL misappropriated Altavion\u2019s idea for using color reference cells to preserve the integrity of the colors of the barcode.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>Patent application \u2019608 describes \u201can apparatus and a method to keep the integrity or authenticity of the color barcode. Such is accomplished by the color information portion of the color barcode representing the color information about what colors are used for color tiles of data portion of the color barcode and an apparatus and a method for producing and reproducing such color barcode.\u201d The FSOD also describes KMSL\u2019s patent application \u2019347 and related patent \u2019817, which also relate to color barcodes using color reference cells, including color averaging. Altavion\u2019s trade secrets IB, 2, and 12 relate to its process for creating a color barcode with color reference cells and color averaging.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-4\">The trial court\u2019s findings also reflect its determination that KMSL\u2019s patent applications and patents misappropriated other aspects of Altavion\u2019s DST design, including at least the process steps of scanning a page to locate blank space available to locate a barcode (patent \u2019769 and related patent application \u2019224; patent application \u2019035); partitioning the image of a document into a grid of cells (patent \u2019865 and related patent application \u2019563); using compression to encode data representing a document\u2019s contents in a digital stamp (patent application \u2019035; patent \u2019769 and'related patent application \u2019224; and patent \u2019855 and related patent application \u2019229); and, in detail, using a barcode to authenticate a document by detecting alterations and indicating the locations of the alterations (patent application \u2019621 and patent application \u2019035).<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> In language very much echoing Altavion\u2019s DST, patent application \u2019035 (entitled \u201cMethod and Apparatus for Authenticating Printed Documents\u201d) describes how a printed document bearing an authentication barcode is self-authenticating because when scanned the document\u2019s contents may be \u201ccompared to the authentication data to determine if any part of the printed document has been altered since it was originally printed (i.e. whether the document is authentic) and what the alterations are. A printed document bearing [an] authentication barcode is said to be self-authenticating because no information other than what is on the printed document is required to authenticate its content.\u201d Altavion\u2019s trade secrets IB, 1C, and 2 relate to these processes.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b76-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>Accordingly, contrary to KMSL\u2019s assertions on appeal, the FSOD does identify particular DST design concepts that the trial court found were misappropriated.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b76-5\">4. <em>Conclusion Regarding Adequacy of the FSOD</em></p>\n<p id=\"b76-6\">The degree of specificity required in the identification of misappropriated trade secrets in a statement of decision depends on the nature of the case.

Because the trial court found that KMSL misappropriated Altavion\u2019s DST concept as a whole, and also identified particular trade secret ideas that were misappropriated by KMSL in its patents and patent applications, the trade secret identification in the FSOD was adequate.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b76-7\">IV. <em>Did Altavion\u2019s DST Design Concepts Constitute Protectable Trade Secrets?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b76-8\">As noted previously, the UTS A defines a \u201c \u2018[t]rade secret\u2019 \u201d as \u201cinformation, including a formula,, pattern, compilation, program, device, method, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>technique, or process, that: [][] (1) Derives independent economic value, actual or potential, from not being generally known to the public or to other persons who can obtain economic value from its disclosure or use; and [f] (2) Is the subject of efforts that are reasonable under the circumstances to maintain its secrecy.\u201d (\u00a7 3426.1, subd.

IV.B., <em>post), </em>the trade secret information at issue in the present case is principally comprised of the design concepts underlying Altavion\u2019s DST. In the words of the trial court, \u201cthe issue is whether [KMSL\u2019s] ideas set forth in the patents and patent applications are founded upon and disclose any trade secret \u2018ideas\u2019 [it] learned from [Altavion].\u201d Because the trade secret information at issue in this case is a set of ideas rather than a set of products or specific formulae, it is important to address KMSL\u2019s assertion in its brief on appeal that \u201c[generalized ideas and inventions are protectable by patents and thus cannot be trade secrets.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b77-7\">Although KMSL fails to provide a citation for that assertion, KMSL proceeds to quote language in <em>Silvaco </em>drawing a distinction between patent law and trade secret law. <em>Silvaco </em>explained, \u201cThe sine qua non of a trade secret... is the plaintiff\u2019s possession of information of a type that can, at the possessor\u2019s option, be made known to others, or withheld from them, i.e., kept secret. This is the fundamental difference between a trade secret and a patent. A patent protects an <em>idea, </em>i.e., an invention, against appropriation by others. Trade secret law does not protect ideas as such. Indeed a trade secret may consist of something we would not ordinarily consider an <em>idea </em>(a conceptual datum) at all, but more a <em>fact </em>(an empirical datum), such as a customer\u2019s preferences, or the location of a mineral deposit. In either case, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>the trade secret is not the idea or fact itself, but <em>information </em>tending to communicate (disclose) the idea or fact to another. Trade secret law, in short, protects only <em>the right to control the dissemination of information.\u201d (Silvaco, supra, </em>184 Cal.App.4th 210 at pp. 220-221.)<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b78-4\">In isolation, the statement \u201c[t]rade secret law does, not protect ideas as such\u201d <em>(Silvaco, supra, </em>184 Cal.App.4th at p. 220) is easily misunderstood. In fact, <em>Silvaco </em>plainly does <em>not </em>hold\" that secret ideas are not protectable under trade secret law, and KMSL cites no authority for its apparent claim that the definition of \u201cinformation\u201d in section 3426.1, subdivision (d), excludes patentable ideas. The court in <em>Sinclair v. Aquarius Electronics, Inc., supra, </em>42 Cal.App.3d 216, explained the overlap between trade secret law and patent law as follows: \u201c[A]lthough a trade secret may be a device or process which is patentable, patentability is not a condition precedent to the classification of a trade secret. Thus, it has been said that a trade secret may be a device or process which is clearly anticipated in the prior art or one which is merely a mechanical improvement on a machine or device. Novelty and invention are not requisite for a trade secret as they are for patentability [citation]. In harmony with these precepts, it has been held that <em>a trade secret in the broad sense consists of any unpatented idea which may be used for industrial and commercial purposes </em>[citation].\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 222, italics added, citing <em>Painton &amp; Co. </em>v. <em>Bourns, Inc. </em>(2d Cir. 1971) 442 F.2d 216, 222; accord, <em>Rigging Internat.

The secret may leak, or other circumstances may arise that frustrate the inventor\u2019s right to obtain a patent. <em>(Kewanee Oil Co. v. Bicron Corp., supra, </em>416 U.S. at p. 490; <em>Painton &amp; Co. v. Bourns, Inc., supra, </em>442 F.2d at p. 224.) Nevertheless, the \u201clong-standing principle\u201d is \u201cthat an inventor who chooses to exploit his invention by private arrangements is entirely free to do so, though in so doing he may thereby forfeit his right to a patent.\u201d <em>(Painton &amp; Co., </em>at p. 225; see <em>ibid, </em>[\u201cinventor \u2018may keep his invention secret and reap its fruits indefinitely\u2019 \u201d]; <em>Sinclair v. Aquarius Electronics, Inc., supra, </em>42 Cal.App.3d at p. 223 [\u201calthough a trade secret does not give its owner any monopoly and once contracted away is subject to being copied, the inventor is entirely free to keep his idea secret and not to divulge it to the general public . . .\u201d]; <em>Learning Curve Toys, Inc. </em>v. <em>PlayWood Toys, Inc. </em>(7th Cir. 2003) 342 F.3d 714, 727 <em>(Learning Curve) </em>[stating it is \u201cirrelevant that PlayWood did not seek to patent its concept\u201d].) Indeed, as a leading scholar has observed, because a \u201csubstantial number of patents\u201d are invalidated by the courts, resulting in disclosure of an invention to competitors with no benefit, \u201cmany businesses now elect to protect commercially valuable information through reliance upon the state law of trade secret protection.\u201d (1 Milgrim on Trade Secrets, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 1.01 [2][a], p. 1-36.)<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b79-6\">In conclusion, it is clear that if a patentable idea is kept secret, the idea itself can constitute information protectable by trade secret law. In that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>situation, trade secret law protects the inventor\u2019s <em>\u201cright to control the dissemination of </em>information\u201d <em>(Silvaco, supra, </em>184 Cal.4th at p. 221)\u2014the information being the idea itself\u2014rather than the subsequent use of the novel technology, which is protected by patent law <em>(Cadence Design Systems, Inc. v. Avant! Corp., supra, </em>29 Cal.4th at p. 222). In other words, trade secret law may be used to sanction the misappropriation of an idea the plaintiff kept secret. (See, e.g., <em>Learning Curve, supra, </em>342 F.3d at p. 721 [misappropriation of \u201cconcept\u201d for noise-producing toy railroad track]; <em>Contour Design, Inc. v. Chance Mold Steel Co. </em>(D.N.H., Jan. 14, 2010, No. 09-cv-451-JL) 2010 WL 174315 [misappropriation of ergonomic mouse \u201cconcept\u201d].) This is consistent with the proposition that \u201cThe sine qua non of a trade secret... is the plaintiff\u2019s possession of information of a type that can, at the possessor\u2019s option, be made known to others, or withheld from them, i.e., kept secret.\u201d <em>(Silvaco, </em>at p. 220.)</p>\n<p id=\"b80-4\">B. <em>Design Concepts Underlying Altavion\u2019s DST Constitute Protectable \u201cInformation. \u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b80-5\">As explained in greater detail <em>post, </em>the information at issue in the present case can readily be divided into three tiers of specificity and secrecy. The least specific and least secret level of information is Altavion\u2019s general idea for a barcode allowing for self-authentication of documents with identification of alterations. This level of information is not a protectable trade secret because the general idea was disclosed to other companies without the benefit of an NDA. At the other extreme, the most specific and secret level of information includes Altavion\u2019s algorithms and source code that execute Altavion\u2019s DST.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> Such information is unquestionably protectable by trade secret law, but it could not form the basis for Altavion\u2019s misappropriation claim because Altavion did not share its algorithms and source codes with KMSL.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-6\">The middle tier of information is comprised of the design concepts that underlie Altavion\u2019s DST, many of which might be evident to a software end user. There is no evidence such information was disclosed to anyone other than KMSL, pursuant to an NDA, and, thus, misappropriation of these secret design concepts (separately and in combination) provides a basis for Altavion\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>1. <em>Altavion\u2019s General DST Idea Was Not Secret.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b81-4\">Secrecy is an essential characteristic of information that is protect-able as a trade secret. <em>(Ruckelshaus </em>v. <em>Monsanto Co. </em>(1984) 467 U.S. 986, 1002 [81 L.Ed.2d 815, 104 S.Ct. 2862]; <em>DVD Copy Control, supra, 31 </em>Cal.4th at p. 881; <em>Silvaco, supra, </em>184 Cal.App.4th at pp. 220-221; see Lemley, <em>The Surprising Virtues of Treating Trade Secrets as IP Rights, supra, </em>61 Stan. L.Rev. at pp. 342-344.) KMSL contends Altavion failed to show it made \u201creasonable\u201d efforts (\u00a7 3426.1, subd. (d)(2)) to protect the secrecy of its purported trade secrets because Altavion disclosed its secrets to others without the protection of an NDA. It is well established that \u201c \u2018[i]f an individual discloses his trade secret to others who are under no obligation to protect the confidentiality of the information, or otherwise publicly discloses the secret, his property right is extinguished.\u2019 \u201d <em>(In re Providian Credit Card Cases </em>(2002) 96 Cal.App.4th 292, 304 [116 Cal.Rptr.2d 833], quoting <em>Ruckelshaus, </em>at p. 1002; see <em>DVD Copy Control, </em>at p. 881.) KMSL points to evidence it argues demonstrates that Altavion disclosed its DST concept to several entities without assurances of confidentiality. It asserts, \u201cAltavion did not treat \u2018DST\u2019 or its \u2018digital stamping technology\u2019 as a secret or confidential\u2014to the contrary, it showed it to anyone who might be interested in doing business with Altavion.\u201d We conclude the evidence of disclosure does not undermine the trial court\u2019s finding that Altavion made reasonable efforts to maintain the secrecy of its DST, because the evidence shows Altavion disclosed only its <em>general </em>DST concept, not the underlying design details.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-5\">The first disclosure of Altavion\u2019s general DST concept involved a demonstration by Altavion of its black-and-white barcode in Saudi Arabia to the Saudi Chamber of Commerce in September 2002. Altavion did not have an NDA with that group. Moussa testified he demonstrated document authorization with a black-and-white stamp as embodied in trade secret 1A. Trade secret 1A, which is a method for \u201ccaptur[ing] document text as it is being created in real-time and encoding] it into a barcode,\u201d was not one of the secrets for which Altavion claimed misappropriation at trial. Moreover, Moussa testified he demonstrated the creation of a barcode using this method, but he never explained how it was done or \u201cthe details of doing it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b81-6\">The second disclosure of Altavion\u2019s general DST concept involved a June 2003 demonstration by Altavion to KMSL of \u201cpaper stamp software\u201d embodying trade secrets 1C, 4, and 12. Altavion and KMSL had not yet executed an NDA. But Moussa explained that the software demonstration showed the results of the process, but not the steps or details of how to make the stamp. He explained it \u201cwas just to show to them results rather than to explain details. . . . And that is needed when you sell something, otherwise you will continue to keep it for yourself and not being <em>[sic] </em>able to sell <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>anything.\u201d He further explained' that confidential information for Altavion \u25a0 \u201cmeans the details of making things to work. . . . [Y]ou have to show other people as well on the surface what we have so that at least you attracted the attention for possible relationships. So, these things which appears on the surface is not confidential. I\u2019ve showed you ... a picture .... The picture itself is the result of applying that trade secret for it to appear. If people are interested in that picture, then we are more than happy to sit down and have an agreement with them and start to explain what we have, if it will lead to commercial[ly] beneficial . . . relationships.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b82-4\">The third disclosure of Altavion\u2019s general DST concept occurred when a salesperson named Phil Thoren made a presentation to testing company Harcourt Educational Measurement regarding Altavion\u2019s DST, apparently without an NDA. Moussa admitted the presentation was based on information obtained from Altavion, but he denied authorizing the presentation. The presentation to Harcourt stated that \u201cDocument Stamping is a mechanism to bind the content, physical and digital signatures and user authentication in both electronic file and paper form.\u201d The presentation described the size of the stamp; that the stamp contains a time stamp, image metadata, and a digital signature; and that the stamp \u201cDetects any change\u201d with \u201cSingle Pixel resolution @ 8 bit grayscale color depth.\u201d As noted previously, there is no indication the trial court found that KMSL misappropriated trade secret 4, which related to the application of DST to test forms. (See fn. 18, <em>ante.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b82-5\">In the fourth disclosure of Altavion\u2019s general DST concept, Moussa, in June 2005, sent Microsoft a presentation about Altavion\u2019s DST without the protection of an NDA. The presentation described Altavion\u2019s process for producing \u201c[s]elf-[a]uthenticated [djocuments\u201d with the ability to detect and identify alterations. A page captioned \u201cWhat is Inside a Stamp?\u201d contained an image of an Altavion barcode on a document, a blownup image of the barcode, and an indication that the barcode contained \u201c[d]ocument metadata\u201d and \u201c[administrative [d]ata,\u201d with examples of types of administrative data, such as .a time stamp or an account number.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-6\">Finally, in May 2006, Moussa e-mailed a presentation regarding Altavion\u2019s DST to Wachovia Bank without the protection of an NDA. Moussa testified the presentation showed images of Altavion\u2019s barcode on documents, and a \u201c[g]lobal view of what the barcode will contain.\u201d The presentation also asserted the barcode would permit alterations to be detected and identified.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-7\">Thus, the evidence in the record demonstrates that, although Altavion disclosed to several entities its general concept for implementation of DST, it did not provide details about the design concepts underlying its DST, much less provide demonstration software as it did to KMSL. Accordingly, although Altavion could not base its misappropriation claim on its <em>general </em>DST <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>concept, Altavion\u2019s disclosures did not preclude a determination that the <em>design concepts underlying </em>Altavion\u2019s general DST concept are protectable trade secrets.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-4\">2. <em>Design Concepts Underlying Altavion\u2019s DST Are Protectable.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b83-5\">The two other levels of information arguably at issue in the present case are the most secret level\u2014Altavion\u2019s algorithms and source code\u2014and the middle tier of information, comprised of the design concepts underlying Altavion\u2019s DST. The record shows Altavion did not disclose those levels of information to other companies. The record also shows that, although it is well established that source code can constitute a protectable trade secret (see, e.g., <em>Cadence Design Systems, Inc. </em>v. <em>Avant! Corp., supra, </em>29 Cal.4th at p. 219; <em>Silvaco, supra, </em>184 Cal.App.4th at pp. 221-222), Altavion did <em>not </em>disclose its source code and algorithms to KMSL. Accordingly, the information at issue in the present case is the <em>design concepts underlying </em>Altavion\u2019s DST, which Altavion kept secret from other companies but indisputably disclosed to KMSL subject to an NDA.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b83-6\">KMSL argues Altavion\u2019s DST design concepts are not protectable trade secrets, characterizing <em>Silvaco, supra, </em>184 Cal.App.4th at pages 221-222,. as standing for the proposition that \u201calthough a finished product might have distinctive characteristics resulting from a specific design, those characteristics cannot constitute trade secrets.\u201d KMSL is mistaken. <em>Silvaco </em>merely held that the design of a software program is not a trade secret <em>to the extent the design elements are disclosed and evident to the end user. </em>The plaintiff in that case, Silvaco, was the developer of software used to design electronic circuits and systems. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 216.) Silvaco filed suit against the defendant, Intel, alleging Intel had misappropriated certain trade secrets used by Silvaco in its software. <em>(Ibid.) </em>\u201cThe primary gist of the claims was that Intel had used software acquired from another software concern with knowledge that Silvaco had accused that concern of incorporating source code, stolen from Silvaco, in its products.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 215-216.) The main issue in the case was whether Intel could be liable for misappropriation of Silvaco\u2019s source code where it never had access to the actual source code. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 220.) As relevant to the present case, <em>Silvaco </em>also held that one category of purported trade secrets\u2014described as \u201cvarious features, functions, and characteristics of the design and operation of Silvaco\u2019s software products\u201d\u2014did not include trade secrets at all. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 221.) That was because those software design concepts ceased to be protectable trade secrets to the extent the finished <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>program disclosed the underlying design. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 222.) As <em>Silvaco </em>explained, \u201cThe design may constitute the <em>basis </em>for a trade secret, such that <em>information concerning it </em>could be actionably misappropriated; but it is the information\u2014not the design itself\u2014that must form the basis for the cause of action. And while the finished (compiled) product might have distinctive characteristics resulting from that design\u2014such as improved performance\u2014 they cannot constitute trade secrets because they are not secret, but are evident to anyone running the finished program.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 221-222.)</p>\n<p id=\"b84-4\">Thus, <em>Silvaco </em>makes a distinction between source code and software design concepts, concluding design concepts are not protected by trade secret law where they can be ascertained by the end software user. A California federal district court summarized <em>Silvaco </em>on this issue as follows: \u201cPlans, flows, inputs, outputs, rules of operation, priorities of operation, and the like are not trade secrets to the extent they are manifest in the way a program works. [Citation.] In other words, background information comprising, for example, the features and functions, the business requirements and the high level design specifications that are incorporated into software and are evident in the operation of the software are not trade secrets. While source code is undoubtedly a trade secret, the way the source code <em>works </em>when compiled and run is not.\u201d <em>(Agency Solutions.Com, LLC v. TriZetto Group, Inc., supra, </em>819 F.Supp.2d at p. 1017; see <em>id. </em>at pp. 1019-1021 [following <em>Silvaco </em>in rejecting claims that software workflow processes that would be apparent to users are trade secrets]; <em>IDX Systems Corp. v. Epic Systems Corp., supra, </em>285 F.3d at p. 584 [\u201cdetails that ordinary users of the software could observe\u201d are not trade secrets]; <em>LinkCo, Inc. v. Fujitsu Ltd. </em>(S.D.N.Y.. 2002) 230 F.Supp.2d 492, 499 [holding, as a matter of law, that the plaintiff had not established the existence of a trade secret where the alleged secret was only the \u201csoftware architecture,\u201d which \u201ccannot remain secret once it is marketed\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b84-5\">Although <em>Silvaco </em>supports the proposition that <em>disclosed </em>software design concepts are not trade secrets, \u201cA potent distinction exists between a trade secret which <em>will </em>be disclosed if and when the product in which it is embodied is placed on sale, and a \u2018trade secret\u2019 embodied in a product which has been placed on sale, which product admits of discovery of the \u2018secret\u2019 upon inspection, analysis, or reverse engineering.\u201d (1 Milgrim on Trade Secrets, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 1.05[4], p. 1-338.1 (rel. 102-5/2013); accord, <em>Learning Curve, supra, </em>342 F.3d at p. 729.) Consistent with that proposition, cases have extended trade secret protection to computer programs and aspects of computer programs that the plaintiffs kept confidential. For example, in <em>Integrated Cash Management Services </em>v. <em>Digital Transactions, supra, </em>920 F.2d 171, the plaintiff alleged that former employees misappropriated the design and \u201c \u2018architecture\u2019 \u201d of the plaintiff\u2019s computer programs in creating a program for another company. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 172.) The appellate court extended <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>trade secret protection to \u201cthe manner in which several non-secret utility programs are arranged to create\u201d the plaintiff\u2019s \u201ccomputer software product.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 171.) The court noted that the manner in which the plaintiff\u2019s programs interacted was not generally known or readily ascertainable, and that the combination of programs \u201cwas not disclosed in [the plaintiff\u2019s] promotional literature, which contains merely a user-oriented description of the advantages of [the plaintiff\u2019s] product.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 174.)</p>\n<p id=\"b85-4\">Similarly, in <em>Burroughs Payment Systems, Inc. v.

The plaintiff alleged the defendant, a competitor, had used the diagnostic software in servicing the plaintiff\u2019s customers\u2019 equipment. <em>(Ibid.) </em>Applying California\u2019s UTS A, the federal district court held the plaintiff had properly alleged the existence of a trade secret because \u201cthe trade secrets at issue are not by necessity available to the public once the software (or the equipment containing it) is placed on the market; rather they can only be accessed by authorized individuals by entering a password.\u201d <em>(Burroughs, </em>at p. *15, italics omitted.)

We disagree. As explained in part IV.B., <em>ante, </em>the evidence showed that Altavion kept secret all but the most general idea for its DST. Moussa testified he was not aware of any barcodes in existence when he started Altavion in 2002 that could hold the desired amount of data, he was not aware of other barcodes that allowed for the creation of self-authenticating documents, and Altavion invented its unique implementation of color reference cells. Moreover, the trial court could reasonably infer Altavion\u2019s DST was not generally known or readily ascertainable from Moussa\u2019s testimony regarding the company\u2019s investment in developing the technology. The court could also make that inference based on KMSL\u2019s internal documents extolling the novelty of Altavion\u2019s DST. Finally, the trial court could reasonably infer that Altavion\u2019s DST was not generally known from the fact that KMSL obtained patents based on the technology (see pt. III.B.3., <em>ante). </em>The Patent Act provides for issuance of a patent to a person who \u201cinvents or discovers any new and useful . . . composition of matter, or any new and useful improvement thereof.\u201d (35 U.S.C. \u00a7 101; see <em>Bilski v. Kappos </em>(2010) 561 U.S. 593 [177 L.Ed.2d 792, 130 S.Ct. 3218, 3225].) Thus, where a party obtains a patent based on information claimed to be a trade secret, the fact of the patent itself is some evidence showing the information was not generally known.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b87-4\">KMSL also argues there was no evidence supporting the trial court\u2019s finding that Altavion\u2019s DST had potential economic value. Revealingly, KMSL does not make any serious effort to argue that advancements in DST in general, or Altavion\u2019s advancements in particular, lack inherent economic value. Any such contention would be belied by the serious interest KMSL showed in Altavion\u2019s DST and the effort KMSL put into obtaining patents covering Altavion\u2019s DST. On this issue, the trial court stated, \u201cThat it has at least \u2018potential\u2019 \u2018economic value\u2019 is demonstrated by the fact that [KMSL] engaged in filing multiple patent applications on bar code technology after learning from [Altavion].\u201d (See <em>Enterprise Manufacturing Co. </em>v. <em>Shakespeare Co. </em>(6th Cir. 1944) 141 F.2d 916, 920 [\u201cThe argument of appellee that the improvement disclosed in the patent under consideration was without value, or of only nominal value, was rightly rejected. The appellee, by infringing use, has paid tribute to the utility of the device infringed.\u201d].) We agree this is relevant circumstantial evidence of value, and KMSL cites to no contrary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>authority. The patents themselves have some potential value to KMSL, both because they protect the company\u2019s use of the DST described therein and because KMSL could charge others for a license to make use of the DST.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b88-4\">Furthermore, there is evidence Altavion invested substantial time and effort in developing its DST. In particular, Moussa testified Altavion\u2019s eight to 10 software engineers developed the black-and-white document authentication barcode over a period of four or five months, starting in February 2002, and the company finished development of the color barcode in December 2002 or January 2003. There was also evidence KMSL paid Altavion $50,000 for evaluation software; invested staff time in trying to develop a deal with Altavion; and devoted resources to analyzing the Altavion software in order to develop its own DST that would, in the words of Cattrone, achieve \u201cAltavion\u2019esque\u201d results. All of these investments of resources support the court\u2019s finding. (See <em>Courtesy Temporary Service, Inc. </em>v. <em>Camacho </em>(1990) 222 Cal.App.3d 1278, 1287 [272 Cal.Rptr. 352] [holding that \u201ca customer list procured by substantial time, effort, and expense is a protectable trade secret\u201d]; accord, <em>ReadyLink Healthcare v. Cotton </em>(2005) 126 Cal.App.4th 1006, 1020 [24 Cal.Rptr.3d 720]; see also <em>Mattel, Inc. </em>v. <em>MGA Entertainment, Inc. </em>(C.D.Cal. 2010) 782 F.Supp.2d 911, 972 [\u201c[independent economic value can be evidenced by \u2018circumstantial evidence of the resources invested in . producing the information\u2019 \u201d]; cf. <em>Learning Curve, supra, </em>342 F.3d at p. 728 [although \u201csignificant expenditure of time and/or money in the production of information may provide evidence of value . . . ,\u201d it is not required].) Finally, Moussa\u2019s secrecy (see pt. IV.B., <em>ante) </em>regarding the details of Altavion\u2019s DST reflects Moussa\u2019s own assessment of the information\u2019s value, which further supports the trial court\u2019s finding. (See <em>Morlife, supra, </em>56 Cal.App.4th at p. 1522 [a company\u2019s effort to maintain the secrecy of information is \u201can important factor in establishing the value which was placed on the information and that it could not be readily derived from publicly available sources\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b88-5\">Finally, there was evidence before the trial court that, if successfully implemented, DST could be very lucrative because of potential applications in many different industries. A June 2005 marketing consultant\u2019s report prepared for KMSL emphasized the worldwide impacts of document fraud and discussed the potential to apply document authentication methods in trade, national security, immigration, government documentation, pharmaceutical, casino, and a range of other industries and contexts. It stated there was a need to develop \u201cnew methods of document authenticity\u201d to address the problem of easy digital manipulation of documents. Former Minolta Business Solutions salesman Zivic testified he thought the \u201cpay-per-scan\u201d concept <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>using Altavion\u2019s DST was a \u201cremarkable opportunity\u201d that provided a \u201cvery unique differentiator among all copier manufacturers.\u201d He also referred to the Altavion deal as the \u201cbiggest opportunity\u201d he had ever worked on, because the technology had the potential to earn vast sums on check scanning in the banking industry.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-4\">Although the trial court found it is \u201cdisputed whether [Altavion\u2019s DST] actually works in the physical world, as opposed to in theory or only in the digital world,\u201d the long-term lucrative potential of DST supports a finding that the incremental advancements in the field represented by the concepts misappropriated by KMSL have independent economic value. In particular, the fact that Altavion\u2019s DST is not incorporated into a product on the market does not preclude a finding of independent economic value. (See \u00a7 3426.1, subd. (d)(1) [\u201cpotential\u201d value]; 1 Milgrim on Trade Secrets, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 1.01 [2][a], p. 1-47 [quoting commentary to UTSA that \u201c[t]he broader definition in the proposed Act extends protection to a plaintiff who has not yet had an opportunity or acquired the means to put a trade secret to use\u201d]; see also <em>Leatt Corp. v. Innovative Safety Technology, LLC </em>(S.D.Cal., Apr. 15, 2010, No. 09-CV-1301-IEG (POR)) 2010 WL 1526382, p. *5 [design features of neck safety brace prototype have independent economic value].) A concept can have enough value to justify trade secret protection even if further refinement and development is required before a product based on the concept can be brought to market. <em>(Learning Curve, supra, </em>342 F.3d at p. 726; see <em>Mattel, Inc. v. MGA Entertainment, Inc., supra, </em>782 F.Supp.2d at p. 962 [\u201c[cjoncepts can have value independent from the product they eventually inspire\u201d].) For the same reasons, the fact that KMSL did not misappropriate the DST source code did not preclude a finding that Altavion\u2019s DST concept had independent value.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-5\">All of the above analysis on the independent economic value element is applicable to both Altavion\u2019s DST viewed as a protectable combination of elements and to the previously identified specific design concepts underlying Altavion\u2019s DST. (See pt. III.B., <em>ante.) </em>Regarding the misappropriated design concepts, because those concepts represented the heart of Altavion\u2019s DST concept as a whole, it was reasonable for the trial court to infer that the potential economic value was ascribable to those elements. Substantial evidence supports the court\u2019s finding that Altavion showed its alleged trade secrets had independent economic value.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-6\">D. <em>Conclusion Regarding Merits of Misappropriation Claim</em></p>\n<p id=\"b89-7\">The trial court\u2019s finding that KMSL misappropriated Altavion\u2019s trade secrets is amply supported by the evidence in the record and the relevant legal authorities. As Altavion sought to commercialize its innovative DST <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>with the assistance of KMSL, to the expected mutual benefit of both companies (and society as a whole, had a marketable product been achieved), Altavion was entitled to the protections afforded by trade secret law alluded to at the beginning of this opinion. When KMSL secretly filed patent applications disclosing Altavion\u2019s ideas, and subsequently obtained patents covering Altavion\u2019s ideas, it was a classic violation of trade secret law. The trial court did not err in its misappropriation finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-4\">V. <em>Trial Court\u2019s Damages Award</em></p>\n<p id=\"b90-5\">The UTSA authorizes compensatory damages (1) \u201cfor the actual loss caused by misappropriation\u201d; (2) \u201cfor the unjust enrichment caused by misappropriation that is not taken into account in computing damages for actual loss\u201d; and (3) if \u201cneither damages nor unjust enrichment caused by misappropriation are provable, the court may order payment of a reasonable royalty.\u201d (\u00a7 3426.3, subds. (a) &amp; (b); <em>Ajaxo Inc. v. E*Trade Financial Corp. </em>(2010) 187 Cal.App.4th 1295, 1308-1309, 1312-1313 [115 Cal.Rptr.3d 168] (Ajaxo); see <em>K.C.

Burroughs Corp. </em>(1992) 10 Cal.App.4th 612, 628 [12 Cal.Rptr.2d 741].) KMSL contends the trial court improperly \u201ctailor[ed] a new category of damages to fit Altavion.\u201d As explained below, the trial court properly based its damages award on the reasonable royalty measure of damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-6\">Altavion conceded during its opening statement that it could not prove it had actual damages, and the trial court found Altavion had not proven any actual loss. The court reasoned, \u201cThe evidence that [Altavion] would have a working software product embedded in [KMSL\u2019s] hardware machines, and successfully sold for years at a profit, under the circumstances, is highly speculative and uncertain, and the revenue projections are unreliable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b90-7\">Regarding unjust enrichment, the trial court noted that, although Altavion had not argued for that measure of damages, section 3426.3 required the court to consider whether such damages were provable. The court quoted <em>Ajaxo, supra, </em>187 Cal.App.4th at page 1313, which held \u201cthat where a defendant has not realized a profit or other calculable benefit as a result of his or her misappropriation of a trade secret, unjust enrichment is not provable within the meaning of section 3426.3, subdivision (b), whether the lack of benefit is determined as a matter of law or as a matter of fact.\u201d The trial court then suggested there was no such evidence of a calculable benefit in the present case, reasoning that KMSL \u201cdid not incorporate [Altavion\u2019s] trade secrets into any of its [MFP] products, or create a software that it sells or licenses, or otherwise commercially exploit the secrets. [KMSL has] made no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>profits from [Altavion\u2019s] trade secrets or its misappropriation.\u201d The court also pointed out that KMSL did not misappropriate Altavion\u2019s DST source code or algorithms, which were Altavion\u2019s \u201ccore\u201d trade secret.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-4\">The trial court then acknowledged the next step was to determine whether a reasonable royalties award was appropriate, quoting <em>Ajaxo, supra, </em>187 Cal.App.4th 1295, for the propositions that \u201cwhere the defendant does not make any profit, reasonable royalties could be awarded\u201d <em>(id. </em>at p. 1312) and \u201c[w]hen calculating a monetary remedy for the past use of a misappropriated trade secret, a court \u2018may order\u2019 reasonable royalties \u2018[i]f neither damages [for actual loss] nor unjust enrichment caused by misappropriation are provable\u2019 \u201d <em>(id. </em>at p. 1308). The court then quoted extensively from <em>Ajaxo </em>and other authorities regarding the standards for determining the amount of a reasonable royalty.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-5\">Ultimately, the court found, \u201cwhether properly characterized as unjust enrichment or (because. [KMSL] made no profit and the exact amount of the value or benefit to [KMSL] is not easily subject to calculation) as reasonable royalties, the [c]ourt would award the same amount of damages.\u201d The court proceeded to list a number of circumstances that it had considered, \u201cincluding but not limited to the fact that [KMSL has] not used the hade secrets in any product; [KMSL does] not presently have any viable software to produce a DST for Closed Loop or for self-authentication? [KMSL] attempted to obtain the trade secrets of [Altavion] without having to pay for them . . . and when this did not occur [KMSL] attempted to create its own DST technology by piggy-backing upon all of the DST knowledge and information [KMSL] had received from [Altavion]; that [KMSL] expended [its] own resources thereafter to try and develop the DST technology . . . but were unable to actually achieve Closed Loop results or achieve DST matching that of [Altavion]; that [Altavion] spent years developing its technology at its own expense; that the parties discussed development of an SDK or other means by which [Altavion] would further develop its DST technology to be used for Closed Loop, at a price range of $400,000 to $500,000, and then potentially entered into a commercial agreement to sell a product together with revenue sharing of some sort; that [KMSL\u2019s] expert opined that the R&amp;D costs incurred by [Altavion] for the DST were approximately $660,000, and would be approximately $1.2 million if it included the unpaid \u2018salary\u2019 of Moussa; that the unpaid \u2018salary\u2019 of Moussa was . . . not an amount negotiated at arm\u2019s length; that the Altavion records internally regarding financials and technology and externally regarding the communications and transactions between the parties are not reliable or are incomplete; that [Altavion] still retains its core trade secret(s); and that there is presently no market for [Altavion\u2019s] technology or for [KMSL\u2019s] patented DST ideas.\u201d The court awarded Altavion damages of $1 million, \u201cas the equitable value of the trade secrets misappropriated at the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>time of the misappropriation commencing in late June 2004.\u201d The court also awarded prejudgment interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-4\">KMSL argues the trial court \u201cventured into uncharted waters, selecting \u2018none of the above\u2019 as the measure of damages . . . and awarding Altavion $1 million \u2018as the equitable value of the trade secrets misappropriated. \u2019 \u201d KMSL mischaracterizes the court\u2019s decision. The court did not conclude none of the statutory measures of damages were applicable. Instead, the trial court expressly found the amount of Altavion\u2019s actual loss was unprovable, suggested the amount of KMSL\u2019s unjust enrichment was also unprovable, and found $1 million was a reasonable royalty. Although the court did not make an express finding about unjust enrichment, that measure of damages is unprovable \u201cwhere a defendant has not realized a profit or other calculable benefit as a result of his or her misappropriation of a trade secret.\u201d <em>(Ajaxo, </em>supra, 187 Cal.App.4th at p. 1313.) In the circumstances of the present case, the court\u2019s finding that KMSL did not make any profits from or otherwise commercialize Altavion\u2019s trade secrets is properly understood as a finding that the amount of unjust enrichment was unprovable.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-5\">Contrary to KMSL\u2019s argument on appeal, the trial court unequivocally concluded that $1 million was a reasonable royalty for the misappropriated trade secrets. The trial court\u2019s reference to the \u201cequitable value\u201d of the misappropriated secrets appears to be due to the origin of the reasonable royalty measure of damages in equitable principles. (See <em>Ajaxo, supra, </em>187 Cal.App.4th at p. 1310; <em>University Computing Co. v. Lykes-Youngstown Corp. </em>(5th Cir. 1974) 504 F.2d 518, 536-537.) <em>University Computing </em>quoted an earlier decision explaining, \u201c \u2018To adopt a reasonable royalty as the measure of damages is to adopt and interpret, as well as may be, the fiction that a license was to be granted at the time of beginning the infringement, and then to determine what the license price should have been. In effect, the court assumes the existence <em>ab initio </em>of, and declares the <em>equitable </em>terms of, a supposititious license, and does this <em>nunc pro </em>tunc; it creates and applies retrospectively a compulsory license. . . .\u2019 \u201d <em>(University Computing, </em>at p. 537, second italics added.) KMSL\u2019s assertion that the trial court \u201cinvented a theory outside the statute\u201d is meritless.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-6\">Furthermore, although KMSL asserts \u201cthere is no basis for a royalty award,\u201d KMSL does not actually provide any reasoned argument on that issue with citations to the record and supporting authority. <em>(Badie </em>v. <em>Bank of America, supra, </em>67 Cal.App.4th at pp. 784\u2014785.) That is, KMSL does not address the specific evidence cited by the trial court in justifying its damages award and explain why that evidence was insufficient to support the award under the reasonable royalties .measure of damages.

The underlying theory is that \u201c \u2018[a]n individual who must litigate to recover damages should be placed in the same position, when he recovers, as the individual who recovered the day he suffered an injury.

In <em>Greater Westchester, supra, </em>26 Cal.3d 86, the California Supreme Court held it was improper to award prejudgment interest for personal injuries and emotional distress sustained by reason of airport noise. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 102.) The court reasoned, \u201cdamages for the intangible, noneconomic aspects of mental and emotional injury are . . . inherently nonpecuniary, unliquidated and not readily subject to precise calculation. The amount of such damages is necessarily left to the subjective <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>discretion of the trier of fact. Retroactive interest on such damages adds uncertain conjecture to speculation. Moreover where, as here, the injury was of a continuing nature, it is particularly difficult to determine when any particular increment of intangible loss arose.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 103.)</p>\n<p id=\"b94-4\">The trial court\u2019s award of prejudgment interest was not an abuse of discretion under <em>Greater Westchester. </em>Although, as the trial court acknowledged, it was difficult to measure Altavion\u2019s damages or KMSL\u2019s unjust enrichment, the trial court was able to determine a reasonable royalty for the misappropriated trade secrets. That royalty represented the \u201c \u2018 \u201chypothetically agreed value of what [KMSL] wrongfully obtained from\u201d \u2019 \u201d Altavion, based on \u201c \u2018 \u201cwhat the parties would have agreed to as a fair licensing price at the time that the misappropriation occurred.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>(Ajaxo, supra, </em>187 Cal.App.4th at p. 1308.) Thus, the damages are for a pecuniary injury, the amount of the royalty is based on an objective assessment of the evidence rather than a subjective assessment of harm, and the award of prejudgment interest compensates Altavion for loss of the use of the royalty funds it should have received at the time of misappropriation.

Board of Trustees of California State University </em>(2005) 132 Cal.App.4th 359 [33 Cal.Rptr.3d 644], concluded the trial court had discretion to base, its fee award on the plaintiff attorney\u2019s higher home hourly rate in the \u201cunusual circumstance\u201d that local counsel was unavailable. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 399; cf. <em>Nichols v. City of Taft, supra, </em>155 Cal.App.4th at p. 1242 [trial court \u201cerred when it used a multiplier enhancement to compensate for out-of-town counsel\u2019s higher fee rate, because no threshold showing was made that it was impracticable for plaintiff to hire local counsel\u201d].) Although <em>Horsford </em>demonstrates there are circumstances where it is appropriate to base a fee award on nonlocal hourly rates, the case also supports the proposition that an award based on local rates is the <em>default </em>rule, from which the trial court may deviate in its discretion, where justified by the circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-5\">KMSL points to no such circumstances in the present case, beyond the bare fact that Altavion\u2019s counsel\u2019s home rates in Sacramento are lower. But that circumstance is insufficient in itself, because the rule that fee awards generally should be based on reasonable local hourly rates presupposes that an attorney\u2019s <em>actual </em>rates may be different for any number of reasons\u2014 because, for example, the attorney normally charges higher or lower rates, works on a contingency basis, or is in-house counsel.

For example, a spring 2004 \u201c[KMSL] Digital Stamping Technology Proposal\u201d repeatedly used the phrase \u201cdigital stamping technology\u201d (and often \u201cAltavion\u201d DST) and the abbreviation DST. Similarly, the phrase and/or abbreviation were used in two 2004 evaluations of Altavion\u2019s software and a July 2005 KMSL technology plan, among other KMSL documents. Moreover, counsel for KMSL used the phrase at trial. Further, the phrase appears repeatedly in Altavion\u2019s second amended and operative complaint.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b60-7\"> In an internal project proposal, KMSL described Altavion\u2019s DST as follows: \u201cAltavion has answered these technology challenges by developing the only known technology which provides document authentication checking via an embedded stamp and additionally adds tamper location discovery or integrity checking for an unauthentic document. The Altavion document authentication solution falls into the category of Digital Stamping and is applied to the pixelized rendering of a digital document, not the content in its raw data form. With Altavion\u2019s [DST], it is now possible to take a digital document and place a visible [two]Dimensional barcode or digital stamp of authenticity on the document. Encoded in this machine readable stamp are various types of information including authenticity data, integrity data, and administrative data. By placing a digital stamp on a digital document, the party administering the stamping process inherently claims that the documents are considered authentic at the time of stamping and thereafter. And through the use of DST the party administering the stamping process now has a mechanism via the digital stamp to verify that the document is authentic or not, and if unauthentic be able to locate where the document had been altered.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b61-7\"> Altavion\u2019s second amended and operative complaint named as defendants KMSL; sales, support, and service company Konica Minolta Business Solutions U.S.A., Inc.; parent company Konica Minolta Business Technologies, Inc.; Konica Minolta Technology Center, Inc.; Konica Minolta Holdings, Inc.; and former KMSL consultant Paul Cattrone. Defendants Konica Minolta Holdings, Inc., and Cattrone were voluntarily dismissed before trial, and the trial court found Altavion proved its misappropriation claim against only KMSL.

And KMSL does not dispute that use of Altavion\u2019s trade secrets to further its own development would constitute misappropriation. (See <em>PMC, Inc. v.

Nevertheless, the numbered trade secrets in the Outline otherwise correspond to the same numbered trade secrets in the Amended Identification, which includes a more detailed narrative regarding the alleged secrets than the Outline. EMSL does not attempt to demonstrate that any of the particular misappropriated trade secret concepts the trial court identified in the FSOD were not included in the Outline; neither does KMSL provide any citations to authority for its apparent suggestion that it is improper to refer to the Amended Identification to clarify the corresponding numbered trade secrets in the Outline. In light of the obvious correlation between the two documents, such a conclusion would be senseless in the present case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b76-10\"> Although KMSL asserts broadly that insufficient evidence supports the court\u2019s misappropriation findings, KMSL only provides reasoned argument that Altavion\u2019s DST design concepts are not protectable as trade secrets as a matter of law, and that Altavion\u2019s DST concept had been disclosed to others (see pt.
