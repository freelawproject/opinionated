Serri had worked as the University\u2019s director of affirmative action since 1992. The University terminated her employment in 2007 because she failed to produce affirmative action plans for three consecutive years, even though her job required that she produce an affirmative action plan annually. The University also terminated her employment because she made misrepresentations about the plans that she had failed to prepare.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-11\">Notwithstanding Serri\u2019s failure to produce the required plans\u2014and the misrepresentations she made about the nonexistant plans\u2014Serri filed a complaint alleging that she was wrongfully discharged from her employment based on her race and ethnic origin. Her complaint also contained causes of action for breach of her employment contract, retaliation and harassment in violation of the California Fair Employment and Housing Act (Gov. Code, \u00a7 12900 et seq.), violation of the federal Equal Pay Act of 1963 (Pub.L. No. 88-38 (June 10, 1963) 77 Stat. 56), defamation, intentional and negligent infliction of emotional distress, and interference with prospective economiq advantage. Defendants moved for summary judgment, or in the alternative, summary adjudication of each of Serri\u2019s causes of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"838\">*838</page-number>We are asked to determine whether an employee who is terminated for failing to perform an important job function can avoid summary judgment by arguing, based on expert evidence obtained for the purpose of opposing a motion for summary judgment or summary adjudication, years after the employee\u2019s termination, that the failure to perform did not and would not result in any adverse consequences to the employer. We hold that after-acquired expert evidence that there were no adverse consequences from an employee\u2019s failure to perform does not create a triable issue of fact on the question whether the employee failed to perform his or her job duties and thus has limited relevance, if any, to the question of discrimination.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-4\">In this case, expert evidence that the failure of performance did not harm the University, acquired years after Serri was terminated, did not create a triable issue of material fact on the question whether the University\u2019s stated reasons for terminating Serri were untrue or pretextual such that a reasonable trier of fact could conclude that the employer engaged in discrimination. Before she was terminated, Serri told the University her failure to prepare an affirmative action plan could have adverse consequences, including the loss of federal grants. That the University ultimately suffered no adverse consequences did not create a triable issue on the questions whether the University had a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason to terminate her employment or whether its reasons for doing so were untrue or pretextual. We also reject Serri\u2019s other contentions. Accordingly, we will affirm the summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-5\">Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b712-6\">For almost 15 years, from the latter half of 1992 until March 2007, Serri was employed by the University as its director of affirmative action. Her duties included handling and either mediating or investigating complaints filed by faculty, students, and staff under the University\u2019s anti-discrimination and anti-harassment policy, which the University refers to as \u201cPolicy 311.\u201d Serri\u2019s duties also included preparing the University\u2019s annual \u201cAffirmative Action Plan\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and providing sexual harassment training to the University staff. Serri testified in deposition that since the University was a federal contractor, federal regulations required the University to prepare an annual AAP. In a memo she wrote in November 2005, Serri described the AAP as \u201cpivotal and essential for us for obtaining and retaining federal grants.\u201d Serri, who is Puerto Rican, was 54 years old when the University terminated her employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"839\">*839</page-number>At all times relevant to this case, defendant Father Paul Locatelli<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> was the president of the University, defendant Robert Warren was the University\u2019s vice-president of administration and finance, and defendant Molly McDonald was the University\u2019s assistant vice-president of human resources. McDonald reported to Warren, and Warren reported directly to Father Locatelli. Until April 2006, Seni also reported directly to Father Locatelli. McDonald supervised Serri from April 2006 until Serri\u2019s termination in March 2007.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-5\">Defendants John Ottoboni and Julie Veit are attorneys. Veit is Ottoboni\u2019s daughter. Before 2007, they both worked for a law firm that served as outside counsel to the University. In the fall of 2006, the University hired Ottoboni as its in-house general counsel, effective January 1, 2007. In late January 2007, Veit started working for the University as an in-house legal associate to the human resources department. Veit reported to McDonald, not Ottoboni.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-6\">\n<em>The University\u2019s Affirmative Action Plan</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b713-7\">Serri testified in deposition that there were three major components to the University\u2019s Affirmative Action Plan. The first component had two parts: (1) a narrative report that Serri prepared, and (2) several statistical analyses that her assistant Linda Jocewicz prepared based on data provided by the human resources department. The AAP narrative contained the University\u2019s \u201ccritical self analysis\u201d and discussed specific topics as required by the Code of Federal Regulations. The statistical analyses part included a workforce analysis, a job group analysis, and an availability analysis (\u201can estimate of the number of qualified minorities and women available for employment\u201d in specific job groups). The other two components of the AAP were the \u201capplicant flow\u201d and the \u201cglass ceiling part,\u201d which Serri testified she never prepared because she was never given the data she needed to complete those components.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-8\">\n<em>Events in 2003 and 2004</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b713-9\">McDonald started working for the University in May 2003. Shortly thereafter, Serri told McDonald that she had had difficulty obtaining the data she needed to complete the statistical portion of the AAP\u2019s from McDonald\u2019s predecessor. McDonald promised her full cooperation and encouraged Serri to contact her if she encountered any problems with the human resources department.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-10\">Serri reported directly to Father Locatelli for many years. In about 2003, Father Locatelli began considering changing their reporting relationship and having Serri report to McDonald instead. Serri objected and wrote him a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"840\">*840</page-number>letter in December 2003, in which she explained why she did not believe it would be a good idea to make the affirmative action office part of human resources. In June 2004, Father Locatelli questioned Serri\u2019s role in investigating faculty complaints. After consulting with Ottoboni and Veit (who were then outside counsel), Father Locatelli advised Serri that the University needed to make changes in policies, procedures, and reporting relationships related to the affirmative action office, but no such management changes were made in 2004 or 2005.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b714-4\">\n<em>Serri\u2019s Wage Complaint</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b714-5\">On November 7, 2005, Serri sent Father Locatelli a letter in which she complained about an \u201cunjustifiable salary disparity\u201d between her salary and that of Charles Ambelang, a male employee in the human resources department whose job functions Serri alleged were comparable to her own. Serri said she had informed McDonald of the salary disparity in March 2005. Her letter asked Father Locatelli to \u201cremedy this inequity . . . without further delay.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b714-6\">\n<em>April 6, 2006 Meeting Between Serri, Father Locatelli, McDonald, and Veit</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b714-7\">In 2006, Father Locatelli ultimately determined that he did not have sufficient time to manage Serri\u2019s department and decided that Serri would report directly to McDonald, but would provide him with monthly updates regarding her activities, thus creating what the parties referred to as a \u201cdotted-line\u201d reporting relationship between Serri and Father Locatelli.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-8\">Father Locatelli met with McDonald and Serri on April 6, 2006, to discuss the reporting changes and other issues. At that meeting, Father Locatelli reassured Serri that the change in their reporting relationship was not a demotion. He noted that other reporting changes were also taking place.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-9\">Shortly after the April 6, 2006 meeting, Serri took a medical leave of absence from the University to have surgery. Serri returned from her medical leave on June 20, 2006. Shortly thereafter, the University offered to make an equity adjustment to her salary, increasing it from $104,000 to $118,350 per year retroactive to March 1, 2005, the date Serri first informed McDonald of the alleged salary disparity. The University also offered Serri a 3.5 percent merit increase for the 2006-2007 academic year, which brought her salary up to $122,492 per year effective July 1, 2006. At that time, the University was in the process of having an outside consultant, Mercer Human Resources <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"841\">*841</page-number>Consulting (Mercer), review the salaries of certain University employees, including Serri\u2019s salary. As part of that process, McDonald asked Serri to prepare a written description of her job for Mercer, which Sem completed on June 21, 2006. The University told Serri that if Mercer determined that an additional salary increase was warranted, that increase would be made retroactive as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-5\">\n<em>Serri\u2019s June 2006 Discrimination Claim</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b715-6\">On June 21, 2006, the same day the University offered to make an equity adjustment to Serri\u2019s salary, Serri made a formal written complaint against Father Locatelli and Warren under Policy 311. Serri\u2019s complaint against Father Locatelli alleged gender discrimination because she made $20,000 per year less than Ambelang;<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> she also claimed the wage disparity was a violation of the federal Equal Pay Act of 1963. Serri\u2019s complaint against Warren alleged that she felt threatened by him when he interfered with her investigation of a sexual harassment claim involving two employees of the facilities department in 2005.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-7\">Since it would have been inappropriate for Serri to investigate her own claims, the University hired an independent investigator for these claims. University representatives asked Ottoboni, who was then outside counsel for the University, for a recommendation. Ottoboni recommended Steven Manchester, an attorney with over 35 years of experience. The University then hired Manchester to investigate Serri\u2019s claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-8\">On July 30, 2006, Manchester issued a written report in which he found that Serri\u2019s claims were without merit and that neither Father Locatelli nor Warren had violated Policy 311. Serri appealed Manchester\u2019s findings to the University\u2019s board of trustees (Board). The Board held a hearing on September 12, 2006. Serri, who was represented by counsel, presented documents and argument in support of her appeal. The Board affirmed Manchester\u2019s findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-9\">\n<em>Serri\u2019s Working Relationship with Veit</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b715-10\">As assistant vice-president for human resources, McDonald regularly worked with outside counsel, including Veit. From time to time Veit, who practiced employment law, gave the University legal advice on matters that Serri handled, including the investigation of complaints and sexual harassment training. Veit often attended McDonald\u2019s meetings with Serri. On <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"842\">*842</page-number>September 26, 2006, McDonald sent Serri an e-mail suggesting that Veit attend their \u201cregularly scheduled\u201d biweekly meetings, to which Serri responded, \u201cBrilliant idea, Molly! Let\u2019s do it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b716-4\">\n<em>Serri Discloses Her Failure to Prepare Affirmative Action Plans</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b716-5\">Father Locatelli asked to meet with McDonald and Serri in mid-October to discuss Serri\u2019s cases. To prepare for the meeting, Father Locatelli asked Serri to provide him with a written report by October 10, 2006, regarding the status of the cases she had handled between April and September 2006. The meeting was ultimately scheduled for October 13, 2006.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-6\">About a week before the meeting, on October 5, 2006, Serri filed discrimination claims against the University with the California Department of Fair Employment and Housing (DFEH) and the federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC). The claims alleged (1) discrimination on the basis of sex, race, and national origin and (2) retaliation for complaining about discrimination and a violation of the Equal Pay Act of 1963.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-7\">On October 10, 2006, at one of her regular meetings with McDonald and Veit, Serri told McDonald that the University \u201chad not had a defensible Affirmative Action Plan\u201d for several years. Serri was upset that her assistant, Linda Jocewicz, had not been trained on certain computer software so she could access human resources data she needed to prepare the statistical analyses part of the AAP. Serri stated that during the entire time that she was the director of affirmative action, she never received the data she needed to complete the AAP\u2019s. This was the first McDonald had heard of this and she immediately became concerned. McDonald agreed to provide Serri with whatever data she needed and Serri agreed to provide Veit with a copy of the most recent AAP. After Serri\u2019s disclosure, Warren became concerned that the University could lose certain government funding because it did not have a defensible AAP.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-8\">Serri and Father Locatelli exchanged a series of e-mails in preparation for their October 13, 2006 meeting.- On October 12, 2006, Father Locatelli told Serri their meeting would include a review of her cases as of September 30, as well as the \u201ccurrent Affirmative Action [P]lan.\u201d He asked her to \u201cbring the current Affirmative Action [P]lan and all plans for the last 10 years\u201d to the meeting.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-9\">Serri responded via e-mail, stating in part, \u201cIn the spirit of open communication I must say that I find the tone of your emails hostile.\u201d She also stated, \u201cTo this date, I have never received the completed data we need to complete the Affirmative Action Plan, even though we have asked for it in the past <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"843\">*843</page-number>numerous times. I am working on the current plan for this year. I will bring a draft and last year\u2019s. The industry standard is to destroy the AAP[\u2019]s that are over two years old.\u201d Father Locatelli responded, \u201cPlease let me clarify so there is no misunderstanding. I am only trying to get the material that you promised to send me as well as information that I thought was readily available to you. My purpose is to be as prepared as possible in order to have a fruitful and effective meeting. [][] It is unclear how my email could be read as \u2018hostile\u2019 and I am looking forward to a productive meeting tomorrow.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b717-5\">At the meeting on October 13, 2006, Serri produced two documents that were labeled \u201cDRAFT . . . Affirmative Action Plan\u201d covering the periods \u201cFebruary 2006 through January, [sic] 2007\u201d and \u201cNovember 1, 2006 through October 31, 2007.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The draft AAP\u2019s that Serri produced in October 2006 were 25-page narrative reports that documented the University\u2019s \u201cpolicy of sustaining equal employment opportunity and implementing affirmative action efforts in conformity with\u201d federal statutes and executive orders. Both documents contained multiple typographical and grammatical errors, incomplete sentences, and other errors. The University later learned that Serri created both draft AAP\u2019s the day before the October 13, 2006 meeting. In deposition, Serri admitted that she prepared the two draft AAP\u2019s the day before the meeting and that she did not inform either Father Locatelli or McDonald that she had done so.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-6\">At the October 13, 2006 meeting, Serri said (1) she was not an expert in AAP\u2019s; (2) she needed to hire a consultant to help prepare the AAP\u2019s because the applicable regulations had changed; and (3) her assistant had failed to obtain the data she needed to prepare the statistical analyses part of the AAP from human resources. Serri repeated her previous statement that the University had no current, defensible AAP; she also said the University was likely to be audited by the federal government and recommended the University hire Anna Maly, an AAP consultant, at a cost of $9,000, to revamp its AAP and to create a template for future AAP\u2019s. Prior to this meeting, Serri had never told McDonald she did not feel competent to prepare the AAP or that she needed a consultant to help her prepare it.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"844\">*844</page-number>In deposition, Serri testified that she started preparing AAP\u2019s in 1992 and that she prepared an AAP each year between 1992 and 2000.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Serri also testified that the last time she prepared the narrative portion of the AAP prior to October 2006 was in 2002 and that Jocewicz had prepared the statistical analyses for the AAP in 2005 and 2006, but not in 2004.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-4\">Father Locatelli, Warren, McDonald, Ottoboni, and Veit met on October 18, 2006, to discuss the problems related to the University\u2019s AAP. They decided that McDonald would take over the responsibility of completing the 2006 AAP. On October 19, 2006, McDonald sent Serri an e-mail informing her that she (McDonald) would be \u201cfacilitate[ing] the coordination of this year\u2019s Affirmative Action Plan\u201d in light of Serri\u2019s statements that (1) the AAP was \u201cincomplete and indefensible,\u201d (2) she was unable to \u201cproduce a defensible plan without hiring a consultant,\u201d and (3) it was likely the University would be audited. The reassignment of duties was also based on McDonald\u2019s review of the draft Plans Serri had prepared and the fact that the University had not had an AAP since 2003. McDonald asked Serri to provide the exhibits and the statistical analyses that were referenced in the draft AAP\u2019s. She also informed Serri that she was asking University counsel to review the AAP.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-5\">Serri objected to the reassignment of her duties relating to the 2006 AAP in an e-mail dated October 20, 2006, stating that the preparation of the AAP was \u201cone of those roles that define [her] position\u201d and that she felt \u201ccompelled to protest this act to the EEOC as an act of retaliation.\u201d She stated that (1) regulations governing AAP\u2019s had changed; (2) since 2004, she had needed to hire a consultant to prepare an AAP that was defensible and complete in light of the new regulations; (3) Father Locatelli never gave her permission to hire a consultant; and (4) McDonald\u2019s predecessor had denied her \u201cessential data\u201d and computer training needed to complete past AAP\u2019s. Serri also blamed the problem with the AAP\u2019s on Father Locatelli\u2019s \u201cunwillingness to communicate\u201d with and supervise her for six years.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-6\">\n<em>Serri\u2019s October 2006 Claims</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b718-7\">On October 20, 2006, Serri lodged a second complaint under Policy 311, in which she claimed that McDonald\u2019s assumption of responsibility for the AAP was an act of retaliation for Serri\u2019s prior Policy 311 and EEOC claims. On or about October 24, 2006, Serri filed a second claim against the University with the DFEH, which was forwarded to the EEOC, in which she claimed that taking away her \u201cessential job function\u201d of preparing the AAP was \u201ca demotion\u201d that was retaliatory in nature.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"845\">*845</page-number>The University once again asked Ottoboni to recommend someone to investigate Serri\u2019s second Policy 311 claim. Since Manchester had found against Serri on her first claim and Serri had criticized his investigation, Ottoboni recommended the University retain Mark Fredkin, an attorney with over 25 years\u2019 experience, to investigate Serri\u2019s second claim. The University hired Fredkin. Linda MacLeod, an attorney at Fredkin\u2019s firm, assisted with the investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-5\">On October 23, 2006, Serri told McDonald that she no longer wanted Veit attending their meetings. But McDonald decided that Veit would continue to attend their meetings so they could discuss Serri\u2019s cases and projects with Veit present. She also believed \u201cit was important to have another person present for the conversations with Ms. Serri in light of past disagreements about what had transpired in earlier discussions.\u201d Veit attended only two or three more of Serri\u2019s meetings with McDonald, all in the fall of 2006. On November 13, 2006, Serri added an allegation to her second Policy 311 claim that Veit\u2019s presence at her meetings with McDonald was an act of retaliation against her.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-6\">\n<em>Ottoboni and Veit Obtain Employment With the University</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b719-7\">In 2006, the University decided to hire a full-time in-house general counsel and offered Ottoboni the job. The University announced Ottoboni\u2019s appointment as general counsel in the fall of 2006 and he started working directly for the University on January 1, 2007.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-8\">In the latter part of 2006, McDonald recommended the University hire an in-house attorney for the human resources department who would report directly to McDonald. Warren approved and the University advertised the position in December 2006. Veit applied and was offered the job; she started working directly for the University in late January 2007. Serri\u2019s duties did not change after Veit was hired. Seiri\u2019s job and Veit\u2019s job were and remained separate and distinct.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-9\">\n<em>Results of Second Investigation</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b719-10\">On January 17, 2007, Fredkin and MacLeod issued a report in which they concluded that Serri had failed to meet her burden of proof on her retaliation claims. Serri appealed the decision to the Board and on February 13, 2007, the Board affirmed the investigators\u2019 findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-11\">\n<em>The University Terminated Serri\u2019s Employment</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b719-12\">In October 2006, Warren recognized the seriousness of Serri\u2019s failure to complete the AAP\u2019s. He believed preparation of the AAP\u2019s was a \u201ccritical <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"846\">*846</page-number>aspect\u201d of Serri\u2019s job and was concerned that the University could lose certain government funding because it did not have an AAP in place. Notwithstanding his immediate concerns, Warren decided not to make any decisions regarding Serri\u2019s employment until after the Policy 311 investigation and appeal were completed.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-4\">After the appeal of Serri\u2019s second claim was completed, Warren decided to terminate Serri. He made the decision himself instead of deferring to McDonald because he believed \u201cSerri\u2019s misconduct to be sufficiently grave as to require [his] personal intervention.\u201d On March 7, 2007, Warren hand delivered a letter to Serri, advising her that she was being terminated for three reasons: (1) her \u201cfailure to prepare, develop and implement the University Affirmative Action Plan for years 2003-2004, 2004-2005, and 2005-2006\u201d; (2) her \u201cfailure to disclose to [her] supervisors the nonexistence of the University Affirmative Action Plans\u201d for those years; and (3) her \u201cmisrepresentations related to the Affirmative Action Plans.\u201d Warren considered these acts to be \u201cgross misconduct sufficient to warrant [Serri\u2019s] immediate termination\u201d without corrective action. When he delivered the letter, Warren was accompanied by Ingrid Williams, an employee of the human resources department, who helped Serri gather her personal belongings.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-5\">After the University terminated Serri, it hired Deborah Hirsch, a woman from outside the University who was the same age as Serri, as the director of affirmative action. Hirsch started working for the University in October 2007.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-6\">\n<em>Declaration of Linda Campbell</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b720-7\">In declarations, Linda Campbell, who had been the University\u2019s director of sponsored projects for 12 years, stated that virtually all grant and contract applications the University submits to federal, local and state governments require the University to certify certain things, including that the University has completed its annual AAP. Prior to 2002, Serri personally signed the AAP certifications. But after Serri\u2019s office was moved to another building in 2002, Campbell and Serri agreed that Campbell would sign the certifications. Campbell assumed Serri would notify her promptly if there was any reason she could not sign the certification forms. Campbell talked to Serri about the certifications two or three times a year; they communicated about them via e-mail and Campbell occasionally provided Serri with copies of documents the University was being asked to sign. From 2003 until 2006, the University certified on multiple occasions that it was in compliance with regulations requiring AAP\u2019s. As examples, Campbell attached copies of two grant applications the University submitted to two different federal agencies in December 2005 and March 2006, in which the University certified that it had developed an AAP as required by the rules and regulations of the United <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"847\">*847</page-number>States Secretary of Labor. Both applications were signed by Don Dodson, the University\u2019s vice-provost for academic affairs. One application requested grant funding in excess of $15 million. Campbell declared that during the relevant timeframe, Serri never told her the University did not have an AAP.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-5\">On September 21, 2006, Campbell sent Seni an e-mail in which she wrote that the City of San Jos\u00e9 wanted a copy of the University\u2019s AAP \u201cas part of our award paperwork for this year.\u201d Campbell asked Serri whether the University released its AAP. Serri responded that the University could not release its AAP because \u201cit has proprietary, sensitive information that can compromise the University in case we get sued by job applicants. . . . We have never released it.\u201d Serri did not tell Campbell the University did not have an AAP and had not had one for three years. Serri offered to send Campbell \u201ca summarized, sanitized version\u201d of the AAP, but stated that \u201cit is still not a good idea.\u201d In deposition, Serri testified that the \u201csanitized version\u201d she mentioned in her e-mail was the narrative summary, like the draft AAP\u2019s she prepared in October 2006. Serri also testified that she knew people in the grants office were certifying that the University had an APP when in fact no AAP had existed for three years.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-6\">Procedural History</p>\n<p id=\"b721-7\">Seni filed her original complaint on June 20, 2007. The operative pleading is Serri\u2019s fourth amended complaint, which was filed in July 2008, after the trial court sustained defendants\u2019 demurrers to previous complaints with leave to amend.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-8\">The fourth amended complaint (hereafter sometimes \u201ccomplaint\u201d) alleges causes of action against the University for employment discrimination, tortious discharge, violation of the California Equal Pay Act (Lab. Code, \u00a7 1197.5), breach of an implied contract of continued employment, bad faith, and retaliation in violation of the Fair Employment and Housing Act (FEHA; Gov. Code, \u00a7 12940, subd. (h)). The complaint asserts causes of action against the University, Father Locatelli, McDonald, and Warren for defamation, intentional infliction of emotional distress, and negligent infliction of emotional distress. The complaint includes a cause of action for harassment (Gov. Code, \u00a7 12940, subd. (j)) against the University, Father Locatelli, McDonald, and Veit. Finally, the complaint alleges a cause of action against Ottoboni and Veit for interference with prospective economic advantage.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-9\">The defendants were divided into two groups represented by two separate lawyers: (1) the University and Father Locatelli were represented by Attorney Allen Ruby and (2) Warren, McDonald, Ottoboni, and Veit were represented by Attorney Sonya Winner. We shall hereafter refer to Warren, McDonald, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"848\">*848</page-number>\u00d3ttoboni, and Veit collectively as the \u201cIndividual Defendants\u201d and to all defendants collectively as \u201cDefendants.\u201d Defendants answered the fourth amended complaint in August 2008.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-4\">On April 12, 2011, the court set the case for trial on September 6, 2011. On May 17, 2011, Warren, McDonald, Ottoboni, and Veit each filed and served a motion for summary judgment or, in the alternative, summary adjudication. The following day (May 18, 2011), the University and Father Locatelli filed and served their joint motion for summary judgment or summary adjudication in the alternative. All five motions were scheduled for hearing on August 2, 2011.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-5\">On July 8, 2011, Serri made an ex parte application to continue both the hearing on the motions for summary judgment and the trial date for four weeks so she could complete additional discovery she needed to oppose the motions. After giving the Defendants an opportunity to file written opposition and holding a hearing on Serri\u2019s application, the court granted Serri\u2019s requests in part. The court continued the hearing on the motions for summary judgment from August 2, 2011, to August 25, 2011; extended the deadline for Serri to file opposition to the motions from July 19, 2011, to August 11, 2011; but denied Serri\u2019s request to continue the trial date.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-6\">On August 11, 2011, Serri filed her opposition to the motions for summary judgment, which consisted of a single memorandum of points and authorities, five separate statements (one in response to each of Defendants\u2019 five separate statements), the declarations of her counsel and of John Fox (an expert on AAP\u2019s), and 408 exhibits. Although Serri\u2019s evidence included excerpts from her deposition, she did not file a declaration in support of her opposition. Regarding the employment discrimination claims, Serri asserted that the stated reasons for her termination were false and that there was evidence of discriminatory animus.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-7\">On page 1 of her memorandum of points and authorities in opposition to the motions, Serri requested a further continuance of the summary judgment motions \u201cto obtain the essential remaining discovery she needs to oppose [the] motions.\u201d Serri stated that she needed to depose Linda Campbell and a person most knowledgeable from the University, asserted that the University had refused to produce those witnesses, and argued that she could not \u201cadequately oppose the motions without that discovery.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b722-8\">On August 19, 2011, Defendants filed papers in reply to Serri\u2019s opposition to the motions for summary judgment, including memoranda-of points and authorities, separate statements in reply to Serri\u2019s opposition, and \"objections to Serri\u2019s evidence. Defendants also opposed Serri\u2019s request for a second <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"849\">*849</page-number>continuance, arguing that Serri had failed to comply with the procedural requirements of Code of Civil Procedure section 437c, subdivision (h),<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> since she had not submitted any affidavits or declarations supporting her continuance request and had not submitted any evidence that the Defendants had refused to produce any witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-5\">On August 23, 2011, two days before the hearing, Serri\u2019s counsel submitted additional points and authorities and a declaration supporting his second request for a continuance.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-6\">On August 24, 2011, the day before the hearing on the motions for summary judgment, Serri filed written responses to the Defendants\u2019 objections to her evidence. Later that day, the court issued a written tentative ruling sustaining Defendants\u2019 objections to Serri\u2019s evidence and granting each of the motions for summary judgment. Serri objected to the tentative ruling and requested oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-7\">On August 25, 2011, at the hearing on the motions for summary judgment, Serri filed an additional 37 pages of written objections to Defendants\u2019 evidence. She also filed a written statement of disqualification objecting to having Judge Mark Pierce hear the motions for summary judgment pursuant to section 170.3, on the grounds that he had failed to disclose that (1) he was a graduate of the University, and (2) he had made financial contributions to the University. After conducting a hearing on Serri\u2019s disqualification request, the court denied it as untimely and then heard argument on the motions for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-8\">On August 30, 2011, the court issued its order on the motions for summary judgment. The court denied Serri\u2019s second request for a continuance to do additional discovery, overruled Serri\u2019s objections to Defendants\u2019 evidence, sustained Defendants\u2019 objections to Serri\u2019s evidence, and granted each of the motions for summary judgment. Although it sustained Defendants\u2019 objections to Serri\u2019s evidence, the court stated: \u201cRegardless, after a comprehensive review of all of the evidence submitted by Plaintiff, the Court finds that even if it found Plaintiff\u2019s evidence to be admissible, it would not impact and/or change any of the rulings\u201d on the motions for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-9\">On August 30, 2011, the court entered judgment in favor of Defendants, determined that Defendants were prevailing parties, and awarded Defendants their costs of suit. On September 2, 2011, the court issued a written order striking Serri\u2019s statement of disqualification.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-10\">On September 12, 2011, Serri filed a petition for writ of mandate in this court, in which she requested an order directing the trial court to vacate its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"850\">*850</page-number>order striking her statement of disqualification. That same day, Serri also filed a notice of motion for new trial. Defendants opposed the writ petition and the motion for new trial. Defendants also filed a memorandum of costs, which Serri challenged with a motion to tax. In November 2011, the trial court denied Serri\u2019s motion to tax, awarded Defendants $50,723.41 in pretrial costs, and denied Seni\u2019s new trial motion. Later, this court denied Serri\u2019s petition for writ of mandate.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-4\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b724-5\">Serri challenges the order granting summary judgment on procedural grounds and on the merits. Procedurally, she argues that the court erred when it (1) denied her section 170.3 motion to disqualify Judge Pierce; (2) denied her second motion for a continuance of the hearing on the summary judgment motions; and (3) sustained Defendants\u2019 objections to her evidence. On the merits, Serri challenges the summary adjudication of each of her causes of action and, thus, the orders granting summary judgment. We begin by addressing Serri\u2019s procedural challenges.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-6\">I., II.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b724-7\">IH. <em>Defendants\u2019 Objections to Serri\u2019s Evidence</em></p>\n<p id=\"b724-8\">Serri contends the trial court abused its discretion when it sustained all of Defendants\u2019 objections to the evidence she submitted in opposition to the motions for summary judgment. Acknowledging the court\u2019s statements that it conducted \u201ca comprehensive review\u201d of all of her evidence, and even if it had found her \u201cevidence to be admissible, it would not impact and/or change any of the rulings,\u201d Serri argues that the court committed reversible error when it sustained Defendants\u2019 objections to her evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-9\">A. <em>Background</em></p>\n<p id=\"b724-10\">Serri\u2019s evidence in opposition to the motions for summary judgment consisted of the declarations of her counsel, Samuel Komhauser, and an expert witness, John Fox. Komhauser attached 408 exhibits to his declaration, which consume 1,374 pages of the record on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-11\">Both the University and the Individual Defendants filed written objections to Serri\u2019s evidence. The University\u2019s objections were 22 pages long; it made <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"851\">*851</page-number>124 objections to 116 of Serri\u2019s exhibits and 48 objections to statements in Fox\u2019s declaration. The Individual Defendants\u2019 objections were 40 pages long; they made 214 objections to almost every one of Serri\u2019s exhibits. They also objected to Fox\u2019s declaration.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-5\">Serri filed a 47-page response to the University\u2019s objections. The record contains a similar 63-page document that appears to be a template for responding to the Individual Defendants\u2019 objections, but the column entitled \u201cReasons Why Defendants\u2019 Objections are Without Merit\u201d in that document is blank.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b725-6\">One of Defendants\u2019 objections was that Serri\u2019s evidence included \u201cnearly 200 exhibit tabs for which no exhibits were submitted.\u201d In other words, although there were tabs for 408 exhibits, almost half of those tabs did not contain any evidence. The Individual Defendants identified those exhibits by number and also objected to a subset of those exhibits that Serri cited to in her opposition papers. For example, Serri cited exhibits 21, 271, 272, 352, and 378 in her points and authorities, even though no evidence was submitted under those exhibit tabs. At the hearing, Serri\u2019s counsel explained that the 408 exhibits were from his trial book and that he told his secretary to take out the exhibits that he was not using to oppose the summary judgment motion, but his secretary forgot to remove the exhibit tabs.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-7\">The University objected to a number of Serri\u2019s exhibits on the grounds of relevance, arguing that while they were in the 1,374 pages of material Serri submitted, they were not cited anywhere in Serri\u2019s opposition papers. Defendants objected that many of the exhibits lacked foundation because they were not properly authenticated, that many were inadmissible hearsay, and others were irrelevant because they did not support the proposition for which they were cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-8\">In accordance with California Rules of Court, rale 3.1354(c), Defendants filed 71 pages of proposed orders on their objections. Rather than use the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"852\">*852</page-number>proposed orders, the court ruled on the objections in its order granting summary judgment. The court sustained all of Defendants\u2019 objections, stating: \u201cAlthough Plaintiff\u2019s evidence contains over 400 exhibit tabs, nearly 200 exhibit tabs fail to contain any exhibits and many of the other exhibits lack foundation, are inadmissible hearsay, and/or are irrelevant as they are not cited in Plaintiff\u2019s opposition. With regard to the declaration of John Fox, Esq., many of the statements contained therein are not factually supported and constitute improper expert and/or legal opinion. Regardless, after a comprehensive review of all the evidence submitted by Plaintiff, the Court finds that even if it found Plaintiff\u2019s evidence to be admissible, it would not impact and/or change any of the rulings discussed below.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b726-4\">B. <em>Standard of Review</em></p>\n<p id=\"b726-5\">According to the weight of authority, appellate courts \u201creview the trial court\u2019s evidentiary rulings on summary judgment for abuse of discretion. [Citations.] As the part[y] challenging the court\u2019s decision, it is [Serri\u2019s] burden to establish such an abuse, which we will find only if the trial court\u2019s order exceeds the bounds of reason.\u201d <em>(DiCola </em>v. <em>White Brothers Performance Products, Inc. </em>(2008) 158 Cal.App.4th 666, 679 [69 Cal.Rptr.3d 888] <em>(DiCola); </em>but see <em>Reid, supra, </em>50 Cal.4th 512, 535 [Supreme Court noted issue but concluded that it need \u201cnot decide generally whether a trial court\u2019s ruling on evidentiary objections based on papers alone in summary judgment proceedings are reviewed for abuse of discretion or reviewed de novo\u201d] and <em>Nazir v.

(See <em>Reid . . . , supra, </em>50 Cal.4th 512, 534; ... \u00a7 437c, subds. (b)(5), (c), (d).)

The defendants moved for summary judgment; their reply papers included 764 objections to the plaintiff\u2019s evidence, set forth in 324 pages. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 249, 254.) The trial court overruled one and sustained 763 of the objections. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 255.) On appeal, the plaintiff acknowledged that some of the objections could have been properly sustained, but argued that the order sustaining all but one of the objections was error. The appellate court agreed and held that the trial court abused its discretion by making a blanket ruling sustaining all but one of the defendants\u2019 objections. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 254.)</p>\n<p id=\"b727-5\">The court stated that \u201c \u2018a trial court presented with timely evidentiary objections in proper form must expressly rule on the individual objections . . . .\u2019 <em>\u201d</em><footnotemark><em>12</em></footnotemark><em> (Nazir, supra, </em>178 Cal.App.4th at p. 255.) Although the trial court had \u201c \u2018ruled,\u2019 however conclusorily, that all objections save one were sustained,\u201d the appellate court held that the trial court\u2019s blanket ruling was \u201chardly a ruling, as it could not provide any meaningful basis for review.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 255.) The court assumed, without deciding, that the abuse of discretion standard applied, and stated, \u201c[W]e have no hesitancy in holding that the sustaining of all but one of defendants\u2019 764 objections was an abuse of discretion. Put otherwise, there is no way that the trial court could properly have sustained 763 objections \u2018 \u201c \u2018guided and controlled ... by fixed legal principles.\u2019 \u201d \u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b727-6\">The <em>Nazir </em>court also reviewed the objections and concluded that most were either unsupported by any rule or were patently frivolous. <em>(Nazir, supra, </em>178 Cal.App.4th at pp. 255-257.) The court observed that (1) some of <em>the </em>\u201cobjections did not even assert any basis for the objection\u201d; (2) some of the \u201cobjections were to [the] plaintiff\u2019s testimony about his dates of employment, his religion, his skin color, and his national origin\u201d; (3) \u201c[o]ver 250 of the sustained objections failed to quote the evidence objected to, in violation of California Rules of Court, rule 3.1354\u201d; (4) 27 of the objections \u201cwere to [the] plaintiff\u2019s brief, not his evidence\u201d; and (5) \u201cmany of the objections were frivolous.\u201d The court held that all of the plaintiff\u2019s admissible evidence was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"854\">*854</page-number>properly before it and that the admissible evidence created triable issues of fact precluding summary judgment. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 256, 257, 264; accord, <em>Twenty-Nine Palms Enterprises Corp. </em>v. <em>Bardos </em>(2012) 210 Cal.App.4th 1435, 1447-1449 [149 Cal.Rptr.3d 52] <em>(Palms) </em>[blanket ruling summarily sustaining all of the plaintiff\u2019s 39 objections to the defendant\u2019s evidence, without reasoning, was an abuse of discretion].)</p>\n<p id=\"b728-4\">Serri\u2019s brief provides little help in addressing the propriety of the trial court\u2019s ruling on Defendants\u2019 objections to Serri\u2019s evidence. Unlike <em>Nazir, </em>Serri does not provide any examples of specific objections that the trial court sustained that were erroneous or unreasonable. After citing <em>Nazir, </em>Serri asserts, \u201c[m]oreover, as pointed out in Plaintiff\u2019s [47-page] written responses to Defendants\u2019 evidentiary objections . . . , Defendants\u2019 objections were without merit and it was erroneous to sustain them.\u201d It is inappropriate for an appellate brief to incorporate by reference arguments contained in a document filed in the trial court. <em>(Soukup </em>v. <em>Law Offices of Herbert Hafif </em>(2006) 39 Cal.4th 260, 294, fn. 20 [46 Cal.Rptr.3d 638, 139 P.3d 30] <em>(Soukup)) </em>Such practice does not comply with the requirement that an appellate brief \u201csupport each point by argument and, if possible, by citation of authority.\u201d (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 8.204(a)(1)(B).) We shall therefore disregard Serri\u2019s effort to incorporate by reference arguments she made below in response to Defendants\u2019 objections to her evidence. <em>(Soukup, </em>at p. 294, fn. 20.)</p>\n<p id=\"b728-5\">The only other argument Serri makes regarding her documentary evidence is the contention that the court erred when it sustained Defendants\u2019 objections that her evidence lacked foundation. Serri does not, however, discuss this point in the context of any specific exhibit or exhibits. Serri argues that almost all of her exhibits were produced by Defendants in response to her document requests and that \u201cby producing their documents in discovery, [Defendants] have admitted their genuineness.\u201d The legal authority Serri cites, however, neither supports nor addresses her contention.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b728-6\">The Individual Defendants concede that many of Serri\u2019s documents bear Bates-stamped numbers indicating they were produced by Defendants. They contend, however, that dozens of exhibits consist of handwritten notes by unidentified authors and other items that require additional authentication. They argue\", \u201cNot every document that comes out of an opposing party\u2019s files is automatically admissible against even that party, much less as to all others,\u201d and that more is required to establish admissibility. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"855\">*855</page-number>Documents obtained in discovery in response to a request for production of documents may be used to support or oppose a motion for summary judgment, but must be presented in admissible form. This means the evidence must be (1) properly identified and authenticated, (2) admissible under the secondary evidence rule, (3) nonhearsay or admissible under some exception to the hearsay rule, and (4) a complete record, not selected portions of the document. (Weil &amp; Brown, Cal. Practice Guide: Civil Procedure Before Trial (The Rutter Group 2013) If 10:168 to 10:169, pp. 10-70 to 10-71 (rev. # 1, 2013).) Unless the opposing party admits the genuineness of the document, the proponent of the evidence must present declarations or other \u201cevidence sufficient to sustain a finding that it is the writing that the proponent of the evidence claims it is.\u201d (Evid. Code, \u00a7 1400; see Evid. Code, \u00a7 1410 et seq. for methods of authenticating documents.)</p>\n<p id=\"b729-5\">Serri\u2019s only effort to authenticate her exhibits was Komhauser\u2019s declaration that the \u201cexhibits attached hereto are true and correct copies of the originals or excerpts of the originals or copies of documents produced by Defendants in this action or excerpts of the originals of depositions or transcripts of investigations in this case.\u201d Since the Individual Defendants have briefed the issue, we shall address the propriety of the trial court\u2019s order sustaining Defendants\u2019 objections to the handwritten notes.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-6\">Serri\u2019s evidence includes more than 20 exhibits that consist of handwritten notes (see, e.g., exhibits 38, 43, 68, 75, 76). According to Serri, these are McDonald\u2019s notes. However, none of the handwritten notes are signed and there is no evidence they were written by McDonald. To authenticate the notes, Serri could have propounded requests for admission asking McDonald to admit their authenticity and to admit that she wrote them (\u00a7 2033.010). Serri could also have asked McDonald to authenticate the notes when she took McDonald\u2019s deposition. There is no evidence in the record that she did either of these things. Furthermore, Defendants did not rely on the notes in their' own submission. <em>(Ambriz v. Kelegian </em>(2007) 146 Cal.App.4th 1519, 1526-1529 [53 Cal.Rptr.3d 700] [trial court erred in sustaining authentication, foundation, and other objections to deposition excerpts in the plaintiff\u2019s evidence where the moving parties relied on the same depositions].) In addition, many of the notes, to the extent we can decipher them, appear to document conversations with other persons and are therefore hearsay. Since Serri did not meet her burden of demonstrating the admissibility of the handwritten notes, the trial court did not err in sustaining objections to them.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-7\">As for the remainder of Serri\u2019s documentary exhibits, this case is distinguishable from <em>Nazir </em>since Defendants\u2019 objections do not suffer from the same defects as those in <em>Nazir. </em>Serri fails to cite examples of objections that were frivolous and many objections are supported by rules of evidence. On <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"856\">*856</page-number>the other hand, our review of the record discloses a problem with the trial court\u2019s ruling: some of the exhibits Defendants objected to were identical to documents Defendants had submitted in support of their motions for summary judgment (compare Serri\u2019s exhibits 66, 124, 181 with Individual Defendants\u2019 exhibits L, R, and BB). The Individual Defendants objected to these exhibits on authentication, foundation, hearsay, and relevance grounds; the University objected that one was hearsay and another was irrelevant. Since Defendants had relied on this very same evidence, there was no merit to these objections and they should not have been sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-4\">We also look to <em>Reid </em>for guidance. The defendant employer in <em>Reid </em>had raised more than 175 separate objections to the plaintiff employee\u2019s evidence opposing summary judgment. <em>(Reid, supra, </em>50 Cal.4th at p. 533.) Rather than rule on the objections, the trial court made what was known as a <em>Biljac </em>ruling and stated, \u201c \u2018The Court declines to render formal rulings on evidentiary objections. In ruling, the Court relied on competent and admissible evidence pursuant to <em>Biljac Associates v. First Interstate Bank </em>[(1990)] 218 Cal.App.3d 1410, 1419-1429 [267 Cal.Rptr. 819].\u2019 \u201d <em>(Reid, </em>at p. 533.) The <em>Reid </em>court disapproved of <em>Biljac </em>\u201cto the extent it permits the trial court to avoid ruling on specific evidentiary objections.\u201d <em>(Reid, </em>at p. 532 &amp; fn. 8.) The court held that the \u201ctrial court must rule expressly on those objections. [Citation.] If the trial court fails to rule, the objections are preserved on appeal.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 532, fn. omitted, citing <em>Vineyard Springs Estates v. Superior Court </em>(2004) 120 Cal.App.4th, 633, 642-643 [15 Cal.Rptr.3d 587] [trial courts have a duty to rule on evidentiary objections presented in proper form].)</p>\n<p id=\"b730-5\">The Supreme Court \u201crecognize[d] that it has become common practice for litigants to flood the trial courts with inconsequential written evidentiary objections, without focusing on those that are critical. Trial courts are often faced with \u2018innumerable objections commonly thrown up by the parties as part of the all-out artillery exchange that summary judgment has become.\u2019 [Citation.] Indeed, the <em>Biljac </em>procedure itself was designed to ease the extreme burden on trial courts when all \u2018too often\u2019 \u2018litigants file blunderbuss objections to virtually every item of evidence submitted.\u2019 [Citations.] To counter that disturbing trend, [the Supreme Court] encourage[d] parties to raise only meritorious objections to items of evidence that are legitimately in dispute and pertinent to the disposition of the summary judgment motion. In other words, litigants should focus on the objections that really count. Otherwise, they may face informal reprimands or formal sanctions for engaging in abusive practices. At the very least, at the summary judgment hearing, the <em>parties\u2014with the trial court\u2019s </em>encouragement\u2014should specify the evidentiary objections they consider important, so that the court can focus its rulings on evidentiary matters that are critical in resolving the summary judgment motion.\u201d <em>(Reid, supra, </em>50 Cal.4th at pp. 532-533, fns. omitted, italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b731-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"857\">*857</page-number>As we have noted, another issue in <em>Reid </em>was the effect of the trial court\u2019s <em>Biljac </em>ruling and whether it resulted in a waiver of the objections and, if not, whether the objections should be deemed to have been sustained or overruled. <em>(Reid, </em>at pp. 533-535.) The court held that \u201cif the trial court fails to rule expressly on specific evidentiary objections, it is presumed that the objections have been overruled, the trial court considered the evidence in ruling on the merits of the summary judgment motion, and the objections are preserved on appeal.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 534.)</p>\n<p id=\"b731-5\">The trial court\u2019s ruling here is different from the <em>Biljac </em>ruling that was disapproved of in <em>Reid, </em>but is equally problematic. The trial court in <em>Reid </em>declined to rule on the evidentiary objections, but stated that it was relying only \u201c \u2018on competent and admissible evidence.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Reid, supra, </em>50 Cal.4th at p. 533.) In this case, the court ruled on the objections\u2014its blanket ruling sustained all of the objections and observed that many of the exhibits lacked foundation, were inadmissible hearsay, or were irrelevant because they were not cited in Serri\u2019s opposition. This blanket ruling was \u201chardly a ruling,\u201d provided no meaningful basis for review, and could be treated as a failure to rule. <em>(Nazir, supra, </em>178 Cal.App.4th at p. 255.) The ruling was similar to trial court rulings under the <em>Biljac </em>procedure that was disapproved of in <em>Reid </em>since the result in both situations is a failure to rule on the objections.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-6\">After the court sustained all of Defendants\u2019 objections, it stated that even if Serri\u2019s evidence was admissible, it would not impact or change any of the court\u2019s rulings. This statement does not provide any more guidance than a <em>Biljac </em>ruling. Defendants objected to all but 13 of Serri\u2019s 408 exhibits. Under the trial court\u2019s ruling, then, either most of Serri\u2019s evidence was excluded or all of it was admitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-7\">Given the number of objections and the fact that some were sustained in error, we follow <em>Nazir </em>and hold that the trial court abused its discretion by issuing a blanket ruling on Defendants\u2019 objections.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> <em>(Nazir, supra, </em>178 Cal.App.4th at p. 255.)</p>\n<p id=\"b731-8\">Finally, \u201c[i]n regard to whether the evidentiary ruling was harmless, an erroneous evidentiary ruling requires reversal only if \u2018there is a reasonable probability that a result more favorable to the appealing party would have been reached in the absence of the error. [Citation.]\u2019 \u201d <em>(Palms, supra, </em>210 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"858\">*858</page-number>Cal.App.4th at p. 1449; see Evid. Code, \u00a7 354.) In this case, the court\u2019s error in issuing a blanket evidentiary ruling does not change the outcome of the motions because Serri\u2019s admissible evidence does not create a triable issue of material fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-4\">We have already addressed Defendants\u2019 objections to the handwritten notes and held that the court properly sustained them. Rather than discuss any other exhibits here, we will discuss the admissibility of other evidence that Serri relies on in the balance of this opinion as it relates to the substantive issues she raises on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-5\">D. <em>Objections to John Fox\u2019s Declaration</em></p>\n<p id=\"b732-6\">On appeal, Serri relies on the portion of Fox\u2019s declaration in which he opines that the University would not suffer any adverse consequences as a result of not having an AAR Without deciding whether the trial court erred when it sustained Defendants\u2019 objections to this portion of Fox\u2019s declaration, we shall assume this portion of the declaration is admissible and will consider it in our review on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-7\">IV. <em>The Court Properly Granted Summary Judgment</em></p>\n<p id=\"b732-8\">We begin by summarizing the legal principles that govern motions for summary adjudication and summary judgment in general. We then discuss rules that are unique to summary adjudication and summary judgment in employment cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-9\">A. <em>Standard of Review</em></p>\n<p id=\"b732-10\">We review an order granting summary judgment de novo. <em>(Aguilar v. Atlantic Richfield Co. </em>(2001) 25 Cal.4th 826, 860 [107 Cal.Rptr.2d 841, 24 P.3d 493] <em>(Aguilar); Guz v. Bechtel National, Inc. </em>(2000) 24 Cal.4th 317, 334 [100 Cal.Rptr.2d 352, 8 P.3d 1089] <em>(Guz).) </em>The trial court\u2019s ruling on a motion for summary adjudication, like that on -a motion for summary judgment, is subject to this court\u2019s independent review. <em>(Certain Underwriters at Lloyd\u2019s of London v. Superior Court </em>(2001) 24 Cal.4th 945, 972 [103 Cal.Rptr.2d 672, 16 P.3d 94].) In determining whether summary judgment was proper, we analyze the propriety of granting summary adjudication with regard to each of Serri\u2019s causes of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-11\">In undertaking our independent review, we apply the same three-step analysis used by the trial court. First, we identify the issues framed by the pleadings. Second, we determine whether the moving party has established facts justifying judgment in its favor. Finally, in most cases, if the moving <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"859\">*859</page-number>party has carried its initial burden, we decide whether the opposing party has demonstrated the existence of a triable issue of material fact. <em>(Varni Bros. Corp. v. Wine World, Inc. </em>(1995) 35 Cal.App.4th 880, 886-887 [41 Cal.Rptr.2d 740].)</p>\n<p id=\"b733-5\">In performing our review, we view the evidence in a light favorable to the losing party (Serri), liberally construing her evidentiary submission while strictly scrutinizing the moving party\u2019s own showing and resolving any evidentiary doubts or ambiguities in the losing party\u2019s favor. <em>(Saelzler </em>v. <em>Advanced Group 400 </em>(2001) 25 Cal.4th 763, 768-769 [107 Cal.Rptr.2d 617, 23 P.3d 1143].)</p>\n<p id=\"b733-6\">B. <em>General Rules Regarding Summary Judgment and Summary Adjudication</em></p>\n<p id=\"b733-7\"><em>\u201cA </em>motion for summary adjudication shall be granted only if it completely disposes of a cause of action, an affirmative defense, a claim for damages, or an issue of duty.\u201d (\u00a7 437c, subd. (f)(1).) The statute thus authorizes motions for summary adjudication that \u201creduce the costs and length of litigation\u201d by limiting the substantive areas of dispute. <em>(Lilienthal &amp; Fowler v. Superior Court </em>(1993) 12 Cal.App.4th 1848, 1852 [16 Cal.Rptr.2d 458]; see <em>Catalano </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(2000) 82 Cal.App.4th 91, 97 [97 Cal.Rptr.2d 842].)</p>\n<p id=\"b733-8\">Summary judgment motions serve a similar purpose, namely \u201cto identify those cases in which there is no factual issue which warrants the time and cost of factfinding by trial.\u201d <em>(Martin v. Lockheed Missiles &amp; Space Co. </em>(1994) 29 Cal.App.4th 1718, 1735 [35 Cal.Rptr.2d 181] (Martin).) Thus, the object of both procedures is \u201cto cut through the parties\u2019 pleadings\u201d to determine whether trial is necessary to resolve their dispute. <em>(Aguilar, supra, </em>25 Cal.4th at p. 843.)</p>\n<p id=\"b733-9\">Summary adjudication motions are \u201cprocedurally identical\u201d to summary judgment motions. <em>(Dunn </em>v. <em>County of Santa Barbara </em>(2006) 135 Cal.App.4th 1281, 1290 [38 Cal.Rptr.3d 316].) A summary judgment motion \u201cshall be granted if all the papers submitted show that there is no triable issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\u201d (\u00a7 437c, subd. (c).) To be entitled to judgment as a matter of law, the moving party must show by admissible evidence that the \u201caction has no merit or that there is no defense\u201d thereto. <em>(Id., </em>subd. (a).) A defendant moving for summary judgment meets this burden by presenting evidence demonstrating that one or more elements of the cause of action cannot be established or that there is a complete defense to the action. <em>(Id., </em>subds. <em>(o), </em>(p)(2); <em>Aguilar, supra, </em>25 Cal.4th at pp. 849-850, 853-854.) Once the defendant makes this showing, the burden shifts to the plaintiff to show that a triable issue of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"860\">*860</page-number>material fact exists as to that cause of action or defense. (\u00a7 437c, subd. (p)(2); <em>see-Aguilar, </em>at p. 850.) Material facts are those that relate to the issues in the case as framed by the pleadings. <em>(Juge v. County of Sacramento </em>(1993) 12 Cal.App.4th 59, 67 [15 Cal.Rptr.2d 598].) There is a genuine issue of material fact if, and only if, the evidence would allow a reasonable trier of fact to find the underlying fact in favor of the party opposing the motion in accordance with the applicable standard of proof. <em>(Aguilar, supra, </em>25 Cal.4th at p. 845.)</p>\n<p id=\"b734-4\">C. <em>Summary Judgment/Summary Adjudication in Employment Cases</em></p>\n<p id=\"b734-5\">Both federal and state laws prohibit employers from discriminating against employees on the basis of race, sex, or ethnic origin. (Gov. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 12940, subd. (a), 12941, subd. (a); 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e et seq. [title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (Pub.L. No. 88-352 (July 2, 1964) 78 Stat. 241)].)</p>\n<p id=\"b734-6\">In cases alleging employment discrimination, we analyze the trial court\u2019s decision on a motion for summary judgment using a three-step process that is based on the burden-shifting test that was established by the United States Supreme Court for trials of employment discrimination claims in <em>McDonnell Douglas Corp. </em>v. <em>Green </em>(1973) 411 U.S. 792 [36 L.Ed.2d 668, 93 S.Ct. 1817]. (See, e.g., <em>Guz, supra, </em>24 Cal.4th at pp. 354-355; <em>Reeves v. Safeway Stores, Inc. </em>(2004) 121 Cal.App.4th 95, 111 [16 Cal.Rptr.3d 717] <em>(Reeves).) </em>This test \u201creflects the principle that direct evidence of intentional discrimination is rare, and that such claims must usually be proved circumstantially. Thus, by successive steps of increasingly narrow focus, the test allows discrimination to be inferred from facts that create a reasonable likelihood of bias and are not satisfactorily explained.\u201d <em>(Guz, supra, </em>24 Cal.4th at p. 354.)</p>\n<p id=\"b734-7\">At trial, under the first step of the <em>McDonnell Douglas </em>framework, the plaintiff may raise a presumption of discrimination by presenting a \u201cprima facie case,\u201d the components of which vary depending upon the nature of the claim, but typically require evidence that \u201c \u2018(1) [the plaintiff] was a member of a protected class, (2) [the plaintiff] was qualified for the position he [or she] sought or was performing competently in the position . . . held, (3) [the plaintiff] suffered an adverse employment action, such as termination, demotion, or denial of an available job, and (4) some other circumstance [that] suggests discriminatory motive.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Reeves, supra, </em>121 Cal.App.4th at pp. 111-112.) \u201cA satisfactory showing to this effect gives rise to a presumption of discrimination which, if unanswered by the employer, is mandatory\u2014it requires judgment for the plaintiff.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 112, citing <em>Guz, supra, </em>at pp. 355-356.) However, under the second step of the test, \u201cthe employer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"861\">*861</page-number>may dispel the presumption merely by articulating a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for the challenged action. [Citation.] At that point the presumption disappears.\u201d (Reeves, at p. 112.) Under the third step of the test, the \u201cplaintiff must . . . have the opportunity to attack the employer\u2019s proffered reasons as pretexts for discrimination, or to offer any other evidence of discriminatory motive.\u201d <em>(Guz, supra, </em>at p. 356.)</p>\n<p id=\"b735-5\">The <em>McDonnell Douglas </em>framework is modified in the summary judgment context. In a summary judgment motion in \u201can employment discrimination case, the employer, as the moving party, has the initial burden to present admissible evidence showing either that one or more elements of plaintiff\u2019s prima facie case is lacking or that the adverse employment action was based upon legitimate, nondiscriminatory factors.\u201d <em>(Hicks v. KNTV Television, Inc. </em>(2008) 160 Cal.App.4th 994, 1003 [73 Cal.Rptr.3d 240], citing <em>Guz, supra, </em>24 Cal.4th at p. 357.) Defendants here presented evidence that Serri was terminated for legitimate reasons that were \u201cunrelated to unlawful discrimination.\u201d <em>(Hicks, </em>at p. 1003.)</p>\n<p id=\"b735-6\">\u201c[I]f nondiscriminatory, [the employer\u2019s] true reasons need not necessarily have been wise or correct. [Citations.] While the objective soundness of an employer\u2019s proffered reasons supports their credibility . . . , the ultimate issue is simply whether the employer acted with <em>a motive to discriminate illegally. </em>Thus, \u2018legitimate\u2019 reasons [citation] in this <em>context are </em>reasons that are <em>facially unrelated to prohibited bias, </em>and which, if true, would thus preclude a finding of <em>discrimination.\u201d (Guz, supra, </em>24 Cal.4th at p. 358, original italics.) Examples of legitimate reasons are a failure to meet performance standards <em>(Trop v. Sony Pictures Entertainment Inc. </em>(2005) 129 Cal.App.4th 1133, 1149 [29 Cal.Rptr.3d 144]) or a loss of confidence in an employee <em>(Arteaga v. Brink\u2019s, Inc. </em>(2008) 163 Cal.App.4th 327, 352 [77 Cal.Rptr.3d 654]).</p>\n<p id=\"b735-7\">If the employer meets its initial burden, the burden shifts to the employee to \u201cdemonstrate a triable issue by producing substantial evidence that the employer\u2019s stated reasons were untrue or pretextual, or that the employer acted with a discriminatory <em>animus, </em>such that a reasonable trier of fact could conclude that the employer engaged in intentional discrimination or other unlawful action.\u201d <em>(Cucuzza v. City of Santa Clara </em>(2002) 104 Cal.App.4th 1031, 1038 [128 Cal.Rptr.2d 660] <em>(Cucuzza).)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b735-8\">In <em>Guz, </em>the Supreme Court emphasized that \u201cthe great weight of federal and California authority holds that an employer is entitled to summary judgment if, considering the employer\u2019s innocent explanation for its actions, the evidence as a whole is insufficient to permit a rational inference that the employer\u2019s actual motive was discriminatory.\u201d <em>(Guz, supra, </em>24 Cal.4th at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"862\">*862</page-number>p. 361, fn. omitted.) It is not sufficient for an employee to make a bare prima facie showing or to simply deny the credibility of the employer\u2019s witnesses or to speculate as to discriminatory motive. <em>(Hersant </em>v. <em>Department of Social Services </em>(1997) 57 Cal.App.4th 997, 1004 [67 Cal.Rptr.2d 483] <em>(Hersant); Wallis v. J.R. Simplot Co. </em>(1994) 26 F.3d 885, 890; <em>Compton v. City of Santee </em>(1993) 12 Cal.App.4th 591, 595-596 [15 Cal.Rptr.2d 660].) Rather it is incumbent upon the employee to produce \u201csubstantial responsive evidence\u201d demonstrating the existence of a material triable controversy as to pretext or discriminatory animus on the part of the employer. <em>(University of Southern California v. Superior Court </em>(1990) 222 Cal.App.3d 1028, 1039 [272 Cal.Rptr. 264]; <em>Martin, </em>29 Cal.App.4th at p. 1735.)</p>\n<p id=\"b736-4\">D. <em>First and Second Causes of Action: The Trial Court Properly Granted Summary Adjudication of Serri\u2019s Employment Discrimination and Tortious Discharge Claims</em></p>\n<p id=\"b736-5\">The trial court granted the University\u2019s motions for summary adjudication' of Serri\u2019s causes of action for employment discrimination, tortious discharge, and retaliation in violation of the FEHA, finding that the University had presented sufficient evidence that Serri\u2019s termination was based upon legitimate, nondiscriminatory factors and that she was terminated for failing to competently perform her job duties. The court also found that Serri failed to produce substantial evidence that the University\u2019s reasons were untrue or pretextual or that the University acted with a discriminatory animus.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-6\">On appeal, Serri argues that the trial court erred because it failed to consider all of the evidence and it improperly weighed conflicting evidence. In particular, Serri contends the court failed to consider evidence that the University prevented her from doing her job by refusing to (1) hire a consultant to help her prepare the AAP\u2019s, (2) provide the data she needed to complete the AAP\u2019s, (3) train her assistant, Linda Jocewicz, to use certain computer software so she could retrieve , the pertinent data herself, and (4) allow Serri to attend seminars to update her skills. Serri also contends the court failed to consider that preparation of the AAP\u2019s was a minor part of her job.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-7\">The University contends Serri was terminated for legitimate, nondiscriminatory business reasons, namely that she (1) \u201cfailed to prepare, develop and implement\u201d the University\u2019s AAP\u2019s for three years; (2) failed to disclose the nonexistence of those AAP\u2019s to her supervisors; and (3) made \u201cmisrepresentations\u201d related to the AAP\u2019s. These are legitimate, nondiscriminatory reasons to explain Serri\u2019s termination and are sufficient to shift to Serri the burden of showing a triable issue of their falsity and ultimately of discriminatory motive instead. <em>(Kelly v. Stamps.com Inc. </em>(2005) 135 Cal.App.4th 1088, 1098 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"863\">*863</page-number>[38 Cal.Rptr.3d 240].) Our analysis will therefore focus on the question whether Serri satisfied her burden.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-5\">\u201c[E]vidence that the employer\u2019s claimed reason [for the employee\u2019s termination] is false\u2014such as that it conflicts with other evidence, or appears to have been contrived after the fact\u2014will tend to suggest that the employer seeks to conceal the real reason for its actions, and this in turn may support an inference that the real reason was unlawful.\u201d <em>(Mamou v. Trendwest Resorts, Inc. </em>(2008) 165 Cal.App.4th 686, 715 [81 Cal.Rptr.3d 406], original italics.) \u201c \u2018The [employee] cannot simply show that the employer\u2019s decision was wrong or mistaken, since the factual dispute at issue is whether discriminatory animus motivated the employer, not whether the employer is wise, shrewd, prudent, or competent. [Citations.] Rather, the [employee] must demonstrate such weaknesses, implausibilities, inconsistencies, incoherencies, or contradictions in the employer\u2019s proffered legitimate reasons for its action that a reasonable factfinder <em>could </em>rationally find them \u201cunworthy of credence,\u201d [citation], and hence infer \u201cthat the employer did not act for the [the asserted] non-discriminatory reasons.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>(Hersant, supra, </em>57 Cal.App.4th at p. 1005, original italics.) \u201cLogically, disbelief of an Employer\u2019s stated reason for a termination gives rise to a compelling inference that the Employer had a different,.unstated motivation, but it does not, without more, reasonably give rise to an inference that the motivation was a prohibited one.\u201d <em>(McGrory v. Applied Signal Technology, Inc. </em>(2013) 212 Cal.App.4th 1510, 1531-1532 [152 Cal.Rptr.3d 154].)</p>\n<p id=\"b737-6\">Serri attempts to demonstrate falsity and pretext by arguing that there was a disputed factual issue on the question whether preparation of the AAP\u2019s was the most important part of her job. Indeed, Defendants relied on evidence, all of which was authored by Serri, that the preparation of the AAP was one of her primary job duties. The job description Serri prepared for McDonald in June 2006 stated more than once that \u201cdevelop[ing] and implementing] the annual affirmative action program for the University\u201d was one of her duties. The personal evaluation she prepared for Father Locatelli in July 2004 discussed her work on the AAP. Her November 2005 letter to Father Locatelli, in which she complained about her salary, listed supervising the preparation of the \u201cfederally mandated annual\u201d AAP as one of her job duties and described the AAP as \u201cpivotal and essential for us for obtaining and retaining federal grants.\u201d In deposition, Serri confirmed that these statements were true. And in her e-mail to McDonald, protesting the decision to have McDonald take over responsibility for the 2006 AAP, Serri described preparation of the AAP as \u201cone of the roles that define my position.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b737-7\">Serri now disputes that preparation of the AAP\u2019s was \u201cthe most important part of her job.\u201d She cites to Hirsch\u2019s testimony that preparation of the AAP <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"864\">*864</page-number>took only 15 to 20 hours of her time since she was authorized to use a consultant. But whether it was the most important part of Serri\u2019s job is not material or at issue. Evidence presented by both sides supports the conclusion that Serri\u2019s duties included preparing the AAP and that she failed to prepare the narrative portion of the AAP (the part that she had previously prepared personally) for three years.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-4\">In support of her contention that the University\u2019s reasons for terminating her were untrue or pretextual, Serri attempts to contradict her own deposition testimony that after the University became a federal contractor it was \u201cobligated to create the [AAP].\u201d Citing Fox\u2019s declaration, she argues that she opined \u201cincorrectly\u201d that the University had to have an AAP. On appeal, she contends she was not an expert in AAP compliance and that the trial court ignored Fox\u2019s declaration that the failure to have an AAP for three years would result in \u201cno sanctions, fines or adverse consequences\u201d to the University.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-5\">This argument contradicts some of Serri\u2019s documentary evidence (documents authored by Serri in which she stated that the University was required to have an AAP) as well as her own deposition testimony. We also note that other portions of Serri\u2019s brief (her statement of facts) state that federal contactors like the University are required \u201cto have an AAP in place and update it annually.\u201d Fox declared that in his opinion, \u201cno sanctions, fines or adverse consequences will OR CAN ensue against a federal contractor which . . . agrees to provide OFCCP [(the Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs)] with a delinquent AAP.\u201d This does not create a triable issue on the question whether the University was required to have an AAP. Indeed, the University does not dispute that it suffered no adverse consequences as a result of Serri\u2019s failure to prepare the AAP\u2019s.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-6\">Serri also argues that the University\u2019s stated reason for firing her was untrue since she presented evidence that she had prepared partial AAP\u2019s for 2005 and 2006, and the University prevented her from preparing complete AAP\u2019s by failing to provide data and a consultant. But it was undisputed that Serri did not prepare the narrative portion of the AAP (the part that she prepared as contrasted with the parts that her assistant prepared) for three years, and that she prepared the draft narratives she presented to McDonald and Father Locatelli on the eve of their October 13, 2006 meeting.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-7\">Serri also relies on her deposition testimony that in 1992, 1993, or 1994, after she showed one of her first AAP\u2019s to Father Locatelli, she \u201csensed\u201d that he was reluctant to sign it. Serri testified that Father Locatelli questioned whether the goals set forth in the AAP were quotas and that she \u201csensed he was not getting it and it was a source of discomfort for him, so she never <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"865\">*865</page-number>showed it to him again.\u201d That Father Locatelli raised questions about the goals set in early AAP\u2019s, long before the University became a federal contractor, does not mean that he and the University did not recognize the need to comply with the AAP requirement after it became a federal contractor in 2000.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-5\">Serri also relies on her deposition testimony that Father Locatelli refused to supervise her after 2003 and never asked her about the AAP\u2019s. Based on this evidence, Serri argues that since the lack of an AAP was of no concern to Father Locatelli, he could not use her failure to prepare the AAP\u2019s between 2004 and 2006 as an excuse to fire her and that, therefore, the reason given for her termination was a pretext.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-6\">Citing Fox\u2019s declaration, Serri argues that the University knew that any noncompliance with the AAP requirement was easily correctable with an AAP consultant and that it would not result in any adverse consequences for the University. Serri\u2019s argument on this point fails, however, because Fox\u2019s declaration was prepared in August 2011, more than four years after Serri was terminated. Serri does not point to any evidence that anyone at the University knew that the lack of an AAP would allegedly not result in adverse consequences when the University terminated her in March 2007. To the contrary, undisputed evidence indicates that Serri (the only person at the University with any experience in this area) told McDonald and Father Locatelli that the existing AAP was indefensible and that the University was likely to be audited by the federal government.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-7\">Having reviewed Serri\u2019s evidence and arguments, we conclude that a trier of fact could not reasonably conclude that the University\u2019s stated reasons for terminating Serri \u201cwere implausible, or inconsistent or baseless.\u201d (Hersant, supra, 57 Cal.App.4th at p. 1009.) We therefore hold that Serri has not met her burden of producing substantial evidence that the University\u2019s reason for terminating her were pretextual or false and used merely to veil an unlawful act of discrimination.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> (57 Cal.App.4th at p. 1009.)</p>\n<p id=\"b740-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"866\">*866</page-number>Serri also contends that she proved discriminatory animus. Serri relies on the following evidence. Her successor (Hirsch) was a White female. McDonald and Hirsch, who were Caucasian females, were allowed to hire an AAP consultant. Serri argues that since there was no real reason to fire her or treat her differently, the only logical explanation for the different treatment is her national origin.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> But in her opening brief, Serri herself explained why the University had to hire an AAP consultant for Hirsch and McDonald: \u201cHirs[c]h had no ability to prepare AAPs\u201d and McDonald \u201chad no AAP experience.\u201d On the other hand, Serri had been preparing AAP\u2019s since 1992 and held herself out as the University\u2019s expert on AAP\u2019s.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-4\">Serri also claims disparate treatment. She argues that she was treated differently from a high-ranking \u201cwhite male who made massive job performance errors\u201d that cost the University \u201cover $6 million\u201d but was \u201cnot fired or even demoted.\u201d In support of this contention, Serri produced a newspaper article that appeared in the Metro (a Silicon Valley weekly newspaper) in November 2003. There is no evidence the newspaper article was produced by Defendants in discovery and Komhauser, Serri\u2019s counsel, failed to authenticate it in his declaration. In addition, the article is clearly hearsay. Defendants objected to the article on the grounds of authentication and hearsay; none of the hearsay exceptions Serri advanced in response to the objection apply.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> We therefore hold that the newspaper article was inadmissible and the court properly sustained Defendants\u2019 objections to it. Most importantly, the article does not support the factual assertions for which it is cited in Serri\u2019s brief. We shall therefore disregard Serri\u2019s arguments based on the newspaper article.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-5\">Serri also argues that Father Locatelli and Joe Sugg, an employee in the University\u2019s facilities department, made \u201crepeated\u201d stray remarks about her ethnicity and that \u201cethnic remarks, even \u2018stray remarks\u2019 when coupled with other evidence of pretext can defeat summary judgment.\u201d But the argument portion of her brief does not state what those remarks were or tell us where we can find evidence of those remarks in the 5,223-page record. As to this contention, Serri has failed to meet her burden on appeal of providing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"867\">*867</page-number>reasoned argument as to each point raised. <em>(People v. Stanley </em>(1995) 10 Cal.4th 764, 793 [42 Cal.Rptr.2d 543, 897 P.2d 481] <em>(Stanley).) </em>We will, nonetheless, address her contentions by considering statements made in other parts of her brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-5\">Under the stray remarks doctrine, which has been employed by federal courts and some California courts, on summary judgment, \u201ca \u2018stray\u2019 discriminatory remark that a court determines is unconnected to the adverse employment action is insufficient evidence of a discriminatory motive, as a matter of law, and may be wholly disregarded by the court.\u201d <em>(Sandell </em>v. <em>Taylor-Listug, Inc. </em>(2010) 188 Cal.App.4th 297, 320 [115 Cal.Rptr.3d 453] <em>(Sandell).) </em>In <em>Reid, </em>the Supreme Court held that California courts are not to apply the stray remarks doctrine because \u201c \u2018its categorical exclusion of evidence might lead to unfair results.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Ibid., </em>citing <em>Reid, supra, </em>50 Cal.4th at p. 517.) Instead, such remarks are to be considered along with all the other evidence in the record in determining whether a rational inference of discrimination exists. <em>(Sandell, </em>at p. 320.)</p>\n<p id=\"b741-6\">In her statement of facts, Serri points to her deposition testimony that Father Locatelli made a discriminatory remark about her clothing once when he said the shawl she was wearing looked like a poncho, and that he made an ethnic remark when he told her he liked her hairstyle better when she blew her curly hair dry because it looked more relaxed and professional. Serri also relies on her deposition testimony that Father Locatelli was \u201cabusive\u201d toward her when he met her in public. According to Serri, instead of saying \u201cHi\u201d or asking \u201cHow are you,\u201d he would say, \u201cWhat do you want?\u201d But Serri does not explain how these statements relate to her ethnicity or national origin. People of many ethnicities and national origins, for example, have curly hair. Nor do we see anything derogatory in saying her shawl looked like a poncho.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-7\">Serri claims Joe Sugg made a discriminatory and demeaning remark to her in 2000 when he showed her a potential site for her new office in a building on the outskirts of campus. He said, \u201cIt\u2019s a wonderful location, look at all the nice places to eat around here,\u201d which Serri understood to mean a nearby taquer\u00eda. Serri also cites the deposition testimony of Jane Curry in which Curry stated that her (Curry\u2019s) department head told Curry she would be paid better if she was less outspoken, not divorced, and Catholic. Serri argues this evidence supports the conclusion that Father Locatelli did not like women, did not like Latinas, and condoned a discriminatory atmosphere at the University.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b742-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"868\">*868</page-number>In our view, this evidence does not demonstrate a discriminatory animus or motive. At best, even when examined in the aggregate, this evidence raised only a weak suspicion that discrimination was a basis for Serri\u2019s termination. This weak suspicion may have sustained Serri\u2019s burden of proving a prima facie case, but it does not amount to substantial evidence of discrimination necessary to defeat summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-4\">We conclude that Serri failed to meet her burden of producing substantial evidence that the University\u2019s stated reasons for firing her were untrue or pretextual, or that the University acted with a discriminatory animus, such that a reasonable trier of fact could conclude that the University engaged in intentional discrimination or other unlawful action. <em>(Cucuzza, supra, </em>104 Cal.App.4th 1031, 1038.)</p>\n<p id=\"b742-5\">E. <em>Second and Tenth Causes of Action: The Trial Court Properly Granted Summary Adjudication of Serri\u2019s Tortious Discharge and Retaliation in Violation of the FEHA Claims</em></p>\n<p id=\"b742-6\">Serri\u2019s tenth cause of action alleges that the University terminated her in retaliation for her \u201clawful and protected actions in pursuing discrimination, harassment, and equal pay claims with the EEOC and DFEH.\u201d Her second cause of action for tortious discharge also alleges that she was fired in retaliation for filing complaints with the EEOC and DFEH.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-7\">Serri argues that the University retaliated against her by removing her AAP duties on October 19, 2006 (two weeks after she filed her first DFEH claim) and terminating her on March 7, 2007. Her only contention on appeal regarding these two causes of action, separate and apart from her argument regarding her discrimination claim, is that \u201c[t]he close timing between her EEOC filings and her termination is circumstantial evidence that she was terminated for exercising her public policy right to enforce state and federal anti discrimination [sic] laws.\u201d <em>Loggins v. Kaiser Permanente Internat. </em>(2007) 151 Cal.App.4th 1102 [60 Cal.Rptr.3d 45] held that a prima facie showing of \u201ctemporal proximity, although sufficient to shift the burden to the employer to articulate a nondiscriminatory reason for the adverse employment action, does not, without more, suffice also to satisfy the [employee\u2019s burden] to show a triable issue of fact on whether the employer\u2019s articulated reason was untrue and pretextual.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1112.) Since we have already concluded that Serri cannot meet her burden of showing that the stated reasons for her termination were false or pretextual, we reject her contention that the timing in this case, in itself, was sufficient to create a triable issue regarding her tortious discharge and retaliation claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"869\">*869</page-number>F. <em>Eleventh Cause of Action: The Trial Court Properly Granted Summary Adjudication of Serri\u2019s Harassment Claim</em></p>\n<p id=\"b743-5\">Serri\u2019s eleventh cause of action alleges harassment in violation of the FEHA (Gov. Code, \u00a7 12940, subd. (j)) by the University, Father Locatelli, McDonald, and Veit on account of Serri\u2019s national origin, age, and sex.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b743-6\">Government Code section 12940, subdivision (j), defines \u201cunlawful employment practice\u201d to include harassment in the workplace based on national origin, sex, and age. \u201cUnder the statute \u2018harassment\u2019 in the workplace can take the form of \u2018discriminatory intimidation, ridicule and insult\u2019 that is \u2018 \u201c \u2018sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter the conditions of the victim\u2019s employment and create an abusive working environment.\u2019 \u201d \u2019 [Citations.] Moreover, harassing conduct takes place \u2018outside the scope of necessary job performance, conduct presumably engaged in for personal gratification, because of meanness or bigotry, or for other personal motives.\u2019 <em>(Reno v. Baird </em>(1998) 18 Cal.4th 640, 646 [76 Cal.Rptr.2d 499, 957 P.2d 1333]____) \u2018Thus, harassment focuses on situations in which the <em>social environment </em>of the workplace becomes intolerable because the harassment (whether verbal, physical, or visual) communicates an offensive message to the harassed employee.\u2019 <em>(Roby v. McKesson Corp. </em>(2009) 47 Cal.4th 686, 706 [101 Cal.Rptr.3d 773, 219 P.3d 749] . . . .)\u201d <em>(Rehmani v. Superior Court </em>(2012) 204 Cal.App.4th 945, 951 [139 Cal.Rptr.3d 464], original italics <em>(Rehmani).)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b743-9\">Harassment is distinguishable from discrimination under the FEHA. \u201c[Discrimination refers to bias in the exercise of official actions on behalf of the employer, and harassment refers to bias that is expressed or communicated through interpersonal relations in the workplace.\u201d <em>(Roby </em>v. <em>McKesson, Corp., supra, </em>47 Cal.4th 686, 707.) As our high court explained in <em>Reno v. Baird, </em>\u201cHarassment claims are based on a type of conduct that is avoidable and unnecessary to job performance. No supervisory employee needs to use slurs or derogatory drawings, to physically interfere with freedom of movement, to engage in unwanted sexual advances, etc., in order to carry out the legitimate objectives of personnel management. Every supervisory employee can insulate himself or herself from claims of harassment by refraining from such conduct. An individual supervisory employee cannot, however, refrain from engaging in the type of conduct which could later give rise to a discrimination claim. Making personnel decisions is an inherent and unavoidable part of the supervisory function.\u201d Without making personnel decisions, a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"870\">*870</page-number>supervisory employee simply cannot perform his or her job duties.\u201d <em>(Reno </em>v. <em>Baird, supra, </em>18 Cal.4th at p. 646, quoting <em>Janken v. GM Hughes Electronics </em>(1996) 46 Cal.App.4th 55, 63-65 [53 Cal.Rptr.2d 741] (Janken).)  The court explained further \u201cthat the Legislature intended that commonly necessary personnel management actions such as hiring and firing, job or project assignments, office or work station assignments, promotion or demotion, performance evaluations, the provision of support, the assignment or nonassignment of supervisory functions, deciding who will and who will not attend meetings, deciding who will be laid off, and the like, do not come within the meaning of harassment. These are actions of a type necessary to carry out the duties of business and personnel management. These actions may retrospectively be found discriminatory if based on improper motives, but in that event the remedies provided by the FEHA are those for discrimination, not harassment. Harassment, by contrast, consists of actions outside the scope of job duties which are not of a type necessary to business and personnel management.\u201d <em>(Reno v. Baird, </em>at pp. 646-647.)</p>\n<p id=\"b744-4\">\u201cWhether the conduct of the alleged harassers was sufficiently severe or pervasive to create a hostile or abusive working environment depends on the totality of the circumstances. \u2018 \u201cThese may include the frequency of the discriminatory conduct; its severity; whether it is physically threatening or humiliating, or a mere offensive utterance; and whether it unreasonably interferes with an employee\u2019s work performance.\u201d \u2019 [Citations.] ' \u201cCommon sense, and an appropriate sensibility to social context, will enable courts and juries to distinguish between simple teasing or roughhousing . . . and conduct [that] a reasonable person in the plaintiff\u2019s position would find severely hostile or abusive.\u201d \u2019 [Citations.] As in sex-based harassment claims, \u2018[t]he plaintiff must prove that the defendant\u2019s conduct would have interfered with a reasonable employee\u2019s [fn. omitted] work performance and would have seriously affected the psychological well-being of a reasonable employee and that [he or she] was actually offended.\u2019 [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Rehmani, supra, </em>204 Cal.App.4th at pp. 951-952.)</p>\n<p id=\"b744-6\">Seni contends the court erred in granting summary adjudication of her harassment claim because she produced evidence that McDonald falsely accused her of being a liar and untrustworthy, and that \u201cthey\u201d intimidated and humiliated her by insisting that Veit attend and take notes at Serri\u2019s regular meetings with McDonald. Without citation to evidence in the record, Serri argues that she \u201cwas the only [University] employee subjected to this type of humiliation\u201d and asserts that she was treated this way because she is Puerto Rican.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-7\">In support of their motions for summary adjudic\u00e1tion, both McDonald and Veit declared that they did not make any hostile or derogatory statements to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"871\">*871</page-number>or about Serri at their meetings and that they never made any derogatory references to her race, gender, ethnicity, or other protected status. Although Sera\u2019s separate statement stated that she \u201cdisputed\u201d these facts, none of the evidence she cited created a triable issue on the question whether McDonald or Veit ever made any derogatory remarks about Serri\u2019s national origin, age, or sex, or that they engaged in other conduct that constitutes harassment. Thus, the record is devoid of any evidence that McDonald and Veit engaged in harassing conduct of the type described in <em>Reno v. Baird </em>and <em>Janken. </em>The conduct Sera complains of involves McDonald\u2019s decisions about who would attend her meetings with Serri and how those meetings were conducted. As <em>Reno </em>v. <em>Baird </em>instructs, while these allegations may involve discrimination (a claim we have already concluded has no merit), they are not harassment. For these reasons, we hold that the court properly granted McDonald\u2019s and Veit\u2019s motions for summary adjudication of Serri\u2019s harassment claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-5\">As for her harassment claim against Father Locatelli, Serri argues that she produced evidence that Father \u201cLocatelli and his subordinates, made and approved of disparaging ethnic remarks about moving her office next to a taqueria[J . . . criticized her dress as looking like a poncho and criticized her hair as too curly.\u201d This is the full extent of her argument regarding this claim. As we have explained, to prevail on her harassment claim, Serri is required to produce evidence that she was subjected to offensive comments or other abusive conduct that was based on a protected characteristic (her national origin, age or sex) that was sufficiently severe or pervasive as to alter the conditions of her employment. In our view, Joe Sugg\u2019s remark in 2000 that there are \u201cnice places to eat around here\u201d and Father Locatelli\u2019s statements that he liked Serri\u2019s hairstyle better when she blew her curly hair dry because it looked more relaxed and professional and that her shawl looked like a poncho are not derogatory or offensive or the type of statements that \u201cwould have interfered with a reasonable employee\u2019s . . . work performance and would have seriously affected the psychological well-being of a reasonable employee.\u201d (Rehmani, <em>supra, </em>204 Cal.App.4th at pp. 951-952.) Moreover, these three comments, made over the course of six years, were not so pervasive as to support a claim for harassment. We conclude that the court did not err when it granted the University\u2019s and Father Locatelli\u2019s motion for summary adjudication of Serri\u2019s harassment claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-6\">G. <em>Third Cause of Action: The Trial Court Properly Granted Summary Adjudication of Serri\u2019s Equal Pay Act Claim</em><footnotemark><em>*</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b746-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"872\">*872</page-number>H. <em>Fourth and Fifth Causes of Action: The Trial Court Properly Granted-Summary Adjudication of Serri\u2019s Breach of Contract and Bad Faith Claims</em></p>\n<p id=\"b746-4\">Serri\u2019s fourth cause of action for breach of contract alleged that she was not an at-will employee and that her employment contract with the University was \u201cpartially oral, partially written in the form of [the University\u2019s] Staff Policy Manual.\u201d Serri alleged that her employment contract contained promises that she would not be discharged except for good cause and that she would be afforded progressive discipline or remediation if there were problems with her job performance. She alleged that the University breached her employment contract when it terminated her without good cause and without an opportunity to correct any improper conduct. Serri\u2019s fifth cause of action alleged that the University breached the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing in her employment contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-5\">The University\u2019s policy 310 sets forth the University\u2019s policies and procedures regarding \u201cCorrective Action for Performance Problems\u201d and outlines the steps to be taken when performance problems arise. It also provides: \u201cIn some circumstances the problem is so serious that extraordinary measures other than typical corrective action may need to be taken. Examples of such problems include gross misconduct .... Examples of extraordinary measures include suspension, and/or termination, [f] If the corrective action is unsuccessful or the problem is so severe as to render corrective action inappropriate or impractical, termination of employment can occur.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b746-6\">In granting summary adjudication of the fourth and fifth causes of actions, the trial court found that the contract permitted termination without an opportunity for corrective action, that the University had good cause to terminate Serri, and that Serri failed to raise a triable issue whether the University acted in good faith or that its reasons for firing her were arbitrary or capricious.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-7\">\u201cGood cause\u201d in the context of implied employment contracts is defined as: \u201cfair and honest reasons, regulated by good faith on the part of the employer, that are not trivial, arbitrary or capricious, unrelated to business needs or goals, or pretextual. A reasoned conclusion, in short, supported by substantial evidence, gathered through an adequate investigation that includes notice of the claimed misconduct and a chance for the employee to respond.\u201d <em>(Cotran </em>v. <em>Rollins Hudig Hall Internal, Inc. </em>(1998) 17 Cal.4th 93, 107-108 [69 Cal.Rptr.2d 900, 948 P.2d 412] <em>(Cotran).) </em>\u201cThree factual determinations are relevant to the question of employer liability: (1) did the employer act with good faith in making the decision to terminate; (2) did the decision follow an investigation that was appropriate under the circumstances; and (3) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"873\">*873</page-number>did the employer have reasonable grounds for believing the employee had engaged in the misconduct.\u201d <em>(Silva v.

Although the elements of the <em>Cotran </em>standard are triable to the jury, \u201cif the facts are undisputed or admit of only one conclusion, then summary judgment may be entered . . . .\u201d <em>(Silva, supra, </em>65 Cal.App.4th at p. 264.)</p>\n<p id=\"b747-6\">Send argues that the University did not have good cause to terminate her because it prevented her from preparing the AAP\u2019s. She asserts that she did not commit \u201cgross misconduct\u201d and that she presented evidence that preparing the AAP was a minor job duty, that failure to prepare a fully compliant AAP was not significant and would not result in any harm to the University, and that the problem was easily correctable by providing her with an AAP consultant. She also contends the University must not have considered her acts to be gross misconduct, since it did not fire her right away, and that it acted arbitrarily by firing her for a relatively insignificant failure that resulted in no harm.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-7\">Undisputed facts established that Serri\u2019s job duties included preparing the annual AAP and that she did not prepare the narrative portion of the AAP (the part that Serri, as opposed to her assistant, was charged with preparing) for three years. Serri also told the University that the draft AAP\u2019s she presented were indefensible and that the University was likely to be audited by the OFCCP.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-8\">Although Serri does not address this point in her opening brief, the University\u2019s termination letter stated three reasons for her termination: (1) failing to prepare the AAP for three years; (2) failing to disclose the problem to her supervisors; and (3) making misrepresentations related to the AAP\u2019s. The University argues that the third reason alone constituted \u201cgood cause\u201d to terminate Serri\u2019s employment. It asserts: \u201cLack of forthrightness and dishonesty are not deficiencies in skill or ability that may be improved by corrective action or additional training. . . . These are matters of integrity and trustworthiness.\u201d The University relies on the following language from <em>Cotran: </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"874\">*874</page-number>\u201c \u2018Care must be taken, however,\u2019 . . . \u2018not to interfere with the legitimate exercise of managerial discretion. . . . [Citation.] And where ... the employee occupies a sensitive managerial or confidential position, the employer must of necessity be allowed substantial scope for the exercise of subjective judgment.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Cotran, supra, </em>17 Cal.4th at p. 100.) In <em>Cotran, </em>our high court also stated, \u201c \u2018[A]n employer must have wide latitude in making independent, good faith judgments about high-ranking employees without the threat of a jury second-guessing its business judgment. Measuring the effective performance of such an employee involves the consideration of many intangible attributes such as personality, initiative, ability to function as part of the management team and to motivate subordinates, and the ability to conceptualize and effectuate management style and goals.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 100-101.) The University argues that even if Serri\u2019s failure to prepare the AAP\u2019s could be corrected by hiring a consultant, that would not change the fact that Serri concealed her failure from the University, and that other University employees certified the existence of AAP\u2019s Serri had not prepared. Dodson\u2019s e-mail from September 2004, which Serri received, illustrates the concern. He stated, \u201cAs the person who has to sign compliance assurances for federal grants, I am not willing to lie.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b748-4\">Based on all of the admissible evidence in this case, we conclude that the University met its burden of establishing that it acted in good faith and had reasonable grounds for believing Serri engaged in gross misconduct when it decided to terminate her and that its decision was based on \u201cfair and honest reasons.\u201d It cannot be reasonably asserted that termination for misrepresenting the status of an important report that impacted the work of other University departments was \u201ctrivial, arbitrary or capricious\u201d or unrelated to the University\u2019s business needs or goals. <em>(Cotran, supra, </em>17 Cal.4th at pp. 107-108.) And as we have already held, the University has established that its reasons for terminating Serri were not pretextual, and Serri has failed to raise a triable issue on that point.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-5\">As summarized above, Serri argues that her failure to prepare complete AAP\u2019s for three years was not gross misconduct, the type of conduct that would be grounds for termination without corrective action under her contract. But even if Serri\u2019s evidence created a triable issue with regard to the question whether the failure to prepare AAP\u2019s for three years was gross misconduct, it does not create a triable issue on the question whether she misrepresented the existence of the AAP\u2019s to her supervisors and other employees at the University. When Father Locatelli asked Serri to bring the AAP\u2019s for the last 10 years to their October 13, 2006 meeting, she wrote in an e-mail that she was working on the current Plan, promised to bring her draft and the previous year\u2019s Plan, and implied that prior AAP\u2019s had been destroyed in accordance with industry standards. In fact, there was no Plan for the previous year. It was undisputed that Serri created the two draft Plans <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"875\">*875</page-number>she presented at the meeting the night before the meeting. And the record demonstrates that the Plans for prior years had not been destroyed; Serri\u2019s own evidence includes a copy of the AAP for August 2002 through August 2003. In addition, Campbell declared that she talked to Serri two or three times a year about the AAP certifications and that Serri never told her the University did not have an AAP. In September 2006, when Campbell asked Serri whether they could release a copy of the AAP to the City of San Jos\u00e9, rather than tell Campbell there was no current AAP, Serri said the University did not release it. Serri also offered to send Campbell a \u201csanitized version\u201d of the AAP, which Serri testified meant the narrative summary, even though there was no narrative summary at that point in time. In summary, even if Serri\u2019s evidence created a triable issue on the question whether the failure to prepare the AAP\u2019s was gross misconduct, it did not create a triable issue on the question whether she made misrepresentations regarding the AAP\u2019s, which ground was sufficient by itself to demonstrate gross misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-5\">As for Serri\u2019s contention that the timing of her termination demonstrates that she did not commit gross misconduct, although Warren was concerned about Serri\u2019s misconduct in October 2006, he decided to wait until after the investigations of her Policy 311 claims were completed before deciding what to do. Independent investigator Fredkin completed the investigation of Serri\u2019s second claim in January 2007;<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Serri appealed his findings, which were affirmed by the Board on February 13, 2007. Serri was thereafter terminated in March 7, 2007. In our view, this sequence of events does not support Serri\u2019s contention. We conclude that the court properly granted summary adjudication of Serri\u2019s breach of contract claim. In addition, Serri\u2019s breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing claim falls within her breach of contract claim. <em>(Guz, supra, </em>24 Cal.4th at p. 350 [\u201cif the employer\u2019s termination decisions ... do not breach ... a substantive contract provision, they are not precluded by the covenant\u201d].) Serri does not contend otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-6\">I.-K.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b750-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"876\">*876</page-number>L. <em>The Trial Court Properly Granted Summary Judgment</em></p>\n<p id=\"b750-4\">Since the court properly granted summary adjudication of each of Serri\u2019s causes of action, it properly granted summary judgment in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-5\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b750-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-7\">Rushing, P.

A party that objects to evidence presented on a motion for summary judgment must either timely file separate written objections or object orally at the hearing. <em>(Reid </em>v. <em>Google, Inc. </em>(2010) 50 Cal.4th 512, 531-532 [113 Cal.Rptr.3d 327, 235 P.3d 988] <em>(Reid), </em>citing \u00a7 437c, subds.

But neither section 437c nor the California Rules of Court require a party to file written opposition to the opposing party\u2019s objections or risk waiver. (See <em>Greenspan v. LADT LLC </em>(2010) 191 Cal.App.4th 486, 526 [121 Cal.Rptr.3d 118] [no authority suggests that responses to the objections must be made in the trial court to preserve a challenge to the trial court\u2019s rulings on appeal].)

However, <em>Nazir </em>was decided before <em>Reid. </em>In <em>Reid, </em>the Supreme Court addressed the effect of a trial court\u2019s failure to rule on evidentiary objections in a motion for summary judgment and held, \u201cIf the trial court fails to rule after a party has properly objected, the evidentiary objections are not deemed waived on appeal.\u201d <em>(Reid, supra, </em>50 Cal.4th at p. 517.)

In our view, this case is distinguishable from <em>Cheal. </em>The discharged employee in <em>Cheal </em>was terminated for making several errors in the preparation of patient meals. In opposition to the employer\u2019s motion, the employee presented evidence that, given the nature of the work, the hospital expected mistakes; that her mistakes did not exceed the standards the hospital had set for acceptable performance; and that other employees were not disciplined for making the same types of mistakes. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 740-754.) The employee also presented evidence of discriminatory animus by her supervisor based on the supervisor\u2019s statement to a former friend that she favored younger workers. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 754-761.) Unlike the employee in <em>Cheal, </em>who did her assigned tasks but arguably made mistakes within an acceptable range of performance, Serri <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"866\">*866</page-number>did not perform an important function of her position for three years and then misrepresented the existence of certain AAP\u2019s to Father Locatelli and other University personnel.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b740-7\"> Serri argues that she was the only high-ranking Puerto Rican or Latina staff member at the University.

In her opposition to the motions, however, she relied on it to prove the truth of the matter asserted therein, not her state of mind. She also asserted that it was admissible under exceptions to the hearsay rule for past recollection recorded, as a prior consistent statement, a business record, and under the publication exception for historical works, books of science or art, maps and charts (Evid.
