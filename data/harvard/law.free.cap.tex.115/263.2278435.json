The cause was submitted to a jmy and resulted in a verdict for appellant for $735.00, and he, not being satisfied therewith, appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-5\">\u201cAppellant owned about 1,100 acres of land in one tract, a part of wihich lies contiguous to the levee.i constructed by appellees. Appellant claimed that by reason of the change made in Richland and Chambers Creeks by the building of the levee, appellees took a small portion of his land and caused water to flow over the remainder thereof, and that by reason thereof 350 acres of his land had been rendered useless and the rental value of the remainder had been damaged $5.00 per acre per annum, and that the value of the remainder of the land had been diminished $20.00 per acre. He claimed that by the building of the levee he had lost his pasturage and part of his cotton crops for the years 1921 and 1922.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-6\">\u201cThe cause was submitted in the trial court on special issues and instructions, some of them being given at the request of the parties.

That as applied to the uncultivated land, the term \u201creasonable rental value\u201d means the amount of money that said land would have rented for pasture purposes during said years.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-5\">\u201c \u2018(e) You are instructed that the burden of proof is on the plaintiff, B.

But the law you will receive from the Court, in the charges giv\u00e9h you, and be governed thereby.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-7\">\u201c \u2018You will not resort to lot or chance in arriving at your verdict. The form of your verdict you will find below, which must be signed by your foreman.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b290-8\">\u201cSPECIAL CHARGE AND INSTRUCTION NO. 3 GIVEN BY TRIAL COURT AT REQUEST OF DEFENDANT.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-9\">\u201c \u2018Gentlemen of the Jury:</p>\n<p id=\"b290-10\">\u201c \u2018If you believe from the evidence that defendants\u2019 act in cutting said channel or placing said spoil bank or constructing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>said levee was a source of injury or damage to plaintiff\u2019s lands or crops, or grass, but also believe from the evidence that plaintiff\u2019s crops or grass or land would have be\u00e9n damaged, independent of any effect of the cutting of said channel or the placing of said spoil bank or the construction of said levee, and if you cannot distinguish between the damage caused plaintiff by the general overflow and the damage caused by water, if any, cast upon plaintiff\u2019s crops, pasture or grass or lands by reason of cutting said channel or placing said spoil bank or constructing said levees, you must find for the defendant on these issues, and if you so believe you will answer Questions Nos. 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, and 15 against said plaintiff. And the burden is upon plaintiff to show by a preponderance of evidence that his crops, grass or lands were damaged by reason of the cutting of said channel, the placing of said spoil bank or the construction of said levee.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b291-5\">\u201cSPECIAL CHARGE AND INSTRUCTION NO. 1 GIVEN BY TRIAL COURT AT REQUEST OF PLAINTIFF.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-6\">\u201c 'Gentlemen of the Jury:</p>\n<p id=\"b291-7\">\u201c \u2018You are instructed in connection with Questions Nos. 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9 as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b291-8\">\u201c \u2018In considering the damages to the land, if any, you will find (1) the market value of the land before the levee construction began; and (2) you will find the value of the land after the completion of the levee improvements. And in this connection you will take into consideration all evidence and facts relating to damages to said land, if any, sustained during the levee construction, since its completion to this time, and the reasonable and probable damages which it will sustain hereafter resulting from the overflow of water upon plaintiff\u2019s said land resulting from said levee construction.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b291-9\">\u201cAppellant objected to the submission of the Special Charge and Instruction No. 3 given by the court at the request of appellees, because: (1) it does not state the law applicable to the facts; (2) it is confusing when applied to the several questions submitted to the jury; (3) it unduly emphasizes that the burden of proof is upon the plaintiff to show by a preponderance of the evidence his right to recover; (4) because said special charge amounts to a general instruction on the case whereas the court had submitted the cause upon special issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-11\">\u201cAppellant objected to the court\u2019s charge as a whole, together with the special charges and explanatory instructions, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>because it unduly emphasized that the burden of proof was upon , plaintiff to prove the facts entitling him to recover.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-3\">\u201cThe evidence in this case shows that appellant\u2019s land had been subject to overflow for a long number of years prior to the construction of the levee, and there was some evidence tending to show that the overflow waters had been higher on appellant\u2019s land before the levee was constructed than thereafter, and that the high water in 1922, which appellant claims did the greatest amount of damage, was higher than it had ever been in the history of the country, and that all the damage to appellant\u2019s land that was done would have been done regardless of the fact that such levee improvements had been constructed. The issues submitted by the court were all raised by the testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-4\">\u201cAt a former day of this term we reversed the judgment of the trial court, on the ground that the Special Charge and Instruction No. 3, requested by appellees and given by the court, should not have been given, and we sustained appellant\u2019s contention that the court\u2019s charge, with its explanatory instructions, did unduly and unlawfully emphasize that the burden of proof was upon appellant to prove the facts entitling him to recover. A motion for a rehearing is pending in this court, and there being some doubt in our minds as to the soundness of our holdings on the above questions, and by reason of an apparent conflict in our holdings with the Court of Civil Appeals for the Third District, in the case of Fort Worth &amp; D. C. Ry. Co. v. Speer, 212 S. W., 762, we deem it proper to certify certain questions to the Supreme Court before passing upon the motion for a rehearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-5\">\u201cWe respectfully submit to the Honorable Supreme Court of this state for its determination upon the facts hereinbefore set out, the following questions:</p>\n<p id=\"b292-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-7\">\u201cWere we in error in holding that the court\u2019s charge, taken in connection with the explanatory instructions, unduly and unlawfully emphasized that the burden of proof was upon appellant to prove the facts entitling him to recover ?</p>\n<p id=\"b292-8\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-9\">\u201cThere being evidence in this case tending to show that a part of the damage complained of by the plaintiff would have been suffered from overflow waters if the levee improvements in question had never been constructed, and that a part of such damage <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>resulted from additional waters caused to flow onto or over plaintiff\u2019s land by such levee improvements so constructed, was it proper for the court to instruct the jury, in substance, that if they could not distinguish between the damage caused by the general overflow and the damage caused by water cast upon plaintiff\u2019s land by reason of such levee improvements, they should answer all questions pertaining to damages against the plaintiff ?</p>\n<p id=\"b293-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-6\">\u201cWere we in error in holding that the trial court committed error in giving appellees\u2019 Special Instruction No. 3 ?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b293-7\">The measure of damages for permanent injury to the land is the difference in the market value just prior to the time of the levee improvements and immediately subsequent to such improvements. This damage arises from the fact that the land will be subjected to overflow by reason of the improvements, and suit could be filed and recovery had even prior to any actual overflow. The amount of the reduction in the value of the land caused by the improvements made would not depend solely upon the extent of the overflow between the time the improvements were begun and the time of the trial of the case. So, if from the evidence in this case, the jury believed that the land had been damaged on account of the water which was caused to flow thereon by reason of the improvements, the amounts of recovery would depend on proof of market value, and not on whether they could distinguish between the damages caused by the improvements by reason of water cast upon the land thereby, and that which would have resulted from overflow had the levee improvements not been constructed.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-8\">We think the charge is erroneous for-the reason that it is misleading. The inability to distinguish from the evidence the exact amount of the damages caused by reason of the construction of the levee improvements from that which would have been sustained had such improvements not been constructed would not furnish a sufficient reason to deny a recovery. It is only where under the evidence the amount of recovery is wholly left to speculation and conjecture that recovery will be denied. If, from a preponderance of the evidence, the jury believes that the plaintiff has been damaged as alleged in his petition, the amount must be left to their reasonable discretion, and the court is not warranted in prescribing any fixed rule as is attempted in this charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-9\">It is only when it is necessary to enable the jury to properly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>pass upon and render a verdict on the issues submitted that the court is by statute required to submit explanations in regard to special issues. If the issues submitted are such that explanations are not necessary, none should be given. The issues to which this special charge was by its terms made applicable required no explanation to enable the jury to pass upon and render verdict thereon.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-3\">The expression \u201cif you cannot distinguish between the damages\u201d may have\u2018been construed by the jury to mean that if the exact proportion of the damages caused by the levee improvements was not under the evidence made certain to the extent that same was susceptible of mathematical calculation, no finding of damages was warranted. We do not think a charge subject to this construction is the law. It is only where the state of the evidence is such that the amount of damages resulting from the levee improvements is left wholly to speculation and conjecture, and for this reason are not distinguishable from the damages which would have otherwise resulted, that the jury is precluded from rendering a verdict assessing damages. If, from the evidence, the amount of the damages could be reasonably inferred, the question of damages is one for the jury, and a charge which might lead the jury to believe otherwise is erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-4\">Article 1985, Revised Civil Statutes 1911, provides that: \u201cIt shall be the duty of the court, when it submits a case to the jury upon special issues, to submit all the issues made by the pleadings.\u201d Article 1984a, Vernon\u2019s Sayles\u2019 Texas Civil Statutes 1914, Acts 1913, p. 113, Sec. 1, provides that: \u201cSuch special issues shall be submitted distinctly and separately, and without being intermingled with each other, so that each issue may be answered by the jury separately.\u201d The issues as to whether plaintiff\u2019s crops or grass or land would have been damaged independently of any effect of the construction of the levee improvements, though facts in issue under the pleadings, were not submitted so that each issue could be answered separately as required, but were intermingled. By this special charge no specific answer was required to either of these issues, but the jury were instructed that if they believed the land or crops or grass would have been damaged independently of the effect of the construction of the levee improvements, and could not distinguish between the damage so caused, and that caused by the levee improvements, they should make such answer to the special issues relating to damages as would in law defeat a recovery. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>This charge was given in violation of the statutory requirements above quoted. It is a general charge on the law arising on the facts, and for this reason should not have been given in a case submitted on special issues. It directs the jury to apply the law to the facts in making answer to special issues, whereas it was the duty of the court to ascertain from the jury the facts established by the evidence, and then apply the law to the established facts. Connellee v. Neese, 266 S. W., 502; Anderson &amp; Co. v. Reich, 260 S. W., 162; Worden v. Kroeger, 219 S. W., 1094; Ry. Co. v. Harrington, 235 S. W., 188.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-3\">In this special charge, as well as in the charge given in connection with issue No. 3, and that given in connection with issues Nos. 10,11,12,13, 14, and 15, the court repeatedly instructed the jury that the burden of proof was on the plaintiff to show the facts which would entitle him to a favorable answer. Undue prominence was given the burden resting upon the plaintiff. We think the effect of these charges was to cast a doubt or suspicion upon the evidence bearing upon the damages sustained as a result of the levee improvements. - These instructions were calculated to impress the jury with the idea that there was some doubt in the mind of the judge of the court as to whether the evidence would sustain answers favorable to the plaintiff. Dallas Waste Mills v. Texas Cake &amp; Linter Co., 228 S. W., 118.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-4\">We think the questions certified should all be answered in the negative.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-5\">The opinion of the Commission of Appeals answering certified questions is adopted and ordered certified to the Court of Civil Appeals. <em>C.
