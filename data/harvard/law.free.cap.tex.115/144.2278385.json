Morrison, </em>for plaintiff in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b166-12\">On the proposition that a warranty on the part of the assured or a condition for defeating the policy prior to and independent of the Statute of 1909, (Arts. 4953, 4955, Rev.

There is no contention that it was not in all other respects a substantial copy of the original application. Under the circumstances, the absence of the signature becomes immaterial. Baggett having offered in evidence all of the policy except the application, the whole was admissible when offered by the Insurance Company. The Court of Civil Appeals having made a correct disposition of the case, the writ of error is refused.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
