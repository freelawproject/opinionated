The right to establish such a trust in property arises from the right of contract and from the right of one capable of making a contract to make such disposition of the legal title of his property as he pleases. Implied recognition of their validity as trust estates was given by the Court of Civil Appeals for the Seventh District in 1920 in the case of Bingham v. Graham, 220 S. W., 105; and express recognition by the Court of Civil Appeals for the Fifth District in the same year in the case <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>of Davis v. Hudgins, 225 S. W., 73, and later by the Court of Civil Appeals for the Eighth District in the case of Cotton States Petroleum Co. v. Britton, 230 S. W., 742, and by this court in Houston Oil Co. v. Village Mills Co., 241 S. W., 122; Cox v. Hickman, 8 H. L. C., 268, 9 C. B., 47; Smith v. Anderson, 15 Ch. Div., 247-285. Massachusetts cases: Mayo v. Morris, 151 Mass., 481; Williams v.

The Fort Worth Court of Civil Appeals reversed the judgment of the District Court, and rendered judgment for defendant in error against plaintiffs in error as well as against the Hollister Oil Company. 241 S. W., 700.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-7\">The conclusions reached by the Court of Civil Appeals in an admirable opinion of Judge Dunklin are in harmony with our disposition today of similar questions in the case of Thompson v. Schmitt, 115 Texas, 53. Under the rules announced in that case, plaintiffs in error are liable as partners for debts of the Hollister Oil Company including the debt to defendant in error.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-8\">One ground of the decision of the Court of Civil Appeals, not involved in the case of Thompson v. Schmitt, was that the articles of association conferred such control on the shareholders over the company and its business as to prevent a decision that the articles of association created a trust under the refined rule which it would seem would be applied in Massachusetts. In this view, we also concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-9\">The vitally important power to increase the capital with which the business was to be done was dependent on express authorization of a majority of the stockholders. The trustees were empowered to do any act necessary or proper to effect the purposes specified either in the declaration of trust or in any amendments thereof, and the shareholders by majority vote, could alter or amend the declaration of trust. The trustees were therefore certainly subject to the control of the certificate holders, and under the decisions of the -Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts the company would be regarded as partnership. Neville v. Gifford, 242 Mass., 127, 136 N. E., 160; Frost v. Thompson, 219 Mass., 365, 366, 106 N. E., 1009; Morehead v. Greenville Ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>change National Bank, 243 S. W., 546; Feldman v. American Dist. Telegraph Co., 257 S. W., 930.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-5\">The argument for \"plaintiffs in error reflects much zeal and marked ability. All the points presented are disposed of by the opinion in the Thompson v. Schmitt case.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-6\">The judgment of the Court of Civil Appeals is in all things affirmed.,</p>\n<p id=\"b75-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
