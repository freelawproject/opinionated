In this case the law gives them no discretion, they must use the property for school purposes. \u25a0 That being true, the District Court has jurisdiction.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b168-3\">Per Curiam :</author>\n<p id=\"AKc\">While we do not doubt the jurisdiction of the District Court over a suit to prevent the improper use of school property, yet since the petition in this case failed to disclose an abuse of discretion on the part of the Trustees such as to give a cause of action to a private citizen, we refuse the application for the writ of error.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
