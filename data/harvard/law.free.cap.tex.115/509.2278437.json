Withers v. Patterson, 27 Texas, 495; Templeton v. Ferguson, 89 Texas, 47.</p>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b532-11\">It appearing that the decree entered December 28, 1925, is void and that its enforcement will constitute a mere \u201cfishing excursion\u201d on the part of defendants in error in that its purposes and effects are to enable defendants in error to ascertain whether they have a cause of action, to ascertain the evidence on which plaintiff in error bases its defense and the names of its witnesses, to prove matters within the knowledge of defendants in error, or of which they have equal means of knowledge, to extort trade and business secrets from plaintiff in error, to require plaintiff in error to produce incompetent, immaterial and hearsay testimony, which defendants in error <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>could not use at the trial and have no intention of using at the trial, to harass,, annoy and vex plaintiff in error, to require plaintiff in error to divulge confidential and privileged communications, and that the enforcement of said decree will result in serious injury to plaintiff in error for which it has no adequate remedy at law, it follows that a cause of equitable cognizance is presented requiring relief as prayed by plaintiff in error.

It is a well established rule that an injunction will not be granted to stay proceedings in the same court of equity either upon the application of parties to the proceedings sought to be enjoined or of others. High on Injunctions (4th Ed.), Vol. 1, Sec. 52. The refusal of the trial judge to grant the injunction was therefore in accordance with the established principles of equity.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
