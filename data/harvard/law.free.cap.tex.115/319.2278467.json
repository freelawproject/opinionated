Vernon\u2019s Sayles\u2019 Annotated Civil Statutes, 1914, Articles 7796 to 7818 inclusive; Newby v. W. T. Rawleigh Co., 194 S. W., 1173; Whisenent v. Shores-Mueller Co., 194 S. W., 1175; Caddall v.

Watkins Med. Co., 227 S. W., 239; Fuqua, Hinkle &amp; Davis v. Pabst Brewing Co., 90 Texas, 302.</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b345-6\">Under the plain terms of the printed contract there is in the hands of the appellant the absolute power to dictate by a mere suggestion. In other words, with the above provisions which give the appellant company the power to curtail the amount of goods delivered, and to terminate the contract at any time, whereby all of the indebtedness then accrued under such contract would become immediately due and payable, we contend that such provisions make letters, papers, communications, or instructions of any kind sent by appellant to appellee as binding as though they were a part of the signed contract. If the appellee had not assented to and obeyed such instructions, he would have been coerced into such acquiescence.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b345-7\">It therefore follows that in order to ascertain the complete contract between the parties, under which the sale was after-wards made, we must look not only to the written contract, but also to the conditions imposed in the printed literature sent by appellant to Land and by the latter assented to and observed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b345-8\">Under the agreement between plaintiff and defendant there <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>was a complete and direct sale of the goods in question to the defendant by the plaintiff; and as a result of such sale, when the goods came into the hands of defendant and were broken from their original packages and offered for sale, they lost their character of interstate commerce and therefore became subject to the Anti-Trust Act of Texas.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b346-3\">The contract in this case is absolutely void under the AntiTrust Act of Texas, and could not have been under any circumstances ratified by appellee Land.

T. Rawleigh Company, an Illinois corporation, against B. B. Land, as principal, and G. W. Skinner, G. R. Bobo and J. T. Graham, as guarantors, in the District Court of Fannin County, on the-day of---, 1923, to recover a debt alleged to have been provided for in the instruments to be considered. The defendants alleged that an agreement existed between the company, on the one hand, and the remaining defendants, on the other, of such nature as to be in violation of the state anti-trust laws, thus rendering the contract unenforceable.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-9\">The jury in response to a special issue found that Land was restricted to defined territory in making sales of his goods. Thereupon judgment was rendered for the defendants. This judgment was first reversed and rendered, and then, upon rehearing, was affirmed by the Court of Civil Appeals for the Sixth District. 261 S. W. 186.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-10\">The case is in the Supreme Court on questions involving the legality of the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-11\">OPINION.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-12\">1. The paper contemporaneously with which relations between Land and the Company began (quoted in full in 261 S. W., 186), contains ten numbered paragraphs. The first is merely formal. The last declares no agreement is made except that contained in the instrument, etc. The remaining parts naturally fall into one or the other of two groups, and they will be considered in that order.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-13\">(a) Paragraphs two and three state Land\u2019s desire to purchase, \u201cat wholesale\u201d and the company\u2019s \u201cagreement to sell,\u201d f. o.. b. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>Memphis, Tenn, or Freeport, 111, or \u201cat any other point agreed upon,\u201d \u201csuch of its manufactured products as the seller shall hereafter determine to sell to said buyer\u201d at then \u201ccurrent wholesale prices,\u201d the \u201ckind and quantity of which is to be optional with the said seller.\u201d According to Paragraph Five, \u201cthe seller will at its option also sell to the buyer a wagon,\u201d etc, \u201cfor cash\u201d or on credit. If the \u201cbuyer\u201d so purchases, then, per the terms of Paragraph Four, he \u201cagrees to pay the seller the invoice price.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b347-5\">In Paragraph 6 it is provided that either party may, at any time * * * by written notice, terminate this agreement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b347-6\">Paragraph Eight evidences \u201cagreement\u201d of the Company to buy back from Land such goods as \u201che may have on hand\u201d if Land returns them during or immediately after \u201cthe life of the contract.\u201d As context of the other paragraphs this \u201cagreement\u201d is purely contingent upon the will of either party, for Land could have no goods \u201con hand\u201d unless the Company first agrees to sell and Land agrees to buy.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-7\">In respect to purchases of goods, etc, the foregoing includes all of the supposed \u201cagreements\u201d and \u201cobligations\u201d of the \u201ccontract.\u201d Those provisions, obviously, mean only this: If, in the future, Land desires to purchase something from the Company, and <em>then </em>orders it, the Company will <em>then </em>determine whether it desires to sell <em>anything </em>to Land; \u25a0 if it decides to sell him <em>something, </em>it will <em>then </em>decide the \u201ckind and quantity\u201d of what it cares to sell, and the price and whether \u201cfor cash\u201d or on credit; if Land then still desires to purchase that \u201ckind and quantity\u201d at that price and on those terms, he may do so, provided the Company does not change its mind at the last moment.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-8\">Thus far, the paper is paper \u2014 and nothing more. No obligation to sell anything at any time or on any terms \u2014 or to do anything else \u2014 is laid upon the Company, nor is Land bound to buy at all, or to do anything whatever. No right is created and no obligation is declared. The parties are left exactly where they were before. Neither is required to move except at his own will. Hence, there is no contract here.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-9\">\u201cIt is nothing more than a contract to enter into a contract, in the future, if the parties can then agree to contract.\u201d Weegham v. Killifer, 215 Fed., 170. And no right of action can be predicated on it. Williams v. Phelps, Civ. App., 171 S. W., 1100; Hume v. Bogle, Civ. App., 204 S. W., 673; Bean v. Holmes, 236 S.

It indicates use of language to conceal thought. And this, in turn, invites close scrutiny of what is left of the paper.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-4\">(b) Paragraph seven declares that \u201cif dealings conducted hereunder are mutually agreeable,\u201d a \u201cnew contract\u201d may be made for the next year. This, of course, is wholly without sense, if considered as an attempt to define a right or obligation; but, as a threat and warning of what will happen unless Land conducts himself \u201cagreeably\u201d and \u201csatisfactorily\u201d it has a measure of reason. Its prophetic application is to things next appearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-5\">The balance of the instrument (with an exception to be noted) is in paragraph nine, which reads thus:</p>\n<p id=\"b348-6\">\u201cIt is mutually understood that the seller will furnish the buyer, from time to time, with educational salesmanship literature consisting of Rawleigh\u2019s Weekly, Guide Book, and other booklets, bulletins, leaflets, and letters of advice and suggestions, for the sole purpose of aiding and assisting buyer in making sales and collections; but it is expressly agreed that nothing contained in any of the aforesaid literature, letters, booklets, bulletins, leaflets, etc., shall be taken in any wise to alter, modify, change, or affect this, agreement, and shall only be considered as educational and advisory; and it is further expressly understood and agreed that any advice or suggestions contained therein is not to be considered by the buyer as orders, directions or instructions, nor in any way binding on him; it being mutually and fully understood and agreed that the said buyer is not, nor never has been, an agent or representative of the seller, but in business strictly for theirself.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b348-7\">Here is an expressed promise by the Company to furnish \u201ceducational salesmanship literature\u201d to Land, \u201cfrom time to time,\u201d and a plainly implied promise by Land to receive the \u201cliterature\u201d and ponder its \u201cadvice and suggestions\u201d in connection with his resale business. To this mutual agreement is coupled the proviso, that \u201cadvice and suggestions\u201d are not to be considered as binding on Land. The proviso, of course, is without meaning, except as a self-serving declaration of intent whose prima facie evidential value, if any, is greatly diminished by the patent efforts at concealment and wholly destroyed (or rather turned <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>against the the parties) if, in fact, a bad purpose appears in the execution of the agreement. We say it is otherwise meaningless, because Land was not at all obligated to buy, nor was the Company bound to sell; consequently, the \u201cliterature\u201d could have no present \u201cbinding\u201d effect as against his will.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-5\">The declared purpose of the agreement to furnish, receive and consider the \u201cliterature\u201d is to \u201caid and assist\u201d Land in making sales, etc., of such goods as he may have bought of the Company.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-6\">If the communication advised or suggested the doing or omission of acts by Land, and, thereupon, or by reason thereof, he decided to do those acts, an agreement between him and the Company was accomplished. The Company says to Land: \u201cWe are mutually interested in the success of your business; we agreed long ago that it was our right and duty to advise you, and make suggestions, so as to aid and assist you in making sales; hence, we believe you will make more or better sales and thereby make more money for all of us, if you will do thus and so, and we, therefore, in virtue of our right, duty and interest, advise and suggest you do that thing.\u201d Land desires to stay in business. The Company, in virtue of law, has the right (which it also declared in words) to terminate relations at will, and of this, right Land has knowledge. He remembers, also, the Company has already said that unless he shall be \u201cagreeable\u201d and his dealings \u201csatisfactory\u201d it will have no business with him next year. He thinks, also, that the method proposed will, if adopted, redound in profit. He readily contributes (by word and act) new acceptance of the proposition embraced in the suggestion as it was contemplated he would do. What was mutually intended (thus agreed to) ab initio sequently appears in practically interpretative conduct. State v. Racine Sattley Co., Civ. App. 134 S. W., 400, 404; State v. Livestock Exchange, 211 Mo. 181, 109 S. W., 677, 124 Am. St., 776. Thereupon perfection of the arrangement (contemplated and provided for in future in the instrument) is wrought.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-7\">If the subject-matter and object are lawful, an enforceable contract is made. If the purpose be unlawful, it prevents enforcibility of the obligation, but it does not remove or terminate the agreement (combination) itself. The true purpose, as well as details of its achievement, not being clearly or fully defined in the writing, they are supplied extrinsically by proof of what the parties said and did in its execution, despite what the paper says about the all-comprehensiveness of its provisions. The instrument employs the most general of terms and words of doubtful import. What \u201cadvice\u201d \u2014 what \u201csuggestions\u201d \u2014 are to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>be given are not defined except by reference to \u201ceducational salesmanship literature\u201d to be furnished, but whose text is not' given. Nor is there an eifort made at working out the exact boundaries of the proposed \u201caid\u201d and \u201cassistance.\u201d The true and exact sense in which the terms were used by the parties is, therefore, undisclosed \u2014 as written, their meaning is indefinite and ambiguous. And, therefore, proper subject to proof aliunde. Whisenant v. Shores-Mueller Co. Civ. App., 194 S. W., 1177, and cases there cited; Dewees v. Lockhart, 1 Texas, 535, 538; Franklin v.

W., 733; 9 Cyc., 588-9.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-4\">As to the instrument signed by Land in 1917, and renewed in 1918, 1919, 1920, and 1921 (with the exception to be noted) we conclude: First \u2014 Except for, and as provided in, paragraphs seven and nine it did not amount to an agreement. Second \u2014 It did, in paragraphs seven and nine, contain an executory agreement, which became complete and executed by acts of the parties. Third \u2014 As so made and consummated, the jury\u2019s finding is conclusive of its unlawful original (and continuing) purpose, which purpose, thus intended and achieved, was in violation of Articles 7796, 7798, 7799, and 7807, R. S. 1911, and Article 1466, Penal Code. Segall v. McCall Co., 108 Texas, 55, 184 S. W., 188; Fuqua v. Brewing Co., 90 Texas, 298, 38 S. W., 479, 29, 750; T. &amp; P. Coal Co. v. Lawson, 89 Texas, 394, 34 S. W. 919; Texas Brewing Co. v. Templeman, 90 Texas, 277, 38 S. W., 27; Whisenant v. Shores-Mueller Co. Civ. App., 194 S. W., 1175; Caddall v. Watkins Med. Co., Civ. App., 227 S. W., 226; Rawleigh Co. v. Watson, 256 S. W., 955; Rawleigh Co. v. Smith, 231 S. W., 799; Rawleigh Co. v. Newby, 194 S. W., 1173. Fourth\u2014 This unlawful agreement and its execution had sole reference to the methods of Land\u2019s resales (local to Fannin County, Texas). After the property had become his own and had been incorporated in the mass of property in the State; perforce, no element or aspect of interstate commerce was involved. Waters-Pierce Oil Co. v. Texas, 212 U. S., 99, 29 Sup. Ct., 222, 53 L. Ed., 425; same case, 48 Texas Civ. App., 162, 918; Browning v. Waycross, 233 U. S., 16; General Ry. Signal Co. v. Virginia, 246 U. S., 500; American Steel Wire Co. v. Speed, 192 U. S., 500; Brown v. Maryland, 12 Wheat, 419; May v. New Orleans, 178 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>U. S., 496; Woodruff v. Parham, 8 Wall., 123; Brown v. Houston, 114 U. S., 622.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-3\">In respect to the conclusion last stated, we may add that if. it were true that some relation did exist between the agreement and interstate commerce, that connection \u2014 and its effect, if any \u2014would be indirect and too remote to oust the State\u2019s power. Even a contract of purchase and sale of merchandise to move from one state into another (such as was under consideration in Dahnke-Walker Co. v. Bondurant, 257 U. S., 282) may also include provisions whose validity, manner of enforcement, etc., are to be governed by State law. This is squarely determined in General Ry. Signal Co. v. Virginia, supra, and it is recognized in New York Mfg. Co. v. Colley, 247 U. S., 21 \u2014 cited here by plaintiff in error. In that situation, the test is whether the particular stipulation is both \u201crelevant and appropriate\u201d \u2014 \u201cthat which is inherently intrastate does not lose its essential nature because it forms part of an interstate commerce contract to which it has no necessary relation.\u201d York Mfg. Co. v. Colley, supra; Fuqua v. Brewing Co., supra; Segal v. McCall Co., supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-4\">The nature and meaning of the instrument, as finally interpreted in the light of the jury\u2019s finding, being that described, the unlawful agreement had no direct, \u201cappropriate\u201d or \u201cnecessary\u201d relation to interstate commerce. It referred to sales of his own property (long since at rest in the State) made, and to be made, by Land within a defined territory of the State and to-persons there residing.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-5\">The additional matter in the 1921 \u201ccontract\u201d signed by Land is his agreement (in Paragraph 4) \u201cto pay * * * any balance due\u201d the Company \u201cat the date of the acceptance of this renewal contract.\u201d This new promise to pay is a substantial part of the consideration for the unlawful agreement. The illegal and the legal considerations (if there be any legal ones) are inextricably mingled and the papers (or other facts) do not furnish means whereby the unlawful considerations may be exclusively apportioned to the improper obligations so as to leave a valid obligation, complete in itself, supported by an independent valid consideration (if any such there be). .This portion of Paragraph 4, it results, is within the general rule \u201cthat a promise made upon several considerations, one of which is unlawful, no matter whether the illegality be at common law or by statute, is void\u201d (Edwards County v. Jennings, 89 Texas, 618, 35 S. W., 1053, 1054, and authorities there cited; Wegner Bros. v. Niering, 65 Texas, 506, same case, 76 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>Texas, 506, 13 S. W., 537; Reed v. Brewer, 90 Texas, 144, 37 S. W., 418).</p>\n<p id=\"b352-3\">The Company\u2019s suit is not one upon the \u201corders\u201d and \u201cacceptances\u201d whereby goods were procured from it by Land. The proof, without question, shows that each purchase was upon an \u201corder\u201d and \u201cacceptance\u201d thereof then made, and that complete and perfect title to the goods of each consignment passed to Land at Memphis, Tenn., or at Freeport, 111. The claim to relief is based, expressly, upon the written instrument above described and upon another agreement signed by Bobo, Skinner, and Graham, as \u201cguarantors,\u201d which is physically attached to the one signed by Land and which, by express and specific reference, incorporates that signed by Land. These papers are attached to the Petition, as a part of it, and are thus pleaded in haec verba as the basis of the Company\u2019s rights. They are there declared to be \u201cthe contract made by plaintiff and defendants, and it has not been annulled, substituted, changed or modified.\u201d The suit, then, is not one to recover the price, or value, of goods sold in interstate commerce; under our law, and practice, it is purely a suit upon the agreements evidenced by those papers \u2014 executed years after much of the so-called indebtedness had accrued \u2014 and the rights under the pre-existing agreements made in the \u201corders\u201d and \u201cacceptances\u201d have been abandoned. Coles v. Kelsey, 2 Texas, 542, 47 Am. Dec., 661; Cain v. Bonner, 108 Texas, 399, 402, 194 S. W., 1098. Having declared upon the so-called \u201ccontracts\u201d of Jan. \u2014, 1921, as a matter of State law, \u201cthe plaintiff\u2019s right of recovery was measured by them.\u201d Cain v. Bonner, supra. The two papers are made one and inseparable by the facts, by mutual reference, and in the pleading. The one (signed by Land) as shown, embraces and requires unlawful things, and in the other the \u201cguarantors\u201d are made to, and do, \u201cfully assent and agree\u201d to \u201call of the terms, provisions and agreements\u201d evidenced by the first. And but for this \u201cassent\u201d and \u201cagreement\u201d by the guarantors (the papers and the proof show) the unlawful agreement between Land and the Company would not have been made or consummated.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-4\">Violation of the State\u2019s Anti-Trust Law involves commission of a felony. Art. 1635, Revised Crim. Stat., 1925. Every person who encourages, etc., commission of crime is a principal. Arts. 65, 69, Ibid. A person who enters into a trust agreement or \u201cunderstanding of any character,\u201d \u201cbecomes a party <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>thereto or shall do any act in furtherance thereof\u201d or in \u201caid\u201d thereto, is guilty of a felony. Art. 1637, Ibid. By the very tie which binds them the \u201cguarantors\u201d are required to assume and share the guilt of Land and the Company. It is thus \u201cnominated in the bond.\u201d The guilt cannot be so allocated as to wipe the taint from one part of the contract and heap all contumely upon another part. The vice, as is the corrupted agreement, is indivisible. Segal v. McCall Co., supra.; Fuqua v. Brewing Co., supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-5\">As pleaded, the plaintiff\u2019s case could not be made out with-1 out bringing to its aid, and to the consideration of the court, the unlawful transactions. Hence there is no bases for recovery upon the theory (urged) that the \u201cillegal contract has been executed, the unlawful conduct has ended.\u201d The situation disclosed is one which makes the authorities cited to the proposition, (i. e. Hall v. Edwards, 222 S. W., 167; De Leon v. Trevino, 49 Texas, 91, 30 Am. Rep., 101; Cain v. Bonner, supra; Floyd v. Patterson, 72 Texas, 202; Haswell v. Blake, 90 S. W., 1125; Owens v. Davenport, 39 Mont., 555, 104 Pac., 682, 28 L. R. A. (N. S.) 996; Martin v. Richardson, 94 Ky., 183, 21 S. W., 1039, 19 L. R. A., 692, 42 Am. Rep. 353; Hertzler v. Geigley, 196 Pa., 419, 46 Atl., 366, 79 Am. St. Rep., 724; Hubbard v. Mulligan, 13 Colo. App., 116, 57 Pac., 738; Packard v. Byrd, 73 S. C., 51 S. E., 678, L. R. A. (N. S.) 547) condemn, rather than support it. The statute (Art. 7437, R. S. 1925) declares any such contract or agreement to \u201cbe absolutely void and not enforcible either in law or equity.\u201d That all-pervading force of the law which has been contemned may not rightly be broken, or tempered, by anything exhibited in this record.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-6\">We recommend an affirmance of the judgment.</p>\n<author id=\"b353-7\">Mr. Chief Justice CURETON</author>\n<p id=\"AM2\">delivered the opinion of the Supreme Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-8\">Consideration of the facts convinces us that the written contracts between the parties, interpreted in the light of the actual practices between them, were prepared and signed for the purpose of violating the Anti-Trust Laws of this State within the State, and that the obligations arose in consummating this purpose. This leads to our concurrence in the opinion of the Court of Civil Appeals on motion for rehearing and in the recommendation that the judgment of the Court of Civil Appeals be affirmed, and it is so' ordered.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
