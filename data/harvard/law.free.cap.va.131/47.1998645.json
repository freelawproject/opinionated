L. Redwine and the appellee, W. W. Francisco, which was appealed to the circuit court by the appellant, T. P. Gilmer, a right of way for a road over the land of the appellant was condemned and established as a private road, to be built and kept up by the applicants, upon a location designated in the report of S. T. Mitchell, surveyor, of his survey thereof, and in the order of the board of supervisors as beginning at a certain known beginning point, about which there is no controversy, to-wit: \u201cIn the county road at the intersection of an old road and a line of la boundary of land deeded by Henry Osborne and wife to Charles Harris, dated January 16, 1847, thence\u201d (and this is the line in controversy in the case) \u201cwith said line S. 19% E. 426% feet to a stake corner to Jake Harris,\u201d * * * etc.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b76-8\">The final order of the circuit court, which approves the order of the board of supervisors and thus establishes the road in the proceeding mentioned, was entered on January 18, 1917.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b77-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>It appears from the record that subsequently a suit for injunction was instituted in the same circuit court by Red-wine and Francisco against the appellant, Gilmer, his agent, etc., to restrain him and them from in any way interfering with said road and the use thereof by the complainants. The only parts of the record in that suit which appear in the record before us are an order of July, 1917, granting a preliminary injunction \u201caccording to the prayer of the bill,\u201d and the final decree in such suit, entered March 15, 1918, in which the cause is brought on to be heard \u201cupon the bill and exhibits, the answers and exhibits * * * and the evidence in support of the bill,\u201d and the court decreed perpetuating the preliminary injunction and decided \u201cthat the complainants are entitled to the road as established by the board of supervisors and approved or affirmed by this court on the law side thereof, the center line of which road is the survey made and reported by T. S. Mitchell, surveyor.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b77-5\">On June 19, 1919, Francisco presented a complaint in writing to the judge of said circuit court, in vacation, in which he recited the granting by the court of said preliminary and perpetual injunctions; alleged that the latter was still in force; further alleged that since the granting of such injunction \u201csome person or persons has or have\u201d placed a fence so as to take approximately three-fifths of the road as located, alleging that the fence begins at or near the west edge of the road or right of way and gradually deflects from the west side until it crosses the center line of the road as located; that it is practically impossible to travel over the road with a wagon; that the fence obstructs the road and violates the injunction; and that said fence also interferes with the use of said road by complainant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b77-6\">The complaint then charges, on information and belief, that T. P. Gilmer, and two other persons named, \u201cbuilt the fence and obstructed the road,\u201d and filed therewith two af<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>fidavits, which are to the effect that the fence was built, as charged in the said complaint, by T. P. Gilmer and the two other persons aforesaid; that \u00a1affiants were present when T. S. Mitchell, surveyor, surveyed the road and \u201cput in the stakes marking the center line of the survey and the boundary lines;\u201d and that the fence obstructed the road as so located on the ground, as alleged in said complaint.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b78-5\">The said complaint prayed: (1) \u201cThat your honor issue a rule, attachment, or such process as is proper for said T. P. Gilmer\u201d and the two other persons aforesaid, \u201cdirecting them to appear before your honor at such time and place as your honor may direct;\u201d (2) \u201cthat such further order enter or process issue as will require said parties to obey the mandate of the circuit court;\u201d (3) \u201cthat an order be entered directing the sheriff to remove said fence and obstructions from said road, and, if necessary, authorizing the sheriff to summon T. S. Mitchell, the surveyor, to point out the survey as established by the court and make report thereof;\u201d and (4) \u201cthat \u00a1any other or further order necessary be entered.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b78-6\">Thereupon, on June 19, 1919, in vacation, the judge of said circuit court entered an order, reciting the presentation and prayer of the said complaint, \u201cthat a rule be awarded against T. P. Gilmer\u201d and said two other persons, \u201cfor violating the injunction\u201d orders aforesaid; and reciting the filing of said affidavits with said complaint. Whereupon, the order states that \u201cit appearing from an examinar tion of the facts presented that a rule should be awarded,\u201d thereupon proceeds to award a rule against Gilmer and the other two parties aforesaid, returnable to the first day of the next ensuing September term of said court, 1919, to show cause, if any they can, why they and each of them should not be punished for contempt of court for violating the terms of the injunction (aforesaid) * * * by obstructing the road established by the board of supervisors <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>* * * and affirmed by the circuit court by the order (aforesaid), land the interfering with the use thereof by the applicants * *</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b79-6\">The same order thereupon continues as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b79-7\">\u201cIt further appearing from the facts presented that there are now obstructions in said road which interfere with the use thereof, it is ordered that C. W. Dougherty, sheriff of Scott county, remove any and all obstructions which have been placed on s'aid road in violation of the writ of injunction of March 15, 1918, and for the purpose of ascertaining the exact location of said road the sheriff is authorized and directed to summon T. S. Mitchell, the surveyor, who shall point out. the road as located by him. The sheriff will make a report of his action to the September term, 1919, of said court.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b79-8\">This order was spread on the books in the clerk\u2019s office of said circuit court on June 20, 1919.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b79-9\">On May 20, 1920, in term, the further order was entered by said circuit court in the proceeding commenced by said petition, which is the order appealed from, which order, after reciting that the execution of the' former order of June 20, 1919, was held up or suspended by direction of the court, and that meanwhile C. W. Daugherty\u2019s term of office as sheriff had expired, and that Creed Frayser had qualified in his stead as sheriff of the county, provided that it was \u201cordered * * * that Creed Frayser, sheriff, proceed forthwith to execute and carry out said order of June 20, 1919, and to remove said obstructions according to the direction of said order and make report thereof to the next term of this court.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b79-10\">The foregoing statement shows all that is disclosed by the record in this case upon which and upon the petition therefor the appeal was allowed. The petition for appeal, however, states that the real controversy in the case involves the right and title of the appellant, Gilmer, to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>land west of the road as correctly located on the ground, in accordance with the orders of the board of supervisors and of the court establishing the same. As stated in the petition for appeal, the appellant \u201cclaims the center of the road to be on a line different from S. 19% E. That is, that the surveyor, in locating the road, actually located the same on a line different from S. 19% E., but by mistake reported same on the degree S. 19% E. * * * (so that) \u201cthe center of the road\u201d (as established by the orders aforesaid) is not \u201cwhere the surveyor actually ran the line * * * on the ground and drove the stakes.\u201d And appellant further claims that he located his fence, which the order appealed from directed the sheriff to remove, so that it did not obstruct the road if the road were correctly located on the ground in accordance with the orders of the board of supervisors and the court aforesaid. Appellant further takes the positions in his petition that the circuit court has never had any evidence before it on which to adjudicate the question of the true location of the road on the ground in accordance with said orders establishing it, and further that the order appealed from was void because the court had no <em>ex parte </em>jurisdiction to enter it, and no jurisdiction of the appellant so as to authorize it to enter such order, since he was not summoned and made no appearance as a party defendant to the proceeding in which the order appealed from was entered. The petition for appeal also takes the position that since the appeal was granted the contempt proceeding against appellant above mentioned has been dismissed. The brief for appellee does not deny that the latter allegation is correct.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b80-6\">The brief for appellee, however, moves this court to dismiss the appeal, and the same motion was made in oral argument, on the ground that, pending the appeal, the sheriff has executed the order appealed from by removing the fence aforesaid from the road as located on the ground <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>by the surveyor, and that the road as so located has been since and is now unobstructed. And these facts are made to appear before us by satisfactory evidence, which is not controverted by the appellant.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b81-5\">S. <em>H. Bond, W. H. Nickels </em>and <em>L. P, Summers, </em>for the appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b81-6\"><em>W. S. Cox and J. P.

E. 228, and cases cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-9\"><bracketnum>[2-4]</bracketnum> The court below had no jurisdiction, in the <em>ex parte </em>proceeding in which the \u00a1appellant was not before the court, when the order appealed from was entered, to affect the right or title of the appellant to the land which he claims is in truth in controversy. So far as such right or title is concerned, if it exists, the order appealed from was and is plainly void, if it had no other support than appears from the record before us, as the appellant claims is the case. Whether the latter claim of appellant is correct or not, the record before us is insufficient for us to determine. It may or may not be that the question of the true location of the road on the ground in accordance with the course of the center of the road as established by the orders of the board of supervisors and the circuit court was put in issue by the pleadings and proof in the injunction suit land decided by the final decree therein. If so, that matter would be <em>res adjudicata so </em>far as the appellant is concerned. If not so, and if not adjudicated in the road condemnation proceed<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>ing, or other proceeding in which appellant wias a party, that matter is still undetermined and unaffected by the order of court under review. Neither the bill nor the evidence in the injunction suit nor the evidence in the road-condemnation proceedings being before us, we cannot pass upon the question as to whether the matter is <em>res adjudicata </em>because of what took place in those proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-5\"><bracketnum>[5]</bracketnum> In so far as the removal of the fence is concerned, since it'has been removed pending the appeal (this having occurred, as we understand it, before, the writ of supersedeas was executed), no order we could enter would prevent that removal. The case not being one in which the right of the appellant to restore or have the fence restored is involved, since such right, if it exists, has not been affected by the order appealed from, we have no jurisdiction to enter upon the consideration of the question of whether the appellant is entitled to the alternate relief of a decree against the appellee requiring him' to restore the fence.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-6\">The appeal will, therefore, be dismissed, without prejudice to the appellant to assert in any other proper proceeding such right or title as he may have, if any, to the land which he claims in his petition for the appeal to be in controversy.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-7\">\n<em>Dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
