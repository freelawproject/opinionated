Waters and <em>Watercourses\u2014Riparian Rights\u2014Diversion by Upper Landoivner\u2014Case at </em>Bar.\u2014The instant case involved a controversy over the diversion of the waters of a spring from an adjoining tract at a lower level than the spring. The trial court upon conflicting and highly contradictory evidence was not satisfied that the complainant had identified the waters of the spring which disappeared upon defendant\u2019s land with the water in the watercourse watering complainant\u2019s land, unless it was in the form of seepages, or percolations through the soil; nor was it satisfied that complainant had established by a preponderance of the evidence that the water diverted by defendant had reduced the flow of water upon his land.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b99-5\"><em>Held: </em>That the burden of proof was upon the complainant, and that the Supreme Court of Appeals was unable to draw a different conclusion from the evidence, or pronounce the conclusion of the trial court to be erroneous.</syllabus>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b99-6\">Appeal from a decree of the Circuit Court of Tazewell county.

M. McGinnis, in Burk\u2019s Garden, Tazewell county, Va.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-13\">In March, 1904, McGinnis and wife conveyed a portion of this land, containing about fifty acres, to Cleveland T. Heninger and others. Later, Heninger acquired several of the shares of the other tenants.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-14\">From a diagram in the record, it appears that the fifty-acre tract adjoins the balance of the McGinnis land on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>west, and is at a lower level than the spring, which was on the northern slope of a mountain. The dividing line between the two tracts is indicated on the diagram as a due north and south line. North of the spring, possibly half a mile, and near the line on the McGinnis side, is a house which, at successive periods, has been occupied by parties who testify in this case. The \u201cMountain Spring\u201d is described as a medium-sized, constantly flowing spring. A couple of hundred yards, more or less, below this spring and west of the dividing line that is on the McGinnis side, its waters disappear in a small piece of marshy ground. These waters flow-in a defined gulley, or drain, from the spring to this little marsh, or place of disappearance. Below this marsh there is dry ground and sod, and a slight elevation across the course of the gulley. On the other side of this elevated ground is a hollow, starting on the mountain south of the \u201cMountain Spring,\u201d and running downwards in a somewhat northeasterly course. This hollow starts and runs on the McGinnis land until a point is reached just above and south of the house mentioned, <em>supra. </em>Here the course of the descending hollow crosses the line between McGinnis and the fifty-acre tract, and, about fifty yards further on, it terminates in a sink-hole in said tract. All water coming from the mountain along this hollow, or channel, supra, disappears in this sink.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-5\">In 1911, A. M. McGinnis and wife sold and conveyed to J. B. Meek and M. Castle the \u201cMountain Spring,\u201d with the right to maintain a pipe line therefrom, save \u201cas to the amount of water that would be carried by a half-inch pipe, which was reserved for the benefit of the land on which the spring was situated.\u201d Thereupon the said. Meek and Castle proceeded to wall in the spring, and lay a one-inch pipe therefrom in a ditch along the course of the boundary line between McGinnis\u2019 land and the fifty-acre tract, crossing the water channel above mentioned near the house on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>McGinnis side. This ditch was dug and the pipe line laid in May, 1911. At the spring, a half-inch pipe was inserted in said line. This pipe ran to a trough on the McGinnis land, and the overflow of the trough flowed by gravitation along the old channel of the spring to the little marsh heretofore described. There it passed below the surface and disappeared.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-5\">It is the contention of the complainant, Heninger (appellant here), that the waters of the \u201cMountain Spring,\u201d after disappearing in the swamp south of the dry sod and little ridge, <em>su/pra, </em>follow a subterranean channel, and appear on the other side of said ridge in the hollow which heads in the mountain. By natural flow in this channel, these waters would then run past the house previously described, and thence upon the fifty-acre tract, where they would be lost in the sink-hole fifty yards or more beyond said house.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-6\">In the year 1919, eight years after the diversion of the waters of the \u201cMountain Spring\u201d by Meek and Castle, Cleveland T. Heninger, part owner of the fifty-acre tract, filed his bill in chancery against said Meek and Castle, and A. M. McGinnis, in which he set up his interest in said tract by reason of his purchase from McGinnis and others, and alleged that the operations of said parties in walling in the \u201cMountain Spring\u201d and piping away the flow of same had deprived him of water to which he was entitled. Complainant specifically alleged in said bill that after the establishment of said pipe line, he was \u201cwholly deprived of all water on said fifty-acre tract,\u201d and to his very great detriment was compelled to drive his stock, pasturing on said tract, \u201coff said land, a distance of about a quarter of a mile, to water.\u201d Further, that \u201cthis interruption of the natural flow of water to which he was entitled, and the consequent loss to his tract, operated to greatly depreciate the value of his land.\u201d The court was asked to issue an injunction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>against the defendants, restraining them from continuing \u201cto divert the flow of water from said spring away from its natural bed and channel * * * and to remove all of said obstructions to said natural flow, and to permit the whole of the natural flow of said spring to flow into and follow the natural bed and channel in which it would naturally flow, upon the removal of the obstructions, except . so much as might be reasonably necessary for the reasonable use and purposes of A. M. McGinnis, to be used by him on his own land upon which said spring was situated.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"Ago\">The defendants answered this bill, denying\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b102-5\">First: That the flow of water from the \u201cMountain Spring\u201d \u201chad a fixed, permanent and well-defined channel and bed through which it flowed to where it crossed the boundary line of the fifty-acre tract.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b102-7\">Second: That \u201cthe water from said spring always flowed in a fixed, permanent and well-defined bed and channel by gravitation through and upon the said fifty acres of land.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"Af\">The answer alleged further, by way of defense, that the water which, for the greater part of the year, flowed in the hollow heading in the mountain, and thence upon the fifty-acre tract, came from sources other than the \u201cMountain Spring;\u201d that these sources of supply were springs in the hollow and seepages from the sides; that there was no evidence that the overflow from the \u201cMountain Spring,\u201d after it sank at the little marsh on the McGinnis land, ever reappeared at any portion of the course of the hollow below said spring; that the flow from this hollow upon the fifty-acre tract had never been constant, but was dependent upon the rains, and was, therefore, irregular and capricious; that the hollow, or water course, was dry at times, both before and after the pipe line was established from the spring, and that the pipe line was in no wise responsible for any interruptions of flow in this channel at any time after its establishment; that the flow of water down said hollow, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>which extends on to the fifty-acre tract, is not and never has been in any way diminished by reason of the removal of the water which respondents removed from the said spring through said pipe line.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-5\">The complainant filed certain exceptions to this answer, which were overruled. Thereafter, both parties took depositions, and the case coming on to be heard upon the pleadings and depositions, the court dismissed the plaintiff\u2019s bill. An appeal from, this decree brings the controversy before this court for review. The questions presented are largely questions of fact, as the exceptions appear to have been properly overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-6\"><bracketnum>[1,2]</bracketnum> Conceding that the waters of the \u201cMountain Spring\u201d flowed by a definite, marked channel to the point where they sank, and thence by a subterranean channel to the mountain hollow, reappearing there in such fashion that they could be identified, and thence proceeded by natural flow in the hollow to the fifty-acre tract, it would be true that McGinnis would be entitled to such portion only of these waters as would be necessary for the reasonable use and purposes of the tract on which the spring was located, and could not dispose of or interfere with the natural flow of the surplus. But if the waters of said spring disappear wholly on the McGinnis land, and do not appear in the hollow below the ridge, save in the form of seepages in the hollow, resulting from percolations through the soil, or if the waters that run in the hollow cannot be identified with the spring waters that disappear on the McGinnis land, then McGinnis would be entitled to dispose at will of the waters of the \u201cMountain Spring.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b103-7\">\u201cThe only difference in the application of the law to surface and sub-surface streams is in ascertaining the character of the streams. If it does not appear that the waters which come to the surface are supplied by a definite flowing stream, they will be presumed to be performed by the ordi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>nary percolations of water in the soil. * * * A stream, or water course, consists of bed, banks and water, and to maintain the right to a water course, it must be made to appear that the water necessarily flows in a certain direction, and by regular channel, with banks or sides, and having a substantial existence, but it need not be shown that the water flows continually, as it may be dry at times.\u201d <em>Tampa Water Works </em>v. <em>Cline, </em>37 Fla. 586, 20 So. 780, 33 L. R. A. 376, 53 Am. St. Rep. 262; <em>Roath </em>v. <em>Driscoll, </em>20 Conn. 533, 52 Am. Dec. 352.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-5\"><bracketnum>[3]</bracketnum> In Gould on Waters (3d ed.), sec. 280, it is said: \u201cWater percolating through the ground and beneath the surface, either without a definite channel, or in courses which are unknown, and unascertainable, belongs to the realty in which it is found.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b104-6\">The following from a note to the case of <em>Wheatley </em>v. <em>Baugh, </em>64 Am. Dec. 727, is cited approvingly in <em>Miller </em>v. <em>Black Rock Springs Imp. Co., </em>99 Va. 747, 40 S. E. 27, 86 Am. St. Rep. 924: \u201cWater percolating beneath the surface without a definite channel, or in courses which are unknown and unascertainable, is not subject to the settled law governing the rights of riparian owners. * * * Waters which thus appear not to be supplied by a definite flowing stream, are presumed to be the result of the ordinary percolations of water in the soil; such a presumption being necessary to obviate the difficulty of determining whether the water flows in a channel. * * * Where percolating water is found, it belongs to the realty where found.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b104-8\"><bracketnum>[4]</bracketnum> It is essential for the lower riparian owner who claims that an upper owner has diverted waters to which the former was entitled, to establish that the waters alleged to have been diverted would, without such diversion, flow in natural course upon his land. In other words, the flow on one man\u2019s land must be identified with that on the land of the neighbor.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>The evidence in this case as to the source and volume of the water flowing by the mountain hollow upon the fifty-acre tract is, in the highest degree, conflicting.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-5\">All of the witnesses agree that the \u201cMountain Spring\u201d has a continuous flow, which is but very little affected by weather conditions; but, with respect to the other facts in issue, they are in acute conflict. Nor is this a conflict of witnesses with unequal opportunities of observation. In large measure, the witnesses testifying have been so situated in the matters of location and occupation, with respect to the premises in question, that their opportunities of observation with regard to the volume of water flowing in the hollow below the' \u201cMountain Spring\u201d are practically equal. The witnesses for the complainant, with substantial unanimity, state that from year to year -until the spring was piped, enough water flowed in the hollow to supply the wants of the fifty-acre tract. Several of these witnesses lived in the house mentioned, <em>supra. </em>On the other hand, the witnesses of the defendant, with practically equal opportunities of observation\u2014some having lived in the same house, and others in the immediate neighborhood of the spring\u2014state that formerly, as now, the waters in the hollow ceased to run during several months of the year, the flow being dependent upon the character of the season, and that there is at present, taking the flow from month to month, as much water flowing in the hollow, and thence to the sink-hole in the fifty-acre tract, as flowed before the spring was walled in and the pipe inserted. An illustration of the sharp and direct conflict between the witnesses will be afforded by the following extracts from the record placed in immediate juxtaposition. This testimony relates directly to the volume and flow of the water in the hollow at the house, <em>supra, </em>before it entered upon the fifty-acre tract.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-6\">The witness for the complainant whose testimony is cited in this connection is Nannie Rhudy; the witness for the defendant is H. Rosenbaum, now chief of police at Graham, Va.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b106-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>Nannie Rhudy.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b106-5\">Q.

During the time you were there, where did the water from the spring run?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b106-29\">A. The water from the spring ran down possibly 200 or 300 yards, and most of it sank. The water from the spring in controversy never did run .down to amount to anything to where we had our watering-trough. There was another spring below this that furnished the water down to the trough (a smaller spring), where our watering-place was.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b106-30\">Q.

(This refers to a spring near the Mc-Ginnis house that did not empty into the mountain hollow, but flowed a little way and sank on the McGinnis land. It was not a source of supply for the water in the hollow.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AZJ\">Q.

You have stated that the spring or two springs below the \u201cMountain Spring\u201d which fed the branch that ran by your house were not dry the years that you were there, but the branch was dry.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b110-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b110-5\">Q. Do I understand from this that the water from that spring, or those springs during the dry seasons always sank or disappeared before reaching the house?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Am\">A. Yes, sir; we didn\u2019t have any water there to use at all in the summer time, neither summer I was there. When there would come a wet spell, that water would run on Mr. Heninger\u2019s place, but it would dry up maybe in a day or so. Maybe there would be a few drops in the trough; just a little, but not enough to water stock at 'all, and then at times it would be dry\u2014just as dry as it is on this floor.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b110-7\">The evidence relied upon by the complainant to establish his case is the evidence relating to the flow of water in the mountain hollow prior to 1911, and the evidence that this flow was greatly reduced after the pipe line was established. It is contended that the coincidence of the reduction of flow in the hollow in the summer months of the year, with the diversion of the waters of the spring by the pipe line, indicates that the spring waters in their natural flow supplied a measurable proportion of the water in the hollow above the McGinnis house. Apart from the evidence that the flow of water in the hollow was greatly reduced after May, 1911, when the water was piped from the \u201cMountain Spring\u201d by the vendees of McGinnis, there is no sufficient evidence to identify the water in the hollow with the overflow from this spring. Undoubtedly, there <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>was flowing water in this hollow during the greater portion of the year, but there were two springs in the hollow, the larger one on the left-hand bank of the hollow going north.. This would be the west bank of the hollow, or the bank opposite to the marsh where the waters of the spring disappeared. Conceivably, this might be point of appearance of the waters of the \u201cMountain Spring,\u201d though they would be more naturally expected to appear on the east bank of the hollow. But if the waters of the \u201cMountain Spring,\u201d pursuing a distinct subterranean channel, appeared at this point after sinking at the marsh, it would seem that the flow of this spring, if not as great, would be measurably as constant and regular as the flow of the parent waters. But such was not the case. The evidence shows that the flow of this spring was uncertain and irregular, and at times was so slight as to run but a short distance in the hollow. The other sources of supply in the hollow were the second spring, of which little note is taken by the witnesses, seep-ages along the sides of the channel, and the flow from the head of the hollow due to rains, or melting snows, and persisting during wet seasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-5\">The defendants put on the stand various witnesses to establish the origin of the waters in the hollow. One of these witnesses was an elderly man named J. C. Kitts, who lived for two years a few hundred yards from the '\u201cMountain Spring,\u201d and who testifies in great detail on the above line. The following extracts are from his testimony:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b111-6\">\u201cQ. When you lived there twenty-five or thirty years ago, state how the water from the spring ran down the mountain and what became of it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b111-7\">\u201cA. Well, it came down the mountain\u2014not very far * * * and sank there. It was a low, marshy place.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b111-8\">\u201cQ. Did all of it sink?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b111-9\">\u201cA. Yes, sir, all of it sank.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b111-10\">\u201cQ. Did that water that sank reappear at any time, so far as you were able to tell?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b112-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>\u201cA. No, sir; it never did, so far as I was able to see.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b112-5\">\u201cQ. Do you know where the water came from that ran down the hollow, and ran on to the fifty-acre tract?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b112-6\">\u201cA. There are some wet-weather springs up there that seep out of the bank; one spring that ran about all of the time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b112-7\">\u201cQ. On which side of the gully (1 e., hollow) was this spring?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b112-8\">\u201cA. On the right-hand side, as you went up the hollow <em>(i. e., </em>the west side).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b112-10\">* * **</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b112-11\">\u201cQ. During the two years that you were there, state whether or not water constantly flowed on to the fifty-acre tract, or whether there were times when there was no water flowing on this tract?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b112-12\">\u201cA. There were times when there was no water there. In dry times of the year, there wasn\u2019t any water that ran down on that tract.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b112-13\">\u201cQ. Was that true of both years you were there?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b112-14\">\u201cA. Yes, sir\u2014both years.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b112-15\">\n<em>Cross-Examination.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b112-16\">\u201cQ. During the two years that you knew it, how much of the time would you say that the water did not run down there, expressed in weeks, months, or days?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b112-17\">\u201cA. Well, something like, I would say, three months out of the year that it did not run down there to amount to anything at all.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b112-18\">* * * H*</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b112-19\">\u201cQ. Would there be any time when no water flowed down on the fifty-acre tract, unless it was an unusually dry time?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b112-20\">\u201cA. Well, there were times when there wasn\u2019t any flowing down there at all.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b112-21\">\u201cQ. Would that be when it was unusually dry?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b112-22\">\u201cA. Well, it would be when the weather was dry; it would not be right after a rain.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b113-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>Ht H\u00ab H* \u2756</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b113-5\">\u201cQ. Will you tell me where the water came from that you have testified did flow on the fifty-acre tract, except in the dry weather you have described?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b113-6\">\u201cA. I suppose it came from the seeps along where the branch ran.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b113-7\">\u201cQ. Isn\u2019t it a fact that there is no constant spring that runs all the time anywhere along the hollow leading to the fifty-acre tract, other than the \u2018Mountain Spring?\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b113-8\">\u201cA. None that I know of, except the springs along the branch <em>(i. e., </em>hollow) below the spring there.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b113-9\">\u201cQ. Do you call them constant springs?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b113-10\">\u201cA. No. There is one spring up there that I never saw dry. It may not go dry, but it didn\u2019t afford much water.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b113-11\">\u201cQ. Would it have afforded the water that you say ran on the fifty-acre tract?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b113-12\">\u201cA. No, no; there was no water there except them seeps, only in wet weather.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b113-14\">$ $ $ $</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b113-15\">\u201cQ. Well, you have just said, when I asked you if that spring would have furnished the water: No, no; that it would not have furnished the water that ran on the fifty-acre tract. Isn\u2019t that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b113-16\">\u201cA. Well, I don\u2019t suppose it would have furnished the water altogether. It would furnish it after a rain. In the wet part of the year, it would furnish the water all along down there.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b113-17\">This witness, on re-examination, stated that the bulk of the seepages into the hollow, or branch, were on the side of same next to the \u201cMountain Spring;\u201d that is to say, on the other side of the little ridge from the marsh at which the spring waters disappear. Various witnesses for the defendants corroborate the above statements of the witness, Kitts. There are no waters appearing in the hollow that are in any way sufficiently identified as the waters from the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>\u201cMountain Spring.\u201d It is posible that the seepages come from that spring, and it is further possible that the spring referred to by Kitts on the right-hand side of the hollow going up may be the reappearance of the waters of the \u201cMountain Spring.\u201d This possibility is not denied by the witnesses for. the defendants, though they do not consider that the identity of the waters is established. There is one noteworthy fact in the evidence proper to be mentioned in this connection. The pipe from the spring was laid in a ditch that followed the dividing line between McGinnis and the fifty-acre tract, and crossed the hollow from the mountain near the McGinnis house, referred to, <em>supra. </em>This ditch' was dug in May, 1911. From the testimony of the complainant, it would be expected that at this date water would be flowing in this channel upon the fifty-acre tract, since the disappearance, or reduction of this flow is traced to the diversion of the constantly flowing waters of the \u201cMountain Spring\u201d by the pipe line. At the time the ditch was being dug, the full flow of the waters of the \u201cMountain Spring\u201d was emptying into the little marsh where they disappeared. Several, if not all, of the parties- who dug this ditch testify that when they crossed the hollow near the McGinnis house, the same was \u201cdry as a bone.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b114-5\"><bracketnum>[5]</bracketnum> The trial court was not satisfied that the complainant had identified the water in the hollow with the flow from the \u201cMountain Spring,\u201d unless it was in the form of seep-ages, or percolations through the soil, or had established by a preponderance of the evidence that the water diverted by the pipe line, had reduced the flow of water upon the fifty-acre tract. This burden was upon the complainant. After a careful review of the conflicting and highly contradictory evidence in the record, we are not able to draw a different conclusion from the evidence from that derived <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>by the learned trial court, or to pronounce that conclusion to be erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-5\">If the waters of the \u201cMountain Spring\u201d appear in the hollow in the form of seepage, or percolating waters only, the complainant is not entitled to relief. Taking the view most favorable to the complainant of the evidence in the record, it is not considered that he has identified the disappearing waters of the \u201cMountain Spring,\u201d save to the extent of these seepages, or percolations; nor upon the evidence as a whole are we able to conclude that he has demonstrated that the reduction, if any, of the annual flow of the water upon- his land, is traceable to the piping of this spring by the defendants, Meek and Castle.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-6\">Upon well-established principles, the decree of the trial court must be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
