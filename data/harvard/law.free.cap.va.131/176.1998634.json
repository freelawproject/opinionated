The lease contained the following provisions with respect to the use of the premises, etc., namely, that the premises were \u201cto be used for general wholesale merchandise and for no other purpose, for the term of (36) thirty-six months, to commence on the first day of May, 1919, at the rent of * * * $295.00 per month, payable in regular monthly payments of $295.00 at the office of the agent of the lessor in the city of Roanoke on the 1st day of June, 1919, and each successive month thereafter during the continuation of this lease.

This subletting was in fact for a period of one year to begin on May 1, 1919. There is a conflict in the evidence as to whether the lessor, Hartsook, knew of the length of this subletting until the next February or March, but there is evidence tending to show that he knew of this prior to or on April 22, 1919, and we will regard that as a fact in the case. It is an uncontroverted fact that the lessor, Hartsook, on or before April 22, 1919, knew that Jabbour Brothers had sub-let said corner store room to Constantine and objected to this sub-letting of such room, to be used for the sale of candy and fruit, in an interview, or interviews, with.one of the partners of Jabbour Brothers. On April 22, 1919, according, to Hartsook\u2019s testimony, he went over to see one of the partners, whom he mentions, and said to him, \u201cI understand that you have rented this building\u201d (the said corner store room) \u201cto Mr. Constantine.\u201d \u201cAnd they said, \u2018He is a poor fellow and we haven\u2019t any goods to go in there yet, and I thought I would let him go in there until we got some goods to go in there.\u2019 And I said, \u2018That is not in accordance with our contract and I insist on your not putting him. in.\u2019 And I went back and wrote a letter and said that, \u2018If you do put him <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>in there I am going to charge you additional rent.\u201d This letter was as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b207-5\">\u201cHartsook <em>&amp; </em>Cleaton,</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b207-6\">\u201cReal Estate\u2014Rental Agents</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b207-7\">\u201cRoanoke, Va., April 22, 1919.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b207-8\">\u201cJabbour Brothers,</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b207-9\">\u201cMarket Square, City.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b207-10\">\u201cDear Sirs:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b207-11\">\u201cThis is to notify you that in subrenting the corner room (Market Square) for candy and fruit store is not in accordance with our contract, as it was distinctly agreed upon to use same for merchandise in dry goods line only and I told Mr. Jibran (Jabbour) that I understood the party \u25a0on the corner had rented same and that it was unsatisfactory to do so, and, by so doing I will demand an additional rent of $12.50 per month while he remains a tenant, so \u25a0 you will have to charge the new tenant the advance.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b207-12\">\u201cThis will be your sufficient notice to that effect.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b207-13\">Yours very truly,</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b207-14\">\u201cHartsook &amp; Cleaton,</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b207-15\">\u201cBy T. E. B. Hartsook.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b207-16\">The testimony of and for the lessor, Hartsook, is silent as to whether Jabbour Brothers, on or after the receipt of this letter, consented to its stipulation for and agreed to pay the extra rent of $12.50 per month thereby demanded. Such testimony is to the effect that Jabbour Brothers never actually paid or offered actual payment of this extra rent, until the tender of their check, dated April 8, 1920, which included this accrued extra rent to April, 1920, which tender was made on April 8, 1920, as is hereinafter further mentioned.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b207-17\">The testimony of one of the Jabbour brothers as to what occurred on the last named subject when they received the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>letter of April 22, 1919, is, so far as in point, as follows: \u201cMr. Hartsook brought this letter and says, \u2018being as you all are going to rent to this man, we must have $12.50 more for his store. * * *\u2019 I told Mr. Hartsook it would be all right. * * *\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b208-5\">Following this, Constantine took possession of said corner storeroom and entered upon his subtenancy on May 1, 1919.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b208-6\">There is other testimony of this witness in the record to the effect that his concern had a large expense in putting the corner store in condition for use, and that subsequently they did not pay the extra rent because they were asking Mr. Hartsook not to insist on it because of the said expense they had been put to and because they had been really trying to meet Mr. Hartsook\u2019s wishes and get Constantine to vacate the store and hoped to do so, but failed; and that when Mr. Hartsook rendered a bill in December, 1919, for the extra rent then accrued, the witness \u201cassured him if that was the only penalty we would be willing to pay it;\u201d but did not in fact then or afterwards pay it, as they were taking all the time they eould get on it and hoped to get Hartsook to waive his demand for it up to the time of their receipt of the notice to vacate, presently to be mentioned.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b208-7\">The $295.00 monthly rent stipulated for in the original lease was promptly paid each month by the lessees and accepted by the lessor up to and including the month of March, 1920.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b208-8\">On the side of the lessor, Hartsook, the testimony is to the effect that he did not intend to insist on the payment of the extra rent for which he stipulated in the letter of April 22, 1919, and which the testimony for Jabbour Brothers shows they agreed to pay, if Jabbour Brothers had gotten Constantine to vacate the corner room aforesaid within a short time, and that they kept leading him along by fair prom<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>ises as to getting Constantine out, and hard luck talk from time to time until December 20, 1919, when he wrote them the letter, which so far as material, is as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b209-5\">\u201cHartsook &amp; Cleaton,</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b209-6\">\u201cReal Estate and Rental Agents.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b209-7\">\u201cRoanoke, Va., Dec. 20, 1919.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b209-8\">\u201c107 Terry Building,</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b209-9\">\u201cJabbour Brothers,</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b209-10\">\u201cMarket Square, Roanoke, Va.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b209-11\">\u201cDear Sirs:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b209-12\">\u201cWe herewith submit a bill for extra rents of $75.00 to December 1st 1919, on corner room now occupied by George Constantine, Confectioner.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b209-13\">\u201cMy notice of April 22nd notifying you that the sub-renting of same to this tenant was not in accordance with the terms of your contract, which was to be used for Dry Goods business.

This presents the following question:</p>\n<p id=\"b212-5\"><bracketnum>[1]</bracketnum> 1. Was the verdict of the jury plainly wrong or without evidence to support it?</p>\n<p id=\"b212-6\">This question must be answered in the affirmative.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-7\">In view of the fact that the evidence in the case shows that by mutual agreement between the lessor and the lessees, entered into before the term of the demise began, the monthly rent reserved was increased by $12.50 per month from the beginning of the term; that such extra rent was \u201cin arrears and unpaid\u201d when the notice was given on March 23, 1920, so that such notice terminated the tenancy ten days thereafter, to-wit, on April 3, 1920, in accordance with the seventh clause of the lease, and the tender on April 8, 1920, of the rent in arrears, being after such termination, was too late to prevent the termination which had already occurred; and as there was no conflict in the evidence on those subjects, it seems plain to us that there was no evidence before the jury to sustain the verdict for the lessees, and that the verdict was plainly contrary to the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-8\">This being so, all the other matters in controversy in the case, concerning whether under the second clause of the lease there was a forfeiture because of the subletting, or a forfeiture because of the use of the premises for a purpose other than for a general wholesale merchandise provided for in the lease, or whether such forfeitures were waived by the lessor by his acceptance of rent prior to the giving of the notice last mentioned, and other interesting questions raised in connection with these subjects ,\u00bfn behalf of the respective parties and the authorities cited and relied on upon those questions and subjects become immaterial and, hence, need not be dealt with in this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number><bracketnum>[2]</bracketnum> The seventh clause of the lease provides that if the rent shall \u201cat any time be in arrears and unpaid,\u201d the lessor may terminate the lease at the expiration of ten days from the time of giving the notice, such as was given as aforesaid. Hence, neither the common law rules on the subject of what a landlord must do to terminate a lease because of non-payment of rent, nor the statute in Virginia on the subject, have any application. The subject is governed and controlled in the case in judgment by the express contract of the parties and by the action of the lessor in accordance therewith.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-5\">We are, therefore, of opinion that there was no error in the action of the trial court in setting aside the verdict of the jury and in entering judgment for the lessor.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-6\">The judgment under review will be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
