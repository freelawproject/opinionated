In particular, defendant contends that the trial court erroneously instructed the jury \u201cthat the state needed only to prove that defendant had a culpable mental state with respect to the occurrence of the collision and that no mental state applied to the damage element\u201d of the crime. We disagree with the basic premise of defendant\u2019s argument, <em>viz., </em>that the court instructed the jury that the state was not required to prove that defendant had a culpable mental state with respect to whether the vehicle he struck had sustained damage. In our view, the challenged jury instruction \u2014 considered together with the other instructions given \u2014 informed the jury that a mental-state requirement (here, knowledge) <em>did </em>apply to the \u201cdamage element\u201d of the charged crime. Consequently, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-5\">\u201cWe review the jury instructions for errors of law.\u201d <em>State v. Pierce, </em>235 Or App 372, 374, 232 P3d 978 (2010). In doing so, we consider the entirety of the instructions given\u2014 both when determining whether the trial court erred in giving a specific challenged instruction and in determining whether any such error was prejudicial. <em>See State v. Woodman, </em>341 Or 105, 118, 138 P3d 1 (2006) (\u201cIn determining whether it was error to give a particular instruction, we read the instructions as a whole to determine whether they state the law accurately.\u201d); <em>Pierce, </em>235 Or App at 374 (\u201cIn determining whether an instructional error requires reversal, we assess potential prejudice by considering the jury instructions as a whole.\u201d). Moreover, \u201c[b]ecause defendant is challenging the trial court\u2019s jury instructions, and not the sufficiency of the evidence supporting his conviction, we review all pertinent parts of the record.\u201d <em>State v. Naudain, </em>254 Or App 1, 2, 292 P3d 623 (2012), <em>rev den, </em>353 Or 788 (2013). Accordingly, we describe the evidence as it was presented at the jury trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-6\">Defendant was arrested the day after a minor motor-vehicle accident occurred in the parking lot associated with the apartment complex where he lived. On the day <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>of the accident, a few employees of a landscaping company had traveled in the company\u2019s truck to work at that apartment complex. One of the employees testified that he heard a noise as he was working about 10 feet away from the landscaping company\u2019s truck. He looked at the truck and saw that it \u201cwas moving\u201d even though nobody was in it. At about the same time, he saw a red Nissan Sentra leaving the parking area. He tried to approach the car, but it left too fast for him to reach. Another of the landscaping company\u2019s employees testified that the red Nissan had left the parking lot \u201cin a hurry.\u201d A third employee testified that the company\u2019s truck was damaged (\u201ca little bit bent * * * on top of the tire\u201d), and he called the police to report that somebody had hit the truck. None of the employees actually saw the impact.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-4\">The day after the accident, Beaverton Police Officer Christopher Crosslin spoke with defendant, who said that he was the only person who had driven the red Nissan the previous day and that he did not remember having hit anybody with his car.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Crosslin and defendant went out to the parking lot to look at defendant\u2019s car, which was not parked in defendant\u2019s normal parking space. Defendant explained that he had parked further away from his apartment to get some exercise.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-5\">After further discussion, Crosslin read defendant his <em>Miranda </em>rights, which defendant said he understood. Crosslin then \u201cchallenged\u201d defendant, saying that he did not believe what defendant was telling him and asking defendant to be honest. According to Crosslin, defendant eventually acknowledged that \u201cthere may have been a tap to the complainant\u2019s vehicle as he was backing out of his parking spot yesterday.\u201d Crosslin again asked defendant why he had not parked in his usual parking spot when he returned to the apartment complex. Defendant \u201cinitially maintained that he wanted to get exercise, but then eventually said, T was worried about the probability of getting caught.\u2019\u201d Crosslin then cited defendant for failing to perform the duties of a driver, in violation of ORS 811.700.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>Defendant testified in his own behalf at trial, explaining that he had been under a great deal of stress at the time of the incident and had been in a hurry to get to a library where he was studying for a professional examination. Defendant also testified that his hearing had been impaired at the time of the incident by a severe buildup of earwax. At least in part because of that, he asserted, he had not immediately realized that his car had hit the landscaping company\u2019s truck. Defendant also testified that he had parked his car away from his normal spot when he returned to the apartment complex so he could get exercise, not because he was trying to hide anything. In answer to Crosslin\u2019s testimony, defendant acknowledged that he had understood the questions that Crosslin asked him on the day after the accident, and defendant testified that he had answered those questions honestly. Defendant asserted that any ambiguity in his answers was the result of a lengthy interrogation by Crosslin and the way in which the officer had phrased his questions. Defendant acknowledged that \u201cultimately the evidence shows\u201d that he did hit the pickup truck. He testified that he did not reach that conclusion \u2014 that he had probably bumped into the truck \u2014 until he was arrested.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-4\">Before trial, defendant and the state each submitted proposed jury instructions. The parties\u2019 requested instructions overlapped significantly; in particular, both parties requested the uniform instruction that describes the elements of the crime of failure to perform the duties of a driver when property is damaged, as defined by ORS 811.700.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Although ORS 811.700 does not itself specify a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>culpable mental state, both parties asked the trial court to deliver an instruction that incorporated a \u201cknowingly\u201d mental state, and \u2014 in accordance with that request \u2014 the trial court gave this instruction:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b312-4\">\u201cIn this case to establish the crime of Failure to Perform the Duties of a Driver when property is damaged, the State must prove beyond a reasonable doubt the following seven elements:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b312-5\">\u201cNumber one, the act occurred in the City of Beaverton, Washington County, Oregon.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b312-6\">\u201cNumber two, that the act occurred on or about May 18th of 2011.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b312-7\">\u201cNumber three, that [defendant] was the driver of a vehicle that collided with any vehicle that was unattended.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b312-8\">\u201cAnd that the collision resulted in damage to an unattended vehicle.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b312-9\">\u201cAnd that the collision occurred on premises open to the public.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b312-10\">\u201cAnd that [defendant] knew he was involved in a collision that was likely to have resulted in damage to any unattended vehicle.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b312-11\">\u201cAnd it must be proven beyond a reasonable doubt that [defendant] did not immediately stop [and perform the duties of a driver as defined in ORS 811.700(l)(b).]\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b312-12\">The instruction at issue in this appeal relates to the sixth element of the crime described above: that defendant \u201cknew he was involved in a collision that was likely to have resulted in damage to any unattended vehicle.\u201d In association with that mental-state requirement, defendant requested the following additional instruction:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b312-13\">\u201cA person acts \u2018knowingly\u2019 or \u2018with knowledge\u2019 if that person acts with an awareness that a particular circumstance exists.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b312-14\">\u201cWhen used in the phrase \u2018[defendant] knew he was involved in a collision that was likely to have resulted in damage to any unattended vehicle,\u2019 a finding that [defendant] acted \u2018knowingly\u2019 or \u2018with knowledge\u2019 means a finding that [defendant] acted with an awareness that he had been involved in a collision <em>and with an awareness </em>[that] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>such a collision was likely to have resulted in damage to any unattended vehicle.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b313-4\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b313-5\">In a discussion of the parties\u2019 requested jury instructions, the trial court disapproved the instruction quoted above, reasoning that the state was not required to prove that\u201d the defendant was aware that damage had occurred.\u201d Instead, the court explained, the state was required to prove only that defendant knew \u201che was involved in an accident which like \u2014 which was likely to have resulted in damage to property.\u201d In response, defendant observed that the citation that Crosslin issued \u201calleges that the offense was committed knowingly\u201d and argued that the state was required \u201cto prove what they plead [ed] with regard to culpable mental state.\u201d Defendant acknowledged that the state did not have to prove that defendant <em>knew </em>that he had caused damage, and pointed out that his requested instruction did not include such a requirement. Instead, defendant argued, the state needed to prove, essentially, that defendant \u201cknew [the accident] was something he should have stopped for.\u201d In its objection to defendant\u2019s proffered instruction, the state focused on its contention that the requested instruction improperly told the jury that the state was required to prove \u201cthat the defendant knew that he caused damage, as well as he knew he created a collision.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b313-6\">In the end, the trial court orally delivered an amended version of defendant\u2019s requested mental-state instruction, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b313-7\">\u201cA person acts knowingly or with knowledge if that person acts with an awareness that a particular circumstance exists.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b313-8\">\u201cWhen used in the phrase, \u2018[defendant] knew he was involved in a collision that was likely to have resulted in damage to any unattended vehicle,\u2019 \u2018knowingly or with knowledge\u2019 means that [defendant] acted with an awareness that he was involved in a collision, <em>and it was likely damage had resulted to the unattended vehicle struck in the collision. </em>Knowingly or with knowledge.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b313-9\">(Emphasis added.) Thus, the orally delivered mental-state instruction largely mirrored the one proffered by defendant, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>except that the delivered instruction did not repeat the requirement that the state prove defendant\u2019s \u201cawareness\u201d immediately before it referred to the likelihood that damage had resulted from the collision.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> After instructions and deliberation, the jury ultimately convicted defendant of the charged crime.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b314-4\">On appeal, defendant argues that the trial court erred by \u201cgiving a jury instruction that affirmatively relieved the jury of determining whether defendant had a culpable mental state with respect to the damage element of failure to perform the duties of a driver when property is damaged.\u201d He contends that the delivered mental-state instruction \u201crequired the jury to determine only whether defendant was aware that he had been in a collision\u201d and erroneously did <em>not </em>require the jury to determine whether defendant also \u201chad a culpable mental state with respect to whether damage resulted to the other vehicle.\u201d Specifically, defendant argues that the delivered instruction was flawed because it failed to inform the jury that the state had to prove that defendant knew that the accident was likely to have caused actual damage at the time he failed to perform the required duties. Defendant contends that the knowledge requirement applies to the \u201cdamage element\u201d for two reasons. First, defendant argues that ORS 161.095(2) requires the state to prove a culpable mental state with respect to that element of the crime.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Second, defendant argues that the state committed itself to proving that defendant acted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>knowingly with respect to <em>all </em>elements of the crime when Crosslin checked a box labeled \u201c[k] nowing\u201d on the citation that he issued to defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-4\">In response to defendant\u2019s first argument, the state contends that defendant did not preserve his claim that the challenged instruction was flawed because it omitted the statutory requirement that the state prove a culpable mental state with respect to the \u201cdamage element.\u201d We reject that lack-of-preservation argument without further discussion. On the merits, the state contends that, under <em>State v. Hamlett, </em>235 Or App 72, 230 P3d 92 (2010), the state was not statutorily required to prove that defendant knew that the property that he hit likely had been damaged. In response to defendant\u2019s second argument, the state contends that the citation did not unambiguously indicate that the \u201cknowing\u201d mental state would apply to the \u201cdamage element\u201d as well as to defendant\u2019s awareness that a collision had occurred. Because the citation \u201cwas ambiguous as to whether \u2018knowingly\u2019 applies to the damage element,\u201d the state argues, the citation did not commit the state to prove a mental-state element that the statute describing the crime did not itself require.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-5\">We reject defendant\u2019s arguments, although for reasons different from those proffered by the state. Both of defendant\u2019s arguments are based on the premise that the delivered jury instructions informed the jury \u201cthat it was not required to decide whether defendant had a culpable mental state with respect to whether damage resulted to the other vehicle.\u201d As defendant emphasizes, his argument on appeal is not about <em>what level </em>of culpable mental state attaches to the \u201cdamages element,\u201d but is based on his contention that the delivered jury instructions <em>\u201centirely </em>relieved the state from proving a culpable mental state with respect to the damage element.\u201d (Emphasis added.) We do not agree that the jury instructions had that effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-6\">As noted above, the delivered jury instructions described seven elements of the charged crime, including the following facts that the state had the burden to prove:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b315-7\">\u201c[T]hat [defendant] was the driver of a vehicle that collided with any vehicle that was unattended.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b316-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>\u201cAnd that the collision resulted in damage to an unattended vehicle.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b316-4\">* * * <em>*</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b316-5\">\u201cAnd that [defendant] knew he was involved in a collision that was likely to have resulted in damage to any unattended vehicle.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b316-6\">Thus, the trial court told, the jury that the state had to prove, among other things, these two facts: (1) that a collision occurred, and (2) \u201cthat the collision resulted in damage.\u201d The instruction <em>also </em>told the jury that the state had to prove that defendant \u201cknew he was involved in a collision that was likely to have resulted in damage to any unattended vehicle.\u201d That instruction, itself, informed the jury that the state had to prove that defendant <em>knew </em>that the collision he caused \u201cwas likely to have resulted in <em>damage\u201d </em>\u2014 i.e., that defendant acted with a culpable mental state with respect to that element of the crime. Nothing about the instruction quoted above would have implied to the jury that the state had to prove only that defendant knew that a collision had occurred, without respect to whether he was aware that any damage probably had resulted.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-7\">Indeed, defendant acknowledges that the jury \u201cmight plausibly understand\u201d the instruction quoted above \u201cto require the jury to find that defendant knew that the collision likely resulted in damage.\u201d Nonetheless, he argues, a different instruction delivered by the trial court \u2014 the instruction specifically related to defendant\u2019s mental state\u2014 required the jury to find <em>only </em>\u201cthat defendant was aware of the collision\u201d and not that he had any awareness that damage likely resulted. That challenged instruction told the jury that,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b316-8\">\u201c[w]hen used in the phrase, \u2018[defendant] knew he was involved in a collision that was likely to have resulted in damage to any unattended vehicle,\u2019 \u2018knowingly or with knowledge\u2019 means that [defendant] acted with an awareness that he was involved in a collision, <em>and it was likely damage had resulted to the unattended vehicle struck in the collision. </em>Knowingly or with knowledge.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b316-9\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b317-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>Defendant contends that the jury would have understood the emphasized phrase to relate only to the physical circumstances of the crime \u2014 that is, to the <em>fact </em>that it was likely that damage had resulted to the unattended vehicle\u2014 and not to the state\u2019s need to prove defendant\u2019s awareness of that fact. He focuses on the presence of a comma separating the emphasized phrase from the one that precedes it, suggesting that the presence of \u201cinterruptive punctuation\u201d signaled that the mental-state requirement mentioned in the phrase before the comma did not apply to the phrase that followed it. For three reasons, we disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-4\">First, the challenged instruction related specifically to defendant\u2019s mental state, not to the other elements of the crime. The instruction started by referring to what defendant \u201cknew\u201d \u2014 including that \u201che was involved in a collision <em>that was likely to have resulted in damage\u201d </em>\u2014 and continued by explaining that variants on the word \u201cknew\u201d meant that defendant \u201cacted with an awareness that he was involved in a collision, <em>and it was likely damage had resulted\u201d </em>(Emphases added.) And in case that instruction had not sufficiently directed the jury\u2019s attention to defendant\u2019s mental state, the trial court concluded the instruction by emphasizing its focus: \u201cKnowingly or with knowledge.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b317-5\">Second, the challenged instruction would not have made any sense if considered as describing an element of the crime other than defendant\u2019s mental state. With respect to the physical circumstances of the crime, the trial court instructed the jury that the state had to prove that the collision <em>did </em>result in damage to an unattended vehicle. The challenged instruction referred, instead, to <em>likely </em>damage to the unattended vehicle. That reference makes sense only when understood in relationship to defendant\u2019s mental <em>state </em>\u2014 i.e. his knowledge that damage <em>likely </em>resulted from the collision. It could not properly be understood to refer to the physical result of the collision, which the state had to prove actually caused damage.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-6\">Finally, whatever significance a comma might have in a written jury instruction, we have no such instruction before us. Rather, we have only a transcript of the court\u2019s orally delivered instructions. The presence of a comma in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>such a transcript cannot bear the weight that defendant places on it. We are not persuaded that the comma indicates that the trial court paused or otherwise delivered the instruction with some inflection that would have changed its meaning in the way that defendant suggests.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-4\">In short, the instructions delivered by the trial court, when considered as a whole, did not \u201crelieve [] the state of proving a culpable mental state with respect to a material element of the crime,\u201d as defendant contends. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b310-6\"> It is not clear from the record how Crosslin knew that defendant was associated with the red Nissan.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b311-5\"> ORS 811.700 provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b311-6\">\u201c(1) A person commits the offense of failure to perform the duties of a driver when property is damaged if the person is the driver of any vehicle and the person does not perform duties required under any of the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b311-7\">\u00ab* * * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b311-8\">\u201c(b) If the person is the driver of any vehicle that collides with any vehicle that is unattended, the person shall immediately stop and:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b311-9\">\u201c(A) Locate and notify the operator or owner of the vehicle of the name and address of the driver and owner of the vehicle striking the unattended vehicle; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b311-10\">\u201c(B) Leave in a conspicuous place in the vehicle struck a written notice giving the name and address of the driver and of the owner of the vehicle doing the striking and a statement of the circumstances thereof.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b314-5\"> In describing the jury instruction that he challenges on appeal, defendant quotes solely the instruction as orally delivered by the trial court; he does not point to any written analog. Indeed, although the transcript indicates that the trial court intended to give the jury written instructions, in addition to the jury instructions that the trial court delivered orally, the trial-court file does not include copies of any written instructions that the court may actually have given the jurors (with respect to instructions, the file includes only copies of the instructions as requested by the parties). Accordingly, our analysis necessarily relies only on the instructions as orally delivered by the trial court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b314-6\"> The judgment in this case states that defendant was convicted of \u201cHIT AND RUN.\u201d Neither party has raised any issue related to the discrepancy between the crime as described in the citation \u2014 on which the challenged jury instruction was based \u2014 and the crime as described in the judgment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b314-7\"> ORS 161.095(2) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b314-8\">\u201c[A] person is not guilty of an offense unless the person acts with a culpable mental state with respect to each material element of the offense that necessarily requires a culpable mental state.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
