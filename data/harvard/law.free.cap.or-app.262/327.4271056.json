ORS 163.208; ORS 161.405. Defendant argued that the state had failed to prove venue as to that count. While defendant\u2019s appeal was pending, the Oregon Supreme Court issued its decision in <em>State v. Mills, </em>354 Or 350, 312 P3d 515 (2013), in which it overruled its prior decisions that required the state to prove venue at trial and held that, if a defendant disputes venue, the defendant must challenge it through a pretrial motion. Following <em>Mills, </em>we reversed and remanded \u201cas to Count 3 for the trial court to follow the procedure identified in <em>Mills.\u201d State v. Sharp, </em>261 Or App 554, 556, 323 P3d 519 (2014).</p>\n<p id=\"b348-5\">Defendant had also been convicted of one count of resisting arrest (Count 1), and a second count of attempted assault of a public safety officer (Count 4), but did not challenge those convictions on appeal. Our tagline stated, \u201cConviction on Count 3 reversed and remanded; remanded for resentencing; otherwise affirmed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b348-6\">Both defendant and the state have filed petitions for reconsideration, asserting that our tagline is inconsistent with the holding of the opinion. Both contend that resentencing is unnecessary. We agree and, therefore, allow reconsideration, withdraw our former tagline, and replace it with the following: Conviction on Count 3 reversed and remanded; otherwise affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-7\">Reconsideration allowed; former disposition withdrawn; conviction on Count 3 reversed and remanded; otherwise affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
