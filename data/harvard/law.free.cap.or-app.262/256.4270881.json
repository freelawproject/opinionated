Defendant contends that the trial court erred in concluding that the officer\u2019s seizure of the dog was justified under the \u201cplain view\u201d exception to the warrant requirement. Defendant further argues that, even if the officer lawfully seized the dog, the trial court erred in concluding that the veterinarian did not \u201csearch\u201d the dog because the veterinarian\u2019s actions \u2014 sampling and testing the dog\u2019s blood and feces and recording the dog\u2019s weight over several days \u2014 revealed information that otherwise would have been hidden or concealed and, therefore, violated defendant\u2019s protected privacy interests. The state responds that the dog was lawfully seized and, with respect to the veterinarian\u2019s actions, that defendant had no protected privacy interest in the dog\u2019s \u201cbody condition\u201d because, unlike other property, the dog had a right to care and to be free of neglect, and those rights \u201ctrump[ed]\u201d defendant\u2019s constitutional possessory and privacy rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-5\">We conclude that the officer lawfully seized the dog under the \u201cplain view\u201d exception to the warrant requirement because his observations of the dog while lawfully in defendant\u2019s apartment, together with information he received from defendant and a named informant, provided probable cause to believe that defendant had neglected the dog and the dog was evidence of that neglect. As to whether the veterinarian\u2019s actions invaded defendant\u2019s protected privacy interests, we reject the state\u2019s novel claim that an animal\u2019s statutory rights \u201ctrump\u201d a defendant\u2019s constitutional rights. Under the prevailing principles of Article I, section 9, of the Oregon Constitution governing privacy rights with respect to personal effects, we conclude that the extraction and testing of the dog\u2019s blood was a \u201csearch,\u201d because those actions constitute a physical invasion of defendant\u2019s personal property that revealed otherwise concealed evidence. Accordingly, we reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>We describe the facts consistently with the trial court\u2019s explicit and implicit findings, which the evidence supports. A named informant reported to the Oregon Humane Society that defendant\u2019s \u201cdog was being housed in a kennel for many hours of the day, it was being beaten by * * * defendant, and also wasn\u2019t being fed properly.\u201d An officer, working as an animal cruelty investigator, went to defendant\u2019s apartment to investigate the complaint. The officer entered the apartment with defendant\u2019s consent and saw the dog in the yard behind the home. The officer saw that the dog was \u201cin a near-emaciated condition\u201d and \u201cwas kind of eating at random things in the yard, and *** try[ing] to vomit. Nothing was coming up, but [the dog] was trying to vomit.\u201d The officer asked defendant why the dog was in that condition; defendant told him that she was out of dog food but was going to get more food that night.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-4\">The officer concluded that the dog \u201ccertainly appeared neglected\u201d and there was a \u201cstrong possibility\u201d that the dog needed medical care. He wanted to take the dog into custody and have it tested by a veterinarian \u201cin order to make a determination if [he] was going to pursue this criminally\u201d and to \u201cdetermine what [was] wrong with [the dog], to get him vet care.\u201d The officer asked defendant to sign a temporary medical release; she refused. The officer then took custody of the dog and brought it to the Humane Society.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-5\">At the Humane Society, a veterinarian took samples of the dog\u2019s blood and feces and tested those samples. The veterinarian also fed the dog, weighed the dog every three to four days, and charted the change in weight over time.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> According to the officer, those tests, taken together, showed that defendant\u2019s dog \u201cwas a healthy dog and with a basic plan of good quality food, he rapidly began to gain weight. So there basically was nothing wrong with him.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>Thus, the evidence was relevant to show that the dog\u2019s \u201cnear-emaciated\u201d condition resulted from neglect \u2014 lack of feeding \u2014 rather than sickness or disease.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-4\">Defendant filed a motion to suppress evidence derived from the warrantless seizure and search of her dog under Article I, section 9, and the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Defendant argued that dogs are personal property and that Article I, section 9, and the Fourth Amendment protected her possessory interest in her dog. Defendant also asserted that she had a privacy interest in her dog, and that the state and federal constitutions protected that interest \u201cwith the same force [they] protect [] the right to privacy in personal items such as boots and pocket knives.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b280-5\">As to the warrantless seizure of the dog, defendant argued that the \u201cplain view\u201d exception to the warrant requirement did not apply because the officer lacked probable cause to believe that the dog was evidence of a crime. Specifically, defendant argued that, \u201cat the time [the officer] seized the dog, he did not have probable cause to believe that the reason it was skinny was because of some failure on [defendant\u2019s] part.\u201d As a result, defendant argued, all \u201cderivative evidence\u201d of the warrantless seizure should be suppressed.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-6\">Further, defendant argued that, even if the seizure were lawful, she \u201cmaintained a protected privacy interest [under Article I, section 9,] in information about her dog not otherwise exposed to public view.\u201d Thus, in defendant\u2019s view, the \u201cbattery of laboratory tests on [the] dog\u2019s blood, fecal matter, feeding habits, and pattern of weight gain * * * [were] searches under Article I, Section 9 because the tests invade [d] [her] privacy interest in her dog by revealing information not otherwise exposed to public view.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Defendant asserted that the test results \u201creveal [ed] all these intimate details about the dog\u2019s body chemistry, about its blood levels, about its feeding habits, all of these things were information that was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>not otherwise exposed to public view.\u201d Ultimately, she contended that, assuming that the seizure of the dog was lawful, all evidence derived from the veterinarian\u2019s warrantless searches of the dog \u2014 the test results on the blood and feces and the records of the dog\u2019s weight \u2014 should be suppressed.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-4\">The state responded that the seizure of the dog was justified under the plain view exception to the warrant requirement. The state argued that the officer, having seen the dog in an emaciated state while lawfully in defendant\u2019s apartment, had probable cause to believe the dog had been neglected \u201cbased on his conversation with [defendant] about [how] she was apparently out of dog food and the citizen report at the outset.\u201d As to the veterinarian\u2019s actions once the dog was seized, the state responded that a dog \u201cis one thing itself\u2019 and \u201cdoesn\u2019t contain anything else other than more dog.\u201d With respect to the testing, the state argued that \u201c[s] imply doing testing on an object to confirm it is what law enforcement believes it is, is well recognized to not require a warrant or a separate justification for it.\u201d The state further argued that the state and federal constitutions only prohibit \u201cunreasonable\u201d searches and seizures, and it is reasonable for a veterinarian \u201cto provide medical care to a dog to determine what\u2019s wrong with it, to feed a dog, to do all of that.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b281-5\">The trial court denied defendant\u2019s suppression motion. The trial court concluded that defendant consented to the officer entering her residence, and the warrantless seizure of the dog was lawful because the officer had probable cause to believe that defendant had neglected the dog. The trial court determined that the veterinarian\u2019s actions\u2014 sampling and testing the blood and feces and recording the dog\u2019s weight \u2014 did not constitute a \u201csearch\u201d under Article I, section 9, or the Fourth Amendment. After the court denied defendant\u2019s suppression motion, a jury found defendant guilty of animal neglect in the second degree, ORS 167.325(1),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and the trial court sentenced defendant to one year of bench probation.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>On appeal, defendant reprises the arguments she made in the trial court under Article I, section 9, and the Fourth Amendment, challenging the warrantless seizure of the dog and arguing that the subsequent sampling and testing of the dog\u2019s blood and feces, as well as the recording of the dog\u2019s weight over several days, were warrantless searches. The state responds that there was no violation of either Article I, section 9, or the Fourth Amendment because the seizure was justified under the plain view exception to the warrant requirement, and the veterinarian did not conduct a search when she examined the dog. We review for errors of law. <em>State v. Ehly, </em>317 Or 66, 75, 854 P2d 421 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b282-4\">We begin with the officer\u2019s warrantless seizure of the dog under Article I, section 9. <em>See State v. Kennedy, </em>295 Or 260, 262, 666 P2d 1316 (1983) (court disposes of state constitutional claims before addressing federal constitutional claims). The parties agree that, when the officer removed defendant\u2019s dog from her home, he seized her personal property.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In other words, defendant had a possessory interest in the dog just as she did with other \u201ceffects,\u201d and the officer invaded that possessory interest. <em>See State v. Owens, </em>302 Or 196, 207, 729 P2d 524 (1986) (\u201cA \u2018seizure\u2019 occurs when there is a significant interference with a person\u2019s possessory or ownership interests in property.\u201d). Warrantless searches and seizures are <em>per se </em>unreasonable under Article I, section 9, unless they fall within \u201cone of the few specifically established and well-delineated exceptions to the warrant requirement.\u201d <em>State v. Davis, </em>295 Or 227, 237, 666 P2d 802 (1983) (internal quotation marks omitted). The state has the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>burden of demonstrating that the seizure was justified by an exception to the warrant requirement. <em>State v. Stevens, </em>311 Or 119, 126, 806 P2d 92 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b283-4\">As pertinent here, the \u201cplain view\u201d exception to the warrant requirement allows an officer to seize an object without a warrant if the officer encounters the object in plain view, while in a place where the officer is entitled to be, and the incriminating character of that object is immediately apparent. <em>State v. Currin, </em>258 Or App 715, 718-19, 311 P3d 903 (2013); <em>State v. Sargent, </em>323 Or 455, 463 n 5, 918 P2d 819 (1996) (stating that \u201cthe intrusion must be valid and it must be immediately apparent that the items [seized] are crime evidence\u201d). In this case, there is no dispute that, because defendant gave consent to the officer to enter her apartment, the officer observed the dog in plain view while in a place where he was entitled to be. <em>See, e.g., State v. Ford, </em>220 Or App 247, 252, 185 P3d 550 (2008) (concluding that, after the defendant consented to an officer\u2019s search of a dresser drawer, the officer could seize methamphetamine pipe that officer observed in the drawer).</p>\n<p id=\"b283-5\">The question here is whether the incriminating nature of the evidence was immediately apparent, that is, whether the police, upon seeing the dog, \u201chad probable cause to believe that [it] was either contraband or evidence of a crime.\u201d <em>State v. Carter, </em>342 Or 39, 45, 147 P3d 1151 (2006) (so stating, in the context of evidence discovered during execution of a search warrant). That standard is met, under Article I, section 9, when the police \u201csubjectively believe that a crime has been committed and thus that a person or thing is subject to seizure\u201d and that belief is \u201cobjectively reasonable in the circumstances.\u201d <em>Owens, </em>302 Or at 204.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-6\">Defendant contends that, when the officer saw the dog, it was not \u201cimmediately apparent\u201d to him that the dog had been neglected \u2014 in this case, not given enough food to maintain a healthy body weight \u2014 because \u201cthe officer could not determine for purposes of criminal prosecution whether the dog\u2019s condition was the result of criminal neglect or some other cause without having it tested by a veterinarian.\u201d In response, the state acknowledges that the officer \u201ccould not say with certainty that [the dog\u2019s] condition was caused by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>neglect without first ruling out medical explanations,\u201d but argues that the officer nonetheless had probable cause to believe that defendant had neglected the dog based on the totality of the circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-4\">We agree with the state. The officer saw the dog, in a near-emaciated condition, eating at random things in the yard and then attempting to vomit. Based on those observations, the officer thought that the dog \u201ccertainly appeared neglected\u201d and that there was a \u201cstrong possibility\u201d that the dog needed medical treatment. Although the dog\u2019s physical appearance might have been consistent with either neglect or illness, the officer had more to go on than the dog\u2019s emaciated appearance: The officer knew that a named informant had called the Humane Society to complain that defendant was not properly feeding her dog, and, when the officer asked defendant if she had any dog food, she admitted that she had run out of dog food. Those facts, taken together with the dog\u2019s appearance, support a reasonable belief that the dog was emaciated because defendant had failed to provide enough food for the dog to maintain a normal body weight, and, therefore, that the dog was evidence of a crime. <em>See, e.g., State v. Herbert, </em>302 Or 237, 242, 729 P2d 547 (1986) (concluding that police had probable cause to believe that an opaque paperfold contained contraband based on the paper-fold\u2019s appearance and shape along with \u201cadditional facts,\u201d such as the defendant\u2019s attempt \u201cto distract the officer while [he] furtively removed the paperfold from his pocket\u201d). That was all that was required for probable cause, even if more would be required to meet the standard for a conviction. <em>See, e.g., State v. Goodman, </em>328 Or 318, 326, 975 P2d 458 (1999) (\u201cProbable cause is not certainty; \u2018there is a vast difference between proof of probable cause and proof of guilt * * (quoting <em>State v. Tacker, </em>241 Or 597, 601, 407 P2d 851 (1965))). Accordingly, the trial court did not err in concluding that the officer\u2019s seizure of the dog was justified by the \u201cplain view\u201d exception to the warrant requirement under Article I, section 9.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b285-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>We turn to the question of whether the veterinarian conducted a \u201csearch\u201d of the dog under Article I, section 9, when she sampled and tested the dog\u2019s blood and feces and charted the dog\u2019s weight over several days.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> \u201cUnder Article I, section 9, a \u2018search\u2019 occurs when a government agent invades a protected privacy interest.\u201d <em>State v. Meredith, </em>337 Or 299, 303, 96 P3d 342 (2004). A protected privacy interest \u201cis not the privacy that one reasonably <em>expects </em>but the privacy to which one has a <em>right\u201d State v. Campbell, </em>306 Or 157, 164, 759 P2d 1040 (1988) (citation omitted; emphasis in original). We determine whether the government invaded a person\u2019s protected privacy interest by applying \u201can objective test of whether the government\u2019s conduct \u2018would significantly impair an individual\u2019s interest in freedom from scrutiny, <em>i.e., </em>his privacy.\u2019\u201d <em>State v. Wacker, </em>317 Or 419, 425, 856 P2d 1029 (1993) (quoting <em>State v. Dixson/Digby, </em>307 Or 195, 211, 766 P2d 1015 (1988)).</p>\n<p id=\"b285-4\">Defendant contends that she had \u201can interest in the privacy of the concealed information about her dog\u201d and that she retained that privacy interest even though the officer had seized the dog. According to defendant, the veterinarian\u2019s actions invaded her privacy interest by revealing that, \u201caside from being malnourished, the dog was healthy\u201d \u2014 information that was evidence of a crime because it \u201ctend[ed] to show that the dog\u2019s emaciation was the result of defendant\u2019s neglect.\u201d Specifically, defendant contends that the veterinarian conducted a \u201csearch\u201d by \u201csampling\u201d the dog\u2019s blood and feces, which defendant describes as requiring the \u201cphysical removal of material,\u201d and by \u201ctesting\u201d that material. Defendant further argues that weighing the dog and charting the dog\u2019s weight gain over time was a search because it \u201cprompt [ed] the dog\u2019s body to reveal information that would otherwise have remained concealed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b285-5\">The state responds with a categorical argument. The state starts with the premise that, \u201calthough [animals] are property in the eyes of the law, they have a statutory right to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>basic care separate and apart from their owners\u2019 possessory interests.\u201d The state points to the state statutes criminalizing animal mistreatment and to this court\u2019s determination that each animal identified in a count of animal neglect is a \u201cvictim\u201d of that crime for purposes of ORS 161.067(2), which provides that, when a person\u2019s repeated violation of a statute \u201cinvolves two or more victims, there are as many separately punishable offenses as there are victims.\u201d <em>See State v. Nix, </em>251 Or App 449, 461, 283 P3d 442 (2012), <em>rev allowed, </em>353 Or 410 (2013). Ultimately, the state argues that, \u201c[w]here the property rights of an animal owner conflict with the animal\u2019s right to be free from abuse and neglect, the animal\u2019s rights as a crime victim trump [.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b286-4\">We start with the state\u2019s argument, which is wholly separate from the privacy rights framework relied upon by defendant. Although the state\u2019s argument is broadly worded, we understand the state to contend that, when police lawfully seize an animal, the owner\u2019s privacy rights must yield to the animal\u2019s right to care, such that government actions consistent with veterinary treatment do not invade defendant\u2019s privacy rights.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> We cannot endorse that view. It is true, as the state maintains, that the legislature has criminalized the mistreatment of animals and, as a result, animals have statutory protections against abuse <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>and neglect. But it is also true that many animals, including the dog in this case, are the personal property of their owners. And although the animal abuse and neglect statutes impose certain limits on what owners can do with their property, those statutes do not \u2014 and cannot \u2014 by themselves justify a government actor\u2019s intrusion on the Article I, section 9, possessory and privacy rights of an animal owner. <em>Cf. State v. Fessenden, </em>258 Or App 639, 648-49, 310 P3d 1163, <em>rev allowed, </em>354 Or 597 (2013) (noting that \u201cthe legislature cannot dictate which law enforcement actions comport with constitutional requirements and which do not,\u201d but considering state statutes as helpful for the limited purpose of determining whether there was a \u201csocietal interest\u201d in emergency aid to animals under the judicially created emergency aid exception to the warrant requirement).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b287-4\">That animals are sentient beings unlike other property may explain the <em>statutory </em>protections that animals receive, and those protections may otherwise provide support for this court\u2019s conclusion in <em>Nix </em>that animals are \u201cvictims\u201d under ORS 161.067(2).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> But it does not follow \u2014 and we do not understand the state to argue \u2014 that those statutory protections have a constitutional dimension. We conclude that a person who owns an animal does not have diminished <em>constitutional </em>possessory and privacy rights with respect to that animal \u2014 personal property by statute and under Article I, section 9 \u2014 because the legislature has criminalized animal abuse and neglect.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-5\">The question remains whether any of the veterinarian\u2019s actions with respect to the dog invaded a protected <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>privacy interest of defendant. We start with the undisputed premise that the dog is defendant\u2019s personal property or, in constitutional terms, one of defendant\u2019s \u201ceffects.\u201d In a number of cases considering the examination of personal effects, we have held that government conduct that exposes information that is otherwise concealed or hidden in those effects impairs the owner\u2019s freedom from scrutiny. For example, in <em>State v. Portrey, </em>134 Or App 460, 896 P2d 7 (1995), the police had the defendant\u2019s implied consent to come onto his porch. Nonetheless, the court concluded that the police could not pick up the boots left on the porch and examine the soles \u2014 at least, so long as the observation of the boots did not give police probable cause to seize the boots \u2014 because the \u201cdefendant\u2019s privacy interest continued in the articles on his front porch that were not entirely visible to someone standing there.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 465. The court held that \u201c[t]hat action by police regarding <em>concealed personal effects </em>implicates constitutional guarantees.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 466 (emphasis added); <em>see also State v. Cardell, </em>180 Or App 104, 109, 41 P3d 1111 (2002) (concluding that, when an officer touched the tires of a parked car while he was lawfully present in a driveway, he conducted an \u201cillegal search and * * * the direct information that he <em>obtained </em>\u2014 i.e., that the tires were hot \u2014 should be excluded\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b288-4\">We are mindful, however, that the freedom from scrutiny provided by Article I, section 9, must be determined \u201cin light of the particular context in which the government conduct occurred.\u201d <em>Meredith, </em>337 Or at 306. Thus, although police who are lawfully present on a person\u2019s porch may not examine concealed personal effects, the same is not necessarily true once police have lawfully seized those personal effects. As the Supreme Court explained in <em>Owens, </em>\u201c[w]hen the police lawfully seize a container, they can thoroughly examine the container\u2019s exterior without violating any privacy interest of the owner or the person from whom the container was seized. <em>For example, the police can observe, feel, smell, shake and weigh it.\u201d </em>302 Or at 206 (emphasis added). When police have lawfully seized an object, then, government conduct that is coincident with their physical possession of the <em>object </em>\u2014 e.g., observing, touching, and even weighing the object \u2014 does not violate the privacy interest of the owner.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>That is not to say that a person\u2019s privacy interest is lost completely once her property is lawfully seized. Where police lawfully seized a pocketknife from a defendant during a search incident to arrest, for example, the police conducted a further \u201csearch\u201d when they opened the pocketknife to expose the blade because opening the knife revealed information that was not readily apparent when the pocketknife was closed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b289-4\">\u201cIn this case, to the extent that it \u2018announced\u2019 anything, [the] defendant\u2019s closed pocketknife announced only that it contained a blade. Nothing in the pocketknife\u2019s appearance gave the officers reason to believe that the blade contained residue from tire slashings. Because opening the knife revealed evidence that was not otherwise exposed to public view, it was a search that required probable cause.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b289-5\"><em>State v. Dickerson, </em>135 Or App 192, 195-96, 898 P2d 193 (1995); <em>see also State v.

Specifically, the tests revealed information about the dog\u2019s physiological condition, which, in turn, showed that the dog was healthy aside from being malnourished.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-4\">We acknowledge that animals are not simply repositories for their owners\u2019 information; animal owners do not typically use their animals to store or carry information like they would a briefcase or similar container. But in determining whether the police have invaded a defendant\u2019s privacy interest in her personal property, our analysis is not controlled by whether the item at issue \u2014 whether the soles of a pair of boots in <em>Portrey, </em>the pocketknife in <em>Dickerson, </em>or the tires in <em>Cardell </em>\u2014 is designed or used for the purpose of holding information. Nor, in that context, have we endeavored to assess whether the information that the examination revealed was particularly valuable to the item\u2019s owner or to society in general. Instead, what has driven our analysis is that the government actor engaged in \u201cadditional activity beyond that available to an ordinary observer * * * to obtain information\u201d that was not otherwise exposed. <em>State v. Haney, </em>153 Or App 642, 646, 958 P2d 192 (1998).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Accordingly, we conclude that the extraction and testing of the dog\u2019s blood implicates a privacy interest under Article I, section 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-5\">The same cannot be said as to defendant\u2019s separate claim that, after feeding the dog, the veterinarian invaded her privacy rights by weighing the dog every few days and recording the dog\u2019s weight gain. Defendant acknowledges that \u201csimply feeding the dog was not a search,\u201d but she contends that, like the extraction and testing of the dog\u2019s blood, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>weighing the dog over time \u201creveal [ed] information about the dog\u2019s health that would otherwise have remained concealed within its body.\u201d But the information that the weighing revealed \u2014 that the dog was gaining weight \u2014 would be apparent from the veterinarian\u2019s lawful observation of the dog.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Even if the dog\u2019s weight gain was more precisely measured by using a scale and recording the weight over time, that incremental intrusion beyond what was readily apparent to the veterinarian and those who had custody of the dog was not a \u201csearch\u201d under Article I, section 9. <em>See Owens, </em>302 Or at 206 (stating that weighing a lawfully seized container would not invade the owner\u2019s protected privacy interest).</p>\n<p id=\"b291-4\">In sum, we conclude that, although the officer\u2019s seizure of the dog was justified by the \u201cplain view\u201d exception to the warrant requirement, the veterinarian, acting on behalf of the state, conducted a warrantless search of the dog by extracting and testing its blood \u2014 an act that constituted a physical invasion of defendant\u2019s property and exposed otherwise concealed information about the dog that served as evidence of a crime. Because the state has not argued that the search of the dog was justified by an exception to the warrant requirement or that admission of the evidence was harmless,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> our analysis ends there. By extracting and testing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>the dog\u2019s blood, the state conducted a warrantless search of defendant\u2019s property in violation of defendant\u2019s Article I, section 9, rights, and evidence discovered as a result of that search should have been suppressed.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-4\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b279-6\"> In the trial court, defendant described the veterinary tests in a memorandum in support of her motion to suppress.

The officer\u2019s testimony at the suppression hearing suggests that the tests served a dual purpose \u2014 to gather evidence and to give medical treatment to the dog. The tests showed that the dog did not have a particular disease or infirmity, meaning that the dog was healthy apart from not being given adequate food. The tests were therefore helpful, as the officer put it, \u201cto make a determination if [he] was going to purse this criminally.\u201d But the tests also served as a tool for diagnosis in the course of treatment; in the words of the officer, those tests would \u201cdetermine what [was] wrong with [the dog.]\u201d In any event, we need not pinpoint the purpose or motivation for the testing because the state argues that there was no search \u201ceven if this court were to agree with defendant that the tests were run for purposes of gathering evidence of the crime of neglect.\u201d We therefore understand the state to argue that all that matters in weighing defendant\u2019s rights against the animal\u2019s statutory right to care is that the particular tests are consistent with the provision of veterinary care, even if they are also performed for the purpose of gathering evidence of a crime.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b287-6\"> The state has not argued that a warrant was excused here because of any emergency aid exception to the warrant requirement.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b287-7\"> In <em>Nix, </em>this court concluded that, for purposes of ORS 161.067(2), the victim of the offense of second-degree animal neglect was the animal itself, rather than the public at large or the owner. In reaching that conclusion, the court determined that, in enacting ORS 167.325, <em>\u201cthe legislature\u2019s </em>primary concern was to protect individual animals as sentient beings, rather than to vindicate a more generalized public interest in their welfare.\u201d 251 Or App at 461 (emphasis added). The court further concluded that, even though animals usually are the property of persons, the legislature \u201cdid not intend to protect the owners of animals when it enacted ORS 167.325,\u201d such that the owner of a neglected animal is the \u201cvictim\u201d of the crime of animal neglect. <em>Id. </em>at 458. This court\u2019s opinion in <em>Nix </em>answered a question of statutory interpretation and, in doing so, it explicitly noted that animals often have the status of personal property, without addressing an animal owner\u2019s constitutional rights with respect to animals as property.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b289-7\"> Defendant treats the sampling and testing of the dog\u2019s blood and feces as one in the same, but defendant acknowledges that it is unclear how the dog\u2019s fecal matter was collected by the veterinarian. Because the record provides only a limited factual description of the tests performed and gives no information about how the feces were collected, we cannot tell if the fecal matter was extracted as part of the search of the dog. Our conclusion that extracting and testing the blood was a search requires reversal in this case. If the prosecution of defendant is pursued on remand, the trial court should reassess whether the fecal matter evidence should be suppressed under the principles stated herein.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b290-6\"> In the trial court, the state argued that the testing of the dog\u2019s blood and feces was not a \u201csearch\u201d because it was akin to a confirmatory test on a substance to confirm the presence of drugs. <em>See Owens, </em>302 Or at 206 (\u201cWhen there is probable cause to believe that a lawfully seized substance is a controlled substance, a chemical test, for the sole purpose of determining whether or not it is a controlled substance, is neither a \u2018search\u2019 nor a \u2018seizure\u2019 under Article I, section 9.\u201d). Defendant responded that the tests on the dog\u2019s blood and feces here were \u201cmore invasive and intrusive ***. They did a full chemical workup on blood tests, fecal matter, everything. And * * * the conclusion that they drew is that there\u2019s nothing wrong with this dog. But the way that they drew that conclusion was by analyzing its body chemistry, basically.\u201d On appeal, the state does not again raise that argument, and, accordingly, we do not address it.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b291-5\"> Defendant does not make any independent argument that weighing the dog and charting its weight was a \u201csearch\u201d under the Fourth Amendment, apart from citing <em>U.

We reject defendant\u2019s Fourth Amendment argument as to the recording of the dog\u2019s weight without further discussion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b291-6\"> At oral argument on appeal, the state asserted that whatever privacy right defendant had in the dog, the search was reasonable under the circumstances. But the state \u2014 in its brief on appeal and in the proceedings in the trial court\u2014 never advanced any argument that the search in this case was reasonable under an established exception to the warrant requirement. (On appeal, defendant preemptively argued that the search did not qualify as an administrative search under Article I, section 9, but the state did not pursue that argument in its brief.) We note that the state also submitted a memorandum of additional authorities, citing <em>State ex rel Juv. Dept. v. M. A. D., </em>348 Or 381, 233 P3d 437 (2010), as a case where \u201cthe Oregon Supreme Court recognized a new exception to the warrant requirement for searches of school students.\u201d <em>See id. </em>at 394 (explaining that the rights of high school students against unreasonable intrusions by state officials, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>\u201clike the rights of a person searched pursuant to a valid officer-safety search, must yield if the state officials can point to specific and articulable facts that reasonably create a risk of immediate and serious harm to the officials or others\u201d). To the extent that the state presses for the recognition of a novel exception to the warrant requirement \u2014 such that a defendant\u2019s privacy rights must \u201cyield\u201d when a lawfully seized animal needs veterinary testing to satisfy some appropriate level of care \u2014 the state neither developed that argument on appeal nor presented that argument in the trial court.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
