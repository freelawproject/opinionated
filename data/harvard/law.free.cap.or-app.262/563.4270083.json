In this interlocutory appeal, the state assigns error to the trial court\u2019s pretrial order granting defendant\u2019s motion to suppress statements made during interviews with the police. The issue is whether, under ORS 136.425(1), Article I, section 12, of the Oregon Constitution, or the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution, defendant made his statements voluntarily. Under the state statute, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-5\">In reviewing the trial court\u2019s decision respecting the voluntariness of confessions and admissions, we accept the court\u2019s findings of fact if there is any evidence to support them. <em>State v. Goree, </em>151 Or App 621, 631, 950 P2d 919 (1997), <em>rev den, </em>327 Or 123 (1998). \u201cIf findings are not made on all such facts, and there is evidence from which such facts could be decided more than one way, we will presume that the facts were decided in a manner consistent with the ultimate conclusion, <em>e.g., </em>voluntariness or lack thereof, made by the trial court * * *.\u201d <em>Ball v. Gladden, </em>250 Or 485, 487, 443 P2d 621 (1968). Whether the facts found by the trial court are sufficient to sustain the trial court\u2019s ultimate conclusion regarding voluntariness is a question of law that we review for legal error. <em>Goree, </em>151 Or App at 631.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-6\">Defendant and Pelayo, brought their infant daughter, G, to the hospital after she was injured. An attending physician did not believe that the observed injuries could have been caused in the manner that the parents claimed. Detectives Hurley and Manus of the Portland Police Bureau came to the hospital. The detectives were told by medical personnel that the child had sustained bruising, a subdural hematoma on the back of her head, and was displaying elevated liver enzymes, a symptom sometimes associated with trauma. The child was intubated and was not breathing on her own when the detectives arrived. Based on what they had been told, the detectives were concerned that the child had been abused.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-7\">The detectives interviewed both parents, beginning with Pelayo. Hurley testified that defendant approached them after that interview and indicated his desire to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>discuss what had happened. That first interview took place in a hospital conference room with \u201cexterior and interior\u201d windows; the detectives were not wearing uniforms, wore badges clipped to their belts, and carried concealed firearms. Hurley testified that they informed defendant that he was not under arrest and told him that the interview was being recorded.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Defendant stated that he had been caring for G on the day in question and generally recounted what had happened on that day. He denied remembering any event that could account for G\u2019s injuries. At one point, detective Hurley stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b585-4\">\u201cI don\u2019t think you went home on Sunday and decided you were going to break your kid. That\u2019s not what I\u2019m here saying. But sometimes something will happen that explains the injury that\u2019s an accident. There\u2019s no crime involved. I get to write my report that says, \u2018This was an accident. It wasn\u2019t meant to be but it explains the injury on the child.\u2019\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b585-5\">After defendant replied that he couldn\u2019t remember anything that might have caused the injury, the detective continued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b585-6\">\u201c[HURLEY]: So let me tell you what type of injury this is. It\u2019s a head injury. It\u2019s a hematoma to the back of her head to her brain. Okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b585-7\">\u201c [DEFENDANT]: Right. That\u2019s what she told me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b585-8\">\u201c[HURLEY]: Bleeding back there \u2014 so the doctor explained?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b585-9\">\u201c [DEFENDANT]: Yeah. That\u2019s what [Pelayo] told me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b585-10\">\u201c[HURLEY]: Have you talked to the doctor, to Dr. Lanehart (ph)?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b585-11\">\u201c[DEFENDANT]: No. I haven\u2019t. I got here around\u2014 around 2:30.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b585-12\">\u201c[HURLEY]: Okay. So Dr. Lanehart is the doctor that has seen her and he is the one that\u2019s going to diagnose all her tests and do all that stuff. I\u2019ve spoken to Dr. Lanehart. He is a specialist for child abuse. That\u2019s specifically what he\u2019s called in on and that\u2019s what he was called in on this case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b586-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>\u201c [DEFENDANT]: Okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b586-4\">\u201c[HURLEY]: The type of injury that she has to the back of her head is a shaking injury. So if you pick up a kid and you shake them really bad\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b586-5\">\u201c[DEFENDANT]: Right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b586-6\">\u201c[HURLEY]: \u2014then they get hematomas on the front and the back. They actually \u2014 it\u2019ll\u2014it\u2019ll make them go blind. I mean it\u2019s a huge deal. Okay. If you pick up a baby and you shake them once because maybe they\u2019re crying or something has happened and you just kind of shake them once and their head pops back once, you can end up with a hematoma at the back of the head but it\u2019s not a shaking that causes lots of hematomas and serious brain damage.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b586-7\">After informing defendant further about the medical condition of G, Hurley told defendant that \u201c[s]omeone shook her. She got shaken.\u201d Hurley continued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b586-8\">\u201c [HURLEY]: You shake a baby hard enough and you\u2019re going to damage the front, the back and actually they\u2019ll go blind because you hematoma their eyes. She doesn\u2019t have that, but somebody shook her. Okay? This isn\u2019t a question of telling you that the only way that this happened was that somebody shook her. She didn\u2019t hit her head on something because there would be a bruise on the back of her head \u2014 \u25a0</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b586-9\">\u00ab* * * * =1=</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b586-10\">\u201c[HURLEY]: \u2014which there isn\u2019t. It\u2019s only internal damage. We have to figure out what happened as to who shook her. Okay? <em>If you tell me that you shook her on accident when you picked her up because you just picked her up too hard when you were playing with her, that\u2019s fine. Then that </em>\u2014 then <em>that\u2019s what happened and there\u2019s my story. But I need to know that because if I can\u2019t figure out what happened to her, then my assumption is going to have to be child abuse. </em>Okay. That\u2019s- \u2014 -because that\u2019s how it works. We <em>have to have an explanation. </em>Whether it be an accident explanation or T didn\u2019t like my kid today and I decided to hurt my child today.\u2019\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b586-11\">(Emphasis added.) Defendant then stated that perhaps the injury had occurred when he picked G up too quickly after changing her. That first interview lasted approximately 45 minutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>At the suppression hearing, Hurley testified that defendant reapproached the detectives and stated that he now remembered tossing G up in the air and suggested that perhaps this had caused the injury. The detectives commenced a second recorded interview, which began approximately one hour after the conclusion of the first and took place in the same hospital conference room. Defendant described playfully tossing his daughter up in the air and catching her; the recorded portion of that second interview lasted approximately 17 minutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-4\">On the next day, the detectives approached defendant at the hospital and asked him to come to another interview in a different hospital conference room. By that point, the detectives believed that defendant had caused the injuries to G. That third interview began with detective Manus describing certain medical details of those injuries:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b587-5\">\u201c [MANUS]: Were you able to hear about what the doctors told your family, what tests she\u2019s had today, anything like that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b587-6\">\u201c[DEFENDANT]: Well, the only tests that we had is her eye test and her body [scan.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b587-7\"><em>* </em>\u2021 *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b587-8\">\u201c[MANUS]: Did you hear how that went or what the results were?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b587-9\">\u201c[DEFENDANT]: No. Just [Pelayo] text[ed] me, \u2018Oh, she just got done with this test, and she just got done with that test.\u2019 That\u2019s it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b587-10\">\u00ab* * * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b587-11\">\u201c[MANUS]: *** Well, here\u2019s what we found out. So they did find some hemorrhaging behind [G\u2019s] left eye which also goes along with the bleed to the back of her head that just confirms how that happened to her. The fact that she\u2019s got the bleeding behind her left eye just shows that it was a very deliberate, quick, violent shake. It happened because she was shaken. They also did the body scan and most everything looks fine.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b588-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>\u201c [DEFENDANT]: No broken bones or anything?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b588-4\">\u201c[MANUS]: Not that they\u2019re seeing yet. That doesn\u2019t mean that there aren\u2019t any broken bones and two weeks from now they could see some of the healing and then they can see, oh, there was some fractures in there that have healed and that\u2019s when they can tell. Okay. But right now, it looks okay. And obviously our main concern is [G] because doctors are trying to figure out kind of how to treat her, what\u2019s going on with her. Obviously, they know that she\u2019s had the brain trauma. She\u2019s had some elevated liver counts, let me get the right organ. And they\u2019re not really sure if that\u2019s related to the trauma that caused her brain injury or if there\u2019s something else going on. Okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b588-5\">\u201c[DEFENDANT]: So regardless the infection supposedly the doctors told us at the beginning.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b588-6\">\u201c[MANUS]: No. They don\u2019t \u2014 they don\u2019t believe so. That\u2019s kind of where some of the mystery is with the liver count. They have determined she doesn\u2019t have a urinary infection. They think that was probably a bad test done at Portland Adventist. So they have ruled that out. But they are, you know, kind of concerned because she still has a fever. She\u2019s still throwing up which is indicative of brain injury and then they\u2019ve got these elevated liver counts. * * * [W]hatever happened to her to cause that brain bleed could explain the liver issue or we can find out how that happened and say, okay, the liver issue is separate. We need to look into that and treat it differently. Do you know what I\u2019m saying?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b588-7\">Manus also stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b588-8\">\u201cAnd so somewhere in that time when she was fine * * * to Sunday evening something happened to her. And we need to know why for several reasons. Mainly, because the doctors want to give her the best possible care. Okay? You know, we\u2019re finding more results from these tests. In order for them to know exactly what happened, it can help determine * * * are there going to be other injuries that we need to look at. Like I said, is the liver issue something that\u2019s going to correlate to what happened to her for the brain?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b588-9\">Defendant continued to deny having deliberately harmed G, and stated again that the injury must have happened when <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>he playfully threw the child up in the air. Manus repeatedly cast doubt on defendant\u2019s version of events. Detective Hurley then took over:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b589-4\">\u201c [HURLEY]: This is a point in time in this case where you need to step up and tell me what happened to your daughter. I don\u2019t care about you right now or your wife right now. What I care about is your daughter. Your daughter has a significant brain injury that is bleeding in her head. She has significant trauma behind one of her eyes that she\u2019s lucky isn\u2019t going to cause blindness but may cause issues with her sight. She has a trauma to her liver that is causing high enzyme level in her body. If we knew exactly what happened to her to cause the head trauma, we can decide whether or not the liver enzymes are or are not, in fact, related to the head trauma. If they are not, * * * then they need to be treated differently than if they are related to the head trauma. Do you understand what I\u2019m saying?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b589-5\">\u201c[DEFENDANT]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b589-6\">\u201c[MANUS]: So the only way for us to know that is to know what happened to your daughter. I don\u2019t know what happened to your daughter. You know and [G] knows and [G] can\u2019t talk to me and she can\u2019t tell me. Okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b589-7\">\u201c[DEFENDANT]: Yeah.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b589-8\">\u201c[HURLEY]: But you are her father. Your job in your life, and I know you know this\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b589-9\">\u201c[DEFENDANT]: Yeah.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b589-10\">\u201c [HURLEY]: \u2014is to protect your daughter.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b589-11\">\u201c[DEFENDANT]: Okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b589-12\">\u201c[HURLEY]: Your job is to make sure that she is happy and healthy and safe and that she knows her Lord as she is \u2014 as she is raised and you have done that. You\u2019ve done a good job doing that. Okay. I also understand that you and [Pelayo] are concerned about having your child taken away from you. You\u2019re concerned about having your own welfare about what\u2019s going to happen if you tell me what you did that was a mistake at some point in time that happened on Sunday. I don\u2019t think you deliberately hurt your child. I <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>don\u2019t think you would. But I do think something happened that was an accident that caused this brain injury. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b590-4\">\u201c* * * <em>You were the only one that was with her. You were the only one that would know. She cannot do this to herself. She cannot crawl away and right now [G] needs you, she needs you to be stepping up as her father to tell me what happened so they can get her the medical care that she needs. This is not a minor injury. This isn\u2019t a boo-boo. And you are the only one at this point in time that can help her. I need you to do that and tell me what happened on Sunday. </em>You know what happened. I can see in your face that you know what happened. You just need to tell me\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b590-5\"># \u2021 jfc \u2021</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b590-6\">\u201c[HURLEY]: I know you have a lot of things going through your head right now and a lot of concerns, but I really need you to step back from those and put [G] first. Okay. <em>I need you [to] tell me what happened to her so that I know what medical care she needs. If- </em>\u2014 if <em>the head trauma doesn\u2019t have anything to do with the liver issues, then we need to know that. But I can\u2019t know that until I know how the head trauma happened. And if the liver is related to the head trauma then it may all work out on its own and it doesn\u2019t need extra medication or different care, but if the liver </em>is\u2014 <em>has got elevated counts because of something separate, some sort of disorder or infection, whatever, I need to know that. </em>* * * <em>Livers can get elevated based on a head trauma. They can depending on how the head trauma occurred. But I can\u2019t know that if I don\u2019t know how the head trauma occurred.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b590-7\">\u201cI am not here to tell you that you are a bad parent because you\u2019re not. I\u2019ve actually already talked to the District Attorney about this case. Okay. I think you guys are good people.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b590-8\">\u201c[DEFENDANT]: (Inaudible.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b590-9\">\u201c[HURLEY]: I really do. I like your in-laws, your mother-in-law is a really nice gal. She seems to really care about [G] and about helping you guys out to make sure that she\u2019s raised well and I think she did a good job. You step up and take care of your [other daughter] as well as taking care of your daughter here. You\u2019re a good dad. Okay. And I \u2014 I can\u2019t imagine being in your position. I can\u2019t. Because you \u2014 you know what happened and you need to tell me that but there\u2019s also this self-preservation part of not wanting to get yourself in trouble or causing more issues and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>I understand that. I do. But again, and I \u2014 and I say this with all of my heart, you need to step up and be the father right now and protect your daughter. What happened?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b591-4\">(Emphasis added.) Defendant continued to deny having any additional knowledge about what could have caused G\u2019s injuries; the detectives continued to insist that he did. After more questioning, the detectives eventually asked defendant to submit to a polygraph examination. After the detectives generally explained the procedures associated with that examination, defendant agreed to submit to one later that week. At the conclusion of that explanation, defendant asked, \u201cSo after all this are we \u2014 is this case going to court, or something?\u201d Hurley replied, \u201cNo, not necessarily. Right now what\u2019s probably going to happen with this case is \u2014 so first [of] all let\u2019s \u2014 [.]\u201d At that point, the detectives turned off the tape recorder.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b591-5\">At the motion to suppress hearing, the state asked Hurley what happened after the recording ended. She explained that she told the defendant that the case \u201cwill go to the [district attorney] and make a determination [sic] of whether they think it\u2019s enough to charge somebody with a crime, but that wasn\u2019t a decision we could make at that time based on the information that we had.\u201d Hurley also stated that, she thought that she had asked defendant if he had any questions, explained that the investigation was not over, informed him of her belief that he knew what had happened to G, and told him to call her when he was willing to tell her what had happened. Hurley testified that the officers had packed up to leave and were headed for the door when defendant put his head down and said, \u201cT have something to say.\u2019\u201d He then told the detectives that he had shaken G because he was upset about the disorderly state of the house. That initial confession was not recorded; when defendant was finished confessing, the detectives pulled out the recording equipment and had defendant repeat his statements. There was a 25-minute gap between the end of the prior recording and the start of the one that captured defendant\u2019s confession.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>The trial court ordered defendant\u2019s statements suppressed.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> At the conclusion of the hearing, the court identified several different statements of the officers that \u201cjump out at me\u201d and then stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b592-4\">\u201cHere was a man who had a baby in the hospital for shaken baby syndrome or some traumatic issue. Several times during the discussion with him he was asked to tell the truth because that would predicate what the treatment would be for the baby. Implicit in that is if he didn\u2019t, the baby was going to end up worse off.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b592-5\">\u201cI see that as compelling. I see the going back and forth by saying \u2014 minimizing to the defendant what\u2019s going to happen to him if he [comes] clean and he confesses. I believe that the statements, given these facts and circumstances, were involuntarily made, and that\u2019s based on the totality of circumstances. There\u2019s no one thing that jumps out at me but there are a lot of things that together tell me that his will was overborne by two detectives in that hospital room over two days.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b592-6\">This interlocutory appeal followed. <em>See </em>ORS 138.060(l)(c). The state\u2019s sole contention is that the trial court erred in concluding that defendant\u2019s statements to the detectives were made involuntarily.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-7\">Before analyzing the state or federal constitutional issues, we must begin with the standards for voluntariness under state law, specifically with ORS 136.425(1), which provides, \u201cA confession or admission of a defendant * * * cannot be given in evidence against the defendant when it was made under the influence of fear produced by threats.\u201d <em>See State v. Foster, </em>303 Or 518, 526, 739 P2d 1032 (1987) (appellate courts consider statutory issues before state or federal constitutional issues). The state urges that the standards under the statute and Article I, section 12, of the Oregon Constitution do not differ in any respect that bears on this case; defendant does not argue otherwise. In the absence of arguments to the contrary, and consistently with our case <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>law on the issue, we proceed with that understanding. <em>See State v. Pollard, </em>132 Or App 538, 888 P2d 1054, <em>rev den, </em>321 Or 138 (1995); <em>Goree, </em>151 Or App at 630, 630 n 1. \u201cIn Oregon, a confession is initially deemed involuntary. Before a confession can be received in evidence, the state must show that it was voluntarily given, that is, made without inducement through fear or promises, direct or implied.\u201d <em>State v. Mendacino, </em>288 Or 231, 235, 603 P2d 1376 (1979) (internal citation omitted). \u201cThe test for voluntariness under Article I, section 12, of the Oregon Constitution is whether, under the totality of the circumstances, the waiver of rights and the confession were the product of an essentially free, unconstrained and informed choice or whether the accused\u2019s capacity for self-determination was critically impaired.\u201d <em>State v. Burks, </em>107 Or App 588, 592, 813 P2d 1071, <em>rev den, </em>312 Or 151 (1991). \u201c[T]he key to the \u2018free and voluntary\u2019 character of the confession is the inducement made to the defendant\u2014 was there any promise or threat made to the defendant which would elicit a false confession[.]\u201d <em>State v. Smith, </em>301 Or 681, 693, 725 P2d 894 (1986); <em>see State v. Powell, </em>352 Or 210, 218, 282 P3d 845 (2012) (stating that ORS 136.425 \u201cencompasses the common law and thus applies to confessions induced by promises of leniency as well as by threats\u201d). The state must prove voluntariness by a preponderance of the evidence. <em>State v. Stevens, </em>311 Or 119, 137, 806 P2d 92 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b593-3\">In a reflection of the two concerns identified by the trial court, the parties focus on two issues: the officers\u2019 assertions that the medical care received by defendant\u2019s daughter would suffer if he did not confess, and the notion that he was induced to confess by an implied promise of leniency. The state contends that the officers did not improperly threaten to withhold medical care from G, and that defendant could not have reasonably understood them to have done so; it also urges that there was no promise of immunity or leniency. Defendant does not maintain that the officers threatened to withhold medical care from G, but instead argues that the officers exploited his daughter\u2019s need for medical treatment as a means of pressuring him to confess. We stress that a conclusion favorable to state on either line of argument does not inexorably lead to the conclusion that the state has met <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>its burden of showing voluntariness; instead, and as the trial court properly recognized, the test considers the totality of the circumstances. <em>Goree, </em>151 Or App at 631.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-4\">We begin with the issue of G\u2019s medical care; at the outset we state our agreement with the parties that the record cannot reasonably be read to reveal that the officers threatened to withhold medical care from G in the absence of a confession, and we do not perceive that the trial court so concluded. What the officers did do, however, was cultivate and leverage defendant\u2019s fear that, unless he admitted to shaking her, G\u2019s medical care would suffer. The state argues that accurately informing a defendant of the consequences of his refusal to cooperate is permissible, citing <em>State v. Hovater, </em>42 Or App 13, 16, 599 P2d 1222 (1979) (advising a defendant of the \u201cserious consequences\u201d of a conviction, including being separated from his children, did not vitiate the voluntariness of his confession). That may be so, but what happened here was not merely pointing out the seriousness of G\u2019s situation or informing defendant of the natural consequences of withholding information about how G may have been injured. Instead, the officers informed defendant that the way to help his infant daughter was to tell them that <em>he had accidentally shaken her. </em>At the outset of the third interview, the officers learned \u2014 in response to their question on the subject \u2014 that defendant had not talked to the doctors about G\u2019s condition. The officers then explained that they had talked to the doctors; they emphasized the severity of G\u2019s injuries, including that she had \u201csignificant trauma,\u201d a \u201csignificant brain injury,\u201d \u201cbleeding in her head,\u201d and may have vision problems; they then suggested \u2014 if not outright stated \u2014 that G\u2019s medical care would be dictated by what defendant told them. Having made clear that G had serious medical issues that could be ameliorated by a confession\u2014 an assertion that, as a matter of medical fact, is without any support in the record<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> \u2014 the officers also appealed to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>defendant\u2019s paternal responsibilities, his religion, stated that defendant was the <em>only </em>one who could help G, and stated, in effect, that the way to provide that help was to tell the officers that he had accidently shaken her.* *5 Those statements, taken in the circumstances in which they were made, constituted an \u201cinducement through *** fear\u201d that was specifically calculated to capitalize on what the trial court recognized as defendant\u2019s acute vulnerability. <em>State v. Benton, </em>92 Or App 685, 689, 759 P2d 332 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b595-4\">Defendant urges that the conduct described above was sufficient on its own to render his subsequent confession involuntary. We need not decide whether that is the case however, because that was not the only form of inducement that the officers brought to bear on defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-5\">On this point, the groundwork was laid early on by Hurley, when she stated that she did not believe that defendant meant to \u201cbreak your kid,\u201d but that sometimes accidents happen and \u201c[t] here\u2019s no crime involved. I get to write my report that says, \u2018This was an accident. It wasn\u2019t meant to be but it explains the injury on the child.\u2019\u201d Hurley later stated, \u201cWe <em>have to have an explanation. </em>Whether it be an accident explanation or T didn\u2019t like my kid today and I decided to hurt my child today.\u2019\u201d (Emphasis added.) Hurley also stated that, if defendant told her that he shook G \u201con accident,\u201d she would accept that answer (\u201cthen that\u2019s what happened and there\u2019s my story\u201d); she also stated that, if defendant did not tell her that he shook G, the officers would assume that the child had been abused.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-6\">When Hurley stated \u201cwe have to have an explanation,\u201d a stark choice was put to defendant: either confess to accidentally shaking G and \u2014 in addition to securing better medical care \u2014 the officers would accept that version of events, or do not confess, and allow the officers to assume that the child had been abused. Whatever abstract legal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number>distinction might exist between accidentally injuring a child while shaking the child and \u201cchild abuse\u201d is of no moment; the obvious intent in drawing a distinction between the two alternatives was to induce defendant to confess to less-serious conduct than it would be assumed that he had committed in the absence of a confession. That the officers never explicitly made a promise of leniency or immunity is not dis-positive; the effect of their approach was to tell defendant: \u201cthe only way to avoid having the police conclude that you are a child abuser is to tell us that you accidentally shook your daughter.\u201d <em>See Pollard, </em>132 Or App at 544 (\u201c\u2018The precise form of words in which the inducement is presented to the prisoner\u2019s mind is immaterial. It is sufficient if they convey to him the idea of temporal benefit or disadvantage, and his confession follows in consequence of the hopes thereby excited.\u2019\u201d (Quoting <em>State v. Wintzingerode, 9 </em>Or 153, 163 (1881).)).</p>\n<p id=\"b596-4\">On a related note, the trial court specifically identified the moment when the third recording ended \u2014 that is, right after the officers told defendant that the case was not \u201cnecessarily\u201d going to result in a criminal case \u2014 as central to its conclusion. <em>See </em>262 Or App at 571, 571 n 2. Although the trial court did not make any explicit factual findings about what transpired in the 25-minute unrecorded interval between the end of the third recording and defendant\u2019s confession, we are required to assume that the trial court found the facts \u201cin a manner consistent with the ultimate conclusion.\u201d <em>Ball, </em>250 Or at 487.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-5\">Again, we do not decide whether either line of police conduct, standing alone, would represent an insurmountable obstacle to the state\u2019s effort to show that the statements were made voluntarily. When the inducements discussed above are taken in view of each other and the totality of the underlying circumstances of the interviews, we conclude that the trial court did not err in concluding that the statements were made involuntarily.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b585-15\"> Excerpts of the recordings were played at the hearing on the motion to suppress and appear in the trial court transcript. A transcript of the recordings was also entered into evidence; the quoted material in this opinion is taken from the latter source.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b591-6\"> The trial court specifically referred to this moment in the interview as supporting its conclusion, noting that the officer \u201cinterrupted and it was over, and the next thing we have is a confession.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b592-8\"> The trial court did not specifically identify the statements that were subject to suppression. It seems apparent on the record, however, that the trial court referred to those statements constituting defendant\u2019s admission and any subsequent statements that were derived from that admission. We proceed under that assumption.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b594-5\"> There was not, for instance, any suggestion that the doctors did not know the full extent of G\u2019s injuries; on the contrary, the officers repeatedly stated that they knew, from talking to the doctors, that G had been shaken, <em>viz., </em>the cause of the injuries. We are aware that defendant might have, in circumstances more conducive to contemplation, realized that whether he confessed could not logically bear on the treatment his daughter received. Nonetheless, the trial court identified the fact that defendant told the officers that he was \u201cstressing\u201d as important <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>to its conclusion and suggested that officers had \u201cexploited the vulnerability of the defendant.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b595-9\"> At various points, the officers told defendant: \u201csomeone shook her\u201d; \u201cyou were the only one that would know\u201d; \u201cyou are the only one that can help her\u201d; \u201cI need you [to] tell me what happened to her so that I know what medical care she needs.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
