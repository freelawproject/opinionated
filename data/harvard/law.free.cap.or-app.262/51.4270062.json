He contends that the court erred in denying part of the relief requested in his motion to modify the judgment. We conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying the relief in question and, therefore, affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-5\">In 2002, following a jury trial, the trial court entered a judgment convicting defendant of one count of first-degree assault and two counts of first-degree robbery. On the assault conviction, the trial court imposed an upward departure sentence of 180 months and, with respect to the robbery convictions, the court imposed sentences of 90 months under ORS 137.700.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> This court affirmed the judgment without opinion. <em>State v. Lewallen, </em>189 Or App 492, 76 P3d 690 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b72-6\">In 2010, defendant filed a motion to modify the judgment pursuant to ORS 137.754 and ORS 138.083.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Defendant requested that the court (1) modify the judgment to expressly state that he was eligible for sentence-modification programs, (2) merge the two robbery convictions into a single conviction, and (3) modify the departure sentence for the assault \u2014 which was based on findings made by the court \u2014 by either imposing the presumptive sentence or empanelling a sentencing jury if the state \u201cs [ought] reinstatement of the aggravated departure\u201d sentence. <em>See generally Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 US 296, 124 S Ct 2531, 159 L Ed 2d 403 (2004) (trial court\u2019s imposition of an upward departure sentence on the basis of findings by the sentencing court violated the defendant\u2019s right to trial by jury). The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>state did not oppose amending the judgment to state that defendant was eligible for sentence-modification programs and to merge the robbery convictions. However, it contended that defendant\u2019s request regarding the departure sentence should be denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-4\">The court held a hearing on the motion in February 2011. At the end of the hearing, the court stated that, \u201cbecause the State is not objecting,\u201d it would grant two of defendant\u2019s requests: the judgment would \u201cbe modified to reflect unambiguously that [defendant was] eligible for sentence modifications programs\u201d and, as to the robbery convictions, the court stated that it would \u201cmodify the judgment to merge those two, so [defendant did not] end up with two separate convictions.\u201d As to defendant\u2019s assertion regarding the departure sentence, the court expressed that it was \u201cpretty skeptical.\u201d However, it took the matter under advisement to \u201cspend a little more time with [it after having] heard the arguments of the attorneys.\u201d The court later issued an order granting the motion as stated at the hearing, but denying the motion to \u201cvacate the imposition of a departure sentence based on aggravating factors\u201d on the assault charge. Accordingly, the court entered a modified judgment that merged the robbery convictions and stated that \u201cdefendant is eligible for sentence modification programs, pursuant to ORS 137.754 after the service of 90 months.\u201d (Emphasis and boldface omitted.) However, the judgment retained the provision from the earlier judgment that, based on findings made by the court, defendant would serve a departure sentence of 180 months on the assault conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-5\">Defendant appeals from that judgment. On appeal, he asserts that the trial court erred in denying \u201cthat part of his motion to modify that sought correction of the aggravated-departure sentence on [the assault charge], which the court based on non-juried factors.\u201d The state first responds that this \u201ccourt lacks authority to review defendant\u2019s claim\u201d of error. (Boldface omitted.) In particular, the state contends that the only potential basis for review in this case is ORS 138.222(4)(a), which provides that the appellate court may review a claim that \u201c[t]he sentencing court failed to comply with the requirements of law in imposing or failing to impose a sentence.\u201d According to the state, however, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>that provision does not authorize review, because denial of a motion pursuant to ORS 138.083 \u201ccannot be characterized as a failure to comply with the requirements of law in imposing or failing to impose a sentence, because this is not a sentencing and a trial court is not required to do anything.\u201d (Emphasis omitted.) However, we concluded otherwise in <em>State v. Harding, </em>222 Or App 415, 420, 193 P3d 1055 (2008), <em>adh\u2019d to on recons, </em>225 Or App 386, 202 P3d 181, <em>vac\u2019d on other grounds, </em>347 Or 368, 223 P3d 1029 (2009). In that case, as here, the defendant, pursuant to ORS 138.083, had moved for a corrected judgment. He asserted that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b74-4\">\u201c(1) [t]he judgment erroneously failed to include language indicating that defendant could be considered for alternative programs pursuant to ORS 137.750 during a portion of one of his sentences, and (2) the judgment erroneously imposed an upward departure sentence * * * on the basis of findings made by the court * * * \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b74-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 417. The trial court granted relief on the first basis only, and the defendant appealed. On appeal, he asserted that the \u201ctrial court erred in failing to correct the erroneous departure sentence,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 418, and the state responded, in part, that the assignment of error was \u201cnot reviewable, because it is not a claim that the \u2018sentencing court failed to comply with requirements of law in imposing or failing to impose a sentence,\u2019\u201d <em>id. </em>at 420 (quoting ORS 138.222(4)(a)). We noted that the state\u2019s contention was \u201csquarely at odds with our prior case law interpreting\u201d ORS 138.222(4)(a) and observed that we had \u201crecently reiterated the broad scope of sentencing errors that may be reviewed under ORS 138.222(4)(a).\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>State v. Arnold, </em>214 Or App 201, 164 P3d 334 (2007)). In short, we concluded in <em>Harding </em>that the defendant\u2019s argument that the trial court erred in failing to correct an erroneous departure sentence pursuant to ORS 138.083 was reviewable on appeal: It \u201cfalls squarely within the ambit of the types of error that we have reviewed regularly under ORS 138.222(4)(a).\u201d <em>Id. </em>Based on our reasoning in <em>Harding, </em>we reject the state\u2019s assertion that defendant\u2019s assignment of error in this case is not reviewable pursuant to ORS 138.222.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-6\">On the merits, defendant contends that the trial court erred in failing to grant his motion to modify the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>judgment with respect to the \u201cunconstitutional, non-juried aggravated departure.\u201d In his view, the court had no discretion with respect to the relief requested, but was \u201crequired to take corrective action.\u201d The state responds that ORS 138.083 \u201cgrants discretionary authority to the trial court,\u201d but imposes no requirement that a trial court grant a motion pursuant to the statute: \u201cORS 138.083 provides that a trial court \u2018may\u2019 correct the error. The statute makes <em>all </em>of these decisions discretionary, not mandatory ***.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) The state is correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-4\">First, as the state points out, under ORS 138.083 (l)(a), the court \u201cmay correct the judgment\u201d to modify an erroneous term. In other words, the statute\u2019s text gives the trial court discretion. As we explained in <em>State v. Engerseth, </em>255 Or App 765, 768 n 4, 299 P3d 567, <em>rev den, </em>353 Or 868 (2013),</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b75-5\">\u201cin a motion to correct a judgment pursuant to ORS 138.083(l)(a), a party may raise issues concerning an erroneous term in the judgment, including issues that could have been raised about that error but were not raised before entry of the original judgment. <em>The court, however, has discretion to determine whether to correct the judgment based on those arguments, and, on appeal, we review the trial court\u2019s decision for an abuse of discretion.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b75-6\">(Emphasis added.) <em>See also Harding, </em>222 Or App at 421 (given the \u201cdiscretionary nature of the trial court\u2019s error-modification authority under ORS 138.083, the trial court was not required to correct the asserted error\u201d in imposing an upward departure sentence on the basis of findings by the trial court).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Accordingly, contrary to defendant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>contention, the trial court was not required to correct the judgment; rather, it had discretion to determine whether or not to correct the judgment, and we review its decision for abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-4\">Defendant asserts, nevertheless, that the court abused its discretion in this case. In particular, he asserts that, because its order does not reflect the basis for the court\u2019s denial of his request, we should conclude that the court abused its discretion. The state points out that the court had \u201cdiscretion to deny a motion to correct an alleged <em>Blakely </em>error without holding a hearing\u201d and asserts that the court \u201ccertainly acts within its discretion if \u2014 as here \u2014 it denies the motion after holding a hearing, listening to arguments from both sides, engaging the parties on the issue, and then delaying its decision to consider the matter further.\u201d In determining whether the trial court abused its discretion, \u201cwe will reverse only if a trial court\u2019s discretionary determination is not a legally permissible one.\u201d <em>Sjomeling v. Lasser, </em>251 Or App 172, 187, 285 P3d 1116, <em>rev den, </em>353 Or 103 (2012); <em>see also State v. Rogers, </em>330 Or 282, 312, 4 P3d 1261 (2000) (abuse of discretion means that the court\u2019s action or decision was not \u201cwithin the range of legally correct discretionary choices\u201d and did not result in a \u201cpermissible, legally correct outcome\u201d); <em>State v. G. N., </em>230 Or App 249, 255, 215 P3d 902 (2009) (one test for evaluating whether a court has abused its discretion is whether the decision was clearly against reason and evidence). Applying that standard here, we agree with the state that, even assuming that the departure sentence in this case was an erroneous term in the judgment and that ORS 138.083(1)(a) authorizes the relief sought by defendant, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying defendant\u2019s request to modify the departure sentence in this case. <em>See Harding, </em>222 Or App at 422 n 5 (expressing \u201cno opinion as to whether such relief\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>of empanelling a jury to make the relevant factual findings \u201cwould be available in a proceeding under ORS 138.083\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b77-4\">As the state points out, in the reconsideration opinion in <em>Harding, </em>we observed that nothing \u201cin our prior decision or in the text of ORS 138.083 * * * would require trial courts to hold hearings in order to deny motions filed pursuant to that statute.\u201d 225 Or App at 391 (emphasis omitted). Furthermore, in response to the state\u2019s concern that \u201cour opinion \u2018could open the floodgates\u2019 to hundreds, nay thousands, of potential litigants,\u201d we emphasized that a \u201ctrial court\u2019s ability to correct asserted errors under ORS 138.083 is highly discretionary\u201d and that there are \u201cnumerous reasons why a trial court, in its discretion, might well choose <em>not </em>to grant a defendant\u2019s motion to correct the type of\u2018erroneous term\u2019 asserted.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b77-5\">Here, the trial court held a hearing on defendant\u2019s motion and, in response to defendant\u2019s contentions at the hearing, expressed concern about finality and opening the \u201cfloodgates.\u201d The court stated that it was \u201cshaking my head at the idea that all of these defendants are going to come back and get jury trials anew.\u201d It also noted that defendant\u2019s case had been serious and that the court had made a good record for the reasons for departing. Furthermore, the court observed that it was</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b77-6\">\u201ctrying to think about all of these trials that would be commenced almost a decade later for purposes of convening a jury to hear as much testimony as might be available to redetermine this one issue. And the fact is, you know, when is that going to play out to its logical conclusions? What if he had gotten a 40-year sentence? * * * I mean, you\u2019re just going to be making the same argument no matter what.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b77-7\">After hearing both parties\u2019 arguments, the court stated that it was \u201cpretty skeptical\u201d with respect to defendant\u2019s motion to modify the departure sentence. However, it took that matter under advisement to \u201cspend a little more time with this now that I\u2019ve heard the arguments of the attorneys.\u201d All of those considerations were appropriate for the court to take into account in determining whether to exercise its discretion to grant the requested relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>In view of the highly discretionary nature of the court\u2019s error modification authority pursuant to ORS 138.083, we cannot say that the court abused its discretion in denying relief. The court held a hearing, listened to argument from both sides, engaged the parties on the issue in question, and expressed appropriate concerns about finality, the age of the case, the difficulty in empanelling a new jury, and the strength of the record on the departure findings. Under the circumstances here, the court\u2019s ultimate decision to deny the relief in question was legally permissible; that is, it was within the range of legally correct discretionary choices. Accordingly, the trial court did not err.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b72-7\"> Under ORS 137.700, the crimes of first-degree assault and first-degree robbery are each subject to a mandatory minimum sentence of 90 months. In this case, the court imposed the 90-month robbery sentences concurrent to each other and consecutive to the 180-month assault sentence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b72-8\"> Under ORS 138.083(l)(a),</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b72-9\">\u201c[t]he sentencing court retains authority irrespective of any notice of appeal after entry of judgment of conviction to modify its judgment and sentence to correct any arithmetic or clerical errors or to delete or modify any erroneous term in the judgment. The court may correct the judgment either on the motion of one of the parties or on the court\u2019s own motion after written notice to all the parties.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b75-7\"> We note that defendant asserts that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b75-8\">\u201cthe rationale for the <em>Harding </em>court\u2019s conclusion that the trial court had discretion to but was not required to correct the asserted * * * error, was that * * * Harding sought outright deletion of the departure sentence and imposition of a presumptive sentence' \u2014 a remedy that would be broader than the relief that would be available on remand to a defendant who asserted a meritorious <em>Blakely </em>challenge to a sentence on appeal.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b75-9\">(Internal quotation marks and citation omitted.) He asserts that the court had no discretion here, because he did not take the same approach but, instead, agreed to the empanelment of a sentencing jury \u201cif, in lieu of accepting imposition of a presumptive sentence \u2014 the only legally valid sentence in the absence of juried aggravating factors \u2014 the state sought reinstatement of the departure sentence * * (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Defendant is incorrect. In <em>Harding, </em>we explained that, \u201cassuming that the departure sentence constitutes an erroneous <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>term in the judgment in this case, <em>in exercising its discretion whether to correct that error, the trial court properly may take into account </em>such factors and circumstances as the fact that the relief sought by defendant\u201d was broader than the relief that would have been available on a successful direct appeal from the sentence. 222 Or App at 421 (other italics omitted; emphasis added). In other words, the consideration that defendant in this case points to \u2014 the relief sought in the motion to modify \u2014 was merely a circumstance that the trial court was entitled to consider in determining whether to exercise its discretion.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
