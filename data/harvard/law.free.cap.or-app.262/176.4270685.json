We reject defendant\u2019s arguments without discussion. However, because \u2014 as the state points out \u2014 there is an error in the judgment, we reverse and remand with instructions to correct that error.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-5\">Following a bench trial, the trial court found defendant guilty of attempted first-degree sexual abuse (as a lesser-included offense of the completed crime of first-degree sexual abuse, which was charged in Count 1), attempted first-degree unlawful sexual penetration (as a lesser-included offense of the completed crime of first-degree unlawful sexual penetration, which was charged in Count 2), and attempted first-degree sodomy (as charged in Count 3). The trial court correctly merged the guilty verdicts on Counts 1 and 2 for attempted first-degree sexual abuse and attempted first-degree unlawful sexual penetration, but the judgment of conviction erroneously reflects that the guilty verdicts were merged into a conviction for the <em>completed </em>offense of first-degree unlawful sexual penetration. We therefore remand for entry of a judgment finding defendant guilty of attempted first-degree sexual abuse (Count 1), attempted first-degree unlawful sexual penetration (Count 2), and attempted first-degree sodomy (Count 3), and merger of the guilty verdicts on Counts 1 and 2 into a single conviction of <em>attempted </em>first-degree unlawful sexual penetration.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-6\">Reversed and remanded for entry of a corrected judgment finding defendant guilty of attempted first-degree sexual abuse (Count 1), attempted first-degree unlawful sexual penetration (Count 2), and attempted first-degree sodomy (Count 3), and for merger of the guilty verdicts on Counts 1 and 2 into a single conviction of attempted first-degree unlawful sexual penetration; otherwise affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
