We agree with defendant that she was stopped in violation of Article I, section 9, of the Oregon Constitution<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> no later than when a police officer, in the absence of reasonable suspicion, ordered her to move away from the vehicle that she had been driving and that the evidence that she seeks to suppress was the unattenuated product of that illegality. Accordingly, we conclude that the trial court erred in denying defendant\u2019s motion to suppress and reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-5\">We review the trial court\u2019s denial of defendant\u2019s motion to suppress for errors of law. <em>State v. Ehly, </em>317 Or 66, 75, 854 P2d 421 (1993). In doing so, we are bound by the trial court\u2019s express and implicit factual findings if there is constitutionally sufficient evidence in the record to support them. <em>Id. </em>We state the facts in accordance with that standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-6\">On April 7, 2011, Aaron Davis, a City of Albany police officer with approximately seven and one-half years of \u201cnarcotics detective experience,\u201d was working with Hutch, his \u201cnarcotics detection trained police canine.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> During the lunch hour, Davis pulled his unmarked vehicle into a parking lot at a public park to give Hutch a \u201cbreak.\u201d Davis\u2019s view of pedestrians and vehicles entering the park from NE Waverly Drive was barred by a \u201cjersey wall\u201d until they had almost entered the parking lot, as was their view of his vehicle.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b374-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>While Hutch was taking his break, Davis noticed another vehicle parked \u201cat the edge of the park with a single male occupant.\u201d Davis ran \u201ca records check.\u201d He recognized the name of the vehicle\u2019s registered owner as that of a \u201creported * * * dealer of methamphetamine,\u201d but Davis could not determine whether the male occupant was the registered owner. At that point, Davis, who was wearing a uniform, saw a female \u2014 later identified as \u201cShawna\u201d \u2014 \u201cclear [] the edge of the jersey wall.\u201d Shawna looked in Davis\u2019s direction.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Then, \u201call at once\u201d the vehicle that had been in the park left and a second vehicle driven by defendant \u201cquickly pull[ed] up\u201d and \u201cpickfed] up\u201d Shawna and left the park traveling southbound on NE Waverly Drive. Based on what he had just observed, Davis believed that he \u201cpotentially had interrupted a drug deal.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b374-4\">Davis left the park, located the vehicle that defendant was driving, and followed it. Davis did not observe defendant commit any traffic infractions. He \u201cran\u201d the vehicle\u2019s license plate number and learned that its \u201cfemale registered owner * * * had a court ordered driver\u2019s suspension history for drugs.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b374-5\">After taking a circuitous route, defendant stopped at a house, which Davis recognized because, several years before, he had \u201cprocessed a methamphetamine lab\u201d there and, on a separate occasion, had \u201cseized * * * drug evidence\u201d from the house. Shawna got out of the vehicle and entered the house. According to Davis, based on his training and experience, it is common for a house in which methamphetamine has been manufactured to continue to be associated with \u201cdrug activity.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b374-6\">Defendant drove away. Davis followed but did not activate his lights or otherwise require defendant to stop the vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-7\">Eventually, defendant parked the vehicle at her apartment complex next to a dumpster. Davis parked his car <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>\u201cparallel\u201d to and \u201capproximately 30 feet\u201d away from defendant\u2019s vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-4\">When defendant got out of the car, Davis asked her about her route of travel and what she was up to. According to Davis, defendant explained that she had given her friend Shawna \u2014 whose last name defendant did not know \u2014 a ride after Shawna had called her from a pay phone. Davis thought that response was \u201codd\u201d because the nearest pay phone was \u201cabout a quarter mile away and in the opposite direction\u201d of where he had first seen Shawna. Davis also indicated to defendant that he \u201csuspect [ed] drug activity\u201d and asked defendant whether she used drugs and whether she owned the vehicle that she had been driving. According to Davis, defendant \u201cadmitted to the previous use of both methamphetamine and marijuana\u201d but told him that it \u201chad been months since her last use\u201d and explained that the vehicle was her mother\u2019s. By this point, another officer, Ronald Parker, had arrived.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-5\">Davis asked defendant for her identification, which she provided. He ran the identification, but there were no outstanding warrants. Davis returned the identification to defendant and continued speaking with her \u201cmindful to keep it as a casual consensual encounter.\u201d At some point, defendant told Davis that she felt harassed and asked whether she could leave. According to Davis, \u201cI told her point blank, \u2018This isn\u2019t a stop and you\u2019re free to go at any time. You\u2019ve been free to go at any time.\u2019 \u201d Defendant again indicated that she felt as though she was being harassed. Davis asked whether defendant had drugs on her person or in the car. Defendant said that she did not and that Davis could not look. Davis then requested defendant\u2019s \u201cpermission\u201d to use Hutch to \u201csniff the exterior of her car.\u201d According to Davis, defendant would not allow it and \u201cbegan making excuses about why she didn\u2019t want the canine to sniff the car and two of the excuses that she used were \u2018It\u2019s not my car\u2019 and \u2018Other people may have left things in the car,\u201d\u2019 which Davis \u201chad previously heard * * * from people who were in possession of controlled substances in particular but also other evidence of crimes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b375-6\">At that point, Davis made a \u201cmental tabulation\u201d of the following circumstances: (1) Davis had observed what he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>believed was a \u201csuspected drug deal in the park.\u201d (2) Defendant gave a ride to Shawna \u201cwhose last name [defendant] didn\u2019t know\u201d and \u201cwho supposedly called from a pay phone when none was immediately present.\u201d (3) Shawna got out of the vehicle \u201cin a high drug use area\u201d and entered \u201ca former drug house.\u201d (4) Defendant had \u201cadmitted\u201d to a \u201cprevious history of two types of illegal drug use.\u201d (5) Defendant was not the registered owner of the car she was driving. (6) The vehicle\u2019s registered owner \u201chad a documented drug history.\u201d (7) Defendant had made statements distancing herself from \u201cpotential evidence in the vehicle that could be attributed to her.\u201d And (8) defendant was in a \u201chigh drug trafficking and use area of the city.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b376-4\">Davis then asked defendant to step away from the vehicle so that he could deploy Hutch to perform \u201can exterior sniff.\u201d Defendant refused. Davis asked again, and again defendant refused.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-5\">Both Davis and Parker testified as to what occurred next. According to Davis,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b376-6\">\u201cI reached out to escort [defendant] away from the vehicle and she told me not to touch her. She kind of jerked her arm away and said[,] \u2018Don\u2019t touch me,\u2019 at which I complied, and then she went and sat on the hood of her car. I had to tell her twice rather directly to get off the car.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b376-7\">Consistently with Davis\u2019s testimony, Parker testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b376-8\">\u201cWhen [Davis] first told [defendant] he wanted to do an air sniff then [defendant] was having difficulty, I would say, understanding that <em>we needed her to step away from the vehicle while he did this. </em>That took some convincing. Once she was convinced to step away from the vehicle <em>as she was interfering with his investigation </em>then she decided to sit on the hood of the car, and that was explained to her a couple of times that <em>she needed to get off the hood of the car so we could conduct the investigation. Once threatened with arrestfj she finally stepped from the hood of the car </em>and stood in front of the car, and then that\u2019s when * * * Davis conducted a free air sniff with his canine.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b377-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>(Emphasis added.) Based on that testimony, the trial court found:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b377-4\">\u201cDefendant was then ordered, by either Davis or Parker, to move away from the car to allow the search to occur under threat of being immediately arrested. She moved away.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b377-5\">At that point, Davis deployed Hutch, who is trained to detect cocaine, methamphetamine, heroin, and marijuana. On his second pass around the vehicle, Hutch \u201calert[ed].\u201d According to Davis, he then saw \u201cHutch trace to the door seam, and that would be the front left door seam, sniff intently and then sit, which is an indication for the presence of one of those four odors.\u201d Parker testified that he \u201cimmediately placed [defendant] in handcuffs and advised her of her rights.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b377-6\">Based on Hutch\u2019s behavior and the eight circumstances described above, Davis believed that he had probable cause to search the vehicle. At this point, Davis searched the car, finding methamphetamine and drug paraphernalia in various places, and defendant made incriminating statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-7\">Defendant was charged with possession of methamphetamine and moved to suppress \u201call evidence derived from the stop of * * * defendant, including oral derivative statements, and the subsequent warrantless search and seizure of her person and the vehicle.\u201d In the trial court, defendant contended that, because she had been unlawfully stopped, all evidence obtained as a result of that stop must be suppressed. Alternatively, defendant contended that, if she had been lawfully stopped, the warrantless search of the vehicle was not supported by probable cause or an exception to the warrant requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-8\">In resolving defendant\u2019s motion, the trial court did not address defendant\u2019s primary contention that she had been unlawfully stopped and that all derivative evidence obtained as a result of that stop must be suppressed. Instead, the court denied defendant\u2019s motion, addressing only her alternative contention, reasoning that the warrant-less search of the vehicle was supported by probable cause and the automobile exception to the warrant requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>Thereafter, defendant pleaded no contest to possession of methamphetamine, reserving in writing the right to challenge the court\u2019s suppression ruling. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-4\">On appeal, defendant contends that the dispositive issues are those that the trial court did not address in resolving defendant\u2019s motion to <em>suppress </em>\u2014 viz., (1) whether defendant was stopped, (2) if defendant was stopped, whether the stop was supported by reasonable suspicion, and (3) if defendant was unlawfully stopped, whether there was a causal \u201cbut for\u201d connection between that illegality and the evidence that defendant seeks to suppress. Even though the court did not resolve those issues, we need not remand this case to the trial court to engage in the proper legal inquiry. That is so for two interrelated reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-5\">First, as noted above, 262 Or App at 357, the trial court found that \u201c[defendant was *** <em>ordered, </em>by either Davis or Parker, <em>to move away from the car </em>to allow the search to occur <em>under threat of being immediately arrested\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) The legal significance of that finding\u2014 which the state essentially acknowledged at oral argument\u2014 is that, by that point in the encounter, defendant had been stopped. <em>See State v. Ashbaugh, </em>349 Or 297, 316, 244 P3d 360 (2010) (holding that a police-citizen encounter is a constitutionally significant seizure \u201c(a) if a law enforcement officer intentionally and significantly restricts, interferes with, or otherwise deprives an individual of that individual\u2019s liberty or freedom of movement; or (b) if a reasonable person under the totality of the circumstances <em>would </em>believe that (a) above has occurred\u201d (emphasis in original)); <em>see also State v. Fair, </em>353 Or 588, 594, 302 P3d 417 (2013) (explaining that, \u201c[i]n applying that standard, we look to whether the encounter entailed a significant restraint on defendant\u2019s liberty imposed either by physical force or through some show of authority\u201d (internal quotation marks and brackets omitted)); <em>State v. Ruiz, </em>196 Or App 324, 327, 101 P3d 824 (2004), <em>rev den, </em>338 Or 363 (2005) (holding that officer stopped defendant by ordering him to take his hand out of his pocket).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b379-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>Second, the court found that the stop occurred \u201cto allow\u201d the dog sniff. That finding demonstrates that the trial court identified a \u201cbut for\u201d causal nexus between the stop and dog sniff. In other words, under the circumstances of this case, the court found that the stop was a necessary precondition to the performance of the dog sniff. Stated differently, had the officers not stopped defendant by ordering her away from the vehicle under the threat of arrest, the dog sniff and Hutch\u2019s corresponding alert \u2014 at which point the trial court concluded Davis had probable cause to search the vehicle \u2014 would not have occurred in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-4\">In light of those findings, the dispositive issue is whether the stop was supported by reasonable suspicion\u2014 that is, whether the stop was lawful. That is a legal issue that we can resolve on appeal without the benefit of the trial court\u2019s reasoning. <em>See State v. Musser, </em>253 Or App 178, 179, 289 P3d 340 (2012), <em>rev allowed, </em>353 Or 533 (2013) (\u201cWhether an officer has reasonable suspicion to stop a person is a question of law that we review for legal error.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b379-5\">In <em>State v. Martin, </em>260 Or App 461, 469-70, 317 P3d 408 (2014), we explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b379-6\">\u201cAn officer has reasonable suspicion to stop a person when the officer has an objectively reasonable belief, based on specific and articulable facts, that the person has committed or is about to commit a crime. The officer\u2019s suspicion must be particularized to the person and based on the person\u2019s conduct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b379-7\">\u201cThe fact that there might be innocent explanations for conduct does not mean that the conduct cannot, also give rise to reasonable suspicion of criminality. But, an officer may not stop a person simply because the person\u2019s conduct is consistent with criminal conduct; the nature of the conduct matters. As we explained in <em>[State </em>v.] <em>Alvarado, </em>[257 Or App 612, 629, 307 P3d 540 (2013),] where the state argued that a drug-trafficking stop was supported, in part, by evidence that \u2018(1) the car defendant was driving was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>owned by somebody else; (2) defendant was carrying a cell phone and a pager; and (3) the car contained multiple air fresheners and two bottles of cologne,\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b380-4\"><em>\u2018\u201ca </em>set of facts will not always create a reasonable suspicion just because those facts are consistent with, but do not necessarily suggest, a crime being committed. Wearing clothing while driving, to use an extreme example, is also consistent with the transportation of narcotics. Less extremely, so too (for all we know) is wearing cologne. This consistency, however, would not be enough to support reasonable suspicion.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b380-5\">* * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b380-6\">\u201cWhen evaluating the objective reasonableness of an officer\u2019s suspicion, a court considers the totality of the circumstances, viewed in light of the officer\u2019s experience. The officer\u2019s experience is relevant to what inferences the officer may draw from the circumstances. But, an officer\u2019s experience cannot form the entire basis for reasonable suspicion. Intuition or instinct, even of an experienced officer, cannot amount to reasonable suspicion of criminal activity.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b380-7\">(Some internal quotation marks and citations omitted; brackets in original.) Applying those principles to this case, we conclude that Davis did not have reasonable suspicion to stop defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-8\">As noted above, 262 Or App at 355-56, before ordering defendant to move away from the car, Davis identified eight circumstances that gave rise to his suspicion. Again, those circumstances are as follows: (1) Davis had observed what he believed was a \u201csuspected drug deal in the park\u201d; (2) defendant gave a ride to Shawna \u201cwhose last name [defendant] didn\u2019t know\u201d and \u201cwho supposedly called from a pay phone when none was immediately present\u201d; (3) Shawna got out of the vehicle \u201cin a high drug use area\u201d and entered \u201ca former drug house\u201d; (4) defendant had \u201cadmitted\u201d to a \u201cprevious history of two types of illegal drug use\u201d; (5) defendant was not the registered owner of the car she was driving; (6) the vehicle\u2019s registered owner \u201chad a documented drug history\u201d; (7) defendant had made statements distancing herself from \u201cpotential evidence in the vehicle that could be attributed to her\u201d; and (8) defendant was in a \u201chigh drug trafficking and use area of the city.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b381-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>As an initial matter, two of those circumstances\u2014 <em>viz., </em>defendant\u2019s presence in a \u201chigh drug trafficking and use area of the city\u201d and her \u201cadmissions\u201d to prior drug use months before the stop \u2014 carry minimal weight. With regard to the former, we have \u201crepeatedly said that a person\u2019s presence in a location associated with drug activity is insufficient to support an objectively reasonable belief that that person is himself or herself engaged in drug activity.\u201d <em>State v. Bertsch, </em>251 Or App 128, 134, 284 P3d 502 (2012). With regard to the latter, we have rejected the proposition that \u201ca person\u2019s recent drug use is sufficient, without more, to establish reasonable suspicion of present drug possession.\u201d <em>State v. Holcomb, </em>202 Or App 73, 77-78, 121 P3d 13, <em>adh\u2019d to as modified on recons, </em>203 Or App 35, 125 P3d 22 (2005); <em>see also State v. Ehret (A111248), </em>184 Or App 1, 9, 55 P3d 512 (2002) (\u201cThe fact that defendant had past involvement with drugs does not give rise to a reasonable suspicion that he possessed drugs at the time of the traffic stop [.]\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b381-4\">The remaining circumstances, in combination with those two, are collectively insufficient to establish reasonable suspicion in this case. Two salient observations demonstrate why that is so.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-5\">First, as we explained in <em>Martin, </em>\u201c[t]he officer\u2019s suspicion must be particularized to the person and based on <em>the person\u2019s </em>conduct.\u201d 260 Or App at 469 (emphasis added). Simply put, many of the circumstances to which Davis referred did not concern <em>defendant\u2019s conduct. </em>For example, the fact that the registered owner of the car that defendant was driving \u2014 that is, defendant\u2019s mother \u2014 \u201chad a documented drug history\u201d and the fact that Shawna got out of the car in a high crime area and entered a former drug house concern defendant\u2019s mother\u2019s and Shawna\u2019s conduct, not defendant\u2019s. Similarly, as to the suspected drug deal in the park, the genesis of Davis\u2019s suspicion was the fact that the registered owner of the vehicle that he spotted at the edge of the park was a reported drug dealer. Putting aside the fact that Davis did not know whether the male occupant of that vehicle was the registered owner, the owner\u2019s reported drug-related activities do not concern defendant\u2019s conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>Second, Davis explained that, in his experience, \u201cpeople will utilize vehicles not registered to them when they\u2019re in the course of committing crimes, which would include buying and selling drugs, so as to thwart law enforcement\u2019s attempts to identify them\u201d and defendant\u2019s statements \u201cdistancing herself from potential evidence in the vehicle that could be attributed to her\u201d were a \u201cred flag\u201d or \u201cexcuse as to why there is something there but they don\u2019t want it to be theirs.\u201d Although \u201c[t]he officer\u2019s experience is relevant to what inferences the officer may draw from the circumstances,\u201d <em>Martin, </em>260 Or App at 470, the inferences that Davis drew in this case were not reasonable. As the trial court found and the record demonstrates, during Davis\u2019s initial questioning of defendant, he learned that defendant\u2019s mother was the registered owner of the vehicle that defendant had been driving. Under that circumstance, it was not reasonable for Davis to infer that defendant was using the vehicle in the course of committing a crime so as to thwart law enforcement\u2019s efforts to identify her.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-4\">Ultimately, when considered in their totality in light of Davis\u2019s experience, the circumstances in this case establish nothing more than that defendant, who had admitted to using drugs months before the stop, was present in high drug use areas and was associating with others who had been or may have been involved in drug-related activities.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> If that were sufficient to establish reasonable suspicion, we would be effectively sanctioning nonparticularized status-based stops of individuals who have used drugs in the past. The law does not go that far.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-5\">In sum, here, defendant was stopped no later than when she was ordered to move away from the vehicle that she had been driving under the threat of immediate arrest. That stop was not supported by reasonable suspicion and was unlawful. Under the circumstances in this case, the evidence that defendant seeks to suppress was the unattenuated product of that illegality because, but for the illegal stop, the investigatory dog sniff would not have occurred, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>which, in turn, led to Hutch\u2019s alert, defendant\u2019s incriminatory statements, and the search of the vehicle.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Accordingly, the trial court erred in denying defendant\u2019s motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-4\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b373-7\"> ORS 135.335(3) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b373-8\">\u201cWith the consent of the court and the state, a defendant may enter a conditional plea of guilty or no contest reserving, in writing, the right, on appeal from the judgment, to a review of an adverse determination of any specified pretrial motion.
