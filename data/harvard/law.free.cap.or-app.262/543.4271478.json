In a single assignment of error, he argues that the trial court erred \u201cby permitting the prosecutor to ask defendant [during cross-examination] whether the police officer witnesses were lying.\u201d Defendant acknowledges that he did not object to the prosecutor\u2019s line of questioning and concedes that the argument he raises on appeal is not preserved. Nonetheless, he asks us to reverse his convictions and remand for a new trial on the ground that the trial court plainly erred by failing to exclude the testimony, despite the lack of any defense objection. We disagree with defendant\u2019s contention that the trial court had a duty, in the circumstances present here, \u201cto <em>sua sponte </em>preclude the prosecutor from asking whether prosecution witnesses were lying.\u201d Accordingly, defendant\u2019s unpreserved argument presents no basis for reversal.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-5\">In evaluating whether the trial court plainly erred by not interrupting the prosecutor\u2019s cross-examination of defendant, we must consider the entire context in which the challenged questions were asked. Accordingly, we describe the trial proceedings in some detail.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-6\">In his opening statement, the prosecutor outlined the evidence that the state planned to use to establish that defendant had driven while intoxicated, including evidence that defendant had been driving westbound in the eastbound lane of State Street in Salem shortly after 2:00 in the morning, that defendant exhibited various signs of intoxication, that defendant made inculpatory statements during the stop and subsequent arrest, and that defendant refused to take a breath test. Defense counsel\u2019s opening statement asked the jury to pay close attention to the evidence and informed the jury that defendant planned to testify and would tell the jurors \u201cwhat his recollection of things was as opposed to the police officer\u2019s recitation of the \u2014 in their testimony.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b564-7\">The trial testimony largely reflected what the lawyers had anticipated in their opening statements. Sergeant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>Burnham testified that, at 2:00 a.m. on January 1, he was on patrol when he saw a car traveling westbound on State Street in the eastbound lanes, at a point where the lanes are separated by <em>\u201ca </em>physical divider\u201d and a sign \u201ctell[s] cars to go to the right of that divider.\u201d Burnham stopped defendant for driving the wrong way and asked defendant for his license, registration, and proof of insurance. Burnham also asked defendant if he had consumed any alcohol. Burnham testified that defendant handed over his license and then asked what else Burnham needed; as defendant spoke, Burnham smelled alcohol on his breath. Burnham also testified that defendant was having difficulty responding to more than one question at a time, his movements were very slow, and Burnham suspected that he was under the influence of alcohol.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-4\">Because Burnham was the shift supervisor and tried \u201cnot to be tied into an investigation,\u201d he called other sheriffs deputies to the scene. Deputy Clarke responded and approached defendant, who still was seated in his car. Clarke testified that defendant\u2019s eyes were bloodshot and watery, that his speech was slurred to the point of incoherence, and that he acknowledged having drunk alcohol that evening. Clarke asked defendant if he would perform field sobriety tests; at that point, according to Clarke, defendant \u201casked if [Clarke] could just follow him home,\u201d saying that if Clarke \u201cfollowed him home he would be fine, because then he would be home.\u201d Clarke asked again if defendant would perform field sobriety tests, and he agreed, although he asserted that he \u201chad balance issues\u201d and \u201cwasn\u2019t able to keep his balance even when he is sober.\u201d Clarke testified that, in response, he told defendant that he would \u201cjust do the one test, which is the eye test,\u201d and defendant \u201cwas okay with that.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b565-5\">Clarke testified that defendant had such difficulty balancing once he got out of his car that Clarke feared defendant would fall and \u201casked him to just lean up against the car so he wouldn\u2019t fall over.\u201d Even leaning against the car, defendant had \u201can upper body sway.\u201d Clarke administered the horizontal gaze nystagmus test to defendant and testified that he observed four out of six clues of intoxication.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>Finally, Clarke testified, he asked defendant \u201cwhere he would rate himself on [an intoxication] scale from one to ten,\u201d where a rating of \u201cone\u201d would be \u201cstone sober, nothing to drink, and ten being [the] most drop down drunk he had ever been.\u201d Defendant\u2019s \u201cfirst response was, well, I am not crawling down the road.\u201d Clarke repeated the question and, he testified, defendant responded, \u201cI am busted.\u201d According to Clarke, defendant then \u201cstarted blaming the bar that he was at, and the bartender, thinking that they should get in trouble for allowing him to drive home the way he was.\u201d Defendant then was arrested for driving under the influence, at which point he \u201cbecame very irate, began yelling, screaming, threatening, and that continued\u201d while Clarke and another deputy walked defendant over to a patrol car. Clarke testified that defendant\u2019s yelling continued during the drive to the jail, where defendant gave a \u201ccolorful answer\u201d when Clarke asked him if he would take a breath test; Clarke interpreted that response as a refusal.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-4\">After Burnham and Clarke testified, defendant took the stand and testified about the night in question. Defendant stated that he had driven to the airport at about midnight to watch fireworks and sat there for a couple of hours. Defendant left the airport at about <em>2:00 </em>a.m., then went to a bar where, he testified, he drank only half of one beer. Defendant testified that he then left the bar because it was getting late. He acknowledged that he drove the wrong way on State Street, but explained that he had been confused, thinking that the concrete street divider was not a lane divider (which should be on his left), but the sidewalk (which should be on his right). Defendant testified that he immediately realized that he was driving the wrong way and \u2014 \u201cjust when [he] was getting ready to pull in\u201d to a parking lot \u2014 he saw flashing lights, so pulled in and sat \u201cwaiting for the officer to arrive.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b566-5\">Defendant testified that the officer who approached him asked if he knew why he had been pulled over, and that is when defendant said, \u201cI am busted,\u201d referring to having driven the wrong way, not to being intoxicated. Defense counsel then asked if defendant had heard the officers\u2019 testimony earlier in the day (regarding their encounter <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>with defendant), and defendant responded that he had. Defendant denied that he had had any trouble retrieving his documents; he testified that he \u201cpulled everything out real quick\u201d and \u201chad everything [the officer] needed right there.\u201d Defense counsel then asked, \u201c[W]hen the officer also said that you were talking about the bartender, do you recall that?\u201d Defendant responded that he had \u201conly seen her [the bartender] for half a second\u201d because she gave him \u201cone beer and that was it.\u201d Defense counsel continued to ask defendant questions that were phrased in terms of how the law enforcement officers had testified earlier in the trial:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b567-4\">\u201cQ. And now let\u2019s talk about \u2014 -you heard the testimony from Deputy Clarke here today, correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b567-5\">\u201cA. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b567-6\">\u201cQ. And he described you and your behavior. <em>Do you agree that that was what your behavior </em>was?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b567-7\">\u201cA. No, I do not.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b567-8\">* * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b567-9\">\u201cQ. You heard the testimony from Deputy Ryan today about taking you to the jail. Do you recall that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b567-10\">\u201cA. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b567-11\">\u201cQ. <em>And at any time did you tell him the colorful language that was </em>described?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b567-12\">\u201cA. No, I did not.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b567-13\">(Emphasis added.) Defendant also denied having had any alcohol to drink that night other than \u201chalf a beer\u201d and denied having been impaired by alcohol.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-14\">Only after defense counsel elicited the testimony described above did the prosecutor ask the cross-examination questions to which defendant belatedly objects. The pertinent part of the cross-examination started with this exchange between the prosecutor and defendant:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b567-15\">\u201cQ. Okay. And you told the officer you had \u2014 I will get what you said to him. I don\u2019t want to misquote. Some drinks and then a soda. And then another time you said you had a few drinks, and then you said you were drinking beer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b568-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>\u201cA. <em>That is not a true statement. I did not tell him that.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b568-4\">\u201cQ. <em>The officer is making that up?</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b568-5\"><em>\u201cA. </em>He must be, or he misunderstood, because I said I had half a beer. * * *\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b568-6\">(Emphasis added.) After some further questioning on other topics, the prosecutor asked defendant about his testimony that he had immediately told the first officer who came up to his car that he \u201cwas busted\u201d (purportedly in reference to having driven down State Street the wrong way, as compared to later telling another officer that he \u201cwas busted\u201d in reference to having driven while intoxicated), and the prosecutor noted that the first officer had not testified that defendant made any such statement at that point in time:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b568-7\">\u201cQ. Okay. And then you heard Sergeant Burnham come in here and testify. He was the first deputy. He never mentioned you telling him that you were busted.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b568-8\">\u201cA. Was he the one that first came to the window?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b568-9\">\u201cQ. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b568-10\">\u201cA. Oh, well.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b568-11\">\u201cQ. <em>So he is lying, too?</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b568-12\">\u201cA. Maybe he don\u2019t remember. I remember him saying a lot of things he didn\u2019t remember.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b568-13\">\u201cQ. Okay. And your testimony is that you never said anything about, well, I am not crawling on the ground?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b568-14\">\u201cA. I never said anything like that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b568-15\">\u201cQ. <em>Deputy Clarkee was lying?</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b568-16\"><em>\u201cA. </em>Or he made it up, surely. I suppose.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b568-17\">\u201cQ. All right. <em>And then also that Sergeant Burnham lied about the paperwork, </em>that you just grabbed it real quick from your wallet and from where it is in your car?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b568-18\">\u201cA. He didn\u2019t say I grabbed it real quick. He said he was\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b568-19\">\u201cQ. No, you said that. You said you just grabbed it right quick and handed it to him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b568-20\">\u201cA. I got my insurance papers first, pulled my wallet out, and handed it to him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b569-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>\u201cQ. Okay. <em>So he was lying about that as well?</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b569-3\"><em>\u201cA. </em>I am going to say definitely.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b569-4\">(Emphasis added.) The prosecutor asked additional questions apparently aimed at highlighting the differences between defendant\u2019s testimony and that given by the officers, but most of those later questions did not as explicitly ask defendant to opine on whether the officers had lied. The prosecutor wrapped up cross-examination of defendant, however, by asking whether defendant\u2019s testimony was \u201cthat these officers are lying\u201d and defendant answered affirmatively. Defendant did not object to any of those questions.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-5\">On redirect examination, defense counsel asked defendant about his testimony that the officers had lied, apparently attempting to get defendant to agree that, instead, the officers may have been \u201cjust mistaken.\u201d Defendant did not entirely agree, however, and stated that, in his opinion, \u201csome of the things they said were a lie.\u201d Defendant was the last witness. After hearing closing arguments and jury instructions, the jurors deliberated and returned a unanimous verdict of guilty on the DUII charge. The trial court then found defendant guilty of refusing the breath test.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-6\">On appeal, defendant argues that the prosecutor\u2019s cross-examination of defendant \u201celicited improper vouching testimony,\u201d as it invited defendant to offer an opinion on the testifying officers\u2019 truthfulness. Defendant relies on <em>State v. Isom, </em>306 Or 587, 761 P2d 524 (1988), in which the Supreme Court emphasized that no witness may be asked to give an opinion on whether another witness is telling the truth. <em>Id. </em>at 591-92. In <em>Isom, </em>the court explained that the prohibition applies to circumstances in which a prosecutor cross-examines a defendant in a criminal case by asking whether a law enforcement officer \u201cwould *** be lying\u201d if he described facts differently than the defendant had. <em>Id. </em>at 590-91.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-7\">Defendant acknowledges that he did not object to the prosecutor\u2019s questions on the ground that they improperly sought to elicit his opinion on the officers\u2019 truthfulness. However, based on his contention that the prosecutor\u2019s questioning was improper under <em>Isom, </em>defendant argues that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>trial court plainly erred by not intervening, <em>sua </em>sponte, to prevent the prosecutor from \u201crepeatedly ask[ing] defendant whether the officers were lying.\u201d Defendant asks us to exercise our discretion to correct that error, pointing to other cases in which, he asserts, we have \u201creversed *** based on trial courts\u2019 unpreserved errors in allowing comments on witnesses\u2019 credibility.\u201d Defendant relies particularly on <em>B. A. v. Webb, </em>253 Or App 1, 10-17, 289 P3d 300 (2012), <em>rev den, </em>353 Or 428 (2013), a tort case in which we held that the trial court plainly erred by not excluding testimony from a mental-health counselor and a psychosexual evaluator that the plaintiff was a victim of childhood sexual abuse and that her reports of that abuse were credible.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-4\">In response, the state acknowledges that \u201cone witness may not comment on the credibility of another witness.\u201d Nonetheless, the state argues that we should not reverse defendant\u2019s conviction for two reasons. First, the state contends, defendant invited any error by \u201cvolunteer[ing] his belief that police officers were not truthful in their testimony prior to the prosecutor asking him about the officers\u2019 credibility\u201d and then revisiting the issue on redirect examination. Second, the state argues that we should \u201cdecline to address defendant\u2019s claim because the error was harmless.\u201d In that regard, the state asserts that the alleged harm in this case \u2014 that <em>\u201cdefendant\u2019s </em>comments about the credibility of the state\u2019s witnesses could have caused the jury to view his own testimony as less credible\u201d \u2014 is different from the harm associated with a more \u201ctypical\u201d vouching case, in which the risk is \u201cthat the jury might believe the credibility assessment of the expert or police officer [who testifies regarding the credibility of another witness] and not exercise independent judgment.\u201d (Emphasis in original.)</p>\n<p id=\"b570-5\">We agree with the state that the challenged testimony in this case differs materially from the kind of testimony that, we have held, a trial court is obligated to exclude <em>sua sponte. </em>In our view, however, that difference does not matter only to a harmless-error analysis. Rather, it also informs our analysis of whether the trial court committed plain error in the first place.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>We may review an unpreserved claim of error if that error is \u201cplain,\u201d that is, if (1) the error is one of law, (2) the error is \u201cobvious, not reasonably in dispute,\u201d and (3) the error \u201cappears on the face of the record,\u201d so that we need not \u201cgo outside the record to identify the error or choose between competing inferences, and the facts constituting the error are irrefutable.\u201d <em>State v. Reyes-Camarena, </em>330 Or 431, 435, 7 P3d 522 (2000) (internal quotation marks omitted). In determining whether those criteria are met, it is critical to identify the exact nature of the error that the trial court purportedly committed. When, as here, the claimed \u201cplain error\u201d is associated with a trial court not having <em>sua sponte </em>interrupted a line of questioning (or not having excluded the resulting evidence <em>sua sponte), </em>the existence of any error does not depend solely on whether \u2014 as an abstract matter\u2014 the lawyer\u2019s questions or the elicited answers would have been inadmissible if they had been objected to. Rather, any \u201cplain error\u201d must relate to the trial court having not taken affirmative steps to intervene in the parties\u2019 litigation. We recently addressed that point in a case in which the appellant argued that the trial court should have <em>sua sponte </em>excluded a nurse practitioner\u2019s testimony that a complainant\u2019s statements were \u201chighly concerning for sexual abuse\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b571-6\">\u201cOn appeal, defendant vaguely asserts that the \u2018admission of the diagnosis\u2019 was error and that \u2018the trial court should have excluded [the testimony].\u2019 In this case, however, the trial court did nothing to admit the challenged portion of [the nurse practitioner\u2019s] testimony; because no objection was made, the trial court did not make a ruling on the admissibility of that testimony. If there was error, then, it was necessarily based on the trial court\u2019s <em>inaction </em>\u2014 i.e., the trial court\u2019s failure to strike the testimony <em>sua sponte </em>when [the nurse practitioner] offered it on cross-examination.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b571-7\"><em>State v. Ramirez-Estrada, </em>260 Or App 312, 316, 317 P3d 322 (2013), <em>rev den, </em>355 Or 317 (2014).</p>\n<p id=\"b571-8\">Thus, the question before us in this case is not whether the prosecutor\u2019s cross-examination of defendant was objectionable. Rather, the pertinent question is whether the trial court plainly erred by not interrupting the prosecutor\u2019s cross-examination of defendant <em>sua sponte.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b572-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>In answering that question, we first ask whether the claimed error is one of law that is \u201cobvious, not reasonably in dispute.\u201d <em>Reyes-Camarena, </em>330 Or at 435. We start from a straightforward proposition on which the parties agree. In ordinary circumstances, one witness may not be asked to give an opinion on whether another witness is lying. Moreover, under <em>Isom, </em>that principle applies not only to the kinds of law-enforcement, medical, and other expert witnesses whose testimony regarding credibility often is at issue in \u201cvouching\u201d cases, but also to testimony given by the defendant in a criminal case, who should not be asked whether other witnesses have been truthful. 306 Or at 590-91. Thus \u2014 at least in most circumstances \u2014 it is beyond dispute that such questioning is objectionable, and that any responsive testimony commenting on the credibility of another witness would be inadmissible if it were objected to. That does not necessarily mean, however, that it is beyond dispute that a trial court must always intervene <em>sua sponte </em>to prevent that kind of evidence from reaching the jury. To the contrary, the cases in which we have held that trial courts are obligated to exclude evidence in the absence of an objection\u2014 and plainly err if they do not \u2014 all share an important characteristic that is not present here.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-4\">Each of the cases in which we have held that a trial court should have excluded evidence <em>sua sponte </em>(perhaps necessarily suggesting that the court also has a <em>sua sponte </em>obligation to interrupt a lawyer\u2019s questions that seek to elicit such testimony) has involved true \u201cvouching\u201d evidence, that is, one witness\u2019s testimony that he or she believes that another witness is or is not credible, which a party offers to bolster or undermine the veracity of that other witness. <em>See, e.g., State v. Higgins, </em>258 Or App 177, 308 P3d 352 (2013), <em>rev den, </em>354 Or 700 (2014) (plain error for trial court not to exclude mother\u2019s testimony that she \u201cknew for sure\u201d that her daughter was not lying when the daughter said that the defendant had raped her); <em>B. A., </em>253 Or App at 10-17 (plain error for trial court not to exclude testimony from mental-health professionals that the plaintiffs reports of abuse were credible); <em>State v. Lowell, </em>249 Or App 364, 366-67, 277 P3d 588, <em>rev den, </em>352 Or 378 (2012) (trial court plainly erred by allowing a detective to comment directly on the defendant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>credibility by stating that he did not think the defendant \u201cwas being very honest and upfront\u201d and that, based on his classroom training and experience, he understood the defendant\u2019s statements to be of a type that indicates \u201cthat somebody is not being truthful\u201d). That kind of testimony impermissibly \u201cinvade [s] the jury\u2019s role as the sole judge of the credibility of another witness.\u201d <em>State v. Charboneau, </em>323 Or 38, 47, 913 P2d 308 (1996). Often, it creates a \u201crisk that the jury will not make its own credibility determination, which it is fully capable of doing, but will instead defer\u201d to an expert\u2019s opinion on that point. <em>State v. Southard, </em>347 Or 127, 141, 218 P3d 104 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b573-4\">This case does not present the same kind of \u201cvouching\u201d concerns as the cases cited above, which all involved a risk that jurors would rely on witnesses\u2019 opinions about the credibility of an alleged victim to avoid their independent obligation to determine whether the complainant\u2019s allegations were truthful. Here, in asking defendant whether the officers had lied, the prosecutor was not similarly inviting the jurors to abdicate their responsibility to determine the officers\u2019 credibility and, instead, rely on defendant\u2019s opinion about their veracity. Put differently, the credibility <em>of the officers </em>was not the point of the prosecutor\u2019s cross-examination of defendant. Rather, the prosecutor sought to undermine the credibility <em>of defendant </em>by contrasting his version of the pertinent events with the officers\u2019 testimony on the same topics, and by getting defendant to acknowledge that, if his own testimony was true, the officers must be lying. We are not aware of any case holding that a trial court is obligated to intervene <em>sua sponte </em>in that kind of situation, where the point of the questions is not to elicit \u201cvouching\u201d testimony to bolster or undermine a different witness\u2019s testimony, but instead is directed at undermining the credibility of the witness who is presently on the stand. <em>Cf. State v. Sanchez-Jacobo, </em>250 Or App 621, 631, 282 P3d 880 (2012), <em>rev den, </em>353 Or 280 (2013) (\u201c[A] witness does not impermissibly Vouch for\u2019 or \u2018bolster\u2019 his or her <em>own </em>testimony by proclaiming truthfulness.\u201d (Emphasis in original.)). Because there are no cases on point, and because it is not \u201cobvious\u201d that the concerns that form the basis for a trial court\u2019s duty to <em>sua sponte </em>exclude true vouching evidence extend to the kind of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>questioning at issue here, we cannot say that the trial court plainly erred by not interrupting the prosecutor\u2019s cross-examination of defendant in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
