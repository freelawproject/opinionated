They each assign error to the juvenile court\u2019s ruling that parents could not present expert testimony and other evidence at the permanency hearing identifying the cause of the \u201cunexplained physical injury\u201d that resulted in the juvenile court\u2019s initial assumption of jurisdiction over parents\u2019 then-infant daughter, C.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The juvenile court excluded the evidence on the ground that it was not relevant to the issues at the permanency hearing but, instead, represented an attempt by parents to relitigate the original jurisdictional findings. We review the juvenile court\u2019s relevancy determination for legal error, <em>State v. Carreiro, </em>185 Or App 19, 22, 57 P3d 910 (2002), and reverse.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b155-5\">This case arose when, at a routine pediatric exam, the pediatrician observed a small bruise on the cheek of then-two-month-old C. Concerned about the potential for abuse, the pediatrician ordered a skeletal survey of C. The x-rays were \u201cconcerning for a probable healing metaphyseal corner fracture in [C\u2019s] distal right tibial metaphysis,\u201d that is, a possible fracture of C\u2019s tibia.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Doctors opined that the fracture was indicative of nonaccidental trauma.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-6\">Concerned that C had been abused, the Department of Human Services (DHS) removed C from parents\u2019 care and placed her with a foster family. A few months later, parents admitted to facts giving rise to the juvenile court\u2019s jurisdiction. Specifically, each parent admitted that his or her \u201clack of parenting skills\u201d impaired his or her \u201cability to provide minimally adequate care\u201d for C. Each parent also admitted that C \u201csustained an unexplained physical injury to include [] distal tibial metaphyseal fracture in the child\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>tibia while in the care of *** mother and father.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Based on those admissions, the juvenile court assumed jurisdiction over C in August 2012.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-4\">In the ensuing months, DHS provided an array of services and classes to parents, in which parents participated fully. Parents also participated in regular, twice-weekly supervised visits with C. However, DHS determined that parents were not making sufficient progress toward reunification with C, and requested that the juvenile court change the permanency plan for C from reunification to adoption.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-5\">In discovery for the permanency hearing, DHS provided C\u2019s x-rays to parents for the first time. According to father\u2019s lawyer, the x-rays had not been provided to father\u2019s lawyer in earlier discovery, even though she had \u201cmade a request for all discovery at the beginning of this case.\u201d Father\u2019s lawyer, \u201cnot being medically trained, was not aware that all medical information had not been provided.\u201d Upon receiving the x-rays, father promptly had the images examined by a medical expert, Gabaeff. Gabaeff, based on his review of the x-rays and other medical information about C, opined that the injury to C\u2019s tibia resulted from infantile rickets, and not from \u201cabusive fractures.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b156-6\">Before the hearing, DHS moved <em>in limine </em>to exclude Gabaeffs testimony and any reports. In DHS\u2019s view, in attempting to introduce Gabaeffs opinion about the cause of C\u2019s fracture, \u201cparents [were] attempting to relitigate the jurisdictional basis at the permanency hearing\u201d and were attempting to introduce evidence that was not relevant to the two issues at the permanency hearing: whether DHS had made reasonable efforts to reunify the family, and whether parents had made sufficient progress toward making it possible for C to return safely home. ORS 419B.476(2)(a). The juvenile court granted the motion to exclude the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-7\">At the hearing, DHS\u2019s primary theory as to why parents had not made sufficient progress to permit C to return <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>safely home was that parents had not provided an explanation for C\u2019s fracture. DHS argued that it is \u201calmost impossible to gauge sufficiency of progress when there is no way to know what happened and to then be able to have a meaningful conversation about how to prevent that from happening again in the future.\u201d Consistent with that theory, DHS\u2019s caseworker testified that she had not been able to facilitate parents\u2019 progress toward reunification because \u201cwe really have no idea how this occurred with [C]The caseworker explained that, in addition to participating in services, \u201cprogress also is how people are able to voice their responsibility in what has occurred. They are able to make a plan about how that won\u2019t happen again.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b157-4\">Following the hearing, the juvenile court found both that DHS had made reasonable efforts toward reunifying the family, and that parents were not making sufficient progress toward meeting the expectations set forth in the case plan for C. Based on those findings, the court ordered that the case plan be changed from reunification to adoption, and entered a permanency judgment reflecting that decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-5\">Both parents timely appealed. On appeal, they assert that the juvenile court erred when it excluded Gabaeffs testimony and report opining that C\u2019s tibia injury resulted from rickets. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-6\">Contrary to the juvenile court\u2019s conclusion, the evidence was admissible at the permanency hearing because it was relevant to the assessment of whether parents had made sufficient progress toward ameliorating the conditions that led to the tibia injury, making it possible for C to return safely home. As DHS\u2019s own witness testified \u2014 and as DHS itself argued \u2014 the assessment of a parent\u2019s progress toward addressing an unexplained injury ordinarily requires a determination of the cause of the injury. That is so because it is a determination of the cause of the injury that enables DHS and the parent to identify what actions are needed to ameliorate the conditions that led to the child\u2019s unexplained injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-7\">Here, were a factfinder to credit Gabaeffs testimony that C\u2019s tibia injury resulted from rickets rather than abuse, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>that finding would result in an entirely different assessment of parents\u2019 progress towards C\u2019s safe return home than would a finding that the injury resulted from abuse rather than rickets.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> If C\u2019s injury resulted from rickets, then the focus on parents\u2019 progress would be on what, if anything, parents should have done differently in order to recognize that their child had rickets, and what steps parents should take to avoid a similar situation in the future. If, on the other hand, C\u2019s injury resulted from abuse, the focus on parents\u2019 progress would be on what steps parents should take in order to avoid further abusive conduct.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b158-4\">Moreover, contrary to DHS\u2019s argument, parents\u2019 attempt to introduce Gabaeffs testimony and report was not an attempt to relitigate parents\u2019 jurisdictional admissions regarding the injury to C\u2019s tibia. That is, parents did not seek to introduce the evidence to demonstrate that C was not injured, that the injury was not \u201cunexplained\u201d at the time the juvenile court assumed jurisdiction over C, or that the unexplained injury was not of the sort that permitted the juvenile court to assume jurisdiction over C. In addition, parents did not admit or stipulate to any facts regarding the cause of the injury to C, and the juvenile court did not find <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>any such facts in connection with its jurisdictional determination. Because there was never any admission, stipulation, or finding as to the cause of the injury, parents\u2019 attempt to introduce evidence that the injury resulted from rickets does not represent a collateral attack on any prior admission, stipulation, or finding as to the cause of the injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-4\">In summary, the cause of C\u2019s tibia injury informs the determination of whether parents have made sufficient progress to permit C to return safely home. The testimony of Gabaeff was probative as to the cause, and parents were entitled to present it to the juvenile court at the permanency hearing, in light of the fact that there was no prior admission, stipulation, or finding as to the cause of C\u2019s injury. Accordingly, we reverse and remand for the juvenile court to conduct a new permanency hearing at which parents are permitted to introduce evidence regarding the cause of C\u2019s unexplained tibia injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-5\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b155-7\"> Parents raise other assignments of error as well. We reject them all without discussion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b155-8\"> We decline parents\u2019 request to decide this case ourselves on <em>de novo </em>review. The trial court is in the best position to resolve the factual issues presented by this case after hearing the live testimony of pertinent witnesses.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b155-9\"> The \u201ctibia\u201d is commonly known as the shinbone. <em>Stedman\u2019s Medical Dictionary </em>1835 (27th ed 2000).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b156-8\"> Because father\u2019s paternity had not been established at the time of the initial jurisdictional hearing, father also admitted that he was C\u2019s \u201cbiological father and [was] in the process of establishing\u201d legal paternity.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b158-5\"> The testimony of the psychologist who evaluated father supports this point. The psychologist testified that he assessed father\u2019s progress based on the assumption that C\u2019s tibia injury resulted from abuse, in the light of father\u2019s failure to explain the injury. He further testified that his assessment would be different if the injury did not result from abuse.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b158-6\"> Our decision in <em>Dept. of Human Services v. T. R., </em>251 Or App 6, 282 P3d 969, <em>rev den, </em>352 Or 564 (20\u00cd2), illustrates how a determination of the cause of an unexplained injury bears on the determination of a parent\u2019s progress to make it possible for a child to return safely home. There, the parents stipulated to jurisdiction based on their child\u2019s unexplained bone fractures. <em>T. R., </em>251 Or App at 8. At a permanency hearing, the juvenile court found as fact that the injuries to the child either had resulted from the parents themselves or that, at a minimum, the parents knew or should have known of the injuries. <em>Id. </em>at 11-12. The juvenile court also found that \u201cthe parents\u2019 denial of awareness of the child\u2019s injuries and distress was not credible.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 11. In light of those unchallenged factual findings about the nature and cause of the child\u2019s injury, and the parents\u2019 knowledge of it, we reasoned that the juvenile court correctly concluded that the parents had not made sufficient progress to permit the child to return safely home where the parents continued to deny knowledge of the child\u2019s injuries. <em>Id. </em>at 15. In other words, it was precisely because the cause of the injury to the child was one that the parents knew or should have known about, and because the parents lacked credibility regarding their awareness of the injury, that the parents\u2019 ongoing denials of any knowledge of the injury demonstrated that they had not made progress in grappling with the conditions that led to the child being injured.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
