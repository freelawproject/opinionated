FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b478-6\">This court reviews a trial court\u2019s denial of a motion to suppress for legal error. <em>State v. Mitchele, </em>240 Or App 86, 88, 251 P3d 760 (2010). We are bound by the trial court\u2019s findings of fact if there is sufficient evidence in the record <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>to support them. <em>State v. Ehly, </em>317 Or 66, 75, 854 P2d 421 (1993). The following facts are taken from or are consistent with the trial court\u2019s findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-4\">After 13-year-old W reported that defendant, then age 18, had engaged in sexual contact with W in defendant\u2019s bedroom, Tigard Police detectives Hockin and Lee interviewed defendant on the porch of defendant\u2019s house. Almost immediately after arriving at defendant\u2019s house, Hockin read defendant <em>Miranda </em>warnings, and defendant acknowledged that he understood his rights. Defendant denied that he had engaged in sexual contact with W and denied that W had ever been at defendant\u2019s house. Hockin told defendant that the detectives had seen approximately 155 text messages between defendant and W and that some of those messages corroborated W\u2019s allegation. The following exchange then took place:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-5\">\u201cDETECTIVE LEE: I think what Detective Hockin is trying to say is that, you know, we want to give you this opportunity. The reality is \u2014 I understand. You get a free pass because here it is. We understand that when we come to your door, everybody has a self-preservation instinct. You know what I mean? Everybody initially lies to the police. You have an instinct to preserve yourself, but the reality is\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-6\">\u201cTHE DEFENDANT: Well, you see, I\u2019ve done this before, okay, a long time ago, okay? And I obviously know how this works. I mean I \u2014 I\u2019m telling the truth right now. He never came over to my house, okay? And if \u2014 nothing ever happened.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b479-8\">The detectives stated that they could track W\u2019s cell phone and collect DNA evidence to prove that W had been in defendant\u2019s bedroom. Defendant then stated, \u201cI would like to have an attorney or something here present.\u201d Hockin told defendant that the conversation would end if defendant wanted an attorney. After some discussion about whether defendant wanted to call an attorney, Hockin added that the detectives knew \u201c89 percent of what there [was] to know about the case\u201d and that they did not \u201ceven really need\u201d defendant\u2019s statement, but \u201cin fairness\u201d to defendant, defendant had \u201cthe right to tell [the detectives his] side.\u201d Hockin further added that defendant could \u201cstick with\u201d his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>earlier statements regarding W and that they would give defendant <em>\u201ca </em>few more seconds to digest that[.]\u201d Defendant asked if his probation officer knew what was happening, and Hockin told defendant that the probation officer knew about the allegation and had read the initial report. Hockin offered defendant a \u201c[l]ast chance\u201d to add anything, defendant declined, and the detectives concluded the interview at 6:50 p.m. Defendant was arrested on a parole violation, and at approximately 7:00 p.m., was transported to the Washington County Jail. The drive lasted 30 to 40 minutes. During transport, the detectives did not ask defendant any questions.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-4\">When Hockin, Lee, and defendant arrived at the jail, they pulled into the sally port. The detectives went behind the car, where they stood with the trunk open, engaging in \u201csmall talk\u201d and \u201crummaging through the trunk\u201d while defendant remained in the back seat of the car with the windows rolled up. Hockin expressed surprise to Lee that defendant did not \u201cadmit to something [that they] could obviously prove, the fact that [W] was over at [defendant\u2019s] house.\u201d As the detectives escorted defendant from the car to the door of the intake room, defendant, who had overheard the detectives\u2019 conversation, asked, \u201cCan we talk?\u201d Hockin responded that they could talk again after defendant was booked and after they had \u201canother conversation about <em>Miranda </em>* * * \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b480-5\">After defendant was booked, Hockin, Lee, and defendant met inside the jail in a room that was adjacent to the intake room. It was 8:00 p.m. Hockin read defendant <em>Miranda </em>warnings a second time, and defendant again acknowledged that he understood them. The detectives then began a second interview. Hockin first described the events that had earlier taken place \u2014 that the detectives had interviewed defendant on the porch of defendant\u2019s house, that defendant had mentioned an attorney, and that the detectives had \u201cpretty much shut down the interview\u201d and transported defendant to jail, where defendant asked the detectives if they could talk again. The following exchange then took place:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-6\">\u201cDETECTIVE HOCKIN: You still have a right to an attorney. Just because you\u2019re \u2014 you mentioned one earlier, we terminated the interview, and now you\u2019re saying you <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>want to talk. You can talk, but you can also talk with an attorney.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-4\">\u201cTHE DEFENDANT: I don\u2019t see (inaudible) be any better, to telling tell the truth right away, so\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-5\">\u201cDETECTIVE HOCKIN: Okay. It\u2019s completely up to you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-6\">\u201cTHE DEFENDANT: Yeah.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-7\">\u201cDETECTIVE HOCKIN: All right. Well, you understand the importance of us having to go through all this because it\u2019s different again. That was just a conversation with you on your porch earlier, and now this is \u2014 you\u2019re in jail and you previously had talked about an attorney. Do you understand why we\u2019re going through all this?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-8\">\u201cTHE DEFENDANT: Yeah.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b481-9\">Defendant then gave a \u201cdramatically revised\u201d account of events, admitting that W had been at defendant\u2019s house and that defendant had had sexual contact with W. At the close of the second interview, the detectives posed the following questions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-10\">\u201cDETECTIVE HOCKIN: *** [D]o you feel comfortable that we gave you a fair opportunity to talk to us about your side of the story?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-11\">\u201cTHE DEFENDANT: Yeah.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-12\">\u201cDETECTIVE HOCKIN: Okay. Do you feel like we in any way coerced you or threatened you or made you say something you didn\u2019t want to say?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-13\">\u201cTHE DEFENDANT: No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-14\">\u201cDETECTIVE LEE: Did we make you any promises that, you know, you admit to this and we\u2019ll give you some special deal?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-15\">\u201cTHE DEFENDANT: Huh-uh (negative response). No.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b481-16\">II. PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b481-17\">Before trial, defendant moved to suppress \u201cany and all\u201d of his statements, that is, those that he made to the detectives on the porch of defendant\u2019s house and at the jail, arguing that they were obtained in violation of his constitutional right to remain silent and right to counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>During a hearing on defendant\u2019s motion to suppress, defendant argued that he invoked those constitutional rights on the porch of his house when he stated, \u201cI would like to have an attorney or something here present\u201d and that the detectives violated those rights when they failed to cease questioning him on the porch of defendant\u2019s house and talked about the case behind the car at the jail. Defendant also argued that he made statements at the jail only in response to an implied promise of leniency and that those statements were therefore involuntary. Hockin testified that neither he nor Lee made defendant any promises, that they had engaged in \u201csmall talk\u201d behind the car at the jail, and that he had merely expressed surprise that defendant had not admitted that W had been at defendant\u2019s house. Hockin further testified that he did not think that defendant could hear the conversation and that he did not intend for defendant to hear the conversation. Defendant testified that, when the detectives were talking about the case behind the car at the jail, they said that \u201cit would have been so much easier\u201d for him if he had \u201cjust confessed back at the house [.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b482-4\">During cross-examination, defendant testified that he initiated further contact with the detectives, but only because he believed that the detectives would release him or give him a lenient sentence if he told them what they wanted to hear:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b482-5\">\u201c[DEFENDANT:] I did ask Detective Hockin to continue the conversation, but the reason I asked him was because I heard them talking behind the car. And I also remembered [Detective] Lee, I think it was, saying, Oh, this is \u2014 you only get one free chance to say your thing, say your, say your story or whatever. So, yeah, I heard them talking behind the car. I was like, maybe this\u2019ll get me released or get some lenient sentence or something like that, you know.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b482-6\">\u201c[PROSECUTOR:] So it was at that point that you decided you wanted to talk to the police officers again and tell them the truth?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b482-7\">\u201c[DEFENDANT:] Just to tell them what they wanted to hear, yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b482-8\">\u201c[PROSECUTOR:] So it wasn\u2019t the truth?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b483-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>\u201c[DEFENDANT:] Hmm-mm (negative response).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b483-4\">\u201c[PROSECUTOR:] It was a lie?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b483-5\">\u201c[DEFENDANT:] Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b483-6\">\u201c[PROSECTOR:] How did you expect a lie to get you out of custody?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b483-7\">\u201c [DEFENDANT:] \u2018Cause it\u2019s what they wanted to hear.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b483-8\">The trial court denied defendant\u2019s motion to suppress. The trial court first found that defendant unequivocally invoked his right to counsel on the porch of his house when he stated, \u201cT would like [to have] an attorney [or something here] present.\u2019\u201d The trial court also found that the conversation at that point should have stopped, but that there \u201cwere some questions that followed after that.\u201d The trial court also found that the statements that defendant made at the house \u201cwere not subject to any kind of coercion or promises!,]\u201d and the court admitted those statements \u201cup to the invocation of rights * * * \u201d The trial court then stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b483-9\">\u201cAnd then later on there\u2019s the conversation that I guess I need to address that occurred behind the trunk. I\u2019m not convinced or persuaded that that conversation was for the defendant\u2019s benefit. That was a private conversation, from the way I understood the testimony. The defendant happened to overhear it. The windows were up. He\u2019s in the backseat. They\u2019re in the trunk. And the conversation is an expression of some surprise on the part of the detectives that the defendant didn\u2019t admit to something that seemed to them was obviously going to be proven.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b483-10\">\u201cThe defendant may have overheard it and taken it for much more than it really was and added his own kind of color to what it meant to him in context of other conversations and created this impression in his own mind. That may or may not be true. I don\u2019t find the defendant to be particularly credible.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b483-11\">\u201cBut in any event, the defendant then initiated freely, voluntarily and intelligently a conversation with the police officers, and in that conversation was reminded of his <em>Miranda </em>warning. There was a lengthy discussion regarding the fact that he had previously invoked his right to a lawyer. He clearly then waived his <em>Miranda </em>rights and Fifth Amendment rights and gave a free, voluntary statement to the police.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b484-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>III. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b484-4\">On appeal, defendant assigns error to the trial court\u2019s denial of his motion to suppress. He argues that the detectives violated his right to remain silent and right to counsel under Article I, section 12, and the Fifth Amendment when they failed to cease questioning him on the porch of his house and when they talked about defendant\u2019s case behind the car at the jail, and that those violations affected the validity of his subsequent waiver of his constitutional rights at the jail.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Defendant also argues that the statements that he made at the jail were based on an implied promise of leniency and therefore involuntary. We address each argument in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-5\">A. <em>Waiver by initiating contact</em></p>\n<p id=\"b484-6\">We first consider whether defendant validly waived his rights at the jail. <em>See State v. Acremant, </em>338 Or 302, 321-24, 108 P3d 1139, <em>cert den, </em>546 US 864 (2005) (determining whether the defendant validly waived his right to counsel where the defendant claimed that the admission of his statements during his penalty trial violated his right against compelled self-incrimination and the right to counsel). To be valid under Article I, section 12, and the Fifth Amendment, <em>\u201ca </em>waiver of the right to counsel must be knowing, intelligent, and voluntary under the totality of the circumstances.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 321 (citing <em>State v. Joslin, </em>332 Or 373, 386, 29 P3d 1112 (2001) (concluding that the defendant\u2019s waiver, \u201calthough voluntary, was not knowingly made and, therefore, was invalid\u201d under Article I, section 12) and <em>Edwards v. Arizona, </em>451 US 477, 482, 101 S Ct 1880, 68 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>L Ed 2d 378 (1981) (applying the Fifth Amendment test)). When reviewing a defendant\u2019s claim regarding the validity of such a waiver, we are bound by a trial court\u2019s findings of historical facts, and we review a trial court\u2019s conclusions concerning the waiver for legal error. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b485-4\">We begin by considering defendant\u2019s state constitutional claim. <em>See State v. Kennedy, </em>295 Or 260, 262, 666 P2d 1316 (1983) (court considers and disposes of questions of state law before reaching federal law claims). As previously noted, Article I, section 12, requires the police to give a defendant who is in custody or in compelling circumstances <em>Miranda-like </em>warnings before questioning. <em>Moore, </em>349 Or at 382 (so stating). Once a suspect asserts the right to counsel, \u201cquestioning not only \u2018should\u2019 but must cease.\u201d <em>State v. Isom, </em>306 Or 587, 593, 761 P2d 524 (1988). After a suspect has asserted the right to counsel, however, \u201cthe suspect remains free to waive that right by initiating further contact with the police.\u201d <em>Acremant, </em>338 Or at 322 (citing <em>State v. Kell, </em>303 Or 89, 95-100, 734 P2d 334 (1987)).</p>\n<p id=\"b485-5\">In this case, the trial court made findings and conclusions that are relevant to our analysis of the waiver issue. First, the trial court concluded that defendant asserted the right to counsel on the porch of defendant\u2019s house when defendant stated, \u201cI would like to have an attorney or something here present.\u201d Second, the trial court concluded that the conversation at that point should have stopped, but found that there \u201cwere some questions that followed after that.\u201d Third, the trial court concluded that the detectives did not violate defendant\u2019s constitutional rights when they talked about the case behind the car at the jail, finding as fact that the detectives had engaged in a \u201cprivate conversation\u201d that was not undertaken \u201cfor the defendant\u2019s benefit.\u201d In addressing defendant\u2019s \u201cimpression\u201d of that conversation, the trial court stated, \u201cI don\u2019t find the defendant to be particularly credible.\u201d The trial court did not err.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-6\">First, taken in context, the statement that defendant made on the porch of his house that he \u201cwould like to have an attorney or something here present\u201d is an unequivocal invocation of the right to counsel because it expressed defendant\u2019s desire to consult with an attorney before continuing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>to speak to the detectives. <em>See Acremant, </em>338 Or at 322 (concluding that the defendant unequivocally invoked his right to counsel by stating, \u201cI think that I do need a lawyer. I do\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b486-4\">Second, the detectives violated defendant\u2019s rights on the porch of his house when they failed to cease questioning him after his unequivocal invocation of rights. Although the detectives appeared to recognize that defendant had invoked his right to counsel by making that statement, the detectives nevertheless continued to probe defendant for information, saying that they knew \u201c89 percent of what there [was] to know about the case\u201d; that they did not \u201ceven really need\u201d defendant\u2019s statement but that \u201cin fairness\u201d to defendant, defendant had \u201cthe right to tell [the detectives his] side\u201d; that defendant could \u201cstick with\u201d his earlier statements regarding W and they would give defendant \u201ca few more seconds to digest that\u201d; and that they would give defendant, who asked if his parole officer knew about the allegation, a \u201c[l]ast chance\u201d to add anything. Although that continued questioning violated the \u201cflat rule\u201d requiring law enforcement officers to cease questioning upon request for counsel, <em>Isom, </em>306 Or at 593, we note that defendant made no incriminating statements in response to that impermissible questioning.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-5\">Third, the detectives did not violate defendant\u2019s rights when they talked about the case behind the car at the jail; in light of the trial court\u2019s factual findings, the detectives\u2019 conversation did not amount to interrogation. The definition of interrogation extends \u201conly to words or actions on the part of police officers that they <em>should have known </em>were reasonably likely to elicit an incriminating response.\u201d <em>Rhode Island v. Innis, </em>446 US 291, 301-02, 100 S Ct 1682, 64 L Ed 2d 297 (1980) (emphasis in original); <em>see State v. Bradbury, </em>80 Or App 613, 616 n 1, 723 P2d 1051, <em>rev den, </em>302 Or 342 (1986) (adopting Innis1s definition of interrogation for the purposes of Article I, section 12). Here, the trial court found that defendant \u201chappened to overhear\u201d a \u201cprivate conversation\u201d that was not undertaken for defendant\u2019s benefit \u2014 that is, was not made with the intent to elicit an incriminating response. We are bound by that finding because it is supported by sufficient evidence in the record. <em>Ehly, </em>317 Or at 75. Hockin testified that he did not think that defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>could hear the conversation and that he did not intend for defendant to hear the conversation. <em>See Innis, </em>446 US at 301-02 n 7 (noting that the intent of the police is not irrelevant because, \u201cwhere a police practice is designed to elicit an incriminating response from the accused, it is unlikely that the practice will not also be one which the police should have known was reasonably likely to have that effect\u201d). Further, based on Hockiris testimony, it appears that the detectives\u2019 conversation was very brief. Under those circumstances, we conclude that there is no evidence that the detectives should have been aware of the fact that defendant was able to overhear them. <em>See id. </em>at 303 (\u201cGiven the fact that the [officers\u2019] entire conversation appears to have consisted of no more than a few offhand remarks, we cannot say that the officers should have known that it was reasonably likely that Innis would so respond.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b487-4\">Nevertheless, because the detectives violated defendant\u2019s rights when they failed to cease questioning defendant on the porch of his house after his unequivocal invocation of rights, we must determine whether that violation affected the validity of defendant\u2019s subsequent waiver of those rights at the jail. Defendant cites <em>State v. Hall, </em>339 Or 7, 115 P3d 908 (2005), to support his argument that his statements at the jail should have been suppressed. In <em>Hall, </em>the Oregon Supreme Court set forth the analytical methodology to determine whether evidence is inadmissible under Article I, section 9, of the Oregon Constitution because it was \u201cobtained after unlawful police conduct or because it would not have been obtained \u2018but for\u2019 unlawful police conduct.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 25. Under <em>Hall, </em>if a defendant can prove the existence of a minimal factual nexus between the evidence sought to be suppressed and prior unlawful police conduct, the burden shifts to the state to show that that evidence \u201cdid not derive from the preceding illegality.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b487-5\">We reject defendant\u2019s argument because it is based on an incorrect understanding of the law. As the Oregon Supreme Court has explained, \u201cThe <em>Hall </em>methodology applies to violations of Article I, section 9. It does not apply to violations of Article I, section 12.\u201d <em>State v. Jarnagin, </em>351 Or 703, 717 n 9, 277 P3d 535 (2012). Accordingly, we do not apply the <em>Hall </em>methodology to the facts of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>Rather than applying <em>Hall, </em>we apply <em>Acremant, </em>a case in which the Oregon Supreme Court held, on facts that are similar to those presented in this case, that the trial court\u2019s admission of the defendant\u2019s statements was not error. 338 Or at 302. In <em>Acremant, </em>the defendant, while being interviewed by the police, initially made no incriminating statements and invoked his right to counsel by saying, \u201cI think that I do need a lawyer. I do.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 318. The detectives then said that they would end the interview if the defendant wished to see a lawyer, but continued to speak with the defendant for approximately 13 more minutes, stating \u201cthat they were \u2018disappointed\u2019 that defendant had elected to terminate the interview, that they were interested in hearing defendant\u2019s side of the story, and that they were curious about defendant\u2019s motive * * <em>Id. </em>The detectives also told the defendant, \u201c [I] f you change your mind and would like to talk to us, you can do so\u201d and finally stated, \u201cWish you luck, bud. I think we\u2019ll be seeing you again, all right.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 319. After being left alone for approximately one hour, the defendant asked to speak to the detectives, was again read <em>Miranda </em>warnings, and made incriminating statements to two different detectives. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b488-4\">The Oregon Supreme Court considered whether, given an intervening violation of the right to counsel, the defendant nonetheless had made a valid waiver of his rights under Article I, section 12, and the Fifth Amendment. In its Article I, section 12, analysis, the court determined that the detectives unlawfully continued the first interview when they failed to cease the interrogation after the defendant unequivocally invoked his right to counsel. The court then noted that the police left the defendant alone after the termination of the first interview; that the defendant reinitiated contact with the police after having no contact for an hour; that the detectives ensured that the defendant understood his constitutional rights before beginning the second interview; and that the defendant confirmed that he understood his rights before making any inculpatory statements. <em>Id. </em>at 323. Accordingly, the court concluded that the detectives\u2019 unlawful conduct did not induce the defendant\u2019s subsequent statements and that the defendant knowingly and voluntarily waived his right to counsel under Article I, section 12. <em>Id. </em>at 323-24.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>Looking to <em>Acremant, </em>we conclude that the detectives\u2019 unlawful failure to cease questioning defendant on the porch of his house after his invocation of rights did not induce defendant\u2019s confession at the jail. First, similar to the defendant in <em>Acremant, </em>defendant here initiated contact with the detectives after an extended break in questioning; defendant was not questioned during the 40-minute transport and was not interviewed at the jail until 8:00 p.m., more than an hour after the first interview concluded. Second, like the detectives in <em>Acremant, </em>Hockin and Lee ensured that defendant understood his rights under Article I, section 12, before beginning the second interview; indeed, after reading defendant <em>Miranda </em>warnings, Hockin underscored defendant\u2019s rights in three different ways: (1) Hockin told defendant, \u201cYou still have a right to an attorney. Just because you\u2019re \u2014 you mentioned one earlier, we terminated the interview, and now you\u2019re saying you want to talk. You can talk, but you can also talk with an attorney\u201d; (2) Regarding the decision whether to talk, Hockin told defendant, \u201cIt\u2019s completely up to you\u201d; and (3) Hockin told defendant that the second interview was \u201cdifferent\u201d and ensured that defendant understood the \u201cimportance\u201d of going through the <em>Miranda </em>warnings. Third, like the defendant in <em>Acremant, </em>defendant here confirmed that he understood his rights before making any incriminating statements. Specifically, at the beginning of the second interview, Hockin asked defendant, \u201cDo you understand your <em>Miranda </em>rights?\u201d and defendant replied, \u201cYeah.\u201d Hockin also asked defendant, \u201cDo you understand why we\u2019re going through all this?\u201d and defendant replied, \u201cYeah.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b489-4\">We next consider whether defendant made a valid waiver of his right to counsel under the Fifth Amendment. The United States Supreme Court has stated, <em>\u201cMiranda </em>itself indicated that the assertion of the right to counsel was a significant event and that once exercised by the accused, \u2018the interrogation must cease until an attorney is present.\u2019\u201d <em>Edwards, </em>451 US at 485 (citing <em>Miranda, </em>384 US at 474). The Court has also held that, after initially being advised of the right to counsel, the accused may validly waive that right and respond to interrogation, but only by initiating \u201cfurther communication, exchanges, or conversations with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>the police.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 484-85. After noting <em>Edwards </em>in <em>Acremant, </em>the Oregon Supreme Court stated that the defendant \u201cdid not make any inculpatory statements in response to [the detectives\u2019] probing after he had invoked his right to counsel\u201d and that the defendant had initiated the second interview. 338 Or at 323. Accordingly, in <em>Acremant, </em>the court concluded that the defendant made a knowing and voluntary waiver of his right to counsel under the Fifth Amendment. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b490-3\">Guided <em>by Acremant, </em>we conclude that defendant in this case knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily waived his right to counsel under the Fifth Amendment. Like the defendant in <em>Acremant, </em>defendant here did not make any incriminating statements in response to the unlawful police prompting on the porch of defendant\u2019s house. Furthermore, like the defendant in <em>Acremant, </em>defendant here later initiated further contact with the detectives in the jail after an extended break, asking, \u201cCan we talk?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b490-4\">In sum, we conclude that the trial court did not err when it rejected defendant\u2019s argument that his statements were tainted by constitutional violations and were therefore inadmissible. Although the detectives violated defendant\u2019s rights when they failed to cease questioning him on the porch of his house after defendant unequivocally invoked his right to counsel, the detectives\u2019 failure to cease questioning defendant on the porch did not induce defendant to later confess at the jail.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-5\">B. <em>Promise of leniency</em></p>\n<p id=\"b490-6\">We now consider whether the statements that defendant made at the jail were inadmissible because they were made in response to an implied promise of leniency and therefore involuntary. When reviewing the voluntariness of a defendant\u2019s statements, we are bound by the trial court\u2019s findings of historical fact, but we independently assess the ultimate determination of voluntariness. <em>Id. </em>at 324; <em>see also State v. Tanner, </em>236 Or App 423, 431, 236 P3d 775 (2010) (citing <em>Acremant </em>and setting forth that standard of review when determining whether the defendant\u2019s statements were voluntary under Article I, section 12).</p>\n<p id=\"b491-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>The test for voluntariness under both Article I, section 12, and the Fifth Amendment is \u201cwhether, under the totality of the circumstances, it is apparent that the \u2018defendant\u2019s will was not overborne and his capacity for self-determination was not critically impaired.\u2019\u201d <em>Acremant, </em>338 Or at 324 (quoting <em>State v. Vu, </em>307 Or 419, 425, 770 P2d 577 (1989) and citing <em>Schneckloth v. Bustamonte, </em>412 US 218, 93 S Ct 2041, 36 L Ed 2d 854 (1973) (Fifth Amendment test)). As we have stated, \u201cSuch a promise need not be express. An implied promise of immunity from prosecution is sufficient to compel suppression of a confession [.]\u201d <em>State v. Pollard, </em>132 Or App 538, 544, 888 P2d 1054, <em>rev den, </em>321 Or 138 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b491-4\">As noted, the trial court first found that the statements that defendant made on the porch of his house \u201cwere not subject to any kind of coercion or promises.\u201d The trial court further found that the conversation that occurred between the detectives behind the car at the jail was not undertaken for defendant\u2019s benefit, and that defendant, who \u201chappened to overhear\u201d the conversation, took it \u201cfor much more than it really was and added his own kind of color to what it meant to him in context of other conversations and created [a wrong] impression in his own mind.\u201d However, the trial court immediately noted, \u201cThat may or may not be true. I don\u2019t find the defendant to be particularly credible.\u201d Finally, the trial court concluded that defendant \u201cgave a free, voluntary statement to the police.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b491-5\">In light of the trial court\u2019s factual findings, which are supported by evidence in the record, we agree with the trial court\u2019s conclusion and reject defendant\u2019s argument that his statements were involuntary. <em>See Acremant, </em>338 Or at 324 (rejecting the defendant\u2019s involuntariness claim where the \u201cfacts [were] insufficient to provide the basis for the conclusion that defendant\u2019s statements were involuntary\u201d). At the conclusion of the interview that occurred at the jail, Lee asked if the detectives had made any promises or offer of a special deal, and defendant replied, \u201cHuh-uh (negative response). No.\u201d Hockin testified that neither he nor Lee had made defendant any promises. Although defendant argues that the detectives offered him a \u201cfree chance\u201d and said that things \u201cwould have been so much easier\u201d for him if he had \u201cjust confessed back at the house,\u201d leading defendant to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>believe that he would obtain a lenient sentence in exchange for his confession, the trial court did not find defendant credible. We conclude that the trial court did not err in determining that defendant\u2019s statements were voluntary \u2014 that under the totality of the circumstances, defendant\u2019s will was not overborne and his capacity for self-determination was not critically impaired.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-4\">IV. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b492-5\">In sum, the trial court did not err when it denied defendant\u2019s motion to suppress the statements that defendant made at the jail. We conclude that, despite the violation of defendant\u2019s rights under Article I, section 12, and the Fifth Amendment that occurred when the detectives failed to cease questioning defendant on the porch of defendant\u2019s house after defendant had invoked his right to counsel, defendant, at the jail, knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily waived those rights. We also conclude that defendant\u2019s statements were not made in response to an implied promise of leniency and were not involuntary but were made voluntarily.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b478-7\"> Article I, section 12, provides, in part, \u201cNo person shall be *** compelled in any criminal prosecution to testify against himself.\u201d The right against self-incrimination, as provided by Article I, section 12, includes the \u201cderivative right\u201d to the assistance of counsel during custodial interrogation. <em>State v.

Moore/Coen, </em>349 Or 371, 382, 245 P3d 101 (2010), <em>cert </em>den,___US___(2011). Accordingly, Article I, section 12, requires the police to give a defendant who is in custody Miranda-like warnings prior to questioning. <em>Id. </em>Article I, section 12, also requires the police to give a defendant Miranda-like warnings when the defendant is \u201cin circumstances that, although they do not rise to the level of full custody, nevertheless create a setting which judges would and officers should recognize to be compelling.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b484-7\"> Defendant\u2019s argument is predicated upon the underlying contention that \u201cthe <em>Miranda </em>warnings that police did provide were in fact required to be provided.\u201d The state does not argue that <em>Miranda </em>warnings were not required on the porch of defendant\u2019s house and concedes that defendant unequivocally invoked the right to counsel on the porch of defendant\u2019s house. <em>See State v.

Accordingly, we assume without deciding that defendant was in compelling circumstances on the porch of his house when he unequivocally invoked his constitutional rights. <em>See State v. Anderson, </em>175 Or App 464, 470 n 2, 28 P3d 662 (2001) (assuming without deciding, based on state\u2019s concession, that defendant was in compelling circumstances or custody when questioned by police).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
