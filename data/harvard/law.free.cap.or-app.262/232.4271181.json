In his first assignment of error, petitioner asserts that the post-conviction court erred in failing to consider his request for court assistance under <em>Church v. Gladden, </em>244 Or 308, 311-12, 417 P2d 993 (1966) (requiring post-conviction petitioner to \u201cinform the court at first opportunity of his attorney\u2019s failure and ask to have him replaced, or ask to have him instructed by the court to carry out petitioner\u2019s request\u201d). Defendant concedes that the court so erred, and we agree. On August 25, 2011, petitioner filed a notice pursuant to <em>Church v. Gladden, </em>in which he asserted concerns about his post-conviction counsel\u2019s <em>performance </em>\u2014 viz., failing to amend the original post-conviction petition to include new, valid claims; failing to conduct necessary investigation; and failing to properly respond to defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss \u2014 and requested that counsel be replaced or instructed by the court to adequately litigate petitioner\u2019s claims. On September 14, 2011, the post-conviction court granted defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss petitioner\u2019s post-conviction claim without having addressed petitioner\u2019s August 25 <em>Church v. Gladden </em>notice. We agree with defendant that that was error, and we reverse and remand on that basis. Given that disposition, we need not address petitioner\u2019s other assignments of error.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b253-5\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b253-6\"> In his second assignment of error, petitioner contends that the post-conviction court erred in granting defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss. Petitioner also asserts, in a supplemental <em>pro se </em>brief, that the post-conviction court erred by failing to grant relief on a claim that the \u201ctrial court erred in denying Petitioner\u2019s motion to dismiss [the underlying criminal case] on grounds of the pre-indictment delay without making a proper record [for] such delay.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
