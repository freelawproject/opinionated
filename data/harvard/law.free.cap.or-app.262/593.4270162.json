J.</author>\n<p id=\"b614-4\">Petitioner seeks judicial review of an order of the Board of Parole and Post-Prison Supervision (the board), contending that, following the revocation of his parole, the board lacked authority under the applicable statutes and rules to incarcerate him for 30 months and that, although we have case law to the contrary, <em>see, e.g., State ex rel Gonzalez v. Washington, </em>182 Or App 112, 47 P3d 537 (2002), \u201call of the premises upon which it stands are demonstrably inaccurate.\u201d We need not resolve the merits of petitioner\u2019s contention because, as we will explain, this judicial review proceeding is moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-5\">The pertinent facts are procedural and undisputed. On March 25, 1986, petitioner committed the crimes of attempted first-degree kidnapping and attempted first-degree rape. In January 1987, the trial court sentenced petitioner to a term of imprisonment that was not to exceed 30 years. Petitioner was released on parole in July 1998, but it was revoked in September 1999. Petitioner was again released on parole in September 2009, and the board again revoked it in August 2010. The board imposed a 30-month term of incarceration and reset petitioner\u2019s parole release date. After the board issued its order on administrative review embodying those rulings in early 2012, petitioner timely sought judicial review, challenging the 30-month term of incarceration imposed by the board. Thereafter, in November 2012, petitioner was again released on parole.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-6\">The parties completed their briefing and oral argument was scheduled for February 26, 2014.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The day before oral argument, at a hearing before the board, petitioner\u2019s parole officer recommended that, as a result of petitioner\u2019s violations, the board extend petitioner\u2019s parole to the expiration of his indeterminate sentence \u2014 that is, October 2, 2016. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>Thereafter, on March 11, 2014, the board issued an order extending petitioner\u2019s parole as recommended.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-4\">Petitioner contends that this judicial review is not moot because collateral consequences flow from the board\u2019s unlawful decision to impose 30 months\u2019 incarceration following his 2010 revocation. The gravamen of those contentions is necessarily based on the premises that, if the board had correctly applied the governing statutes and rules, petitioner would have been released on parole 14 months earlier and, thus, would have been discharged from parole a year later or, alternatively, his parole status would have changed from active to inactive at that time. As we explain, the premises underlying petitioner\u2019s contentions are unavailing under existing case law.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-5\">\u201c [T]he parole system allows the [b]oard to release an inmate who has not finished serving his or her indeterminate prison sentence, and that person may be kept on parole <em>until the sentence expires.\u201d Barnes v. Thompson, </em>159 Or App 383, 385, 977 P2d 431, <em>rev den, </em>329 Or 447 (1999) (emphasis added). A petitioner\u2019s discharge from parole requires \u201csome action on the part of the board\u201d and does not occur \u201cby operation of law\u201d because the board fails to act by the tentative parole discharge date. <em>Haskins v. Palmateer, </em>186 Or App 159, 168, 63 P3d 31, <em>rev den, </em>335 Or 510 (2003); <em>see also Thomas v. Board of Parole, </em>186 Or App 170, 173, 63 P3d 29, <em>rev den, </em>335 Or 510 (2003) (applying statute and rules in effect at the time of the petitioner\u2019s crimes in 1985 and 1986; holding that, \u201cas was the case in <em>Haskins, </em>the rules did not provide for discharge by inaction or by operation of law\u201d). Further, \u201can earlier commencement of active parole supervision does not ensure an earlier discharge from parole.\u201d <em>Green v. Baldwin, </em>204 Or App 351, 354-55, 129 P3d 734 (2006); <em>see also Odle v. Thompson, </em>174 Or App 506, 26 P3d 177 (2001) (rejecting argument that appeal was not moot because the board\u2019s delay in releasing the petitioner effectively delayed his transfer from active to inactive parole).</p>\n<p id=\"b615-6\">Although petitioner contends that aspects of that existing case law are clearly wrong, we decline the invitation to revisit them. Accordingly, we conclude that, because petitioner\u2019s demonstration of collateral consequences is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>predicated on premises that are legally incorrect, petitioner\u2019s judicial review challenging the board\u2019s imposition of 30 months\u2019 incarceration following his 2010 revocation is moot in light of his release in November 2012.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-4\">Petition for judicial review dismissed as moot.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b614-7\"> We note that, after petitioner filed his opening brief, the board filed a notice of probable mootness, contending that the judicial review was moot because of petitioner\u2019s recent release. The Appellate Commissioner issued an order in which he declined to dismiss the judicial review as moot. Although the issue was resolved against the board, it raised the issue again in its answering brief on appeal. <em>See </em>ORAP 7.15(3) (providing that, \u201c[i]f any motion other than a challenge to the court\u2019s jurisdiction is denied before submission of the case, the motion may not be resubmitted without leave of the court in the order on the motion\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
