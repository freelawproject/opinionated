At trial, the state presented evidence that defendant took pain medication on the day of his arrest, but the state failed to identify that medication or offer evidence that the medication made defendant more susceptible to the effects of alcohol. Over defendant\u2019s objection, the trial court gave the jury an instruction based on <em>State v. </em>Miles, 8 Or App 189, 196-97, 492 P2d 497, <em>rev den </em>(1972), as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b608-5\">\u201cIf you find from the evidence that [defendant] was in such a physical condition that he was more susceptible to the influence of intoxicants than he would otherwise be, and as a result of being in that physical condition [defendant] became under the influence of a lesser quantity of intoxicants than [it] would otherwise take [defendant] is nevertheless Under the Influence of Intoxicants.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b608-6\">On appeal, defendant argues, and the state concedes, that the trial court erred in giving the <em>Miles </em>instruction and that the error requires reversal of defendant\u2019s DUII conviction. We agree and accept the state\u2019s concession. <em>See State v. Rich, </em>259 Or App 655, 656, 314 P3d 979 (2013) (reversing and remanding for a new trial where \u201cthere was no evidence from which the jury could find that [the] defendant\u2019s physical condition exacerbated the effects of alcohol because evidence that [the] defendant took pain medication for a bad knee was insufficient, without more, for the jury to make such an inference\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b608-7\">Defendant also argues, without citation to any authority, that the trial court\u2019s error requires reversal of his convictions for reckless driving and second-degree criminal mischief. We reject that argument without discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-8\">Reversed and remanded on Count 1; otherwise affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
