We agree with respondent that the evidence is not sufficient to support the SPO, and we therefore reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-5\">Although respondent requests <em>de novo </em>review, we do not view this as an \u201cexceptional case\u201d in which <em>de novo </em>review is appropriate. ORS 19.415(3) (providing for <em>de novo </em>review at the court\u2019s discretion); ORAP 5.40(8)(c) (\u201cThe Court of Appeals will exercise its discretion to try the cause anew on the record or to make one or more factual findings anew on the record only in exceptional cases.\u201d). Therefore, \u201cwe review the facts for any evidence and the legal conclusions based on those facts for errors of law.\u201d <em>Brown v. Roach, </em>249 Or App 579, 580, 277 P3d 628 (2012) (citations and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b430-6\">We state the facts consistently with that standard. Petitioner and respondent were previously in a romantic relationship and have a son, J. At a hearing before the trial court, petitioner presented evidence of contact by respondent on four separate dates. In April 2011, respondent and his mother arrived at petitioner\u2019s home to pick up J for supervised visitation. Petitioner testified that respondent engaged her in \u201cnegative conversation\u201d about J\u2019s haircut. She asked respondent to stop and retreated into the garage with J. Respondent followed petitioner and J into the garage, \u201cscreaming and yelling, coming towards us, advancing on us.\u201d Petitioner testified that she was apprehensive because of previous incidents in 2003 and 2004 (seven and eight years earlier) during which respondent had physically abused her.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-7\">Petitioner testified that, in June 2011, respondent repeatedly called and texted her regarding J and threatened to call the police and the Department of Human Services (DHS) if she failed to respond. When petitioner did not respond, respondent drove by her house and had the Keizer Police Department perform a welfare check on the residence.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-8\">On September 3, 2011, respondent and his mother came to petitioner\u2019s home to pick up J. Petitioner accused <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>respondent of engaging in unsupervised time with J. Petitioner testified that respondent \u201cadvanced toward me at the step and stated that he wished I was dead. And I asked him and his mother to leave and [told him] that he would not be taking our son, he then again verbally started accosting me, and got in the car and left.\u201d Petitioner testified that she was afraid because of previous instances of physical abuse.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-4\">Finally, petitioner testified that, on September 12-13, 2011, respondent issued a missing child report for J and left messages with petitioner threatening to attempt to gain custody if she failed to return his calls within 15 minutes. According to petitioner, the messages stated that \u201cpeople had driven by [petitioner\u2019s] house *** that could confirm [she] was home now, and that [respondent] needed to know where [J] was.\u201d Petitioner testified that, in light of previous instances of physical abuse by respondent, the messages alarmed her.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-5\">Petitioner also testified that respondent was \u201cnot allowed to have contact with us unless it has to do with [J]\u201d and that she had repeatedly asked respondent not to contact her unless it concerned J. Petitioner requested the SPO after receiving respondent\u2019s messages on September 13, 2011.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-6\">The trial court entered a permanent SPO under ORS 30.866. This appeal followed. In his sole assignment of error, respondent argues that the evidence was insufficient to support entry of the SPO because (1) two of the contacts were speech-based contacts that do not meet the test established in <em>State v. Rangel, </em>328 Or 294, 977 P2d 379 (1999)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>; (2) the two remaining contacts were permitted by petitioner and, thus, were not unwanted; and (3) even if the two remaining contacts were unwanted, respondent was not reckless with respect to the unwanted nature of those contacts.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-7\">\u201cIn order for an SPO to issue, a petitioner must show, by a preponderance of the evidence, intentional, knowing, or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>reckless conduct by the respondent against the petitioner or <em>\u2018a </em>member of [her] immediate family or household\u2019 that constitutes \u2018repeated and unwanted contact.\u2019\u201d <em>Brown, </em>249 Or App at 583 (quoting ORS 30.866(l)(a)). \u201cRepeated\u201d means two or more times in the previous two years. ORS 30.866(6); ORS 163.730(7). \u201cContact\u201d includes, among other things, \u201ccoming into the person\u2019s visual or physical presence, following the person, waiting outside the person\u2019s home, property, place of work or school, or sending or making written communications of any kind.\u201d <em>Pinkham v. Brubaker, </em>178 Or App 360, 369, 37 P3d 186 (2001); see ORS 163.730(3). A petitioner must also show that she was subjectively \u201calarmed\u201d or \u201ccoerced\u201d by the contacts and that the alarm or coercion was objectively reasonable for \u201ca person in the victim\u2019s situation.\u201d <em>Brown, </em>249 Or App at 583; <em>see </em>ORS 30.866(1) - (2). Finally, the petitioner must show that \u201cthe contacts, cumulatively, caused her reasonably to fear for her personal safety.\u201d <em>Bryant v. Walker, </em>190 Or App 253, 256, 78 P3d 148 (2003), <em>rev dismissed as improvidently allowed, </em>337 Or 585 (2004); <em>see </em>ORS 30.866(1)(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b432-4\">In the case of an alleged speech-based contact, Article I, section 8, of the Oregon Constitution requires the petitioner to prove that the contact constitutes a threat\u2014 that is, \u201ca communication that instills in the addressee a fear of imminent and serious personal violence from the speaker, is unequivocal, and is objectively likely to be followed by unlawful acts.\u201d <em>Rangel, </em>328 Or at 303. The threat must be \u201cso unambiguous, unequivocal, and specific to the addressee that it convincingly expresses <em>to the addressee </em>the intention that it will be carried out * * * and that the actor has the ability to do so.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 306 (emphasis in original). Threats do not include \u201cthe kind of hyperbole, rhetorical excesses, and impotent expressions of anger or frustration that in some contexts can be privileged even if they alarm the addressee.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 303 (quoting <em>State v. Moyle, </em>299 Or 691, 705, 705 P2d 740 (1985)).</p>\n<p id=\"b432-5\">With those principles in mind, we conclude that the June, September 3, and September 12-13 incidents are not qualifying contacts for purposes of ORS 30.866. Because at least two qualifying contacts are required for issuance of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>an SPO, we need not, and do not, address whether the April incident is a qualifying contact.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-3\">We analyze the June and September 12-13 incidents together because of their factual similarities. In June, respondent repeatedly called and texted petitioner regarding J and threatened to call the police and DHS if she did not respond. On September 12-13, respondent threatened to attempt to win custody of J if petitioner did not immediately return his calls regarding J\u2019s welfare. Because defendant\u2019s actions during those incidents were communicative, they must meet Rangel\u2019s more stringent requirements before they may be considered qualifying contacts for purposes of ORS 30.866. <em>Christensen v. Carter/Bosket, </em>261 Or App 133, 140-41, 323 P3d 348 (2014). We conclude that they do not. Respondent \u201cthreatened\u201d to use legal means, such as the police, DHS, and judicial process, to ensure J\u2019s welfare. Respondent did not threaten violence, much less \u201cimminent and serious personal violence.\u201d <em>Rangel, </em>328 Or at 303. Moreover, respondent\u2019s \u201cthreats\u201d \u2014 which involved only lawful methods \u2014 did not indicate that he was likely to resort to unlawful acts. <em>See Noriega v. Parsons, </em>253 Or App 768, 771, 775, 296 P3d 522 (2012) (respondent\u2019s text messages to petitioner, in which he threatened to \u201cstop being so nice\u201d and to confront her at work, did not indicate that he intended to carry out any threats implicit in his messages, or that he was likely to engage in violence or other unlawful acts); <em>Goodness v. Beckham, </em>224 Or App 565, 578, 198 P3d 980 (2008) (respondent\u2019s e-mail threatened legal action, not imminent violence, and, therefore, was insufficient to support an SPO under <em>Rangel). </em>Thus, we cannot conclude that the June and September 12-13 incidents instilled in petitioner an objectively reasonable fear of imminent and serious personal violence from respondent, nor that they were objectively likely to be followed by unlawful acts. <em>See Rangel, </em>328 Or at 303. Thus, neither the June nor the September 12-13 incident is a qualifying contact for the purposes of ORS 30.866.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-4\">On September 3, 2011, respondent told petitioner, \u201cI wish you were dead\u201d after she accused him of spending unsupervised time with J. Respondent advanced toward petitioner, and she asked him to leave. He then \u201cverbally <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>*** accosted\u201d petitioner and drove away.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We conclude that respondent\u2019s statement to petitioner, \u201cI wish you were dead,\u201d is more akin to an \u201cimpotent expression [] of anger or frustration\u201d than \u201ca communication that instills in the addressee a fear of imminent and serious personal violence from the speaker, is unequivocal, and is objectively likely to be followed by unlawful acts.\u201d <em>Rangel, </em>328 Or at 303; <em>Jennings v. Gifford, </em>211 Or App 192, 196, 154 P3d 163 (2007) (telling the petitioner to \u201cgo to hell\u201d over the phone did not constitute an unequivocal threat that instilled in the petitioner an objectively reasonable fear of imminent and serious personal violence). Thus, respondent\u2019s statement to petitioner that \u201cI wish you were dead\u201d is not a qualifying contact for purposes of ORS 30.866. We also conclude that the record fails to establish that any noncommunicative actions that defendant took toward petitioner during the September 3 incident would have given rise to objectively reasonable alarm. All the record shows is that respondent moved toward petitioner, she told him to leave, and he left. <em>See Christensen, </em>261 Or App at 142-43 (noncommunicative portion of the respondent\u2019s conduct during a particular incident \u2014 shaking his clenched fists at the petitioner \u2014 did not give rise to objectively reasonable alarm); <em>Brown, </em>249 Or App at 584 n 3 (noncommunicative portion of the respondent\u2019s conduct during a particular incident \u2014 running up to the petitioner aggressively \u2014 did not give rise to objectively reasonable alarm).</p>\n<p id=\"b434-4\">Because the April 2011 incident is the only remaining possible contact and two or more contacts are required, there was insufficient evidence to support the issuance of the SPO.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-5\">Reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b431-8\"> Although respondent characterizes the speech-related contacts as constituting two contacts, respondent actually describes speech-related acts that occurred on three separate dates (contacting petitioner regarding J\u2019s welfare in June 2011 and on September 12-13, 2011, and telling petitioner that he wished she were dead on September 3, 2011).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b434-6\"> Without knowing any details regarding the verbal accosting, we are unable to evaluate whether it satisfied the <em>Rangel </em>standard.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
