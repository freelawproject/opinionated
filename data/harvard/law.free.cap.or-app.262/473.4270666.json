J.</author>\n<p id=\"b495-4\">Defendant appeals two of his convictions for sex-crimes he committed while he was a recruiter for the Oregon Army National Guard.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> One of his convictions was for attempted first-degree sexual abuse under ORS 163.427 (l)(a)(B), which applies only when the perpetrator uses \u201cforcible compulsion.\u201d On appeal, defendant argues that, on the undisputed facts, the state did not prove that element. Another conviction was for coercion under ORS 163.275(l)(g), which applies only when a \u201cpublic servant\u201d unlawfully coerces a victim. Defendant contends that, as used in that statute, the term \u201cpublic servant\u201d means only a public servant who works for the state or a local governmental unit, and there is no evidence that the Oregon Army National Guard is such an entity. He also argues that, if he was a public servant, then the court erred in enhancing his sentence on the basis of the \u201cviolation of public trust\u201d factor, OAR 213-008-0002 (l)(b)(F), because that enhancement factor was already captured by the \u201cpublic servant\u201d element of the coercion crime. We conclude that the state presented evidence sufficient to establish that defendant attempted to use forcible compulsion; that he was a public servant for purposes of the coercion statute; and that, although the court erred in applying the \u201cviolation of public trust\u201d enhancement factor, that error was harmless, because defendant was also sentenced to a concurrent term for a conviction that he does not appeal. We therefore affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-5\">I. FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b495-6\">The facts, which we relate in the light most favorable to the state because a jury returned guilty verdicts, <em>State v. </em>Johnson, 342 Or 596, 598, 157 P3d 198 (2007), <em>cert den, </em>552 US 1113 (2008), are as follows. R encountered defendant in 2010 when she was applying to join the Oregon Army National Guard and met with defendant several times to fill out paperwork. During one of those meetings, defendant asked R about her sexual history. Although the questions made her uncomfortable, R answered them because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>she believed that they were part of a standard recruitment questionnaire. Defendant then asked R if she would like a National Guard t-shirt. She said that she would, and defendant led her into a storage room. Once they were alone, defendant put his leg up on a box, motioned towards his genitals, and asked R how \u201cadventurous\u201d she was. She then tried to leave the room, but defendant stepped in front of her. Defendant then exposed himself, grabbed R\u2019s arm \u201cvery aggressively,\u201d and attempted to make her touch his penis. R was able to break his grip and leave the storage room.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-4\">Defendant caught up to R in the drill hall and again blocked her exit. He told her that she could not leave unless she showed him her breasts. At that point, R became \u201cfrightened.\u201d She lifted her shirt and defendant grabbed her breasts. R then pulled her shirt back down and began to walk away, intending to leave the building. Defendant, however, told her that she needed to sign more papers. She followed defendant back to his office and finished signing the papers. While she was in his office, defendant closed the door and again asked R to show him her breasts. R did so and then left the office. R\u2019s arm developed bruises where defendant had grabbed her.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-5\">R discussed what had happened with a friend but did not immediately report defendant because she was concerned that doing so might affect her chances of joining the guard. R returned to the armory every day for the rest of the week to work out in the gym and to fill out more paperwork, but she always brought friends because she was afraid of defendant. Nevertheless, at one point, R had to go into defendant\u2019s office to fill out documents related to her \u201cfamily care plan.\u201d When they were alone, defendant again asked to see R\u2019s breasts. R declined and left the room. The day after that incident, R reported it to the Linn County Sheriffs Office, and defendant was subsequently arrested.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-6\">II. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b496-7\">After a jury trial, defendant was convicted of, among other offenses, one count of attempted first-degree sexual abuse, ORS 163.427(l)(a)(B), and one count of coercion, ORS 163.275(l)(g). On appeal, defendant assigns error <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>to five rulings, three of which merit discussion.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> First, defendant assigns error to the denial of his motion for judgment of acquittal (MJOA) on the charge of first-degree attempted sexual abuse, arguing that the state failed to establish that his action involved forcible compulsion. Second, he argues that the trial court erred by denying his MJOA on the charge of coercion by a public servant. According to defendant, a \u201cpublic servant\u201d is a person who works for the state or for a local governmental entity. Third, defendant argues that the trial court erred by imposing an upward departure sentence for his conviction of coercion by a public servant because the factor that the court used for the enhancement was also an element of the underlying crime. We address those arguments in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-4\">A. <em>Forcible compulsion</em></p>\n<p id=\"b497-5\">Defendant was convicted of attempted first-degree sexual abuse on the theory that he tried \u201cto cause [R] to touch defendant\u2019s penis by means of forcible compulsion [.]\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> On appeal, he argues that the court erred in denying his MJOA on that count.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> For the following reason, we reject that argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-6\">To use forcible compulsion is to \u201ccompel by *** [p]hysical force.\u201d ORS 163.305(2). A person is guilty of the attempted version of a crime when that person \u201cintentionally <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>engages in conduct which constitutes a substantial step towards commission of the crime.\u201d ORS 161.405(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b498-4\">On appeal, defendant relies on <em>State v. Marshall, </em>350 Or 208, 253 P3d 1017 (2011), in which the Supreme Court explained what the state must prove in order to obtain a conviction for the <em>completed </em>crime of first-degree sexual abuse based on a forcible compulsion theory. As the court explained,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b498-5\">\u201cwhen the state elects to prove the \u2018forcible compulsion\u2019 element of a charge of first-degree sexual abuse by evidence of physical force, it must show that the physical force that the defendant used was greater in degree or different in kind from the simple movement and contact that is inherent in the act of touching the intimate part of another and that the force was sufficient to compel the victim to submit to or engage in the sexual contact, against the victim\u2019s will.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b498-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 227. Citing that standard, defendant, while apparently conceding that he used an amount of force that was greater than the normal movement inherent in noncriminal sexual acts, argues that the force he used could not have been sufficient to compel R to submit to sexual contact because there was no sexual contact. Defendant\u2019s argument, however, ignores the fact that he was convicted of <em>attempted </em>first-degree sexual abuse. Thus, the state was required to prove only that defendant took a \u201csubstantial step\u201d towards forcibly compelling R to engage in sexual contact. To constitute a \u201csubstantial step\u201d towards the commission of a charged offense, a defendant\u2019s conduct must \u201c(1) advance the criminal purpose charged and (2) provide some verification of the existence of that purpose.\u201d <em>State v. Walters, </em>311 Or 80, 85, 804 P2d 1164, <em>cert den, </em>501 US 1209 (1991). Here, the record establishes that defendant exposed his penis, stepped in front of R, and \u201cvery aggressively\u201d grabbed her with enough force to leave bruises on her arm. Moreover, R testified that she had to use a martial arts technique in order to avoid touching defendant\u2019s penis. That is evidence from which a rational trier of fact could conclude that defendant\u2019s purpose was to forcibly compel R to touch his penis and that he took steps to advance that purpose, using force that was \u201cgreater in degree * * * from the simple movement and contact that is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>inherent in the act of touching the intimate part of another.\u201d <em>Marshall, </em>350 Or at 227.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-4\">B. <em>\u201cPublic servant\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b499-5\">ORS 163.275 provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b499-6\">\u201c(1) A person commits the crime of coercion when the person compels or induces another person to engage in conduct from which the other person has a legal right to abstain * * * by means of instilling in the other person a fear that, if the other person refrains from the conduct compelled or induced or engages in conduct contrary to the compulsion or inducement, the actor or another will:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b499-7\">;J\u00ed \u00edf\u00ed \u00edJ\u00ed</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b499-8\">\u201c(g) Unlawfully use or abuse <em>the person\u2019s position as a public servant </em>by performing some act within or related to official duties, or by failing or refusing to perform an official duty, in such manner as to affect some person adversely.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b499-9\">(Emphasis added.) On appeal, defendant argues that the state failed to establish that he was a \u201cpublic servant.\u201d That is so, argues defendant, because the definition of \u201cpublic servant\u201d encompasses only individuals who are connected with the state or local governmental entities. His argument is elaborate. He relies not on the text of the coercion statute, which does not define \u201cpublic servant,\u201d but on a definition of that term in what he refers to as a related statute: ORS 162.005(2), which defines \u201cpublic servant\u201d for the purposes of ORS chapter 162 (\u201cOffenses Against the State and Public Justice\u201d). That definition provides in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b499-10\">\u201c\u2018Public servant\u2019 means:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b499-11\">\u201c(a) A public official as defined in ORS 244.020;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b499-12\">\u201c(b) A person serving as an advisor, consultant or assistant at the request or direction of the state, any political subdivision thereof or of any governmental instrumentality within the state [.]\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b499-13\">ORS 244.020(14), in turn, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b499-14\">\u201c \u2018Public official\u2019 means any person who, when an alleged violation of this chapter occurs, is serving the State of Oregon or any of its political subdivisions or any other public body as defined in ORS 174.109 [(i.e., state government <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>bodies, local government bodies and special government bodies)] as an elected official, appointed official, employee or agent, irrespective of whether the person is compensated for the services.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b500-4\">Defendant argues that ORS 162.005(2)(a) does not encompass federal employees, because all of the persons listed in that subparagraph must be either \u201cserving the State of Oregon\u201d or serving a public body as defined in ORS 174.109, <em>i.e., </em>\u201cstate government bodies, local government bodies and special government bodies.\u201d ORS 162.005(b), which may include federal employees by referring to \u201cany governmental instrumentality within the state [,]\u201d does not apply to him, he contends, because he was not an \u201cadvisor, consultant or assistant.\u201d Thus, according to defendant, because his position as a recruiter for the Oregon National Guard was arguably a federal government position, he was not affiliated with the state or any local government, so he was not a \u201cpublic servant\u201d for purposes of the \u201ccoercion by a public servant\u201d statute, and the court should have granted his MJOA on that charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-5\">We are not persuaded. Defendant\u2019s argument requires us to determine the meaning of the statutory term \u201cpublic servant.\u201d Our goal in statutory interpretation is to determine the legislature\u2019s intent. <em>State v. Gaines, </em>346 Or 160, 171, 206 P3d 1042 (2009). The best evidence of legislative intent is the text of the statute itself. <em>Id. </em>When the legislature has not defined a term, we give that term its ordinary meaning. <em>State v. Kimble/Berkner, </em>236 Or App 613, 618, 237 P3d 871 (2010). Nothing in ordinary usage of the term \u201cpublic servant\u201d provides any support for the contention that it encompasses only state and local officers; in normal discourse, in other words, a public servant is a public servant regardless of the level or branch of government in which he or she serves.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-6\">Nor are we persuaded by defendant\u2019s argument based on the definition in the supposedly related statute, ORS 162.005. That argument is premised on the maxim that Oregon courts \u201cordinarily assume that the legislature uses terms in <em>related statutes </em>consistently.\u201d <em>State v. Cloutier, </em>351 Or 68, 99, 261 P3d 1234 (2011) (emphasis added). In <em>Cloutier, </em>the Supreme Court was tasked with interpreting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>the meaning of the phrase \u201cthe maximum allowable by law\u201d as it appears in ORS 138.050. <em>Id. </em>at 70. The court noted that ORS 138.050 is \u201cbut a part of a larger statutory scheme\u201d and turned to \u201crelated sentencing statutes\u201d for guidance. <em>Id. </em>at 75-76. ORS 162.005 and ORS 163.275 are <em>not </em>part of the same \u201clarger statutory scheme.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 75. Although both are criminal statutes, they come from two different chapters of the criminal code and address different categories of harms. ORS 162.005 expressly states that the definition applies only \u201c[a]s used in ORS 162.005 to 162.425, unless the context requires otherwise!.]\u201d <em>See Enertrol Power Monitoring Corp. v. State of Oregon, </em>314 Or 78, 84, 836 P2d 123 (1992) (\u201cThe legislature\u2019s definition of a term made applicable to one portion of the statutes does not control on the meaning of the term in another portion of the statutes.\u201d). Nothing in the coercion statute \u201crequires\u201d application of a definition from ORS 162.005 or even suggests that such application is appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-4\">To the contrary, the two statutes have significantly <em>different </em>contexts. ORS 162.005(2)(a) appears in the context of statutes pertaining to government ethics and public integrity and was enacted in its present form with an omnibus bill dealing with the Oregon Government Ethics Commission. <em>See </em>HB 2595 (2007) (Relating clause: \u201cRelating to government ethics [.]\u201d). In that context, it makes sense to limit the applicability of the definition of \u201cpublic servant\u201d to state actors; the ethical conduct of federal actors is generally regulated by federal authorities. On the other hand, the coercion statute focuses on the harm inflicted by persons in positions of public authority who threaten to use that position to coerce an individual, and the harm does not vary according to which public office gives force to the threat.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-5\">In any event, even if ORS 162.005(2)(a) were a statute whose definition section could shed light on what the legislature intended when using the term \u201cpublic servant\u201d in ORS 163.275, that does not support defendant\u2019s theory. As the state explains (and we concur),</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b501-6\">\u201cORS 162.005(2)(a) *** was enacted <em>after </em>the enactment of ORS 163.275, the coercion statute. Statutory provisions that did not exist at the time are not relevant context in the determination of what the legislature intended when it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>enacted a statute. <em>Stull v. Hoke, </em>326 Or 72, 79-80, 948 P2d 722 (1997). ORS 163.275, defining [\u2018public servant\u2019 for purposes of] coercion, and ORS 162.005, defining \u2018public servant\u2019 for purposes of Chapter 162, both were enacted in 1971. Or Laws 1971, ch 743, \u00a7\u00a7102, 178. But ORS 162.005(2)(a), on which defendant relies, was revised in 2007. Or Laws 2007, ch 865, \u00a7 22. That later revision tells us nothing about what the legislature intended when it included the phrase \u2018public servant\u2019 in the coercion statute in 1971. In fact, the original version, enacted at the same time as ORS 163.275, did not exclude federal officials from the definition of\u2018public servant.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b502-5\">\u201cBefore it was revised in 2007, *** ORS 162.005(2)(a) (2005), defined a public servant as a \u2018public officer or employee of the state or of any political subdivision thereof or of any governmental instrumentality within the state [.] ***\u2019 Accordingly, if this court were to look to ORS 162.005(2)(a) as context for defining \u2018public servant\u2019 for purposes of the coercion statute, the relevant contextual evidence for the legislature\u2019s intent is that contained in the original version, not in the 2007 version. <em>See Holcomb v. Sunderland, </em>321 Or 99, 105, 894 P2d 457 (1995) (\u2018The proper inquiry focuses on what the legislature intended at the time of enactment and discounts later events.\u2019). Under the 1971 definition, defendant *** was clearly an employee of a \u2018governmental instrumentality within the state,\u2019 * * * regardless of whether he was employed by the state or federal government.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b502-6\">(Emphasis in original.)</p>\n<p id=\"b502-7\">As the state points out, the definition of \u201cpublic servant\u201d in the original version of ORS 162.005(2)(a) did not define the term so as to include individuals connected with state governmental entities while excluding those who are connected to the federal government. As originally drafted by the Oregon Criminal Law Revision Commission and passed by the legislature, the definition section for what would become ORS chapter 162 stated, in part,</p>\n<p id=\"b502-8\">\u201c\u2018Public servant\u2019 <em>includes:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b502-9\">\u201c(a) A public officer or employee of the state or of any political subdivision thereof or of any governmental instrumentality within the state;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b503-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>\u201c(b) A person serving as an advisor, consultant or assistant at the request or direction of the state, any political subdivision thereof or of any governmental instrumentality within the state [.]\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b503-4\">ORS 162.005(2) (1971) (emphasis added). In the 2007 amendment, ORS 162.005 changed from defining \u201cpublic servant\u201d in terms of what that phrase \u201cincludes\u201d to defining \u201cpublic servant\u201d in terms of what that phrase \u201cmeans.\u201d Generally, the legislature intends something quite different when it says a particular statutory term \u201cmeans\u201d something as opposed to when it says that a term \u201cincludes\u201d something. \u201c\u2018Means\u2019 is used in the definition if the definition restricts or limits the meaning of a word. \u2018Includes\u2019 is used if the definition extends the meaning.\u201d Office of Legislative Counsel, <em>Bill Drafting Manual </em>\u00a7 7.2 (2012); <em>accord Edwards v. Riverdale School District, </em>220 Or App 509, 514-15, 188 P3d 317 (2008), <em>rev dismissed, </em>346 Or 66 (2009). As in <em>Edwards, </em>the legislature\u2019s use of the term \u201cincludes\u201d in ORS 162.005 (1971) is evidence that it intended the enumerated examples to be open-ended rather than exclusive.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-5\">Because ORS 162.005 (1971) does not help explain what the term \u201cpublic servant\u201d means, we apply the ordinary definition of the term. <em>Webster\u2019s </em>defines \u201cpublic servant\u201d as either \u201ca holder of public office\u201d or \u201can individual or corporation *** rendering a public service.\u201d <em>Webster\u2019s Third New Int\u2019l Dictionary </em>1836 (unabridged ed 2002). As relevant here, \u201cpublic service\u201d includes \u201ca service rendered in the public interest\u201d and alternatively \u201cgovernmental employment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>There was evidence in the record that, by virtue of his position as a recruiter for the Oregon National Guard, defendant qualified as a public servant. The record indicates that defendant is an individual who provides a public service both because he assists members of the public, including R, who are seeking to enlist in the Oregon National Guard and because he is undisputedly a government employee. The trial court did not err by denying defendant\u2019s MJOA on Count 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-6\">C. <em>Use of an element of the crime as a sentence aggravating factor</em></p>\n<p id=\"b503-7\">Finally, defendant argues that the court erred in imposing an upward departure sentence based on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>finding that defendant\u2019s offense \u201cinvolved a violation of public trust.\u201d OAR 213-008-0002(l)(b)(F). Defendant argues that, under OAR 213-008-0002(2), a factual circumstance that constitutes an element of an offense can only be used as an aggravating factor if \u201cthe criminal conduct constituting that aspect of the current crime of conviction is significantly different from the usual criminal conduct captured by the aspect of the crime.\u201d The state concedes that \u201cdefendant appears to be correct [,]\u201d and we agree. We conclude, however, that the error was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-4\">OAR 213-008-0002 governs departures from the sentencing guidelines and provides a nonexclusive list of mitigating and aggravating factors, including that \u201c[t]he offense involved a violation of public trust or professional responsibility.\u201d However, OAR 213-008-0002(2) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b504-5\">\u201cIf a factual aspect of a crime is a statutory element of the crime or is used to subclassify the crime on the Crime Seriousness Scale, that aspect of the current crime of conviction may be used as an aggravating or mitigating factor only <em>if the criminal conduct constituting that aspect of the current crime of conviction is significantly different from the usual criminal conduct captured by the aspect of the crime\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b504-6\">(Emphasis added.) Here, Count 3 charged defendant with coercion on the theory that he</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b504-7\">\u201cdid unlawfully and intentionally compel or induce [R] to engage in conduct in which [R] had a legal right to abstain from engaging in, by means of instilling in [R] a fear that if [R] refrained from the conduct or engaged in the conduct contrary to the compulsion or inducement, the said defendant would unlawfully use or abuse the said defendant\u2019s position as a public servant by performing some act within or related to official duties, or by failing or refusing to perform an official duty in such a manner as to affect some person adversely!.]\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b504-8\">Thus, one of the factual aspects of that crime also constitutes a violation of the public trust and of standards of professional responsibility. Therefore, OAR 213-008-0002(2) requires a finding that defendant\u2019s criminal conduct was \u201csignificantly different\u201d from the usual criminal conduct that constitutes coercion through the use or abuse of a person\u2019s position as a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>public servant. As the state rightly concedes, \u201c[t]he jury did not make such a finding here.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b505-4\">Nevertheless, that error was harmless, because it did not affect defendant\u2019s actual period of imprisonment. That is so because the sentence imposed for coercion is wholly concurrent with the sentence imposed for a count from which he does not appeal. <em>See State v. Tremillion, </em>111 Or App 375, 376, 826 P2d 95, <em>rev </em>den, 313 Or 300 (1992) (no remedial action is required when an erroneous sentence is imposed concurrently with a legally permissible sentence and \u201ccannot affect defendant\u2019s actual period of imprisonment\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b505-5\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b505-6\">In sum, we hold that defendant used forcible compulsion in his attempt to sexually abuse R; that he was a \u201cpublic servant\u201d when he coerced R; and that, although the trial court erred in imposing an upward departure sentence on the coercion count, that error was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-7\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b495-7\"> Defendant was charged with 10 counts involving two women. Pour counts were subsequently dismissed. Of the remaining six counts, he challenges his convictions on only two, both of which involve the same victim.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b497-7\"> In two of his assignments of error, defendant argues that the court erred by imposing upward departure sentences without the state having pleaded the enhancement factors in the indictment or submitting them to the grand jury. After this case was briefed and argued, the Supreme Court rejected the identical argument, <em>State v. Reinke, </em>354 Or 98, 309 P3d 1059, <em>adh\u2019d to as modified on recons, </em>354 Or 570, 316 P3d 286 (2013), and we reject it again without discussion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b497-8\"> OES 163.427 provides, in part,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b497-9\">\u201c(1) A person commits the crime of sexual abuse in the first degree when that person:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b497-10\">\u201c(a) Subjects another person to sexual contact and:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b497-11\">\u00ab* :{: * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b497-12\">\u201c(B) The victim is subjected to forcible compulsion by the actor[.]\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b497-13\"> We review the denial of an MJOA to determine whether, after viewing the facts and the inferences that can reasonably be drawn from them in the light most favorable to the state, a rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime proved beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>State v.
