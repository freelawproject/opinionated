J.</author>\n<p id=\"b679-4\">This case stems from a labor dispute between the City of Grants Pass and the union that represents the city\u2019s firefighters, the International Association of Fire Fighters, Local 3564 (IAFF). The dispute centers on how the city should calculate the number of hours a firefighter has accumulated for purposes of qualifying for overtime compensation. The union relies on ORS 652.080, which mandates that, for firefighters, \u201cauthorized vacation or sick leave time shall be considered as time on regular duty[,]\u201d and therefore count toward overtime entitlement. The city argues that the statutory requirement does not apply, because the city and the union bargained over, and agreed to, a different method of calculating overtime \u2014 a method based on actual \u201ctime worked,\u201d <em>not </em>including sick leave and authorized vacation. According to the city, the Public Employees Collective Bargaining Act (PECBA), ORS 243.650 to 243.782, creates a comprehensive structure under which public employee unions can negotiate terms of employment, and it supersedes the mandate of ORS 652.080. The Commissioner of the Bureau of Labor and Industries (BOLI) issued a declaratory ruling in favor of the union, and the city appeals. For the reasons that follow, we agree with the commissioner and the union that ORS 652.080 applies and that the city must include authorized vacation and sick leave time when computing overtime wages for the union-represented firefighters that it employs.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-5\">The relevant facts are not in dispute. The City of Grants Pass operates a \u201cregularly organized fire department\u201d that employs firefighters on a full-time basis. Those firefighters are represented by IAFF. The parties have negotiated a collective bargaining agreement that specifies how overtime is to be calculated. The agreement states that \u201cRegular Shift Employees,\u201d including firefighters, are to be compensated</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b679-6\">\u201cat the rate of 11/2 times their respective <em>56 </em>hour per week regular hourly rate * * * for overtime work under the following conditions:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b679-7\">\u201c1. All time worked as a Firefighter or Fire Corporal in excess of the regularly scheduled work shift for that employee <em>(e.g., </em>in excess of 24 hours in any one workday).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b680-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"660\">*660</page-number><em>\u201c2. </em>All time worked as a Firefighter or Fire Corporal in excess of 204 hours in a 27 calendar day for 24-hour duty schedule fire service non-exempt employees.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b680-4\">\u201c3. Forty-Hour Employees: Overtime for 40-hour employees shall be time worked (1) in excess of 8 hours for a specific job class in a workday for employees working five 8 hour shifts, or (2) in excess of 10 hours for a specific job class in a workday for employees working four 10 hour shifts and (3) in excess of 40 hours in a work week.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b680-5\">\u201c4. Employees assigned to on-call fire prevention shall be paid $100.00 a month in addition to overtime and callback earned.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b680-6\">The agreement does not require the city to include time spent on authorized vacation and sick leave when determining when a firefighter has accumulated enough time to qualify for overtime wages, nor does the agreement <em>expressly </em>prohibit the city from doing so.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-7\">In June 2011, the union petitioned BOLI for a declaratory ruling, ORS 183.410, that the city was required to \u201cinclude vacation and sick leave time when calculating overtime wages for firefighters employed by the City, as set forth in ORS 652.080.\u201d That statute provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b680-8\">\u201cIn computing the average or total number of hours a week for the purposes of ORS 652.060 and 652.070 [relating to overtime hours for firefighters], authorized vacation or sick leave time shall be considered as time on regular duty.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b680-9\">The City of Grants Pass intervened, noting that, after enacting ORS 652.080 in 1959, Or Laws 1959, ch 402, \u00a7 4, the legislature passed PECBA in 1973, Or Laws 1973, ch 536. PECBA, the city notes, permits employees to bargain collectively with their public employers. According to the city, the subsequent passage of PECBA allowed the city and the union to agree to a method of calculating overtime other than the one mandated by ORS 652.080. BOLI concluded, however, that the enactment of PECBA did not create a collective bargaining exception to the overtime requirements of ORS 652.080 and issued a declaratory ruling that the city <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"661\">*661</page-number>was \u201crequired to include authorized vacation and sick leave time when computing overtime wages for the IAFF firefighters it employs [.]\u201d On appeal, the city seeks reversal of that ruling, arguing that \u201ca correct interpretation of [PECBA], compels a determination that the city is not required to include vacation and sick time when calculating overtime wages for firefighters.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b681-4\">We review declaratory rulings for errors of law. <em>Simpson v. Dept. of Fish and Wildlife, </em>242 Or App 287, 290, 255 P3d 565 (2011); ORS 183.482(8)(a). Where, as here, the resolution of a dispute requires us to determine the meaning of a statute, our \u201cparamount goal\u201d is to determine the legislature\u2019s intent. <em>State v. Gaines, </em>346 Or 160, 171, 206 P3d 1042 (2009). We begin by examining the text and context of a statute and any relevant legislative history. <em>Id. </em>at 171-72. To aid us in that examination, we employ \u201crules of construction that bear directly on the interpretation of the statutory provision in context [,]\u201d some of which are statutory \u2014 for example, the rule that counsels us not to omit what is included or insert what is omitted. ORS 174.010; <em>PGE v. Bureau of Labor and Industries, </em>317 Or 606, 611, 859 P2d 1143 (1993). If the legislature\u2019s intent remains unclear, the final step is to resort to \u201cgeneral maxims of statutory construction.\u201d <em>Gaines, </em>346 Or at 172.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-5\">We begin by noting that there is nothing in the plain text of PECBA that would imply that the legislature intended to create a collective bargaining exception to the requirements of ORS 652.080. Typically, when the legislature intends to create such an exception, it does so explicitly. <em>See, e.g., </em>ORS 653.269(5)(b) (providing that public employees may be exempted from the overtime scheme established by ORS 653.268 if covered by a collective bargaining agreement that expressly waives the application of that statute); ORS 652.020(4) (allowing a labor organization to agree to \u201climits on the required hours of work and overtime\u201d that are different from the limits provided for in ORS 652.020(1) and (2)); ORS 653.261(3) (providing that certain rules adopted by BOLI relating to \u201cminimum conditions of employment\u201d do not apply to public employees who are covered by a collective bargaining agreement prescribing rules on those same conditions).</p>\n<p id=\"b682-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"662\">*662</page-number>The city, however, argues that, in enacting PECBA, the legislature created a \u201ccomprehensive regulatory scheme\u201d the purpose of which was to encourage the resolution of labor disputes through negotiation and mediation. To accomplish that purpose, the city insists, Oregon labor laws have consistently elevated \u201cnegotiation over prescription,\u201d and that principle applies \u201ceven where the Legislative Assembly has not made the hierarchy express.\u201d Therefore, the city contends, the subsequent passage of PECBA rendered ORS 652.080 obsolete.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-4\">In support of that novel theory, the city cites the legislative history of a related statute, ORS 652.060. Ten years after the enactment House Bill (HB) 501 (1959), which created ORS 652.080, the legislature passed Senate Bill (SB) 383 (1969), which amended ORS 652.060. Or Laws 1959, ch 402 \u00a7 4; Or Laws 1969, ch 581 \u00a7 1. During a hearing on SB 383, Senator Lent stated that \u201cunits of local government refuse * * * to sit down and listen, bargain or talk about things that involve employees. There is no compulsory bargaining act for public employees in the state and firemen have no right to strike.\u201d Minutes, House Committee on Local Government, SB 383, Apr 23, 1969, 2 (testimony of Sen Berkeley Lent). For obvious reasons, the city\u2019s reliance on those comments is wholly misplaced. Senator Lent\u2019s testimony provides insight into his personal reasons for supporting SB 383 in 1969 and, perhaps, suggests that other members of that committee may have agreed with him. Those comments do not, however, help us determine why a different legislature passed a different bill that created a different statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-5\">Further, the meaning of PECBA must be determined according to the intent of the legislature that enacted it, not the previous legislature that enacted ORS 652.080. <em>State v. Swanson, </em>351 Or 286, 290, 266 P3d 45 (2011). We presume that, when a legislature enacts a statute, it does so \u201cwith full knowledge of the existing condition of the law and with reference to it.\u201d <em>Coates v. Marion County, </em>96 Or 334, 339, 189 P 903 (1920). The city\u2019s argument, then, reduces to the proposition that the PECBA legislature knew that ORS 652.080 dealt specifically with firefighters\u2019 overtime and intended to supersede that statute, but for some <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"663\">*663</page-number>reason neglected to say so. Even more fundamentally, the city urges us to read into PECBA something that is not there \u2014 a repeal of ORS 652.080. Yet the days are long gone, if they ever existed, when this court would insert language into a statute in reliance on an obscure maxim of statutory <em>construction </em>\u2014 \u201ccessant <em>ratione legis, cessat lex\u201d </em>or \u201cwhen the reason for a law ends, the law ends\u201d \u2014 instead of applying statutorily mandated rules of construction, in particular ORS 174.010, which, as noted above, instructs that it is our job to \u201cdeclare what is\u201d and not \u201cto insert what has been omitted, or to omit what has been inserted.\u201d Indeed, if we could rely on a policy-based maxim, it would be the one telling us that implied repeals are disfavored. <em>Messick v. Duty, </em>86 Or 366, 371, 168 P 628 (1917).</p>\n<p id=\"b683-4\">The city relies as well on <em>AFSCME v. Executive Dept., </em>52 Or App 457, 628 P2d 1228, <em>rev den, </em>291 Or 771 (1981). That case involved a dispute between several chapters of the American Federation of State, County, and Municipal Employees (AFSCME) and various state agencies. The AFSCME locals represented public employees who were prohibited from striking by law. <em>Id. </em>at 459. As an alternative to the right to strike, PECBA provides that, when a public employer and a labor organization representing strike-prohibited employees fail to reach a collective bargaining agreement, each party shall submit a \u201clast best offer\u201d to an arbitrator. ORS 243.742; ORS 243.746. That arbitrator has the power to issue a written opinion and order implementing whichever offer the arbitrator finds best meets the criteria listed in ORS 243.746(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b683-5\">That is precisely what happened in <em>AFSCME, </em>resulting in the arbitrator awarding \u201csalary increases and adjustments to specific classes of workers.\u201d 52 Or App at 461. The state, however, refused to implement the award, and AFSCME filed an unfair labor practice claim with the Employment Relations Board. <em>Id. </em>The board issued an order finding that the state agencies had violated ORS 243.672(l)(g), which provides that public employers must abide by the terms of an arbitration award \u201cwhere previously the parties have agreed to accept arbitration awards as final and binding upon them.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 462.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"664\">*664</page-number>Subsequently, both parties filed petitions for judicial review. <em>Id. </em>at 463. The state argued, as relevant here, that the board \u201cerred in affirming the arbitration award without the approval of the plan by the Personnel Division.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 467. The state\u2019s theory was based on statutes that gave the division the \u201cauthority to establish a state classification plan, conduct a continuing salary survey and adopt a compensation plan for all classified and certain unclassified employe [e]s.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b684-4\">Ultimately, we held that the Personnel Division did not have the authority to approve the rates set by the arbitrator. <em>Id. </em>at 471. In reaching that conclusion, we reasoned that PECBA had modified</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b684-5\">\u201cthe authority of the State Personnel Division so that, while it retains responsibility for establishing general job salary grades and classifications, the specific salary within each range which is paid to an employe [e] in a public employe [e] bargaining unit is subject to negotiation or arbitration under the terms of [PECBA]. To conclude otherwise would defeat the purpose of the public employe [e] bargaining statute.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b684-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 470.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-7\">The city argues that our reasoning in <em>AFSCME </em>\u201cleads to the same result here.\u201d We understand the city to mean that, just as PECBA modified the authority of the State Personnel Division, PECBA has modified ORS 652.080, creating an implicit collective bargaining exception. We do not agree, however, that <em>AFSCME </em>leads to that conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-8\">The most obvious problem with the city\u2019s argument is that we did not hold that the enactment of PECBA implicitly amended the civil service statutes themselves. Indeed, we stated unambiguously, \u201cThere is no indication that in enacting [PECBA], the Oregon Legislature meant to repeal or alter existing civil service law.\u201d <em>AFSCME, </em>52 Or App at 470. Rather, our decision was meant to \u201cgive meaning to the provisions of both [PECBA] and the civil service laws and to harmonize seeming conflicts between them[.]\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 468. We gave meaning to the civil service statutes by concluding that the State Personnel Division is responsible for establishing general job classifications and salary ranges. <em>Id. </em>at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"665\">*665</page-number>470. Likewise, we gave meaning to the provisions of PECBA by concluding that the \u201cspecific salary within each range which is paid to an employe [e]\u201d could be determined by the collective bargaining process. <em>Id. </em>In short, the lesson that we derive from <em>AFSCME </em>is not that PECBA silently repeals pre-existing statutes, but that we should resolve conflicts between PECBA and such statutes by harmonizing them.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-4\">We take the same approach here. First, as the union points out, ORS 652.080 and PECBA can be read consistently:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b685-5\">\u201cPECBA creates general collective bargaining rights for public employees. However, PECBA does not provide that parties may bargain to exempt themselves from explicit statutory requirements on specific issues. On the other hand, ORS 652.080 creates a narrow overtime entitlement for public firefighters. This overtime entitlement is distinct and separate from PECBA\u2019s general bargaining provisions and should be read as a discrete statutory directive that collective bargaining agreements for firefighters must follow.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b685-6\">(Citations omitted.) We agree. Like the Supreme Court, we strive to resolve apparent statutory contradictions so as to \u201cgive effect to all.\u201d ORS 174.010. To do so, we will conclude that two provisions are in conflict only when it is not possible to comply with both simultaneously. <em>See State ex rel Haley v. City of Troutdale, </em>281 Or 203, 211, 576 P2d 1238 (1978) (reconciling state and local building codes). Furthermore, even if we were to conclude that there was an irreconcilable conflict between the two statutory schemes, our solution would not be to insert a collective bargaining exception into ORS 652.080. Rather, we would conclude that the more particular statute, which is ORS 652.080, controls. ORS 174.020 (When it is not possible to interpret statutes so as to avoid a conflict, the intent behind a provision that is particular controls the intent behind a statute that is general.).</p>\n<p id=\"b685-7\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
