We conclude that the trial court did not err and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-5\">When reviewing the denial of a motion for judgment of acquittal, we \u201cview the evidence in the light most favorable to the state to determine whether a rational trier <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>of fact, making reasonable inferences, could have found the essential elements of the crime proved beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>State v. Hall, </em>327 Or 568, 570, 966 P2d 208 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b162-4\">Defendant stipulated to the following facts. After a police officer stopped defendant for traffic violations, defendant claimed that he had no driver\u2019s license; defendant misidentified himself as \u201cSergio Molina\u201d and gave the officer a birth date purportedly belonging to that person. The officer ran the provided information through dispatch, but dispatch was unable to locate \u201cSergio Molina.\u201d The officer arrested defendant for failure to carry and present a license and transported defendant to the police department.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-5\">During the booking process, someone prepared a property record and a fingerprint card for \u201cSergio Molina.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The documents bear that name as well as a birth date. The fingerprint card also bears defendant\u2019s fingerprints and a social security number. Defendant signed the name \u201cSergio Molina\u201d on the two written documents.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-6\">Defendant was cited and released, and defendant\u2019s fingerprints were faxed to the Automated Fingerprint Identification System (AFIS) \u2014 a system that obtains, stores, and analyzes fingerprint data. An AFIS employee called the officer and reported defendant\u2019s true identity. When the officer later spoke to defendant in jail, where defendant was lodged on a different matter, defendant told the officer that he did not know anyone named \u201cSergio Molina.\u201d Defendant also told the officer that he had lied about his identity because there was a warrant out for his arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-7\">The state charged defendant with identity theft under ORS 165.800, alleging that defendant, with the intent to deceive, did \u201cutter or convert to defendant\u2019s own use personal identification of\u2018Sergio Molina.\u2019\u201d The case proceeded to a bench trial, and defendant moved for judgment of acquittal. At trial, defendant argued that ORS 165.800 did not apply to his conduct because, when he signed the property record and fingerprint card at the police department, he was merely continuing the crime of giving false information to a police officer. To support that argument, defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>cited <em>State v. Fields, </em>191 Or App 127, 128, 79 P3d 915 (2003), in which this court held in a per curiam opinion that the defendant did not commit the crime of identity theft when he \u201cidentified himself as his friend\u201d to a police officer and \u201cgave the officer his friend\u2019s personal identifying information.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The state argued, on the other hand, that defendant committed identity theft when he signed the name \u201cSergio Molina\u201d on the property record and fingerprint card with the intent to deceive the police and to avoid arrest on an outstanding warrant. The trial court denied defendant\u2019s motion for judgment of acquittal, and defendant was convicted as noted above.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-4\">On appeal, defendant argues that his conduct did not constitute identity theft under ORS 165.800. Although defendant concedes that he may have converted to his own use the signature of another person when he signed the property record and fingerprint card, defendant argues that such conduct did not violate ORS 165.800 because he did not convert to his own use a written document. Defendant also contends that he did not utter the personal identification of another person, but that he merely \u201ccaused\u201d the police officer to utter such personal identification. Citing <em>Fields, </em>defendant further asserts that the legislature did not intend to punish someone who signs the name of another person to a document under circumstances such as those in this case.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b163-5\">The state responds that defendant, with the intent to deceive, converted to his own use, and uttered, the personal identification of \u201cSergio Molina\u201d when he signed the property record and fingerprint card, thereby violating ORS 165.800. The state also contends that <em>Fields </em>is not disposi-tive because it relies entirely on legislative history from the 1999 regular session of the Legislative Assembly. The state notes that, in 2001, the legislature broadened the scope of the identity theft statute to criminalize conduct undertaken <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>\u201cwith the intent to deceive [.]\u201d Or Laws 2001, ch 870, \u00a7 3. In the state\u2019s view, that change demonstrates legislative intent to punish the conduct at issue in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-4\">Whether ORS 165.800 applies to defendant\u2019s conduct is a matter of statutory interpretation. <em>See, e.g., State v. Smith, </em>259 Or App 36, 312 P3d 552 (2013) (reviewing trial court\u2019s denial of the defendant\u2019s motion for judgment of acquittal and analyzing the text of ORS 165.572 to determine whether that statute applied to the defendant\u2019s conduct). When interpreting a statute, our goal is to discern legislative intent. <em>State v. Gaines, </em>346 Or 160, 171, 206 P3d 1042 (2009). We first look to the statutory text and context to determine the plain meaning of the statute. <em>Id. </em>Then, if it is useful to our analysis, we also consider legislative history. <em>Id. </em>at 172.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-5\">As noted, a \u201cperson commits the crime of identity theft if the person *** utters or converts to the person\u2019s own use the personal identification of another person.\u201d ORS 165.800.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Our analysis of the text and context focuses on an examination of the following terms: \u201cconvert,\u201d \u201cutter,\u201d and \u201cpersonal identification.\u201d When a term is defined by a statute, we look to the statutory definition, but when a term is not statutorily defined, we look to dictionary definitions to ascertain the plain meaning of the term. <em>See Gaines, </em>346 Or at 175 (using dictionary definitions to discern the plain, natural, and ordinary meaning of terms). In this case, ORS 165.800 does not define the terms \u201cconvert\u201d or \u201cutter.\u201d Thus, we look to dictionary definitions of those terms in context. <em>See, e.g, State v. Fries, </em>344 Or 541, 545-50, 185 P3d 453 (2008) (using context to determine which of multiple definitions is the one that the legislature intended). The term \u201cconvert\u201d means, in its most relevant sense, \u201cto appropriate dishonestly or illegally [.] \u201d <em>Webster\u2019s Third New Int\u2019l Dictionary </em>499 (unabridged ed 2002). The term \u2018\u201cto utter\u2019 is expressive, whether the word has its technical legal meaning, \u2018[t]o put or send (a document) into circulation,\u2019 or its plain meaning, \u2018[t]o say, express, or publish.\u2019\u201d <em>See State v. Porter, </em>198 Or App 274, 278, 108 P3d 107 (2005) (quoting <em>Black\u2019s Law </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number><em>Dictionary </em>1582 (8th ed 2004) (brackets in <em>Porter)). </em>The statute defines \u201c\u2018[p]ersonal identification\u2019\u201d such that it \u201cincludes, but is not limited to, any written document or electronic data that does, or purports to, provide information\u201d concerning, among other things, a person\u2019s name, signature, or social security number. ORS 165.800(4)(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b165-4\">In light of those definitions, we first consider whether defendant converted to his own use the personal identification of another person. As noted, defendant concedes that he may have converted to his own use a <em>signature, </em>but he argues that he did not violate ORS 165.800 because his conduct did not involve written or electronic documents. But defendant\u2019s conduct did, in fact, involve written documents. Defendant signed the name \u201cSergio Molina\u201d on the property record and fingerprint card. Those written documents were the personal identification of another person. When defendant signed the name \u201cSergio Molina\u201d on those documents and submitted them to the police, he appropriated the documents bearing that name, representing them as his own for the purpose of deceiving the police as to his identity. In that way, defendant converted to his own use the \u201cpersonal identification of another person\u201d within the meaning of ORS 165.800.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-5\">Next, we consider whether defendant uttered the personal identification of another person. As noted, defendant argues that he did not utter the personal identification of another person, but that he merely \u201ccaused\u201d the police officer to utter it. We are unpersuaded by defendant\u2019s argument. As we have explained, the term \u201cutter\u201d means \u201cto put\u201d a document into circulation. After defendant signed the property record and fingerprint card with the name \u201cSergio Molina,\u201d he submitted the documents to the police, causing them to be used in standard police procedures. The record does not precisely indicate how the property record was used, but it does indicate that defendant\u2019s fingerprint card was faxed to AFIS, where it was received and analyzed by an AFIS employee. We reject defendant\u2019s contention that the circulation of the fingerprint card is not attributable to defendant, who signed the document with the name of another person and submitted it the police, but to the police officer who faxed it to AFIS. We conclude that, when defendant submitted the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>fingerprint card to the police officer, representing it to be his own, defendant \u201cput\u201d the fingerprint card into circulation\u2014 that is \u201cuttered\u201d \u2014 the \u201cpersonal identification of another person\u201d within the meaning of ORS 165.800.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-4\">Finally, we reject defendant\u2019s contention that <em>Fields </em>requires us to conclude that ORS 165.800 does not apply to defendant\u2019s conduct. The defendant in <em>Fields </em>was convicted of identity theft because he misidentified himself to a police officer by giving the police officer his friend\u2019s name and personal identifying information.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In that decision, in which we reversed the defendant\u2019s conviction, we accepted the state\u2019s concession, based on legislative history, that \u201cthe legislature expressly decided not to apply\u201d the identity theft statute to the facts presented in <em>Fields. </em>191 Or App at 128. When creating the crime of identity theft, the 1999 Legislative Assembly considered a proposed amendment to section 1 of House Bill (HB) 3057 (1999) that would have prohibited a person from representing to a peace officer that the person was another person. <em>See </em>HB 3057-4. The version of HB 3057 that was adopted by the House Committee on Judiciary did not include that prohibition. <em>See </em>HB 3057 B-Engrossed. The prohibition was deleted because of fiscal concerns and because there were already laws in place that would \u201cdeal with people who lie to police officers.\u201d Tape Recording, House Committee on Ways and Means, Subcommittee on Public Safety and Regulation, HB 3057, June 17, 1999, Tape 159, Side A (statement of Rep Floyd Prozanski). The enrolled version of HB 3057 also did not include that prohibition. <em>See </em>Or Laws 1999, ch 1022, \u00a7 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-5\">But the fact that the 1999 Legislative Assembly did not intend for the identity theft statute to apply to the facts in <em>Fields </em>does not require us to conclude that ORS 165.800 does not apply to the facts in this case. First, the facts in <em>Fields </em>are significantly different from the facts in this case. In <em>Fields, </em>the defendant was stopped by a police officer, and during the course of the traffic stop, the defendant misidentified himself as his friend and gave his friend\u2019s personal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>identifying information. 191 Or App at 128. Here, defendant was stopped by a police officer, and during the course of the traffic stop, defendant misidentified himself as another person and gave the officer a birth date without providing any written documentation. But defendant\u2019s conduct did not end there. Defendant was then arrested and taken to the police department, where, during the booking process, defendant permitted information concerning the personal identification of another person to be included in official police documents. As noted, the property record contained the name and birth date of \u201cSergio Molina,\u201d and the fingerprint card contained the name and birth date of \u201cSergio Molina\u201d as well as the fingerprints and social security number of \u201cSergio Molina.\u201d Defendant then signed that name to both documents and submitted those documents to the police, causing the fingerprint card to be faxed to AFIS. Because defendant signed and submitted official documents providing information concerning the personal identification of another person, defendant\u2019s conduct in this case went well beyond the conduct at issue in <em>Fields </em>\u2014 mere lying to the police. Second, as noted by the state, the Legislative Assembly amended the identity theft statute in 2001 to criminalize conduct undertaken not only with the intent to defraud, but also with the intent to \u201cdeceive^]\u201d Or Laws 2001, ch 870, \u00a7 3. That amendment was intended to clarify that the statute covers conduct that is not motivated by pecuniary or financial gain. Audio Recording, Senate Committee on Judiciary, HB 2918, May 16, 2001, at 1:18:57 (statement of Staff Counsel Craig Prins), http://sos. oregon.gov (accessed Mar 26, 2014) (\u201cdeceive\u201d added to identity theft statute to \u201cmake it clear\u201d that \u201cany deception is enough\u201d to satisfy the intent element of the statute). As a result, it is clear that the identity theft statute targets not only fraud, but also deception. <em>Porter, </em>198 Or App at 279 (\u201cThe harm that the statute targets is deception.\u201d). Nothing in the text of ORS 165.800 or its legislative history suggests that the legislature, when amending the identity theft statute in 2001, intended to limit the statute such that it would not apply when a person engages in the conduct at issue in this case with the intent to deceive the police. Therefore, legislative history from 2001, which was not analyzed in <em>Fields, </em>leads us to conclude that ORS 165.800 is intended to cover <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>the conduct at issue in this case and that <em>Fields </em>should be limited to its facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-4\">Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the state, we conclude that a rational trier of fact, making reasonable inferences, could have found the essential elements of ORS 165.800 proved beyond a reasonable doubt, based on defendant having signed a property record and fingerprint card, each bearing information concerning the personal identification of another person, with the name of another person, and having submitted those documents to the police with the undisputed intent to deceive the police as to his identity to avoid arrest on an outstanding warrant. The trial court did not err when it denied defendant\u2019s motion for judgment of acquittal.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b161-6\"> At the time of defendant\u2019s conduct that led to defendant\u2019s conviction for identity theft, ORS 165.800 provided, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b161-7\">\u201c(1) A person commits the crime of identity theft if the person, with the intent to deceive or to defraud, obtains, possesses, transfers, creates, utters or converts to the person\u2019s own use the personal identification of another person.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b161-8\">\u201c(4) As used in this section:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b161-9\">\u201c(a) \u2018Another person\u2019 means a real person, whether living or deceased, or an imaginary person.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b161-10\">\u201c(b) \u2018Personal identification\u2019 includes, but is not limited to, any written document or electronic data that does, or purports to, provide information concerning:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b161-11\">\u201c(A) A person\u2019s name, address or telephone number;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b161-12\">* * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b161-13\">\u201c(C) A person\u2019s Social Security number or tax identification number;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b161-14\">\u00ab* \u2021 :\u00a1:\u2021</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b161-15\">\u201c(I) A person\u2019s signature or a copy of a person\u2019s signature;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b161-16\">\u00ab* * * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b161-17\">\u201c(L) A person\u2019s date of birthf.]\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b161-18\">ORS 165.800 was amended during the 2013 regular session of the Legislative Assembly. <em>See </em>Or Laws 2013, ch 158, \u00a7 34.
