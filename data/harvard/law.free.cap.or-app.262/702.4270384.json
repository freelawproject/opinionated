Defendant assigns error to the trial court\u2019s (1) denial of her motion for judgment of acquittal (MJOA), (2) failure to instruct the jury on an element of the offense, and (3) exclusion of her testimony regarding the reason for her failure to appear. For the reasons that follow, we conclude that the trial court did not err in denying defendant\u2019s MJOA; however, we conclude that the trial court did err in excluding defendant\u2019s testimony. Accordingly, we reverse and remand. Given that disposition, we need not address defendant\u2019s contention concerning instructional error.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-7\">We begin with a brief overview of the events that led to defendant\u2019s conviction. Defendant\u2019s brother called the police to report that defendant had intentionally damaged his car. Officer Hughes investigated the report and called defendant, who denied damaging the car. Eventually, on November 15, 2010, Hughes met with defendant and issued her a citation for first-degree criminal mischief, ORS 164.365, a Class C felony. The citation directed defendant to appear in court on November 30, 2010, and indicated that her appearance was mandatory. Defendant informed Hughes that she was scheduled to be in the Virgin Islands on the date listed on the citation. Hughes told her that there was nothing he could do about the scheduled date.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-8\">When defendant did not appear in court on November 30, the state charged her with failure to appear on a criminal citation, ORS 133.076.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Before trial on that charge, the state filed a motion <em>in limine </em>to prevent defendant from testifying about why she had failed to appear, arguing that such evidence was not relevant under OEC 401. The trial court granted the state\u2019s motion and excluded defendant\u2019s evidence as irrelevant. After a jury trial, defendant was convicted, and she now appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-9\">We begin with defendant\u2019s challenge to the trial court\u2019s denial of her MJOA. Under ORS 133.076(1), a person</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b725-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"705\">*705</page-number>\u201ccommits the offense of failure to appear on a criminal citation if the person has been served with a criminal citation issued under ORS 133.055 to 133.076 and the person knowingly fails to do any of the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b725-4\">\u201c(a) Make an appearance in the manner required by ORS 133.060.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b725-5\">Thus, the state was required to establish two elements: (1) defendant was served with a criminal citation issued under ORS 133.055 to 133.076 and (2) defendant knowingly failed to make an appearance in the manner required by ORS 133.060.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b725-6\">At the conclusion of the state\u2019s evidence, defendant moved for judgment of acquittal, arguing that the state had failed to establish the first element because of its failure to prove that the citation was \u201cissued under ORS 133.055 to 133.076.\u201d The trial court concluded that, if any determination concerning the authority for the citation defendant received were required, then it would be a matter for the court to decide, not the jury. On appeal, defendant\u2019s first assignment of error turns solely on her legal argument that ORS 133.076 requires the state to prove, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the state issued the citation in compliance with the requirements of ORS 133.055 to 133.076 and that she was entitled to acquittal because it is undisputed that the state failed to do so. Specifically, defendant contends that \u201cthe statute\u2019s text requires the state to prove that the citation was issued under the entire range of statutes from ORS 133.055 to ORS 133.076 \u2014 not just ORS 133.055 and ORS 133.069.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b725-7\">In response, the state argues that defendant misconstrues the meaning of the phrase \u201cissued under ORS 133.055 to 133.076.\u201d The state contends that the legislature did not intend to create additional elements of the offense when it included that phrase in ORS 133.076. Rather, the state contends, the phrase\u2019s plain meaning indicates that the legislature intended it to describe the type of citation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"706\">*706</page-number>that would form the basis for that particular iteration of the crime of failure to appear. We agree with the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-4\">Whether the phrase \u201cissued under ORS 133.055 to 133.076\u201d requires the state to prove, as an element of the offense, that the citation was issued in compliance with the requirements contained in those statutes is a question of statutory construction. In interpreting a statute, our task is to discern the intent of the legislature. <em>PGE v. Bureau of Labor and Industries, </em>317 Or 606, 610, 859 P2d 1143 (1993). We look first at the text and context of the statute, and consider legislative history if it appears useful to our analysis. <em>State v. Gaines, </em>346 Or 160, 171-72, 206 P3d 1042 (2009). The context of the statute \u201cincludes other provisions of the same and related statutes.\u201d <em>State v. Fitzhugh, </em>260 Or App 401, 408, 317 P3d 371 (2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b726-5\">With those principles in mind, we begin, as we must, with the text of ORS 133.076(1). The legislature did not define \u201cissued under,\u201d which defendant identifies as the key portion of the disputed phrase. Because the phrase includes terms of common usage, we give them their plain, natural, and ordinary meaning. <em>See PGE, </em>317 Or at 611. Common definitions of the intransitive verb \u201cissue\u201d include \u201cto proceed or come forth from a usu[ally] specified source,\u201d \u201cto appear or become available through being officially put forth or distributed or granted or proclaimed or promulgated,\u201d and \u201cto go forth by authority.\u201d <em>Webster\u2019s Third New Int\u2019l Dictionary </em>1201 (unabridged ed 2002). Common definitions of the preposition \u201cunder\u201d include \u201crequired by : in accordance with : bound by,\u201d \u201cin conditions or circumstances of,\u201d \u201cattested or warranted by cissued [under] the royal seal&gt;,\u201d and \u201csubject to the bidding or authority of.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2487.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-6\">Combined, the meaning of those terms indicates that the phrase \u201ca criminal citation issued under ORS 133.055 to 133.076\u201d refers to a criminal citation that proceeded from the source of, and as authorized by, ORS 133.055 to 133.076. It follows from our reading of the phrase that, for the first element identified in ORS 133.076, the legislature intended that the state be required to prove only that the person was served with a criminal citation having as its source the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"707\">*707</page-number>statutes listed in ORS 133.055 to 133.076, not that the citation, as issued, complied with those statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-4\">Other textual indicators support that understanding. First, defendant\u2019s argument is not logical in light of the content and structure of the phrase \u201cissued under ORS 133.055 to 133.076.\u201d The statutes referenced in ORS 133.076 generally describe the authority for, content of, and procedure for issuance of criminal citations, and ORS 133.076 states the offense for failure to appear on a criminal citation. Under defendant\u2019s view, the state would have to prove compliance with all of the listed statutes; yet necessarily, for any offense charged, some of the statutes listed in ORS 133.076 will not apply. For instance, ORS 133.068 describes what must be included in a criminal citation that is issued without a complaint, whereas ORS 133.069 describes what must be included in a criminal citation issued with a complaint. Additionally, ORS 133.070 sets forth the conditions in which a criminal citation may be issued for the violation of an ordinance in lieu of an arrest, as opposed to a criminal citation issued for the commission of a misdemeanor or felony under ORS 133.055, as in this case. Moreover, defendant\u2019s reading would require the state to prove to a jury not only that the authority for, content of, and process used to issue the citation were proper but also that the criminal citation was \u201cissued under\u201d ORS 133.076, the criminal offense itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-5\">Second, the import of defendant\u2019s argument is that the state would be required to prove three elements to the factfinder to establish an offense under ORS 133.076. Defendant\u2019s contention ignores the structure of the sentence, which suggests that the state must prove the two elements that are separated by the term \u201cand\u201d: \u201cA person commits the offense of failure to appear on a criminal citation if the person has been served with a criminal citation issued under ORS 133.055 to 133.076 <em>and </em>the person knowingly fails to do any of the following * * * \u201d (Emphasis added.) Defendant\u2019s proposed reading would require the state to prove a third element, namely, that the citation, in addition to being served, was also in compliance with the requirements contained within ORS 133.055 to 133.076. The legislature could <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"708\">*708</page-number>have, but did not, insert an additional \u201cand\u201d between the requirements that \u201cthe person was served with a criminal citation\u201d and that the citation was \u201cissued under ORS 133.055 to 133.076,\u201d nor did the legislature otherwise indicate a series of three elements for the offense. Although there can be subparts to an element, the insertion of defendant\u2019s proposed requirement is not supported by a plain reading of the phrase.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-4\">The context of ORS 133.076 confirms our conclusion. One of the other statutes ORS 133.076 references, ORS 133.069(3), provides that, if the complaint does not conform to the requirements of ORS 133.069, \u201cthe court shall set the complaint aside <em>upon a motion of the defendant </em>made before entry of a plea.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Although this case does not deal with a criminal citation issued with a complaint, ORS 133.069 suggests that, under the statutory scheme contemplated by the legislature, an allegation of noncompliance with the listed statutes is an issue best raised by the defendant in a pretrial motion, rather than tried to the factfinder. <em>See also State v. Rainoldi, </em>351 Or 486, 498, 268 P3d 568 (2011) (stating that, \u201c[o]rdinarily, an element that is purely a question of law is a matter for the court\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b728-5\">Furthermore, defendant\u2019s argument does not account for the fact that there is more than one type of \u201cfailure to appear\u201d offense. <em>See, e.g., </em>ORS 153.992(1) (\u201cA person commits the offense of failure to appear <em>in a violation proceeding </em>if the person has been served with <em>a violation citation </em>issued under this chapter and the person knowingly fails to do any of the following: (a) Make a first appearance in the manner required by ORS 153.061 within the time allowed.\u201d (Emphasis added.)). The need to distinguish types of \u201cfailure to appear\u201d offenses provides further support for our conclusion that the legislature\u2019s inclusion of the phrase \u201ca criminal citation issued under ORS 133.055 to 133.076\u201d was intended to identify the type of citation issued, in accordance with the offense defined in ORS 133.076.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-6\">Defendant does not urge a different construction based on legislative history, and we have found nothing in the legislative history of ORS 133.076 to suggest one. Accordingly, the state was required to prove only that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"709\">*709</page-number>defendant was served with a criminal citation having as its source the statutes listed in ORS 133.055 to 133.076.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-4\">With that understanding of ORS 133.076, we readily conclude that the evidence at trial was sufficient to support the first element. The state proved that defendant was served with a criminal citation for first-degree criminal mischief. And, under ORS 133.055,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> one of the statutes enumerated in ORS 133.076, a peace officer has authority to issue a criminal citation to a person if the officer has probable cause to believe that the person has committed any felony that is subject to misdemeanor treatment under ORS 161.705,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> which includes Class C felonies like first-degree criminal mischief. ORS 161.705(l)(a). Because satisfaction of the first element in ORS 133.076 only requires the state to prove, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the defendant was served with a criminal citation that proceeded from the source of, and as authorized by, ORS 133.055 to 133.076, a rational factfinder could have found that the state met its burden in this case. Accordingly, the trial court did not err in denying defendant\u2019s MJOA.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-5\">We turn to defendant\u2019s third assignment of error, in which she argues that the trial court erroneously excluded her testimony regarding the reason she failed to appear on the basis that it was irrelevant under OEC 401. Defendant intended to explain to the jury her mistaken belief that she was not required to appear at the time and place stated in the criminal citation that she received because she thought that the district attorney would not bring charges against her.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-6\">The state filed a motion <em>in limine </em>and sought to exclude <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"710\">*710</page-number>The state argued that the testimony was irrelevant under OEC 401 and merely served defendant\u2019s attempt to place mitigating information before the jury and to garner its sympathy. In particular, the state argued that \u201cwhy [defendant] did not appear in this case [was] not at issue\u201d and, instead, \u201conly that she did not appear\u201d was.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b729-8\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"709\">*709</page-number>\u201ctestimony from the defense that the defendant made efforts to move her arraignment date, why she attempted to move her arraignment date, and to explain where she was at the time she was scheduled to be arraigned.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b730-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"710\">*710</page-number>In response, defendant argued that the testimony was relevant to address whether she \u201cknowingly\u201d failed to appear. Defense counsel explained that defendant intended to testify at trial that, after she received the citation, she visited the district attorney\u2019s office and the police station, heard nothing more about charges being filed, assumed that the district attorney\u2019s office was not charging her, and concluded that she need not appear on November 30. In an offer of proof at the motion hearing, defendant confirmed her counsel\u2019s description of the events:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b730-5\">\u201cWhen I went \u2014 my purpose to go to the DA was to find out what I could do, you know \u2014 whatever\u2014you know, what the responsible thing was to do. [The DA\u2019s office] told me that they would have to see the police report before they would even decide if there was going to be any charges made.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b730-6\">\u201cSo I went back to the police station and asked for the police report to be sent over to the DA\u2019s office. And at that point, I didn\u2019t know that there were going to be any charges actually made.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b730-7\">\u201c* * * I didn\u2019t realize that there was actually \u2014 I thought that the DA was going to look at it and, you know, to my ignorance, I thought they would see that, you know, it was him versus me and that there weren\u2019t going to be any charges. So I felt that it was okay to leave.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b730-8\">* * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b730-9\">\u201c* * * I watched [the employee at the police station] write a note explaining the situation and asking [Hughes] to get the police report over to the DA\u2019s so that [the DA\u2019s office] could \u2014 in their exact words, decide whether charges were going to be brought.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b730-10\">\n<em>%</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b730-11\">\u201cI thought that \u2014 at that point, I thought that no charges were going to be brought. I didn\u2019t realize a citation was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"711\">*711</page-number>for an arraignment. Like I said, I\u2019ve never dealt with this before. I\u2019ve never had to \u2014 you know, been in this situation. So because of my knowledge of what happened and knowing that I didn\u2019t do anything and that it was just, you know, one person\u2019s word against another, I just \u2014 like I said, my ignorance told me that I would, you know \u2014 that the D\u00c1 would look at it and not press charges and that would make the citation null and void.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b731-4\">The trial court granted the state\u2019s motion to exclude the evidence. In reviewing a court\u2019s determination of relevance, we review for legal errors. <em>State v. Titus, </em>328 Or 475, 481, 982 P2d 1133 (1999). A trial court has no discretion under OEC 401 to exclude evidence that is logically relevant. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b731-5\">On appeal, the parties basically reprise their arguments at trial. Specifically, defendant argues that her explanation would have increased the probability of the jury finding that she did not know that she was obligated to appear and thus tended to negate an element of the offense. The state argues that defendant\u2019s mistaken belief is not probative of whether she \u201cknowingly\u201d acted. Its argument rests on the assumption that proof of a person\u2019s knowing failure to appear requires only a showing that the person failed to appear with knowledge of the citation\u2019s contents, that is, a statement that an appearance is required at a certain date, time, and location. <em>See State v. Carter, </em>238 Or App 417, 422, 241 P3d 1205 (2010), <em>rev den, </em>350 Or 130 (2011) (holding that a reasonable factfinder could have inferred, based on the citation and the complaint, that the defendant knew that she was charged with reckless driving and was required to be in court, even if she was not aware of all of the consequences that might flow from a failure to appear).</p>\n<p id=\"b731-6\">Thus, the parties disagree over whether a defendant who receives a criminal citation can offer proof of later occurrences and a misunderstanding as to the requirement to appear, despite the written command in the citation to appear in court at a particular date and time. We agree with defendant that evidence of her belief that she was not required to appear, despite the command of the citation, was logically relevant.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"712\">*712</page-number>Evidence is relevant if it has \u201cany tendency to make the existence of any fact that is of consequence to the determination of the action more probable or less probable than it would be without the evidence.\u201d OEC 401. As explained above, a person commits the offense of failure to appear on a criminal citation if, among other things, the person knowingly fails to appear. ORS 133.076. A person acts knowingly if the person \u201cacts with an awareness that the conduct of the person is of a nature so described or that a circumstance so described exists.\u201d ORS 161.085(8). The knowingly mental state \u201crefers to awareness of conduct and not awareness of the result of particular conduct.\u201d <em>Carter, </em>238 Or App at 422 (internal quotation marks and emphasis omitted). \u201cThus, to prove that defendant knowingly failed to appear, the state had the burden to prove that she <em>knew of her obligation </em>to appear on that date.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 421-22 (emphasis added); <em>see also State v. Rogers, </em>185 Or App 141, 144, 59 P3d 524 (2002) (\u201c[T]he state was required to prove that defendant knew that she was obligated to appear on that date.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b732-4\">In light of what the state was required to prove\u2014 defendant\u2019s knowledge of her obligation \u2014 defendant\u2019s proffered testimony met the low threshold for relevance under OEC 401 because it tended to negate her knowledge that she was obligated to appear on November 30. Our decision in <em>State v. Ross, </em>123 Or App 264, 859 P2d 569 (1993), supports our conclusion and defendant\u2019s view that, despite her knowledge of the appearance date in the criminal citation, defendant\u2019s belief that she need not appear at the time commanded bears on whether she \u201cknowingly\u201d failed to appear.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-5\">In <em>Ross, </em>the defendant was arrested and charged with unauthorized use of a vehicle (UUV) under ORS 164.135; his mother was the victim. 123 Or App at 266. Although the defendant signed a conditional release agreement in which he agreed to appear in court, he did not appear on the date required. <em>Id. </em>To support his defense, he sought to introduce his mother\u2019s statement that she was dropping the charges and a letter written by his mother requesting dismissal of the UUV charge. <em>Id. </em>The trial court granted the state\u2019s motion <em>in limine </em>to exclude that evidence as irrelevant. <em>Id. </em>The defendant appealed, arguing that, because he was charged with \u201cintentionally\u201d failing to appear, he was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"713\">*713</page-number>entitled to present evidence of his state of mind, namely, his mistaken belief that he was not required to appear because the charges had been dropped. <em>Id. </em>The state argued that the evidence was not relevant, because the only intent required under the failure-to-appear statute under which he was charged, ORS 162.205, was the intent to engage in particular conduct, <em>i.e., </em>the \u201cfailure to appear as required.\u201d <em>Ross, </em>123 Or App at 266. We rejected the state\u2019s assertion that, if a defendant has a \u201cconscious objective\u201d not to appear, the defendant\u2019s reason for not appearing is irrelevant. <em>Id. </em>We concluded that the legislature\u2019s \u201cwillingness to exclude negligent failure to appear from culpable conduct\u201d indicated its \u201cwillingness to also allow other similar exclusions,\u201d such as mistake. <em>Id. </em>at 268. We held that evidence of the defendant\u2019s mistaken belief as to the necessity of his appearance was relevant and that the trial court erred in excluding it. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b733-4\">The same reasoning applies here. Defendant admitted that she did not appear on November 30 but sought to introduce evidence that she believed, although mistakenly, that the district attorney would not bring charges and that she did not have to appear. Similar to the evidence in <em>Ross, </em>defendant\u2019s evidence of her alleged mistake concerning the necessity of her appearance was relevant and admissible.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Accordingly, we conclude that the trial court erred when it excluded defendant\u2019s proffered evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-5\">Although the trial court erred in excluding the evidence, we must decide whether that error requires reversal. An evidentiary error is reversible only if it is prejudicial. <em>State v. Dimmick, </em>248 Or App 167, 176, 273 P3d 212 (2012); <em>see also </em>OEC 103(1) (\u201cEvidential error is not presumed to be prejudicial. Error may not be predicated upon a ruling which admits or excludes evidence unless a substantial right of the party is affected[.]\u201d). We will therefore affirm a conviction despite evidentiary error if we can say that there is \u201clittle likelihood that the particular error affected the verdict.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"714\">*714</page-number><em>Dimmick, </em>248 Or App at 176 (internal quotation marks and brackets omitted). We cannot say so in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-4\">As noted, the case was tried to a jury. The excluded evidence spoke directly to whether defendant possessed the required mental state of \u201cknowingly\u201d failing to appear, and it supported her sole theory of defense to the charge. Thus, we conclude that the trial court\u2019s exclusion of the evidence was not harmless, <em>see State v. Davis, </em>336 Or 19, 33-34, 77 P3d 1111 (2003) (concluding that evidentiary error was prejudicial, in part because the excluded evidence went \u201cdirectly to the heart of defendant\u2019s factual theory of the case\u201d), and, therefore, we reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-5\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b724-10\"> Defendant\u2019s cases were later consolidated and she was ultimately acquitted of the first-degree criminal mischief charge.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b725-8\"> ORS 133.060(1) provides, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b725-9\">\u201cA person who has been served with a criminal citation shall appear before a magistrate of the county in which the person was cited at the time, date and court specified in the citation * *</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b729-9\"> ORS 133.055 was amended twice in 2011. <em>See </em>Or Laws 2011, ch 595, \u00a7 53b; Or Laws 2011, ch 666, \u00a7 3. Those amendments are not pertinent to our analysis.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b729-10\"> ORS 161.705 was amended in 2013. <em>See </em>Or Laws 2013, ch 591, \u00a7 5. That amendment is not pertinent to our analysis.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b733-6\"> In addition to arguing that the testimony was irrelevant, the state asserts for the first time in a one-sentence statement that defendant\u2019s mistaken belief is a mistake of law that should have no bearing on the case. We decline to address that assertion. <em>See Cunningham v. Thompson, </em>188 Or App 289, 297 n 2, 71 P3d 110 (2003), <em>rev den, </em>337 Or 327 (2004) (\u201cOrdinarily, the appellate courts of this state will decline to address an undeveloped argument.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
