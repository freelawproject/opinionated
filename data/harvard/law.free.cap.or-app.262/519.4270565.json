J.</author>\n<p id=\"b541-4\">Plaintiffs brought claims for negligence, trespass, timber trespass, ultrahazardous activity, and private nuisance against defendant, their neighbor, alleging that actions defendant took on his property triggered landslides that destroyed plaintiffs\u2019 home. Plaintiffs appeal from a jury verdict and general judgment in favor of defendant. On appeal, plaintiffs pursue two assignments of error with regard to their negligence claim: the trial court erred by (1) admitting evidence that the builder of plaintiffs\u2019 home was negligent and failed to build the house to standards required by building codes and (2) giving a jury instruction on the natural flow of surface water. We conclude that the trial court did not reversibly err, and we affirm. Given our disposition, we need not, and do not, address plaintiffs\u2019 third assignment of error regarding their attempt to seek punitive damages and defendant\u2019s four cross-assignments of error.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b541-5\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b541-6\">Plaintiffs owned a home located east of and across a road downslope from defendant\u2019s house and property. The east side of defendant\u2019s property is steeply sloped and abuts a road, Greenbluff Drive. Across Greenbluff Drive from defendant\u2019s property is another steeply sloped section of property owned by the Marylhurst Place Homeowner\u2019s Association (HOA). The HOA\u2019s property abutted the backyard of plaintiffs\u2019 house, which was cut into the hill and had retaining walls.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-7\">In January 2009, during a storm, two landslides occurred affecting the parties\u2019 properties. One landslide originated on defendant\u2019s property, blocking Greenbluff Drive and a storm-water ditch that ran along the road. The second landslide originated on the HOA\u2019s property and damaged plaintiffs\u2019 house beyond repair.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>The parties had competing theories and expert opinions on which landslide occurred first and the cause of each landslide. Generally, plaintiffs\u2019 theory was that, despite knowledge that his property was prone to slides, defendant removed trees and vegetation from his property and directed storm water to the sloped area of his property, causing the landslide that blocked Greenbluff Drive, which, in turn, forced storm water over Greenbluff Drive and onto the HOA\u2019s property, triggering the second landslide that destroyed plaintiffs\u2019 home.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-4\">Defendant countered with his own theories concerning why he had not acted improperly and had not caused plaintiffs\u2019 damages. The defense theories included that (D the landslides occurred solely due to an extreme, unprecedented storm event, (2) the landslide on the HOA property occurred first, (3) the City of Lake Oswego failed to maintain and clear a storm-drain culvert that, if clear, would have directed the storm water safely away from the landslide blockage on Greenbluff Drive, (4) the builder of plaintiffs\u2019 home \u2014 Cypress Properties, Ltd. (Cypress) \u2014 did not build plaintiffs\u2019 house in accordance with building codes for slope setback and retaining walls, and if it had, plaintiffs\u2019 home would not have been damaged, (5) plaintiffs knew that they should have had the slope and retaining walls inspected by a geotechnical engineer before they bought the home, but chose not to, and (6) defendant\u2019s actions on his property were not negligent and could not have caused the landslide because the tree and vegetation removal occurred in a different area and the storm water had been directed to the same area since 1956 and caused only a negligible increase in water flow.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-5\">Based on those theories, among others, defendant brought a third-party complaint for indemnity and contribution against The Piculell Group, Inc., the developer of plaintiffs\u2019 neighborhood; Cypress; the HOA; and the City of Lake Oswego. All of the third-party defendants were dismissed before trial, either through summary judgment or by voluntary dismissal. With respect to the dismissal of Cypress, the trial court concluded that \u201cthere is no common duty mutually owed by [defendant] and Cypress to support [defendant\u2019s claim for indemnity and contribution. Furthermore, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>[defendant\u2019s obligations to plaintiff[s] were both active and primary.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b543-4\">Plaintiffs\u2019 claims went to trial, and the jury returned a verdict for defendant. On appeal, plaintiffs bring two assignments of error, which are related only to their negligence claim. First, plaintiffs assert that the trial court erred in admitting defendant\u2019s evidence of Cypress\u2019s conduct in building plaintiffs\u2019 home. Second, plaintiffs assert that the trial court erred in giving a jury instruction on the natural-flow-of-water rule because the rule had no application to the facts of this case. The procedural facts related to each of those assignments are discussed in turn below.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-5\">EVIDENCE OF CYPRESS\u2019S CONDUCT</p>\n<p id=\"b543-6\">Based on the dismissals of defendant\u2019s claims against the third-party defendants before trial, plaintiffs brought motions <em>in limine </em>to exclude any evidence of the conduct of those third parties, arguing that they had been determined not to be at fault for plaintiffs\u2019 injury, and that any probative value of the evidence was outweighed by unfair prejudice and would mislead the jury. The trial court denied those motions, explaining that the evidence \u201cwould likely be relevant and essential to defenses based on causation, which require a finding of fact that could not have been made by a judge on Summary Judgment.\u201d Accordingly, the trial court concluded that \u201c[djefendant may offer evidence that a third party has sole and exclusive fault, and may do so in the alternative with evidence that regards more than one third party who may be found to have sole and exclusive fault.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b543-7\">At trial, defendant put on evidence that the third parties were at fault for plaintiffs\u2019 injury. As relevant to plaintiffs\u2019 appeal, defendant presented evidence that Cypress had built plaintiffs\u2019 house in violation of building codes for slope setback and retaining walls and that, if Cypress had met the code requirements, then plaintiffs\u2019 house would not have been damaged. Based on that evidence, defendant argued to the jury that plaintiffs\u2019 house was \u201can accident waiting to happen, and it happened.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b543-8\">On appeal, plaintiffs again argue that defendant\u2019s evidence about Cypress\u2019s conduct was irrelevant and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>unfairly prejudicial. Because the court had determined, in dismissing defendant\u2019s claims against Cypress on summary judgment, that \u201c [defendant]\u2019s obligations to plaintiff[s] were both active and primary,\u201d plaintiffs reason that Cypress\u2019s conduct could not have been the sole and exclusive cause of plaintiffs\u2019 injuries. In addition, plaintiffs argue that Cypress\u2019s conduct could not have affected whether defendant\u2019s negligence was a substantial factor in bringing about plaintiffs\u2019 injury. Because one of those two findings would be necessary to excuse defendant from liability based on evidence of Cypress\u2019s fault, plaintiffs argue that the evidence was irrelevant and misleading to the jury. Defendant disputes plaintiffs\u2019 assertions and also argues that we cannot reach the merits of plaintiffs\u2019 assignment because, even if the trial court erred, it was harmless error.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-4\">The legislature has directed, \u201cNo judgment shall be reversed or modified except for error substantially affecting the rights of a party.\u201d ORS 19.415(2). Thus, we will reverse a trial court\u2019s decision only if the purported error substantially affected the aggrieved party\u2019s rights. \u201c[E]videntiary errors substantially affect a party\u2019s rights and require reversal when the error has some likelihood of affecting the jury\u2019s verdict.\u201d <em>Dew v. Bay Area Health District, </em>248 Or App 244, 258, 278 P3d 20 (2012). Based on the jury instructions, the verdict form, and defendant\u2019s presentation to the jury, we conclude that any error was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-5\">As part of the jury instructions on plaintiffs\u2019 negligence claim, the trial court explained that plaintiffs had to prove a negligent act or omission by defendant and defendant\u2019s causation of damages:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b544-6\">\u201cTo prevail on their claim for negligence, the [plaintiffs] must prove it is more likely than not that these two elements are true:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b544-7\">\u201c(1) [Defendant] was negligent in at least one of the following ways:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b544-8\">\u201ca) Directing his storm water runoff to discharge from the slope on his property directly above the [plaintiffs\u2019] property, and failing to redirect that storm water runoff after the December 2007 landslide;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b545-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>\u201cb) Girdling trees with intent to kill them in 2003, and continuing thereafter to clear, remove, top, and prune trees and other vegetation on his property, especially in the area directly above the [plaintiffs\u2019] property;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b545-4\">\u201cc) Failing to stabilize his slope after the December 2007 landslide;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b545-5\">\u201cd) Directing the removal of additional trees and vegetation from his property in September 2008;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b545-6\">\u201ce) Disregarding the unstable soil conditions, the recommendations of the City of Lake Oswego\u2019s geotechnical firm, and the property rights of downhill property owners like the [plaintiffs]; and/or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b545-7\">\u201cf) Taking no action to eliminate or minimize damage to his neighbors that could be caused by the movement of water, soil, or debris from his property.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b545-8\">\u201c(2) [Defendant\u2019s negligence caused damages to the [plaintiffs].\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b545-9\">Additionally, the court gave several instructions to the jury on the element of causation. One of those concerned the limited circumstance in which a nonparty\u2019s conduct could relieve defendant of liability:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b545-10\">\u201cIf you find the negligence of [defendant] combined with the conduct of nonparties to cause injury to the [plaintiffs] , then [defendant] would be liable for the entire injury, regardless of the relative degree to which it contributed to it. However, if you find the conduct of a single nonparty was the only and exclusive cause of an injury to the plaintiffs, [defendant] is not liable for the injury.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b545-11\">\u201cThe term <em>nonparty </em>means a person or entity other than [defendant] or [plaintiffs].\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b545-12\">(Emphasis in original.)</p>\n<p id=\"b545-13\">The trial court gave the jury a special verdict form that tracked the jury instruction on negligence liability by separately asking whether defendant was negligent and then whether there was causation. The jury answered no to the question, \u201cWas [defendant] negligent in at least one of the ways the [plaintiffs] claim?\u201d Because the jury answered no to that question, as instructed, the jury left unanswered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>the next question: \u201cDid [defendant\u2019s negligence cause damages to the [plaintiffs]?\u201d Thus, the verdict form demonstrates that the jury did not reach the issue of causation on plaintiffs\u2019 negligence claim and that its verdict was simply that defendant was not negligent in any of the ways alleged by plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-4\">The proper focus of our harmless-error analysis, therefore, is on whether any trial court error in allowing defendant to present evidence and argument that Cypress\u2019s conduct caused plaintiffs\u2019 injury had some likelihood of affecting the jury\u2019s verdict that defendant was not negligent in any of the ways alleged by plaintiffs. We conclude that plaintiffs cannot establish that required prejudicial effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-5\">The ways in which defendant was allegedly negligent involved his actions or omissions on his own property\u2014 that is, directing storm water, removing vegetation, and failing to stabilize his slope. The court instructed the jury that Cypress\u2019s conduct in building plaintiffs\u2019 house was relevant only to the jury\u2019s consideration of causation of damages, and, more specifically, the jury\u2019s consideration of whether Cypress\u2019s conduct was such that it could relieve defendant of liability (that is, was it the \u201csole and exclusive\u201d cause of plaintiffs\u2019 injury). Defendant made no argument to the jury that Cypress\u2019s conduct excused his own conduct; rather, as noted earlier, defendant\u2019s theory in regard to Cypress was that the landslide from the HOA property severely damaged plaintiffs\u2019 house because their house was not built in accordance with building codes. We generally presume that a jury follows the jury instructions when rendering its verdict. <em>See State v. Smith, </em>310 Or 1, 26, 791 P2d 836 (1990) (stating that jurors are presumed to follow instructions \u201cabsent an overwhelming probability that they would be unable to do so\u201d); <em>Tenbusch v. Linn County, </em>172 Or App 172, 178, 18 P3d 419, <em>rev den, </em>332 Or 305 (2001) (\u201cIt is presumed that juries follow instructions, not disregard them.\u201d); Thus, we presume that the jury did not consider the evidence of Cypress\u2019s conduct, which pertained to causation, in rendering its verdict for defendant on his alleged breach of the duty of care. Because the admitted evidence did not have \u201csome likelihood of affecting the jury\u2019s verdict,\u201d we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>JURY INSTRUCTION ON THE \u201cNATURAL FLOW\u201d RULE</p>\n<p id=\"b547-4\">In their second assignment of error, plaintiffs assert that the trial court erred by giving the following jury instruction on the right of one landowner to drain surface water onto the land of another:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b547-5\">\u201cUnder the law, the landowner at a relatively higher elevation has the right to allow diffused naturally occurring surface water to pass through natural channels of drainage onto a lower tract of land.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b547-6\">\u201cGenerally, a landowner may only drain onto adjacent land the same amount of surface water that would naturally flow there. The landowner may reasonably accelerate the flow by artificial means, but must give prudent regard to avoid unreasonable inconvenience to the lower landowner.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b547-7\">\u201cSurface water flows \u2018naturally\u2019 when there is no human change of the flow\u2019s direction.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b547-8\">The parties refer to the legal concept in the instruction as the \u201cnatural flow\u201d rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-9\">Plaintiffs do not dispute that the instruction correctly sets out the natural-flow rule, as described in <em>Garbarino v. Van Cleave et al, </em>214 Or 554, 556-57, 330 P2d 28 (1958). Rather, plaintiffs assert that the trial court erred when it gave that instruction, because the legal concept had no application to the facts of the case and, as a result, was likely to have misled the jury by suggesting that defendant was \u201clegally immune\u201d for directing storm water to the steep slope on his property. <em>See Walsh v. Spalding &amp; </em>Son, <em>Inc., </em>216 Or App 55, 67, 171 P3d 1032 (2007), <em>rev den, </em>344 Or 391 (2008) (\u201cAn instruction can be error even if it correctly describes the law if the instruction distracts the jury from the appropriate line of analysis.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.)). Specifically, plaintiffs argue that the rule has no application because (1) they alleged that defendant was negligent in directing storm water onto his own property, not onto the property of others, (2) plaintiffs and defendant are not adjacent landowners, and (3) they did not allege that the storm water on defendant\u2019s property was flowing where it would \u201cnaturally.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b548-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>Plaintiffs\u2019 first and third contentions concern whether their negligence claim implicated the natural-flow rule. We reject those contentions because the negligence claim concerned, in part, whether defendant had acted negligently with regard to the surface water flowing downhill from his property, and the jury was asked to determine whether defendant acted negligently by</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b548-4\">\u201c[d] irecting his storm water runoff to discharge from the slope on his property directly above [plaintiffs\u2019] property, and failing to redirect that storm water runoff after the December 2007 landslide;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b548-5\">\u201c* * * and/or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b548-6\">\u201cMaking no action to eliminate or minimize damage to his neighbors that could be caused by the movement of water, soil, or debris from his property.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b548-7\">Both of those specifications of negligence are directed at defendant discharging storm water from his property and onto the property of another so as to cause damage to plaintiffs: \u201cdischarge <em>from the slope </em>on his property\u201d and \u201cthe movement of water * * * <em>from his </em>property.\u201d Thus, plaintiffs directly put at issue whether defendant could be held liable for damage to downslope property caused by defendant draining surface water from his property.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-8\">The natural-flow rule \u2014 and the jury instruction describing it \u2014 concerns the circumstances under which a landowner like defendant cannot be held liable for damages caused by draining surface water from his or her land. Defendant presented evidence that supported the trial court\u2019s giving of the instruction, namely, that he allowed the water on his property to drain following the natural flow and that he did not redirect or unreasonably accelerate the drainage. Given the specifications of negligence at issue and the evidence, defendant was entitled to a jury instruction that supported his defense. <em>See Chan v. Fred Meyer, </em>71 Or App 20, 23, 691 P2d 150 (1984) (holding that a party is entitled to instructions on its theory of the case, if the evidence supported giving the instruction).</p>\n<p id=\"b548-9\">Plaintiffs\u2019 second contention is that the natural-flow rule was inapplicable because their property did not adjoin <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>defendant\u2019s property. Plaintiffs do not provide us with any explanation of the asserted significance of that fact or any authority that the natural-flow rule cannot apply to the circumstances of this case, in which defendant allegedly negligently directed surface water from his property that contributed to or triggered the mudslide that destroyed plaintiffs\u2019 house downhill and across the street. Although it appears that plaintiffs\u2019 argument lacks support, <em>see Rehfuss v. Weeks, </em>93 Or 25, 26, 32, 182 P 137 (1919) (adopting and applying the natural-flow rule where the plaintiffs and the defendant\u2019s land were not directly adjoining), because plaintiffs\u2019 argument is undeveloped, we decline to address it. <em>See Cunningham v. Thompson, </em>188 Or App 289, 297 n 2, 71 P3d 110 (2003), <em>rev den, </em>337 Or 327 (2004) (\u201cOrdinarily, the appellate courts of this state will decline to address an undeveloped argument.\u201d). Accordingly, we conclude that the trial court did not err in giving an instruction on the natural-flow rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-4\">In A146490, affirmed. In A146505, dismissed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b541-8\"> This opinion reaches only the issues presented by plaintiffs\u2019 appeal in A146490. In the consolidated appeal, A146505, defendant challenged the trial court\u2019s grant of summary judgment to Cypress Properties, Ltd. After consolidation of the appeals and during briefing, defendant moved to voluntarily dismiss his appeal as to Cypress only, which we granted. Because, after Cypress\u2019s dismissal, there are no remaining issues for us to resolve in A146505, we dismiss it as moot.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
