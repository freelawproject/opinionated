J.</author>\n<p id=\"b619-4\">In this workers\u2019 compensation case, claimant, now deceased, sought benefits for a work-related injury. SAIF, the employer\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation insurance carrier, accepted a claim for a lumbar strain. Claimant subsequently sought acceptance of a combined condition, which SAIF accepted but then denied on the ground that the accepted injury was no longer the major contributing cause of the combined condition. The Workers\u2019 Compensation Board upheld SAIF\u2019s denial, and claimant sought judicial review.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b619-5\">SAIF has notified us that, while the petition for judicial review was under advisement, claimant died of causes unrelated to his claim, without a surviving spouse or other statutory beneficiaries. <em>See </em>ORS 656.204. SAIF asserts that the petition should therefore be dismissed, because there is no one entitled to pursue it. Claimant\u2019s personal representative, on behalf of claimant\u2019s estate, opposes the motion to dismiss and seeks to be substituted as claimant and to pursue the petition. SAIF opposes the personal representative\u2019s request to be substituted, contending that an estate is not a \u201cperson\u201d entitled to pursue a claim under ORS 656.218(3). We agree with SAIF and dismiss the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-6\">Several provisions of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Law pertain to the payment of benefits after the death of a worker. When the worker\u2019s death results from an accidental injury, ORS 656.204 describes the types of benefits payable, and to whom:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b619-7\">\u201cIf death results from the accidental injury, payments shall be made as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b619-8\">\u201c(l)(a) The cost of final disposition of the body and funeral expenses, * * * shall be paid, not to exceed 20 times the average weekly wage in any case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b620-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>\u201c(b) The insurer or self-insured employer shall pay bills submitted for disposition and funeral expenses up to the benefit limit established in paragraph (a) of this subsection. If any part of the benefit remains unpaid 60 days after claim acceptance, the insurer or self-insured employer shall pay the unpaid amount to the estate of the worker.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b620-4\">\u201c(2) (a) If the worker is survived by a spouse, monthly benefits shall be paid in an amount equal to 4.35 times 66-2/3 percent of the average weekly wage to the surviving spouse until remarriage. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b620-5\">\u201c(b) If the worker is survived by a spouse, monthly benefits also shall be paid in an amount equal to 4.35 times 10 percent of the average weekly wage for each child of the deceased who is substantially dependent on the spouse for support, until such child becomes 18 years of age.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b620-6\">\u201c(c) If the worker is survived by a spouse, monthly benefits also shall be paid in an amount equal to 4.35 times 25 percent of the average weekly wage for each child of the deceased who is not substantially dependent on the spouse for support, until such child becomes 18 years of age.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b620-7\">\u201c(d) If a surviving spouse receiving monthly payments dies, leaving a child who is entitled to compensation on account of the death of the worker, a monthly benefit equal to 4.35 times 25 percent of the average weekly wage shall be paid to each such child until the child becomes 18 years of age or the child\u2019s entitlement to benefits under subsection (8) of this section ceases, whichever is later.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b620-8\">\u2021 * \u2021 *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b620-9\">\u201c(5)(a) If the worker leaves a dependent other than a surviving spouse or a child, a monthly payment shall be made to each dependent equal to 50 percent of the average monthly support actually received by such dependent from the worker during the 12 months next preceding the occurrence of the accidental injury. If a dependent is under the age of 18 years at the time of the accidental injury, the payment to the dependent shall cease when such dependent becomes 18 years of age. The payment to any dependent shall cease under the same circumstances that would have terminated the dependency had the injury not happened.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b620-10\">Thus, under ORS 656.204(2) to (9), when a worker dies as a result of an accidental injury, the worker\u2019s statutory beneficiaries \u2014 the surviving spouse, minor children, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>other qualifying dependents \u2014 are entitled to monthly benefits as calculated under the statute. The insurer is also required to pay bills for \u201c[t]he cost of final disposition of the body and funeral expenses,\u201d ORS 656.204(l)(a), until 60 days after claim acceptance, when any remaining funeral benefits become payable to the estate. ORS 656.204(l)(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b621-4\">If an injured worker dies during a period of permanent total disability, ORS 656.208 provides that, whatever the cause of death, the insurer shall continue to pay benefits in the same manner and amounts to the worker\u2019s spouse and dependents as provided in ORS 656.204.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-5\">Finally, ORS 656.218 relates to the pursuit of claims and the receipt of benefits for permanent partial disability after the death of a worker as a result of causes unrelated to the accidental injury:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b621-6\">\u201c(1) In case of the death of a worker entitled to compensation, whether eligibility therefor or the amount thereof have been determined, payments shall be made for the period during which the worker, if surviving, would have been entitled thereto.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b621-7\">\u201c(2) If the worker\u2019s death occurs prior to issuance of a notice of closure under ORS 656.268, the insurer or the self-insured employer shall determine compensation for permanent partial disability, if any.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b621-8\">\u201c(3) If the worker has filed a request for a hearing pursuant to ORS 656.283 and death occurs prior to the final disposition of the request, the persons described in subsection (5) of this section shall be entitled to pursue the matter to final determination of all issues presented by the request for hearing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b621-9\">\u201c(4) If the worker dies before filing a request for hearing, the persons described in subsection (5) of this section shall be entitled to file a request for hearing and to pursue the matter to final determination as to all issues presented by the request for hearing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b621-10\">\u201c(5) The payments provided in this section shall be made to the persons who would have been entitled to receive death benefits if the injury causing the disability had been fatal. In the absence of persons so entitled, the unpaid balance of the award shall be paid to the worker\u2019s estate.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b622-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>When a worker who has filed a claim for benefits is entitled to compensation and dies of causes unrelated to the claim, \u201cwhether eligibility therefor or the amount thereof have been determined,\u201d the insurer must make payments \u201cfor the period during which the worker, if surviving, would have been entitled thereto.\u201d ORS 656.218(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b622-4\">When the deceased worker\u2019s eligibility for benefits has been determined, ORS 656.218(5) describes to whom those benefits are to be paid. Payments must be made \u201cto the persons who would have been entitled to receive death benefits if the injury causing the disability had been fatal.\u201d In the absence of \u201cpersons so entitled,\u201d the unpaid balance of the award \u201cshall be paid to the worker\u2019s estate.\u201d ORS 656.218(5).</p>\n<p id=\"b622-5\">When the deceased worker\u2019s eligibility for benefits or the amount of benefits has not yet been determined, the statute describes procedures for three scenarios: (1) Under ORS 656.218(2), when the worker dies before the insurer has issued a notice of closure, the insurer \u201cshall determine compensation for permanent partial disability, if any.\u201d (2) Under ORS 656.218(3), when the worker has requested a hearing and death occurs before final disposition of the request, \u201cthe persons described in subsection (5)\u201d are entitled to pursue the matter to final determination. (3) Under ORS 656.218(4), when the worker dies before requesting a hearing, \u201cthe persons described in subsection (5)\u201d are entitled to file a request for hearing and to pursue the matter to final determination. Thus, under both ORS 656.218(3) and (4), the persons entitled to pursue the claim are \u201cthe persons described in subsection (5).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b622-6\">As noted, subsection (5), in turn, describes who is entitled to receive the payments required to be made under ORS 656.218. The first sentence of ORS 656.218(5) \u2014 \u201cthe persons who would have been entitled to receive death benefits if the injury causing the disability had been fatal\u201d \u2014 is an unambiguous reference to the persons described in ORS 656.204, the worker\u2019s surviving spouse, minor children, and other dependents.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-7\">It is undisputed that, before his death, claimant\u2019s entitlement to benefits for his combined condition had not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>yet been finally determined, because the issue was pending before this court. Claimant had filed a request for hearing to challenge SAIF\u2019s denial of his combined condition claim. He appealed to the board the administrative law judge\u2019s (ALJ\u2019s) order upholding the denial and also sought judicial review in this court. However, his death occurred before a \u201cfinal determination of all issues presented by the request for hearing.\u201d <em>See </em>ORS 656.218(3); <em>SAIF v. Balcom, </em>162 Or App 325, 329, 986 P2d 104 (1999), <em>rev den, </em>329 Or 650 (2000) (a final disposition of such a request occurs when a final order has been entered on it that is not subject to further review by the board or the courts). Because claimant is not survived by any \u201cpersons who would have been entitled to receive death benefits if the injury causing the disability had been fatal,\u201d ORS 656.218(5), the question is whether claimant\u2019s estate is a \u201cperson described in subsection (5) * * * entitled to pursue the matter to final determination,\u201d pursuant to ORS 656.218(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b623-4\">We have considered this question under the former version of the statute,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and have held in several cases that the persons entitled to pursue a claim after the worker\u2019s death under ORS 656.218(3) are the same persons entitled to receive death benefits under ORS 656.204, and do not include the worker\u2019s estate or personal representative. <em>See Cato v. Alcoa-Reynolds Metals Co., </em>210 Or App 721, 730, 152 P3d 981 (2007), <em>rev den, </em>343 Or 115 (2007) (ORS 656.218(3) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>and (5) limit the right to pursue a hearing after the death of a worker to those who are entitled to death benefits under ORS 656.204); <em>Balcom, </em>162 Or App at 329 (same); <em>Edwards v. Cherry City Electric, Inc., </em>141 Or App 578, 583, 919 P2d 501 (1996) (same); <em>Trice v. Tektronix, Inc., </em>104 Or App 461, 465, 801 P2d 896 (1990) (same). In 2009, the legislative assembly amended ORS 656.218(5), Or Laws 2009, ch 171, \u00a7 2. This case presents the first opportunity to consider the issue under the current version of the statute, and we reach the same conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-4\">Most of the statute remains unchanged. Like its predecessor, the current version of ORS 656.218(1) provides that, when a worker who is entitled to compensation dies, \u201cpayments shall be made for the period during which the worker, if surviving, would have been entitled\u201d to compensation. Like its predecessor, the current version of ORS 656.218(3) describes the persons entitled to pursue a claim after the worker\u2019s death by referring to \u201cthe persons described in subsection (5).\u201d Subsection (5), in turn, continues to provide that the payments provided for in the statute \u201cshall be made to the persons who would have been entitled to receive death benefits if the injury causing the disability had been fatal.\u201d Those provisions were key to our conclusion in our earlier opinions that only the beneficiaries described in ORS 656.204 are entitled to pursue a claim. <em>See, e.g., Balcom, </em>162 Or App at 329; <em>Edwards, </em>141 Or App at 582.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-5\">In fact, the only amendment of ORS 656.218 in 2009 was to subsection (5), by the replacement of the subsection\u2019s former second sentence (\u201cIn the absence of persons so entitled, a burial allowance may be paid not to exceed the lesser of either the unpaid award or the amount payable by ORS 656.204.\u201d) with a new second sentence \u2014 \u201cIn the absence of persons so entitled, the unpaid balance of the award shall be paid to the worker\u2019s estate.\u201d ORS 656.218(5). The estate and the dissent assert that the estate\u2019s authority to pursue a hearing request is, in fact, derived from that second sentence. The dissent reasons that the new text brings the estate within the scope of the \u201cpersons described in subsection (5).\u201d The dissent contends that, when read together with subsection (1), that new sentence demonstrates a legislative <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>intention that, in the absence of statutory beneficiaries, the estate may pursue a deceased worker\u2019s undetermined claim. For several reasons, we disagree with that interpretation.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-4\">ORS 656.218(3) continues to describe the persons who may pursue a claim as \u201cthe persons described in subsection (5).\u201d The first sentence of ORS 656.218(5) continues to state that the payments required by the statute are to be made to \u201cthe persons who would have been entitled to receive death benefits [.]\u201d The most straightforward reading of the text is that those are the \u201cpersons\u201d to whom ORS 656.218(3) refers, and they do not include the worker\u2019s estate or personal representative. The new second sentence\u2019s requirement that, in the event that there are no \u201cpersons so entitled,\u201d \u201cthe unpaid balance of the award\u201d is to be paid to the estate does not alter our conclusion. That sentence reveals two factors central to its application: (1) an estate is not among the \u201cpersons so entitled,\u201d and (2) there exists a previous award with an \u201cunpaid balance,\u201d that is, the worker\u2019s entitlement to benefits has been previously determined. In other words, the second sentence is applicable when the deceased worker\u2019s eligibility for benefits or the amount of benefits has been determined \u2014 when there has been an award. In the absence of persons entitled to receive death benefits, the estate receives the remaining unpaid balance of an award previously determined. But, contrary to the dissent\u2019s reasoning, that sentence does not provide independent authority for the estate to pursue a claim that has not yet been determined.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-5\">The dissent\u2019s reading of ORS 656.218(1) as bolstering its interpretation is misplaced. The dissent focuses on the subsection\u2019s statement that, \u201cwhether eligibility therefor or the amount thereof have been determined, payments <em>shall be made </em>for the period during which the worker, if surviving, would have been entitled thereto.\u201d (Emphasis added.) In the dissent\u2019s view, that subsection creates an absolute right to pursue undetermined benefits, either by the statutory beneficiaries or, if there are none, by the estate. With respect, the subsection must be read in its context, which includes subsections (2) through (5) and the limitations that we have described on who may pursue a claim for benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>Other context also supports our conclusion that the amendment of ORS 656.218(5) was not intended to effect a substantive amendment to who is entitled to pursue a request for hearing under ORS 656.218(3). When the legislature amended ORS 656.218(5) by eliminating the provision for a \u201cburial allowance\u201d and authorizing the estate to receive unpaid awards, it made a similar change to ORS 656.204(l)(b), which had previously provided for payment for the cost of \u201cburial.\u201d As amended by Oregon Laws 2009, section (l)(b), ORS 656.204(1) no longer provides for payment of the cost of burial, but instead requires the insurer to pay bills for disposition and funeral expenses, not to exceed 20 times the worker\u2019s average weekly wage. It provides, further, that \u201cany part of the [funeral] benefit that remains unpaid 60 days after claim acceptance\u201d is to be paid to the estate of the worker. ORS 656.204(l)(b). Those changes, together with the amendment to ORS 656.218(5), reflect a consistent intention that, when an award has been made and there are no surviving statutory beneficiaries of the worker as defined in ORS 656.204, the estate must receive any previously awarded benefits. The legislative history supports our interpretation.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b627-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>Having concluded that claimant\u2019s estate and personal representative are not entitled to pursue claimant\u2019s petition for judicial review, we grant SAIF\u2019s motion to dismiss the petition. In light of that ruling, we deny the personal representative\u2019s motion to be substituted as claimant on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-4\">Personal representative\u2019s motion to be substituted as claimant denied; respondents\u2019 motion to dismiss granted; petition for judicial review dismissed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b619-9\"> Although claimant conceded that the accepted lumbar strain was no longer the cause of his combined condition, he contended that, in assessing the compensability of his combined condition claim, the board made the wrong inquiry\u2014 whether the <em>accepted condition </em>continues to be the major contributing cause of his disability or need for treatment. In claimant\u2019s view, the proper inquiry was whether the <em>accidental injury </em>continues to be the major contributing cause of his combined condition. <em>See Brown v. SAIF, </em>262 Or App 640, 325 P3d 834 (2014) (so holding). Claimant contended that there was no evidence that the \u201caccidental injury\u201d is no longer the major contributing cause of his disability or need for treatment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b623-5\"> Before 2009, ORS 656.218 provided, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b623-6\">\u201c(1) In case of the death of a worker entitled to compensation, whether eligibility therefor or the amount thereof have been determined, payments shall be made for the period during which the worker, if surviving, would have been entitled thereto.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b623-7\">\u201c(3) If the worker has filed a request for a hearing pursuant to ORS 656.283 and death occurs prior to the final disposition of the request, the persons described in subsection (5) of this section shall be entitled to pursue the matter to final determination of all issues presented by the request for hearing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b623-8\">s}:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b623-9\">\u201c(5) The payments provided in this section shall be made to the persons who would have been entitled to receive death benefits if the injury causing the disability had been fatal.

The purpose of that study, which was submitted to the legislative committees considering SB 110, was to examine the adequacy of death-related benefits that were available to workers\u2019 families and dependents under the workers\u2019 compensation laws. With regard to the proposed amendment to ORS 656.218, the MLAC study stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b626-5\">\u201cORS 656.218 states that if a worker dies before his or her permanent partial disability award is paid in full and the worker has a spouse or dependent children, the insurer pays the full remainder of the award to them. However, the law also states that if the worker does not have a spouse or dependent children, the insurer only pays the statutory burial amount <em>or </em>the remaining permanent partial disability award, whichever is less. MLAC concluded that the insurer should be obligated to pay the full remaining award, whether or not the worker has a spouse or children.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b626-6\">The MLAC study recommended:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b626-7\">\u201cClarify ORS 656.218 to state when a worker without statutory dependents dies before his or her permanent partial disability award is paid in full, the insurer must pay the full amount of the remaining award to the worker\u2019s estate.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b626-8\"><em>\u201cSB 110 includes this </em>recommendation.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b626-9\">Testimony, Senate Committee on Commerce and Workforce Development, SB 110, Jan 28, 2009, Ex 5 (Senate Bill 835 (2007) Death Benefit Study Report) (emphasis in original).

So they\u2019re paid differently depending \u2014 the estates, basically \u2014 are paid differently depending on whether the worker has statutory beneficiaries. What [MLAC] is recommending is that the worker with no surviving beneficiaries \u2014 spouse or dependent children \u2014 would receive the full remainder of their permanent disability award and that [it] be paid to the worker\u2019s estate.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b627-12\">Testimony, Senate Committee on Commerce and Workforce Development, SB 110, Jan 28, 2009 (statement of Workers\u2019 Compensation Division Administrator John Shilts).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b627-5\">EGAN, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AHR\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-6\">The majority concludes that, although claimant\u2019s estate is entitled to the unpaid balance of claimant\u2019s worker\u2019s compensation award \u201cwhether eligibility therefor or the amount thereof have been determined,\u201d the estate is not entitled to pursue that award.

In the absence of persons so entitled, a burial allowance may be paid not to exceed the lesser of either the unpaid award or the amount payable by ORS 656.204.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b628-8\">In 2009, the legislature amended subsection (5), which now reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b628-9\">\u201cThe payments provided in this section shall be made to the persons who would have been entitled to receive death benefits if the injury causing the disability had been fatal. <em>In the absence of persons so entitled, the unpaid balance of the award shall be paid to the worker\u2019s estate.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b628-11\">ORS 656.218(5) (emphasis added). When it named the deceased worker\u2019s estate as an alternative beneficiary in the absence of statutory dependents, the legislature added a new class of beneficiary that did not exist before, one that is entitled to receive a deceased worker\u2019s compensation award in the event that worker dies without statutory dependents.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The question is whether the legislature also intended to endow that new beneficiary class with the corresponding right to pursue a pending claim or, rather, to confine the estate to collect payments only on those awards that had already been made while the worker was alive.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"609\">*609</page-number>I cannot join in the majority\u2019s conclusion that the legislature intended the latter result. The majority\u2019s conclusion that ORS 656.218(5) does not allow a personal representative to pursue an award ascribes to the legislature the intent to create a right to receive payments \u201cwhether eligibility therefor or the amount thereof have been determined\u201d while simultaneously denying a means of pursuing that right. The effect of that conclusion is not hard to discern: Where a worker dies without statutory beneficiaries during the pendency of that worker\u2019s claim, the insurer may now avoid making payments on an award that ORS 656.218(1) and (5) require \u201cshall\u201d be made to the worker\u2019s estate. Thus, the majority\u2019s conclusion effectively nullifies a significant provision of ORS 656.218(1), which, again, provides that, in the absence of statutory dependents, payments \u201cshall be made\u201d to the estate \u201cwhether eligibility therefor or the amount thereof have been determined.\u201d <em>See </em>ORS 174.010 (\u201c[WJhere there are several provisions or particulars such construction is, if possible, to be adopted as will give effect to all.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b629-4\">I also note that the 2009 amendment was adopted in the context of the general rule of ORS 114.305(19), which provides that a personal representative is authorized to \u201c[p]rosecute or defend actions, claims or proceedings * * * for the protection of the estate and of the personal representative in the performance of duties as personal representative.\u201d <em>See </em>ORS 114.305(20) (the personal representative is entitled to \u201c[p]rosecute claims of the decedent\u201d); <em>see also Young v. State of Oregon, </em>161 Or App 32, 35, 963 P2d 1044, <em>rev den, </em>329 Or 447 (1999) (the context of a statute includes related statutes). In other words, ORS 656.218 \u2014 insofar as it limits who may pursue a deceased worker\u2019s claim to those \u201cpersons\u201d identified in subsection (5) \u2014 serves as an exception to the general rule that a personal representative may pursue actions on behalf of the deceased. I thus find it especially difficult to ascribe to the legislature the simultaneous intent to require that payments be made to an estate, but \u2014 in deviation from the rule allowing an estate to pursue an action on a deceased\u2019s behalf \u2014 to deny the estate the ability to pursue those payments.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"610\">*610</page-number>At the heart of the majority\u2019s conclusion lies the fact that subsection (3) limits who may pursue an award by a reference to the \u201cpersons\u201d described in subsection (5). It reasons that because one class of beneficiaries \u2014 statutory dependents \u2014 is described by reference to its members\u2019 status as persons, and the other \u2014 the estate \u2014 is not, that the legislature did not intend to describe the estate in subsection (3). 262 Or App 604-05. Although it is true that subsection (5) describes only one class of persons, I believe that the majority\u2019s interpretation overlooks the fact that subsection (5) now describes two alternative classes of beneficiaries. Subsection (5) serves two functions. Per subsection (1), it describes who is entitled to receive the \u201cpayments provided in this section.\u201d Per subsection (3), it \u201cdescribe[s] \u201d who may pursue a claim to a final determination. The majority\u2019s position assigns to the legislature the intent to disrupt what has, heretofore, been the naturally coextensive reach of those two functions.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-4\">ORS 656.218 has long provided that a deceased worker\u2019s payments continue \u201cto the persons who would have been entitled to receive death benefits if the injury causing disability had been fatal.\u201d <em>E.g., </em>ORS 656.218(2) (1953). Before the 2009 amendment, there was no alternative disposition for that award in the absence of statutory dependents, but instead only an alternative type of benefit. <em>See Edwards v. Cherry City Electric, Inc., </em>141 Or App 578, 582-83, 919 P2d 501 (1996) (explaining preamended version of ORS 656.218). Until 1973, however, the statute did not provide who was entitled to pursue a claim that was pending at the time of the worker\u2019s death. That is, the statute referenced \u201cpersons\u201d only as a means of identifying the one \u2014 and, then, only \u2014 beneficiary class entitled to payment. In 1973, the legislature added subsection (3) to explicitly state who could pursue a deceased worker\u2019s claim. Or Laws 1973, ch 355, \u00a7 1. As the statute already happened to define the one\u2014 and only \u2014 beneficiary class in terms of \u201cpersons,\u201d the 1973 legislature quite naturally limited the ability to pursue a claim by referencing that one beneficiary class in terms of its constituents, <em>viz., </em>\u201cpersons.\u201d In other words, the 1973 legislature made the ability to pursue a deceased worker\u2019s payments coextensive with the right to collect those payments. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"611\">*611</page-number>I consider it unlikely that the 2009 legislature meant to divorce a beneficiary\u2019s right to payment from the ability to pursue that payment based on that beneficiary\u2019s status, <em>vel non, </em>as a \u201cperson.\u201d Instead, it is more natural to conclude that the 2009 legislature intended the would-be beneficiary\u2019s membership in one or the other of those beneficiary classes \u201cdescribed\u201d by subsection (5) as the determinative factor in who may pursue that claim.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b631-4\">Last, I note that, although the legislative history behind the 2009 amendment does not, in my mind, provide any conclusive evidence of legislative intent one way or the other, the majority\u2019s conclusion is at odds with at least two of the animating purposes behind the amendment. Specifically, the amendment was intended both to create a new type of beneficiary and to equalize treatment between those workers who died with statutory dependents and those who died without them, <em>i.e., </em>the two beneficiary classes \u201cdescribed\u201d by subsection (5). <em>See </em>262 Or App at 606 n 3. Both of those purposes will be hindered under the majority\u2019s conclusion that the alternative beneficiary, the estate, cannot pursue a claim for payments.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-5\">For those reasons, I would accordingly conclude that claimant\u2019s son, in his capacity as personal representative of claimant\u2019s estate, is entitled to pursue claimant\u2019s compensation claim and I would deny SAIF\u2019s motion to dismiss and grant the motion to substitute claimant\u2019s personal representative as the real party in interest. I would accordingly proceed to address the merits of the petition for judicial review. For the reasons explained in <em>Brown v. SAIF, </em>262 Or App 640, 325 P3d 834 (2014), I would reverse the board\u2019s decision and remand this case for the board to reconsider under the correct legal standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-6\">I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b628-12\"> Specifically, ORS 656.218(5) (2007) refers to \u201cthe persons who would have been entitled to receive death benefits if the injury causing the disability had been fatal.\u201d ORS 656.204 identifies that class of beneficiaries, a class that, for simplicity\u2019s sake, I will refer to as \u201cstatutory dependents.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b631-7\"> The majority also relies on the fact that ORS 656.218(5) references \u201cthe unpaid balance of the award\u201d as support for its conclusion that an estate is only entitled to receive payments on an already-existing award. With respect, the majority fails to read that provision within the context of the statute as a whole; when so read, the statute provides that the worker\u2019s estate is entitled to receive \u201cthe unpaid balance of the award\u201d \u201cwhether eligibility therefor or the amount thereof have been determined.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
