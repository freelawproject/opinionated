Because we hold that the exclusive remedy provisions of the workers\u2019 compensation statute, General Statutes \u00a7 31-284,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> do not prohibit an employee from obtaining benefits pursuant to the underinsurance coverage of his employer\u2019s personal automobile policy, we reverse the decision of the trial court granting the plaintiff\u2019s application to vacate an arbitration award.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"652\">*652</page-number>The defendant<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> was injured in an automobile collision while acting within the scope of his employment and operating an automobile owned by his employer. His employer\u2019s automobile, along with three other vehicles owned by the employer, was insured under a personal automobile policy issued by the plaintiff insurance company. Each of the vehicles carried $40,000 in uninsured-underinsured motorist coverage. After exhausting the tortfeasor\u2019s liability coverage of $20,000 and receiving workers\u2019 compensation benefits of $38,758.67, the defendant commenced a compulsory arbitration proceeding seeking underinsured motorist benefits from his employer\u2019s underinsured motorist coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-5\">The arbitration panel concluded that the Connecticut workers\u2019 compensation statute does not preclude further recovery against the employer\u2019s underinsured motorist coverage. The plaintiff then filed an application to vacate the arbitration award. The trial court granted that application, concluding that the defendant\u2019s claim is barred by this court\u2019s decision in <em>Ross </em>v. <em>New Haven, </em>19 Conn. App. 169, 561 A.2d 457, cert. granted, 212 Conn. 814, 565 A.2d 536 (1989).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> After <em>Ross </em>was decided, however, our Supreme Court effectively overruled <em>Ross </em>in the case of <em>Wilson </em>v. <em>Security Ins. Co., </em>213 Conn. 532, 569 A.2d 40, cert. denied, U.S. , 111 S. Ct. 52, 112 L. Ed. 2d 28 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b676-7\">In <em>Wilson, </em>an employee was allowed to recover uninsured motorist benefits where the employer had obtained a separate uninsured motorist policy from an outside insurer. We have concluded in our recent case of <em>Bouley </em>v. <em>Norwich, 25 </em>Conn. App. 492, 595 A.2d 884 (1991), that <em>Wilson </em>is the present law and that there <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"653\">*653</page-number>should not be any difference between an employer who is a self-insurer and an employer who obtains insurance from an independent insurance company. In either case, the exclusivity provision of General Statutes \u00a7 31-284 does not bar an employee who has received workers\u2019 compensation benefits from also obtaining uninsured or underinsured motorist benefits reduced by any workers\u2019 compensation benefits paid or payable.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-5\">The judgment is reversed and the case is remanded with direction to render judgment denying the plaintiff\u2019s application to vacate the arbitration award.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b675-12\"> General Statutes \u00a7 31-284 provides as follows: \u201c(a) An employer shall not be liable to any action for damages on account of personal injury sustained by an employee arising out of and in the course of his employment . . . but an employer shall secure compensation for his employees as follows. ... All rights and claims between employer and employees . . . arising out of personal injury . . . sustained in the course of employment . . . are abolished other than rights and claims given by this chapter, provided nothing herein shall prohibit any employee from securing, by agreement with his employer, additional benefits from his employer for such injury or from enforcing such agreement for additional benefits.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b676-8\"> The wife of Frank Colman, Shirley Colman, is also a defendant.
