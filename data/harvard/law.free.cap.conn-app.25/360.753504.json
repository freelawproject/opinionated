We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-5\">The plaintiff brought the underlying action against the defendants, Brown Thompson and Company, Metropolitan Properties, Inc., and the Richardson Associates (Brown Thompson) in April, 1988, based on injuries she allegedly sustained as the result of a slip and fall on the premises of a restaurant owned by Brown Thompson.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-6\">On December 28,1988, Brown Thompson impleaded Clarence Butler, doing business as Clarence Butler and Sons (Butler), as a third party defendant by a third party complaint seeking indemnification against Butler for his alleged negligence in cleaning and maintaining the floor in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-7\">On January 2,1990, Butler filed a fourth party complaint seeking indemnification from Dalene Hardwood Floor Company, Inc. (Dalene), Minwax Company and Leese Flooring Supplies, Inc., as fourth party defendants. The first count of the fourth party complaint claimed a right of indemnification based on Dalene\u2019s allegedly negligent instructions regarding the type of wax to use and the application of that wax to the floor in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>On March 22, 1990, Dalene filed a motion to strike the first count of the fourth party complaint on the ground that the cause of action alleged was barred by the three year statute of limitations set forth in General Statutes \u00a7 52-577. On November 15,1990, the trial court granted Dalene\u2019s motion to strike, reasoning that the three year limitations period began to run on or before May 13,1986, the day the plaintiff allegedly fell.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-5\">On appeal, Butler claims that the trial court improperly granted Dalene\u2019s motion to strike because it incorrectly concluded that the statute of limitations set forth in \u00a7 52-577 began to run on the date of the negligent act or omission on which the underlying cause of action is based. Rather, Butler contends, because the fourth party complaint claimed a right of indemnification, the event that would trigger the limitations period contained in \u00a7 52-577 was the potential future judgment and resulting demand for payment of said judgment on which the right to indemnification was founded.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-6\">Our analysis of Butler\u2019s claim begins with the pertinent statutory language. General Statutes \u00a7 52-102a (b),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Connecticut\u2019s impleader statute, provides in pertinent part: \u201cthe third-party defendant, shall have available to him all remedies available to an original defendant . . . .\u201d The \u201call remedies\u201d clause contained in General Statutes \u00a7 52-102a (b) preserves the statute of limitations defense for third party defendants. See <em>Vincent </em>v. <em>Litchfield Farms, Inc., </em>21 Conn. App. 524, 528, 574 A.2d 834, cert. denied, 215 Conn. 815, 576 A.2d 544 (1990). The term \u201cthird-party defendant\u201d as used in \u00a7 52-102a clearly includes any party impleaded by operation of that statute. Thus, Dalene may properly raise the statute of limitations to bar Butler\u2019s action for indemnification.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>The applicable statute of limitations provides that \u201c[n]o action founded upon a tort shall be brought but within three years from the date of the act or omission complained of.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 52-577. \u201cThe exact wording of the statute, barring the bringing of any action founded upon a tort <em>\u2018but within three years from the date of the act or omission complained of, \u2019 </em>pinpoints the basic question here as being just what actually constituted \u2018the act or omission complained of . . .\u201d in Butler\u2019s claim for indemnification. (Emphasis in original.) <em>Prokolkin </em>v. <em>General Motors Corporation, </em>170 Conn. 289, 294, 365 A.2d 1180 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b386-5\">At common law, statutes of limitations did not begin to run until the accrual of an action, and an action for indemnification did not accrue until the entry of final judgment against the party seeking indemnification. <em>McEvoy </em>v. <em>Waterbury, </em>92 Conn. 664, 667, 104 A. 164 (1918). However, \u201c[i]n adopting [the \u2018act or omission complained of\u2019] language, our legislature distinguished Connecticut\u2019s statutes of limitations for torts from those of other jurisdictions, the majority of which begin to run only \u2018after the cause of action has accrued.\u2019 \u201d <em>Prokolkin </em>v. <em>General Motors Corporation, </em>supra, 294-95. \u201c \u2018The date of the act or omission complained of is the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>date when the negligent conduct of the defendant occurs and is not the date when the plaintiff first sustains damage\u2019 . . . .\u201d Id., 297, quoting <em>Vilcinskas </em>v. <em>Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co., </em>144 Conn. 170, 173, 127 A.2d 814 (1956). \u201cBecause of the distinction created in the Connecticut limitation statute between the injury and the tortious conduct that caused it, it is, indeed, possible, on occasions, to bar an action even before the cause of action accrues.\u201d <em>Prokolkin </em>v. <em>General Motors Corporation, </em>supra, 296; see also <em>Vilcinskas </em>v. <em>Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co., </em>supra, 174.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-5\"><em>As Prokolkin </em>makes clear, the aforementioned principles control actions based on a right of indemnification as well as direct causes of action. See <em>Prokolkin </em>v. <em>General Motors Corporation, </em>supra, 302-303. The \u201cact or omission complained of\u201d for the purposes of Butler\u2019s indemnification claim against Dalene is the alleged negligence of Dalene in instructing on the type of wax to use and the application of the wax to Brown Thompson\u2019s floor. These acts necessarily occurred, if at all, before May 13,1986, the date of the alleged fall. Because Butler\u2019s fourth party action for indemnification against Dalene was not brought until January 2, 1990, the trial court properly concluded that the action was barred by General Statutes \u00a7 52-577 as not brought \u201cwithin three years from the date of the act or omission complained of.\u201d See General Statutes \u00a7 52-577.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-7\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b384-8\"> General Statutes \u00a7 52-577 provides: \u201cNo action founded upon a tort shall be brought but within three years from the date of the act or omission complained of.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b385-7\"> In its reply brief, Butler argues for the first time that General Statutes \u00a7 52-577 is not the controlling statute of limitations. This claim was not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>raised at trial, however, and was not included in the \u201cstatement of issues\u201d section of Butler\u2019s brief. See Practice Book \u00a7 4065 (a).</p>\n<p id=\"b386-7\">It is a rule of long standing that claims of error not distinctly raised at trial will not be reviewed on appeal. <em>Goold </em>v. <em>Goold, </em>11 Conn. App. 268, 282, 527 A.2d 696 (1987); <em>Hanson </em>v. <em>Department of Income Maintenance, </em>10 Conn. App. 14, 18, 521 A.2d 208 (1987). \u201cWe have repeatedly held that this court -will not consider claimed errors on the part of the trial court unless it appears on the record that the question was distinctly raised at trial and was ruled upon and decided by the court adversely to the appellant\u2019s claim . . . . \u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>Keating </em>v. <em>Glass Container Corporation, </em>197 Conn. 428, 431, 497 A.2d 763 (1985). Furthermore, we will not review a claim raised for the first time in the reply brief. <em>L. F. Pace &amp; Sons, Inc. </em>v. <em>Traveler\u2019s Indemnity Co., </em>9 Conn. App. 30, 45 n.8, 514 A.2d 766, cert. denied, 201 Conn. 811, 516 A.2d 866 (1986). Accordingly, we decline to review this claim.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
