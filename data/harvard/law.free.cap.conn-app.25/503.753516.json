We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-6\">The following facts are necessary for the resolution of this case. From 1985 until December, 1987, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>defendant and the victim were romantically involved. In December, 1987, the victim severed her relationship with the defendant. After their breakup, the defendant began repeatedly calling the victim at home and at work. On January 23, 1988, the defendant telephoned the victim and threatened her, stating that she would be sorry if she did not get back together with him. The victim filed a complaint with the Milford police department, but did not seek the defendant\u2019s arrest at that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-5\">On February 14,1988, the defendant telephoned the victim at her apartment and asked her to go to lunch with him. She refused his invitation and turned on her answering machine to avoid further calls from him. After the victim showered and got dressed, she noticed that her cat was standing by the door. She opened the door and the defendant forced his way into her apartment, forced her onto the sofa, and sexually assaulted her. The victim then retreated to the bathroom and locked the bathroom door behind her. She stayed in this room until the defendant left the apartment.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-6\">After the defendant left her apartment, the victim called a friend, who advised the victim to call 911. The victim then dialed 911 and reported that she had been sexually assaulted and named the defendant as her assailant. The defendant was arrested and charged with first degree sexual assault and burglary in the third degree, and was released on bond.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-7\">On February 16, 1988, the victim began to keep a written record of telephone calls from the defendant. On February 17, she logged seventy calls. The police put a trap on the defendant\u2019s business telephone line and it registered thirty-four calls to the victim on February 16 and 17, 1988. The defendant made additional calls to the victim on February 18, 1988. The defendant was arrested again and charged with harass<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>ment. He was again released on bond with the condition that he stay away from the victim. His bond was later raised to $100,000 after he admitted that he had violated that condition. Although he could not raise this amount initially, he was later released after posting the bond.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-5\">On June 21, 1988, the defendant phoned the victim at her health club. As a result of this phone call, the defendant was again arrested and charged with harassment and tampering with a witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-6\">The defendant moved for acquittal on all charges at the close of the state\u2019s case, claiming that there was insufficient evidence to prove the defendant\u2019s guilt. The court granted the defendant\u2019s motion as to the harassment charges that arose out of the telephone calls of February 16, 17, and 18, 1988, and as to the charges of tampering with a witness that arose out of a telephone call to the victim\u2019s health club on June 21,1988.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b529-8\">Motion to Strike</p>\n<p id=\"b529-9\">The defendant first claims that the trial court improperly denied his motion to strike certain testimony based on the state\u2019s failure to produce the 911 and police broadcast tapes. As a preliminary matter, we note that the defendant never moved to strike any of the officers\u2019 testimony relating to the police broadcast tapes at trial. Practice Book \u00a7 4185 provides in pertinent part that this court \u201cshall not be bound to consider a claim unless it was distinctly raised at the trial or arose subsequent to the trial.\u201d Further, the defendant bears the burden of seeking a definitive ruling on the striking of each witnesses\u2019 testimony, after each has testified at trial, in order to comply fully with our rules of practice and to preserve his claim of error as to each witness. <em>State </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>214 Conn. 161, 170, 571 A.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>79 (1990). Because the defendant did not properly preserve his claim with respect to the police broadcast tapes, we will not consider it. We therefore focus our analysis solely on the trial court\u2019s refusal to strike the victim\u2019s testimony in light of the Milford police department\u2019s destruction of the 911 tape.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-5\">The following facts are necessary to the resolution of this claim. At trial, the victim testified that when she called her friend after the defendant had left the apartment, she told her, \u201cTony assaulted me.\u201d The victim also testified that when she dialed 911 to report the incident, she told the police that the defendant had raped her. When the victim\u2019s friend testified, she stated that when the victim telephoned her immediately after the incident she said, \u201cTony hit me.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b530-6\">Before the trial began, the trial court granted the defendant\u2019s motion for discovery seeking \u201c[cjopies of statements of prosecution witnesses in the possession of the State or its agents, including state and local law enforcement officers, which statements relate to the subject matter about which the witness will testify . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Although the 911 call was tape-recorded when it was made, this tape was erased thirty days after the incident pursuant to Milford police department policy. Consequently, the state was unable to produce the tapes at the time of trial. The defendant contends that the destruction of the 911 tape and the state\u2019s inability to produce it violated his rights under General Statutes \u00a7 54-86b and Practice Book \u00a7 752. He also alleges that the 911 tapes could have explained the discrepancy between the victim\u2019s testimony and that of her friend, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>and that its nonproduction violated his right to confrontation as guaranteed under the state and federal constitutions. We agree with the defendant that the state\u2019s failure to produce the 911 tape violated our rules of practice, but we conclude, nonetheless, that this violation was harmless on the facts of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-5\">Although the law in this area is still evolving, past cases have analyzed the destruction of 911 tape recordings in the same way that we have analyzed the destruction of any other recorded statement. Compare <em>State </em>v. <em>Pollitt, </em>205 Conn. 61, 85-87, 530 A.2d 155 (1987) (defendant suffered no substantial prejudice from the loss of the victim\u2019s 911 statement), with <em>State </em>v. <em>Belle, </em>215 Conn. 257, 268, 576 A.2d 139 (1990) (defendant not prejudiced by destruction of victim\u2019s statements before trial).</p>\n<p id=\"b531-6\">Practice Book \u00a7 752 provides that, upon a defendant\u2019s request, the state must disclose \u201cany statement of the witness in the possession of the state or its agents . . . .\u201d See General Statutes \u00a7 54-86b. The disclosure provisions of \u00a7 54-86b and Practice Book \u00a7 752 apply to a 911 tape recording. <em>State </em>v. <em>Williamson, </em>14 Conn. App. 108, 112-13, 552 A.2d 815 (1988), aff'd, 212 Conn. 6, 562 A.2d 470 (1989). The state was unable to comply with this requirement at trial because of the police department\u2019s routine erasure of the 911 tape.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-7\">The state acknowledges that the 911 tape is a statement within the meaning of Practice Book \u00a7 749 (2),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and the defendant concedes that the tape was not destroyed in bad faith,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> or by a deliberate act intended to thwart <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>the defense. Where, as here, \u201c \u2018a case involves intentional, but not bad faith, destruction of the statement of a state\u2019s witness, an automatic sanction of striking that witness\u2019testimony is not required. . . .\u2019 <em>State </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>214 Conn. 161, 168, 571 A.2d 79 (1990). Rather, under such circumstances, \u2018it is appropriate that the court weigh \u201c \u2018the culpability of the state for its failure to make disclosable material available on the one hand, against any resulting prejudice to the defendant on the other. . . .\u2019 \u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Williamson, </em>[212 Conn. 6, 14, 562 A.2d 470 (1989)]. This approach gives broad discretion to the trial court. Id. Where . . . the destruction of a witness\u2019 statement, although not in bad faith, is deliberate, the state properly bears the burden of establishing harmlessness. . . . \u201c[T]he proper harmless error inquiry is whether the result of the trial may have been different had the state not violated the rule.\u201d . . .\u2019 \u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Belle, </em>supra; <em>State </em>v. <em>Dedrick, </em>24 Conn. App. 518, 589 A.2d 1241 (1991). Where the state\u2019s failure to produce the tape rises to the level of a denial of the defendant\u2019s right to confrontation the state must prove harmlessness beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>State </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>214 Conn. 161, 175, 571 A.2d 79 (1990). Where the state\u2019s failure does not rise to this level, however, the appropriate inquiry is whether the state has proven that it is more probable than not that the state\u2019s nonproduction was harmless. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-5\">The trial court found that the defendant\u2019s constitutional right to confrontation was not violated, and that he was not prejudiced by the state\u2019s inability to produce the 911 tape. We agree. Any credibility issue that arose because of the conflict between the victim\u2019s testimony and that of her friend was placed squarely before the jury, and, thus, the defendant\u2019s constitutional right to confrontation was not violated. Further, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>the analysis under the state constitution found in the defendant\u2019s brief acknowledges that the state\u2019s failure to preserve the 911 tape is a Jencks<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> material type violation. Our Supreme Court has held that a claim relating to Jencks material is not of constitutional proportion. <em>State </em>v. <em>Myers, </em>193 Conn. 457, 469, 479 A.2d 199 (1984). We decline the defendant\u2019s invitation to expand this rule of law. Thus, we will apply the more probable than not standard, which is the analysis that is mandated in <em>State </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>supra. In applying this standard, we conclude that the defendant was not prejudiced by the absence of the 911 tape.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-5\">The importance of the 911 tape in the context of the entire trial is insignificant. The theory of defense was that the defendant and the victim had had sexual intercourse at the time and place as claimed by the victim, but that their encounter was consensual. Even if the victim had merely told her friend that \u201cTony hit me,\u201d that statement itself would be contrary to the defendant\u2019s assertion of consensual sexual intercourse. From this perspective the victim\u2019s characterization of the crime has been consistent. Whether she told her friend that the defendant had \u201chit\u201d or \u201cassaulted\u201d her, she nonetheless indicated that a struggle had taken place between her and the defendant during the undisputed sexual relations. Following the same logic, it is inconsequential whether she told the 911 operator that she had been \u201cassaulted\u201d or \u201craped,\u201d especially in view of the fact that a rape is a sexual assault. Thus, it is unreasonable to conclude that the jury\u2019s verdict would have been different had the tape been available to them, in that it is illogical that the victim would have dialed 911 to report consensual sexual relations. The trial court properly denied the defendant\u2019s motion to strike.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>Our analysis does not end here, however, because we recognize that the indefinite preservation of 911 tapes can place an unreasonable burden on police departments. We therefore now address the question of the rule for police departments to follow for the future preservation of 911 tapes.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-5\">We hold that commencing from this date, 911 tapes are excluded from that portion of Practice Book \u00a7 752<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> that states that a defendant may refrain from moving for production of statements until after a state\u2019s witness has testified. Henceforth, police departments are mandated to keep and maintain all 911 tapes for a period of one year from the date of the 911 call. This is consistent with the period mandated by Practice Book \u00a7 956B (b),<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> the speedy trial rule. In this way all <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>police departments are placed on notice that they must preserve 911 tape recordings for one year from the date on which they are recorded. If a defendant does not request the preservation of a 911 recording within this time, the police are then free to erase the tape and reuse it. Conversely, when a defendant does request the preservation of a 911 tape within the one year time period, it would be a per se violation of Practice Book \u00a7\u00a7 751 et seq. and General Statutes \u00a7 54-86b if the police were to erase the requested tape, and the trial court would have no recourse but to strike the relevant witness\u2019 testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-5\">A one year period gives a defendant ample time to enter a plea, file his discovery motions pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7\u00a7 809<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and 811,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> discover the existence of a 911 recording, and request the tape\u2019s preservation. Likewise, this one year limitation would relieve some of the burden previously placed on police departments by the current practice. Of course, this new rule presupposes an arrest within a reasonable length of time after the 911 call is made. Should the police inves<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>tigation be protracted, however, the police shall bear the burden of preserving the tape for one year from the date of arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b536-6\">Motion for Severance</p>\n<p id=\"b536-7\">The defendant filed a pretrial motion for severance requesting a separate trial for the crimes charged in each of four separate informations,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> and the state moved for joinder of the charges. The defendant\u2019s motion was denied and the state\u2019s motion was granted. On appeal, the defendant claims that the trial court improperly denied his motion for severance, and, consequently, denied his state and federal rights to due process and a fair trial. The state argues that because there is a common legal relationship among the crimes charged in the four informations, the trial court did not abuse its discretion when it denied the defendant\u2019s motion for severance. We agree with the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-8\">\u201cGeneral Statutes \u00a7 54-57<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> and Practice Book \u00a7 829<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> authorize a trial court to order a defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>to be tried jointly on charges arising separately. In deciding whether to sever informations joined for trial, the trial court enjoys broad discretion, which, in the absence of manifest abuse, an appellate court may not disturb.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Herring, </em>210 Conn. 78, 94, 554 A.2d 686, cert. denied, 492 U.S. 912, 109 S. Ct. 3230, 106 L. Ed. 2d 579 (1989). \u201cThe defendant bears a heavy burden of showing that \u2018 \u201cdenial of severance resulted in substantial injustice,\u201d and that any resulting prejudice was \u201cbeyond the curative power of the court\u2019s instructions.\u201d \u2019 \u201d Id., 94-95. Where the state\u2019s orderly presentation of evidence has prevented confusion of the jury and has enabled the jurors to consider the evidence relevant to each offense separately and distinctly, we will not conclude that the trial court has manifestly abused its discretion in denying the defendant\u2019s motion for severance. <em>State </em>v. <em>Pollitt, </em>205 Conn. 61, 68, 530 A.2d 155 (1987). \u201cWhere evidence of one incident can be admitted at the trial of [another incident], separate trials would provide the defendant no significant benefit. It is clear that, under such circumstances, the defendant would not ordinarily be substantially prejudiced by joinder of the offenses for a single trial.\u201d (Emphasis omitted.) Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-5\">As we have noted, the informations contained charges of sexual assault in the first degree, burglary in the third degree, tampering with a witness, and three counts of harassment. The event that triggered the defendant\u2019s actions was the deterioration of his romantic relationship with the victim. Evidence of the defendant\u2019s threats and harassing phone calls provided probative evidence of the defendant\u2019s motive and intent on the burglary and sexual assault charges. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Ramsundar, </em>204 Conn. 4, 14-16, 526 A.2d 1311, 484 U.S. 955, 108 S. Ct. 348, 98 L. Ed. 2d 374 (1987) (evidence of prior misconduct and conviction for harass<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>ment of this victim that followed the termination of a romantic relationship admissible to prove intent and motive); see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Thomas, </em>205 Conn. 279, 285, 533 A.2d 553 (1987) (evidence of deteriorating relationship and threats admissible to show defendant\u2019s motive); and <em>State </em>v. <em>Graham, </em>13 Conn. App. 554, 565, 538 A.2d 236 (1987), cert. denied, 207 Conn. 812, 541 A.2d 1241 (1988) (where threats are tied to defendant, evidence of those threats is generally admissible either on the theory that they are inconsistent with the defendant\u2019s claim of innocence, or that the defendant\u2019s conduct exhibits a consciousness of guilt). Because evidence for all counts charged would have been admissible in a trial on the first information charging sexual assault and burglary, it was, therefore, in the interest of judicial economy to join the charges in the four informations for trial. In addition, we conclude that the trial court\u2019s instruction to the jury specifically informed the jurors of which charges the defendant had been acquitted, instructed them as to what evidence was no longer in the case, and reminded the jurors that they must reach their verdict as to each count separately. The trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying the defendant\u2019s motion for severance.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b538-6\">Due Process Violations</p>\n<p id=\"b538-7\">The defendant next claims that the trial court violated his right to due process on three separate occasions when it allowed the state to elicit evidence of the invocation of his constitutional rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-8\">The following facts are necessary to the resolution of this claim. First, the defendant argues that during the state\u2019s direct examination of Officer Kevin Calder-wood of the Milford police department, the officer testified that after the defendant had come into the police department to tell his side of the story, Calderwood <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>handed the defendant a blue card containing the defendant\u2019s <em>Miranda</em><footnotemark><em>13</em></footnotemark><em> </em>rights. In response to the state\u2019s question, Calderwood testified that the defendant refused to sign and date the <em>Miranda </em>card. The defendant moved to strike the officer\u2019s testimony and the court granted the defendant\u2019s motion, striking both the question and Calderwood\u2019s reply. The court further instructed the jury to \u201cdisregard both the question as well as the answers, if any, and not to speculate on it in any way whatsoever.\u201d The court then excused the jury for the luncheon recess and instructed the state that the information it sought was not relevant and that the question and answer would not be allowed.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-4\">The defendant next asserts that after the luncheon recess, the state resumed its direct examination of Calderwood as to his questions to the defendant. The officer testified that the defendant had informed him that the victim had accepted his luncheon invitation and shortly after he had arrived at the victim\u2019s home they had engaged in consensual sexual relations. Calder-wood then stated that he had twice asked the defendant what the victim was wearing when he arrived at her apartment and the defendant gave two conflicting answers. Calderwood further testified that Detective Steve Fournier, who was also present during the questioning of the defendant, told the defendant that the call the defendant had made to the victim arranging their lunch date may have been recorded, and that the defendant then \u201cstated he had nothing else to say without an attorney present.\u201d The state then asked, \u201cHow would you describe the defendant\u2019s reaction as he was indicating that he didn\u2019t have anything else to say?\u201d Calderwood replied, \u201cHe got a little excited.\u201d The defendant moved to strike the state\u2019s question and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>answer. The court then questioned the state as to what information it was seeking from Calderwood and the state replied, \u201cI am asking the detective upon the defendant\u2019s hearing that the conversation might have been recorded what was his reaction.\u201d The court then overruled the defendant\u2019s motion to strike.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-5\">The defendant argues that the third violation of his rights took place during the state\u2019s second redirect examination of Calderwood when he was asked if the defendant had changed his responses when he had been confronted with a change in circumstances. Calderwood stated that \u201c[tjoward the end of our interview, which was not very long, when Detective Fournier was pressing Mr. Cain about the lunch date over the telephone he really became upset and he stated that he wanted to talk to his attorney and nothing else was said. We terminated our interview.\u201d The defendant noted that \u201cthe state\u2019s last question referred to a change in [the defendant\u2019s] either demeanor or responses with regard to a change in circumstances.\u201d He then moved to strike Calderwood\u2019s statement arguing that evidence of the defendant\u2019s invocation of his constitutional right to an attorney is prohibited under <em>Doyle </em>v. <em>Ohio, </em>426 U.S. 610, 96 S. Ct. 2240, 49 L. Ed. 2d 91 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b540-6\">On appeal, the defendant claims that in these three interviews the state used an effective trial tactic to inform the jury that he had remained silent and had requested counsel when confronted with the possibility that his call to the victim may have been recorded. He also reasserts his claim under <em>Doyle </em>v. <em>Ohio, </em>supra. We conclude that the testimony in this case did not violate the principles set forth in <em>Doyle.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b540-7\"><em>\u201cDoyle </em>v. <em>Ohio </em>proscribes the use for impeachment purposes of a defendant\u2019s silence subsequent to his arrest and after receiving <em>Miranda </em>warnings. \u2018The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>point of the <em>Doyle </em>holding is that it is fundamentally unfair to promise an arrested person that his silence will not be used against him and thereafter to breach that promise by using the silence to impeach his trial testimony.\u2019 \u201d (Emphasis omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Shashaty, </em>205 Conn. 39, 48, 529 A.2d 1308 (1987), cert. denied, 484 U.S. 1027, 108 S. Ct. 753, 98 L. Ed. 2d 766 (1988); quoting <em>Wainwright </em>v. <em>Greenfield, </em>474 U.S. 284, 292, 106 S. Ct. 634, 88 L. Ed. 2d 623 (1986). The state\u2019s reference to a defendant\u2019s assertion of his right to remain silent is not always a constitutional violation. <em>State </em>v. <em>Casey, </em>201 Conn. 174, 182, 513 A.2d 1183 (1986). This evidence may be offered to demonstrate the officers\u2019 investigative effort and the sequence of events as they unfolded. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-4\">The defendant\u2019s argument must fail for two reasons. First, as pointed out by the trial court, the purpose of the state\u2019s questions was to ascertain the defendant\u2019s reaction to the officer\u2019s indication that his phone calls to the victim may have been recorded, and not to elicit his assertion of his right to remain silent for impeachment purposes as required by <em>Doyle. </em>Second, although the evidence of the defendant\u2019s request for counsel was heard by the jury, it was admissible as demonstrative evidence of the officer\u2019s investigative effort, and to show the sequence of events as they unfolded. We conclude that the officer\u2019s testimony was properly admitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-5\">IY</p>\n<p id=\"b541-6\">Sufficiency of the Evidence</p>\n<p id=\"b541-7\">The defendant next claims that there was insufficient evidence to convict him of the crime of burglary in the third degree and harassment.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-8\">Our scope of review on sufficiency of evidence claims is limited to a two part inquiry. <em>State </em>v. <em>Summerville, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>13 Conn. App. 175, 184-85, 535 A.2d 818 (1988). \u201c \u2018We first review the evidence presented at trial, construing it in the light most favorable to sustaining the jury\u2019s verdict. We then determine whether, upon the facts thus established and the inferences reasonably drawn therefrom, the jury could reasonably have concluded that the cumulative effect of the evidence established guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\u2019 . . .\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Simino, </em>200 Conn. 113, 116-17, 509 A.2d 1039 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b542-5\">Our review of the record before us indicates that the evidence in this case overwhelmingly supports the jury\u2019s verdict, and was sufficient to convict the defendant of the crimes charged.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-6\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b542-7\">Jury Charge</p>\n<p id=\"b542-8\">The defendant next claims that the trial court improperly instructed the jury on the question of consent and on the statutory element of the threat of the use of force. He also claims that the court\u2019s instructions on the crime of burglary in the third degree deprived him of a unanimous verdict. We will address each of these assertions individually.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-9\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b542-10\">CONSENT</p>\n<p id=\"b542-11\">The defendant argues that the trial court improperly, instructed the jury on the elements of compulsion required for a conviction of first degree sexual assault. He argues that his own declaration \u201cI don\u2019t know why she is upset, we\u2019ve done it like that before\u201d is sufficient to support his defense of consent. Relying on <em>State </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>210 Conn. 132, 554 A.2d 713 (1989), he contends that this bald assertion was sufficient to have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>shifted the burden to the state to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the victim had not consented. We are unpersuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-5\">First, the very language that the defendant now complains about exactly tracks his request to charge.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> \u201cOrdinarily, action induced by an appellant cannot be a ground for error .... \u2018It seems a bit disingenuous [however] for the defendant to claim that the trial court committed error by instructing the jury . . . when he requested an instruction on that very issue. At least where no constitutional rights are violated,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> when an accused requests in writing that an issue be submitted to the jury, he cannot, on appeal, claim error in its submission . . . .\u201d (Citation omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Turner, </em>24 Conn. App. 264, 272, 587 A.2d 1050 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b543-6\">Further, the defendant\u2019s reliance on <em>State </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>supra, is misplaced. <em>Smith </em>stands for the proposition that \u201ca defendant may not be convicted of . . . [sex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>ual assault in the first degree] if the words or conduct <em>of the complainant </em>under all the circumstances would justify a reasonable belief that she had consented.\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>supra, 141. In addition, sexual assault in the first degree is a crime of general intent. Id., 136. In this context, the defendant\u2019s assertion that he and the victim had participated in this type of sexual relations in the past is irrelevant because whether a complainant has consented to a particular incident of sexual intercourse depends on <em>her manifestation </em>of such consent to <em>that </em>incident as reasonably and objectively construed at <em>that </em>time. Id., 140.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-5\">Thus, our examination of this portion of the court\u2019s charge leads us to conclude that the jury was properly instructed as to the crime of sexual assault in the first degree and on the issue of the victim\u2019s consent.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b544-7\">STATUTORY ELEMENT OF THE THREAT OF THE USE OF FORCE</p>\n<p id=\"b544-8\">The defendant also argues that the trial court\u2019s instruction on sexual assault in the first degree was incomplete because, although the trial court properly explained that it was necessary for the jury to find that the defendant had compelled the victim to engage in sexual intercourse by the use of force or by the threat of the use of force, it did not define the term \u201cthe threat of the use of force.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b544-9\">Initially, we note that the instructions as given by the trial court are once again nearly a mirror image of the defendant\u2019s request to charge. We reiterate that we will not reverse a conviction on the basis of an action that is induced by the appellant unless his constitutional rights have been violated. <em>State </em>v. <em>Turner, </em>supra. In addition, \u201c[d]ue process requires that the state establish beyond a reasonable doubt every essential fact <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>necessary to establish the crime charged .... A court\u2019s charge is not to be examined in a vacuum. Rather, it is to be viewed in the context of the factual issues raised at the trial.\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Kurvin, </em>186 Conn. 555, 558, 442 A.2d 1327 (1982). \u201cIn this case, the [defendant\u2019s] burden is especially heavy because no erroneous instruction was given; his claim of prejudice is based on the failure to give any explanation\u2014beyond the reading of the statutory language itself\u2014of [an essential] element. An omission, or an incomplete instruction, is less likely to be prejudicial than a misstatement of the law.\u201d <em>Henderson </em>v. <em>Kibbe, </em>431 U.S. 145, 155, 97 S. Ct. 1730, 52 L. Ed. 2d 203 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b545-5\">In view of the above, and the fact that the defendant requested the instruction that was given and took no exception to this portion of the charge, we conclude that the trial court\u2019s instruction on the threat of the use of force was proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-6\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b545-7\">UNANIMNITY OF THE VERDICT</p>\n<p id=\"b545-8\">The defendant\u2019s final challenge to the jury charge is that the court\u2019s instructions on burglary in the third degree deprived him of a unanimous verdict in violation of the state and federal constitutions. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-9\">It is axiomatic that an \u201c \u2018appellate court shall not be bound to consider error as to the giving of, or the failure to give, an instruction unless the matter is covered by a written request to charge or an exception has been taken immediately after the charge is delivered by the party appealing.\u2019 \u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Fallwood, </em>193 Conn. 238, 259, 476 A.2d 550 (1984). The purpose of this rule is to alert the trial court to any possible claims arising from its charge while there is still an opportunity for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>correction and for avoidance of an unnecessary retrial. Id. The defendant failed to preserve this claim by either of these available methods.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-5\">In addition, in the present case, the clerk of the trial court specifically inquired as to the jury\u2019s verdict on each individual count, and the trial transcript indicates that the jury foreman responded \u201cguilty\u201d to each count, and that the clerk responded \u201cHe stands charged, and so say you <em>all.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) When this is the case, a defendant who still has any question as to the unanimity of the verdict on any or all counts, still has the opportunity to move to have the jury polled. <em>State </em>v. <em>Anderson, </em>211 Conn. 18, 34, 557 A.2d 917 (1989). The defendant also neglected to take advantage of this third opportunity to preserve this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-6\">Absent the defendant\u2019s objections, we can review his unpreserved claim only under the exceptional circumstances doctrine of <em>State </em>v. <em>Evans, </em>165 Conn. 61, 65-66, 327 A.2d 576 (1973), as reformulated by <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>213 Conn. 233, 567 A.2d 823 (1989); <em>State </em>v. <em>Fullwood, </em>supra. The defendant in this case, however, offers us only an abstract assertion that this unpreserved claim represents a violation of his state and federal constitutional rights without offering us any analysis under either constitution. An issue that is not properly briefed is considered abandoned. <em>State </em>v. <em>Gaines, </em>196 Conn. 395, 397-98 n.2, 493 A.2d 209 (1985). We conclude that the trial court properly instructed the jury on the crime of burglary in the third degree.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-7\">VI</p>\n<p id=\"b546-8\">Admission of State\u2019s Exhibit</p>\n<p id=\"b546-9\">The defendant\u2019s final claim is that the trial court should not have admitted state\u2019s exhibit E, the victim\u2019s phone log recording her phone calls on February 16, 17, and 18, 1988, because the defendant was acquitted of the related harassment charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>The following facts are relevant to the resolution of this claim. At the close of the state\u2019s case, the defendant\u2019s motion for judgment of acquittal was granted by the trial court as to the harassment charges that stemmed from the defendant\u2019s February 16, 17, and 18, 1988 telephone calls to the defendant. The trial court ruled in favor of the defendant after it held that the state had not proven the identity of the caller beyond a reasonable doubt. The trial court then struck the testimony of Eugene Bachman, a representative of the Southern New England Telephone Company, who had testified as to the telephone trap that traced the February 17 and 18 phone calls to the defendant\u2019s business telephone. The court also struck the exhibits that had been introduced by Bachman and all testimony that related to the February harassment charges. At that time, the court refused to strike Fournier\u2019s testimony as to the February calls because it found that these calls related to the harassment charge that was still pending stemming from the defendant\u2019s June 21, 1988 phone call. After the closing arguments, the court refused to strike exhibit E, which had come in without objection, because it found that these phone calls were never specifically tied to the defendant, but did go to the victim\u2019s state of mind when she received the June 21,1988 telephone call from the defendant at her health club.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-5\">\u201cEvidence is only admissible when it tends to establish a fact in issue or to corroborate other direct evidence in a case.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Robinson, </em>213 Conn. 243, 259, 567 A.2d 1173 (1989). The harassment charges that stemmed from the defendant\u2019s June 21,1988 phone call to the victim\u2019s health spa required proof of the victim\u2019s state of mind, in that it was essential for the state to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant\u2019s actions were \u201clikely to cause annoyance or alarm\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>in order to convict the defendant of harassment. The trial court properly denied the defendant\u2019s motion to strike state\u2019s exhibit E.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-5\">The judgment is affirmed. '</p>\n<p id=\"b548-6\">In this opinion Norcott, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b527-7\"> The state\u2019s charging document cites a violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-183 (3). This appears to be a scrivner\u2019s error, in that the only portion of \u00a7 53a-183 that carries a subdivision (3) is \u00a7 53a-183 (a) (3). This conclusion is further supported by the fact that the text of the substitute information tracks the wording of \u00a7 53a-183 (a) (3), in that it reads: \u201con or about the 21st day of June 1988, the said Anthony W.

I conclude that the trial court should have granted the defendant\u2019s motion to strike the victim\u2019s testimony because the missing 911 statement implicated the defendant's federal constitutional right to confront and cross-examine a critical witness. The majority\u2019s opinion has failed to consider the factors the Connecticut Supreme Court has articulated and applied in similar cases to assess whether the missing 911 statement infringed on the defendant\u2019s confrontation rights. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Belle, </em>215 Conn. 257, 269-70, 576 A.2d 139 (1990) ; <em>State </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>214 Conn. 161, 174-75, 571 A.2d 79 (1990); <em>State </em>v. <em>Williamson, </em>212 Conn. 6, 22-23, 562 A.2d 470 (1989) <em>(Williamson II); State </em>v. <em>Sanford, </em>25 Conn. App. 255, 260-61, 594 A.2d 477 (1991) . First, it must be determined whether \u201cthe trial court or a reviewing court ha[d] access to the unproduced material.\u201d <em>WilliamsonII, </em>supra, 22. As in <em>Williamson II, </em>neither the trial court nor this court has had access to the victim\u2019s 911 statement because it was destroyed. As in <em>Williamson II, </em>neither the trial court nor this court has had a counterpart transcript of the missing statement, read and adopted by the victim shortly after making her 911 telephone call. Id., 23. Finally, like the <em>Williamson II </em>case, the defendant\u2019s conviction obviously rested on the testimony of the victim, whose pretrial statement was destroyed. Id., 22-23. Given these factors, the defendant\u2019s right to confront and cross-examine the victim was implicated and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>the state should have been held to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the missing 911 statement was harmless. Id., 23.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b549-5\">From the evidence adduced at trial, the state could not prove that the missing 911 statement was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. The defendant\u2019s conviction rested squarely on the victim\u2019s testimony in this case and her testimony contained critical inconsistencies. On direct examination, the victim testified that the first person she called after the incident was her friend. The victim claimed that she told her friend that the defendant had assaulted her. She then testified that after this conversation she called 911 and reported: \u201cI was raped.\u201d During her cross-examination, the victim testified that she told her friend, \u201c[the defendant] raped me,\u201d not \u201c[the defendant] hit me,\u201d as her friend had testified. She then explained that in her prior testimony she had used the word \u201cassaulted\u201d because she was afraid to use the term \u201crape,\u201d and that she had, in fact, told her friend that she was raped. During recross, the victim reaffirmed the sequence of her telephone calls and that she had reported to the 911 operator that she had been raped. The victim\u2019s friend testified that the victim called and said \u201c[the defendant] hit me,\u201d but she was not certain of the wording, and later testified that it sounded like \u201c[the defendant] hit me.\u201d The state submitted into evidence the victim\u2019s statement to the police on the day she called 911. The statement contained the victim\u2019s accusation that the defendant had raped her on that day.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>The inconsistencies in the victim\u2019s testimony and in what she said to her friend on the phone are relevant to the issue of what was the victim\u2019s initial complaint to the police on that day. Although the inconsistencies have to do with what the victim told her friend about her complaint, they do indicate that the victim\u2019s call to the police, which immediately followed, was of critical importance. What the victim reported in her 911 statement would either support her accusation of rape or provide the defendant with material for further impeachment because she could have complained of an assault or of the defendant\u2019s striking her. Conceivably, the victim and the defendant could have had consensual intercourse and subsequently had a violent altercation. Simply because there may have been a temporal juxtaposition between the sexual intercourse and an assault does not lead to the inescapable conclusion that a rape occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-5\">The trial court\u2019s conclusion that the defendant had not been prejudiced was based on its speculation that the 911 tape contained the victim\u2019s accusation that she had been raped.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> This speculation is unfounded and did not address the inference of inconsistency drawn from both the victim\u2019s and her friend\u2019s testimony. Though her 911 statement may have been brief, as the facts of this case demonstrate, whether the victim reported that she had been struck, assaulted or raped would have been critical evidence for the defendant\u2019s defense and thus implicated his confrontation rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-6\">The defendant was able thoroughly to cross-examine the witnesses and did expose the jury to the inconsistencies contained in the victim\u2019s testimony and in her conversation with her friend. See <em>Williamson II, </em>supra, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>25-26. This does not ameliorate, however, the prejudice the defendant may have suffered because he did not have available the victim\u2019s 911 statement. See id. Had the jury heard that the victim reported to the police that the defendant had struck her or assaulted her, and not that he had raped her, it might have affected the outcome of this case, at least regarding the counts of sexual assault and burglary. Thus, the trial court should have stricken the victim\u2019s testimony because of the state\u2019s failure to produce the 911 statement and the state\u2019s subsequent failure to prove the defendant had not been prejudiced beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-4\">As a result of this conclusion, I would reverse the judgment of conviction on the counts of sexual assault and burglary and remand the case for a new trial on those counts. In all other aspects of the majority\u2019s opinion I concur.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b549-6\"> The trial court rendered its decision on the defendant\u2019s motion to strike before the Connecticut Supreme Court affirmed <em>State </em>v. <em>Williamson, </em>14 Conn.

Thus, the trial court did not have the guidance of <em>Williamson II </em>in deciding the issue of prejudice.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b550-7\"> A court may not speculate about what a missing statement contains or how the defendant would have used this unproduced statement in his defense. <em>State </em>v. <em>Williamson, </em>212 Conn. 6, 22-23, 562 A.2d 470 (1989).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
