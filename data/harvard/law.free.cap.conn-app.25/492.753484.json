We hold that although there was no material fact in issue, the defendant was not entitled to judgment as a matter of law, and, therefore, the court\u2019s judgment must be reversed.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b515-7\">The plaintiff was a police officer employed by the defendant. He was injured in the course of his employment when the police car he was operating was involved in a collision with another car. He received workers\u2019 compensation benefits and $20,000 from the other driver\u2019s insurance carrier, which was the limit of the policy. The plaintiff\u2019s economic and medical damages allegedly exceeded $20,000. Claiming that the compensable value of his injuries exceeded the amount of coverage available from the other driver\u2019s insurance policy, the plaintiff sought the monetary difference between the two amounts from the defendant, as underinsured motorist benefits. The defendant was self-insured for automobile liability coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-8\">The issue to be decided is whether the defendant is obligated to provide uninsured or underinsured motorist benefits, as well as workers\u2019 compensation benefits, to an employee injured during the course of his employ<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>ment notwithstanding General Statutes \u00a7 31-284.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Section 31-284 provides that the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act is the exclusive remedy for claims of an employee against an employer, except if the employee has secured additional benefits by agreement with the employer. The plaintiff claims that he is entitled to uninsured motorist coverage pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 38a-336 (a) (2) (formerly \u00a7 38-175c [a] [2]), the uninsured motorist statute.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The defendant argues that it is exempt from paying the plaintiff underinsured motorist benefits, not because it is a self-insurer but because the plaintiff has received workers\u2019 compensation benefits as a result of the accident, which is the exclusive source of his benefits from the defendant, except as otherwise agreed. The defendant argues that any conflict between the uninsured motorist benefits coverage and the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act must be resolved in favor of the exclusivity provision of the latter. The defendant also claims that police patrol cars are not within the statutory category of vehicles that must have uninsured motorist coverage and that, therefore, the plaintiff is not entitled to compensation beyond his workers\u2019 compensation benefits.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b517-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>We addressed the same issue in <em>Ross </em>v. <em>New Haven, </em>19 Conn. App. 169, 561 A.2d 457, cert. granted, 212 Conn. 814, 565 A.2d 536 (1989).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In <em>Ross, </em>we held that the exclusive remedy provision of General Statutes \u00a7 31-284 bars an employee from seeking uninsured motorist benefits from his self-insured employer after having already received workers\u2019 compensation benefits, in the absence of an agreement with the employer for additional benefits. We conclude that <em>Ross </em>has been effectively overruled by <em>Wilson </em>v. <em>Security Ins. Co., </em>213 Conn. 532, 569 A.2d 40, cert. denied, U.S. , 111 S. Ct. 52, 112 L. Ed. 2d 28 (1990).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b517-5\">We further conclude that a self-insured entity, in its capacity as an employer, is required to provide workers\u2019 compensation benefits, and, as an insurer, is required to provide uninsured motorist benefits. An employee\u2019s receipt of workers\u2019 compensation benefits from a self-insured employer does not, therefore, preclude his right to receive uninsured motorist benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-6\">A review of the purposes and policies underlying workers\u2019 compensation benefits and uninsured motorist benefits indicates that they exist for separate and distinct reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-7\">\u201c \u2018The purpose of the workmen\u2019s compensation statute is to compensate the worker for injuries arising out of and in the course of employment, without regard to fault, by imposing a form of strict liability on the employer.\u2019 <em>Jett </em>v. <em>Dunlap, </em>179 Conn. 215, 217, 425 A.2d 1263 (1979). The Workers\u2019 Compensation Act \u2018com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>promise[s] an employee\u2019s right to a common law <em>tort action </em>for work related injuries in return for relatively quick and certain compensation.\u2019 <em>Mingachos </em>v. <em>CBS, Inc., </em>196 Conn. 91, 97, 491 A.2d 368 (1985); see also 81 Am.

It is undisputed that the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, General Statutes \u00a7 31-275 et seq., is the exclusive remedy for injuries sustained by an employee \u201carising out of and in the course of his employment.\u201d Except as provided by statute, all rights and claims between employers and employees, or their representatives or dependents, arising out of personal injury or death sustained in the course of employment are abolished. <em>Wesson </em>v. <em>Milford, </em>5 Conn.

Co., </em>5 Conn. App. 179, 182, 497 A.2d 1001 (1985). Uninsured motorist insurance covers the insured who is injured by an uninsured motorist. Every residual automobile liability policy must provide uninsured motorist coverage pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 38a-336. General Statutes \u00a7 38a-370 (b) (formerly \u00a7 38-326 [b]).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The purpose of this insurance is to give <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>the injured party the same protection as if he had been injured by an insured motorist. <em>Harvey </em>v. <em>Travelers Indemnity Co., </em>188 Conn. 245, 249, 449 A.2d 157 (1982); 7 Am. Jur. 2d \u00a7 293. Under such a policy, an insurer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>pays the insured the amount that he is legally entitled to recover from the uninsured motorist. General Statutes \u00a7 38a-336; Regs., Conn. State Agencies \u00a7 38-175a-6 (a);<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <em>Harvey </em>v. <em>Travelers Indemnity Co., </em>supra, 247.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-5\">General Statutes (Rev. to 1985) \u00a7 38-327 (c) (1) (now \u00a7 38a-371) permits self-insurance provided a self-insurer files a form to continue to undertake \u201cto pay basic reparations benefits and the liabilities covered by residual liability insurance and to perform all other obligations imposed by this chapter. . . .\u201d Section \u00a7 38a-370 (b) provides that \u201c[rjesidual liability insurance shall afford coverage which satisfies the requirements of sections <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>38a-334 to 38a-336, 38a-338, and 38a-340 to 38a-343, inclusive.\u201d Section 38a-336 requires that automobile liability insurance policies must provide uninsured motorist coverage. Accordingly, self-insurers are required to provide uninsured motorist coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-5\">Except for the fact that the defendant is self-insured, the facts in <em>Wilson </em>v. <em>Security Ins. Co., </em>supra, are identical to the facts in the case before us. <em>Wilson </em>involved a Woodbridge police officer who was injured by a hit and run driver while on duty. The defendant insurance company had in force a business automobile liability policy insuring vehicles owned by the town of Wood-bridge. Id., 533-34. Although the principal issue involved whether the uninsured motorist coverage could be stacked, on cross appeal the plaintiff raised the issue of the relationship between uninsured motorist benefits and workers\u2019 compensation benefits. Id., 533, 536.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-6\">In his cross appeal, the plaintiff argued that his damages were for pain, suffering, disability, and loss of earning capacity, none of which is recoverable under the workers\u2019 compensation laws. He, therefore, asserted that his damages had not been paid and, thus, no reduction in uninsured motorist coverage was required under \u00a7 38-175a-6 (d) of the Regulations of Connecticut State Agencies.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> <em>Wilson </em>v. <em>Security Ins. Co., </em>supra, 537. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>Because the court found that \u00a7 38-175a-6 (d) did not quantify the kinds of damages that must be paid before a reduction could occur, it concluded that \u201c[i]f damages are paid pursuant to the workers\u2019 compensation law, the uninsured motorist coverage may be reduced accordingly. General Statutes \u00a7 [38a-336] contains no mandate that uninsured motorist coverage benefits may not be reduced.\u201d Id., 538. Therefore, the amount received under uninsured motorist coverage may be reduced by the amount paid or payable under workers\u2019 compensation. Thus, the receipt of workers\u2019 compensation benefits does not preclude the receipt of uninsured motorist benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-5\">The defendant acknowledged in its brief that \u201c[i]t seems clear from the Connecticut General Statutes that self-insurers, like the City, are required to provide uninsured motorist benefits. As is asserted by the appellant, Conn. General Statute Section [38a-370 (b)] unambiguously requires that residual liability insurance satisfy the requirements of Section [38a-334] <em>et seq, </em>which includes provisions concerning uninsured motorist coverage. However a police patrol car does not fall within the statutory category of vehicles which require uninsured motorist coverage pursuant to Section [38a-334], [38a-363 (g)] and 14-1 of the Connecticut General Statutes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b522-6\">In <em>Christy </em>v. <em>Newark, </em>102 N. J. 598, 510 A.2d 22 (N. J. 1986), a police officer was injured when a hit and run vehicle struck his police car, and he sought uninsured motorist benefits from his employer, a self-insured municipality, in addition to his workers\u2019 compensation benefits. The New Jersey Supreme Court concluded <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>that a self-insured municipality was obligated by statute to provide uninsured motorist benefits and that the employee\u2019s receipt of workers\u2019 compensation benefits from the municipality did not preclude receipt of uninsured motorist benefits. The court reached this conclusion by distinguishing between an action in tort and an action in contract. In reaching its conclusion, the <em>Christy </em>court noted that the purpose of workers\u2019 compensation in New Jersey is to prohibit an employee from suing an employer in negligence and that suits against third party tortfeasors are preserved. Id., 609. Of particular import was the fact that recovery from a third party does not result in double recovery for the same injury because the employer is entitled to a credit or reimbursement for damages paid to the employee. Id., 609-10. The <em>Christy </em>court also specifically determined that the claim for uninsured motorist benefits arises out of a contract created by the statutory obligation to furnish such benefits. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-5\">In <em>Heavens </em>v. <em>Laclede Gas Co., </em>755 S.W.2d 331 (Mo. App. 1988) the Missouri Court of Appeals concluded that a self-insured employer is required by statute to provide uninsured motorist coverage to an employee injured by an uninsured motorist in the course of employment. Id., 332. The court distinguished between the defendant as employer and the defendant as insurer and specifically noted that had the defendant purchased insurance rather than self-insuring, the insurer would have paid the employee under the uninsured motorist provision of the policy. Id. The court, therefore, focused on whether a self-insurer is statutorily required to provide uninsured motorist benefits. Answering this question affirmatively, the court commented that it would be \u201cunconscionable to allow an employer to totally avoid providing employees with uninsured motorist coverage by choosing to be self-insured.\u201d Id., 333.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>Similarly, the purpose of the worker\u2019s compensation law in this state is to provide the exclusive tort remedy for an employee against an employer. See <em>Panaro </em>v. <em>Electrolux Corporation, </em>supra, 599; <em>Mingachos </em>v. <em>CBS, Inc., </em>supra. Just as the Missouri court found in <em>Heavens, </em>self-insurers in Connecticut are statutorily required to provide uninsured motorist coverage pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 38a-371 (formerly 38-327) and 38a-370 (b). As the New Jersey court found in <em>Christy, </em>our laws permit Connecticut employers \u201chaving paid, or having become obligated to pay, compensation\u201d to bring an action against a third party, with a legal liability to pay damages for an employee\u2019s injury, to recover any amount paid or which it has become obligated to pay. General Statutes \u00a7 31-293; <em>Enquist </em>v. <em>General Datacom, </em>218 Conn. 19, 22-23, 587 A.2d 1029 (1991); <em>Skitromo </em>v. <em>Meriden Yellow Cab Co., </em>204 Conn. 485, 488, 528 A.2d 826 (1987). In addition, our Supreme Court in <em>Wilson </em>has recently affirmed the legality of the reduction to uninsured motorist benefits by the amount paid or payable under workers\u2019 compensation pursuant to \u00a7 38-175a-6 (d) of the Regulations of Connecticut State Agencies. In doing so, the court has recognized the legality of an employee\u2019s receipt of both workers\u2019 compensation benefits and uninsured motorist benefits. Thus, a self-insured employer is required to provide workers\u2019 compensation benefits and uninsured motorist coverage. Therefore, an injured employee of a self-insured employer is entitled to receive the same benefits as an employee of an employer that is not self-insured.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-5\">The judgment is reversed and the case is remanded for further proceedings.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b515-9\"> The defendants are the city of Norwich police department and the municipality of Norwich.
