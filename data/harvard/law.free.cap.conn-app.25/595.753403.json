On October 21, 1988, the trial court, <em>Noren, J., </em>ordered a dissolution of the parties\u2019 marriage and bifurcated the matter for a hearing on the support and division of property issues, which proceeded on January 6, 1989. Prior to rendering a judgment Judge Noren died. By stipulation of the parties, the matter was submitted for decision on the rec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>ord to the court, <em>Koletsky, J., </em>who rendered judgment on September 5, 1990.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The child support guidelines were not brought to the attention of the trial court, nor were they sought to be applied.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-5\">The parties had been married for nineteen years and had two children. The plaintiff had remained at home while the children were young and subsequently became employed, first in the defendant\u2019s family market and later in a clothing store. Her employment was interrupted due to both physical and emotional difficulties related to the separation. The defendant owned and operated his own corporation, which was suffering financial difficulties at the time of the first hearing. At the time of the hearings, the plaintiff was earning $150 per week and the defendant was earning $500 per week. The parties\u2019 assets consisted primarily of the marital home and the defendant\u2019s family business.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-6\">Our standard of review is well settled. We will not substitute our judgment for that of the trial court unless there has been an abuse of discretion or the findings lack a reasonable basis in fact. <em>Paddock </em>v. <em>Paddock, </em>22 Conn. App. 367, 372, 577 A.2d 1087 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b621-7\">As to the first five issues, the trial court stated that it had considered all of the factors enumerated in General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 46b-81, 46b-82 and 46b-84 in making its decision. The memorandum of decision clearly indicates that the trial court considered all of the statutory factors. We conclude, therefore, that there was no abuse of discretion in the judgment as to either the distribution of assets, assignment of debts or the payment of the plaintiff\u2019s counsel fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-8\">General Statutes \u00a7 46b-215b, effective October 1, 1989, created a rebuttable presumption that when the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>amount for child support is determined in accordance with the child support guidelines, an order reflecting that amount is appropriate. A specific finding on the record that the application of the guidelines would be inequitable or inappropriate is sufficient to rebut that presumption. In this case, the evidentiary hearing concluded on January 6, 1989, prior to the promulgation of the guidelines, although the decision was not rendered until September 5, 1990.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-5\">We conclude that the guidelines were not applicable here because all of the evidence in this case was admitted prior to the effective date of the guidelines and because Judge Koletsky ruled on the basis of that evidence and, presumably, on the basis of the law as it existed as of the date of the hearings before Judge Noren. Given the evidentiary requirements of the guidelines and the unique circumstances of this case, we hold that it was proper for the defendant\u2019s support obligation to be determined as of the last day of the hearings and without reference to the child support guidelines.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-6\">In <em>Turner </em>v. <em>Turner, </em>219 Conn. 703, 595 A.2d 297 (1991), our Supreme Court held that General Statutes \u00a7 46b-86 (a), as amended by Public Acts 1990, No. 90-188,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> applies retroactively in some instances. <em>Turner, </em>however, is inapposite here. The case here does not involve an existing child support order that the defendant has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>moved to modify based on a substantial deviation from the child support guidelines. There is, thus, no time period during which a motion for modification was pending that could be retroactively modified. Retroactive modification of a child support order, as discussed by the <em>Turner </em>court, is, therefore, not an issue here.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-6\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b621-9\"> In light of the parties\u2019 stipulation, Judge Koletsky did not hear additional evidence but rather rendered judgment, based on the record as of January 6,1989, as if it had been rendered by Judge Noren before his death.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b622-7\"> As amended by Public Acts 1990, No. 90-188 \u00a7 1, General Statutes \u00a7 46b-86 (a) provides in pertinent part: \u201c[A]ny final order for . . . support . . . may at any time thereafter be ... . modified .... upon a showing that the final order for child support substantially deviates from the child support guidelines . . . unless there was a specific finding on the record that the application of the guidelines would be inequitable or inappropriate. ...
