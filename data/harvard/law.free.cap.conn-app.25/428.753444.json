The dispositive issue in this case is whether, under the Connecticut constitution, the question of probable cause is to be determined by the totality of the circumstances analysis set out in <em>Illinois </em>v. <em>Gates, </em>462 U.S. 213, 103 S. Ct. 2317, 76 L. Ed. 2d 527 (1983), or by the stricter two-pronged test of the Aguilar-Spinelli<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> cases as previously adopted by our Supreme Court in <em>State </em>v. <em>Kimbro, </em>197 Conn. 219, 496 A.2d 498 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b451-8\">The following facts are relevant to our discussion of this issue. On June 24, 1989, New Haven police officers searched the defendant\u2019s Sheffield Avenue apartment pursuant to a search warrant that had been issued in connection with their investigation of a series of burglaries that had taken place in the city\u2019s Prospect <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>Street section. In the affidavit that was attached to the warrant Detective Mel Cartoceti and Officer Edwin Ingraham stated that a \u201cknown and reliable informant\u201d had named the defendant as one of two individuals that were burglarizing homes in the Prospect Street area. Police seized several items from the defendant\u2019s apartment that were connected with two of the burglaries, and the defendant was subsequently arrested and charged with two counts of burglary in the first degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 52a-101 (a) (2), two counts of robbery in the second degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-135 (a) (1) and two counts of kidnapping in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-92 (a) (2) (B).</p>\n<p id=\"b452-5\">On December 12,1989, the defendant filed a motion to suppress the items seized from his apartment. At the hearing on the motion, the state conceded that the warrant and supporting affidavit did not meet the requirements of <em>Aguilar-Spinelli, </em>but argued instead that the warrant should be upheld because the officers executing it relied in good faith on the judge\u2019s endorsement. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Leon, </em>468 U.S. 897, 104 S. Ct. 3405, 82 L. Ed. 2d 677 (1984). The trial court agreed, and the defendant subsequently entered pleas of nolo contendere to four of the counts conditioned on the reservation of his right to appeal the trial court\u2019s denial of his motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-6\">The defendant instituted this appeal on March 23, 1990, initially claiming that the trial court improperly found a good faith exception to the exclusionary rule under the Connecticut constitution. After the defendant had filed his brief, our Supreme Court decided this issue in <em>State </em>v. <em>Marsala, </em>216 Conn. 150, 151, 579 A.2d 58 (1990), holding that \u201ca \u2018good faith\u2019 exception to the exclusionary rule is incompatible with the constitution <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>of Connecticut . . . .\u201d Accordingly, on September 19, 1990, this court allowed the state to file a statement of alternative grounds. Practice Book \u00a7 4013 (a) (1). In its statement, the state asserts, in pertinent part, that (1) the <em>Gates </em>totality of the circumstances test should be used to determine probable cause for the issuance of a warrant in all cases where the warrant is based on informant information and, alternatively, (2) the <em>Gates </em>test should be used at least in those cases where an informant\u2019s tip is not the basis for initiating a police investigation but instead is used to identify suspects and corroborate facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-5\">Our decision in this case is controlled by our Supreme Court\u2019s recent rulings in <em>State </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>219 Conn. 557, 594 A.2d 933 (1991), and <em>State </em>v. <em>Barton, </em>219 Conn. 529, 594 A.2d 917 (1991). In those cases, the court overruled its previous holding in <em>Kimbro </em>and found that \u201cthe \u2018totality of the circumstances\u2019 analysis adopted in <em>Gates </em>will continue to guarantee the people of Connecticut \u2018the full panoply of rights\u2019 that they have come to expect as their due.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Barton, </em>supra, 546. \u201cUnder that analysis, the task of a magistrate in determining the existence of probable cause to search is to make a practical, nontechnical decision whether, given all the circumstances set forth in the warrant affidavit, including the \u2018veracity\u2019 and the \u2018basis of knowledge\u2019 of persons supplying hearsay information, there is a fair probability that contraband or evidence of a crime will be found in a particular place. <em>State </em>v. <em>Barton, </em>supra, 552. When an affidavit indicates that the police have relied on information from a confidential informant, \u2018the magistrate should examine the affidavit to determine whether it adequately describes both the factual basis of the informant\u2019s knowledge and the basis on which the police have determined that the information is reliable. If the warrant affidavit fails to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>state in specific terms how the informant gained his knowledge or why the police believe the information to be trustworthy, however, the magistrate can also consider all the circumstances set forth in the affidavit to determine whether, despite these deficiencies, other objective indicia of reliability reasonably establish that probable cause to search exists. In making this determination, the magistrate is entitled to draw reasonable inferences from the facts presented.\u2019 Id., 544.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>supra, 563.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-5\">We must now consider the affidavit presented in this case in light of these standards.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The affidavit stated that Sergeant William White of the New Haven police department had learned from a \u201cknown and reliable informant\u201d that the defendant was one of two black males who had taken part in a series of burglaries that the department was investigating. The informant told White that the burglaries had taken place in the Prospect Street section of New Haven and that the burglars had used gloves and masks and had taken jewelry and in one instance a television set. According to the affidavit, this information was in agreement with what the police had already learned in the course of their investigation of the burglaries. The affidavit also stated that the informant gave White the second burglar\u2019s address and told him that the man lived with a woman named Priscilla and that he may have sold some of the stolen items to the Reverend Kimber of the Pitts Chapel. A check with United Illuminating Company confirmed that Priscilla Langley was receiving electric services at the address given by the informant. The New Haven police records also showed that a domestic dispute had been reported at that address between the second man <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>named by the informant and his girl friend, Priscilla Langley. Finally, although Kimber denied having bought any items from the second man named, he admitted that he knew the man and told the police that the man had worked for him as a maintenance worker but had recently been released from the job because of problems.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-5\">It is clear that the affidavit at issue in this case did not expressly state the informant\u2019s basis of knowledge or the basis on which the police believed the informant to be reliable. It did, however, provide a substantial basis for the trial court to infer that the informant\u2019s information was reliable. The affidavit stated that each piece of information given by the informant either confirmed what was already known by the police or was subsequently confirmed by the police. We accordingly affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-7\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b451-9\"> <em>Aguilar </em>v. <em>Texas, </em>378 U.S. 108, 84 S.
