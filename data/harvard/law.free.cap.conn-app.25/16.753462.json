The plaintiffs challenge the trial court\u2019s finding that there was insufficient evidence to establish probable cause that the defendant had acted with malice in fact. The defendant has cross appealed, claiming that the trial court improperly determined that her challenged statement (1) was not protected by the constitutional guarantee of free speech and (2) accused the plaintiffs of dealing drugs.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-5\">The trial court could reasonably have found the following facts. On August 10, 1989, the defendant sent a letter to Carol Herskowitz, first selectperson for the town of Southbury. In her letter, the defendant complained of government inaction with respect to garbage pickup and the enforcement of zoning laws near Patty\u2019s Pantry. She also stated that \u201c[m]any locals freely admit with a shrug that Patty\u2019s Pantry is the local spot to get your drugs since everyone going in and out makes it difficult to monitor. . . . It\u2019s supposed to be a convenience store, but I don\u2019t think that the availability of drugs within a block of the high school is what the term \u2018convenience store\u2019 is supposed to mean.\u201d The defendant sent a copy of this letter to Voices, a local newspaper, which published the letter on its \u201cLetters to the Editor\u201d page on August 16, 1989.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-6\">The plaintiffs brought this libel action in two counts by a complaint dated August 21,1989. On August 22, 1989, the plaintiffs obtained an ex parte prejudgment remedy to attach the defendant\u2019s real property at 151 Reservoir Road, Southbury, in the amount of $150,000. The defendant moved to modify or dissolve the prejudgment attachment on October 13,1989.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The trial court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>held a hearing at which it received evidence and heard testimony from both of the plaintiffs and from the defendant. The court concluded that the plaintiffs had failed to meet their burden of showing probable cause that the defendant had acted with malice in .fact, thus limiting their recovery to actual damages.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The court therefore reduced the plaintiffs\u2019 prejudgment attachment to $7500. In an articulation filed on July 2,1990, the court, citing <em>Moore </em>v. <em>Stevenson, </em>27 Conn. 14 (1858), defined malice in fact as \u201cimproper or unjustifiable motives indicative of ill will or an intent or desire to injure.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b40-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b40-6\">The Appeal</p>\n<p id=\"b40-7\">The plaintiffs claim, in essence, that the trial court improperly defined malice in fact in terms of \u201cill will or an intent or desire to injure.\u201d We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-8\">In acting on a prejudgment remedy motion, the trial court \u201c \u2018must evaluate the arguments and evidence produced by both parties\u201d to determine whether there is probable cause to sustain the validity of the plaintiffs\u2019 claim. <em>Augeri </em>v. <em>C. F. Wooding Co., </em>173 Conn. 426, 429, 378 A.2d 538 (1977); <em>L. Suzio Concrete Co. </em>v. <em>Salafia, </em>3 Conn. App. 404, 488 A.2d 1280 (1985); General Statutes \u00a7 52-278d (a). The court should not, however, make a full and final decision on the plaintiffs\u2019 claim, as \u201c[t]he hearing in probable cause for the issuance of a prejudg<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>ment remedy is not contemplated to be a full scale trial on the merits . . . <em>Three S. Development Co. </em>v. <em>Santore, </em>193 Conn. 174, 175, 474 A.2d 795 (1984); <em>Augeri </em>v. <em>C. F. Wooding Co., </em>supra. Instead, the trial court, vested with broad discretion, need determine only the likely success of the plaintiffs\u2019 claim by weighing probabilities. <em>Three S. Development Co. </em>v. <em>Santore, </em>supra, 176.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-6\">This court\u2019s role in reviewing the trial court\u2019s ruling on a prejudgment remedy motion is limited. \u201cIt is not to duplicate the trial court\u2019s weighing process, but rather to determine whether its conclusion was reasonable. Tn the absence of clear error, this court should not overrule the thoughtful decision of the trial court, which has had an opportunity to assess the legal issues which may be raised and to weigh the credibility of at least some of the witnesses.\u2019 <em>[Augeri </em>v. <em>C. F. Wooding Co., </em>supra, 429.]\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-7\">The trial court in this case clearly used an improper standard to find that there was no probable cause that the defendant had acted with malice in fact. Since 1858, Connecticut courts have defined malice in fact as any improper or unjustifiable motive. <em>Bleich </em>v. <em>Ortiz, </em>196 Conn. 498, 504, 493 A.2d 236 (1985); <em>Proto </em>v. <em>Bridgeport Herald Corporation, </em>136 Conn. 557, 564, 72 A.2d 820 (1950); <em>Corsello </em>v. <em>Emerson Bros., Inc., </em>106 Conn. 127, 132, 137 A. 390 (1927); <em>Hassett </em>v. <em>Carroll, </em>85 Conn. 23, 37, 81 A. 1013 (1911); <em>Wynne </em>v. <em>Parsons, </em>57 Conn. 73, 80, 17 A. 362 (1889); <em>Hotchkiss </em>v. <em>Porter, </em>30 Conn. 414, 421 (1862); <em>Moore </em>v. <em>Stevenson, </em>supra, 28. Malice in fact has never been construed to require proof of \u201cpersonal pique, ill will [or] hatred\u201d on the part of a perpetrator of a libel. <em>Moore </em>v. <em>Stevenson, </em>supra, 27. It can also be proved by \u201cconduct evincive of similar feelings or motives, as if the publication was at the time known to be false, or made without authority, or such authority as would be regarded as entitled to credence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>among upright and careful men, or manifesting an entire indifference whether the charge is true or false . . . . \u201d Id., 28-29. The trial court in this case, therefore, clearly erred when it limited its definition of malice in fact to acts indicative of \u201cill will or an intent or desire to injure.\u201d Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the trial court and remand the case for a new hearing on the defendant\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b42-6\">The Cross Appeal</p>\n<p id=\"b42-7\">In her cross appeal, the defendant claims that the trial court improperly found that her challenged statement (1) was not protected by the constitutional guarantee of free speech regarding fair comment on a matter of public concern and (2) accused the plaintiffs individually and personally of dealing drugs. Although we are remanding the case on the plaintiffs\u2019 appeal, we address these issues because they may recur on rehearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-8\">As noted above, the trial court, ruling on a prejudgment remedy motion, is vested with broad discretion in determining the probable success of the plaintiffs\u2019 claim. <em>Three S. Development Co. </em>v. <em>Santore, </em>supra, 176. In so doing, the court must evaluate not only the plaintiffs\u2019 claim but also any defenses raised by the defendant. <em>Augeri </em>v. <em>C. F. Wooding Co., </em>supra, 429. This is because \u201ca good defense . . . will be enough to show that there is no \u2018probable cause that judgment will be rendered in the matter in favor of the plaintiff.\u2019 \u201d Id. We will reverse the trial court\u2019s decision on a prejudgment remedy motion only in cases of clear error. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-9\">The trial court in this case properly considered both the plaintiffs\u2019 claim and the defenses presented in weighing the probability that the plaintiffs\u2019 claim would succeed. We find that the court\u2019s evaluation of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>defendant\u2019s arguments was not clearly erroneous and therefore affirm the judgment of the trial court on the defendant\u2019s cross appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-5\">The judgment of the trial court is reversed as to the issue raised on the appeal and the case is remanded for a new hearing in accordance with this opinion. The judgment of the trial court is affirmed as to the issues raised on the cross appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-6\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b39-7\"> In her motion, the defendant requested only that the prejudgment attachment be dissolved. She was allowed orally to amend her motion after the hearing to seek, in the alternative, a modification.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b40-9\"> General Statutes \u00a7 52-237 provides: \u201cIn any action for a libel the defendant may give proof of intention; and unless the plaintiff proves either malice in fact or that the defendant, after having been requested by him in writing to retract the libelous charge, in as public a manner as that in which it was made, failed to do so within a reasonable time, he shall recover nothing but such actual damage as he may have specially alleged and proved.\u201d It is undisputed that in this case the plaintiffs not only failed to request a retraction but in fact refused the defendant\u2019s offer to have a retraction published. Therefore, under this statute, the plaintiffs must prove that the defendant acted with malice in fact to recover general damages.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
