Erene appealed to the District <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>Court, which affirmed the MPERB\u2019s order. Erene now appeals the District Court\u2019s order. We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-4\">\u00b62 We consider the following issues on appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b176-5\">\u00b63 <em>1. Did Erene\u2019s application for and acceptance of benefits on behalf of the children render her claim moot or waive her right to challenge the beneficiary designation?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b176-7\">\u00b64 <em>2. Does a temporary restraining order issued in a marital dissolution proceeding under \u00a7 40-4-121(3), MCA, apply to the designation of a beneficiary under the Sheriffs\u2019 Retirement System ?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b176-8\">PROCEDURAL AND FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b176-9\">\u00b65 Erene\u2019s late husband, David Briese (David) was a member of the SRS as a result of his employment as a deputy sheriff for Yellowstone County. The SRS is administered by the Montana Public Employees\u2019 Retirement Administration (MPERA), and governed by the MPERB. In 2001, David designated Erene as his primary beneficiary under the SRS plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-10\">\u00b66 In 2004, David filed a petition for dissolution of marriage. Under \u00a7 40-4-121(3), MCA, the dissolution court issued a standard temporary restraining order that restrained both parties from disposing of property, except in the usual course of business or for the necessities of life, without either the consent of the other party or an order of the court, or from changing the beneficiaries of \u201cinsurance or other coverage ... held for the benefit of a party ....\u201d In August 2006, while the marital dissolution proceedings were still pending, and without consent of Erene or the court, David filed a new designation with the SRS, dropping Erene as beneficiary and naming instead their two minor children. David was killed in the line of duty a few months later, in November 2006. At the time of his death, David and Erene were separated but not divorced.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-11\">\u00b67 Erene apparently learned of the 2006 change in beneficiary in early 2008. Counsel for Erene sent a letter to MPERA notifying the agency that Erene considered the 2006 change of beneficiaries to be void because it was done in violation of the temporary restraining order. MPERA wrote back, stating that it was statutorily obligated to honor the 2006 designation of David and Erene\u2019s children as beneficiaries, and instructing Erene, as the surviving parent of the minor children, to choose among various options for payment. Erene responded by submitting the necessary forms to activate monthly payments to Erene for the benefit of the children.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-12\">\u00b68 In 2009, Erene discovered that the payment of benefits to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>children rather than to her had adverse tax consequences for the family, and she sought again to have David\u2019s 2001 beneficiary designation enforced by MPERA. MPERA issued an \u201cadministrative decision,\u201d again denying Erene\u2019s request, and informing her of her right of administrative appeal. Erene appealed to the MPERB, which also denied her request.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-3\">\u00b69 In December 2009, Erene requested that the MPERB\u2019s denial of benefits be formally reviewed by a hearing examiner under the Montana Administrative Procedure Act (Title 2, chapter 4, MCA). By agreement of the parties, no hearing was held. The hearing examiner proposed, and the MPERB adopted, a final order holding that (1) Erene waived her right to contest the validity of the 2006 beneficiary designation when she applied for benefits on behalf of her children; (2) the issue was moot because, once benefits were granted to her children, the parties could not be restored to their original positions; and (3) the temporary restraining order in the dissolution proceedings was not applicable to an SRS beneficiary designation.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-4\">\u00b610 Erene petitioned the First Judicial District Court for judicial review of the MPERB\u2019s final order. The District Court affirmed the order without addressing the waiver or mootness arguments, finding that the temporary restraining order did not apply to David\u2019s designation of SRS beneficiaries.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-5\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b177-6\">\u00b611 On judicial review of an agency\u2019s decision subject to the Montana Administrative Procedure Act, a district court reviews findings of fact for clear error and conclusions of law for correctness. <em>Micone v. Dept. of Pub. Health &amp; Human Servs., </em>2011 MT 178, \u00b6 10, 361 Mont. 258, 258 P.3d 403 (citing <em>In re Fair Hearing of Hofer, </em>2005 MT 302, \u00b6\u00b6 13-14, 329 Mont. 368, 124 P.3d 1098). The same standard applies to our subsequent review of the district court decision. <em>Micone, </em>\u00b6 10. A district court\u2019s interpretation of a statute is a conclusion of law, which we review for correctness. <em>In re Marriage of Funk, </em>2012 MT 14, \u00b6 6, 363 Mont. 352, 270 P.3d 39 (citing In <em>re C.D.H., </em>2009 MT 8, \u00b6 21, 349 Mont. 1, 201 P.3d 126).</p>\n<p id=\"b177-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b177-8\">\u00b612 <em>1. Did Erene\u2019s application for and acceptance of benefits on behalf of the children render her claim moot or waive her right to challenge the beneficiary designation?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b177-9\">\u00b613 Before reaching the substantive issue in this appeal, we address <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>MPERB\u2019s claims that the issue is moot, or that Erene waived her claim when she applied for benefits on behalf of her minor children.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-4\">\u00b614 Mootness is a threshold issue which must be resolved before addressing the underlying dispute. <em>Med. Marijuana Growers Ass\u2019n v. Corrigan, </em>2012 MT 146, \u00b6 18, 365 Mont. 346, 281 P.3d 210 (citing <em>Povsha v. City of Billings, </em>2007 MT 353, \u00b6 19, 340 Mont. 346, 174 P.3d 515). The mootness doctrine is one of several doctrines designed to limit the judicial power of this Court to justiciable controversies-that is, controversies \u201cupon which a court\u2019s judgment will effectively operate, as distinguished from... dispute[s] invoking a purely political, administrative, philosophical, or academic conclusion.\u201d <em>Progressive Direct Ins. Co. v. Stuivenga, </em>2012 MT 75, \u00b6 16, 364 Mont. 390, 276 P.3d 867. The fundamental question to be answered in any review of possible mootness is \u201cwhether it is possible to grant some form of effective relief to the appellant.\u201d <em>Stuivenga, </em>\u00b6 37.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-5\">\u00b615 MPERB claims that it is impossible to grant effective relief to Erene because, once the payments commenced, MPERB had fully discharged its obligations under the law. MPERB cites \u00a7 19-2-803, MCA, in support of its position. That section provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b178-6\">(1) ... [I]f any benefit from a system is payable to a minor, the benefit must be paid to one of the following: (a) a surviving parent, if any</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b178-7\">(3) The payment must be in full and complete discharge and acquittance of the board and system on account of the benefit. The person receiving benefit payments pursuant to this section shall account to the minor for the money when the minor reaches the age of majority.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b178-8\">We conclude that \u00a7 19-2-803, MCA, does not prevent the Court from granting relief or render moot the issue raised on appeal. Read as a whole, it protects MPERB from a minor\u2019s direct claims for <em>additional </em>payment <em>after </em>proper payment already has been made to a surviving parent or other designated recipient on behalf of the minor. The effect of the statute is to make the person receiving the benefit accountable directly to the minor. It does not apply to this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-9\">\u00b616 Pointing out that she did not elect a lump-sum payment, Erene claims it is possible to grant her effective relief by ordering that all future monthly payments be made to her in her own capacity, as well as by ordering the issuance of corrected tax forms. We agree with Erene that it is possible to grant some form of effective relief, at least <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>insofar as future monthly payments are concerned. Since MPERB did not address the issuance of corrected tax forms in its brief on appeal, we presume this is no longer a point of contention and do not address it further.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-3\">\u00b617 MPERB next argues that, even if the case is not moot, Erene has waived her challenge by applying for and accepting benefits on behalf of the children under the 2006 beneficiary designation. Waiver is the voluntary and intentional relinquishment of a known right, and must be manifested in some unequivocal manner. <em>Tvedt v. Farmers Ins. Group of Cos., </em>2004 MT 125, \u00b6 33, 321 Mont. 263, 91 P.3d 1 (citing <em>Idaho Asphalt Supply v. DOT, </em>1999 MT 291, \u00b6\u00b6 19, 23, 297 Mont. 66, 991 P.2d 434).</p>\n<p id=\"b179-4\">\u00b618  When denying Erene\u2019s initial claim for benefits in 2008, MPERA did not inform her of her right to challenge the denial by appeal to MPERB. Under Admin. R. M. 2.43.1501(2) (2003), Erene had the right to appeal MPERA\u2019s decision to MPERB. MPERA, in two separate letters to Erene dated May 30, 2008, (1) stated that MPERA was \u201crequire[d]\u201d to honor the 2006 change of beneficiaries, and (2) informed Erene that she \u201cmust complete, have notarized and return to this office\u201d the claim forms for the children before being provided with the payment options that were available. It gave no indication that further review was available by appeal to MPERB under Admin. R. M. 2.43.1501(2) at that time. As a matter of due process, MPERA was obligated to inform Erene of any right to appeal and the procedures for seeking such appeal. <em>See Pickens v. Shelton-Thompson, </em>2000 MT 131, \u00b6\u00b6 13, 15, 300 Mont. 16, 3 P.3d 603 (citing Mont. Const, art. II, \u00a7 17; <em>Dorwart v. Caraway, </em>1998 MT 191, \u00b6 76, 290 Mont. 196, 966 P.2d 1121).</p>\n<p id=\"b179-5\">\u00b619  It was not until July 2009 that MPERA informed Erene of her appeal rights, in a letter that also stated that she had already \u201cmooted\u201d her argument by applying for benefits on her children\u2019s behalf more than a year earlier. As Erene\u2019s counsel told the District Court, under the circumstances, Erene had little choice but to apply for the benefits when she did because MPERA did not give her any other options and \u201cshe had to support the kids.\u201d Under these circumstances, we do not agree that Erene\u2019s application for benefits on behalf of her children in June 2008 was a voluntary and intentional relinquishment of a known right. We conclude that she did not waive her argument and we proceed to the merits of her claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-6\">\u00b620 <em>2. Does a temporary restraining order issued in a marital dissolution proceeding under \u00a7 40-4-121(3), MCA, apply to the </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number><em>designation of a beneficiary under the Sheriffs\u2019 Retirement System ?</em></p>\n<p id=\"Ac\">\u00b621 When David filed his 2006 change of beneficiaries, MPERB had no knowledge of the dissolution proceedings and, therefore, no reason to question the new designation. Section 19-2-801(l)-(2), MCA, allows a member to designate a beneficiary on a membership card and, \u201c[ujnless otherwise provided by statute,\u201d to change that designation by filing with the board a new membership card. Subsection (4) provides that, in general, \u201cthe beneficiary designation on the most recent membership card filed with the board is effective for all purposes until the member retires.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b180-4\">\u00b622 Erene argues, however, that David\u2019s 2006 change of designation was invalid and void as a matter of law because it violated the temporary restraining order issued in the marital dissolution proceeding under \u00a7 40-4-121(3), MCA. If the 2006 designation is invalidated, then \u201cthe most recent membership card filed with the board\u201d is the 2001 membership card designating her as David\u2019s beneficiary.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-5\">\u00b623 Section 40-4-121(3), MCA, provides, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b180-6\">When the clerk of the district court issues a summons pursuant to this chapter [(Termination of Marriage, Child Custody, Support)], the clerk shall issue and include with the summons a temporary restraining order:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b180-7\">(a) restraining both parties from transferring, encumbering, hypothecating, concealing, or in any way disposing of any property, real or personal, whether jointly or separately held, without either the consent of the other party or an order of the court, except in the usual course of business or for the necessities of life....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b180-8\">(b) restraining both parties from cashing, borrowing against, canceling, transferring, disposing of, or changing the beneficiaries of any insurance or other coverage, including life, health, automobile, and disability coverage held for the benefit of a party or a child of a party for whom support may be ordered....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b180-9\">The question posed by this case is whether the restriction of a restraining order issued under this statute on \u201cchanging the beneficiaries of any insurance or other coverage\u201d applies to a change of beneficiary under the SRS. We hold that it does.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-10\">\u00b624 Section 40-4-101, MCA, provides that Montana\u2019s law concerning separation and dissolution of marriage, which encompasses the statute at issue in this case,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b180-11\">shall be liberally construed and applied to promote its underlying <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>purposes, which are to:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-3\">(1) strengthen and preserve the integrity of marriage and safeguard family relationships;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-4\">(2) promote the amicable settlement of disputes that have arisen between parties to a marriage;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-5\">(3) <em>mitigate the potential harm to the spouses and their children caused by the process of legal dissolution of marriage', </em>[and]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-6\">(4) <em>make reasonable provision for spouse and minor children during and after litigation ....</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b181-7\">(Emphases added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b181-8\">\u00b625 The purpose of the law requiring a temporary restraining order is clearly to maintain the status quo with respect to all property of the parties. The statute is expansively worded to capture any property, real or personal, along with any inchoate right to property as the beneficiary of \u201cany insurance or other coverage.\u201d This action mitigates the potential harm to spouses and children caused by the dissolution process itself and ensures that reasonable provision is made for the spouse and children during the litigation. The plain language of subsection (b) is quite broad, restricting both parties from unilaterally \u201cchanging the beneficiaries of <em>any ... </em>coverage ... held for the benefit of a party.\u201d Section 40-4-121(3)(b), MCA (emphasis added). On its face, therefore, the statute appears to restrict the removal of a spouse as a beneficiary under <em>any </em>type of benefit coverage, including as a beneficiary of an SRS retirement account, so long as a dissolution action is pending.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-9\">\u00b626 This interpretation is buttressed by application of the doctrine of statutory construction known as <em>ejusdem generis. </em>Under this doctrine, where a list of specific things is followed by a more general word or phrase, the general word or phrase is interpreted to include only items that are \u201csimilar in nature\u201d to those listed. <em>Mattson v. Montana Power Co., </em>2009 MT 286, \u00b6 32, 352 Mont. 212, 215 P.3d 675 (quoting <em>Circuit City Stores v. Adams, </em>532 U.S. 105, 114-15, 121 S. Ct. 1302, 1309 (2001)). The statute specifically mentions life insurance among the types of coverage \u201cinclud[ed]\u201d in its restriction. The SRS coverage given to beneficiaries of deceased members is \u201csimilar in nature\u201d to life insurance. <em>See Schade v. Arizona State Retirement Sys., </em>510 P.2d 42, 44 (Ariz. 1973) (\u201cThe benefits provided for beneficiaries under the State Employees\u2019 Retirement System ... are in the nature of proceeds of an annuity or life insurance contract.\u201d); <em>Rogers v. Rogers, </em>152 So.2d 183, 186 (Fla. 1st Dist. App. 1963) (benefits provided for designated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>beneficiaries under the Florida Teachers\u2019 Retirement System are in the nature of the proceeds of a life insurance contract); <em>Teachers\u2019 Retirement Sys. v. Vial, </em>304 So.2d 53, 56-57 (La. 1st Cir. App. 1974), <em>aff'd, </em>317 So.2d 179 (La. 1975) (death benefit features of the Teachers\u2019 Retirement System are indistinguishable from life insurance); <em>cf. Sowell v. Teachers\u2019 Retirement Sys., </em>214 Mont. 200, 204-05, 693 P.2d 1222, 1224-25 (1984) (comparing precedent concerning life insurance to the designation of a beneficiary in the Montana Teachers\u2019 Retirement System and applying statutes to determine beneficiary of death benefits).</p>\n<p id=\"b182-4\">\u00b627  Under a standard life insurance contract, payment is made upon the death of the insured to a \u201cbeneficiary\u201d designated by the insured. <em>See </em>43 Am. Jur. 2d <em>Insurance </em>\u00a7\u00a7 533, 1668 (LEXIS current through 2011). Under the SRS plan, payment is made upon the death of the member to a \u201cbeneficiary\u201d designated by the member. <em>See </em>Admin. R. M. 2.43.1302(22) (2012) (defining a \u201cprimary beneficiary\u201d as \u201ca beneficiary designated to receive payments upon the death of a member\u201d). Like life insurance, the beneficiary designation is part of an agreement to pay monies on the death of the member and, like life insurance, the payment is not realized during the member\u2019s lifetime. The death benefits inure to the beneficiary directly through the decedent\u2019s designation of the beneficiary, the primary distinction being that the designation is made under and by virtue of specific statutory authority rather than under an insurance contract. Sections 19-7-901, 19-7-503(2), 19-7-801(5)(b)(ii), MCA; <em>see Vial, </em>304 So.2d at 56-58. The coverage provided to Erene by David\u2019s designation of her as a \u201cbeneficiary\u201d under the SRS plan-coverage that provides protection to the beneficiary in the event of the death of the member-is \u201csimilar in nature\u201d to life insurance, and therefore included within the language of \u00a7 40-4-121(3)(b), MCA, and the restraining order.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-5\">\u00b628 The statute, moreover, is not confined to \u201cinsurance\u201d but also includes \u201cany ... other coverage.\u201d We construe a statute to give effect to all of its provisions. Section 1-2-101, MCA; <em>see also State v. Booth, </em>2012 MT 40, \u00b6 12, 364 Mont. 190, 272 P.3d 89. Section 40-4-121(3)(b), MCA, construed liberally and applied to promote its underlying purposes, prohibits any changes of beneficiary under the SRS plan, if the beneficiary at the time the restraining order is issued is a \u201cparty or a child of a party for whom support may be ordered.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b182-6\">\u00b629 MPERB\u2019s reliance on cases from other jurisdictions in which specific restraining orders were held to be too vague to apply to a change of beneficiaries for death benefits is misplaced. As indicated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>above, the language of Montana\u2019s standard restraining order clearly enjoins any change of beneficiaries for \u201cany... coverage ... held for the benefit of a party.\u201d The broad language restraining a change of beneficiaries eliminates any need to specifically list all of the types of accounts to which it applies. The use of the term <em>\u201cincluding </em>life, health, automobile, and disability coverage\u201d indicates that this listing of types of coverage is not exclusive. (Emphasis added.) <em>See e.g. In re Marriage of Keepers, </em>213 Mont. 350, 356, 691 P.2d 810, 813 (1984); Norman J. Singer &amp; J.D. Shambie Singer, <em>Sutherland on Statutes and Statutory Construction </em>vol. 2A, \u00a7 47.23, 417 (7th ed., West 2007) (\u201cWhen \u2018include\u2019 is utilized, it is generally improper to conclude that entities not specifically enumerated are excluded.\u201d). The restraining order in this case applied to David\u2019s change of SRS beneficiary.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-3\">\u00b630  That Montana law did not <em>require </em>David to designate Erene as his beneficiary in the first place does not change the fact that he did so. Once Erene was designated as a beneficiary, the account was held \u201cfor the benefit of\u2019 Erene as well as David, and the restraining order applied. Nor does it matter that the change of beneficiaries did not affect the value of David\u2019s retirement benefits or how they ultimately may have been distributed as part of the marital estate. Under its plain language, the temporary restraining order issued under \u00a7 40-4-121(3)(b), MCA, prohibited David from changing his SRS beneficiary during the marriage dissolution proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-4\">\u00b631  Finally, the fact that David substituted his children, who also were protected by the temporary restraining order, for his spouse does not change the result. Section 40-4-121(3)(b), MCA, does not include any exceptions for changes to beneficiaries from spouse to protected child or vice versa.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> A temporary restraining order issued under the broad restriction of the statute prohibits a party\u2019s attempt to change one of those designated beneficiaries during the proceeding. David\u2019s 2006 change of beneficiaries was unlawful because it was made in violation of the restraining order and \u00a7 40-4-121(3), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-5\">\u00b632 MPERB nonetheless argues that the temporary restraining order does not apply to it because it was not a party to the dissolution action, citing \u00a7\u00a7 40-4-121(3)(b) and 27-19-105, MCA. The restraining order did not, by its terms, restrain MPERB from any particular acts. Nor was MPERB a \u201cpersonD in active concert or participation with [David]\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>within the meaning of \u00a7 27-19-105(4), MCA. Whether MPERB was bound by the terms of the restraining order is not the issue here, however. Under \u00a7 19-2-801(2), MCA, a member is not allowed to change beneficiaries in violation of a statutory provision. David\u2019s 2006 beneficiary designation was made in violation of a statutorily-mandated court order that was binding on him.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-4\">\u00b633 Section 40-4-121(3)(b), MCA, provides protection to some individuals or entities affected by a violation of the temporary restraining order. That provision states: \u201c[NJothing in this subsection (3) adversely affects the rights, title, or interest of a purchaser, encumbrancer, or lessee for value if the purchaser, encumbrancer, or lessee does not have actual knowledge of the restraining order.\u201d As administrator of the retirement system, MPERA is not a \u201cpurchaser, encumbrancer, or lessee for value\u201d under \u00a7 40-4-121(3)(b). Furthermore, MPERA obtained actual knowledge of the restraining order early in 2008, before any benefits were paid, when Erene\u2019s counsel sent a letter challenging David\u2019s 2006 change of beneficiaries. \u00b634 MPERB further contends that public policy and legislative intent do not support application of \u00a7 40-4-12 l(3)(b), MCA, to beneficiary changes in the SRS plan, <em>citing Sowell, </em>214 Mont. at 207, 693 P.2d at 1226, and <em>State ex rel. Neuhausen v. Nachtsheim, </em>253 Mont. 296, 301, 833 P.2d 201, 204 (1992), <em>superseded, </em>1993 Mont. Laws ch. 259. Neither of those cases applies to Erene\u2019s case, however, as neither of them interpreted \u00a7 40-4-121(3)(b), MCA, or involved the effect of a temporary restraining order. <em>Sowell </em>involved a claim for death benefits by a surviving spouse who had never been named as a beneficiary, not, as in Erene\u2019s case, a spouse who was the properly designated beneficiary at the time a restraining order restricting changes to the beneficiary was issued. <em>Neuhausen </em>did not even address a claim for death benefits by a beneficiary, but rather involved the division of retirement benefits between a member and his ex-spouse as part of a divorce decree.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-5\">\u00b635 Also inapt is MPERB\u2019s citation to \u00a7 19-2-1004, MCA, which states, in relevant part, that \u201cthe right of a person to any benefit or payment from a retirement system or plan\u201d is not subject to execution, garnishment, attachment or any other process. This provision does not prevent MPERB or a district court from determining the rights of various parties to the benefits of the plan in the first place, as in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-6\">\u00b636 The Dissent questions the administrative forum in which Erene has raised her claim for benefits and argues that MPERB committed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>\u201cno legal error,\u201d suggesting that Erene\u2019s only remedy was to request relief in the dissolution proceeding or to file a separate declaratory judgment action. We have held that \u201can action [for] dissolution of marriage abates upon the death of either party prior to the entry of decree, and at that time the trial court loses jurisdiction to determine incidental issues such as the disposition of property rights involved in the marriage.\u201d <em>In re Marriage of Lawrence, </em>212 Mont. 327, 330-31, 687 P.2d 1026, 1028 (1984). We need not decide in this case whether a court retains jurisdiction over the enforcement of orders entered before one of the spouses has died. <em>See Aither v. Estate of Aither, </em>913 A.2d 376, 379 (Vt. 2006) (noting split of authority). Here, MPERB claimed the authority to determine the applicability of a restraining order issued pursuant to \u00a7 40-4-121(3), MCA, to an SRS account, and found it to be inapplicable as a matter of law. Erene properly pursued this request for judicial review in order to adjudicate the validity of MPERB\u2019s determination, and the District Court had the authority to decide that issue. Section 2-4-704(2)(a)(i), (iv), MCA (authorizing reversal of an agency decision if the district court determines that the administrative decision is \u201cin violation of... statutory provisions\u201d or \u201caffected by other error of law\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b185-3\">\u00b637 Either MPERB or Erene could have resolved any uncertainties in MPERB\u2019s legal obligations by seeking a declaratory judgment under the provisions of Montana\u2019s Uniform Declaratory Judgments Act, Title 27, chapter 8, MCA. <em>See </em>\u00a7 27-8-102, MCA (stating that the purpose of the Act is \u201cto settle and to afford relief from uncertainty and insecurity with respect to rights, status, and other legal relations\u201d); <em>Sowell, </em>214 Mont. at 202, 693 P.2d at 1223 (action brought by a denied claimant \u201cto declare her rights with respect to the retirement and death benefit account of... deceased\u201d). The availability of an alternative remedy did not foreclose Erene\u2019s right to judicial review of MPERB\u2019s administrative determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-4\">\u00b638 We have not had occasion to address the question whether a violation of a temporary restraining order automatically voids the beneficiary change. In most cases, the remedy for violation of a restraining order is a civil or criminal contempt action against the violator. <em>See </em>\u00a7\u00a7 3-l-501(l)(e), 45-7-309(l)(c), MCA. Such a remedy, however, is \u201cno remedy at all in this context; it evaporates [with the death of the violator,] the instant it is needed.\u201d <em>Aither, </em>913 A.2d at 380. \u00b639 Courts from other jurisdictions have taken various approaches toward this problem. Many courts have held that a court may set aside an improper change of beneficiaries and award the proceeds to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>beneficiary who was protected by the restraining order. In <em>Webb v. Webb, </em>134 N.W.2d 673, 674-75 (Mich. 1965), for example, the Michigan Supreme Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b186-4\">It needs no citation that for violation of an injunction, a court, under its general powers, may order a return to the <em>status quo.... </em>Transfers of property in violation of an injunction are invalid and may be set aside ... and subsequent death of the injunction violator does not prevent the court from exercising such power.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AoH\">(Citations omitted.) <em>See also Northwestern Mutual Life Ins. Co. v. Hahn, </em>713 N.W. 2d 709, 712 (Iowa App. 2006) (\u201c[A] court may set aside a change in beneficiary of a life insurance policy made in violation of a temporary injunction.\u201d); <em>Aither, </em>913 A.2d at 381 (\u201cBecause husband\u2019s change in the beneficiaries of his life insurance policy was in violation of the family court order, wife may be entitled to a return to the status quo the order was intended to preserve.\u201d); <em>Standard Ins. Co. v. Schwalbe, </em>755 P.2d 802, 806 (Wash. 1988) (\u201c[W]e hold that the trial court had the power to award the insurance proceeds to ... the named beneficiary protected by the preliminary injunction.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b186-5\">\u00b640 Other courts, while holding that the violation does not serve to <em>automatically </em>void the beneficiary change, generally have found that courts have the authority to grant some form of relief through use of their powers of equity. <em>See e.g. Valley Forge Life Ins. Co. v. Delaney, </em>313 F. Supp. 2d 1305, 1307-09 (M.D. Fla. 2002) (rejecting a per se rule that automatically voids beneficiary changes made in violation of a temporary injunction, but acknowledging that a removed beneficiary may seek redress in a court of equity); <em>Davis v. Prudential Ins. Co., </em>331 F.2d 346, 349-51 (5th Cir. 1964) (holding that an injunction does not void automatically a prohibited transfer, but that the surviving spouse nevertheless was entitled to recovery under a theory of constructive fraud); <em>American Family Life Ins. Co. v. Noruk, </em>528 N.W.2d 921, 923-24 (Minn. App. 1995) (rejecting a bright-line rule under which a change of beneficiary made in violation of a temporary court order would be void as a matter of law, holding that \u201cequitable principles, rather than a per se rule, should govern\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b186-6\">\u00b641  At a minimum, we agree with those courts that have held that a court has equitable power to order a return to the status quo when <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>a party violating a temporary restraining order has died.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Thus, in this case, the District Court should have invalidated David\u2019s 2006 change of beneficiaries because it was made in violation of the statutorily-mandated restraining order, and should have determined that his 2001 designation of Erene is \u201cthe most recent membership card filed with the board\u201d under \u00a7 19-2-801(4)(a), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-3\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b187-4\">\u00b642 The District Court\u2019s order of October 7,2011, is reversed. The case is remanded for entry of judgment declaring the 2006 beneficiary designation invalid and for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<judges id=\"b187-5\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES NELSON, COTTER, WHEAT and MORRIS concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b175-15\"> We will use the term \u201cdeath benefits\u201d to refer to any type of payment to a designated beneficiary upon the death of an SRS member before retirement under \u00a7 19-7-901, MCA.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b183-6\"> David could have changed his SRS beneficiary with the consent of Erene or an order of the court. <em>Cfi </em>\u00a7 40-4-121(3)(a), MCA (restraining both parties from disposing of any property \u201cwithout either the consent of the other party or an order of the court\u201d). There is no indication in the record that he had either consent or a court order.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b187-9\"> As the California Supreme Court has observed, \u201c[t]he purpose of the provisions requiring the filing of a change of beneficiary is largely to protect the retirement system against the possibility of being called upon to pay twice.\u201d <em>Watenpaugh v. State Teachers\u2019 Retirement Sys., </em>336 P.2d 165, 169 (Cal. 1959). Erene is not asking MPERB to pay twice, nor is she asking for a recipient who was wrongfully paid benefits to return them. We do not, therefore, express any opinion on a district court\u2019s authority to make an equitable distribution in such a circumstance.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b187-6\">JUSTICE NELSON,</author>\n<p id=\"Axm\">concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-7\">\u00b643 I concur in the Court\u2019s Opinion on the facts presented here. It is especially troubling to me that MPERA failed to notify Erene of her right to appeal the agency\u2019s denial of her challenge to David\u2019s change of beneficiary and that MPERA effectively stampeded Erene into applying for benefits. Opinion, \u00b6\u00b6 7,17-19. It is equally troubling that MPERA obtained actual knowledge of the restraining order before any benefits were paid, yet went ahead and commenced paying benefits pursuant to David\u2019s change of beneficiary with the knowledge that the change was being challenged. Opinion, \u00b6 33. Given the agency\u2019s knowledge of the restraining order, of Erene\u2019s challenge, and of the legal questions of first impression at issue, it seems to me that MPERA, taking a conservative approach, could have worked through the court system to reach a temporary, and ultimately final, disposition of this matter that would have protected the interests of both Erene and the agency. Under the circumstances described above, it is difficult not to conclude that MPERA was the author of its own problems.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-8\">\u00b644 I believe the Court\u2019s legal analysis is sound and achieves the correct result in this case. I am somewhat reluctant, however, to extrapolate beyond that for several reasons. First, this is a case of first <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>impression and, as noted, the facts here militate in Erene\u2019s favor. Our jurisprudence will necessarily have to develop on a case-by-case basis, consistent with the facts and how, if at all, the Legislature addresses these sorts of situations. Second, it is important to acknowledge that in many dissolution cases, the public employee\u2019s retirement benefit may be the only significant asset in the marital estate. Accordingly, it is vital that this asset be properly distributed according to whatever law applies under the circumstances. Third, this case also demonstrates the need for the Legislature to amend the statutes in Titles 40 and 19, MCA, to deal with situations such as that presented here and other cases where the member changes beneficiaries in violation of a temporary restraining order. In this regard, and in fairness to MPERA, such statutory amendments should require that where a member is involved in a dissolution proceeding, any temporary restraining order similar to the one in this case must be, upon issuance, contemporaneously served on the agency and provide that the agency be allowed to intervene in the proceedings to the extent necessary to resolve any dispute in the distribution of the member\u2019s retirement benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-4\">\u00b645 With those caveats and suggestions, I concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b188-5\">JUSTICE RICE,</author>\n<p id=\"AO\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-6\">\u00b646 This administrative appeal challenges MPERB\u2019s implementation of David\u2019s 2006 beneficiary designation and refusal to reverse that action, which Erene argues was an \u201cerroneous decision.\u201d However, Erene has established no legal error on the part of MPERB.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-7\">\u00b647 MPERB properly acted pursuant to its contractual, statutory, and constitutional obligations to honor the beneficiary request made to it by David in 2006. <em>See </em>\u00a7 19-2-502, MCA; Mont. Const, art. VIII, \u00a7 15. The Court nonetheless reverses MPERB\u2019s actions and faults MPERB for failing to seek a declaratory judgment to resolve \u201cany uncertainties in [its] legal obligations.\u201d Opinion, \u00b6 37. The Court attempts, but fails to correctly identify, any legal error committed by MPERB, and acknowledges, as it must, that MPERB was not subject to the temporary restraining order (TRO). Clearly, there were no uncertainties in MPERB\u2019s obligations, but more, it was not MPERB\u2019s duty to resolve any uncertainties that Erene may have perceived.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-8\">\u00b648 As the Court notes, the TRO, by its own express terms, was directed to, and applied to, David and Erene only (\u201cRespondent and Petitioner are hereby restrained from ....\u201d). The TRO was not directed to any third parties, here, MPERB. This is consistent with statute. Section 40-4-121(3), MCA, provides that a domestic TRO restrains <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>\u201cboth parties\u201d from acting to transfer their assets. Likewise, \u00a7 27-19-105, MCA, governing the scope of injunctions and restraining orders, provides that a restraining order shall <em>\u201cbe binding only </em>upon the parties to the action; their officers, agents, employees, and attorneys; and <em>those persons </em>in active concert or participation with them who receive actual notice of the order by personal service or otherwise.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Although MPERB had not received notice of the TRO when it acted, thus excluding it from the TRO\u2019s reach, that is not the important point. Critically, under the statute, MPERB was not a \u201cperson\u201d acting in concert or participation with David. Section 27-19-105, MCA. Rather, MPERB was a government agency acting pursuant to its legal obligations and authority. While David was bound by the TRO, MPERB was not. Rather, it was bound to follow the law governing the agency.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-3\">\u00b649 Fundamentally, and consistent with our statutes above cited, \u201c[cjourts are without jurisdiction to enjoin administrative agencies from performing the duties delegated to them by proper statute or authority.\u201d 42 Am. Jur. 2d <em>Injunctions </em>\u00a7 156 (2010). Instead, an injunction or restraining order \u201cis an appropriate remedy to prevent wrongful acts by a public official who is <em>acting without lawful authority </em>and beyond the scope of his or her official power ....\u201d 42 Am. Jur. 2d <em>Injunctions </em>\u00a7 156 (emphasis added). MPERB was unquestionably acting within its lawful authority to meet its clear legal obligations to David, and in so doing, was not subject to the TRO. MPERB was faced with no \u201cuncertainties\u201d in its legal obligations which compelled it to seek a declaratory judgment, as the Court declares. Opinion, \u00b6 37. There being nothing legally improper about MPERB\u2019s actions, Erene\u2019s administrative appeal of that action should be rejected.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-4\">\u00b650 The Court seeks to evade these principles by declaring whether \u201cMPERB was bound by the terms of the restraining order is not the issue,\u201d Opinion, \u00b6 32, but the Court is mistaken. The premise of Erene\u2019s challenge is that MPERB erred in failing to reverse its actions when presented with the TRO. The TRO is the only order which MPERB is alleged to have violated. If MPERB complied with governing law in changing the beneficiary, and was not subject to the TRO, its decision is not subject to reversal in this administrative proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-5\">\u00b651 The Court acknowledges that the legal error here-changing beneficiaries in violation of the TRO-was committed by <em>David. </em>Opinion, \u00b6 34. However, realizing that David\u2019s error cannot serve as a basis to reverse MPERB\u2019s actions in this administrative appeal, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>Court attempts to manufacture error on the part of MPERB. The Court reasons that MPERB\u2019s reversible error occurred when it found that \u00a7 40-4-121(3), MCA, was \u201cinapplicable as a matter of law\u201d to an SRS account. Opinion, \u00b6 36. However, even assuming <em>arguendo </em>that MPERB so erred, such an error in statutory interpretation still would not subject MPERB to the TRO, and therefore does not establish that MPERB committed reversible error for purposes of this administrative proceeding. An error in <em>interpretation </em>does not necessarily equate to an error in <em>action, </em>and here MPERB clearly acted properly by complying with its governing authority. Again, the TRO was directed to the parties, not MPERB. MPERB was obligated to comply with its governing authority until and unless it received a proper legal directive to do otherwise. MPERB acknowledges it is subject to family law orders affecting retirement plans entered pursuant to \u00a7 19-2-907, MCA, which the Legislature specifically enacted to authorize courts to recognize and modify retirement plans within domestic proceedings, following our decision to the contrary in <em>Neuhausen. </em>However, such an order was apparently never pursued, and Erene could not turn this administrative appeal into a declaratory judgment action to challenge the validity of <em>David\u2019s </em>actions during the dissolution proceeding. This administrative appeal could only determine whether the agency properly acted under its governing authority, and I would conclude it clearly did so. It should not be this Court\u2019s business to rectify a perceived injustice in disregard to established statutory procedures. \u00b652 If Erene believed that <em>David\u2019s </em>actions had violated the TRO and had created uncertainty, it was incumbent upon her to initiate a declaratory judgment action or seek judicial relief from the dissolution court which had issued the TRO. While I take no position on the merits, a claim that David had violated the TRO would arguably have remained justiciable even after his death. While the dissolution court may well have lost jurisdiction to distribute the marital estate, the question would be whether a death barred the court from addressing a prior and undisclosed violation of a restraining order which had prejudiced a party. Such a question was arguably \u201cone upon which a court\u2019s judgment will effectively operate.\u201d <em>Progressive Direct Ins. Co. v. Stuivenga, </em>2012 MT 75, \u00b6 16, 364 Mont. 390, 276 P.3d 867. Assuming the court determined the TRO had been violated, concrete relief was possible. However, the District Court reviewing MPERB\u2019s actions in this administrative appeal clearly had no authority to address that violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-4\">\u00b653 I would affirm the District Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
