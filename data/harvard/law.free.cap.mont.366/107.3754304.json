We restate the issues as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b134-10\">\u00b64 1. Did the District Court err when it held that the jury determined causation?</p>\n<p id=\"b134-11\">\u00b65 2. Does substantive evidence in the record support the amount of restitution awarded?</p>\n<p id=\"b134-12\">\u00b66 3. Were Edward\u2019s constitutional rights to a jury and a fair trial violated?</p>\n<p id=\"b134-13\">\u00b67 4. Did Edward receive ineffective assistance of counsel?</p>\n<p id=\"b134-14\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b134-15\">\u00b68 On May 26, 2010, Edward exited a beauty salon in Billings, Montana. As Edward drove out of the parking lot, Karen Zaso (Zaso) was riding her bicycle on the sidewalk, going southbound against traffic. According to two witnesses, a collision occurred between Edward\u2019s car and Zaso\u2019s bicycle. Joseph Desson (Desson), one of the witnesses, testified that Edward\u2019s car hit Zaso\u2019s bicycle and that Zaso was thrown into the street in front of his vehicle. Desson said he stopped abruptly to avoid running over Zaso, and was then rear-ended by the vehicle behind him. Lynsey Hagan (Hagan), the other witness and a passenger in the vehicle behind the vehicle that rear-ended Desson\u2019s vehicle, also testified that Edward\u2019s vehicle hit Zaso\u2019s bicycle. According to Hagan, Edward did not appear to know she had hit someone, and she looked as if she was going to run Zaso over after Zaso fell to the ground. Hagan testified that when Zaso got up, Edward said something to Zaso and then drove away. Hagan memorized Edward\u2019s license plate number and gave it to the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>\u00b69 A Billings police officer (Officer) responded to the accident and spoke to the witnesses at the scene. The Officer\u2019s report stated that Edward\u2019s vehicle pulled out of the location of the salon and hit a bicyclist on the sidewalk, knocking the bicyclist into the northbound driving lane of the street and causing another accident. According to the report, Zaso was transported by ambulance to the Billings Clinic Emergency Room.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-4\">\u00b610 Later that same day the Officer spoke to Edward. Edward denied colliding with the bicyclist, though she saw the rear-end vehicle collision occur when Desson abruptly stopped his vehicle. After she watched the collision, Edward said she first saw Zaso when Zaso walked her bicycle around the front end of Edward\u2019s vehicle. Though Edward knew an accident had occurred, she believed she was not required to remain at the scene as she did not think she was involved in the accident. The Officer examined Edward\u2019s vehicle that same day and found no evidence of impact on the vehicle. The Officer later testified that a collision of this sort would not necessarily be expected to leave marks on the vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-5\">\u00b611 The Officer cited Edward for failure to remain at an accident involving personal injury (Failure to Remain), a criminal violation under \u00a7 61-7-103, MCA (2009), and failure to immediately notify authorities of an accident resulting in personal injury or at least $500 in property damage (Failure to Notify), a criminal violation under \u00a7 61-7-108, MCA (2009). The Officer did not issue a citation to Zaso, though under \u00a7\u00a7 24-602 and -609 of the City Code of Billings, it is a misdemeanor for anyone other than authorized law enforcement personnel to ride a bicycle on a sidewalk within a business district, pursuant to \u00a7 61-8-608, MCA (2009). Billings City Code (Mont.) \u00a7\u00a7 24-602 and -609 (current through August 9, 2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b135-6\">\u00b612 A jury trial was held in Billings Municipal Court (Municipal Court) on November 4, 2010, and Edward was convicted of both criminal charges. The jury heard testimony from Edward, Zaso, Desson, Hagan, and the Officer. During deliberations, the jury was initially deadlocked. Without objection, the court delivered <em>sen Allen</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>charge. After further deliberations, the jury asked to re-hear some testimony. The court denied the jury\u2019s request and told the jury it needed to return a unanimous verdict that evening or it could return <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>in the morning to continue deliberating. The jury finished deliberating before dinnertime and returned a guilty verdict on both counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-4\">\u00b613 Meanwhile, in October 2010, Edward\u2019s insurer, State Farm Insurance (State Farm), paid Zaso $21,866.58 for her medical expenses. Zaso also sought reimbursement for the following items: $10 for the accident report, $515 for travel to and from court, $64.13 for lodging when appearing for court, $678.98 for new glasses, $425 for the security deposit for her apartment, $28.57 for Neosporin, gauze pads, and other medical supplies, $4,080 in lost wages, $125 for ink and paper, $15.98 for postage costs, and $150 for her personal time. State Farm declined to pay these costs, as it had already paid Zaso for medical supplies as well as a new bicycle, helmet, and clothing.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-5\">\u00b614 Hearings were held for sentencing and for purposes of establishing restitution. Edward moved to dismiss the restitution hearing, arguing that she had not been found guilty of actually causing the accident, that causation must be tried before a jury, and that Zaso was not entitled to restitution. The Municipal Court rejected Edward\u2019s motion. On her conviction of Failure to Remain, Edward was sentenced to one year in jail with all but thirty days suspended; the thirty days were suspended on the condition that she complete one hundred hours of community service, pay $4,148.60 in restitution to Zaso, and pay court costs and fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-6\">\u00b615 On February 1, 2011, Edward formally appealed the Municipal Court\u2019s restitution order to the District Court. She did not challenge the convictions, suspended sentence, or community service requirement. Edward argued that the restitution obligation should be reversed on four grounds: (1) the absence of a causal connection between the offense and the damage; (2) the causation standard of \u00a7 46-18-243(2)(a), MCA (2009), was not met; (3) she should not be liable for damages Zaso could not recover in a civil suit; and (4) the amount of restitution was not based on substantive evidence. The State of Montana (State) responded on behalf of the City of Billings, arguing that the causation standard was met. After the matter was fully briefed, the District Court affirmed the Municipal Court\u2019s restitution obligation, finding it reasonable upon application of the restitution standards set forth in <em>State v. Ness, </em>2009 MT 300, \u00b6 20, 352 Mont. 317, 216 P.3d 773. The court found that the evidence in the record substantiated the restitution award.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-7\">\u00b616 Edward appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b137-4\">\u00b617 We review a sentence of less than one year of actual incarceration for both legality and abuse of discretion. <em>State v. Breeding, </em>2008 MT 162, \u00b6 10, 343 Mont. 323, 184 P.3d 313; <em>State v. Herman, </em>2008 MT 187, \u00b6 11, 343 Mont. 494, 188 P.3d 978. A criminal sentence is generally reviewed for \u201clegality to determine whether the sentence is within statutory parameters.\u201d <em>Ness, </em>\u00b6 7. \u201cA sentencing court abuses its discretion when it acts arbitrarily without employment of conscientious judgment or exceeds the bounds of reason, resulting in substantial injustice.\u201d <em>Breeding, </em>\u00b6 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-5\">\u00b618 We review the appropriate measure of restitution for correctness. <em>State v. Johnson, </em>2011 MT 116, \u00b6 13, 360 Mont. 443, 254 P.3d 578. We review a district court\u2019s findings of fact regarding the amount of restitution to determine whether they are clearly erroneous. <em>Johnson, </em>\u00b6 13. A finding of fact is \u201cclearly erroneous if [it is] not supported by substantial evidence.\u201d <em>Breeding, </em>\u00b6 11. \u201cSubstantial evidence is \u2018evidence that a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u2019 \u201d <em>Johnston v. Palmer, </em>2007 MT 99, \u00b6 26, 337 Mont. 101, 158 P.3d 998.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-6\">\u00b619 \u201cWe invoke plain error review sparingly, on a case-by-case basis, according to narrow circumstances, and by considering the totality of the case\u2019s circumstances.\u201d <em>State v. Wilson, </em>2011 MT 277, \u00b6 16, 362 Mont. 416, 264 P.3d 1146.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-7\">\u00b620 \u201cA claim of ineffective assistance of counsel presents mixed questions of law and fact that we review de novo.\u201d <em>Herman, </em>f 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-8\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b137-9\">\u00b621 <em>Issue One: Did the District Court err when it held that the jury determined causation?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b137-10\">\u00b622 Edward argues on appeal that the District Court and the Municipal Court erred when they concluded that Edward <em>caused </em>Zaso\u2019s accident, as the elements of the charges of Failure to Remain and Failure to Notify establish no more than the fact that Edward was <em>involved </em>in an accident. Thus, she argues, causation of the accident was never determined and the court was therefore without authority to award Zaso restitution. Edward maintains that thejury should have been required to determine causation prior to the court awarding restitution, and that because no causal connection exists between the two offenses and the damage to Zaso, the restitution award was improper. Edward also argues that Montana\u2019s law of comparative negligence entitles Edward to have a jury determine contributory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>negligence of the parties before restitution is assessed.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-4\">\u00b623 The State asserts that the jury did determine causation when it found Edward guilty of the two crimes, and therefore a sufficient causal connection existed between Edward\u2019s criminal conduct and Zaso\u2019s loss to support the restitution award. The State also argues that Edward raises the comparative negligence claim for the first time on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-5\">\u00b624 Edward was convicted of Failure to Remain, pursuant to \u00a7 61-7-103, MCA, which states in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b138-6\">(1) The driver of any vehicle involved in an accident resulting in injury to or death of any person shall immediately stop the vehicle at the sc\u00e9ne of the accident or as close to the accident as possible but shall then return to and in every event remain at the scene of the accident until the driver has fulfilled the requirements of 61-7-105. Each stop at the scene of the accident must be made without obstructing traffic more than is necessary.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AiQ\">Edward was also convicted of Failure to Notify under \u00a7 61-7-108, MCA, which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b138-7\">The driver of a vehicle involved in an accident resulting in injury to or death of any person or property damage to an apparent extent of $500 or more shall immediately by the quickest means of communication give notice of the accident to the local police department if the accident occurs within a municipality, otherwise to the office of the county sheriff or the nearest office of the highway patrol.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b138-8\">\u00b625 The Municipal Court ordered Edward to pay Zaso restitution. Section 46-18-241(1), MCA (2009), provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b138-9\">(1) As provided in 46-18-201, a sentencing court shall, as part of the sentence, require an offender to make full restitution to any victim who has sustained a pecuniary loss, including a person suffering an economic loss. The duty to pay full restitution under the sentence remains with the offender or the offender\u2019s estate until full restitution is paid, whether or not the offender is under state supervision. If the offender is under state supervision, payment of restitution is a condition of any probation or parole.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AdP\">For purposes of this statute, \u201cvictim\u201d means \u201ca person who suffers loss of property, bodily injury, or death as a result of the commission of an offense.\u201d Section 46-18-243(2)(a)(i)(A), MCA (2009). \u201cPecuniary loss\u201d is defined as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b138-10\">(a) all special damages, but not general damages, substantiated by evidence in the record, that a person could <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>recover against the offender in a civil action arising out of the facts or events constituting the offender\u2019s criminal activities, including without limitation out-of-pocket losses, such as medical expenses, loss of income, expenses reasonably incurred in obtaining ordinary and necessary services that the victim would have performed if not injured, expenses reasonably incurred in attending court proceedings related to the commission of the offense, and reasonable expenses related to funeral and burial or crematory services;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b139-4\">(b) the full replacement cost of property taken, destroyed, harmed, or otherwise devalued as a result of the offender\u2019s criminal conduct;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b139-5\">(c) future medical expenses that the victim can reasonably be expected to incur as a result of the offender\u2019s criminal conduct, including the cost of psychological counseling, therapy, and treatment; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b139-6\">(d) reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the victim in filing charges or in cooperating in the investigation and prosecution of the offense.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b139-7\">Section 46-18-243(1), MCA (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b139-8\">\u00b626 We have previously stated that <em>\u201ca </em>causal relation between the offender\u2019s criminal conduct and the pecuniary loss is the touchstone for determining whether a person or entity is a victim entitled to restitution.\u201d <em>State v. Brownback, </em>2010 MT 96, \u00b6 20, 356 Mont. 190, 232 P.3d 385 (citing <em>Breeding, </em>\u00b6 13). We will not hold an offender accountable for restitution for offenses he or she did not commit. <em>Breeding, </em>\u00b6 13. Rather, \u201ca sentencing condition must have \u2018some correlation or connection to the underlying offense for which the defendant is being sentenced,\u2019 \u201d and the nexus requirement applies \u201cto either the offense for which the offender is being sentenced, or to the offender himself or herself.\u201d <em>Ness, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 10,11 n. 2 (citing <em>State v. Ashby, </em>2008 MT 83, \u00b6 15, 342 Mont. 187, 179 P.3d 1164).</p>\n<p id=\"b139-9\">\u00b627 A victim who \u201csuffer[s] loss of property \u2018as a result of the offender\u2019s criminal conduct,\u201d is entitled to restitution. <em>Brownback, </em>\u00b6 20. We said in <em>Ness </em>that when applying \u00a7 46-18-241(1), MCA, some interpretation is required to determine \u201cjust how remote a loss can be before it can no longer be considered to be \u2018a result of the offense.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ness, </em>\u00b6 20 (quoting <em>State v. LaTray, </em>2000 MT 262, \u00b6 14, 302 Mont. 11, 11 P.3d 116). We noted in Ness our understanding that the Legislature intended that restitution be required \u201cfor persons who are affected by a defendant\u2019s actions.\u201d <em>Ness, </em>\u00b6 20. The language of \u00a7 46-18-241(1), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>MCA, \u201cdoes not imply that \u2018direct\u2019 losses are the only ones that qualify.\u201d <em>Ness, </em>\u00b6 20 (quoting <em>LaTray, </em>\u00b6 14).</p>\n<p id=\"b140-4\">\u00b628 Applying the restitution standards as set forth in <em>Ness, </em>the District Court found that the Municipal Court did not abuse its discretion in awarding restitution to Zaso. The District Court reasoned that neither of the offenses for which Edward was convicted included as an element that the defendant must <em>cause </em>injury to the victim. The District Court found the testimony from the neutral third parties \u201ccompelling,\u201d and concluded there was overwhelming evidence against Edward. The District Court observed that a sentencing court shall require an offender to make full restitution to any victim who has sustained pecuniary loss, including that which a person could recover against the offender in a civil action \u201carising out of the facts or events constituting the offender\u2019s criminal activities.\u201d Section 46-18-243(l)(a), MCA; <em>State v. Kalal, </em>2009 MT 103, \u00b6 8, 350 Mont. 128, 204 P.3d 1240. \u00b629 <em>Citing Breeding, </em>Edward argues that because the jury did not find that she <em>caused </em>the accident, it was error for the court to require her to pay restitution. This case is easily distinguishable from <em>Breeding. </em>In <em>Breeding, </em>the defendant was convicted of theft of a motor vehicle and ordered to pay restitution for damage to the car. <em>Breeding, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 4, 5, 8. Breeding appealed, arguing that the order of restitution against him was improper because the damage to the vehicle was caused by another individual <em>before </em>Breeding became involved in the subsequent theft of the car. <em>Breeding, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 1, 3, 5. We agreed, finding no statutory authority for imputing to Breeding the damage caused by a third party. <em>Breeding, </em>\u00b6 19. Here, by contrast, the court concluded based upon the evidence that Edward was directly involved in the accident. \u00b630 It is undisputed that Zaso incurred losses that arose out of the facts or events of the accident, as substantiated by the evidence in the record and as required by \u00a7 46-18-243(l)(a), MCA. The question is whether Zaso\u2019s losses were \u201ca result of the commission of an offense,\u201d as required by \u00a7 46-18-243(2)(a)(i)(A), MCA, and the associated provision for restitution, \u00a7 46-18-241(1), MCA. The Municipal Court found the evidence provided to the jury, including the testimony of four of the five witnesses, was sufficient to allow it to determine that Zaso\u2019s losses resulted from Edward\u2019s commission of the offenses. This testimony included that of Desson and Hagan, both of whom stated they saw Edward\u2019s vehicle hit Zaso\u2019s bicycle. Given the strength of this testimony, we cannot conclude that the court erred in determining that Zaso\u2019s losses resulted from Edward\u2019s commission of the offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-5\">\u00b631 Edward also argues on appeal that Zaso broke the law by riding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>her bicycle on the sidewalk, in violation of \u00a7 24-602 of the City Code of Billings, which provides that \u201c[n]o person shall ride a bicycle on a sidewalk within a business district except authorized law enforcement personnel.\u201d Billings City Code at \u00a7\u00a7 24-602 and -609. She therefore posits that Zaso was negligent per se, and that her negligence contributed to her damages. Edward maintains that Zaso\u2019s negligence should have been placed before the jury for its determination of comparative fault of the parties. She argues that the amount of restitution should thereafter have been adjusted to account for Zaso\u2019s comparative negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-4\">\u00b632 The problem is that Edward raises this argument for the first time on appeal. In both the Municipal Court at the restitution hearing and on appeal to the District Court, Edward argued that the court lacked the authority to impose <em>any </em>restitution order against her because the offenses of which she was convicted did not state as an element that she actually caused the accident. In other words, she argued that no causal connection existed between her conduct and the claims for restitution. She did not raise the issue of Zaso\u2019s negligence or comparative fault in either court; she does so for the first time on appeal. We generally decline to consider new issues on appeal. <em>State v. Longfellow, </em>2008 MT 343, \u00b6 19, 346 Mont. 286, 194 P.3d 694; <em>State v. West, </em>2008 MT 338, \u00b6 16, 346 Mont. 244, 194 P.3d 683. This fact distinguishes this case from <em>City of Whitefish v. Jentile, </em>2012 MT 185, \u00b6 28, 366 Mont. 94, 285 P.3d 515, in which we concluded that Jentile had raised the negligence of the other party as a defense at the time of the restitution hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-5\">\u00b633  We conclude that the lower courts did not err in awarding restitution to Zaso, and that the award was legal and not an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-6\">\u00b634 <em>Issue Two: Does substantive evidence in the record support the amount of restitution awarded?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b141-7\">\u00b635 At the restitution hearing on December 21, 2010, the Municipal Court ordered Edward to pay $4,148.60 in restitution to Zaso for lost wages, eyeglasses, a copy of the accident report, and mileage costs. The District Court affirmed the award, and Edward appeals on the basis that the record lacks substantive evidence to support the amount. Edward argues that Zaso failed to provide substantial evidence of her employment, hours and salary, and that she lost her job as a result of the accident, among other things.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-8\">\u00b636 Both parties were represented by counsel at the restitution hearing. Counsel for the City of Billings presented evidence in support <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>of the request for restitution. Edward\u2019s counsel did not present any evidence, though she did cross-examine Zaso about some of the evidence and the amounts requested. The Order from the District Court specifically lists the evidence that was admitted at the hearing and which was before the Municipal Court when it decided to award $4,148.60 in restitution.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b142-4\">\u00b637  Under Section 46-18-242, MCA (2009), proof of pecuniary loss may be made either by way of affidavit submitted with the presentence report, or by way of evidence of the victim\u2019s loss at the time of sentencing. Edward cites <em>State v. Coluccio, </em>2009 MT 273, \u00b6 45, 352 Mont. 122, 214 P.3d 1282, <em>overruled in part on other grounds, State v. Kirn, </em>2012 MT 69, \u00b6 8 n. 1, 364 Mont. 356, 274 P.3d 746, for the assertion that assumptions and speculative calculations are insufficient upon which to make findings of fact. The findings of fact in the instant case were based on the evidence presented at the hearing, including Zaso\u2019s sworn testimony. Zaso\u2019s sworn testimony satisfied the statutory requirement and was not based on speculation. We conclude there was sufficient substantive evidence to support the restitution award.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-5\">\u00b638 <em>Issue Three: Were Edward\u2019s constitutional rights to a jury and a fair trial violated?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b142-6\">\u00b639 Edward argues that her fundamental constitutional rights to procedural and substantive due process were violated when she was deprived of her property without a jury determining causation and apportionment, when the City of Billings did not cite Zaso for violating the law, and when the Municipal Court administered <em>the Allen </em>charge. \u00b640 Our conclusion in Issue One is dispositive of these causation and comparative negligence arguments. As reasoned above, the sentencing court was not required to order the jury to determine causation or comparative negligence under the facts and circumstances of this criminal case, whether for the purpose of awarding restitution or to satisfy Edward\u2019s constitutional rights to a jury and a fair trial. Because causation is not an element of Edward\u2019s criminal convictions and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>Edward did not properly preserve the comparative negligence defense, we decline to apply plain error review in this case and on these grounds. Furthermore, a mere assertion that constitutional rights are implicated or that a manifest miscarriage of justice would result if review of the claimed error did not occur is insufficient to implicate the plain error doctrine. <em>Wilson, </em>\u00b6 16. Edward\u2019s claim also rests upon what she calls the State\u2019s \u201carbitrary charging decisions.\u201d It is not up to this Court to determine who should be charged with what violation. We decline to apply plain error review under these circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-4\">\u00b641 After the jury indicated it might be deadlocked, the Municipal Court gave the following instruction:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b143-5\">The judicial process assigns tasks to the various units. It is the task of the witnesses to testify truthfully as they recall the facts. It is the task of the lawyers to prepare the case for final submission to the trier of the facts, the jury. It is the task of the Judge to preside, instruct you as to the law and to rule on the admissibility of the evidence. It is the task of the jury to decide the case. The ultimate responsibility of the jury is to render a verdict in this cause. You are not partisan nor are you advocates in this matter but you are the judges; you are the judges of the facts; it is you and you alone that can render a verdict in this case. There is no reason to believe that any other 6 men and women could possess any more ability, intelligence and courage to do the ultimate task assigned to a jury under the American system of justice.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b143-6\">The final test of the quality of your service will be in the verdict which you return to this Court. It is only by rendering a verdict in this cause that you can make a definite contribution to efficient judicial administration as you arrive at a just and possible verdict. We have never asked, as a matter of fact we have instructed you, that you should not surrender your honest convictions in this matter for the mere purpose of returning a verdict or solely because of the opinion of other jurors, but this does not mean that you should avoid a task assigned to you of rendering a verdict in this cause.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b143-7\">Edward argues that her fundamental constitutional rights to procedural and substantive due process were violated when the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>Municipal Court gave this <em>Allen </em>charge<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> to the jury, as she alleges it was \u201ccoercive and improper\u201d and \u201cencouraged the minority to surrender their convictions to provide a unanimous verdict.\u201d Citing <em>Norquay, </em>Edward argues that providing the instruction led to a manifest miscarriage of justice, as it did not allow the jurors \u201cto hold steadfast to their opinions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b144-4\">\u00b642 Under the plain error doctrine\u2019s two-part test, Edward must show that the alleged error implicates a fundamental right and that failing to review it \u201cmay result in a manifest miscarriage of justice, may leave unsettled the question of the fundamental fairness of the trial or proceedings, or may compromise the integrity of the judicial process.\u201d <em>Wilson, </em>\u00b6 28. Instead, Edward merely asserts that \u201cdynamiting the jury [with the <em>Allen </em>charge] resulted in a conviction where there [otherwise] would have been a hung jury,\u201d and a hung jury would have precluded a restitution hearing. We find insufficient evidence in the record to support this assertion. We have previously stated that \u201ca mere assertion that constitutional rights are implicated or that failure to review the claimed error may result in a manifest miscarriage of justice is insufficient to implicate the plain error doctrine.\u201d <em>State v. Gunderson, </em>2010 MT 166, \u00b6 100, 357 Mont. 142, 237 P.3d 74.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-5\">\u00b643 We have repeatedly upheld application of the <em>Allen </em>charge jury instruction. <em>Norquay, </em>\u00b6 36; <em>see State v. Bieber, </em>2007 MT 262, \u00b6 70, 339 Mont. 309, 170 P.3d 444; <em>State v. Cline, </em>170 Mont. 520, 540, 555 P.2d 724, 736 (1976). Though the language of the instruction was changed in 2011 by <em>Norquay, </em>there is no evidence that the instruction was inappropriately applied at the time it was given, and neither party objected to the court giving the instruction. <em>Norquay, </em>\u00b6 43. Edward did not carry her requisite burden, and we therefore decline to review the application of the <em>Allen </em>charge for plain error.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-6\">\u00b644 <em>Issue Four: Did Edward receive ineffective assistance of counsel? </em>\u00b645 Finally, Edward argues on appeal that her trial counsel provided ineffective assistance by failing to argue that the restitution hearing violated Edward\u2019s rights to due process, a fair trial, and an impartial jury, and that Zaso did not fit the statutory definition of a victim and was therefore not entitled to restitution. In her reply brief, Edward also argues that if this Court finds that Edward did not preserve for appeal the issue of comparative negligence, then her counsel was</p>\n<p id=\"b145-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>ineffective for failing to do so. The State argues that these claims should not be reviewed on direct appeal as they are not record-based. If these claims are reviewed on direct appeal, the State asserts that Edward has neither demonstrated that her counsel was ineffective nor that she was prejudiced by her counsel\u2019s performance.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-4\">\u00b646 We generally address only record-based claims for ineffective assistance of counsel on direct appeal. <em>Herman, </em>\u00b6 15. \u201cA claim is record-based if \u2018the record fully explain[s] <em>why </em>counsel took the particular course of action.\u2019 \u201d <em>Herman, </em>\u00b6 15 (quoting <em>State v. White, </em>2001 MT 149, \u00b6 20, 306 Mont. 58, 30 P.3d 340). \u201c[I]f there is \u2018no plausible justification\u2019 for counsel\u2019s conduct,\u201d we may address a claim that is not record-based on direct appeal, though these situations are \u201crelatively rare.\u201d <em>Herman, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 15-16 (quoting <em>State v. Jefferson, </em>2003 MT 90, \u00b6 50, 315 Mont. 146, 69 P.3d 641; <em>State v. Kougl, </em>2004 MT 243, \u00b6 15, 323 Mont. 6, 97 P.3d 1095).</p>\n<p id=\"b145-5\">\u00b647  Edward\u2019s claim of ineffective assistance of counsel is not record-based, as the record does not explain <em>why </em>Edward\u2019s counsel proceeded in the manner to which Edward objects. Because the crucial question of <em>why </em>is not answered by the record, Edward\u2019s claim is not record-based and thus not appropriate for direct appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-6\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b145-7\">\u00b648 Based on the foregoing, we affirm the Order of the District Court.</p>\n<judges id=\"AU\">JUSTICES RICE, WHEAT, BAKER and MORRIS concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b135-7\"> <em>Allen v.
