We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-10\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b454-11\">1. Legal Background</p>\n<p id=\"b454-12\">\u00b62 The Montana Water Quality Act makes it unlawful to cause pollution of any state waters from a point source without a valid Montana Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (MPDES) permit. Section 75-5-605(2)(c), MCA. Under the MPDES program the Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ) may issue permits for storm water discharges associated with construction activity. Admin. R. M. 17.30.1105 (2008). Storm water discharge associated with construction activity is a discharge of storm water runoff, snow melt runoff, or surface runoff and drainage into state waters as a result of construction activities including clearing, grading, and excavation that result in the disturbance of an acre or more of total land area. Admin. R. M. 17.30.1102(27), (28) (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b454-13\">\u00b63 Any person who discharges or proposes to discharge storm water associated with construction activity must obtain either an individual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>permit or a general permit. Admin. R. M. 17.30.1105(l)(a); <em>See also </em>Admin. R. M. 17.30.1341(l)(j) (2008). In order to operate under an individual permit, a person must submit a detailed application, including analysis of the proposed discharge and site-specific controls to ensure the discharge will not violate water quality standards. Admin. R. M. 17.30.1322 (2008). Whereas to operate under a general permit for storm water discharge associated with a construction activity, a person must only submit a notice of intent together with a pollution control plan. Admin. R. M. 17.30.1115 (2008). In place of the detailed site-specific controls provided by an individual permit, a general permit requires only that a storm water discharger follow standard best management practices (BMPs) that DEQ has found generally sufficient to meet water quality standards across the state. Admin. R. M. 17.30.1115.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-4\">\u00b64 However, DEQ may not issue a general permit if the \u201cpoint source will be located in an area of unique ecological or recreational significance.\u201d Admin. R. M. 17.30.1341(4)(e). The determination of whether an area is of unique ecological or recreational significance is based upon considerations of Montana stream classifications, impacts on fishery resources, local conditions at proposed discharge sites, and designations of wilderness areas or of wild and scenic rivers. Admin. R. M. 17.30.1341(4)(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b455-5\">2. Factual and Procedural Background</p>\n<p id=\"AFZ\">\u00b65 The Rock Creek Mine was initially proposed in the late 1980s with the goal of extracting copper and silver from the Cabinet Mountains. After the mine was initially proposed, various state and federal agencies spent more than a decade examining the potential impacts that the mine would have on the surrounding environment, including Rock Creek, the lower Clark Fork River, and the adjacent Cabinet Wilderness Area. This review culminated in September 2001 when DEQ and the U.S. Forest Service issued a final draft of a joint Environmental Impact Statement (EIS).</p>\n<p id=\"b455-6\">\u00b66 As described in the EIS, the mine would be developed in two phases. In the first phase, the exploration phase, Revett would drill an 18-foot wide, 1.25 mile long, evaluation adit, or mine shaft, to reach the ore body. The adit would generate substantial volumes of waste rock and ore. In the second phase, the production phase, Revett would drill parallel tunnels beginning at the confluence of the east and west forks of Rock Creek and extending some three miles beneath the Cabinet Mountains. Revett would then begin excavating the mine at a rate of approximately 10,000 tons of ore per day for an estimated 30 years.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>\u00b67 The majority of the infrastructure associated with the mine will be constructed in the Rock Creek watershed. Rock Creek has two major branches, the East Fork and the West Fork, and is itself a tributary of the Clark Fork River near Noxon, Montana. The evaluation adit is located up the West Fork of Rock Creek, and the excavation tunnels are located at the confluence of the East and West Forks. Revett also plans to construct a milling facility at the confluence. Access to the milling site is provided by Forest Service road 150 and a combination of Forest Service roads 150 and 2741 provide access to the evaluation adit site. Forest Service road 150 parallels Rock Creek, and upstream from the confluence it parallels the West Fork of Rock Creek. Road 2741 branches off of Forest Service road 150 and extends nearly to the evaluation adit site. In order to use these roads, the EIS notes that Revett would need to improve them. This would include, among other things, road widening, installing turnouts, and corner widening.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-4\">\u00b68 Together, Rock Creek and its forks support an important population of bull trout, <em>Salvelinus confluentus. </em>Although previously abundant in western Montana, bull trout populations had dwindled and in 1998 the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) listed them as threatened in the Columbia River Basin, which includes the Clark Fork River basin and Rock Creek. 63 Fed. Reg. 31647 (June 10,1998); 50 C.F.R. \u00a7 17.11(h) (2008). After bull trout were listed as threatened, the Forest Service, as required by Section 7 of the Endangered Species Act (ESA), formally consulted with the USFWS about the mine\u2019s effect on bull trout. The USFWS then released a formal biological opinion (BiOp) regarding the mine\u2019s effects on bull trout in 2000. The USFWS revised and supplemented its findings in succeeding BiOps released in 2003,2006 and 2007. In the 2007 supplement, the USFWS issued a no jeopardy finding and concluded that the development of the mine would not jeopardize the existence of bull trout in the Lower Clark Fork area. Significantly, the agency did not make an explicit finding as to jeopardy to the Rock Creek population of bull trout. <em>Rock Creek Alliance v. United States Forest Serv., </em>703 F. Supp. 2d 1152, 1200 (D. Mont. 2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b456-5\">\u00b69 Rock Creek is one of only two tributaries, the other being Bull River, that support bull trout populations in the drainage of Cabinet Gorge Reservoir. According to the Montana Department of Fish, Wildlife and Parks (FWP), the Rock Creek and Bull River populations are the only two stocks in the surrounding area that have enough individuals to avoid a significant risk of extinction. Of these two, the Rock Creek stock is \u201cconsidered unique (relative to Bull River)... [and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>it] is unlikely that bull trout would quickly recolonize Rock Creek if they became extirpated there.\u201d In the final EIS, DEQ and the Forest Service similarly concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b457-4\">Rock Creek is an <em>essential stock </em>for conservation purposes. Not only is the species more abundant than elsewhere locally, but Rock Creek is also in better condition physically. Given that these data also show that Rock Creek is well within the range of conditions preferred by the species, while most other streams are not, we support the findings of the State of Montana that <em>Rock Creek is one of the two watersheds where conservation efforts should focus on recovery of the migratory hull trout.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b457-5\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b457-6\">\u00b610 Despite the importance of Rock Creek, habitat conditions for bull trout in Rock Creek are already on the edge because of past sediment deposition in the creek. Excessive sediment destroys bull trout\u2019s preferred spawning habitat of low gradient reaches of mountain valley streams with clean gravel and cobbly substrate. Fine sediments clog the spaces between the gravel and cobble needed by incubating eggs and fry. If sediment is deposited into interstitial spaces during incubation, it impedes water movement through the gravel, lowers the levels of dissolved oxygen, and inhibits the removal of metabolic waste. Even if an embryo incubates and develops successfully, the emerging fry can be entombed by the sediment. Juvenile and adult bull trout are also adversely affected.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-7\">\u00b611 Due to the already at-risk status of Rock Creek, any additional sediment deposition could threaten its bull trout population. In the 2000 BiOp, the USFWS concluded that \u201c[a]ny increase in sediment deposition is a risk to bull trout habitat productivity and survival rate.\u201d Similarly, FWP stated, \u201cAdditional impacts [from an increase in sediment] could result in irreversible consequences.\u201d These consequences are particularly troublesome because, as noted by the Forest Service and DEQ, \u201cthe loss of Rock Creek as a spawning and rearing tributary could push the bull trout further towards elimination in this drainage.\u201d And, once eliminated, it is unlikely that bull trout would quickly recolonize the creek.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-8\">\u00b612 In light of the bull trout\u2019s precarious state, any action by Revett that results in sediment being deposited in Rock Creek could potentially extirpate bull trout from the Creek. Herein lays the potential problem for Revett, construction related to Phase I of the mine-in particular road improvements-will likely lead to a discharge of sediment to the West Fork of Rock Creek for several years. The USFWS, in the 2007 supplemental BiOp, states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b458-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>The most obvious direct impact of the construction and operation of the Rock Creek Mine to bull trout is the potential for an increased level of fine sediment entering the stream <em>during the 5-year </em>construction phase. Activities associated with the development of the mine include <em>road construction, road reconstruction, bridge and culvert replacement </em>[and] <em>alteration of existing roads </em>to conform to Best Management Practices (BMPs), and construction and development of tailings ponds, adit and mill sites, powerlines, and pipelines.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b458-4\">(Emphasis added.) Continuing, the BiOp notes that this increase in sediment levels \u201ccould reach a level to cause morphological channel changes (e.g., filling of pools, substrate embeddedness) that reduce the quality of rearing and foraging habitat for bull trout. During this same period, degradation in the quality of spawning habitat is likely due to deposits of fine sediment in spawning gravels.\u201d As a result, the USFWS concluded that increases in sedimentation \u201care anticipated to adversely affect and likely result in a take of the egg, larval and juvenile life history stages by harming or impairing feeding, breeding and sheltering patterns of adult and juvenile bull trout.\u201d Similarly, FWP concluded that the high levels of sediment input during the initial phase of the mine may \u201cresult in permanent loss of the Rock Creek bull trout stock.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b458-5\">\u00b613 In order to avoid these potentially disastrous consequences, the Forest Service and DEQ plan requires Revett to undertake BMPs to avoid sediment deposition. However, the Forest Service and DEQ admit that, even if Revett utilizes BMPs, bull trout in Rock Creek will be adversely affected because of \u201cunavoidable fugitive sediment loading during project construction.\u201d The 2007 BiOp also notes that during construction, short-term increases in sediment are unavoidable. This is because construction of the mitigation measures themselves will result in short-term increases in sediment and because the BMPs are less than 100 percent effective.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-6\">\u00b614 Prior to reconstructing the Forest Service roads, and increasing sediment deposition in Rock Creek, Revett submitted a Notice of Intent (NOI) to DEQ requesting approval to discharge sediment to Rock Creek for Phase I construction activities including:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b458-7\">road improvements to the existing unpaved [Forest Service] access roads to the adit site, road widening at a number of identified locations to improve safety and access, borrow material sites adj acent to the access road, installation of a buried powerline and water pipeline in the access road, installation of arch culverts at three locations[,] road surfacing to reduce sediment yield from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>the road surface, installation of rolling dips as required by the [Forest Service],... and construction of an infiltration pond system for discharge of treated adit (mine) water to groundwater.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b459-6\">Revett sought approval -under the General Permit for Storm Water Discharges Associated with Construction activity, also known as General Permit MTR 100000. As required by \u00a7 75-5-401(c), MCA, Revett submitted stormwater pollution prevention plan with its NOI. On August 22, 2008, DEQ approved the NOI and pollution prevention plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-7\">\u00b615 The Plaintiffs, in anticipation of Revett seeking approval for mine-related construction under General Permit MTR 100000, filed this action against DEQ on June 9, 2008. Revett subsequently intervened as a defendant. In the complaint, the Plaintiffs sought a declaratory judgment that use of general permits to approve stormwater runoff from the Rock Creek Mine would violate Admin. R. M. 17.30.1341(4)(e) because Rock Creek is an area of \u201cunique ecological significance\u201d based on considerations of impacts on fishery resource and local conditions at proposed discharge. On July 21, 2011, the District Court granted summary judgment to the Plaintiffs and declared the general permit void. The court found that DEQ\u2019s approval of discharges associated with road,reconstruction violated Admin. R. M. 14.30.1341(4)(e) because Rock Creek is of \u201cunique ecological significance because of its impacts on fishery resources and local conditions at the proposed discharge site.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b459-8\">\u00b616 Revett appeals, and raises the following issue:</p>\n<p id=\"b459-9\">\u00b617 <em>Did the District Court err when it granted summary judgment to the </em>Plaintiffs?</p>\n<p id=\"b459-10\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b459-11\">\u00b618 We review a district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment de novo, applying the same criteria as the district court. <em>N. Cheyenne Tribe v. Mont. Dep\u2019t of Envtl. Quality, </em>2010 MT 111, \u00b6 18, 356 Mont. 296, 234 P.3d 51. A district court properly grants summary judgment only when no genuine issues of material fact exist and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. <em>N. Cheyenne Tribe, </em>\u00b6 18.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-12\">\u00b6 19 An agency\u2019s interpretation of its rule is afforded great weight, and we will defer to that interpretation unless it is plainly inconsistent with the spirit of the rule. <em>Clark Fork Coalition v. Dep\u2019t of Envtl. Quality, </em>2008 MT 407, \u00b6 20, 347 Mont. 197, 197 P.3d 482. We will sustain an agency\u2019s interpretation of a rule so long as it lies within the range of reasonable interpretation permitted by the wording. <em>Clark Fork Coalition, </em>\u00b6 20. Of course, we need not defer to an incorrect <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>agency interpretation. <em>Clark Fork Coalition, </em>\u00b6 20.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-4\">\u00b620  We review an agency decision not classified as a contested case under the Montana Administrative Procedure Act to determine whether the decision was arbitrary, capricious, unlawful or not supported by substantial law. <em>Clark Fork Coalition, </em>\u00b6 21. In reviewing an agency decision under the arbitrary and capricious standard, we consider whether the decision was \u201cbased on a consideration of the relevant factors and whether there has been a clear error of judgment.\u201d <em>N. Fork Preservation Ass\u2019n v. Dep\u2019t of State Lands, </em>238 Mont. 451, 465, 778 P.2d 862, 871 (1989) (citing <em>Marsh v. Oregon Natural Resources Council, </em>490 U.S. 360, 378, 109 S. Ct. 1851, 1861 (1989)). Although our review of agency decisions is narrow, we will not automatically defer to the agency \u2018 \u201cwithout carefully reviewing the record and satisfying [ourselves] that the agency has made a reasoned decision ....\u2019\u201d <em>Friends of the Wild Swan v. Department of Natural Res. &amp; Conservation, </em>2000 MT 209, \u00b6 28, 301 Mont. 1, 6 P.3d 972 <em>(quoting Marsh, </em>490 U.S. at 378, 109 S. Ct. at 1861).</p>\n<p id=\"b460-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b460-6\">\u00b621 As a preliminary matter, Revett argues that the District Court failed to defer to DEQ\u2019s expertise in the area of water quality and permitting activities. However, since we review a district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment de novo, and we defer to an agency\u2019s interpretation of its own rule, it is immaterial whether the District Court deferred to the DEQ.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-7\">\u00b622 Revett also argues as a threshold matter that the District Court failed to set forth the facts or grounds that support its decision such that meaningful appellate review can be made. <em>See Johnston v. American Reliable Ins. Co., </em>248 Mont. 227, 229, 810 P.2d 1189, 1191 (1991). To the contrary, the District Court made clear that it determined Rock Creek was an area of \u201cunique ecological significance\u201d based on the impacts on fishery resources and local conditions at the discharge site. It set forth specific facts from the 2007 Supplement BiOp in support of its position. Accordingly, the District Court did not err.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-8\">\u00b623 The remainder of Revett\u2019s appeal focuses on the District Court\u2019s conclusion that because Rock Creek is an area of unique ecological significance, the general permit approval issued by DEQ is void. Revett contends that the mere presence of bull trout alone is not sufficient to justify the conclusion that Rock Creek is an area of unique ecological significance because the USFWS issued a no jeopardy finding in its BiOp for the project, meaning that the project would not endanger bull <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>trout as a species. Revett additionally argues that the implementation of BMPs during road construction would limit sediment deposition, and over the life of the mine would eventually decrease sediment loads in Rock Creek.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-4\">\u00b624 The plaintiffs argue that Rock Creek is of unique ecological significance because, as the District Court concluded, the fishery itself is unique and bull trout habitat conditions are already on the edge. \u00b625  DEQ may not approve the use of a general permit in an area of unique ecological significance. Admin. R. M. 17.30.1341(4)(e). To determine whether an area is of unique ecological significance DEQ must take into consideration Montana Stream classifications, impacts on fishery resources, local conditions at the proposed discharge site, and designations of wilderness area or of wild and scenic rivers. Admin. R. M. 17.30.1341(4)(e). The District Court relied exclusively on considerations of the impacts on fishery resources and the local conditions at the proposed discharge sites to find that Rock Creek is an area of unique ecological significance.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-5\">\u00b626 Rock Creek\u2019s fishery resource is by all accounts a unique resource. In the final EIS, DEQ described Rock Creek\u2019s bull trout population as \u201can essential stock for conservation purposes,\u201d and that it is the stronger of the \u201conly two stocks in the Lower Clark Fork considered to have enough individuals to avoid significant risk of extinction.\u201d Compared to the only other such stock, the \u201cRock Creek stock is considered unique.\u201d Though the Rock Creek stock may be at risk of extirpation, and has a limited population of adfluvial bull trout, DEQ specifically noted that Rock Creek is an area \u201cwhere conservation efforts should focus on recovery of the migratory bull trout.\u201d Thus, it is not the mere presence of bull trout, as argued by Revett, that make Rock Creek unique, but instead it is this specific population of bull trout, and the possibility of recovery of an adfluvial population of bull trout that make Rock Creek a unique fishery resource.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-6\">\u00b627 In addition, considerations of \u201cconditions at the proposed discharge site\u201d warrant a conclusion that the area is of unique ecological significance. Presently, Rock Creek is already loaded with sediments and as a result, FWP has warned that \u201chabitat conditions are already on the edge\u201d and \u201c[a]dditional impacts could result in irreversible consequences.\u201d The USFWS has similarly concluded that \u201cany increase in sediment deposition is a risk to bull trout habitat productivity and survival rate.\u201d This is particularly troublesome because, as noted in the final EIS, \u201cthe loss of Rock Creek as a spawning and rearing tributary could push the bull trout further towards elimination in [the] drainage.\u201d The risk of extirpation of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>unique population of already at-risk bull trout further justifies the finding that Rock Creek is an area of unique ecological significance. \u00b628 Revett argues that the implementation of BMPs will minimize any risk to bull trout in the short term and that in the long term, road reconstruction will ultimately benefit bull trout. Even with the implementation of BMPs-which will not eliminate sediment loading entirely-the \u201chabitat impacts caused by an increase in sediment loading ... would occur sometime during the first five years when site disturbance is greatest due to <em>construction of roads </em>and facility development.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Moreover, FWP and the USFWS have predicted that road reconstruction and implementation of BMPs will result in further sedimentation of Rock Creek and may result in the permanent loss of bull trout, making it irrelevant that sediment loading will be reduced at the end of the project.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-4\">\u00b629  Accordingly, we conclude that DEQ\u2019s approval of the use of General Permit MTR 100000 to allow storm water discharges was arbitrary and capricious because DEQ failed to consider the relevant factors set forth in the law prior to its decision, and as a result, committed a clear error of judgment. Because DEQs interpretation was incorrect, we owe their interpretation of Admin. R. M. 17.30.1341(4)(e) no deference.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-5\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b462-6\">\u00b630 For the reasons stated above, we affirm the District Court\u2019s grant of summary judgment to the Plaintiffs.</p>\n<judges id=\"b462-7\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES NELSON and MORRIS concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b462-8\">JUSTICE RICE,</author>\n<p id=\"Akr\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-9\">\u00b631 I believe the Court has incorrectly stated and applied the standards of review and conducted an analysis which is contrary to the correct standards.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-10\">\u00b632 The Court holds, without citation to authority, that it is \u201cimmaterial\u201d whether the District Court failed to defer to DEQ\u2019s interpretation of its administrative rule, and failed to defer to DEQ\u2019s expertise in the subject matter, because this Court exercises de novo review in summary judgment matters. Opinion, \u00b6 21. In effect, the Court holds that the standards applied by the District Court simply don\u2019t matter, because in the end this Court can cure any errors by giving necessary deference to the agency when conducting de novo review. I submit that this rendering of our review standards is flawed and will cause problems in future cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-11\">\u00b633 While it is technically true that the District Court decided this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>case by summary judgment, that was done largely as a matter of nomenclature. This is not the typical litigation case where the evidentiary record is developed in discovery. The trial court was not called on to determine whether the evidence demonstrated material factual conflicts. Rather, the evidentiary record-here, a massive one-was compiled before DEQ, which applied its expertise to that record. Consequently, we have held that in such cases that a court\u2019s standards of review are narrow-narrower, in my view, than the Court\u2019s opinion evidences.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-4\">\u00b634 We have explained that, in these cases, \u201cour standard of review is limited to whether the agency erred in law or whether its decision is wholly unsupported by the evidence or clearly arbitrary or capricious.\u201d <em>Winchell v. Mont. Dep\u2019t of Nat. Resources &amp; Conserv., </em>1999 MT 11, \u00b6 11, 293 Mont. 89, 972 P.2d 1132. \u201c[W]e only inquire insofar as to ascertain if the agency has stayed within its statutory bounds and has not acted arbitrarily, capriciously, or unlawfully.\u201d <em>Winchell, </em>\u00b6 11. Further, \u201c[w]e afford <em>great deference </em>to agency decisions, especially where it implicates substantial agency expertise.\u201d <em>Winchell, </em>\u00b6 11 (emphasis added). \u201cIn reviewing an agency decision to determine if it survives the arbitrary and capricious standard, we consider whether the decision was \u2018based on a consideration of the relevant factors and whether there has been a clear error of judgment.\u2019\u201d <em>Clark Fork Coalition, </em>\u00b6 21 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b463-5\">\u00b635 A district court\u2019s failure to properly apply these standards is legal error which this Court must determine how to remedy. Such error must either be reversed, as in <em>Clark Fork Coalition, </em>\u00b6 50, or must be remedied by a determination that the case can be affirmed in spite of the error, as in <em>Winchell, </em>\u00b6 12. We do not have the option of dismissing a district court\u2019s erroneous application of the standards of review as \u201cimmaterial.\u201d Opinion, f 21. A district court\u2019s error in the application of the standards commonly leads to an incorrect result, which improperly shifts the burden of demonstrating error on appeal to the wrong party. That is particularly prejudicial in a case that involves a massive evidentiary record and complicated issues, as here. This Court must enforce the proper application of all the standards of review by the district courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-6\">\u00b636 Turning to the basis of the Court\u2019s decision, the Court concludes that DEQ\u2019s approval of the General Permit \u201cwas arbitrary and capricious because DEQ failed to consider the relevant factors\u201d and \u201ccommitted a clear error of judgment.\u201d Opinion, \u00b6 29. This conclusion is premised on the Court\u2019s factual summary of the case. However, the Court\u2019s summary of the case is the Court\u2019s own story-a story based on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>a very selective review of the evidentiary record and one that is contrary to the record as a whole. The Court\u2019s selective review leads to the conclusion that DEQ \u201cfailed to consider the relevant factors,\u201d Opinion, \u00b6 29, but this conclusion is unsupportable from a proper review of the full record. Indeed, DEQ carefully considered and addressed all of the required factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-4\">\u00b637 The Court reasons that DEQ erred by failing to designate the Rock Creek discharge area as one of \u201cunique ecological significance,\u201d which in turn is based on two primary factual conclusions: 1) the discharge of sediment from road improvements, which the Court characterizes as the \u201cproblem for Revett\u201d; and 2) what the Court describes as the \u201cprecarious state\u201d of the bull trout population. <em>See </em>Opinion, \u00b6 12.1 will address each of these factual issues and then turn to the legal issue of the determination of \u201cunique ecological significance.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b464-5\">\u00b638 Regarding discharge of sediment from road construction, the Court first fails to understand the current state of road sediment discharge. The area of the proposed mine has been logged since the late 1800\u2019s and has a patchwork of old clear cuts connected by dirt roads, including the old Forest Service road which will serve as Revett\u2019s access road. These historic logging roads have not been properly maintained and are <em>currently </em>causing excessive discharge of sediment into Rock Creek, at no fault of Revett. It is estimated that 379 tons of sediment are <em>currently </em>being discharged annually into Rock Creek, with corresponding current impact on trout populations. It is estimated that, if unmitigated, Revett\u2019s activities could increase the discharge of sediment into Rock Creek by 1,415 tons per year. Thus, mitigation has always been a necessity. The post-EIS Record of Decision by DEQ and the U.S. Forest Service imposed a mitigation requirement under which Revett would decrease sediment discharge by 1,430.4 tons annually-not only mitigating all of its own discharge, but also reducing the <em>current </em>discharge by 15.4 tons annually. Then, Revett\u2019s actual plan, submitted in response to the imposition of the mitigation requirement, proposed to further mitigate by decreasing annual sediment discharge by an additional 39.5 tons, and thus Revett\u2019s project is anticipated to reduce <em>current </em>discharge by a total of 54.9 tons annually.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-6\">\u00b639 A question raised about the process of implementing this plan was whether Revett\u2019s road construction activity would temporarily increase sediment discharge before full mitigation was in effect. To address this concern, and to ensure that reality comports with the above estimates of sediment discharge, Revett has been required, before beginning and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>throughout the project, to conduct extensive monitoring of Rock Creek substrate composition, fine sediment levels, and fish population, and to report these results to the agencies. The agencies concluded that this monitoring and mitigation plan \u201cwould offset project effects concurrent with construction\u201d and that \u201cthere would be no net short-term increase\u201d in sediment discharge during the project. The USFWS added that \u201c[t]he effect of sediment intrusion into the stream channel should be minimized\u201d by these abatement measures.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"ATqh\">\u00b640 On the second factual issue, the bull trout analysis is significantly informed by the USFWS\u2019s jeopardy determination. That agency analyzes these questions by geographic area. The Clark Fork River Management Unit is one of 23 geographic units within the Columbia River Recovery region. The Lower Clark Fork Core Area is one of 35 areas within the Clark Fork Unit. The Rock Creek Local Population is one of 14 populations within the Lower Clark Fork Core Area.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-4\">\u00b641 In making its jeopardy determination concerning the small population, in both numbers and size, of the Rock Creek bull trout, the USFWS evaluated the stability of the 14 local populations of bull trout in the Lower Clark Fork Core Area. The USFWS determined that 80 to 90 percent of adfluvial, migratory bull trout in the Core Area are provided by populations which would not be impacted by the project. The USFWS commented that \u201cRock Creek bull trout are mainly resident fish and contribute relatively little to the Lower Clark Fork Core Area population because they are functionally isolated from the Lake Pend Oreille system (i.e., non-migratory) and have low reproductive potential\u201d and, in any event, Rock Creek is \u201cchronically dewatered\u201d much of the year, foreclosing passage for all bull trout.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The USFWS\u2019s 2006 report concluded that the mining project was not likely to jeopardize the continued existence of bull trout in the Lower Clark Fork Core Area but that adverse impacts to individual bull trout were likely. Thus, as with the sediment issue, mitigation was required. The mitigation measures imposed by the USFWS were in addition to the sediment mitigation measures required by DEQ and the Forest <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>Service, specifying various \u201creasonable and prudent measures\u201d to minimize harm to individual bull trout.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-4\">\u00b642 In consideration of these mitigation efforts, the EIS concluded that the plan for the project (known as \u201cAlternative V\u201d) \u201cnow includes protection and mitigation measures needed to support the bull trout recovery effort and protect all forms of the species.\u201d The agencies observed that the risk of adverse effects to bull trout under Alternative V was \u201cminor\u201d and only marginally greater than not constructing the mine at all, and that was only because, in operating a mine, the risk of human error could not be eliminated. Regarding the entire Phase II construction and operation of the mine, the USFWS concluded that any impact on bull trout would be diminutive and not likely to have an appreciable effect. The EIS concluded that \u201cAlternative V now protects the Rock Creek bull trout subpopulation\u201d during initial construction, and that mitigation actually provided a \u201chigh likelihood\u201d of an \u201cimproving trend in aquatic resources over the life of the project.\u201d As noted by the Court, in 2007 the USFWS issued a supplement that found that the mine would not jeopardize bull trout. Opinion, \u00b6 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-5\">\u00b643 This discussion of the evidence is not meant to refute the Court\u2019s version of the record-that\u2019s not the point. The point is that the limited standard of review in this case requires that courts determine whether the agency\u2019s decision is \u201cwholly unsupported by the evidence,\u201d or was arbitrary and capricious. Clearly, there was considerable evidence to support DEQ\u2019s grant of the permit-evidence which the Court chooses not to consider and it cannot credibly be said that DEQ\u2019s decision was \u201cwholly unsupported by the evidence.\u201d I now turn to the legal issue of DEQ\u2019s determination that the Rock Creek area was not one of \u201cunique ecological significance\u201d under the governing regulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-6\">\u00b644 The Court appears to reach a lay fisherman\u2019s conclusion about Rock Creek\u2019s \u201cuniqueness\u201d instead of applying the governing legal principles. The regulation provides that DEQ may deny a permit if:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AVd\">(e) the point source will be located in an area of unique ecological or recreational significance. <em>Such determination must be based upon considerations of Montana stream classifications adopted under 75-5-301, MCA, impacts on fishery resources, local conditions at proposed discharge sites, and designations of wilderness areas under 16 USC 1132 or of wild and scenic rivers under 16 USC 1274.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b466-7\">Admin. R. M. 17.30.1341(4)(e). (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b466-8\">\u00b645 First, pursuant to the cross-referenced \u00a7 75-5-301, MCA, entitled \u201cClassifications and standards for state waters,\u201d Rock Creek is classified as a B-l river, the same class as a majority of Montana\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>streams and rivers. Given the numerous streams in Montana so classified, this does not give any uniqueness to Rock Creek. Rather, Montana rivers which are recognized for their unique ecological significance are classified as \u201cOutstanding Resource Waters.\u201d <em>See </em>\u00a7\u00a7 75-5-315; -316, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-4\">\u00b646 Pursuant to the cross-referenced federal statutes, the Rock Creek area is not in a designated wilderness area and Rock Creek is not designated as a wild and scenic area. Consequently, the Court must look to the more general \u201cimpacts on fishery resources\u201d and \u201clocal conditions at proposed discharge sites\u201d in order to conclude the site is ecologically significant.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-5\">\u00b647 However, in addition to the evidence already discussed, there is abundant further evidence in the record that the bull trout population and habitat of this area is not in any way \u201cunique.\u201d According to the USFWS, the Rock Creek bull trout population is but one of 150 local bull trout populations in the Clark Fork River Management Unit and one of 14 local populations in the Lower Clark Fork Core Area. The USFWS explained that the populations in Rock Creek (7.1 miles) are a small part of the population in the Bull River (35.3 miles) and a very small part of the <em>3,372 miles </em>of bull trout habitat in the Clark Fork River Management Unit. In fact, the USFWS essentially concluded that wiping out the entire Rock Creek population would not impact the health of the bull trout in the Lower Clark Fork Core Area-but proposed mitigation efforts would avoid that and would even go so far as to mitigate impacts to individual bull trout. Further, as discussed above, the mitigation efforts, including monitoring of sediment levels and fish populations, and the reduction of current sediment discharge, would not only ensure protection of existing resources, but would serve to enhance them. There is nothing unique about the bull trout habitat in this particular area, but even if there was, the mitigation efforts will actually serve to improve trout habitat, even during the construction phase.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-6\">\u00b648 The duty of the courts in applying the arbitrary and capricious standard is to determine whether the agency\u2019s decision was \u201cbased on a consideration of the relevant factors and whether there has been a clear error of judgment.\u201d <em>Clark Fork Coalition, </em>\u00b6 21 (citation omitted). Further, we defer to an agency\u2019s interpretation of its regulation, <em>Clark Fork Coalition, </em>\u00b6 20, and in cases such as this one, \u201c[w]e afford <em>great deference </em>to agency decisions, especially where it implicates substantial agency expertise,\u201d <em>Winchell, </em>\u00b6 11 (emphasis added). Clearly, DEQ engaged in a careful review of all the necessary factors and made a judgment well supported by the record in a complicated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>matter which heavily implicated its expertise. Its judgment was reasonable and was not a \u201cclear error.\u201d It is not the duty of this Court to second guess the agency about the record or to substitute its judgment for the agency. However, by relying primarily on the 2000-2001 Biological Opinion and the 2007 supplemental Biological Opinion issued by the USFWS to the exclusion of the vast majority of the abundant evidence available to DEQ, it appears the Court has done exactly that.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-4\">\u00b649 The District Court concluded that \u201cthe spirit\u201d of the regulation required a finding that Rock Creek was of unique ecological significance. The District Court failed to consider vast portions of the record. Citing to a few pieces of the record, the District Court substituted its judgment for the agency. This Court has done the same and has failed to properly apply the governing standards.
