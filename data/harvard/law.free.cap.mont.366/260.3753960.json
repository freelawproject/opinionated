The District Court designated Thompson a persistent felony offender (PFO) and committed him to the Department of Corrections (DOC) for the statutory minimum period of five years.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-4\">\u00b62 We review the following issues on appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b287-5\">\u00b63 <em>Whether the District Court properly excluded evidence that the complaining witness had a history of a felony forgery charge over a decade before Thompson\u2019s trial.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b287-6\">\u00b64 <em>Whether the District Court imposed a legal sentence when it sentenced Thompson to a five-year commitment to the DOC.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b287-7\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b287-8\">\u00b65 Thompson and Debbie Love (Love) were in a relationship for five years. They went gambling at casinos in Billings, Montana, on December 20, 2010. Thompson\u2019s ex-girlfriend also happened to be at one of the casinos. Thompson left abruptly after Love questioned the presence of Thompson\u2019s ex-girlfriend at the casino.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-9\">\u00b66 Love and Thompson returned to Love\u2019s house. Thompson refused to talk about his ex-girlfriend. Thompson instead tried to initiate sex with Love. Love did not want to have sex with Thompson. As a result, Thompson held Love down and punched her repeatedly. Love asked Thompson why he would beat her if he loved her. Thompson stopped punching Love.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-10\">\u00b67 Love went to the bathroom to assess her wounds. She discovered that she had a bloody nose and that her face was swollen. Love cleaned up and returned to sleep in the same bed as Thompson. Love told Thompson that she would make breakfast when they woke up the next morning. Love called 911 while noisily washing dishes to prevent Thompson from hearing the telephone call.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-11\">\u00b68 Police officers arrived at Love\u2019s residence on the morning of December 21, 2010. Officers photographed Love\u2019s face and noticed bruising and other injuries. The officers arrested Thompson and took him to the police station.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-12\">\u00b69 The State charged Thompson with felony partner or family member assault in violation of \u00a7 45-5-206, MCA. The State timely filed notice of its intent to request Thompson\u2019s designation as a PFO. Thompson filed several pretrial evidentiary motions. One motion requested judicial notice of the court records related to Love\u2019s felony forgery charge from 2000.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-13\">\u00b610 The District Court ruled that Thompson could not question Love <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>regarding her former felony forgery charge due to its remoteness in time. The State had charged Love with forgery more than 10 years before it filed the charges against Thompson. The court further noted that the State had dismissed the forgery charge pursuant to a pretrial diversion agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-4\">\u00b611 The jury returned a unanimous guilty verdict at the end of the trial. Thompson filed a sentencing memorandum in which he argued that \u00a7 46-18-502, MCA, did not require the court to sentence Thompson to the five-year minimum sentence mandated for a PFO. Thompson suggested that the exception to the five-year minimum contained in \u00a7 46-18-222(5), MCA, applied to him. Thompson argued that this exception authorized the court to consider a lesser sentence. The State disagreed.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-5\">\u00b612 The court held a sentencing hearing on September 23, 2011. Thompson requested a three-year DOC commitment with all of the years suspended. The District Court determined that Thompson\u2019s PFO status and the threat that he posed to the community supported its decision to impose the full five-year DOC commitment. Thompson appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-6\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b288-7\">\u00b613 We review for abuse of discretion a district court\u2019s evidentiary rulings. <em>State v. Norquay, </em>2011 MT 34, \u00b6 13, 359 Mont. 257, 248 P.3d 817. A district court abuses its discretion if it acts arbitrarily without conscientious judgment or exceeds the bounds of reason, resulting in a substantial injustice. <em>In re Estate of Hannum, </em>2012 MT 171, \u00b6 18, 366 Mont. 1, 285 P.3d 463. We review for legality only a criminal sentence that imposes more than one year of incarceration. <em>State v. Habets, </em>2011 MT 275, \u00b6 12, 362 Mont. 406, 264 P.3d 1139.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-8\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b288-9\">\u00b614 <em>Whether the District Court properly excluded evidence that the complaining witness had a history of a felony forgery charge over a decade before Thompson\u2019s trial.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b288-10\">\u00b615 Thompson argues that the District Court denied him the right to present a complete and full defense when it excluded evidence of Love\u2019s decade-old felony forgery charge and pre-trial diversion agreement. A district court possesses discretion to exclude evidence of a person\u2019s character for the purpose of proving an action in conformity therewith. M. R. Evid. 404(a). The District Court cited M. R. Evid. 608(b) to support its decision to exclude evidence of Love\u2019s 2000 felony <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>forgery charge. M. R. Evid. 608(b) provides that a court possesses the discretion whether to admit specific instances of conduct to show a witness\u2019s credibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-4\">\u00b616 This Court recognizes that forgery indicates dishonesty. <em>State v. Martin, </em>279 Mont. 185, 200, 926 P.2d 1380, 1390 (1996). Thompson points to our decision in <em>State v. Maier, </em>1999 MT 51, 293 Mont. 403, 977 P.2d 298, in which this Court determined that a district court improperly had excluded evidence of a witness\u2019s juvenile forgery conviction. The Court determined that the specific conduct that surrounded the witness\u2019s forgery conviction \u201cwas probative\u201d of the witness\u2019s character for truthfulness or untruthfulness under M. R. Evid. 608(b). <em>Maier, </em>\u00b6 55. The Court nevertheless affirmed Maier\u2019s conviction in light of the substantial evidence from which the jury could have concluded that Maier had been the shooter. <em>Maier, </em>\u00b6 56. The Court did not address, however, whether M. R. Evid. 608(b) allowed a district court to balance other factors to determine admissibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-5\">\u00b617 The State merely charged Love with forgery. No jury ever had convicted Love of forgery. Love entered a pretrial diversion program. The District Court assessed these extenuating circumstances and the time that had elapsed between her charge in 2000 and the trial in 2011. The court concluded that a decade constituted too much time between the alleged offense and Love\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-6\">\u00b618 Exclusionary rules do not reduce a defendant\u2019s right to present a defense so long as the rules are not arbitrary or disproportionate to their purpose. <em>State v. Johnson, </em>1998 MT 107, \u00b6 22, 288 Mont. 513, 958 P.2d 1182. The court allowed Thompson to present evidence to attack Love\u2019s credibility. Thompson presented recordings of phone calls from Love in which Love insinuated that she would help him with the case in exchange for money. Thompson cross-examined Love regarding her inconsistent statements to police officers regarding another incident of Thompson\u2019s alleged abuse. The District Court excluded only a small portion of an otherwise considerable amount of damaging evidence regarding Love\u2019s credibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-7\">\u00b619  Moreover, Love\u2019s testimony alone did not provide the only evidence of the alleged assault. Police officers photographed Love\u2019s face on the morning after the alleged assault. The photographs documented bruising and other injuries suffered by Love. These photographs and the testimony of the investigating officers provided substantial evidence of Thompson\u2019s assault of Love. <em>Maier, </em>\u00b6 56. The court did not abuse its discretion in excluding Love\u2019s 10-year-old forgery charge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>based on the remoteness in time of the forgery charge, not a conviction, and the substantial evidence in the record to support the assault against Love.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-4\">\u00b620 <em>Whether the District Court imposed a legal sentence when it sentenced Thompson to a five-year commitment to the DOC.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b290-5\">\u00b621 Thompson contends that the court operated under a mistake of law when it imposed the five-year DOC commitment. Thompson cites this Court\u2019s analysis of the PFO statutes in <em>State v. Brendal, </em>2009 MT 236, 351 Mont. 395, 213 P.3d 448. The Court in <em>Brendal </em>determined that district courts must consider statutory alternatives to the PFO statutes when justified. The district court in <em>Brendal </em>clearly felt constrained by the PFO statutes. <em>Brendal, </em>\u00b6 7. Brendal failed to argue, however, that the PFO exception codified in \u00a7 46-18-222, MCA, applied.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-6\">\u00b622 Section 46-18-502(1), MCA, with few exceptions, requires a court to impose a five-year minimum sentence at the Montana State Prison for a PFO. Section 46-18-502(3), MCA, requires, with limited exceptions, that the first five years of a PFO sentence \u201cmay not be deferred or suspended.\u201d Section 46-18-222, MCA, sets forth the circumstances under which a court may forego these restrictions. In particular, Thompson argues that the District Court misinterpreted \u00a7 46-18-222(5), MCA. Subsection (5) allows a court to forego the restrictions when the offender inflicted \u201cno serious bodily injury\u201d upon the victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-7\">\u00b623 Thompson alleges that the State failed to present evidence that Love suffered \u201cserious bodily injury\u201d as defined in \u00a7 45-2-101(66), MCA. Thompson contends, as a result, that the statutory exception to a PFO sentence contained in \u00a7 46-18-222(5), MCA, should apply. We need not determine definitely whether the State presented evidence that Love suffered \u201cserious bodily injury\u201d in light of the fact that the court exercised its discretion under \u00a7 46-18-222(5), MCA, to depart from the mandatory PFO minimum sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-8\">\u00b624 The court committed Thompson to the DOC rather than sentencing him to five years \u201cin the state prison\u201d generally required for a PFO by \u00a7 46-18-502(1), MCA. The court followed the statutory exception authorized by \u00a7 46-18-222, MCA. The court explained to Thompson, however, that his \u201ccriminal history suggests risk to the community\u2019 and \u201csuggests risk to significant others that [Thompson] might become involved with.\u201d The court balanced protection to the community and a chance at rehabilitation for Thompson. The court also acknowledged Thompson\u2019s designation as a PFO.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>\u00b625  The District Court lawfully based its sentence upon Thompson\u2019s likelihood of reoffending and the court\u2019s desire to rehabilitate him. The court departed from the PFO statute by committing Thompson to the DOC. The District Court \u201ccorrectly applied the applicable statutes\u201d in Thompson\u2019s sentencing. <em>State v. Shults, </em>2006 MT 100, \u00b6 34, 332 Mont. 130, 136 P.3d 507.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-4\">\u00b626 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b291-5\">JUSTICES BAKER, NELSON, COTTER and RICE concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
