(Grant Creek) and Kenneth R. Knie (Knie) (collectively \u201cAppellants\u201d) appeal from the order of the Fourth Judicial District Court, Missoula County, that granted Missoula County\u2019s third motion for summary judgment. Missoula County, Missoula County Commissioners, J. Fern Hart and Michael Kennedy (collectively \u201cCounty\u201d) cross-appeal the District Court\u2019s denial of their second motion for summary judgment. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-5\">\u00b62 We review the following issues on appeal and cross-appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b71-6\">\u00b63 <em>1. Whether the District Court properly denied County\u2019s second motion for summary judgment.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b71-7\">\u00b64 <em>2. Whether the District Court properly granted County\u2019s third motion for summary judgment.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b71-8\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b71-9\">\u00b65 County adopted a Planned Unit Development (PUD) for the Grant Creek Area, known as Grantland, on October 17, 1979. Grantland consists of 3,600 acres formerly owned by the family of Jeanette Rankin. Knie owned a 160-acre parcel within this 3,600 acre area (Knie 160). Knie filed a certificate of survey in early 1987 that attempted to divide his 160 acres into 20-acre parcels.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-10\">\u00b66 County amended the PUD on March 25, 1987. County confirmed through a letter to Knie on April 1,1987, that the PUD applied to Knie 160. The letter stated that Knie had to meet several conditions within one year in order to proceed with his development. Knie failed to meet any of those conditions.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-11\">\u00b67 Missoula County Zoning Resolution (Resolution), Section 5.02, provides that a developer must submit a subdivision application within one year of the enactment of a PUD. If the developer fails to comply with the Resolution, the zoning in the area \u201cshall revert to the original zoning classification(s).\u201d Knie never submitted a subdivision request. County, accordingly, notified the Office of Community Development in 1991 that \u201cconditions for approval of the Grantland PUD have not been met,\u201d and that the PUD zone had reverted to its original zoning classification.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-12\">\u00b68 Appellants filed a complaint in district court in 1998. County filed a motion for summary judgment in 1998. The parties resolved all claims on November 10, 1999, \u201cknown or unknown at the time of this agreement.\u201d The agreement exempted from the settlement \u201ca claim that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>Knie Group may wish to assert in a separate proceeding regarding the issue of whether the County of Missoula properly terminated the Grantland [PUD], which said issue has not been part of this lawsuit.\u201d \u00b69 Appellants filed an amended complaint on January 10, 2005, to add PUD issues \u201cas to the portion of the Gleneagle subdivision which was not platted as of September 12,1991,\u201d and as stated in their motion and brief for reinstatement of PUD. The court provided that the amended complaint would not relate back to the time of filing the original complaint. The parties reserved the right to raise statute of limitation defenses. Appellants filed an amended complaint on February 8,2007, in which they alleged that County had failed to follow zoning obligations. Knie requested that the court reinstate the PUD zoning on his 160-acre parcel.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-4\">\u00b610 County filed a second motion for summary judgment pursuant to its argument that Appellants\u2019 amended complaint constituted a new cause of action. The court denied the second motion for summary judgment. The court\u2019s January 10, 2005, order allowed amendment as to \u201cPUD issues as to that portion of the Gleneagle subdivision which was not platted as of September 12, 1991.\u201d The court determined that Appellants\u2019 new claims comported with the 2005 order.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-5\">\u00b611 County filed a third motion for summaryjudgment on February 11, 2009. County argued that each of Appellants\u2019 claims failed as a matter of law due to the fact that Appellants had not satisfied the requirements of the Resolution. The District Court issued an opinion and order granting County\u2019s third motion for summary judgment on June 19, 2009. The court found that Appellants had failed to file any subdivision application within one year of the approval of the PUD. The court determined that the PUD zoning automatically had reverted to previous zoning designations due to Appellants\u2019 \u201cfailure to satisfy the requirements of the Missoula County Zoning Resolution, Section 5.02.\u201d The court further determined that the applicable statute of limitations barred Appellants\u2019 claim that Section 5.02 violated Montana notice laws. Section 76-2-202(l)(b), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-6\">\u00b612 Appellants filed a motion to alter or amend the judgment on July 9, 2009. The court denied Appellants\u2019 motion on September 8, 2009. Appellants timely appealed. County filed notice of cross-appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-7\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b72-8\">\u00b613 We review de novo a court\u2019s grant or denial of a summary judgment motion. <em>H&amp;H Dev., LLC v. Ramlow, </em>2012 MT 51, \u00b6 13, 364 Mont. 283, 272 P.3d 657. Summary judgment is proper \u201cwhen no genuine issue of material fact exists and the moving party is entitled to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>judgment as a matter of law.\u201d <em>H&amp;H, </em>\u00b6 13. We review for correctness a court\u2019s application of statute of limitations. <em>Johnson v. </em>Dist. <em>VII, Human Res. Dev. Council, </em>2009 MT 86, \u00b6 18, 349 Mont. 529, 204 P.3d 714.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-3\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b73-4\">\u00b614 <em>Whether the District Court denied properly County\u2019s second motion for summary judgment.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b73-5\">\u00b615 County argues that Appellants failed to raise allegations regarding zoning in their original 1998 complaint. County contends that the District Court had not allowed the complaint to be amended to include the Knie 160. County argues that, as a result, Appellants\u2019 decision to include the Knie 160 in its 2005 amended complaint constitutes a new cause of action. County further argues that various statutes of limitations bar Appellants\u2019 claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-6\">\u00b616 Section 76-2-227(1), MCA, provides that a petition of illegality of a zoning decision \u201cshall be presented to the court within 30 days after the filing of the decision in the office of the board.\u201d Similarly, \u00a7 76-2-202(l)(b), MCA, provides that an action challenging the creation of a zoning district must begin within six months of the board of county commissioners\u2019 order creating the district. County contends that the zoning classification action challenged by Appellants took place in 1991. This action came more than six years before Appellants filed their original complaint in 1998. The zoning classification took place more than 15 years before Appellants filed the amended complaint in 2006. \u00b617 The District Court\u2019s order on January 10, 2005, allowed amendment as to \u201cPUD issues as to that portion of the Gleneagle subdivision which was not platted as of September 12, 1991.\u201d County\u2019s second motion for summary judgment did not address the question as to whether Appellants\u2019 cause of action related back to the original filing date. County\u2019s second motion for summary judgment similarly failed to address the disputed issues regarding whether County followed proper zoning amendment guidelines.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-7\">\u00b618  The District Court properly denied County\u2019s second motion for summary judgment due to County\u2019s failure to address the newly raised cause of action relating back to the original filing date and proper zoning amendment guidelines. The court determined that the evidence presented by both parties raised material disputed issues regarding whether County had followed correct procedures and whether Appellants had knowledge that the PUD designation had lapsed. The District Court could not resolve the statute of limitations claims until <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>it had resolved those material disputed issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-4\">\u00b619 <em>Whether the District Court properly granted County\u2019s third motion for summary judgment.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b74-5\">\u00b620 Both parties do not dispute two key facts. Both parties agree that the applicable zoning regulations required the submission of a subdivision application within one year of the passage of the PUD. Resolution, Section 5.02(B)(2), contains relevant provisions related to the \u201cfinal procedure\u201d for establishment of a PUD. If a subdivision application is not submitted within one year of the PUD\u2019s approval, the zoning \u201cshall revert\u201d to the original classifications. Both parties agree that Knie failed to submit a subdivision application.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-6\">\u00b621 The court applied the plain language of this Resolution to the undisputed fact that Appellants never submitted a subdivision application. The court determined that this failure caused the PUD zoning to lapse and to revert to prior zoning designations. We agree. Appellants never submitted a subdivision application for the property at issue. Appellants failed to satisfy the requirements of the Resolution, Section 5.02.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-7\">\u00b622 Appellants contend that the 1979 version of the PUD constituted the \u201cprior zoning\u201d to which Knie 160 reverted. The 1979 PUD had expired, however, due to Knie\u2019s failure to submit a subdivision application within one year after the implementation of the PUD. Knie did not file a subdivision application within one year of the 1979 PUD. The zoning designation reverted at that time to the pre-PUD classification.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-8\">\u00b623 The 1987 amended PUD likewise expired when Knie did not submit a subdivision application within one year. Knie never filed a subdivision application. Thus, the prior zoning mandated by the zoning resolution amounted to the pre-PUD zoning, rather than to the 1979 version of the PUD.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-9\">\u00b624 Appellants further argue that the Resolution violates notice and public participation law. Section 76-2-205, MCA. Section 76-2-202(l)(b), MCA, provides, however, that a plaintiff must commence an action to challenge the creation of a zoning district within six months after the date of the order by the board of county commissioners. The zoning classification occurred in 1991. Appellants did not file their complaint, in which they first raised a challenge to County\u2019s action, until six years later.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-10\">\u00b625 Appellants additionally contend that no statute of limitations applies to bar their claims against County. Appellants assert that County failed to follow correct procedures in its decision to terminate the PUD, and, thus took no legitimate action that would have triggered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>the running of the statute of limitations. A statute of limitations applies, however, to alleged zoning decision errors. <em>Russell v. Flathead Co., </em>2003 MT 8, \u00b6 21, 314 Mont. 26, 67 P.3d 182.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-3\">\u00b626 Appellants argue that County improperly terminated the PUD in its 1991 letter to the Office of Community Development. The Resolution, Section 5.02(B)(2), contains language regarding the automatic reversion of property if the property owner fails to submit a subdivision application. This automatic reversion of the property, rather than the letter from County, constituted the appropriate triggering date for the six-month statute of limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-4\">\u00b627 Appellants argue in the alternative that the eight-year statute of limitations for contracts applies. Section 27-2-202, MCA. Appellants\u2019 contract claim arises from County\u2019s use of the parties\u2019 1999 agreement to demonstrate that the amended complaint did not relate back to the original claim. Appellants\u2019 argument fails, however, due to the fact that \u00a7 27-2-202(1), MCA, applies solely to claims based upon the enforcement of a contract. <em>Tin Cup Co. Water v. Garden City Plumbing &amp; Heating, Inc., </em>2008 MT 434, \u00b6 26, 347 Mont. 468, 200 P.3d 60. Appellants did not assert a contract claim in their complaint or amended complaints.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-5\">\u00b628 Appellants raise three additional claims on appeal. Appellants compare the Knie 160 to other portions of the original Grantland PUD that have not been subject to a development plan. Appellants argue that the District Court misunderstood to which properties County referred in its communication related to reversion to the previous zoning designation. Appellants base this claim on documents that County claims it provided in original discovery that Appellants failed to argue or brief in the District Court. Appellants next contend that County could not require the filing of a subdivision application for the Knie 160, as \u00a7 76-3-103(15), MCA (1987), provided that a subdivision could only apply to plots less than 20 acres in size. Appellants lastly claim that Knie met the conditions of PUD approval through his certificate of survey filed in 1987. Appellants failed to raise these arguments in District Court until after the court had issued its order on summary judgment. Appellants cannot raise them on appeal when they failed to provide the District Court with the chance to review them on a timely basis. <em>State v. Montgomery, </em>2010 MT 193, \u00b6 11, 357 Mont. 348, 239 P.3d 929.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-6\">\u00b629 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b75-7\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES NELSON, BAKER and RICE concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
