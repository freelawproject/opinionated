We affirm in part, reverse in part, and remand for further proceedings. We address the following issue:</p>\n<p id=\"b540-4\">\u00b62 <em>Did the District Court err by dismissing the complaint for failing to state a claim upon which relief could be granted ?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b540-5\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b540-6\">\u00b63 Martin filed a complaint and demand for jury trial against Artises in August 2010. These facts are taken from the complaint. Martin resides in the South Hills subdivision in Missoula. Artises\u2019 property lies immediately below and abuts Martin\u2019s property, and a boundary fence separates the properties. The complaint states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b540-7\">On [Artises\u2019] property is situated a tree, which has grown over the last several years so that it blocks a substantial portion of [Martin\u2019s] view of the city, valley and mountains. Last [Independence [D]ay, for example, [Martin] and his guest could see virtually none of the South Gate Mall fireworks display solely because of this tree blocking the view[.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b540-8\">\u00b64 Martin alleged that the tree\u2019s obstruction of his views was offensive to his senses, was an infringement upon the free use of his property, interfered with his comfortable enjoyment of his property, and diminished the aesthetic and monetary value of his property. He asserted that the tree was, and that Artises intended it to be, a nuisance.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-9\">\u00b65 Martin also alleged that \u201c[r]oots from the tree are encroaching onto [Martin\u2019s] property and are starting to buckle the boundary fence\u201d and that \u201cthe tree itself encroaches onto [Martin\u2019s] property over the common boundary fence.\u201d Martin asserted that the tree\u2019s encroachment upon his property constituted trespass. Acknowledging that Artises had \u201crecently cut a few branches from the tree\u201d after he contacted them, Martin nonetheless asserted that Artises \u201cknow their tree is growing over the fence onto [Martin\u2019s] property and is buckling his fence but refuse to do anything to stop it; that such trespass is continuing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b540-10\">\u00b66 Finally, alleging that Artises had notice and knowledge of the alleged facts, Martin asserted that Artises are guilty of actual malice and that he is entitled to an award of punitive damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-11\">\u00b67 Artises filed a motion to dismiss the complaint, arguing that Martin had failed to state a claim upon which relief can be granted because a naturally growing tree is not a nuisance or trespass as a matter of law. The District Court granted the motion and dismissed the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>complaint. Martin appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-4\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b541-5\">\u00b68 We review de novo a district court\u2019s decision on a motion to dismiss. <em>Rooney v. City of Cut Bank, </em>2012 MT 149, \u00b6 13, 365 Mont. 375, 286 P.3d 241 (citation omitted). We \u201cconstrue the complaint in a light most favorable to the plaintiff, deeming all factual allegations to be <em>true.'\u201d Fellows v. Office of Water Comm\u2019r, </em>2012 MT 169, \u00b6 11, 365 Mont. 540, 258 P.3d 448. \u201cThis Court will affirm the dismissal only if it finds that the plaintiff is not entitled to relief under any set of facts that could be proven in support of the claims.\u201d <em>Fellows, </em>\u00b6 11 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b541-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b541-7\">\u00b69 <em>Did the District Court err by dismissing the complaint for failing to state a claim upon which relief could be granted ?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b541-8\">\u00b610 <em>A. Nuisance claim for obstruction of view by a naturally growing tree.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b541-9\">\u00b611 The statutory definition of nuisance provides that \u201c[ajnything which is injurious to health, indecent or offensive to the senses, or an obstruction to the free use of property, so as to interfere with the comfortable enjoyment of life or property ... is a nuisance.\u201d Section 27-30-101(1), MCA (2009). Noting the absence of express authority creating a right in a landowner to an unobstructed view, and citing to California cases holding that the law is reluctant to imply such a right, the District Court concluded that Martin had no legally enforceable right to demand that Artises reduce the size of their tree, and dismissed his nuisance claim. Martin argues for a contrary conclusion, citing the definition of nuisance within \u00a7 27-30-101(1), MCA, and our decision in <em>Tarlton v. Kaufman, </em>2008 MT 462, 348 Mont. 178, 199 P.3d 263.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-10\">\u00b612 In <em>Tarlton, </em>a dispute between Tarltons and Kaufmans, adjoining landowners, led Kaufmans to construct a chain link fence that \u201cstood approximately 20 feet above a newly constructed 6-foot high berm, measured 270 feet in length, and was covered in two layers of dark material.\u201d <em>Tarlton, </em>\u00b6 9. Tarlton brought a nuisance claim, alleging \u201cthe fence destroyed the aesthetic value of their property, that it reduced the value of their property, that it destroyed their view, and that it was an eyesore.\u201d <em>Tarlton, </em>\u00b6 10. In addition to instructing the jury that Tarltons had to prove that the Kaufmans, by building the fence, created a condition that was either injurious to health, indecent or offensive to the senses, or an obstruction to the free use of property, which caused an unreasonable interference with Tarlton\u2019s enjoyment of their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>property, the trial court further instructed the jury that \u201c[generally, a structure or condition cannot constitute a nuisance merely because it is unsightly or because it obstructs a party\u2019s view.\u201d <em>Tarlton, </em>\u00b6 15. The jury found that Kaufman\u2019s fence was not a nuisance. <em>Tarlton, </em>\u00b6 16. We reversed, concluding that the additional jury instruction to the effect that, \u201c[generally, a structure or condition cannot constitute a nuisance merely because it is considered unsightly or obstructs a party\u2019s view,\u201d improperly limited the statutory definition of nuisance and was misleading and confusing to the jury. <em>Tarlton, </em>\u00b6 43.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-4\">\u00b613 In deciding <em>Tarlton, </em>we rejected Kaufman\u2019s invitation to apply the holdings of the courts of California, the source of Montana\u2019s statute, even though we had previously looked to California for guidance in interpreting the statute, <em>see Barnes v. City of Thompson Falls, </em>1999 MT 77, \u00b6 19, 294 Mont. 76, 979 P.2d 1275, reasoning that \u201cthis discussion does not require an investigation of California nuisance law since our analysis considers only the question of whether the District Court fully and fairly instructed the jury on Montana\u2019s nuisance law.\u201d <em>Tarlton, </em>\u00b6 27. California courts have held that, \u201c[a]s a general rule, a landowner has no natural right to air, light or an unobstructed view and the law is reluctant to imply such a right.\u201d <em>Pacifica Homeowners\u2019Ass\u2019n v. Wesley Palms Ret. Community, </em>178 Cal. App. 3d 1147, 1152, 224 Cal. Rptr. 380, 382 (1986) (citing <em>Venuto v. Owens-Corning Fiberglas Corp., </em>22 Cal. App. 3d 116, 127, 99 Cal. Rptr. 350, 357 (1971)). Kaufman had also offered earlier Montana cases rejecting nuisance claims under the statute, but we factually distinguished those cases, explaining that they did not \u201caddress the question of whether a fence\u2019s (or similar structure\u2019s) unsightliness or view obstruction could or could not be factors of a nuisance claim in Montana.\u201d <em>Tarlton, </em>\u00b6 25.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-5\">\u00b614 Tarlton\u2019s analysis, in which we distinguished earlier Montana and California nuisance holdings, demonstrates that, while it is possible under \u00a7 27-30-101(1), MCA, for \u201canything\u201d to constitute a nuisance, a nuisance claim must nonetheless plead a factual foundation that satisfies governing legal standards. \u201cA nuisance action may be based upon conduct of a defendant that is either intentional, negligent, reckless, or ultrahazardous.\u201d <em>Barnes, </em>\u00b6 16. We have explained that a nuisance may either be a nuisance <em>per se </em>or a nuisance <em>per accidens. Barnes, </em>\u00b6 17. A nuisance <em>per se </em>or at law is \u201can inherently injurious act, occupation, or structure that is a nuisance at all times and under any circumstances, without regard to location or surroundings.\u201d <em>Barnes, </em>\u00b6 17. A nuisance <em>per accidens </em>or in fact \u201cis one which becomes a nuisance by virtue of circumstances and surroundings.\u201d <em>Barnes, </em>\u00b6 17. Likewise, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>a nuisance may also be classified as either absolute or qualified. <em>Barnes, </em>\u00b6 18. An absolute nuisance is \u201ca nuisance, the substance ... of which is not negligence, which obviously exposes another to probable injury.\u201d <em>Barnes, </em>\u00b6 18 (internal quotations omitted). A qualified nuisance is a \u201cnuisance dependent on negligence that consists of anything lawfully but so negligently or carelessly done or permitted as to create a potential and unreasonable risk of harm, which, in due course, results in injury to another.\u201d <em>Barnes, </em>\u00b6 18 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b543-4\">\u00b615 Although we concluded that the jury instruction in <em>Tarlton </em>improperly limited \u00a7 27-30-101, MCA, that case involved a 270-foot by 20-foot man-made chain link fence covered in dark material and placed on a newly constructed 6-foot high berm adjacent to the neighboring property. <em>Tarlton, </em>\u00b6 9. We did not hold in <em>Tarlton </em>that a nuisance claim would lie for any obstruction of view whatsoever. Here, the complaint alleges that a tree, in the course of its natural growth, has risen tall enough to obstruct Martin\u2019s view. Although Martin\u2019s complaint broadly claims that Artises\u2019 tree has reduced the aesthetic and monetary value of his property, interfered with the comfortable enjoyment of his property, and offended his senses, the entire factual basis of the claim is that a tree has obstructed his view because of natural growth.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-5\">\u00b616  There is extensive jurisprudence in other jurisdictions and commentary on the issue of whether trees and vegetation may constitute a nuisance, and various rules have been adopted to define the conditions for which a claim may be made. <em>See, i.e., </em>F.S. Tinio, <em>Rights and Liabilities of Adjoining Landowners as to Trees, Shrubbery, or Similar Plants Growing on Boundary Line, </em>26 A.L.R.3d 1372 (1969); <em>Restatement (Second) of Torts </em>\u00a7 840 (1979); <em>Ken Cowden Chevrolet, Inc. v. Corts, </em>316 N.W.2d 259 (Mich. Ct. App. 1982); <em>Fancher v. Fagella, </em>650 S.E.2d 519 (Va. 2007); <em>Whitesell v. Houlton, </em>632 P.2d 1077 (Haw. Ct. App. 1981); <em>Lane v. W.J. Curry &amp; Sons, </em>92 S.W.3d 355 (Tenn. 2002). We decline to address or adopt any specific rules in this present case because we conclude that the nuisance claim plead in Martin\u2019s complaint does not satisfy the standards governing nuisance under current Montana law. The assertion that Artises\u2019 naturally growing tree has obstructed Martin\u2019s view does not constitute, as a matter of law, \u201cconduct of a defendant that is either intentional, negligent, reckless, or ultrahazardous,\u201d \u201can inherently injurious act,\u201d or a condition which \u201cobviously exposes another to probable injury.\u201d <em>Barnes, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 16-18. We thus conclude that the District Court properly granted the Artises\u2019 motion to dismiss Martin\u2019s nuisance claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-6\">\u00b617 <em>B. Trespass claim for encroaching tree trunk and roots.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b544-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>\u00b618 \u201cThe entry of another person or thing obstructs a property owner\u2019s exclusive possession. A party need not establish actual harm or damages in a traditional trespass action.\u201d <em>Tally Bissell Neighbors, Inc. v. Eyrie Shotgun Ranch, LLC, </em>2010 MT 63, \u00b6 38, 355 Mont. 387, 228 P.3d 1134. \u201cOne is subject to liability to another for trespass, irrespective of whether he thereby causes harm to any legally protected interest of the other, if he intentionally (a) enters land in possession of the other, or causes a thing or third person to do so, or (b) remains on the land, or (c) fails to remove from the land a thing which he is under a duty to remove.\u201d <em>Branstetter v. Beaumont Supper Club, </em>224 Mont. 20, 24, 727 P.2d 933, 935 (1986) (quoting <em>Restatement (Second) of Torts </em>\u00a7 158 (1965)). The \u201cintent\u201d element of trespass is fulfilled when \u201cthe actor desires to cause consequences [sic] of his act, or that he believes that the consequences are substantially certain to result from it.\u201d <em>Branstetter, </em>224 Mont. at 24, 727 P.2d at 935 (quoting <em>Restatement (Second) of Torts </em>\u00a7 8A (1965)).</p>\n<p id=\"b544-4\">\u00b619 Martin\u2019s complaint alleges a trespass because the Artises\u2019 tree extends over the shared fence and the roots grow onto his property. The complaint further states that \u201cnearly 40% of the tree itself encroaches onto [Martin\u2019s] property over the common boundary fence\u201d and that \u201cHoots from the tree are encroaching onto [Martin\u2019s] property and are starting to buckle the boundary fence.\u201d Regarding intent, the complaint alleges that \u201c[Artises] know their tree is growing over the fence onto the property and is buckling his fence but refuse to do anything to stop it,\u201d that Artises\u2019 \u201cconduct is motivated by malice and/or willful, wanton and reckless disregard for [Martin\u2019s] rights,\u201d and that Artises are guilty of actual malice \u201cbecause they had notice and knowledge of\u2019 the alleged facts. Although Artises argue that the complaint fails to plead an intention to trespass by way of their tree, we conclude that, for purposes of a M. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss, intent was adequately pled.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-5\">\u00b620  The complaint alleges that the roots of Artises\u2019 tree have entered, remained on, and damaged Martin\u2019s property. Because the complaint adequately states a legal claim for trespass under Montana law, we reverse the order dismissing Martin\u2019s trespass claim, and remand to the District Court for further proceedings on that claim. \u00b621 Affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<judges id=\"b544-6\">JUSTICES COTTER, WHEAT, BAKER and MORRIS concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
