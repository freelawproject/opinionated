Appellants Pete and Elva Horn (Horn) appeal the Twentieth Judicial District Court\u2019s order denying their motion for a new trial. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-14\">\u00b62 We restate the issues as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b518-15\">\u00b63 1. <em>Is Horn entitled to a new trial because Bull River\u2019s reliance on the settled-party defense authorized by \u00a7 27-1-703, MCA, violated his due process rights?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b518-17\">\u00b64 2. <em>Did the District Court abuse its discretion when it allowed Bull River to question Pete Horn about his unrelated insurance claims?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b518-18\">\u00b65 3. <em>Did the District Court abuse its discretion when it denied Horn\u2019s motion for a new trial based on Bull River\u2019s insurance-related arguments?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b519-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>\u00b66 4. <em>Is Horn entitled to a new trial on the ground of juror misconduct?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b519-3\">PROCEDURAL AND FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b519-4\">\u00b67 Pete Horn filed suit against Bull River and other fictitious defendants on January 6, 2010. Horn alleged that he purchased forty-two gallons of water-contaminated diesel fuel at the Bull River store in Noxon, Montana in late February and early March of 2008. Horn allegedly transported that fuel in five-and-six gallon jugs to his work site in Grand Coulee, Washington, where he used heavy machinery to engage in landscaping work on land owned by his son, Jason Horn. In mid-March 2008, Pete Horn used the diesel fuel from those jugs to fill the fuel tanks of two heavy machines that he owned-a Case W-ll Articulated Wheel Loader (Case) and a Kobelco Sk045 Mini-Excavator (Kobelco). The engines in those machines began to run poorly shortly thereafter.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-5\">\u00b68 Pete Horn and his mechanic, Jerry Amoruso, determined the engine problems were caused by water-contaminated diesel fuel and Horn called Bull River to complain. A Bull River employee informed Horn that the gas station had received multiple complaints regarding recently-sold diesel fuel and invited Horn to call Bull River\u2019s owners, Robert and Carol Page. Horn called Carol Page, who told Horn to contact Bull River\u2019s insurance company, Farmers Insurance Exchange (Farmers).</p>\n<p id=\"b519-6\">\u00b69 Upon learning from other customers that there was a problem with its diesel fuel, Bull River immediately shut down the diesel fuel pumps and called its diesel fuel supplier, Moore Oil Co., Inc. (Moore Oil), to report the problem. Bull River and Moore Oil each tested Bull River\u2019s diesel tank for the presence of water, and each found a small amount of water at the bottom of the tank. Bull River claimed the water was a normal result of condensation and was pooled beneath the pump intake. Moore Oil nonetheless pumped the water out of the tank and replaced the diesel fuel.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-7\">\u00b610 Horn formally reported a claim to Farmers for damages to both his Case and Kobelco machines on April 15, 2008. Ruth Mikulic, an insurance adjuster who worked for Farmers, handled Horn\u2019s claim. Mikulic was responsible for resolving eleven other claims against Bull River, all of which involved allegations that diesel fuel purchased at the gas station in late February or early March damaged the engines of various vehicles and pieces of machinery. All eleven of those other claims settled without problem after those claimants submitted documents to Farmers evidencing their repair costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>\u00b611 Farmers ultimately tendered to Horn $16,042, but was unable to resolve Horn\u2019s remaining claims for damage to his machinery. Horn filed suit against Bull River on January 6, 2010, claiming loss of use damages for both machines during a 1,320-day period that began on March 10, 2008, and ended on the final day of the trial. The parties stipulated that a reasonable rental rate for machines similar to Horn\u2019s was $400 per day for each machine. In total, Horn sought damages from Bull River in excess of one million dollars. Horn argued that Farmers, as the agent of Bull River, inadequately investigated the damage to his equipment and delayed payment of his claim. Since he did not have the resources to pay for the equipment repairs himself, Horn claimed he was unable to get back to work without Farmers\u2019 payment of the costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-4\">\u00b6 12 Bull River claimed that Horn could not trace water contamination to fuel obtained from its store and that if he did purchase contaminated fuel there, his injuries, if any, were caused by others, including Horn\u2019s mechanic and Horn himself for running the damaged engines until they burned up. Bull River also argued to the jury that Horn had failed to prove any negligence by Bull River or the Pages. \u00b613 At the conclusion of trial, ten jurors agreed that Bull River was not negligent and the jury returned a defense verdict. Horn filed a motion for a new trial on November 21,2011, which the District Court denied on December 14, 2011. Horn appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-5\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b520-6\">\u00b614 \u201cOur standard of review of a district court\u2019s denial of a motion for a new trial depends on the basis of the motion.\u201d <em>Stebner v. Associated Materials, Inc., </em>2010 MT 138, \u00b6 11, 356 Mont. 520, 234 P.3d 94. As such, the standards of review are discussed below as applicable to the issues raised. Our review of constitutional questions is plenary. <em>City of Billings v. Albert, </em>2009 MT 63, \u00b6 11, 349 Mont. 400, 203 P.3d 828.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b520-8\">\u00b615 1. <em>Is Horn entitled to a new trial because Bull River\u2019s reliance on the settled-party defense authorized by \u00a7 27-1-703, MCA, violated his due process rights?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b520-9\">\u00b616 Although Horn\u2019s original complaint named only Bull River and fictitious parties as defendants, Horn later amended the complaint to include Moore Oil and Richard Watts Jr. Trucking, Inc. (Watts Trucking), which had delivered the fuel to Bull River. Horn later settled his claims against Moore Oil and Watts Trucking and those claims were dismissed with prejudice on June 7, 2011.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>\u00b617 After learning that Horn had settled his claims against Moore Oil and Watts Trucking, Bull River sought leave to amend its answer to plead a settled-party defense under \u00a7 27-1-703, MCA (2007). That statute provides that in a negligence action, <em>\u201ca </em>defendant may assert as a defense that the damages of the claimant were caused in full or in part by a person with whom the claimant has settled or who the claimant has released from liability.\u201d Section 27-1-703(6)(a), MCA (2007). If the defendant asserts a settled-party defense, \u201cthe trier of fact shall consider the negligence of persons released from liability by the claimant or with whom the claimant has settled.\u201d Section 27-1-703(6)(b), MCA (2007). The settled party then has the \u201copportunity to intervene in the action to defend against claims affirmatively asserted, including the opportunity to be represented by an attorney, present a defense, participate in discovery, cross-examine witnesses, and appear as a witness of either party ...\u201d Section 27-l-703(6)(f)(ii), MCA (2007). \u00b618 Prior to the statute\u2019s amendment in 1997, we held that \u00a7 21-1-703, MCA (1995), violated the substantive due process rights of plaintiffs and unnamed parties because the statute allowed apportionment of liability \u201cto parties who are not named in the lawsuit and <em>who do not have an opportunity to appear and defend themselves ...\u201d Plumb v. Fourth Jud. Dist. Ct., </em>279 Mont. 363, 379, 927 P.2d 1011, 1021 (1996) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b521-3\">\u00b619 Before the District Court, Horn filed a motion in limine to preclude Bull River from raising a settled-party defense at trial. He argued that \u00a7 27-1-703, MCA (2007), was unconstitutional on the same grounds that this Court invalidated earlier provisions of the statute in <em>Plumb. </em>The District Court denied Horn\u2019s motion because it determined that \u201cBull River ha[d] complied with the statutory requirements\u201d for a settled-party defense under the new law by amending its answer to plead a non-party defense against settled and released entities Moore Oil and Watts Trucking. The third-party complaint against Jerry Amoruso also was settled prior to trial, but Amoruso appeared and defended the claim at trial, as authorized by \u00a7 27-l-703(6)(f)(ii), MCA. \u00b620 On the final day of trial and just prior to the parties\u2019 closing arguments, Horn\u2019s counsel joined with Amoruso\u2019s counsel in a M. R. Civ. P. 50 motion for judgment as a matter of law as to Moore Oil and Watts Trucking. Horn and Amoruso argued that Bull River had not produced any evidence demonstrating that either of the settled non-parties was negligent in handling the fuel delivered to Bull River. The District Court denied their motion and allowed the jury to weigh whatever evidence may have been presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-4\">\u00b621 The District Court then turned its attention to the special verdict <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>form. Counsel for Bull River stated that he had \u201cno problem with this verdict form.\u201d Horn\u2019s counsel, who had prepared the special verdict form, offered no additional comments or changes to the form. The special verdict form called upon the jury first to determine whether Bull River was negligent. If the jury answered \u201cyes\u201d to that question, the jury was to proceed to the remaining questions on the special verdict form, which in part asked the jury to determine whether either Moore Oil or Watts Trucking was negligent. If the jury answered \u201cno\u201d to the first question, the jury was instructed to sign and date the special verdict form and call the bailiff. Because the jury answered \u201cno\u201d to the question whether Bull River was negligent, it returned the special verdict form without considering the negligence of Moore Oil or Watts Trucking.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-4\">\u00b622 On appeal, Horn argues that \u00a7 27-1-703, MCA (2007), is unconstitutional as a violation of his right to due process of law. Bull River responds by contending that Horn lacks standing to challenge the constitutionality of the statute because Horn \u201cdid not sustain any loss associated with the settled-party defense.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b522-5\">\u00b623 The defect we have found in pre-1997 versions of \u00a7 27-1-703, MCA, primarily concerned the jury\u2019s apportionment of fault as between parties and nonparties to the litigation. Based on the likelihood that juries may assign a disproportionate share of liability to unrepresented parties, we held in <em>Cusenbary v. Mortensen </em>that \u201c[tjhere is no mechanism provided in \u00a7 27-1-703, MCA (1995), by which the negligence of nonparties, including third party defendants released from liability, can be fairly apportioned by a jury.\u201d 1999 MT 221, \u00b6 60, 296 Mont. 25, 987 P.2d 351.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-6\">\u00b624 Whether application in this case of \u00a7 27-1-703, MCA, constituted a similar denial of due process is not properly before us on this record and in light of the verdict actually rendered. Having found no negligence by Bull River, there was no fault to be apportioned. When the jury found that Bull River was not negligent, its task was finished as instructed by the special verdict form prepared and proposed- by Horn.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-7\">\u00b625 Although Horn argues that Bull River\u2019s introduction of the conduct of the settled parties allowed it to diminish its own responsibility without sufficient evidence that the settled parties had contributed to the injury, we fail to discern how the admission of this evidence materially affected Horn\u2019s substantial rights as required to prevail on a motion for a new trial. Section 25-11-102, MCA. The verdict form gives no indication whether the jury might have considered the settled parties to be negligent. Without a finding of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>negligence against Bull River, the jury was not asked to determine the negligence of the settled parties. It is impossible to know whether the jury would have found Moore Oil or Watts Trucking negligent, or whether it would have apportioned 100% of fault to those settling non-parties, had it found fault by anyone. \u201c[W]e certainly will not speculate\u201d when the verdict form does not explain the jury\u2019s thought processes. <em>Seltzer v. Morton, </em>2007 MT 62, \u00b6 97, 336 Mont. 225, 154 P.3d 561 <em>;Ammondson v. Northwestern Corp., </em>2009 MT 331, \u00b6 82, 353 Mont. 28, 220 P.3d 1. As noted, Horn\u2019s counsel prepared the special verdict form. It is well established that \u201cacquiescence in error takes away the right of objecting to it.\u201d <em>In re A.A., </em>2005 MT 119, \u00b6 26, 327 Mont. 127, 112 P.3d 993 (quoting \u00a7 1-3-207, MCA). We will not place the District Court in error \u201cfor an action to which the appealing party acquiesced or actively participated.\u201d <em>In re A.A., </em>\u00b6 26.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-3\">\u00b626  When presented with constitutional challenges, we have been guided by the principle that \u201c[a] court should not decide the constitutionality of a statute if the case can be decided without reaching the constitutional question.\u201d <em>Kulstad v. Maniaci, </em>2010 MT 248, \u00b6 49, 358 Mont. 230, 244 P.3d 722 <em>(citing Baxter v. State, </em>2009 MT 449, \u00b6 10, 354 Mont. 234, 224 P.3d 1211). We hold that, in light of the special verdict form and the jury\u2019s finding that the named party defendant was not negligent, Horn cannot demonstrate prejudice from Bull River\u2019s reliance on the settled-party defense authorized by \u00a7 27-1-703, MCA. As such, we need not address the constitutionality of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-4\">\u00b627 2. <em>Did the District Court abuse its discretion when it allowed Bull River to question Pete Horn about his unrelated insurance claims?</em></p>\n<p id=\"A0O\">\u00b628 During the fourth day of trial, Horn\u2019s counsel cross-examined Michael Rodrigue, an independent insurance adjuster for Farmers who assisted Ruth Mikulic with the claims against Bull River, regarding his testimony that Horn did not follow through with his responsibility to submit documentation supporting his claim:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-5\">Q. You knew the rules of the road when it came to handling insurance claims; correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-6\">A. Correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-7\">Q. Pete Horn had never received the same instructions as a claims adjustor as you; correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-8\">A. I don\u2019t know that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-9\">Q. Okay. Pete hadn\u2019t been to any sort of certification or training in handling insurance claims to the best of your knowledge.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-10\">A. I don\u2019t know that either.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-11\">Q. All right. So fair to say you didn\u2019t know what sort of experience <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>Pete had in terms of submitting claims to insurance companies. Fair?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-4\">A. Fair.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-5\">Q. Okay. And during the course of your involvement in this claim you were aware that Pete had likely never handled an insurance claim like this one; correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-6\">A. Correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-7\">Q. In fact, most people hadn\u2019t. Fair?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-8\">A. That\u2019s fair, yeah.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-9\">Q. Mr. Horn did not have experience in handling insurance claims like this one to the best of your knowledge; correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-10\">A. Correct.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b524-11\">\u00b629 Based on this line of questioning, Bull River\u2019s counsel requested a bench conference prior to his redirect examination. Counsel for Bull River informed the District Court outside the presence of the jury:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-12\">I instructed [Michael Rodrigue] to not say a word about those insurance claims even though he was directly asked that. So I would ask for leave of the Court to ask Mr. Rodrigue what he knows about the prior insurance claims that Mr. Horn has made.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AU4\">Horn\u2019s counsel responded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-13\">No. During his deposition I asked him the same questions and you heard his testimony. He denied any knowledge of Mr. Horn\u2019s insurance claims. I don\u2019t have any knowledge of Pete Horn\u2019s insurance claims. I don\u2019t know where we\u2019re going with this. So how am I to learn-</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b524-14\">The trial court asked counsel about the source of information regarding Horn\u2019s prior insurance claims. Bull River\u2019s counsel responded that he did not know because he had informed Rodrigue that a ruling in limine precluded any such testimony. The court then ruled:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-15\">Well, we\u2019re not going to be able to get it out of this witness. <em>If you\u2019re going to get it out of anybody you\u2019re going to have ask Mr. Horn </em>question [sic]. You can cross-examine him ... [to ask] if he has done this before, what his background is, that the Court finds that it would be proper that the plaintiff could address that issue. I don\u2019t find that that\u2019s appropriate for this witness [Rodrigue], especially given the fact that that was apparently unknown to both counsel before we walked through the door here.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b524-16\">(Emphasis added.) Horn\u2019s counsel responded to the court\u2019s decision by saying, \u201c[t]hank you, Your Honor.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b524-17\">\u00b630 Bull River recalled Pete Horn during its case-in-chief and proceeded to question him about a litany of insurance claims he had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>filed since 1997. Horn\u2019s counsel did not object.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-3\">\u00b631 Horn asserts that the District Court abused its discretion when it allowed Bull River to question him about these unrelated insurance claims without any showing that the claims were relevant to the issue before the jury. Horn contends that he properly objected to Bull River\u2019s line of questioning. In the alternative, Horn proposes that, even if he did not properly object, his earlier motion in limine to exclude \u201cany questions regarding or reference to Horn\u2019s past claims or litigation\u201d preserved his objection for appeal. Bull River responds that Horn opened the door and failed timely to object to questions regarding his past insurance claims. Bull River further reasons that Horn\u2019s motion in limine was not specific enough to preserve an objection because it did not mention insurance claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-4\">\u00b632 We review a district court\u2019s evidentiary rulings to determine not whether this Court would have made the same ruling, but whether the district court \u201c \u2018acted arbitrarily without conscientious judgment or exceeded the bounds of reason\u2019 and prejudiced a substantial right of the appellant.\u201d <em>Weber v. BNSF Ry. Co., </em>2011 MT 223, \u00b6 39, 362 Mont. 53, 261 P.3d 984 (quoting <em>Seltzer, \u00b6 </em>65).</p>\n<p id=\"b525-5\">\u00b633 The law is clear that a motion in limine <em>\u201cmay </em>relieve a party of the obligation to contemporaneously object at trial <em>provided] that the motion is specific and articulates the grounds for the objection.\u201d State v. Stock, </em>2011 MT 131, \u00b6 45, 361 Mont. 1, 256 P.3d 899 (quoting <em>State v. Ankeny, </em>2010 MT 224, \u00b6 39, 358 Mont. 32, 243 P.3d 391) (emphasis in original). Horn\u2019s unopposed motion requested that \u201cno evidence, testimony, or reference should be allowed regarding past claims or litigation involving plaintiffs.\u201d The record indicates that both Horn and Bull River understood that the motion in limine encompassed Horn\u2019s past insurance claims. Bull River\u2019s counsel told the District Court that he had specifically instructed Rodrigue \u201cto not say a word about those insurance claims\u201d because of the \u201cmotion in limine,\u201d but urged the court to allow the testimony because Horn\u2019s questioning had opened the door.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-6\">\u00b634  Assuming Horn\u2019s motion preserved the objection, we have held that a party who obtains an order in limine may waive his right to rely on that order by acquiescing at trial to the introduction of the evidence in question. <em>Ankeny, </em>\u00b6 48. When the District Court ruled that Rodrigue could not be questioned regarding Horn\u2019s prior insurance claims but Horn could be, Horn not only registered no objection, he thanked the court for its ruling. Horn\u2019s counsel made no objection when the questions later were put to Horn directly. We hold that, by affirmatively acquiescing to the District Court\u2019s ruling, Horn waived <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>his right to argue on appeal that his motion in limine prohibited the introduction of his past insurance claims. Horn is not entitled to a new trial on this ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-4\">\u00b635 3. <em>Did the District Court abuse its discretion when it denied Horn\u2019s motion for a new trial based on Bull River\u2019s insurance-related arguments?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b526-5\">\u00b636 Horn argues that, throughout the jury trial, Bull River \u201cattempted to confuse the lines between this case and an insurance bad faith case against Farmers Insurance\u201d in a way that was \u201cprejudicial to Mr. Horn.\u201d Although \u201c[ejvidence of a party\u2019s insured status is generally inadmissible in Montana,\u201d <em>Gurnsey v. Conklin, </em>230 Mont. 42, 48, 751 P.2d 151, 154 (1988), the parties agreed to allow such evidence in this case. Horn\u2019s theory of the case was that Bull River was responsible for the conduct of its agent, Farmers, in failing to resolve Horn\u2019s claim on \u201can admitted liability\u201d case.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-6\">\u00b637 Horn made it clear to Farmers at the outset of the claims process that he could not afford to repair his equipment until Farmers paid his claim. In the Final Pretrial Order, Horn\u2019s contentions of fact included the claim that \u201cFarmers\u2019 Insurance Exchange, on behalf of Bull River, has acted unreasonably in the handling of Horn\u2019s claim and has unreasonably denied the claim and delayed resolution of the claim.\u201d Horn\u2019s contentions also referenced his complaint against Farmers with the Montana Insurance Commissioner. He questioned Bull River\u2019s witnesses at trial about the Commissioner\u2019s actions in response to his complaint. Horn also called as a rebuttal witness Theresa Oakley, a compliance specialist with the Insurance Commissioner, who testified that Farmers\u2019 response to Horn\u2019s claim was \u201cbeyond unbelievable\u201d and that she would have been \u201cembarrassed\u201d to have been the adjuster who had handled his claim. Horn argued to the jury that because Farmers was \u201cBull River\u2019s agent for the purpose of handling claims against Bull River and conducting litigation on Bull River\u2019s behalf,\u201d Bull River ultimately was responsible for the loss of use damages caused by Farmers\u2019 dilatory handling of Horn\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-7\">\u00b638 Bull River responded to that argument at trial by arguing to the jury that F\u00e1rmers\u2019 actions in handling the claim did not prove that water contamination occurred due to Bull River\u2019s negligence. The only statement made by counsel for Bull River to which Horn specifically objected is the following from Bull River\u2019s opening statement:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b526-8\">As Mr. Duerk pointed at the beginning [sic], this is in essence a negligence case. As you hear the evidence, what we heard through this whole demonstration on the screen, folks, it wasn\u2019t a negligence case against Bull River Store. It was essentially an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>insurance bad faith case against Farmers Insurance. And Farmers Insurance is not a party. I know I keep saying that and you\u2019re going to hear a lot of that, but that\u2019s a fact. In fact, and this is something you should know, too, what he\u2019s talking about, all his complaints that he was throwing up there on the screen-</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AaT\">At that point, Horn\u2019s counsel interrupted and said: \u201cYour Honor, we are at a point where this is just argument. He\u2019s categorizing my case. That\u2019s not evidence.\u201d The District Court did not overrule the objection, but instructed counsel for Bull River to \u201ctry staying with an opening statement that goes to the facts you intend to show.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b527-3\">\u00b639 Counsel for Bull River told the jury in his opening statement that \u201cMr. Horn\u2019s beef is very clearly against the insurance company here. No dispute about that. And he\u2019s got the right to bring that in a subsequent case if he so chooses.\u201d Horn did not object to that statement by Bull River or otherwise interrupt that portion of opposing counsel\u2019s opening statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-4\">\u00b640 Horn argues on appeal that Bull River misled the jury \u201cin an attempt to make it believe that Mr. Horn could recover all of his claimed damages against Farmers Insurance.\u201d Horn asserts that \u201cBull River continued throughout trial to argue, in essence, that Mr. Horn should recover damages from Farmers\u2019 Insurance [sic].\u201d He fails, however, to point to any specific objections he made to statements that he now labels as prejudicial or misleading. Horn made no objections during Bull River\u2019s closing argument that the defendant had nothing to do with controlling Farmers\u2019 handling of Horn\u2019s claim and that \u201cFarmers Insurance is not a party to this case.\u201d Horn fails to demonstrate how the District Court abused its discretion in allowing such statements in the absence of any objections and in light of Horn\u2019s own contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-5\">\u00b641  Failure to make a timely objection \u201cconstitutes waiver of the right to claim error on appeal.\u201d <em>In re Bower, </em>2010 MT 19, \u00b6 20, 355 Mont. 108, 225 P.3d 784. In light of the trial record, we hold that the District Court did not abuse its discretion when it denied Horn\u2019s motion for a new trial based on Bull River\u2019s insurance-related arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-6\">\u00b642 4. <em>Is Horn entitled to a new trial on the ground of juror misconduct?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b527-7\">\u00b643 In support of his motion for a new trial, Horn submitted affidavits from two jurors-Eugene Ronning and Johnny Goodman-as support for his argument that \u201c[he] was prevented from a fair trial when Juror, Anna Wood brought external information into the jury room.\u201d Ronning and Goodman were the two jurors who disagreed with the jury\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>finding that Bull River was not negligent. According to Ronning, \u201cAnna Wood discussed her position as manager of a gas station in Thompson Falls\u201d during jury deliberations and \u201cdiscussed the precautions taken at her gas station which prevent water from getting into the diesel fuel.\u201d Goodman provided a similar statement and further said that Wood\u2019s statements \u201cwere made so that the jury would not find Bull River Country Store Properties negligent\u201d and were \u201ca major factor in the jury\u2019s determination ....\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b528-4\">\u00b644 Horn contends that Wood\u2019s conduct is grounds for a new trial under \u00a7 25-11-102(1), MCA, because it constituted an \u201cirregularity in the proceedings which prevents a party from having a fair trial.\u201d Horn also complains that because Wood did not disclose her employment at the gas station on her jury questionnaire, Horn \u201ccould not have expected that she would eventually provide expert testimony on gas station procedures to the other jurors during deliberations.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b528-5\">\u00b645 Bull River responds to those arguments by asserting that Horn\u2019s argument grossly mischaracterizes the information contained in the Ronning and Goodman affidavits. Wood did not conduct independent research or bring external information into the jury room, Bull River contends, but instead merely made permissible statements based on her personal knowledge. Because the information Wood discussed amounted to an internal influence and not an external influence, Bull River submits that the use of the Ronning and Goodman affidavits is improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-6\">\u00b646 As a general rule:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b528-7\">[A] juror may not testify as to any matter or statement occurring during the course of the jury\u2019s deliberations or to the effect of anything upon that or any other juror\u2019s mind or emotions as influencing the juror to assent or dissent from the verdict or indictment or concerning the juror\u2019s mental processes in connection therewith.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b528-8\">M. R. Evid. 606(b). Pertinent here, a juror is permitted to submit an affidavit calling into question the validity of a verdict if the affidavit concerns \u201cextraneous prejudicial information\u201d improperly brought to the jury\u2019s attention or \u201coutside influence\u201d brought to bear upon any juror. M. R. Evid. 606(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b528-9\">\u00b647 We have \u201cconsistently held that under Rule 606(b), M. R. Evid., the use of juror affidavits to impeach a jury verdict is limited to showing external influences on the jury.\u201d <em>Est. of Spicher v. Miller, </em>260 Mont. 504, 507, 861 P.2d 183, 185 (1993). In other words, \u201cjuror affidavits may not be used to impeach the verdict based upon internal influences on the jury,\u201d in part because \u201cjurors are expected to bring <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>to the courtroom their own knowledge and experience to aid in their resolution of the case.\u201d <em>Stebner v. Associated Materials, Inc., </em>2010 MT 138, \u00b6 16, 356 Mont. 520, 234 P.3d 94 (citing <em>Harry v. Elderkin, </em>196 Mont. 1, 8, 637 P.2d 809, 813 (1981) and quoting <em>State v. Kelman, </em>276 Mont. 253, 262, 915 P.2d 854, 860 (1996), respectively).</p>\n<p id=\"b529-3\">\u00b648 Horn maintains that Wood\u2019s comments during jury deliberations were an external influence because they present a similar factual situation to the one we analyzed in <em>Brockie v. Omo, </em>255 Mont. 495, 844 P.2d 61 (1992). In that case, the plaintiffs decedent was killed after the car in which he was riding skidded off the highway and struck a flasher board stationed on the highway median. <em>Brockie, </em>255 Mont. at 497, 844 P.2d at 62. The parties disputed whether or not the flasher board complied with a highway safety standard that \u201cprohibited] storage of a traffic control device within 30 feet\u201d of the highway. <em>Brockie, </em>255 Mont. at 497, 844 P.2d at 63. A highway patrol officer testified that the flasher board was parked \u201c27 feet 2 inches\u201d from the highway and the defendant\u2019s witness-an accident reconstruction expert-testified that the flasher board was \u201cbetween 34 and 48 feet\u201d from the highway. <em>Brockie, </em>255 Mont. at 497, 844 P.2d at 63. A juror later acknowledged that he had engaged in independent research at Carroll College\u2019s library to clarify the expert\u2019s testimony, which \u201cwas at the very heart of the evidence.\u201d <em>Brockie, </em>255 Mont. at 500, 844 P.2d at 64. We held that the juror\u2019s actions amounted to jury misconduct. <em>Brockie, </em>255 Mont. at 499, 844 P.2d at 64.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-4\">\u00b649 The facts presented in this case are not similar to those in <em>Brockie. </em>Whereas the juror in <em>Brockie </em>acknowledged engaging in independent research, Horn admits that \u201cit is unclear whether or not Ms. Wood had existing knowledge of Conoco\u2019s procedures or whether she researched or reviewed the procedures during trial.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b529-5\">\u00b650 The facts before us are more similar to those raised in <em>State v. Hage, </em>258 Mont. 498, 853 P.2d 1251 (1993). In that case, the defendant argued that he should be given a new trial because \u201c[a] juror informed the other jurors that he had personal knowledge that a telephone log was kept of all telephone calls made from the jail.\u201d <em>Hage, </em>258 Mont. at 507, 853 P.2d at 1256. We held that the juror\u2019s personal knowledge did not fall within any of the exceptions in Rule 606(b) because personal \u201cknowledge and information shared from one juror to another or others is not an extraneous influence.\u201d <em>Hage, </em>258 Mont. at 508-09, 853 P.2d at 1257.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-6\">\u00b651 There is no evidence that Wood ignored the District Court\u2019s repeated admonitions to the jury to refrain from independent investigation and brought extraneous information into the jury room. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>When a motion for a new trial is based on alleged jury misconduct, we \u201cwill not disturb a district court\u2019s decision absent a manifest abuse of discretion,\u201d which is \u201cone that is obvious, evident, or unmistakable.\u201d <em>Stebner, \u00b6 </em>11. Wood\u2019s statements were internal influences within the jury deliberations and her statement reflects precisely the type of personal knowledge and experience that is inadmissible under M. R. Evid. 606(b). <em>State v. Cooksey, </em>2012 MT 226, \u00b6\u00b6 17-19, 366 Mont. 346, 286 P.3d 1174.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-4\">\u00b652 Horn\u2019s complaint that he was \u201cnot aware of Ms. Wood\u2019s experience in the gas station industry prior to interviewing jurors after trial\u201d because Wood did not divulge that information on her jury questionnaire is unpersuasive. Horn does not advance any legal theory as to how omitting complete employment information from a jury questionnaire amounts to juror misconduct. In any event, Horn should have been alerted to Wood\u2019s relationship with the gas station industry from Wood\u2019s statements on the record during the trial. During <em>voir dire, </em>Wood answered, \u201cI get fuel from Moore Oil\u201d after Horn\u2019s counsel asked whether any of the jurors had ever worked for any of the companies involved in the litigation. Horn\u2019s counsel asked if she had ever had a problem with the fuel and if she had any concerns about whether \u201cthis is the right case\u201d for her to serve. Receiving negative responses, Horn\u2019s counsel moved on. Wood also asked the District Court during a trial recess, with counsel for both parties present, whether it was permissible for her to call Moore Oil during the trial to discuss a recent fuel purchase. Horn\u2019s counsel said that he had no objection to Wood doing so.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-5\">\u00b653 Although the record does not reflect that Wood ever stated specifically that she managed a gas station, she did indicate that she was in the business of purchasing fuel from Moore Oil, an oil and fuel supplier. It follows that Horn was put on notice as to Wood\u2019s possible relationship with the fuel industry.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-6\">\u00b654  We hold that, on the record before us, the District Court did not manifestly abuse its discretion when it denied Horn\u2019s motion for a new trial based on the alleged juror misconduct. Anna Wood\u2019s statement during jury deliberations regarding the policies in place at the gas station she managed was an internal influence that is not admissible to impeach the verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-7\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b530-8\">\u00b655  For this Court to reverse the denial of a motion for new trial, the trial court\u2019s \u201cabuse of discretion must be so significant as to materially affect the substantial rights of the party asserting error.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number><em>Clark v. Bell, </em>2009 MT 390, \u00b6 18, 353 Mont. 331, 220 P.3d 650. Horn has not demonstrated that, applying that standard, the District Court\u2019s denial of his motion for a new trial amounted to an abuse of discretion. <em>Stebner, </em>\u00b6 11. After a complete review of the record, we conclude that Horn has not shown prejudice to his substantial rights by virtue of any of the claimed errors properly preserved for appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-3\">\u00b656 The judgment of the District Court is affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b531-4\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES NELSON, MORRIS, COTTER, WHEAT and RICE concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
