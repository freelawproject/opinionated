A full factual recitation, procedural background and legal analysis is set forth in <em>Musselshell Ranch Co. v. Seidel-Joukova, </em>2011 MT 217, 362 Mont. 1, 261 P.3d 570 <em>(Musselshell Ranch I). </em>In this appeal, Musselshell Ranch and various individuals appeal the Fourteenth Judicial District Court\u2019s denial of their request for attorney fees. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-4\">ISSUE</p>\n<p id=\"b364-5\">\u00b62 The dispositive issue on appeal is:</p>\n<p id=\"b364-6\">\u00b63 Did the District Court err in denying attorney fees to the Ranch?</p>\n<p id=\"b364-7\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b364-8\">\u00b64 As noted above, an extensive factual background for this case is available in <em>Musselshell Ranch </em>7; however, for purposes of this Opinion, we provide a brief overview of pertinent facts. Plaintiffs/Appellants, i.e., Musselshell Ranch, the Cooleys and Rech (collectively the Ranch), own the right to appropriate water from the Musselshell River. The Ranch is the successor-in-interest to these rights which have been in place for more than 100 years with John Cooley being one of the original owners in 1891. The Ranch\u2019s water rights are utilized through an irrigation ditch generally known as the Cooley-Goffena Ditch (Cooley ditch). With minor alterations, the Cooley ditch has been in its current location consistently and continuously for more than 100 years.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-9\">\u00b65 The Cooley ditch is currently accessible by Ranch personnel via two routes \u2014 a northern route through Joukova\u2019s property entering a west end access gate, and a southern route created by the Montana Department of Transportation (MDOT) as part of MDOT\u2019s widening of Highway 12 in 2002. MDOT contoured the sides of the Cooley ditch and installed a lining and an underground pipeline as well as an east end access gate requested by the ditch users.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-10\">\u00b66 In 2006, defendant/appellee Nataliya Joukova purchased property through which a portion of the Cooley ditch flows. Shortly after taking possession of the property, Joukova graveled the two-lane road running along the north bank of the Cooley ditch that the Ranch had historically used to access the ditch. She also created an approach from the southern end across the pipeline installed by MDOT. She placed a permanent culvert in the Ranch\u2019s ditch and then covered it with a \u201csturdy rock bridge\u201d that allowed her to drive over the Cooley ditch to access another section of her property. These, and other actions by Joukova, sparked serious disagreements with Ranch personnel and in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>August 2009, the Ranch brought suit against Joukova claiming she was interfering with the Ranch\u2019s easement rights in violation of \u00a7\u00a7 70-17-101(11) and 70-17-112, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-3\">\u00b67 The District Court ruled in favor of Joukova on some issues and in favor of the Ranch on others. Specifically, the District Court concluded that the culvert and bridge could remain in place despite the Ranch\u2019s demand that it be removed. In response to the Ranch\u2019s claim that access to their ditch was blocked by a locked gate put in place by Joukova and that Joukova had removed a separate gate at the west end of the property, the court ruled that Joukova had to provide the Ranch with access through the locked gate and reinstall the removed gate. As a result of these and other rulings, the court concluded neither party had \u201cprevailed\u201d as required by \u00a7 70-17-112(5), MCA, and declined to award attorney fees and costs. Section 70-17-112, MCA, is the Montana statute expressly prohibiting interference with canal and ditch easements. Section 70-17-112(5), MCA, provides: \u201cIf alegal action is brought to enforce the provisions of this section, the prevailing party is entitled to costs and reasonable attorney\u2019s fees.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b365-4\">\u00b68 The Ranch appealed the District Court\u2019s ruling in favor of Joukova as to the culvert and bridge but it did not appeal the court\u2019s ruling pertaining to attorney fees. On appeal, this Court reversed the District Court and remanded the matter with instruction that Joukova remove the culvert and bridge. We concluded that the installation of the culvert and rock bridge interfered with the Ranch\u2019s secondary easement rights vis-\u00e1-vis the Cooley ditch.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-5\">\u00b69 On remand, the District Court ordered Joukova to remove the culvert and bridge. The Ranch then moved the District Court for its attorney fees and costs pursuant to \u00a7 70-17-112(5), MCA. Following oral argument on December 8, 2011, the District Court denied the Ranch\u2019s request on two grounds: (1) the Ranch could have, and should have, appealed the issue of attorney fees and costs on the first appeal; and (2) the Ranch had not prevailed on all issues raised under \u00a7 70-17-112, MCA, and therefore was not entitled to attorney fees and costs. The Ranch appeals this ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-6\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b365-7\">\u00b610 We review for correctness a district court\u2019s decision as to whether legal authority exists to award attorney fees. <em>Benintendi v. Hein, </em>2011 MT 298, \u00b6 16, 363 Mont. 32, 265 P.3d 1239.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-8\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b365-9\">\u00b611 <em>Did the District Court err in denying attorney fees to the </em>Ranch?</p>\n<p id=\"b366-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>\u00b612 The Ranch argues on appeal that it could not have appealed the court\u2019s original ruling denying fees and costs because, given the District Court\u2019s ruling allowing Joukova to retain the culvert and bridge over the Cooley ditch, it had not then prevailed on all issues pertaining to \u00a7 70-17-112, MCA; therefore, it was not entitled to fees and costs at that time. It maintains, however, that upon our favorable ruling issued in <em>Musselshell Ranch I, </em>it had prevailed on all issues pertaining to \u00a7 70-17-112, MCA, and was then entitled to fees and costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-4\">\u00b613 Joukova counters that the Ranch raised numerous claims under \u00a7 70-17-112, MCA, in the original law suit and that it did not prevail on all of them but chose not to appeal the loss of those claims, seeking to appeal only the retention of the culvert and bridge. We examine the issues raised by the Ranch at trial to determine whether those issues were raised pursuant to \u00a7 70-17-112, MCA, and whether the Ranch prevailed on those claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-5\">\u00b614 In the Complaint filed in August 2009, the Ranch asserted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b366-6\">In violation of [the Ranch\u2019s] ditch easement and rights granted pursuant to Montana statutes, [Joukova] has interfered with [the Ranch\u2019s] ditch easement, flow of water and the right to access up to 25 feet on either side of the canal for maintenance, cleaning and bank preservation purposes. Specifically [Joukova has] removed two 16 foot panels and by removing those panels, [the Ranch] cannot access the ditch bank when there is water in the ditch. [Joukova] further installed a culvert within the ditch, without consulting with or permission by the owners of the ditch easement impeding water flow. [Joukova] or her agents (John Does 1-5) have built a roadway on the bank of the irrigation ditch and have utilized heavy equipment including a dozer on the bank causing concern over deteriorating the banks infrastructure. [Joukova has] threatened physical harm to [the individual Ranch plaintiffs] and [the Ranch\u2019s] agents.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b366-7\">\u00b615 In its Complaint, the Ranch demanded that the District Court, pursuant to \u201c\u00a7 70-17-101(11), \u00a7 70-17-112(1) and (2), MCA, establish and declare that the [Ranch has] a permanent and perpetual right-of-way and easement over [Joukova\u2019s] lands for the Cooley-Goffena ditch and further [has] a permanent right of ingress and egress of [Joukova\u2019s] land ... for up to 25 feet on both sides of the canal for maintenance purposes.\u201d The Ranch further demanded that Joukova be \u201cordered to remove all obstructions and not to place any additional obstructions in the Cooley-Goffena ditch which may impede the flow of water\u201d and that she be permanently enjoined \u201cfrom interfering with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>[the Ranch\u2019s] access gates and other historical access for use and maintenance of the Cooley-Goffena ditch.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b367-3\">\u00b616 As the case developed, the Ranch challenged Joukova\u2019s right to drive and operate heavy equipment on the road along the northern bank of the ditch and to drive vehicles and heavy equipment over the highway approach built over the pipeline installed by the MDOT, claiming that such use could damage or weaken the ditch bank or underlying infrastructure.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-4\">\u00b617 In April 2010, the District Court issued a Pretrial Order setting forth the contentions of both parties. The Pretrial Order noted that the Ranch presented five<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> alleged actions by Joukova that constituted interference with the Ranch\u2019s easement: (a) removal of two 16-foot portable panels making access difficult or impossible; (b) removal of an access gate specifically installed by MDOT for the benefit of the ditch users and replaced with a continuously locked gate; (c) creation of a roadway on the north bank of the ditch which was constructed for the ditch users by the MDOT and was not designed to be used for vehicle and heavy equipment traffic; (d) placement of a culvert in the ditch which encroaches on the ditch and impedes the flow of water and hinders maintenance; and (e) threatened physical harm to individual Ranch plaintiffs and their agents when Ranch personnel entered Joukova\u2019s property for ditch maintenance purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-5\">\u00b618 In the court\u2019s June 2010 Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law and Order issued following trial, it determined that the placement of the culvert and bridge and Joukova\u2019s upgrade and utilization of the road adjacent to the Cooley ditch did not interfere with the Ranch\u2019s easement rights. The court concluded, however, that Joukova must replace the removed 16-foot panels and the removed gate at the west end of the property, and that she must allow access for Ranch personnel through both gates. The Ranch appealed the District Court\u2019s ruling on the culvert and bridge alone. This Court, as noted above, reversed the District Court on this issue and remanded with instruction that Joukova remove the culvert and bridge.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-6\">\u00b619 In summary, the Ranch ultimately prevailed on its claims pertaining to the 16-foot panels, the culvert and bridge, a replacement gate on the west end and unlimited access through both gates. It did not prevail on its claim that Joukova could not travel the gravel road along the north bank of the Cooley ditch.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>\u00b620 On appeal, the Ranch avers:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b368-4\">The allegation that Joukova constructed a roadway over the north bank of the Cooley-Goffena Ditch was not made under \u00a7 70-17-112(l)-(2), MCA. Although [the Ranch] sought relief on this point, the allegations against Joukova did not pertain to interference with [the Ranch\u2019s] secondary easement rights. Thus, the fact Joukova prevailed on this issue is not relevant to the recoverability of attorneys\u2019 fees and costs under \u00a7 70-17-112(5), MCA.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b368-5\">\u00b621 The record, however, reveals that the Ranch provided no independent legal basis for this claim; rather, this allegation was embedded within the Ranch\u2019s arguments under \u00a7 70-17-112, MCA, without distinction from the remaining easement arguments. There is no support, therefore, for a conclusion that this argument was posited under a separate and distinct legal theory.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-6\">\u00b622 We now turn to whether the Ranch may still be considered a \u201cprevailing party\u201d having prevailed on the majority but not all of the issues raised pertaining to Joukova\u2019s interference with its easement rights. We conclude under our precedent that it cannot.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-7\">\u00b623 We first addressed this issue in <em>Knudsen v. Taylor, </em>211 Mont. 459, 685 P.2d 354 (1984). In <em>Knudsen, </em>Taylor sued Knudsen alleging Knudsen failed to maintain his ditches properly, causing them to back up and seep onto Taylor\u2019s land. Taylor also accused Knudsen of removing a culvert that Taylor had installed to allow Taylor access to another section of his land. Knudsen filed a separate complaint arguing that Taylor was interfering with his ditch easement rights under \u00a7 70-17-112, MCA. <em>Knudsen, </em>211 Mont. at 460-61, 685 P.2d at 355. The cases were consolidated and a jury trial was conducted. The jury ruled in favor of both parties on different issues but Knudsen was awarded $10,000 to Taylor\u2019s $666.48. Claiming to be the prevailing party based upon the net judgment, Knudsen sought attorney fees and costs under \u00a7 70-17-112(5), MCA. <em>Knudsen, </em>211 Mont. at 461, 685 P.2d at 356. The district court denied the request and Knudsen appealed. We held on appeal that \u201cthe District Court was correct in finding in effect there was no prevailing party in the cause in the contemplation of Section 70-17-112(5), MCA, and properly denied attorney fees.\u201d <em>Knudsen, </em>211 Mont. at 464, 685 P.2d at 357.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-8\">\u00b624 Subsequently, in <em>Sharon v. Hayden, </em>246 Mont. 186, 803 P.2d 1083 (1990), Sharon sued Hayden, the holder of a ditch easement on Sharon\u2019s property, claiming Hayden \u201cunreasonably burdened his land by using heavy equipment to clear the irrigation ditch, constructing a roadway along the ditch and constructing gates at locations along <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>Sharon\u2019s fence line to allow access to the roadway.\u201d <em>Sharon, </em>246 Mont. at 187, 803 P.2d at 1084. Hayden answered seeking adjudication of his secondary easement rights and requested attorney fees under \u00a7 70-17-112(5), MCA. The district court granted Hayden all easement rights but ordered that each party bear their own fees and costs. <em>Sharon, </em>246 Mont. at 188, 803 P.2d at 1085. On appeal, we reversed the district court holding that Hayden had successfully enforced both \u00a7 70-17-112(1) and (2), MCA; therefore he was \u201centitled, as the prevailing party, to costs and reasonable attorney fees.\u201d <em>Sharon, </em>246 Mont. at 190, 803 P.2d at 1086. <em>See also Boylan v. Van Dyke, </em>247 Mont. 259, 266, 806 P.2d 1024, 1029 (1991) (\u201cHere, Mr Boylan failed to prevail in any of his claims.... [Defendants prevailed and are therefore entitled to costs and attorney fees as a matter of law.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b369-3\">\u00b625 In <em>Rieman v. Anderson, </em>282 Mont. 139, 935 P.2d 1122 (1997), we acknowledged that the district court had determined that Anderson was the prevailing party on \u201call issues\u201d pertaining to \u00a7 70-17-112, MCA, and was entitled to attorney fees. <em>Rieman, </em>282 Mont. at 148, 935 P.2d at 1127.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-4\">\u00b626 Notably, <em>in Engel v. Gampp, </em>2000 MT 17, 298 Mont. 116, 993 P.2d 701, we categorically stated \u201cIn order to be deemed a \u2018prevailing party for the purposes of \u00a7 70-17-112(5), MCA, we have strictly held that a party must successfully prevail on <em>all </em>claims raised pursuant to this statute.\u201d <em>Engel, </em>\u00b6 40. (Emphasis in original.) We have since reaffirmed this holding in <em>Espy v. Quinlan, </em>2000 MT 193, \u00b6 28, 300 Mont. 441, 4 P.3d 1212, <em>Graveley Simmental Ranch, Co. v. Quigley, </em>2003 MT 34, \u00b6 49, 314 Mont. 226, 65 P.3d 225, and <em>Byrum v. Andren, </em>2007 MT 107, \u00b6 67, 337 Mont. 167, 159 P.3d 1062.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-5\">\u00b627  This line of cases unequivocally establishes that a \u201cprevailing party\u201d under \u00a7 70-17-112(5), MCA, must prevail on all claims raised pursuant to \u00a7 70-17-112, MCA. In the case before us, the Ranch, while prevailing on the majority of claims, did not prevail on <em>all </em>claims. As such it is not entitled to fees and costs under \u00a7 70-17-112(5), MCA. \u00b628 Having determined the Ranch is not entitled to attorney fees and costs as a matter of law, we need not address the District Court\u2019s ruling that the Ranch should have appealed the fee issue during <em>Musselshell Ranch I.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b369-6\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b369-7\">\u00b629 For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the District Court\u2019s denial of Musselshell Ranch\u2019s request for attorney fees.</p>\n<judges id=\"b369-8\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES BAKER and NELSON concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b367-7\"> We acknowledge that six specific actions were listed in the Pretrial Order, including a challenge to Joukova\u2019s creation and use of an access approach from the south. This particular challenge was dismissed by the District Court prior to trial.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b370-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>JUSTICE RICE,</author>\n<p id=\"AgA\">concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-4\">\u00b630 I concur with the Court\u2019s opinion because it accurately applies the law regarding attorney fees under \u00a7 70-17-112(5), MCA, including the principle stated in \u00b6 26 of the Opinion that \u201cwe have strictly held that a party must successfully prevail on <em>all </em>claims raised pursuant to this statute\u201d in order to qualify for fees. <em>Engel, </em>\u00b6 40. (Emphasis in original.) \u00b631 That said, I harbor doubts about <em>Engel\u2019s </em>holding in this regard. I fail to see why a party who prevails in an action \u201cto enforce the provisions\u201d of \u00a7 70-17-112(5), MCA, as Musselshell Ranch did here, should not be entitled to a statutory fee award. At a minimum, the trial court should be able to determine, under the usual standards, whether the party seeking enforcement is the \u201cprevailing party\u201d of the entire litigation and thus entitled to fees. <em>See Avanta Fed. Credit Union v. Shupak, </em>2009 MT 458, \u00b6\u00b6 45-50, 354 Mont. 372, 223 P.3d 863. However, <em>Engel\u2019s </em>holding has been affirmed in subsequent cases by this Court, and until the Legislature addresses the issue or a persuasive argument is made for this Court to overturn precedent, I believe <em>stare decisis </em>requires that Musselshell Ranch\u2019s claim for fees be denied.</p>\n<judges id=\"b370-5\">JUSTICE NELSON joins in the concurring opinion of JUSTICE RICE.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b370-6\">JUSTICE NELSON,</author>\n<p id=\"Ays\">concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-7\">\u00b632 Based on <em>Engel v. Gampp, </em>2000 MT 17, \u00b6 40, 298 Mont. 116, 993 P.2d 701, and the line of authority discussed at \u00b6\u00b6 23-26 of today\u2019s Opinion, I concur in the Court\u2019s conclusion that since the Ranch did not prevail on <em>all </em>of the claims it brought under \u00a7 70-17-112, MCA, it was not entitled to attorney\u2019s fees as the \u201cprevailing party\u201d in this litigation pursuant to \u00a7 70-17-112(5), MCA. That is the current state of the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-8\">\u00b633 That said, if the Ranch views our decision here as adding insult to its injury, I can certainly commiserate with that sentiment. The Ranch did prevail on its main claim under the statute-forcing Joukova to remove her culvert and rock bridge which she had unlawfully constructed in the Ranch\u2019s irrigation ditch.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-9\">\u00b634 In <em>Musselshell Ranch I, </em>I strongly criticized and dissented from this Court\u2019s determination to judicially rewrite \u00a7 70-17-112(2), MCA, so as to add, among other things, this Court\u2019s own \u201cpublic policy\u201d determinations to the otherwise plain and unambiguous text of the statute. <em>Musselshell Ranch I, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 75-77, 81 (Nelson, J., concurring in the result but dissenting from the reasoning). I pointed out that this Court\u2019s decision placed irrigators in an untenable position. I observed that \u201c[t]here is no reason, much less any legal basis, why owners of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>canal or ditch easements should have to defend, as they henceforth must, their statutory easement rights from the \u2018interference\u2019 (reasonable or otherwise) of every hobby rancher with 20 acres and a horse.\u201d <em>Musselshell Ranch I, </em>\u00b6 82 (Nelson, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b371-3\">\u00b635 If irrigators expect to retain the full measure of the ditch and canal rights they once enjoyed, it will be up to the next session of the Legislature to amend \u00a7 70-17-112, MCA, so as to correct the damage to the statute done by this Court\u2019s judicial rewriting of it. <em>See Musselshell Ranch I, </em>\u00b6 85 (Nelson, J., dissenting). And, lest the importance of amending the statute be lost on irrigators, they should keep in mind that this Court also took the position in <em>Musselshell Ranch I </em>that if the Legislature <em>does nothing </em>this next session to fix \u00a7 70-17-112, MCA, then this Court will \u201cpresume\u201d that the Legislature agrees with our decision to rewrite the statute. <em>See Musselshell Ranch I, </em>\u00b6 14 (Court\u2019s opinion), \u00b6\u00b6 53-59 (Nelson, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b371-4\">\u00b636 Finally, in amending \u00a7 70-17-112, MCA, the Legislature may also wish to include a revised attorney\u2019s fees provision in the statute. In future cases, where the irrigator successfully litigates an unlawful encroachment upon or impairment to its ditch or canal rights, the irrigator should be awarded its costs and reasonable attorney\u2019s fees for prevailing on its main claim under the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-5\">\u00b637 With these caveats, I concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
