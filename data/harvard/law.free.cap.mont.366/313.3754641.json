We affirm the District Court and address the issues:</p>\n<p id=\"b340-8\">\u00b62 <em>1. Did the Department properly preserve its evidentiary arguments for appeal ?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b340-10\">\u00b63 <em>2. Did the District Court err by concluding that Reed\u2019s conduct constituted misconduct under the \u201ccarelessness standard\u201d of Admin. R. M. 24.11.460(l)(d)?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b340-11\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b340-12\">\u00b64 Reed worked as a deli clerk for Gary &amp; Leo\u2019s Fresh Food, Inc. (Gary &amp; Leo\u2019s), a Havre grocery store, from February 22, 2009, until October 16,2010. Reed\u2019s job consisted offilling shoppers\u2019 orders for deli items, such as sliced meats, salads, sandwiches, fried food, and coffee. Gary &amp; Leo\u2019s terminated Reed\u2019s employment on October 16,2010, after receiving complaints from shoppers regarding poor service and use of inappropriate language by Reed.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-13\">\u00b65 Reed applied for unemployment insurance benefits. The Department initially determined that Reed was eligible for benefits, but after Gary &amp; Leo\u2019s requested a redetermination, it concluded that Reed was not qualified for benefits because she had been discharged for misconduct. Reed appealed and a hearing was conducted by a hearing officer on April 14, 2011.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-14\">\u00b66 At the hearing, Gary <em>&amp; </em>Leo\u2019s manager Tracy Job testified that he had been prompted to fire Reed because of multiple customer complaints, a number of which were memorialized in her personnel file as reports. The first report was dated March 14, 2009, and was signed by a customer who said that Reed acted rudely toward her. The second and third reports, dated March 14,2010, and May 1,2010, documented similar complaints from other customers. The fourth report, dated October 12,2010, documented a \u201cvery upset\u201d customer who complained after Reed \u201cwas swearing and saying she didn\u2019t know how to make a meat and cheese tray.\u201d The fifth report, also dated October 12, 2010, documented a customer complaint that Reed was \u201cextremely rude\u201d and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>\u201cobviously didn\u2019t want to help her in any way.\u201d Reed said that she had no objection to these reports, and the hearing officer admitted them into evidence.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Reed testified and denied the allegations contained in the reports. While Reed admitted to using profane language at work, she testified that she did so out of earshot of customers.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-3\">\u00b67 The hearing officer found that five customer complaints regarding Reed\u2019s service had been made in her year-and-a-half employment with Gary &amp; Leo\u2019s. However, the hearing officer concluded that Reed had not intentionally acted rudely toward customers. Citing Admin. R. M. 24.11.460(l)(a}-(b), the hearing officer noted that misconduct was defined as the \u201cdeliberate disregard of the employer\u2019s rights and interests or the deliberate disregard of employee standards of behavior the employer had the right to expect.\u201d While Reed had been issued written warnings regarding her rude behavior toward or in front of customers, the hearing officer concluded that Reed had not been deliberately rude and reinstated benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-4\">\u00b68 Gary &amp; Leo\u2019s appealed to the Board, arguing that the hearing officer erred by failing to apply an alternate definition of misconduct contained in subsection (d) of the Admin. R. M. 24.11.460(1), which provides that misconduct also includes: \u201ccarelessness or negligence of such degree or reoccurrence to show an intentional or substantial disregard of the employer\u2019s interest\u201d (hereinafter \u201ccarelessness standard\u201d). The Board affirmed, reasoning that the hearing officer was in the best position to judge the credibility of the parties and had \u201ccorrectly applied the law to the facts.\u201d The Board briefly mentioned the carelessness standard but its analysis of the misconduct issue focused on a different definition of misconduct under the regulations. \u00b69 Gary &amp; Leo\u2019s petitioned for judicial review, arguing the Board had erred by failing to address Reed\u2019s conduct under the carelessness standard. The Department and the Board filed a joint notice of non-participation indicating they would not be participating in the proceeding but reserving the right to intervene if issues arose pertaining to them. In addition, the notice addressed the standards of review and their application to the case. Reed did not participate in the proceeding. Gary &amp; Leo\u2019s filed an opening brief, serving Reed and the Department, and likewise filed and served a reply brief after Reed\u2019s and the Department\u2019s response time expired.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>\u00b610 The District Court reversed the Board\u2019s decision, holding that Reed\u2019s conduct as established by the hearing officer\u2019s findings of fact constituted misconduct as a matter of law under the carelessness standard:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b342-4\">[A]pplying the law to the facts as determined by the hearing officer, the substantial evidence in the record establishes that Reed acted with a careless or negligent disregard of the employer\u2019s interest. The legal conclusions of the hearings officer and the [Board] constitute an error of law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b342-5\">The court reasoned that Reed failed to correct behavior for which she was on notice and which related to the employer\u2019s interests:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b342-6\">The administrative record demonstrates repeated warnings to Reed about her inappropriate behavior to or around customers with no demonstrated effort to correct it after the warnings. Reed admitted to an ongoing anger problem. Her employer is a customer service business-employee misconduct toward customers is a legitimate concern of the employer.... Reed was discharged for misconduct.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b342-7\">Following this ruling, the Department and the Board filed a joint motion to alter the court\u2019s judgment, arguing the District Court had cited to the wrong statute in applying the standard of review. Gary &amp; Leo\u2019s agreed and the District Court revised its order to cite to the correct statute. This revision did not change the outcome as a substantially similar standard of review is provided under both statutes.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b342-8\">\u00b611 The Department appeals the District Court\u2019s ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-9\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b342-10\">\u00b612 In unemployment insurance cases, this Court reviews the factual findings to determine if they are supported by substantial evidence. <em>Wheelsmith Fabrication v. Mont. Dept. of Lab. &amp; Indus., </em>2000 MT 27, \u00b6 8, 298 Mont. 187, 993 P.2d 713. \u201cWith regard to questions of law, however, our task is to determine whether the agencys interpretation of the law is correct.\u201d <em>Wheelsmith, </em>\u00b6 8. Whether an employee\u2019s conduct <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>constitutes misconduct is a question of law which this Court reviews for correctness. <em>Mont. Dept. of Corrections v. Dept. of Lab. &amp; Indus., </em>2006 MT 298, \u00b6 14, 334 Mont. 425, 148 P.3d 619 <em>(citing Hafner v. Mont. Dept. of Lab. &amp; Indus., </em>280 Mont. 95, 100, 929 P.2d 233, 236 (1996)).</p>\n<p id=\"b343-3\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b343-4\">\u00b613 <em>1. Did the Department properly preserve its evidentiary arguments for appeal ?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b343-5\">\u00b614 The Department offers that the hearing officer and the Board gave no weight to the five customer complaints against Reed because the complaints constituted \u201cinadmissible hearsay.\u201d The Department argues that the District Court erred by considering this evidence, and that the court thus impermissibly re-weighed the evidence in determining that Reed\u2019s actions constituted misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-6\">\u00b615 Gary &amp; Leo\u2019s urges the Court to reject the Department\u2019s arguments as untimely and not properly before the Court. It argues that, because the Department notified the District Court that it would not participate in the proceedings and did not answer the briefing, the Department failed to preserve the issues raised in its appeal. The Department counters that it preserved the issues by way of the discussion provided in its notice of non-participation, reservation of the right to re-enter the case, and motion to alter or amend the judgment. \u00b616 \u201cIn Montana, the general rule is that an issue which is presented for the first time to the Supreme Court is untimely and cannot be considered on appeal.\u201dDay <em>v. Payne, </em>280 Mont. 273, 276-77, 929 P.2d 864, 866 (1997). This rule is applied in unemployment insurance proceedings, <em>Wheelsmith, </em>\u00b6 12, and is rooted in fundamental fairness to the parties and to the trial court, <em>Day, </em>280 Mont. at 276-77, 929 P.2d at 688. Similarly, motions to alter or amend a judgment \u201ccannot be used to raise arguments which could, and should, have been made before judgment issued.\u201d <em>Nelson v. Driscoll, </em>285 Mont. 355, 360-61, 948 P.2d 256, 259 (1997) (citations omitted); <em>accord Lee v. USAA Casualty Ins., </em>2001 MT 59, \u00b6 76, 304 Mont. 356, 22 P.3d 631; <em>Cook v. Hartman, </em>2003 MT 251, \u00b6 24, 317 Mont. 343, 77 P.3d 231.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-7\">\u00b617  While addressing the issue of substantial evidence generally, the Department did not make the inadmissible hearsay argument in its notice of non-participation. To the extent that the Department attempted to raise the hearsay argument in its motion to alter or amend, that attempt falls squarely within the prohibition stated in <em>Nelson, Lee, </em>and <em>Cook. </em>In sum, the Department failed to properly raise and preserve its inadmissible hearsay argument in the District Court. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>Thus, its argument that the five reports of customer complaints, though admitted by the hearing officer, were inadmissible hearsay and not to be considered, are not properly before this Court, and the reports remain a part of the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-4\">\u00b618 <em>2. Did the District Court err by determining that the evidence found by the Department constituted misconduct as a matter of law under the \u201ccarelessness standard\u201d of Admin. R. M. 24.11.460(l)(d)? </em>\u00b619 The Department argues that the District Court erred in concluding that Reed had been discharged for misconduct. Giving the Department the benefit of the doubt that this issue was preserved by the substantial evidence discussion which accompanied its notice of non-participation,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the Department\u2019s argument nonetheless assumes that the customer complaint reports were inadmissible and could not be considered. It argues that \u201cno credible, admissible evidence substantiates any alleged customer complaints about Reed\u2019s job performance.\u201d However, as we concluded under the first issue, the admissibility of the customer complaints was not an issue which was preserved.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-5\">\u00b620 The hearing officer entered findings of fact that Gary &amp; Leo\u2019s received five complaints regarding poor customer service provided by Reed during her employment. The Board affirmed these findings of fact as supported by the evidence. As noted above, whether these facts constitute misconduct as defined by Admin. R. M. 24.11.460 is a question of law. Further, we apply a deferential review of the Board\u2019s interpretation of its regulations in light of its \u201cconsiderable expertise\u201d in these matters. <em>Somont Oil Co. v. King, </em>2012 MT 207, \u00b6 18, 366 Mont. 251, 286 P.3d 585.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-6\">\u00b621 However, the Board gave little attention to Gary &amp; Leo\u2019s argument about the carelessness standard of misconduct, even though that was the only issue Gary &amp; Leo\u2019s counsel argued to the Board. Like the analysis provided by the hearing officer, the Board\u2019s citation to the governing regulations included only an alternate definition of misconduct. The Board briefly referenced the carelessness standard in its order but did not offer an analysis regarding why the findings of fact regarding Reed\u2019s actions did not constitute misconduct under the carelessness standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>\u00b622  The findings of fact established that there were multiple complaints about Reed\u2019s use of language and poor customer service, five which had been reduced to written reports, culminating in two complaints from customers on the same day. Reed had been repeatedly warned in writing. We affirm the District Court\u2019s conclusion of law that Reed\u2019s conduct as established by the findings constituted carelessness or negligence in disregard of Gary &amp; Leo\u2019s interest in providing service to its retail customers under Admin. R. M. 24.11.460(l)(d), and that the Board erred in its legal conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-4\">\u00b623 This case differs from <em>Somont Oil Co., </em>where we affirmed the Board\u2019s determination that an employee\u2019s conduct did not rise to the level of misconduct. <em>Somont Oil Co., </em>\u00b6\u00b6 20-21. We noted that the Board \u201ccited evidence in its written opinion and during its hearing\u201d to support its conclusion that the employee\u2019s conduct \u201camounted, at most, to isolated negligence.\u201d <em>Somont Oil Co., </em>\u00b6 20. The record in <em>Somont Oil Co. </em>supported the Board\u2019s determination that the employee was terminated for \u201cisolated\u201d behavior. <em>Somont Oil Co., </em>\u00b6 20. In this case, the record indicates that Reed\u2019s conduct was recurring, even after she was repeatedly warned in writing. Further, while the Board cited evidence to support its conclusion in <em>Somont Oil Co., </em>here the Board failed to analyze the evidence of Reed\u2019s conduct under the carelessness standard found in Admin. R. M. 24.11.460(l)(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b345-5\">\u00b624 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b345-6\">JUSTICES COTTER, NELSON, WHEAT and BAKER concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b341-5\"> Reed objected to one report written by a fellow employee on the ground that he had not worked the day of the incident.
