Longjaw (Longjaw) of aggravated burglary and sexual intercourse without consent in the Fourth Judicial District Court. Longjaw argues his convictions should be reversed because his standby counsel had a conflict of interest, the District Court erred by modifying the jury instructions regarding aggravated burglary during jury deliberations, and his counsel was ineffective for failing to obtain an independent medical expert. The State concedes reversible error on the instruction issue and requests that Longjaw\u2019s conviction for aggravated burglary be vacated on that basis. Because Longjaw was also convicted of sexual intercourse without consent, we must undertake review of the remaining two issues:</p>\n<p id=\"b499-5\">\u00b62 <em>1. Did Defendant\u2019s standby counsel have an active conflict of interest that requires reversal of the Defendant\u2019s sexual intercourse without consent conviction?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b499-6\">\u00b63 <em>2. Did the Defendant\u2019s counsel render ineffective assistance by failing to obtain an independent medical expert to aid in the defense?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b499-7\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b499-8\">\u00b64 Longj aw was charged in December 2009 with aggravated burglary and sexual intercourse without consent. Longjaw forced his way into the apartment of a mentally disabled woman with whom he was acquainted and sexually assaulted her. The victim\u2019s daughter called the police to request a welfare check on her mother. When the police arrived at the apartment, they found Longjaw asleep and intoxicated in the living room. The victim said Longjaw ripped off her bra and forced her to have sex with him and repeatedly asked the officers to remove Longjaw from her apartment. The victim was examined by a registered nurse from the First Step sexual assault program at St. Patrick\u2019s Hospital in Missoula. The registered nurse found that the victim\u2019s injuries were inconsistent with consensual sex.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-9\">\u00b65 Longjaw was convicted of both charges after a jury trial in the Fourth Judicial District Court, Missoula County, in September 2010. The District Court sentenced Longjaw to 40 years in the Montana State Prison for aggravated burglary and 60 years in the Montana State Prison for sexual intercourse without consent, the sentences to run concurrently.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-10\">\u00b66 Longjaw was represented by several attorneys during pre-trial proceedings. Longjaw was first represented by Katie Green from the Office of the Public Defender, but due to a conflict of interest between Longjaw and another client of the office, William Boggs was contracted to represent Longjaw as conflict counsel. Disagreements between <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>Boggs and Longjaw arose, and the case was assigned to Jordan Kilby and Gregory Hood of the Office of the Public Defender. The record indicates there were personality conflicts within these attorney-client relationships. On August 20,2010, Longjaw filed a motion for leave to represent himself. The District Court conducted a hearing on August 24 on Longjaw\u2019s motion and thereafter denied the request. On August 31, Longjaw renewed his request, and after questioning Longjaw and determining that Longjaw understood the dangers associated with self-representation, the District Court granted his request and directed that Kilby and Hood would act as standby counsel for the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-4\">\u00b67 On the morning of trial, Kilby and Hood informed the District Court that a witness on the State\u2019s witness list, Jennifer Haygood (Haygood), had previously been represented by their regional public defender office on a different but tangentially related matter, which presented a potential conflict of interest. Kilby said, \u201cI think even as standby counsel we might have a problem. But it is our agency\u2019s position that we don\u2019t,\u201d adding that the potential conflict had been through two levels of review by the Office of the Public Defender. The court stated it did not have an opinion on the conflict at that point and would have to think about it further. The State indicated it would not call Haygood as a witness. No further inquiry was made by the court, and the case proceeded to trial. During trial, Longjaw called Haygood as a witness and questioned her briefly.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-5\">\u00b68 In response to Longjaw\u2019s expressed concerns about obtaining a second medical opinion and other issues, the District Court conducted a hearing on April 29, 2010. Boggs, who was then representing Longjaw, explained that, in his view, a second opinion might not be necessary because he anticipated that an interview with the medical staff at First Step would \u201cobviate the need for a second opinion, but I\u2019m not certain of that.\u201d Boggs indicated he was not then inclined to request a second opinion, stating \u201cI\u2019m not going to do it unless the Court orders me to, unless I think it\u2019s important to the case to get a second opinion. And I\u2019m just not in a position to know that yet.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b500-6\">\u00b69 During jury deliberations, the jury sent a note to the court asking for clarification on jury instruction number 7, which read: \u201c[a] person commits the offense of aggravated burglary if the person knowingly enters <em>and </em>remains unlawfully in an occupied structure ...\u201d (emphasis added). The court sent a note to the jury changing jury instruction number 7 to read: \u201c[a] person commits the offense of aggravated burglary if the person knowingly enters <em>or </em>remains unlawfully in an occupied structure ...\u201d (emphasis in original). The court similarly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>modified the language injury instruction number 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-4\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b501-5\">\u00b610 <em>1. Did the Defendant\u2019s standby counsel have an active conflict of interest that requires reversal of the Defendant\u2019s sexual intercourse without consent conviction?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b501-6\">\u00b611 Criminal defendants are guaranteed the right to assistance of counsel through the Sixth Amendment of the United States Constitution and Article II, Section 24 of the Montana Constitution. <em>State v. St. Dennis, </em>2010 MT 229, \u00b6 28, 358 Mont. 88, 244 P.3d 292 (citing <em>Kills On Top v. State, </em>2000 MT 340, \u00b6 37, 303 Mont. 164, 15 P.3d 422). The right to \u201cconflict-free representation\u201d guaranteed in the Sixth Amendment is applied to the states through the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. <em>St. Dennis, </em>\u00b6 28. We review the conflict of interest issue <em>de novo. St. Dennis, </em>\u00b6 19.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-7\">\u00b612 The State notes a conflict of authority nationally on the question of whether the right to conflict-free representation extends to standby counsel and the absence of Montana precedent on the point. Longjaw argues that the right should extend to standby counsel and offers <em>Washington v. McDonald, </em>22 P.3d 791 (Wash. 2001), in support. In <em>McDonald, </em>the Supreme Court of Washington extended the right of conflict-free representation to standby counsel, holding that prejudice is presumed and reversal is required when an actual conflict existed or when the trial court reasonably should have known about a conflict but failed to properly inquire into the conflict. <em>McDonald, </em>22 P.3d at 795. Longjaw urges adoption of the rules stated in <em>McDonald, </em>arguing that \u201cwhere counsel raises an issue of conflict of interest to the district court, reversal should be automatic because of the fundamental seriousness of a Sixth Amendment violation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b501-8\">\u00b613 However, the central issue briefed by the parties, which we deem dispositive, is whether an actual conflict existed in this case. Thus, assuming arguendo that the right to conflict-free representation extends to standby counsel, we turn to that central issue. We decline to address further, as unnecessary under these facts, the various rules and analyses adopted by Washington and other jurisdictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-9\">\u00b614 Noting \u201cthe unique nature of public defender offices as opposed to private law firms,\u201d we held that \u201cthe better approach for analyzing purported conflicts of interest within [the Office of the Public Defender] is the case-by-case approach.\u201d <em>St. Dennis, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 30, 32. \u201cUnder the case-by-case approach, if defendant proves that an actual conflict exists, he or she must then demonstrate that counsel\u2019s performance was adversely affected by the conflict.\u201d <em>St. Dennis, </em>\u00b6 29 <em>(citing Illinois </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number><em>v. Morales, </em>808 N.E.2d 510, 514-15 (Ill. 2004)). <em>See also Thurston v. State, </em>2004 MT 142, \u00b6 17, 321 Mont. 411, 91 P.3d 1259 (\u201c[a] defendant claiming ineffective assistance of counsel due to a conflict of interest must show: (1) that counsel actively represented conflicting interests; and (2) that an actual conflict of interest adversely affected counsel\u2019s performance.\u201d). If we determine no actual conflict existed, \u201cwe need not examine counsel\u2019s performance to determine if such performance was adversely affected by the ostensible conflict.\u201d <em>St. Dennis, </em>\u00b6 37.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-4\">\u00b615 We have explained that \u201c[a]n actual conflict, as opposed to the mere possibility of a conflict, is necessary.\u201d <em>State v. Deschon, </em>2002 MT 16, \u00b6 18, 308 Mont. 175, 40 P.3d 391 <em>(Deschon I). </em>\u201cA defense attorney has an actual conflict when he is required to make a choice advancing another client\u2019s interests to the detriment of his client\u2019s interest.\u201d <em>Deschon I, </em>\u00b6 18 (citing <em>U.S. v. Gantt, </em>140 F.3d 249, 254 (D.C. Cir. 1998)) (citation omitted). In <em>St. Dennis, </em>we cited the discussion concerning potential and actual conflicts provided in <em>People v. Christian, </em>41 Cal. App. 4th 986 (Cal. 1996). <em>St. Dennis, </em>\u00b6 33. <em>Christian </em>explained that \u201c[t]here is a possibility of conflict, then, if the interest of the defendants may diverge at some point so as to place the attorney under inconsistent duties. There is an actual, relevant conflict of interests if, during the course of the representation, the defendants\u2019 interests do diverge with respect to a material factual or legal issue or to a course of action.\u201d <em>Christian, </em>41 Cal. App. 4th at 992 (quoting <em>Cuyler v. Sullivan, </em>446 U.S. 335, 100 S. Ct. 1708 (1980)).</p>\n<p id=\"b502-5\">\u00b616 Longjaw argues a conflict of interest existed because his standby counsel previously represented Haygood in another matter, described by Hood as \u201ctangentially\u201d related to Haygood\u2019s involvement in this case. In response to defense counsel\u2019s concerns about a potential conflict, the State confirmed its position that, though Haygood had been listed as a witness, it would not call her to testify, and the State did not do so. Representing himself at trial, Longjaw called Haygood to testify. Longjaw questioned her briefly and the record reveals no involvement by standby counsel regarding Haygood, nor is any such involvement asserted by Longjaw.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-6\">\u00b617  \u201cA defense attorney has an actual conflict when he is required to make a choice advancing another client\u2019s interests to the detriment of his client\u2019s interest.\u201d <em>Deschon I, </em>\u00b6 18 (citation omitted). Although a potential conflict may have been present here, we conclude that the circumstances did not progress to an actual conflict wherein standby counsel were required to make a choice to the detriment of Longjaw\u2019s interests. Where there is no actual conflict, we need not \u201cexamine counsel\u2019s performance to determine if such performance was adversely <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>affected by the ostensible conflict.\u201d <em>St. Dennis, </em>\u00b6 37.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-4\">\u00b618 <em>2. Did the Defendant\u2019s counsel render ineffective assistance by failing to obtain an independent medical expert to aid in the </em>defense? \u00b619 \u201cIn considering ineffective assistance of counsel claims on direct appeal, we apply the two-pronged test set forth by the United States Supreme Court in <em>Strickland v. Washington </em>(1984), 466 U.S. 668, 104 S. Ct. 2052.\u201d <em>State v. Deschon, </em>2004 MT 32, \u00b6 31, 320 Mont. 1, 85 P.3d 756 <em>(Deschon II). </em>The defendant must establish (1) \u201cthat counsel\u2019s performance was deficient or fell below an objective standard of reasonableness,\u201d and (2) \u201cprejudice by demonstrating that there was a reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different.\u201d <em>Deschon II, </em>\u00b6 31. This Court may review a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel on direct appeal only when the record \u201cfully explains why counsel took, or failed to take, action in providing a defense for the accused.\u201d <em>Deschon II, </em>\u00b6 32. \u00b620  In <em>State v. White, </em>2001 MT 149, \u00b6 20, 306 Mont. 58, 30 P.3d 340, we explained that \u201cthe definitive question that distinguishes and decides which actions are record and which are non-record, is <em>whyl... </em>[D]oes the record fully explain <em>why </em>counsel took the particular course of action?\u201d (Emphasis in original.) When ineffective assistance of counsel claims are non-record based, the proper avenue for review is through a petition for postconviction relief. <em>State v. Webster, </em>2005 MT 38, \u00b6 9, 326 Mont. 112, 107 P.3d 500.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-5\">\u00b621 Longjaw ultimately represented himself at trial but claims that his counsel\u2019s earlier failure to obtain an independent medical expert \u201cto review the records of the physical examination of the alleged victim and to testify at trial\u201d constitutes ineffective assistance.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-6\">\u00b622 The record reveals that, at the April 29, 2010, hearing, then-counsel Boggs indicated an independent medical expert may not be necessary because he believed the necessary information could be obtained by examination of the medical providers. Longjaw was represented by three other attorneys, but this statement by counsel Boggs is the only reference by counsel to the issue in the record. Thus, the record does not fully explain \u201cwhy\u201d an independent medical examination or expert was not ultimately obtained by Longjaw\u2019s counsel, and the claim cannot be reviewed on appeal. Longjaw may pursue the claim in postconviction relief proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-7\">\u00b623 In response to Longjaw\u2019s challenge to the District Court\u2019s revision of the jury instructions for aggravated burglary during the jury\u2019s deliberations, the State \u201cconcedes under the particular facts presented in this record that Longj aw\u2019s aggravated burglary conviction should be reversed.\u201d We therefore reverse Longjaw\u2019s conviction for aggravated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>battery.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-4\">\u00b624 Longjaw\u2019s conviction for sexual intercourse without consent is affirmed. His conviction for aggravated burglary is reversed. We remand this matter for entry of an amended judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-5\">\u00b625 Affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b504-6\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES COTTER and MORRIS concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"b504-7\">JUSTICE NELSON</author>\n<p id=\"Am_\">concurring in part and dissenting in part.</p>\n<p id=\"A96\">\u00b626 I concur with the Court\u2019s decision to vacate Longjaw\u2019s conviction for aggravated burglary, and with the Court\u2019s decision to affirm on Issue 2. However, I dissent from Issue 1 because I disagree with the Court\u2019s conclusion that the trial court adequately inquired into the conflict of interest raised by Longjaw\u2019s standby counsel. In my view, standby counsel has the same obligations to avoid conflicts of interest as do appointed or retained counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-8\">\u00b627 In this case, the State asserted in its brief on appeal that standby counsel \u201cnever announced they had conflicts of interest.\u201d A review of the transcript in this case clearly shows that the contrary is true.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-9\">\u00b628 Prior to the start of trial, Ms. Kilby and Mr. Hood from the Region 2 Office of Public Defender (OPD), who were acting as standby counsel, informed the Court that there was a witness on the State\u2019s witness list, Jennifer Haygood, who had been represented by the Region 2 OPD on a matter related to Longjaw\u2019s case. Ms. Kilby and Mr. Hood informed the court that although the State may not call Haygood as a witness, Longjaw wanted to call her as a witness. Haygood was the daughter of the victim in this case. Ms. Kilby and Mr. Hood expressed concern that, in their opinions, a conflict of interest existed. The entire colloquy between the court and counsel follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b504-10\">MS. KILBY: [Jennifer Haygood] is on the State\u2019s Witness and Exhibit List. However, it was our understanding the State was not going to call her; the reason being our office has represented Ms. Haygood in the past. We, Mr. Hood and I, took this issue through two levels of review. It\u2019s our agency\u2019s belief that this is not a conflict of interest. We did, however, just want to bring the issue to the Court in case the Court felt otherwise.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b504-11\">THE COURT: Well, at this point you\u2019re simply standby counsel. And I\u2019m not going to stop Mr. Long Jaw [sic], as long as he\u2019s his own attorney, from putting on a defense or calling what witnesses he thinks are appropriate.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b504-12\">MS. KILBY: Certainly. And that wouldn\u2019t be what we were requesting. We wanted to get-</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b504-13\">MR. HOOD: We wanted to put the Court on notice in case <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>something happens where we are put back on the case and a conflict does exist. You know, we just wanted to alert the Court to the possibility of that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b505-4\">THE COURT: All right. Well, did you represent her in connection with anything that she\u2019ll be testifying about.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b505-5\">MR. HOOD: Tangentially, yes, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b505-6\">MS. KILBY: And, Your Honor, like I said, we\u201911-7 <em>think even as standby counsel we might have a problem. </em>But it is our agency\u2019s position that we don\u2019t. We have been through two levels of review but, if the Court feels otherwise, then-</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b505-7\">THE COURT: At this point, I don\u2019t have an opinion. So I guess, Mr. Marks, do you have anything you want to add on that point?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b505-8\">MR. MARKS: Your Honor, I don\u2019t believe there\u2019s a problem as long as Mr. Long Jaw\u2019s [sic] representing himself. As Ms. Kilby said, I do not intend to call Ms. Haygood in my case, but I don\u2019t see any reason the defendant can\u2019t.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b505-9\">THE COURT: Well, I don\u2019t know. I\u2019ll have to think about it. I appreciate your bringing this to my attention. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AET\">The court made no further inquiry into the matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-10\">\u00b629 \u201cOf all the rights that an accused person has, the right to be represented by counsel is by far the most pervasive for it affects his ability to assert any other right he may have.\u201d <em>United States v. Cronic, </em>466 U.S. 648, 654, 104 S. Ct. 2039, 2044 (1984). Furthermore, a criminal defendant\u2019s right to the effective assistance of counsel includes the right to conflict-free representation. <em>State v. St. Dennis, </em>2010 MT 229, \u00b6 28, 358 Mont. 88, 244 P.3d 292 (citing U.S. Const. amend. VI; Mont. Const, art. II, \u00a7 24; <em>State v. Cook, </em>171 P.3d 1282, 1289 (Idaho App. 2007)). Indeed, the Supreme Court pointed out in <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 688, 104 S. Ct. 2052, 2065 (1984), that effective assistance of counsel includes both a duty of loyalty and a duty to avoid conflicts of interest. The Supreme Court has also pointed out that \u201c[i]t is well settled that \u2018[a] criminal defendant is entitled to counsel whose undivided loyalties lie with the client.\u2019 \u201d <em>Stoia v. United States, </em>109 F.3d 392, 395 (7th Cir. 1997) (quoting <em>United States v. Barnes, </em>909 F.2d 1059, 1065 (7th Cir. 1990); <em>United States v. Ellison, </em>798 F.2d 1102, 1106 (7th Cir. 1986)).</p>\n<p id=\"b505-11\">\u00b630 I see no reason why standby counsel should not be required to fulfill the same basic obligations for effective representation as appointed or retained counsel. In fact, why appoint standby counsel at all if they are not required to offer effective representation when called upon by the accused to do so?</p>\n<p id=\"b505-12\">\u00b631 The Washington Supreme Court considered this very issue of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>whether a conflict of interest between standby counsel and a defendant merited a presumption of prejudice justifying reversal of the defendant\u2019s conviction when the trial court was notified of the conflict but failed to inquire into its nature and extent. <em>State v. McDonald, </em>22 P.3d 791 (Wash. 2001). In that case, the court determined that even though a defendant who is afforded the right to self-representation cannot claim ineffective assistance of counsel for the obvious reason that the defendant has become his own counsel and assumes complete responsibility for his own representation, this does not mean that standby counsel has no obligations or duties to the defendant when standby counsel has been appointed by the court. The <em>McDonald </em>court stated that a defendant possesses the right to have conflict-free standby counsel \u201cbecause standby counsel must be (1) candid and forthcoming in providing technical information/advice, (2) able to fully represent the accused on a moment\u2019s notice, in the event termination of the defendant\u2019s self-representation is necessary, and (3) able to maintain attorney-client privilege.\u201d <em>McDonald, </em>22 P.3d at 794-95.</p>\n<p id=\"AZ\">\u00b632 The Washington Supreme Court upheld the appellate court\u2019s reversal of the defendant\u2019s conviction in <em>McDonald </em>holding that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b506-4\">when the trial court knows or should know of a conflict of interest between the defendant and standby counsel, <em>it must conduct an inquiry into the nature and extent of the conflict. </em>After such an inquiry, the court may remove standby counsel and then substitute or replace standby counsel, or take other appropriate action. <em>Failure to make an inquiry and take appropriate action constitutes reversible error and prejudice will be presumed.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"A4Y\"><em>McDonald, </em>22 P.3d at 795 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b506-5\">\u00b633 I agree with the Washington Supreme Court\u2019s holding in <em>McDonald </em>that when a trial court knows or should know of a conflict of interest between the defendant and standby counsel, the court must conduct an inquiry into the nature and extent of the conflict. Failure to make an inquiry and take appropriate action constitutes reversible error and prejudice should be presumed.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-6\">\u00b634 The Court states at \u00b6 13 of the Opinion that \u201cthe central issue briefed by the parties, which we deem dispositive, is whether an actual conflict existed in this case.\u201d However, since the District Court did not hold an appropriate hearing on standby counsels\u2019 assertions that a conflict did exist, we do not have enough facts, in my view, to resolve this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-7\">\u00b635 This Court has repeatedly stated that \u201c[wjhen a defendant complains about ineffective assistance of appointed counsel and requests new counsel, a district court must make an \u2018adequate initial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>inquiry as to whether defendant\u2019s allegations are \u2018seemingly substantial.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Dethman, </em>2010 MT 268, \u00b6 16, 358 Mont. 384, 245 P.3d 30 (quoting <em>State v. Happel, </em>2010 MT 200, \u00b6 14, 357 Mont. 390, 240 P.3d 1016; <em>State v. Gallagher, </em>1998 MT 70, \u00b6 15, 288 Mont. 180, 955 P.2d 1371). An \u201cadequate initial inquiry\u201d occurs when the district court \u201cconsiders the defendant\u2019s factual complaints together with counsel\u2019s specific explanations and makes some sort of critical analysis of the complaint. \u201d <em>Dethman, </em>\u00b6 16 (citing <em>Happel, </em>\u00b6 14). During such an inquiry, the district court\u2019s duty is to determine \u201cwhether a conflict is so great as to result in a total lack of communication.\u201d <em>Dethman, </em>\u00b6 16 (citing <em>State v. Hendershot, </em>2007 MT 49, \u00b6 24, 336 Mont. 164, 153 P.3d 619).</p>\n<p id=\"b507-4\">\u00b636 Furthermore, the Supreme Court noted that while, ordinarily, prejudice to the defendant must be shown with respect to deficient performance by counsel, there are certain instances where prejudice is presumed, such as \u201cwhen counsel is burdened by an actual conflict of interest.\u201d <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 692, 104 S. Ct. at 2067. In such cases, prejudice is presumed because \u201cit is difficult to measure the precise effect on the defense of representation corrupted by conflicting interests.\u201d <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 692, 104 S. Ct. at 2067.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-5\">\u00b637 Moreover, in an earlier case, the Supreme Court found the following considerations persuasive:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b507-6\">An attorney representing two defendants in a criminal matter is in the best position professionally and ethically to determine when a conflict of interest exists or will probably develop in the course of a trial. Second, defense attorneys have the obligation, upon discovering a conflict of interests, to advise the court at once of the problem. Finally, attorneys are officers of the court, and when they address the judge solemnly upon a matter before the court, their declarations are virtually made under oath.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AuL\"><em>Holloway v. Arkansas, </em>435 U.S. 475, 485-86, 98 S. Ct. 1173, 1179 (1978) (internal citations and quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b507-7\">\u00b638 The Supreme Court concluded in <em>Holloway </em>that because of the seriousness of a violation of a defendant\u2019s fundamental right to effective assistance of counsel, reversal of a defendant\u2019s conviction should be automatic in situations where counsel raised an issue of conflict of interest to the trial court. To that end, the Supreme Court stated that the right to have the assistance of counsel \u201cis too fundamental and absolute to allow courts to indulge in nice calculations as to the amount of prejudice arising from its denial.\u201d <em>Holloway, </em>435 U.S. at 488, 98 S. Ct. at 1181. Thus, if a defendant\u2019s Sixth Amendment right to counsel is infringed, prejudice is presumed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>regardless of whether it was independently shown, and reversal is automatic. <em>Holloway, </em>435 U.S. at 489, 98 S. Ct. at 1181 (citing <em>Gideon v. Wainwright, </em>372 U.S. 335, 83 S. Ct. 792 (1963); <em>Hamilton v. Alabama, </em>368 U.S. 52, 82 S. Ct. 157 (1961); <em>White v. Maryland, </em>373 U.S. 59, 83 S. Ct. 1050 (1963)).</p>\n<p id=\"b508-4\">\u00b639 One of the requirements for any counsel is that counsel must be able to maintain attorney-client privilege. That requirement should be no different for standby counsel. In the instant case, the Court states at \u00b6 16 that \u201cLongjaw questioned [Haygood] briefly and the record reveals no involvement by standby counsel regarding Haygood, nor is any such involvement asserted by Longjaw.\u201d Because the trial court did not inquire as to the conflict raised by standby counsel based on Haygood\u2019s testifying in this case, we have no way to know why standby counsel was not more involved in questioning Haygood. The possibility exists that standby counsel could not assist Longjaw with questioning Haygood because of problems with attorney-client privilege regarding standby counsel\u2019s representation of Haygood.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-5\">\u00b640 In addition, the Court asserted at \u00b6 17, that \u201c[ajlthough a potential conflict may have presented here, we conclude that the circumstances did not progress to an actual conflict wherein standby counsel were required to make a choice to the detriment of Longjaw\u2019s interests.\u201d Once again, because the trial court did not make an adequate inquiry into the <em>potential </em>conflict presented here, we have no way of knowing if an <em>actual </em>conflict existed.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-6\">\u00b641 Certain conflicts of interest are so basic that they cannot be accurately assessed after a trial, and prejudice should be presumed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A1O\">[I]n a case of joint representation of conflicting interests the evil-it bears repeating-is in what the advocate finds himself compelled to <em>refrain </em>from doing, not only at trial but also as to possible pretrial plea negotiations and in the sentencing process. It may be possible in some cases to identify from the record the prejudice resulting from an attorney\u2019s failure to undertake certain trial tasks, but even with a record of the sentencing hearing available it would be difficult to judge intelligently the impact of a conflict on the attorney\u2019s representation of a client. And to assess the impact of a conflict of interests on the attorney\u2019s options, tactics, and decisions in plea negotiations would be virtually impossible.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b508-7\"><em>St. Dennis, </em>\u00b6 59 (Nelson, J., dissenting) (citing <em>Holloway, </em>435 U.S. at 490-91, 98 S. Ct. at 1182).</p>\n<p id=\"b508-8\">\u00b642 In <em>St. Dennis, </em>this Court recognized that the OPD had established certain protocols to handle conflicts of interest between clients by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>utilizing different Regions of the OPD system to represent clients with conflicts of interest. <em>St. Dennis, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 22-24. However, as I pointed out in my dissenting opinion in <em>St. Dennis, </em>the OPD system is burdened with significant flaws. <em>St. Dennis, </em>\u00b6 75 (Nelson, J., dissenting); <em>see also Hendricks v. State, </em>2006 MT 22, \u00b6\u00b6 21-39, 331 Mont. 47, 128 P.3d 1017 (Nelson, J., dissenting). Those flaws have appeared again in this case. \u00b643 I would remand this case for a new trial on the charge of sexual intercourse without consent, and I dissent from our failure to do so.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
