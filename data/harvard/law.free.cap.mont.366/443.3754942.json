In the prior appeal, we affirmed Duncan\u2019s conviction of two counts of felony sexual assault and remanded the case for resentencing. <em>State v. Duncan, </em>2008 MT 148, 343 Mont. 220, 183 P.3d 111. The District Court for the Seventh Judicial District, Richland County, subsequently granted Duncan\u2019s petition for postconviction relief on the grounds of ineffective assistance of counsel and prosecutorial misconduct. In this interlocutory appeal, Duncan challenges the District Court\u2019s order denying his motion to dismiss the criminal charges for which the State intends to re-prosecute him.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-6\">\u00b62 The only issue on appeal is whether the District Court erred when it denied Duncan\u2019s motion to dismiss the criminal charges on double jeopardy grounds. \u201c[W]e will accept an interim appeal for the sole purpose of considering the merits of the defendant\u2019s double jeopardy claims.\u201d <em>State v. Barron, </em>2008 MT 69, \u00b6 8, 342 Mont. 100, 179 P.3d 519. We accept the appeal and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-7\">PROCEDURAL AND FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b470-8\">\u00b63 The factual background of Duncan\u2019s alleged offenses and prior conviction is set forth in this Court\u2019s previous opinion. <em>Duncan, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 8-14. Duncan was charged with sexually assaulting his stepdaughter, C.S., and her friends, V.G. and N.M., all minors. The jury convicted him of the charges involving V.G. and N.M., and acquitted him of the charges involving C.S. <em>Duncan, </em>\u00b6 14. After his conviction was affirmed on direct appeal, Duncan filed <em>pro se </em>a petition for postconviction relief. The District Court appointed counsel and received supplemental briefs. The court granted Duncan\u2019s petition for postconviction relief because it determined that his trial counsel provided ineffective assistance when he (1) \u201cfail[ed] to object to the Prosecutor\u2019s statements in closing arguments suggesting that Duncan was required to \u2018refute\u2019 the State\u2019s proof\u2019; and (2) \u201cmischaracterize[ed] the burden of proof in closing argument.\u201d The court concluded that those failures \u201cdeprived Duncan of a fair trial\u201d and violated his rights to counsel and to due process under the state and federal constitutions. Mont. Const, art. II, \u00a7\u00a7 17, 24; U.S. Const, amends. VI, XIV. The court granted Duncan a new trial and ordered that his sentence be vacated and his guilty verdict stricken from the record. The State later notified Duncan that it intended once more to prosecute him for committing the crimes of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>which the jury had found him guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-4\">\u00b64 Duncan moved to dismiss the charges against him, arguing that, under our cases applying the Supreme Court\u2019s holding in <em>Oregon v. Kennedy, </em>456 U.S. 667, 102 S. Ct. 2083 (1982), \u201cthe Double Jeopardy Clause affords protection where prosecutorial misconduct prevents an acquittal by achieving a conviction by improper means.\u201d The court denied Duncan\u2019s motion because it concluded that he \u201cfail[ed] to establish that the objective facts and circumstances of the case show the prosecutor intended to goad [him] to move for a mistrial\u201d as required by <em>Kennedy. </em>On appeal, Duncan urges this Court to conclude that his constitutional guarantee to be free from double jeopardy prohibits the State from prosecuting him for a second time.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-5\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b471-6\">\u00b65 The grant or denial of a motion to dismiss in a criminal proceeding \u201cis a question of law, which we review de novo to determine whether the district court\u2019s conclusion of law is correct.\u201d <em>State v. Otto, </em>2012 MT 199, \u00b6 7, 366 Mont. 209, 285 P.3d 583 (quoting <em>State v. Allen, </em>2009 MT 124, \u00b6 9, 350 Mont. 204, 206 P.3d 951). \u201cA double jeopardy claim presents a question of constitutional law over which we exercise plenary review.\u201d <em>State v. Brooks, </em>2010 MT 226, \u00b6 11, 358 Mont. 51, 243 P.3d 405. We consistently have held that \u201cif a district court reaches the correct result, then we will uphold the court\u2019s judgment regardless of the reasons for its decision.\u201d <em>Parini v. Missoula Co. High Sch., </em>284 Mont. 14, 21-22, 944 P.2d 199, 203 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b471-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b471-8\">\u00b66 The Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment of the United States Constitution provides: \u201c[N]or shall any person be subject for the same offense to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb.\u201d The Clause applies to the states through the Fourteenth Amendment. <em>Benton v. Maryland, </em>395 U.S. 784, 794, 89 S. Ct. 2056, 2062 (1969). Montana\u2019s Constitution establishes similar double jeopardy protections, stating: \u201cNo person shall be again put in jeopardy for the same offense previously tried in any jurisdiction.\u201d Mont. Const, art. II, \u00a7 25. \u201c[Cjentral to the objective of the prohibition against successive trials is the barrier to affording the prosecution another opportunity to supply evidence which it failed to muster in the first proceeding.\u201d <em>U.S. v. DiFrancesco, </em>449 U.S. 117, 128, 101 S. Ct. 426, 432-33 (1980) (quoting <em>Burks v. U.S., </em>437 U.S. 1, 11, 98 S. Ct. 2141, 2147 (1978)) (internal quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b471-9\">\u00b67 It is well established that \u201c[w]hen a mistrial is granted on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>defendant\u2019s motion in a criminal case ... the Double Jeopardy Clause ordinarily does not bar the State from trying him or her again on the same indictment.\u201d <em>State v. Mallak, </em>2005 MT 49, \u00b6 18, 326 Mont. 165, 109 P.3d 209. A \u201cnarrow exception to this rule\u201d occurs \u201c[o]nly where the governmental conduct in question is intended to \u2018goad\u2019 the defendant into moving for a mistrial ....\u201d <em>Mallak, </em>\u00b6 18 (quoting <em>Kennedy, </em>456 U.S. at 676, 102 S. Ct. at 2089). Although Duncan acknowledges that he did not move for a mistrial, he argues that \u201cthere should be no distinction\u201d between a defendant \u201cwho successfully requests a mistrial because of the prosecution\u2019s misconduct\u201d and defendants who are \u201cdeprived of a fair trial because of prosecutorial misconduct and attendant ineffective assistance of counsel, then successfully overturn their convictions via postconviction relief.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b472-4\">\u00b68 The State responds to Duncan\u2019s argument by asserting that, \u201c[b]ecause no mistrial was declared in Duncan\u2019s trial, the instant case does not present the scenario permitted under <em>Oregon v. Kennedy.\u201d </em>The State argues that we should not expand the <em>Kennedy </em>exception, which we adopted in <em>Mallak, </em>to convictions overturned on postconviction relief because this Court already has held that \u201ca defendant is not subjected to double jeopardy by virtue of his retrial\u201d when his judgment of conviction has been set aside at his request. <em>See State ex rel. Nelson v. Ellsworth, </em>141 Mont. 78, 81-82, 375 P.2d 316, 318 (1962). The State cites \u00a7 46-11-505(2), MCA, as additional support for its position.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-5\">\u00b69 Duncan contends in his reply brief that the State\u2019s arguments are not properly before this Court because the State did not make those same arguments to the District Court. Duncan argued to the District Court in his motion to dismiss that \u201cthere should be no distinction between a defendant who ... is deprived of a fair trial because of prosecutorial misconduct and attendant ineffective assistance of counsel, then successfully appeals his conviction on the same basis, and a defendant who successfully requests a mistrial because of the prosecutor\u2019s misconduct.\u201d He advances the identical argument on appeal. The State contended in District Court that Duncan had not satisfied the <em>Kennedy /Mallak </em>standard of proving that the prosecutor \u201cgoaded\u201d him into seeking a new trial. Duncan\u2019s appeal squarely presents the question whether the <em>Kennedy </em>standard applies when a new trial has been granted on postconviction relief rather than on a motion for mistrial. The State\u2019s reference to additional authority in responding to his argument does not pose an obstacle to our plenary review of the issue Duncan raises on appeal. <em>See State v. Montgomery, </em>2010 MT 193, \u00b6 12, 357 Mont. 348, 239 P.3d 929.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>\u00b610 Duncan\u2019s proposed exception-that a defendant\u2019s double jeopardy protections bar retrial if his conviction is reversed on postconviction relief due to prosecutorial misconduct-directly conflicts with Montana law. Section 46-11-505(2), MCA, establishes that \u201c[a] prosecution is not a bar if... the former prosecution resulted in a judgment of conviction that was held invalid in a postconviction hearing.\u201d Duncan does not challenge the constitutionality of the statute. \u201cAbsent a direct constitutional challenge to the statutes, this Court\u2019s role is simply to interpret and apply the statutes as written and consistent with legislative intent.\u201d <em>Ford v. Sentry Cas. Co., </em>2012 MT 156, \u00b6 68, 365 Mont. 405, 282 P.3d 687 (citing \u00a7\u00a7 1-2-101, -102, MCA). We hold that, under the express terms of \u00a7 46-11-502(2), MCA, the State has the option of re-prosecuting defendants like Duncan whose convictions are set aside on postconviction relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-4\">\u00b611 It is \u201cvery clear from previous holdings of this court that a reversal of a judgment of conviction upon appeal and a retrial does not constitute double jeopardy.\u201d <em>Ellsworth, </em>141 Mont. at 81, 375 P.2d at 318. We have held, for example, that \u201cafter a verdict or a judgment of conviction or acquittal, the defendant in a criminal case has been in jeopardy and may not be tried again for the same offense, <em>except in a case of a new trial which has been granted or ordered.\u201d State v. Keerl, </em>33 Mont. 501, 516, 85 P. 862, 865-66 (1906) (emphasis added). When a defendant is granted a new trial on appeal, the \u201cdefendant is not placed in a new jeopardy by the second trial, but is merely subjected to the same jeopardy that he was in on the first trial.\u201d <em>State v. Aus, </em>105 Mont. 82, 86, 69 P.2d 584, 585 (1937). That principle applies with equal force regardless of whether a defendant secures a new trial on direct appeal to this Court or on postconviction relief. Duncan presents no convincing authority to the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-5\">\u00b612 Although Duncan argues that the <em>Kennedy </em>exception should be extended to convictions that are reversed on postconviction relief due to prosecutorial misconduct, his argument directly conflicts with the Supreme Court\u2019s opinions in <em>Kennedy </em>and other cases. The <em>Kennedy </em>Court noted that it \u201chas consistently held that the <em>Double Jeopardy Clause imposes no limitation upon the power of the government to retry a defendant who has succeeded in persuading a court to set his conviction aside, </em>unless the conviction has been reversed because of the insufficiency of the evidence.\u201d <em>Kennedy, </em>456 U.S. at 677 n. 6, 102 S. Ct. at 2090 n. 6 (citing <em>DiFrancesco, </em>449 U.S. at 130-31, 101 S. Ct. at 433-34) (emphasis added). Duncan\u2019s conviction was not reversed because of insufficient evidence. His double jeopardy argument is unpersuasive because \u201c[t]o require a criminal defendant to stand trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>again after he has successfully invoked a statutory right of appeal to upset his first conviction is not an act of governmental oppression of the sort against which the Double Jeopardy Clause was intended to protect.\u201d <em>DiFrancesco, </em>449 U.S. at 131, 101 S. Ct. at 434 (quoting <em>U.S. v. Scott, </em>437 U.S. 82, 91, 98 S. Ct. 2187, 2194 (1978)).</p>\n<p id=\"b474-4\">\u00b613  The District Court held, and the State does not dispute, that Duncan\u2019s constitutional right to a fair trial was violated by prosecutorial misconduct and by ineffective assistance of counsel. While a defendant has a constitutional right to a fair trial, society maintains an interest in the enforcement of its criminal codes and \u201c[i]t would be a high price indeed for society to pay\u201d if a defendant were granted immunity from re-prosecution because his conviction was overturned on postconviction relief. <em>DiFrancesco, </em>449 U.S. at 131, 101 S. Ct. at 434 (quoting <em>U.S. v. Tateo, </em>377 U.S. 463, 466, 84 S. Ct. 1587, 1589 (1964)). Any constitutional injury that Duncan suffered at his first trial can be cured by a new trial, which the District Court has granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-5\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b474-6\">\u00b614  We decline to adopt Duncan\u2019s suggested expansion of our double jeopardy doctrine because it conflicts with \u00a7 46-11-505, MCA-the constitutionality of which Duncan does not challenge-and with our prior opinions and the Supreme Court\u2019s opinion in <em>Kennedy. </em>We hold that Duncan\u2019s constitutional right to be free from double jeopardy does not prohibit the State from re-prosecuting him after his conviction was overturned by the postconviction court\u2019s determination of prosecutorial misconduct and ineffective assistance of counsel. The District Court\u2019s December 9, 2011 order denying Duncan\u2019s motion to dismiss on double jeopardy grounds is affirmed and the case is remanded for further proceedings.</p>\n<judges id=\"b474-7\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES MORRIS and RICE concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b474-8\">JUSTICE NELSON dissents.</judges>\n<p id=\"b474-9\">\u00b615 I agree that Duncan did not challenge the constitutionality of \u00a7 46-11-505(2), MCA, and therefore waived that argument. Opinion, \u00b6 10. Thus, I leave that issue to be decided in a future case where the argument is properly raised.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-10\">\u00b616 That said, I cannot join the Court\u2019s analysis at \u00b6\u00b6 12-14. In my view, the prosecutor did goad Duncan by undermining Duncan\u2019s presumption of innocence with his comments. Therefore, I believe that the prosecutor committed misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>\u00b617 While society might pay a \u201chigh price\u201d if a defendant\u2019s conviction is overturned on post conviction relief, Opinion, \u00b6 13, society pays even more dearly when the prosecutor-an officer of the court who should be seeking justice, and not merely a conviction<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>-refuses to scrupulously respect the accused\u2019s constitutional right to the presumption of innocence and to a fair trial. In those cases, not only is the accused victimized, but so also are society and the criminal justice system. \u00b618 I dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b475-4\"> See <em>State ex rel.
