We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-5\">\u00b62 Young raises two issues on appeal which we have consolidated into the following issue: Whether the District Court erred in determining that Idaho\u2019s DUI statute is similar enough to Montana\u2019s DUI statute to allow the enhancement of a Montana DUI to a felony.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-6\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b554-7\">\u00b63 On August 26,2010, the State charged Young with DUI, Criminal Possession of Dangerous Drugs, and Criminal Possession of Drug Paraphernalia. While the two drug counts were charged as misdemeanors, the DUI count was charged as a felony because the State maintained that Young had three prior DUI convictions. Young had been convicted of DUI in Idaho in 1991 and 1997, and in Montana in 2000.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-8\">\u00b64 On February 4,2011, Young filed a Motion to Dismiss Felony DUI Charge arguing that his two Idaho DUI convictions should not be counted because the Idaho DUI statute is not similar to Montana\u2019s DUI statute. Young claimed that Montana\u2019s statute requires a greater standard of culpability to be found guilty of a DUI than Idaho\u2019s statute requires. The District Court disagreed and denied Young\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-9\">\u00b65 In its order denying Young\u2019s motion to dismiss, the District Court determined that both the Montana and Idaho DUI statutes use the term \u201cbe in actual physical control\u201d of a vehicle, and both statutes target driving while impaired by either alcohol or drugs. The court also determined that \u201c[w]ithout question the general purpose of each statute is to prohibit people from driving when they are unable to do so safely.\u201d Thus, the court concluded that while the statutes are not precisely identical, they are similar because they have characteristics in common and are alike in substance.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-10\">\u00b66 Thereafter, the State and Young entered into a plea agreement in which Young agreed to plead guilty to felony DUI, and the State agreed to dismiss the misdemeanor charges of Criminal Possession of Dangerous Drugs and Criminal Possession of Drug Paraphernalia. In addition, Young reserved the right to appeal the District Court\u2019s denial of his motion to dismiss the felony DUI charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-11\">\u00b67 Pursuant to the plea agreement, Young pled guilty to felony DUI on June 2, 2011. The District Court sentenced Young to the Montana Department of Corrections WATCh program for a period of 13 months followed by a five-year suspended sentence. The District Court also <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>dismissed the two misdemeanor drug charges, and stayed the imposition of Young\u2019s sentence pending the outcome of this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-4\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b555-5\">\u00b68 We review a district court\u2019s conclusions of law regarding the application of a statute to determine whether that court\u2019s interpretation of the law is correct. <em>State v. Peplow, </em>2001 MT 253, \u00b6 17, 307 Mont. 172, 36 P.3d 922 (citing <em>State v. Henning, </em>258 Mont. 488, 490-91, 853 P.2d 1223, 1225 (1993)).</p>\n<p id=\"b555-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b555-7\">\u00b69 <em>Whether the District Court erred in determining that Idaho\u2019s DUI statute is similar enough to Montana\u2019s DUI statute to allow the enhancement of a Montana DUI to a felony.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b555-8\">\u00b610 Section 61-8-734(l)(a), MCA, provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b555-9\">For the purpose of determining the number of convictions for prior offenses referred to in 61-8-465, 61-8-714, 61-8-722, or 61-8-731, \u201cconviction\u201d means a final conviction ... in this state [or a] conviction for a violation of a <em>similar </em>statute or regulation in another state .... [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b555-10\">Thus, Young argues that in order to use his Idaho DUI convictions to enhance his current Montana DUI to a felony, Idaho\u2019s DUI statute must be \u201csimilar\u201d to Montana\u2019s DUI statute. Young maintains that the statutes are not similar because Montana\u2019s DUI statute requires a higher standard of culpability than Idaho\u2019s DUI statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-11\">\u00b611 The State argues that the Idaho and Montana DUI statutes are similar because both statutes prohibit a person from driving while under the influence of alcohol or drugs. The State also argues that although the wording of the statutes is slightly different, their definitions of the phrase \u201cunder the influence\u201d are essentially the same since both definitions require the consumption of alcohol or drugs to affect a person\u2019s ability to drive a motor vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-12\">\u00b612 Montana\u2019s DUI statute provides that \u201c[i]t is unlawful and punishable ... for a person who is <em>under the influence of </em>alcohol \u201cto drive or be in actual physical control of a vehicle upon the ways of this state open to the public.\u201d Section 61-8-401(1), MCA (emphasis added). Idaho\u2019s DUI statute, on the other hand, provided in 1991 and 1997<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>when Young received his DUIs in that state:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b556-4\">It is unlawful for any person who is <em>under the influence </em>of alcohol, drugs or any other intoxicating substances ... to drive or be in actual physical control of a motor vehicle within this state, whether upon a highway, street or bridge, or upon public or private property open to the public.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b556-5\">Idaho Code \u00a7 18-8004(l)(a) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b556-6\">\u00b613 Thus, the Montana and Idaho DUI statutes are nearly identical. The difference, according to Young, is in how each state defines the phrase \u201cunder the influence.\u201d In Montana, \u201c \u2018[u]nder the influence\u2019 means that as a result of taking into the body alcohol, drugs, or any combination of alcohol or drugs, a person\u2019s ability to safely operate a vehicle has been diminished.\u201d Section 61-8-401(3)(a), MCA. Diminished in this context means \u201creduced or to a lesser degree.\u201d <em>State v. Polaski, </em>2005 MT 13, \u00b6 22, 325 Mont. 351, 106 P.3d 538 (quoting Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary 634 (1971)). The Idaho statutes do not define the phrase \u201cunder the influence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b556-7\">\u00b614 Young argues that the Montana and Idaho DUI statutes are not similar because the Idaho Court of Appeals in <em>State v. Schmoll, </em>172 P.3d 555, 556 (Idaho Ct. App. 2007), defined \u201cunder the influence\u201d as \u201cimpairment of driving ability to the slightest degree,\u201d and this Court in <em>State v. McNally, </em>2002 MT 160, \u00b6 22, 310 Mont. 396, 50 P.3d 1080, stated that in Montana, \u201ca person simply may not be convicted for DUI if his or her ability is impaired \u2018to the slightest degree.\u2019 \u201d As support for his argument, Young quotes the following language from <em>Schmoll </em>in his brief on appeal:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b556-8\">Proving that a person is under the influence absent a BAC test requires a greater degree of impairment in Montana than in Idaho, since in Idaho, the ability to drive need only be impaired \u201cto the slightest degree,\u201d while in Montana, the ability to drive \u201csafely\u201d is the quality that must be diminished. Impairment to the slightest degree is an equal or lesser standard than the diminished ability to drive safely test used by Montana; thus Montana\u2019s higher standard surpasses the elements required for a violation in Idaho.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b556-9\"><em>Schmoll, </em>172 P.3d at 559.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-10\">\u00b615 However, contrary to Young\u2019s contentions, the court in <em>Schmoll </em>went on to explain that the Montana and Idaho statutes <em>are </em>similar as they \u201cframe their prohibitions using the same language, requiring substantially conforming elements to be met to sustain a violation.\u201d <em>Schmoll, </em>172 P.3d at 559. The court concluded by stating that \u201c[t]he prohibited act of driving under the influence in Montana substantially <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>conforms to the prohibited act of driving under the influence in Idaho.\u201d <em>Schmoll, </em>172 P.3d at 560.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-4\">\u00b616 Furthermore, as the District Court pointed out in its order denying Young\u2019s motion to dismiss, <em>McNally </em>addressed a situation in which the convictions from the other jurisdiction stemmed from a statute that had no counterpart in Montana law. In <em>McNally, </em>the State requested that McNally be sentenced for felony DUI based in part on four previous convictions in Colorado. <em>McNally, </em>\u00b6 3. At that time, Colorado prohibited at least three different alcohol driving offenses: DUI, DUI per se (driving with a blood alcohol content of 0.10 or more), and Driving While Ability Impaired (DWAI). Montana had essentially comparable statutes for DUI and DUI per se, but there was no Montana counterpart for DWAI, the offenses for which McNally had been convicted. <em>McNally, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 8-10. By contrast, in the instant case, Young\u2019s convictions in Idaho resulted from a DUI statute with language nearly identical to Montana\u2019s DUI statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-5\">\u00b617 In addition, the day after the Idaho Court of Appeals handed down its decision in <em>Schmoll, </em>the Supreme Court of Idaho (Idaho\u2019s highest court) held that \u201c[i]n order to be \u2018under the influence,\u2019 a person need only have consumed sufficient alcohol and drugs or other intoxicating substances \u2018to such extent as to influence or affect his driving of the motor vehicle.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Oliver, </em>170 P.3d 387, 389 (Idaho 2007) (citing <em>State v. Glanzman, </em>202 P.2d 407, 408 (Idaho 1949); <em>State v. Gleason, </em>844 P.2d 691 (Idaho 1992)).</p>\n<p id=\"b557-6\">\u00b618  Therefore, the Idaho Supreme Court\u2019s definition of \u201cunder the influence\u201d is essentially the same as Montana\u2019s definition with its \u201cdiminished\u201d standard. Both require more than just drinking and driving; they require the consumption of alcohol or drugs to affect a person\u2019s ability to drive. Consequently, we conclude that the consumption of sufficient alcohol or drugs to influence or affect a person\u2019s driving is not a lesser standard than if, as a result of consuming alcohol or drugs, a person\u2019s ability to safely operate a motor vehicle has been diminished.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-7\">\u00b619  Accordingly, we hold that the District Court did not err in determining that Idaho\u2019s DUI statute is similar enough to Montana\u2019s DUI statute to allow the enhancement of a Montana DUI to a felony. \u00b620 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b557-8\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES WHEAT, BAKER and RICE concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b555-13\"> The 1991 and 1997 Idaho DUI statutes are identical except that the 1991 Idaho DUI statute made it a crime for an individual to drive with an alcohol concentration of 0.10 or more, while the 1997 Idaho DUI statute made it a crime for an individual to drive with an alcohol concentration of 0.08 or more.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
