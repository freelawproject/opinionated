We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-6\">\u00b62 The sole issue on appeal is whether the District Court erred by denying Sanchez\u2019s postconviction petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-7\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b159-8\">\u00b63 Sanchez was convicted of the deliberate homicide of his ex-girlfriend, Aleasha Chenowith (Aleasha). The events surrounding Aleasha\u2019s death and Sanchez\u2019s trial and conviction are detailed in our prior opinion, <em>State v. Sanchez, </em>2008 MT 27, 341 Mont. 240, 177 P.3d 444. We recount those facts pertinent to this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-9\">\u00b64 On July 19, 2004, Sanchez shot and killed Aleasha outside her home. Later that evening, Sanchez turned himself in and admitted to shooting Aleasha. The State charged Sanchez with deliberate homicide. Before trial commenced in June 2005, Sanchez moved to exclude a note, written by Aleasha, which the State proposed as a trial exhibit. The note read:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b159-10\">To whom it concerns:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b159-11\">On July 8, 04 around 10:30 p [sic] Raul Sanchez Cardines told me if I ever was cought [sic] with another man while I was dating him, that he would kill me. Raul told me he had friends in Mexico that had medicine that would kill me and our doctors wouldn\u2019t know what it was till it was to [sic] late and I would be dead.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b159-12\">So if I unexspetly [sic] become sick and on the edge of death, and perhaps I die no [sic] you will have some answers.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b159-13\">Aleasha Chenowith (written and printed signature)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b159-14\"><em>Sanchez, </em>\u00b6 8. Sanchez argued the note should be excluded because it constituted multiple hearsay evidence and violated his Sixth Amendment right to confrontation. The District Court denied Sanchez\u2019s motion and ruled that Aleasha\u2019s note and the statements within the note were admissible under hearsay exceptions. The court did not address Sanchez\u2019s Confrontation Clause argument. <em>Sanchez, </em>\u00b6 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-15\">\u00b65 Sanchez testified at trial and presented a defense based on the existence of mitigating circumstances for the killing. <em>Sanchez, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 52, 60. Although the jury was instructed on mitigated deliberate homicide, Sanchez was convicted of deliberate homicide and sentenced to life without parole. <em>Sanchez, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 13-14. Sanchez appealed, and various <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>Appellate Defenders were assigned to represent him. One Appellate Defender was David Avery (Avery), who filed Sanchez\u2019s reply brief and presented oral argument to this Court. Then-Chief Appellate Defender James Wheelis (Wheelis) maintained oversight of Sanchez\u2019s case after Avery\u2019s departure from the Office of the State Public Defender.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-4\">\u00b66 On appeal, this Court affirmed Sanchez\u2019s conviction in an opinion dated January 31, 2008. <em>Sanchez, </em>\u00b6 1. We concluded that, while Aleasha\u2019s note constituted hearsay not subject to any exceptions, the note\u2019s admission was harmless error because the State presented other admissible evidence that proved the same facts. <em>Sanchez, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 27-29. Regarding Sanchez\u2019s Sixth Amendment confrontation right, we held that Aleasha\u2019s note was testimonial hearsay subject to the Confrontation Clause. <em>See Crawford v. Washington, </em>541 U.S. 36, 124 S. Ct. 1354 (2004); <em>Davis v. Washington, </em>547 U.S. 813, 126 S. Ct. 2266 (2006); <em>State v. Mizenko, </em>2006 MT 11, 330 Mont. 299, 127 P.3d 458. Generally, the Confrontation Clause prohibits introduction of testimonial hearsay evidence against a defendant in a criminal trial unless the witness is unavailable and the defendant had a prior opportunity to cross-examine the witness. <em>See Crawford, </em>541 U.S. at 68, 124 S. Ct. at 1374. However, this Court noted a \u201cforfeiture by wrongdoing\u201d exception to the Confrontation Clause. <em>Sanchez, </em>\u00b6 39 (quoting <em>Davis, </em>547 U.S. at 833, 126 S. Ct. at 2280 (\u201c \u2018one who obtains the absence of a witness by wrongdoing forfeits the constitutional right to confrontation\u2019 \u201d)). Because we had not considered the forfeiture doctrine since <em>Crawford </em>was decided, we discussed how the doctrine had been applied in several cases, including <em>U.S. v. Garcia-Meza, </em>403 F.3d 364 (6th Cir. 2005) and <em>California v. Giles, </em>152 P.3d 433 (Cal. 2007), <em>vacated, Giles v. California, </em>554 U.S. 353, 128 S. Ct. 2678 (2008). <em>Sanchez, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 40-44. We noted that <em>Davis\u2019 </em>application of the forfeiture doctrine had generally been interpreted by courts to require a defendant\u2019s intent to silence a witness by wrongdoing prior to application of the doctrine, <em>e.g. Colorado v. Moreno, </em>160 P.3d 242 (Colo. 2007), placing doubt on Garcia-Meza\u2019s reasoning that the doctrine was <em>not </em>limited to situations where the defendant committed wrongdoing with the intent to prevent the witness from testifying. <em>Sanchez, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 41-43. However, we indicated that other jurisdictions concurred with Garcia-Meza\u2019s holding that, in homicide cases, the doctrine\u2019s applicability does not depend on the defendant\u2019s specific intent to silence a witness. <em>Sanchez, </em>\u00b6 43. We discussed the California Supreme Court\u2019s holding in <em>Giles </em>that, in a murder case, an \u201c \u2018intent-to-silence\u2019 \u201d requirement was not a prerequisite to the application of the doctrine. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number><em>Sanchez, </em>\u00b6 43 (citing <em>Giles, </em>152 P.3d at 443).</p>\n<p id=\"b161-4\">\u00b67 We ultimately held that \u201c[t]o the extent that a deliberate criminal act results in the victim\u2019s death, we agree that the forfeiture by wrongdoing doctrine does not hinge on whether the defendant specifically intended to silence a witness,\u201d and reiterated that our holding was narrow-the forfeiture doctrine applied \u201cwhen a defendant admittedly and deliberately kills another person, thus procuring the person\u2019s unavailability as a witness.\u201d <em>Sanchez, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 46-47. We concluded that Sanchez had forfeited his Sixth Amendment right to confront Aleasha when he killed her. <em>Sanchez, </em>\u00b6 47. We \u201cagree[d] with the <em>Giles </em>court that a defendant whose intentional criminal act results in a victim-declarant\u2019s death benefits from the defendant\u2019s wrongdoing if the defendant can use the death to exclude the victim-declarant\u2019s otherwise admissible testimony, regardless of whether the defendant specifically intended to silence the victim-declarant.\u201d <em>Sanchez, </em>\u00b6 46 (citing <em>Giles, </em>152 P.3d at 443). However, we stated we did \u201cnot adopt <em>Giles,\u201d </em>and that our holding was qualified. <em>Sanchez, </em>\u00b6 47 n. 3. We noted the U.S. Supreme Court had granted certiorari for that case on January 11, 2008. <em>Sanchez, </em>\u00b6 43.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-5\">\u00b68 Sanchez did not file a petition for rehearing and did not, through the Office of the Appellate Defender, file a petition for writ of certiorari in the U.S. Supreme Court. The District Court found that Sanchez\u2019s opportunity to file a petition with the U.S. Supreme Court expired on April 30, 2008, 90 days after judgment was entered in this Court. <em>See </em>U.S. S. Ct. R. 13(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b161-6\">\u00b69 The U.S. Supreme Court decided <em>Giles </em>on June 25,2008 and held that the forfeiture by wrongdoing exception to a defendant\u2019s Sixth Amendment confrontation right \u201capplie[s] only when the defendant engaged in conduct <em>designed </em>to prevent the witness from testifying.\u201d <em>Giles, </em>554 U.S. at 359, 128 S. Ct. at 2683 (emphasis in original). The Court vacated the judgment of the California Supreme Court and remanded for further proceedings. <em>Giles, </em>554 U.S. at 377, 128 S. Ct. at 2693.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-7\">\u00b6 10 In July 2009, Sanchez filed an amended petition for postconviction relief, alleging ineffective assistance of appellate counsel (IAAC) against Wheelis for failing to file a petition for writ of certiorari to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>U.S. Supreme Court on his behalf.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> After a hearing in which Wheelis and Avery testified, the District Court denied Sanchez\u2019s petition. The court first ruled that <em>Giles </em>was a new constitutional rule that did not apply retroactively to Sanchez because his conviction \u201cbecame final long before\u201d <em>Giles </em>was decided by the U.S. Supreme Court. Regarding his IAAC claim against Wheelis, the court ruled that Sanchez failed to state a claim for relief because there is no federal, and likely no state, right to counsel for discretionary appeals. Even if Sanchez had established a right to counsel, the District Court determined that Wheelis\u2019 performance was not deficient, and Sanchez was not prejudiced. Finally, notwithstanding the prior determinations, the court concluded that the introduction of the note was harmless because there was substantial other evidence proving Sanchez was guilty of deliberate homicide.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-4\">\u00b611 Sanchez asks this Court to reverse the District Court\u2019s order denying his postconviction petition, or remand the case for a hearing to determine if Sanchez acted with intent to silence Aleasha.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-5\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b162-6\">\u00b612 \u201cWe review a district court\u2019s denial of a petition for postconviction relief to determine whether the court\u2019s findings of fact are clearly erroneous and whether its conclusions of law are correct.\u201d <em>Heddings v. State, </em>2011 MT 228, \u00b6 12, 362 Mont. 90, 265 P.3d 600 (citations omitted). Ineffective assistance of counsel claims are mixed questions of law and fact, which are reviewed de novo. <em>Miller v. State, </em>2012 MT 131, \u00b6 9, 365 Mont. 264, 280 P.3d 272 (citing <em>Whitlow v. State, </em>2008 MT 140, \u00b6 9, 343 Mont. 90, 183 P.3d 861).</p>\n<p id=\"b162-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b162-8\">\n<em>\u00b613 Did the District Court err by denying Sanchez\u2019s postconviction petition?</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b162-9\">\u00b614 Sanchez argues that the District Court erred when it denied his claim challenging Wheelis\u2019 failure to file a petition for certiorari with the U.S. Supreme Court. He contends that Wheelis\u2019 failure involves two Sixth Amendment violations: a violation of his right to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>confrontation under <em>Giles, </em>and a violation of his right to effective assistance of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-4\">\u00b615 The State argues that the District Court properly concluded, relying on <em>Ponce v. Felker, </em>606 F.3d 596 (9th Cir. 2010), that <em>Giles </em>established a new rule which does not apply retroactively to cases that became final before it was decided. The State notes that Sanchez does not challenge the District Court\u2019s determination that his conviction became final long before the <em>Giles </em>decision was issued, <em>see Gratzer v. Mahoney, </em>2006 MT 282, \u00b6 10, 334 Mont. 297, 150 P.3d 343, and therefore <em>Giles </em>is not applicable to Sanchez\u2019s Confrontation Clause claim. The State also argues that Sanchez\u2019s IAAC claim fails because he had no constitutional right to counsel for purposes of a petition for certiorari, and he cannot establish deficient performance or prejudice under the <em>Strickland </em>standard for ineffective assistance of counsel claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-5\">\u00b6 16 We need not address the merits of Sanchez\u2019s Confrontation Clause claim. In his reply brief, Sanchez \u201cconcedes <em>Giles </em>is not retro\u00e1ctive\u201d and instead frames his Confrontation Clause argument in the context of his IAAC claim. He states: \u201cIt is precisely because <em>Giles </em>is not retroactive that Sanchez asserts a claim of ineffective assistance of appellate counsel. Were <em>Giles </em>retroactive, there would be no need to argue appellate counsel was ineffective.... Thus, the issue is not whether <em>Giles </em>is retroactive; the issue is whether Sanchez\u2019s <em>Sixth Amendment </em>right to effective assistance of counsel was violated when Mr. Wheelis failed to file a petition for certiorari.\u201d (Emphases in original.) Therefore, we move to Sanchez\u2019s ineffective assistance of counsel argument.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b163-6\">\u00b617 Sanchez concedes that there is no federal constitutional right to counsel on discretionary appeals. <em>See Coleman v. Thompson, </em>501 U.S. 722, 752, 111 S. Ct. 2546, 2566 (1991) (citations omitted) (\u201cThere is no constitutional right to an attorney in state post-conviction proceedings.\u201d); <em>Pennsylvania v. Finley, </em>481 U.S. 551, 555, 107 S. Ct. 1990, 1993 (1987) (citations omitted) (\u201cWe have never held that prisoners have a constitutional right to counsel when mounting collateral attacks upon their convictions, ... and we decline to so hold today. Our cases establish that the right to appointed counsel extends to the first appeal of right, and no further. Thus, we have rejected <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>suggestions that we establish a right to counsel on discretionary appeals.\u201d). Thus, Sanchez offers that, while he may not be \u201centitled to counsel,\u201d he is \u201ccertainly entitled to effective counsel once counsel has undertaken the task to represent\u201d him.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-4\">\u00b618  Federal law is not supportive of Sanchez\u2019s argument. Because there is no constitutional right to an attorney in state postconviction proceedings, \u201ca petitioner cannot claim constitutionally ineffective assistance of counsel in such proceedings. See <em>Wainwright v. Torna, </em>455 U.S. 586, [102 S. Ct. 1300] (1982) (where there is no constitutional right to counsel there can be no deprivation of effective assistance).\u201d <em>Coleman, </em>501 U.S. at 752, 111 S. Ct. at 2566.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Rule 10 of the United States Supreme Court Rules provides, \u201c[r]eview on a writ of certiorari is not a matter of right, but of judicial discretion.\u201d U.S. S. Ct. R. 10. Consequently, Sanchez has no federal constitutional right to have his case heard by the Supreme Court via a petition for certiorari, and he cannot claim ineffective assistance for that failure. <em>See Wainwright, </em>455 U.S. at 587-88, 102 S. Ct. at 1301 (footnotes omitted) (\u201cIn <em>Ross v. Moffitt, </em>417 U.S. 600, [94 S. Ct. 2437] (1974), this Court held that a criminal defendant does not have a constitutional right to counsel to pursue discretionary state appeals or applications for review in this Court. . . . Since respondent had no constitutional right to counsel, he could not be deprived of the effective assistance of counsel by his retained counsel\u2019s failure to file the application timely.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b164-5\">\u00b619 This Court has not specifically stated whether there is a state constitutional right to counsel on discretionary proceedings, with an attendant duty of effective assistance of counsel, under state law. However, we need not take up that question. As discussed below, because Sanchez cannot prevail on his IAAC claim, we need not decide this constitutional question. <em>See Kulstad v. Maniaci, </em>2010 MT 248, \u00b6 49, 358 Mont. 230, 244 P.3d 722 (quoting <em>Wolfe v. State, Dept. of Labor &amp; Ind., </em>255 Mont. 336, 339, 843 P.2d 338, 340 (1992)) (\u2018\u201cCourts should avoid constitutional questions whenever possible.\u2019\u201d); <em>State v. Peters, </em>2011 MT 274, \u00b6 33, 362 Mont. 389, 264 P.3d 1124.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>\u00b620 This Court reviews ineffective assistance of appellate counsel claims like those of trial counsel. <em>Rogers v. State, </em>2011 MT 105, \u00b6 37, 360 Mont. 334, 253 P.3d 889. We analyze ineffective assistance of counsel claims by using the two-part test in <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 104 S. Ct. 2052 (1984). <em>Miller, </em>\u00b6 13 (citing <em>Whitlow, </em>\u00b6 10). \u201cUnder this test, the defendant must demonstrate (1) that counsel\u2019s performance was deficient, and (2) that counsel\u2019s deficient performance prejudiced the defendant.\u201d <em>St. Germain v. State, </em>2012 MT 86, \u00b6 8, 364 Mont. 494, 276 P.3d 886 (citation omitted). A defendant must satisfy both prongs of the test, and if an insufficient showing is made on one prong, we do not need to address the other prong. <em>Baca v. State, </em>2008 MT 371, \u00b6 16, 346 Mont. 474, 197 P.3d 948 (citing <em>Whitlow, </em>\u00b6 11).</p>\n<p id=\"b165-4\">\u00b621  We can dispose of Sanchez\u2019s argument on the prejudice prong, although Sanchez\u2019s arguments are overlapping and his deficiency prong argument would necessarily fail as well. Sanchez argues he suffered prejudice by the loss of certiorari being granted in his case and the opportunity of having this Court\u2019s prior opinion vacated and his case remanded for further proceedings. To satisfy the prejudice prong, Sanchez acknowledges that \u201c[he] must demonstrate that there is a reasonable probability that the United States Supreme Court would have granted his cert, petition.\u201d We conclude that Sanchez cannot demonstrate prejudice because he has not shown there is a reasonable probability that the U.S. Supreme Court would have granted certiorari in his case.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-5\">\u00b622 Under the prejudice prong of the <em>Strickland </em>test, we focus on whether counsel\u2019s deficient performance causes an unreliable trial result or creates fundamentally unfair proceedings. <em>St. Germain, </em>\u00b6 11. \u201cTo establish prejudice, the defendant must show that, but for counsel\u2019s errors, a reasonable probability exists that the result of the proceeding would have been different. A reasonable probability is a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome of the proceedings.\u201d <em>St. Germain, </em>\u00b6 11 (internal citation omitted). \u201cIn the context of a claim against appellate counsel, we have stated the standard as \u2018whether there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors, the petitioner would have prevailed on appeal.\u2019\u201d <em>Miller, </em>\u00b6 13 <em>(quoting DuBray v. State, </em>2008 MT 121, \u00b6 31, 342 Mont. 520, 182 P.3d 753).</p>\n<p id=\"b165-6\">\u00b623 Because of the very slim odds that the U.S. Supreme Court would have granted Sanchez\u2019s petition, Sanchez has not demonstrated there is a reasonable probability that but for Wheelis\u2019 error, the result of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>proceedings would have been different. <em>See Pena v. U.S., </em>2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 9308 at * 40 (S.D.N.Y. May 18, 2005), <em>aff'd, </em>529 F.3d 129 (2d Cir. 2008) (\u201cGiven the extremely low odds that a certiorari petition would have been granted, Pena has not shown a reasonable probability that but for counsel\u2019s alleged error, the result of the proceedings would have been different. Pena\u2019s ineffective assistance of appellate counsel claim is denied.\u201d). In 2008, there were 7,738 cases filed in the United States Supreme Court, 83 of which were disposed of in 74 signed opinions. Thus, roughly 1% of cases were granted. In 2009,8,159 cases were filed, of which 77 were disposed of in 73 signed opinions-0.9% were granted. In 2010,7,857 cases were filed, of which 83 were decided in 75 signed opinions. Again, about 1% of cases were granted.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>See also U.S. v. Mikell, </em>2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 2256 at ** 7, 16 (E.D. Mich. Jan. 12, <em>2010), cert. denied, </em>130 S.

Beyond statistics, the U.S. Supreme Court has also made clear that its review \u201cis discretionary and depends on numerous factors other than the perceived correctness of the judgment we are asked to review.\u201d <em>Ross, </em>417 U.S. at 616-17, 94 S.

Here, Sanchez cannot meet this heavy burden. First, the District Court determined that Avery\u2019s testimony lacked credibility, concluding: \u201cMr. Avery\u2019s opinions do not stand as evidence of what the United States Supreme Court would have done. The documentary evidence of summary reversal Sanchez presented at the hearing no more proves what the United States Supreme Court would have done than Mr. Avery\u2019s bare, unsupported opinions. Significantly, contrary to his own professed certitude, Mr. Avery allowed summary disposition by the United States Supreme Court would have been that Court\u2019s option.\u201d (Citations omitted.) \u201cThe district court determines the credibility of the witnesses and the weight assigned to their respective testimony.\u201d <em>In re Parenting of </em>N.S., 2011 MT 98, \u00b6 25, 360 Mont. 288, 253 P.3d 863 (citations omitted). Further, Sanchez can cite to no governing authority for his assertions about summary reversal, offering only that \u201cit cannot be doubted that the practice of summary reversal is prevalent at the High Court\u201d and that \u201cthere is little doubt that reversal (summary or otherwise) was the inevitable result\u201d if Wheelis had not failed to file the petition. He cites to a website indicating that there have been seven summary reversals this term. Even if true, it still does not demonstrate by a preponderance of evidence that he would have obtained relief and thus suffered actual prejudice. <em>See Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 693, 104 S. Ct. at 2067 (emphases added) (\u201c[Ajctual ineffectiveness claims alleging a deficiency in attorney performance are subject to a general requirement that the defendant <em>affirmatively prove prejudice.... </em>Even if a defendant shows that particular errors of counsel were unreasonable, therefore, the defendant must show that they <em>actually had an adverse effect </em>on the defense.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b168-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>\u00b626 Even if we were to assume, <em>arguendo, </em>that Sanchez had carried his burden to prove Wheelis was ineffective, the District Court\u2019s determination that the note\u2019s introduction was harmless has substantial support. The District Court found that the contested note was \u201cwholly unnecessary to support [the State\u2019s] burden at trial of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that [Sanchez] had committed the offense of Deliberate Homicide. Overwhelming other evidence at trial included that on the morning of the homicide, [Sanchez] took his children to a couple\u2019s home who had cared for them to assure their safety, followed by [Sanchez] going to a sporting goods store in Plains where he purchased ammunition for the handgun he had brought with him, that he loaded the weapon and then drove to the victim\u2019s house where [Sanchez] shot and killed her in the presence of witnesses.\u201d Sanchez argues in a conclusory fashion that the note \u201csignificantly boosted the State\u2019s case that there were not mitigating circumstances\u201d and \u201cseverely undercut Sanchez\u2019s attempt to present an argument that there were mitigating circumstances present at the time he actually killed\u201d Aleasha. However, \u201c \u2018[a] petitioner claiming ineffective assistance of counsel must ground his or her proof on facts within the record and not on conclusory allegations.\u2019 \u201d <em>Baca, </em>\u00b6 16 (citation omitted). The record facts here do not support Sanchez\u2019s broad allegations. Indeed, we have previously concluded that the admission of Aleasha\u2019s note was harmless because \u201cno reasonable possibility exists that the statement in the note contributed to Sanchez\u2019s conviction.\u201d <em>Sanchez, </em>\u00b6 29 (noting the cumulative evidence of Sanchez\u2019s testimony of the day he killed Aleasha, as well as Sanchez\u2019s statement to a coworker about getting out his gun and shooting Aleasha). Given the nature of this case and other evidence of Sanchez\u2019s guilt, we cannot conclude that the note\u2019s admission had an impact on the outcome.</p>\n<p id=\"AiA\">\u00b627 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b168-4\">JUSTICES WHEAT, BAKER, MORRIS and DISTRICT JUDGE BROWN, sitting for CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b168-5\">JUSTICE COTTER dissents.</judges>\n<p id=\"b168-6\">\u00b628 I dissent from the Court\u2019s Opinion. I would conclude that the District Court erred in denying Sanchez\u2019s petition for postconviction relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-7\">\u00b629 I agree with the Court\u2019s conclusion at \u00b6 16 that the issue before us is whether Sanchez\u2019s right to effective assistance of counsel was violated when Wheelis failed to file a petition for certiorari. Unlike the Court, I would answer this question in the affirmative.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-8\">\u00b630 The Court accurately observes that there is no federal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>constitutional right to counsel on discretionary appeals (Opinion, \u00b6 17), nor has this Court declared the existence of such a right. In my judgment, there is no need to declare a constitutional right to counsel for collateral proceedings in order to resolve the specific case before us. \u00b631 It strikes me as both circular and unnecessary to explore whether Sanchez had the <em>right </em>to counsel for purposes of seeking certiorari, as a predicate to consideration of his IAAC claims. The fact is Sanchez did have counsel. As the District Court found in its order denying postconviction relief, Wheelis determined after our 2008 Opinion in <em>Sanchez </em>was issued that a petition for certiorari should be filed. He testified that the operating rules of the Office of the Appellate Defender specifically permitted the filing of certiorari petitions at the discretion of the Appellate Defender. The court further found that while Wheelis might normally have required a client to pursue such a petition pro se, he concluded that given Sanchez\u2019s inability to speak or understand English, it would be \u201cvery improper\u201d to allow Sanchez to proceed without counsel. Wheelis therefore elected to pursue a petition for certiorari on behalf of Sanchez. Thus, whether or not Sanchez had the <em>right </em>to counsel, the fact is he did have counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-4\">\u00b632 As the Court notes, the United States Supreme Court has stated that in matters in which there is no constitutional right to counsel, counsel\u2019s failure to timely pursue discretionary appeals or petitions does not violate a defendant\u2019s right to effective assistance of counsel. Opinion, \u00b6 18. Respectfully, I would not adopt this reasoning in Montana. It is one thing to determine that a defendant has no right to have counsel appointed for a discretionary appeal; it is quite another to conclude that where a defendant actually <em>has </em>counsel, that attorney is not obligated to provide effective assistance.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-5\">\u00b633 The Montana Rules of Professional Conduct (MRPC) obligate all Montana lawyers to be competent, prompt and diligent in all professional functions. Preamble, (5). Rule 1.1 requires that lawyers provide competent representation to a client. Rule 1.3 requires an attorney to act with reasonable diligence and promptness in representing a client. We have held that where a lawyer undertakes to represent a client, he or she violates the duty owed to the client by failing to diligently proceed on the client\u2019s behalf. For example, in <em>In re Halprin, </em>244 Mont. 363, 365-66, 798 P.2d 80, 81-82 (1990), in addition to other violations, we found that attorney Halprin violated MRPC 1.3 when he \u201cfailed to act with reasonable diligence and promptness in representing his client\u201d by allowing the statute of limitations to run on his client\u2019s wrongful death action, justifying <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>sanctions. A lawyer has a duty to perform competently and diligently in <em>all </em>matters. It is simply wrong to implement a rule in criminal matters that competent representation is required of an attorney in cases in which there is a right to counsel, but is not required of counsel in matters in which there is no such right. I would conclude that because Wheelis committed to pursue a petition for certiorari on behalf of Sanchez, he was obligated to provide Sanchez with effective assistance.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-4\">\u00b634 I turn next to the <em>Strickland </em>analysis. As the Court notes at \u00b6 20, we review ineffective assistance of appellate counsel claims under <em>Strickland. </em>Sanchez has acknowledged that he must demonstrate that counsel\u2019s performance was deficient and that the deficient performance prejudiced him. Sanchez has satisfied both prongs.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-5\">\u00b635 First, was Wheelis\u2019 performance deficient? He conceded that it was, calling his failure to file a petition an error attributable to mistake, forgetfulness, or distraction. He testified at the postconviction hearing that a certiorari petition in the <em>Sanchez </em>case \u201cwould have been a slam dunk, as close as you can get to that anyway.\u201d He also testified that he was reasonably certain that his failure to file a petition would not be considered harmless. While we have held that, in determining whether counsel\u2019s conduct was reasonable, \u201cself-proclaimed inadequacies on the part of trial counsel in aid of a client on appeal do not hold great persuasive value with this Court\u201d <em>(State v. Trull, </em>2006 MT 119, \u00b6 22, 332 Mont. 233, 136 P.3d 551), we have never held that missing a critical deadline in the handling of a case due to distraction is reasonable. There is simply no question that such a mistake constitutes deficient performance. Perhaps this is why the Court declined to address this prong of the <em>Strickland </em>analysis. Opinion, \u00b6 21.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-6\">\u00b636 This takes us to the second prong of <em>Strickland, </em>which is whether counsel\u2019s deficient performance prejudiced the defendant. The Court concludes the prejudice prong cannot be met, stating \u201c[bjecause of the very slim odds that the U.S. Supreme Court would have granted Sanchez\u2019s petition, Sanchez has not demonstrated there is a reasonable probability that but for Wheelis\u2019 error, the result of the proceedings would have been different.\u201d Opinion, \u00b6 23. In support of this statement, the Court cites statistics gleaned from the 2009-2011 Year-End Reports on the Federal Judiciary. Respectfully, these statistics do not shed any light on whether certiorari would have likely been granted in this case. However, three decisions made by the United States Supreme Court subsequent to its ruling in <em>Giles </em>do <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>suggest what the outcome of a certiorari petition on behalf of Sanchez would have been.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-4\">\u00b637 Since <em>Giles </em>was decided on June 25, 2008, the Supreme Court has on at least three occasions vacated the convictions of persons whose cases turned on the application of \u201cforfeiture by wrongdoing\u201d exception to the Confrontation Clause, as set forth by the California Supreme Court in <em>Giles. </em>Two days after the Supreme Court overruled California\u2019s <em>Giles </em>decision, it granted certiorari to Darrell Younger, vacated the judgment against him, and remanded the case to the Court of Appeal of California. <em>Younger v. California, </em>554 U.S. 931, 128 S. Ct. 2994 (June 27, 2008). This same \u201cgrant, vacate and remand\u201d procedure (GVR) was also utilized in the case of <em>Banos v. California, </em>555 U.S. 801, 129 S. Ct. 163 (October 6, 2008), and in <em>Moua Her v. Minnesota, </em>555 U.S. 1092, 129 S. Ct. 929 (January 12, 2009). In all three of these cases-as in our 2008 Opinion in Sanchez-the reviewing courts relied on the California <em>Giles </em>decision in upholding the convictions before them; in fact, the Minnesota Supreme Court in <em>Moua Her </em>relied on both <em>Giles </em>and our 2008 Opinion in <em>Sanchez </em>in reaching its decision. In light of this fact, the odds that the Supreme Court would have granted Sanchez\u2019s petition are anything but \u201cslim.\u201d There is clearly a reasonable probability that but for Wheelis\u2019 error, Sanchez\u2019s petition would have been granted and his conviction reversed. As we stated in \u00b6 11 of <em>St. Germain, </em>\u201c[a] reasonable probability is a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome of the proceedings.\u201d \u00b638 I next address the Court\u2019s contention at \u00b6 26 of the Opinion that even if Sanchez had demonstrated that Wheelis was ineffective, the introduction of the handwritten note was harmless error. I submit the Court\u2019s analysis in this regard is wrong for two reasons. First, the Court employs an \u201coverwhelming evidence\u201d analysis in reaching its conclusion. (\u201cOverwhelming other evidence at trial included that on the morning of the homicide,\u201d Sanchez took certain steps in preparation for his crime.) In <em>State v. Van Kirk, </em>2001 MT 184, 306 Mont. 215, 32 P.3d 735, we rejected the use of the \u201coverwhelming evidence\u201d test in answering the question of whether an error is harmless. <em>Van Kirk, </em>\u00b6 43.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-5\">\u00b639 In <em>Van Kirk, </em>we ruled that once a convicted person has established that the evidence in question was erroneously admitted and alleges prejudice, it becomes incumbent upon the State to demonstrate that the error at issue was not prejudicial. <em>Van Kirk, </em>\u00b6 42. We went on to reject the \u201coverwhelming evidence\u201d test, and held that we would instead apply the \u201ccumulative evidence\u201d test in answering <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>the prejudice inquiry. We stated: \u201cThis test looks not to the quantitative effect of other admissible evidence, but rather to whether the fact-finder was presented with admissible evidence that proved <em>the same facts as the tainted evidence proved.\u201d Van Kirk, </em>\u00b6 43 (emphasis in original). We further said that \u201cthe State must also demonstrate that the <em>quality </em>of the tainted evidence was such that there was no reasonable possibility that it might have contributed to the defendant\u2019s conviction.\u201d <em>Van Kirk, </em>\u00b6 44 (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b172-4\">\u00b640 No other evidence properly admitted at trial proved the same facts as the note written by Aleasha. In <em>Sanchez, </em>we concluded that the testimony of Aleasha\u2019s sister to the effect that Sanchez threatened that if Aleasha made him \u201cmad,\u201d his friend from Mexico could supply \u201cstuff\u2019 that \u201cwould eat her stomach in a matter of days,\u201d was not hearsay and was properly admitted. <em>Sanchez, </em>\u00b6 19. However, we concluded the court erred in admitting the testimony of Aleasha\u2019s neighbor Pamela Ehrlich. Ehrlich testified that Aleasha told her that Sanchez said during an argument: \u201c[m]e love you, Aleasha. Me not love you that much. You cross me, I kill you.\u201d We determined that the statement was inadmissible hearsay, but ruled that the admission of the statement was harmless. <em>Sanchez, </em>\u00b6 22.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-5\">\u00b641 In addition to the foregoing evidence, Sanchez\u2019s co-worker Sheehan testified without objection that on his lunch break the day of Aleasha\u2019s death, Sanchez told Sheehan he had just learned that day Aleasha was cheating on him and maybe he would shoot her. <em>Sanchez, </em>\u00b6 24. Sanchez himself also testified, admitting that he shot Aleasha but claiming that when he argued with Aleasha on the day of her death and she threatened to have his children taken away from him, \u201csomething got dark in [his] head\u201d and he shot her. <em>Sanchez, </em>\u00b6 10.</p>\n<p id=\"AyF\">\u00b642 While admitting to homicide, Sanchez argued at trial that the homicide was committed under the influence of \u201cextreme mental or emotional stress for which there is reasonable explanation or excuse\u201d; thus, he argued, the jury should convict him of mitigated deliberate homicide rather than deliberate homicide. <em>Sanchez, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 52, 60. This defense is key to my contention that the admission of the note was not harmless error.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-6\">\u00b643 The date and contents of the note distinguish it from all the other evidence. First, the note was the only evidence that specifically tied Sanchez\u2019s threat to kill Aleasha to her dating another man behind his back. Aleasha\u2019s sister\u2019s testimony did not make this connection. While Sheehan\u2019s testimony did connect the threat to infidelity, Sheehan\u2019s conversation with Sanchez occurred on the day Sanchez shot Aleasha <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>and just after Sanchez learned of her infidelity. Sheehan\u2019s testimony therefore arguably supported Sanchez\u2019s contention that he was overcome that day by extreme emotional distress. Second, the note referenced a conversation that ostensibly occurred between Aleasha and Sanchez <em>eleven days </em>before her death. The note, therefore, greatly undermined Sanchez\u2019s contention that it was the stress of learning of her infidelity and being threatened with losing his children <em>on the day of her death </em>that led to the shooting. The note introduced a factor that no other evidence proved: that over a week prior to the shooting, he may have contemplated killing her if she was unfaithful to him. Because the jury did not hear other evidence that proved the same thing as the \u201ctainted evidence,\u201d reversal on the basis of the \u201ccumulative evidence\u201d test is compelled under <em>Van Kirk. Van Kirk, </em>\u00b6 45.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-4\">\u00b644 Finally, the Court errs in concluding that the note\u2019s admission had no impact on the outcome of Sanchez\u2019s trial. Opinion, \u00b6 26. Given Sanchez\u2019s admission to the homicide, the trial had only two possible outcomes-a conviction of deliberate homicide or a conviction of the lesser charge of mitigated deliberate homicide. For the reasons outlined above, there is a significant likelihood that the note convinced the jury that the homicide was not mitigated. <em>Van Kirk </em>dictates that there can be no reasonable possibility that the tainted evidence might have contributed to the defendant\u2019s conviction. <em>Van Kirk, </em>\u00b6 44. That threshold cannot be met here. Therefore, I would reverse the District Court order denying Sanchez\u2019s petition for postconviction relief, grant the petition, and remand for a new trial, barring the introduction of Aleasha\u2019s note.</p>\n<judges id=\"b173-5\">JUSTICE NELSON joins the Dissent of JUSTICE COTTER.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b162-10\"> Sanchez raised other claims in his original petition for postconviction relief, including ineffective assistance of trial counsel for failing to object to Aleasha\u2019s statements to a neighbor and her sister on grounds they violated his confrontational right, and ineffective assistance of appellate counsel for failing to challenge trial counsel as ineffective. The District Court denied all of these claims, and Sanchez has not challenged these rulings on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b163-7\"> The State argues that Sanchez\u2019s Confrontation Clause argument is also barred by res judicata and the law of the case doctrine, but because we are not addressing the Confrontation Clause issue, we do not take up these arguments.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b164-6\"> <em>Martinez v.
