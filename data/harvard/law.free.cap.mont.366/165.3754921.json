HCS appeals the decision of the Montana First Judicial District Court. We vacate the judgment and remand the matter to the District Court for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-8\">ISSUES</p>\n<p id=\"b192-9\">\u00b62 A restatement of the issues on appeal is:</p>\n<p id=\"b192-10\">\u00b63 Did the District Court err by granting Mountain West\u2019s motion for summary judgment without complying with the requirements of \u00a7 71-1-222, MCA?</p>\n<p id=\"b192-11\">\u00b64 Did the District Court err by entering a judgment that did not comply with \u00a7 25-9-203, MCA?</p>\n<p id=\"b192-12\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b192-13\">\u00b65 In August 2005, Helena Christian School borrowed $90,000 from Mountain West Bank at an annual interest rate of 7.25%. The loan documents allowed an interest rate increase of 3% in the event of default. Defendants Erdahl, Fuller and Hitzeroth signed the loan documents as personal guarantors. This loan was originally due in August 2006 but the maturity date was extended on several occasions with a final due date of February 9, 2010. While according to the loan documents, the interest rate changed during these loan extensions, the interest rate as of the last extension was again at 7.25%. The $90,000 loan was an unsecured loan.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-14\">\u00b66 In December 2008, the School took out a second loan and borrowed approximately $1,500,000 from the Bank at an annual interest rate of 7.25%. The original maturity date was December 29, 2010. The 2008 promissory note did not impose an interest rate increase in the event of default. In May 2009, the loan terms were renegotiated. A new maturity date of April 2010 was established, the interest rate was reduced to 6%, and a 3% point margin increase was imposed upon default. Subsequently, the maturity date was extended <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>to August 2010. The seven defendants signed the loan documents as personal guarantors. Notably, this loan was secured by a mortgage on real property in Lewis and Clark County located near the Helena-based school.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-3\">\u00b67 On November 19, 2010, the Bank filed a complaint against HCS alleging breach of contract and default of both loans and seeking judicial foreclosure. At the time the Complaint was filed the Bank claimed the School owed $55,976.91 in principal on the $90,000 loan and $1,807.75 of accrued interest through November 19, 2010. Citing a 10.25% interest rate, the Bank claimed interest accumulating at the daily rate of $15.7195. Mountain West also asserted that HCS owed it $1,470,751.74 principal on the $1.5 million loan, plus $52,526.56 in accrued interest through November 19,2010, $9,192.66 in late fees and costs, and $120 in court costs. The Bank claimed that this loan continued to accrue interest at 9% per annum, or $362.6511 per day. \u00b68 The School moved to dismiss the Complaintin December 2010 and in March 2011 the District Court denied the motion. On April 19,2011, the Bank moved for summary judgment and on November 16, 2011, the District Court granted the Bank\u2019s motion. The court recited in its order that the Bank had sued to foreclose on the two promissory notes, that the School had defaulted on both loans, and that none of the guarantors had honored their obligations on the notes. Because the School had not contradicted the Bank\u2019s claims, the court determined that the Bank was entitled to judgment as a matter of law. It is from this ruling the School appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-4\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b193-5\">\u00b69 We review the grant of summary judgment de novo, using the same M. R. Civ. P. 56 criteria used by the district court. Summary judgment is appropriate when the moving party demonstrates both the absence of any genuine issues of material fact and entitlement to judgment as a matter of law. <em>Styren Farms, Inc. v. Roos, </em>2011 MT 299, \u00b6 10, 363 Mont. 41, 265 P.3d 1230.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b193-7\">\u00b610 <em>Did the District Court err by granting Mountain West\u2019s motion for summary judgment without complying with the requirements of\u00a7 71-1-222, MCA ?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b193-8\">\u00b611 In the District Court, the School argued that the Bank failed to comply with Montana\u2019s \u201cone action\u201d rule. On appeal, they argue that the District Court erred in failing to acknowledge and require <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>compliance with this rule, and that the court\u2019s summary judgment order from which appeal is taken must therefore be vacated.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-4\">\u00b612 Section 71-1-222, MCA, known as the \u201cone action\u201d rule, addresses proceedings in a foreclosure suit. In relevant part, it states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b194-5\">(1) There is only one action for the recovery of debt or the enforcement of any right secured by a mortgage upon real estate, and that action must be in accordance with the provisions of this part. In the action, the court may, by its judgment, direct:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b194-6\">(a) a sale of the encumbered property or as much of the property as may be necessary;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b194-7\">(b) the application of the proceeds of the sale, including the payment of property taxes due at the time of foreclosure; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b194-8\">(c) the payment of the costs of the court, the expenses of the sale, and the amount due the plaintiff.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b194-9\">(2) If it appears from the sheriffs return that the proceeds are insufficient and a balance still remains due, judgment can then be docketed for the balance against the defendant or defendants personally liable for the debt, and it becomes a lien upon the real estate of the judgment debtor, as in other cases on which execution may be issued.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b194-10\">\u00b613 The purpose of this statute is two-fold: first, it protects the mortgagor-in this case, the School-from having to defend two actions against it. Under common law, a mortgagor could be sued by a secured creditor to collect the unpaid debt under the promissory note <em>and </em>be sued in equity seeking forfeiture of the property used as security or collateral. The one-action rule prevents such dual actions against the debtor. Second, the statute compels the creditor who holds the mortgage on the land to resolve the indebtedness through sale of the secured property first, before attempting to reach the mortgagor\u2019s unmortgaged property. <em>FDIC v. Shoop, </em>2 F.3d 948, 950 (9th Cir. 1993). In <em>Shoop, </em>the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, applying \u00a7 71-1-222, MCA, observed that under the statute, \u201cfirst the property is sold, and then, if the sale proceeds leave a balance due on the note, judgment is entered for the difference.\u201d <em>Shoop, </em>2 F.3d at 951.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-11\">\u00b614  In the case before us, this statute applies to the $1.5 million loan secured by real property, and not to the $90,000 loan which, as noted above, was an unsecured loan. In <em>Federal Land Bank v. Heidema, </em>224 Mont. 64, 727 P.2d 1336 (1986), we noted that in foreclosure proceedings under \u00a7 71-1-222, MCA, \u201c[t]he court, by its judgment in a mortgage foreclosure action, directs the sheriff to make the <em>sale.\u201d Heidema, </em>224 Mont. at 67, 727 P.2d at 1338. In this case, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>District Court granted summary judgment on the notes and docketed judgment for an unspecified amount but did not direct the sale of the property or otherwise even acknowledge \u00a7 71-1-222, MCA. Under the statute, <em>Shoop, </em>and <em>Heidema, </em>this was error. We therefore reverse and remand for compliance with \u00a7 71-1-222, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-3\">\u00b615 Did the <em>District Court err by entering a judgment that did not comply with \u00a7 25-9-203, MCA?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b195-4\">\u00b616 The School further argues that the District Court\u2019s order granting summary judgment does not comply with \u00a7 25-9-203, MCA, and should be vacated. Chapter 9 of Title 25 addresses all types of civil judgments. Section 25-9-203, MCA, identifies what judgments must contain and specifically states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b195-5\">How amount expressed. In judgments, the amount thereof must be computed and stated as near as may be in dollars and cents, rejecting fractions of a cent.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b195-6\">\u00b617 The court\u2019s order briefly recounts the origins of the School\u2019s loans and states that \u201cHelena Christian defaulted on both loans, and none of the individual guarantors have honored their obligation on the loans.\u201d The court continued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b195-7\">Defendants have not provided any evidence that contradicts the evidence presented by Mountain West or that raised a disputed issue of material fact, other than disputing the rate of interest on the 2008 loan and subsequent modifications. Those documents speak for themselves. The loan-related documents attached to the complaint contain the material facts that entitle Mountain West to judgment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b195-8\">However, the order does not distinguish between the secured and unsecured loans and it neither states nor computes the amount of the judgment entered against the Defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-9\">\u00b618 The Bank counters that the order complies with \u00a7 25-9-203, MCA, because its summary judgment motion \u201ccomputed the amounts owed under the loans in question with specificity, and requested that the District Court issue a Judgment in conformity with the amounts due.\u201d \u00b619 This argument is unpersuasive. The Bank\u2019s brief in support of its summary judgment motion provided the loan information recited above in paragraph 7. However, neither the brief in support of summary judgment nor the order granting summary judgment reflected the amounts due as of the day the court entered summary judgment. The amount due, among other things, would have included interest accrued since November 19, 2010. Moreover, the Bank\u2019s brief expressly stated: \u201cThe balance due under [these loans] ... has been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>stated by Plaintiff. Therefore, the exact amount of Judgment can be entered by mathematical calculation once [the District Court] enters Summary Judgment on liability in favor of Plaintiff.\u201d As the court\u2019s summary judgment order did not compute or include the precise amount of judgment, it does not comply with \u00a7 25-9-203, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-4\">\u00b620 Lastly, the School raises questions concerning what interest rate should apply to the defaulted $1.5 million loan. In light of the several revisions to the loan documents, it is difficult to ascertain what the controlling rate should be. This issue of fact should be resolved upon remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-5\">\u00b621  In summary, upon remand, the District Court must compute and state the exact judgment amount, including interest, pertaining to the unsecured $90,000 loan. As for the secured $1.5 million loan, the court must comply with the provisions of \u00a7 71-1-222, MCA. Upon receipt of notice of the proceeds received in the sheriffs sale, in the event of a deficiency, the court must determine the appropriate rate of interest vis-a-vis the deficiency, and enter an order of judgment computing and stating the amount owed by Defendants. At that time the judgment on the secured loan may be docketed.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-6\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b196-7\">\u00b622 For the foregoing reasons, we vacate the District Court\u2019s judgment and remand for further proceedings in accordance with this Opinion.</p>\n<judges id=\"b196-8\">JUSTICES MORRIS, WHEAT, NELSON and BAKER concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
