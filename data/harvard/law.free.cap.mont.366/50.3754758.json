We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-10\">\u00b62 We review the following issues on appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b77-11\">\u00b63 <em>1. Whether Rosling received ineffective assistance of counsel during his trial.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b77-12\">\u00b64 <em>2. Whether Rosling received ineffective assistance of counsel during his appeal.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b77-13\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b77-14\">\u00b65 A jury found Rosling guilty of deliberate homicide, aggravated kidnapping, aggravated burglary, tampering with or fabricating physical evidence, and criminal possession of dangerous drugs on October 18, 2004. Attorney Randi Hood (Hood) represented Rosling throughout his criminal proceedings. The district court sentenced Rosling to life in prison without parole for the homicide conviction. The court imposed concurrent sentences for the other convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-15\">\u00b66 Rosling filed a notice of appeal. The court appointed attorney William Hooks (Hooks) as Rosling\u2019s appellate counsel. Rosling appealed the district court\u2019s denial of his motion to dismiss charges for insufficient evidence. We affirmed Rosling\u2019s convictions and sentences in <em>State v. Rosling, </em>2008 MT 62, \u00b6 1, 342 Mont. 1, 180 P.3d 1102.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>\u00b67 Rosling petitioned the District Court for postconviction relief. Rosling argued that Hood had rendered ineffective assistance of counsel by failing to pursue testing of a latent palm print and failing to object to portions of the State\u2019s closing argument. Rosling argued that Hooks had rendered ineffective assistance of counsel on appeal by failing to raise the district court\u2019s denial of Rosling\u2019s motion for a mistrial and Rosling\u2019s alleged absence from a stage of proceedings. The District Court denied Rosling\u2019s petition following an evidentiary hearing in an order issued on August 23, 2011. Rosling appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-4\">\u00b68 We outlined the general facts regarding Rosling\u2019s conviction in his direct appeal. <em>Rosling, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 3-30. The following facts pertain to Rosling\u2019s petition for postconviction relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-5\">Palm Print and Rosling\u2019s Access to Evidence</p>\n<p id=\"AG\">\u00b69 Police officers took a latent palm print from a bathroom mirror at the victim\u2019s apartment while investigating the murder. The officers sent the latent palm print to the Montana Division of Forensic Science Crime Laboratory for testing. A forensic scientist at the lab, Debra Hewitt (Hewitt), investigated the palm print. Hewitt did not receive Rosling\u2019s palm print for testing, and so could not compare the two. Hewitt ruled out the possibility of the palm print belonging to the victim. Rosling had insisted that Hood test the palm print to establish the source. Hewitt determined that the palm print did not belong to Rosling three months after Rosling\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-6\">\u00b610 Hood testified at the PCR hearing that she could not recall whether the State had tried to take Rosling\u2019s palm prints for testing. Rosling informed Hood before his trial that he had not entered the victim\u2019s bathroom on the day of the murder. Hood testified that she discussed the evidence with Rosling and that he knew her trial strategy. Hood hesitated to pursue the testing of the palm print in light of her concern that the testing could link Rosling to the print and the murder. Hood acknowledged, however, that conclusive evidence that the palm print did not belong to Rosling would have been favorable to his defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-7\">\u00b611 Rosling further testified that he believed Hood withheld information from him while he was in jail before trial. Rosling claimed that he had requested various documents and videos related to his trial and that Hood failed to provide them. Hood testified that she had expressed concerns to Rosling about \u201csnitches\u201d in jail, and did not allow Rosling to have evidence in his possession while in jail. Hood visited Rosling often while he was in jail. Rosling spoke with another inmate about his case after he was transferred to the jail\u2019s general <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>population. Hood disapproved of Rosling\u2019s discussions with potential \u201csnitches.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b79-4\">Lack of Objections to Prosecution\u2019s Misstatements</p>\n<p id=\"AoU\">\u00b612 The State argued in closing that Rosling admitted to having been \u201cred-handed.\u201d This argument misstated Rosling\u2019s testimony. The State asked Rosling on cross-examination, \u201cSo you were red-handed with blood when you stuck your hand into that brand new ski glove?\u201d Rosling answered, \u201cNo, I did not have a red hand.\u201d Hood testified that the prosecutor had veered close to, or actually had committed, misconduct by misstating the facts in closing. Hood admitted that she probably should have objected to the \u201cred-handed\u201d remark, but that she did not want to object too much during a closing argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-5\">\u00b613 A neighbor of the victim, Rosaline Diehl (Diehl), testified during Rosling\u2019s trial that she saw a car and person matching Rosling\u2019s description on the morning of the murder. The State argued in its closing that Diehl would gain nothing by lying to the jury. Hood did not object. Hood testified at the PCR hearing that the State\u2019s insinuations about Diehl\u2019s credibility amounted to prosecutorial misconduct. Hood testified that she did not object, however, based on her strategy to have part of Diehl\u2019s testimony-relating to the description of what she saw early the morning of the murder-believed by the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-6\">\u00b614 The State further argued in closing that a beard hair found at the crime scene matched Rosling\u2019s mitochondrial DNA. This argument failed to track the testimony of the State\u2019s DNA expert, Thomas Fedor (Fedor). Fedor testified that the hair\u2019s DNA and Rosling\u2019s DNA \u201care the same in every location except one.\u201d Fedor testified that he could not state unequivocally that the hair belonged to Rosling. Hood did not object to the prosecution\u2019s statement regarding the DNA. Hood testified at the PCR hearing that the prosecution made the DNA misstatement in its rebuttal closing argument, and that accordingly, she could not counter the DNA statement. Hood also testified that she worried about \u201cthe risk of how [another objection] is seen by the jury.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b79-7\">Inadmissible Photos</p>\n<p id=\"b79-8\">\u00b6 15 Police photographed Rosling after his arrest. These photos showed Rosling\u2019s distinctive \u201cSS\u201d and Swastika tattoos. Hood filed a motion in limine to exclude the photos due to their inflammatory and prejudicial nature. The district court granted the motion to exclude the photos. \u00b616 The State used PowerPoint to show numerous photos to the jury throughout the trial. During the State\u2019s examination of Detective Bryan Fischer, the State published photos to the jury that showed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>Rosling\u2019s tattoos. Hood objected immediately and the District Court admonished the State. The State again in its direct examination published similarly objectionable photos to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-4\">\u00b617 Hood moved for a mistrial based on the publication of the photos to the jury. The State maintained that it inadvertently had published the photos for only a \u201cfew seconds.\u201d The court denied Hood\u2019s motion and determined that the publication was \u201cinadvertent, it was quick, and [the photos] were small in nature.\u201d Hood rejected the court\u2019s offer to give a curative instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-5\">\u00b618 Hooks testified that he had been aware that the court had denied Rosling\u2019s motion for a mistrial and that the jury saw the photos twice. Hooks testified that he did not pursue the issue on appeal due to the fact that he believed Rosling had other, more compelling issues related to the soundness of his conviction. Rosling testified that he did not recall Hooks discussing the mistrial issue with him.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-6\">Rosling\u2019s Absence</p>\n<p id=\"b80-7\">\u00b619 Rosling also testified that he had not been present for an in-chambers meeting. This meeting involved the defense\u2019s intent to call a police officer to impeach Diehl\u2019s original statement about what Diehl had seen on the morning of the murder. The trial record does not reflect whether Rosling was present at this in-chambers meeting, or whether he waived his right to be present. Hood did not recall whether Rosling was present. Hooks does not remember discussing the issue with Rosling. Hooks additionally testified that the record was insufficient to pursue on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-8\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b80-9\">\u00b620 We review for clear error a district court\u2019s findings of fact in postconviction relief proceedings. <em>Rogers v. State, </em>2011 MT 105, \u00b6 12, 360 Mont. 334, 253 P.3d 889. We review for correctness a district court\u2019s conclusions of law in postconviction relief proceedings. <em>Rogers, </em>\u00b6 12. We review de novo a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. <em>Hamilton v. State, </em>2010 MT 25, \u00b6 7, 355 Mont. 133, 226 P.3d 588.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-10\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b80-11\">\u00b621 <em>Whether Rosling received ineffective assistance of counsel during his trial.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b80-12\">\u00b622 Rosling alleges that Hood provided ineffective assistance of counsel at several stages in his trial. Rosling cites Hood\u2019s failure to investigate, test, and present the palm print and Hood\u2019s failure to object to statements made by the State during closing arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>\u00b623 We apply the two-part test established in <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668 (1984), to determine whether counsel rendered ineffective assistance. <em>Rogers, </em>f 15. A defendant must show that counsel\u2019s representation was deficient, and that counsel\u2019s deficient representation prejudiced the defense. <em>Rogers, </em>\u00b6 15. A petitioner for post-conviction relief must prove by a preponderance of evidence that he is entitled to relief. <em>Rogers, </em>\u00b6 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-4\">\u00b624  The fact that a counsel\u2019s challenged conduct may be characterized as \u201cstrategic\u201d or \u201ctactical\u201d does not excuse ineffective assistance on the part of counsel. <em>Whitlow v. State, </em>2008 MT 140, \u00b6 18, 343 Mont. 90, 183 P.3d 861. We analyze instead whether counsel\u2019s conduct, regardless of its characterization as \u201cstrategic\u201d or \u201ctactical,\u201d proved reasonable under the circumstances. Thus, a defendant \u201cmust show that a counsel\u2019s representation fell below an objective standard of reasonableness\u201d in order to establish deficient performance. <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 688.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-5\">a. Exculpatory Evidence</p>\n<p id=\"b81-6\">\u00b625 Rosling argues that Hood failed to meet the \u201coverarching duty of a criminal defense counsel.\u201d <em>State v. Henderson, </em>2004 MT 173, \u00b6 7, 322 Mont. 69, 93 P.3d 1231. This duty consists of advocating on behalf of the defendant, and meeting, testing, and refuting the case of the prosecution. <em>Henderson, </em>\u00b6 7. Rosling argues that the palm print constituted exculpatory evidence that Hood failed to investigate. Rosling insists that Hood had the duty to investigate, test, and present the palm print.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-7\">\u00b626  The Montana Division of Forensic Science Crime Laboratory did not test the palm print against Rosling\u2019s. Hood testified that she did not pursue further testing of the palm print for strategic reasons. Hood argued to the jury in closing that the State had failed to pin the palm print on Rosling. Hood\u2019s decision not to investigate further the palm print does not meet the first prong of <em>Strickland. </em>Hood decided not to pursue further evidence that may have proven harmful to her client. Hood\u2019s decision to avoid a potentially adverse development for Rosling stands as reasonable under the circumstances. The District Court properly concluded that Hood acted well within the parameters of reasonableness.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-8\">b. Failure to Object to Prosecution\u2019s Misstatements</p>\n<p id=\"b81-9\">\u00b627 Rosling argues that Hood rendered ineffective assistance through her failure to object to the State\u2019s comments regarding Rosling being \u201cred-handed.\u201d Rosling contends that the State\u2019s allegation amounted to prosecutorial misconduct, and that Hood\u2019s failure to object deprived <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>Rosling of his right to a fair trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-4\">\u00b628 Rosling additionally argues that Hood should have objected to the prosecution\u2019s reference to Diehl\u2019s credibility. Rosling points out that this Court has determined that it is improper for the State to \u201coffer personal opinions regarding the credibility of a witness.\u201d <em>State v. Daniels, </em>2003 MT 247, \u00b6 26, 317 Mont. 331, 77 P.3d 224. Hood testified in the PCR hearing that the defense took the position that Diehl was a credible witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-5\">\u00b629 Rosling finally contends that Hood rendered ineffective assistance by failing to object to the State\u2019s misstatement regarding the DNA evidence as matching Rosling\u2019s DNA. The District Court noted the minor nature of the prosecution\u2019s misstatement. Fedor testified that Rosling\u2019s DNA matched the hair in each sequence but one. Fedor explained that Rosling\u2019s DNA could indeed be a perfect match to the hair. Fedor testified that he could confirm that match through further testing. The prosecution\u2019s statement thus did not technically misstate the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-6\">\u00b630  The District Court determined that Hood\u2019s decisions not to object to the statements regarding the \u201cred-handed\u201d comment, the question regarding Diehl\u2019s testimony, or the DNA understatement were tactical. We agree. The decision to object during an opening or closing argument falls well within the range of permissible professional legal conduct. <em>Dawson v. State, </em>2000 MT 219, \u00b6 105, 301 Mont. 135, 10 P.3d 49. Hood testified that she based her decisions not to object during the State\u2019s closing argument on the court\u2019s reaction to previous objections during closing argument. Rosling has failed to demonstrate that Hood\u2019s choice not to object fell below the level of objective reasonableness that could equate to ineffective assistance. <em>Whitlow, </em>\u00b6 20.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-7\">\u00b631 <em>Whether Rosling received ineffective assistance of counsel during his appeal.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b82-8\">\u00b632 We review claims of ineffective assistance of counsel on direct appeal according to the <em>Strickland </em>standard. <em>Hagen v. State, </em>1999 MT 8, \u00b6 10, 293 Mont. 60, 973 P.2d 233. Appellate counsel has no obligation, however, to raise every possible non-frivolous issue on appeal. <em>DuBray v. State, </em>2008 MT 121, \u00b6 31, 342 Mont. 520, 182 P.3d 753.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-9\">a. Motion for Mistrial</p>\n<p id=\"b82-10\">\u00b633 Rosling argues that Hooks\u2019s failure to appeal the district court\u2019s ruling on a mistrial motion constituted ineffective assistance of counsel. Hooks admitted that the photo of Rosling represented a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>legitimate legal basis upon which to appeal. The district court overruled Hood\u2019s objection to the State\u2019s display of the photo, but offered to give a curative instruction. Rosling\u2019s counsel declined the offer. Hooks explained his decision not to raise the issue on appeal, in part, due to the fact that no copy of the photo exists in the district record. The District Court determined that Hooks made a reasonable decision not to pursue the issue on appeal. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-4\">\u00b634  Hooks raised on direct appeal the issues of the sufficiency of evidence in a circumstantial case and Rosling\u2019s ineligibility for parole. Hooks reasonably selected two issues that could have changed Rosling\u2019s conviction and sentence. Hooks testified that he narrowed a myriad of issues down to ones he thought were \u201cmeritorious issues that merit careful consideration.\u201d Hooks acted well within the bounds of reasonableness in his decision not to raise the issue of the court\u2019s denial of a mistrial on appeal. <em>Dubray, </em>\u00b6 31.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-5\">b. Rosling\u2019s alleged absence</p>\n<p id=\"b83-6\">\u00b635 Rosling additionally argues that Hooks\u2019s failure to appeal Rosling\u2019s absence from a critical proceeding constituted ineffective assistance. This Court has emphasized repeatedly that Article II, Section 24 of the Montana Constitution expressly guarantees a criminal defendant the right to be present at all stages of his trial. <em>State v. Price, </em>2009 MT 129, \u00b6 22, 350 Mont. 272, 207 P.3d 298.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-7\">\u00b636 Hooks explained that he could not establish conclusively on appeal that Rosling had been absent from the meeting in the judge\u2019s chambers. The record reflects only who spoke in the in-chamber discussions. Rosling did not speak as he was represented by counsel. The record does not establish who was present.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-8\">\u00b637  Hood testified at the PCR hearing that she could not recall whether Rosling was present. Hood testified, however, that it was her routine and practice to ensure that her clients were present for in-chambers meetings. We agree that the record does not establish whether Rosling was present at the in-chambers meeting. Hooks could not have rendered ineffective assistance of counsel by not pursuing a claim of a Sixth Amendment violation on appeal under these circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-9\">\u00b638 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b83-10\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES COTTER, NELSON and RICE concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b83-11\">JUSTICE NELSON,</author>\n<p id=\"ABy\">concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-12\">\u00b639 I concur in the Court\u2019s decision. I write separately to address the parties\u2019 discussions about whether the decisions made by Rosling\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>attorneys were \u201ctactical\u201d and \u201cstrategic,\u201d and also the failure of postconviction petitioners in general to make proper showings in support of their ineffective assistance claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-4\">\u00b640 In <em>Whitlow v. State, </em>2008 MT 140, 343 Mont. 90, 183 P.3d 861, this Court went to great lengths to disavow any further reliance on the so-called \u201cignorance or neglect\u201d test, which \u201ccontemplates a compartmentalization of counsel\u2019s challenged acts and omissions as either strategic decisions/trial tactics on one hand or ignorance/neglect on the other.\u201d <em>Whitlow, </em>\u00b6 17. We observed that under the first prong of the two-part <em>Strickland </em>test-i.e., whether counsel\u2019s performance was deficient-11 \u2018the defendant must show that counsel\u2019s representation fell below an objective standard of reasonableness.\u2019 \u201d <em>Whitlow, </em>1 14 (quoting <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 688, 104 S. Ct. at 2064). In other words, \u201c \u2018[t]he proper measure of attorney performance remains simply reasonableness under prevailing professional norms.\u2019 \u201d <em>Whitlow, </em>\u00b6 14 (brackets in original) (quoting <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 688, 104 S. Ct. at 2065).</p>\n<p id=\"b84-5\">\u00b641 The \u201cignorance or neglect\u201d test, we explained, is not consistent with this inquiry into objective reasonableness. <em>Whitlow, </em>\u00b6 17. Critically, we noted that \u201cthe fact that counsel\u2019s challenged conduct may be categorized as \u2018strategic\u2019 or \u2018tactical\u2019 does not necessarily mean that the conduct was objectively reasonable.\u201d <em>Whitlow, </em>\u00b6 18. Indeed, \u201c[i]t is possible ... for a strategic choice to be unreasonable-e.g., because it was made after less than complete investigation, and prevailing professional norms would have required further investigation.\u201d <em>Whitlow, </em>\u00b6 18; <em>see also e.g. Lawhorn v. Allen, </em>519 F.3d 1272, 1295 (11th Cir. 2008) (\u201cTactical or strategic decisions based on a misunderstanding of the law are unreasonable.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b84-6\">\u00b642 Accordingly, \u201cthe issue is not whether counsel\u2019s challenged conduct may be characterized as \u2018strategic\u2019 or \u2018tactical\u2019; rather, it is whether that conduct-strategic, tactical, or otherwise-was \u2018reasonable\u2019 under prevailing professional norms and in light of surrounding circumstances.\u201d <em>Whitlow, </em>\u00b6 18 n. 4; <em>accord </em>Opinion, \u00b6 24. For this reason, we overruled the proposition, contained in a number of our prior cases, that defense counsel\u2019s trial tactics and strategic decisions cannot be the basis upon which to find ineffective assistance of counsel. <em>See Whitlow, </em>\u00b6 18 n. 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-7\">\u00b643 In reviewing the record and the parties\u2019 briefs on appeal, it appears to me that our clarifications in <em>Whitlow </em>have largely been lost on Rosling and the State. Notwithstanding <em>Whitlow, </em>the State repeatedly characterizes Hood\u2019s and Hooks\u2019 decisions as \u201cstrategic\u201d or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>\u201ctactical.\u201d In response, Rosling cites the relevant portion of <em>Whitlow </em>in his reply brief. Nevertheless, much of the discussion in both of his briefs is focused on whether certain of his counsel\u2019s decisions were \u201cstrategic\u201d or \u201ctactical.\u201d And at the postconviction hearing in the District Court, Rosling and the State questioned Hood and Hooks specifically about whether they had \u201cstrategic\u201d or \u201ctactical\u201d reasons for their decisions in his case. Such focus is misplaced. \u201cEven if [counsel\u2019s] decision could be considered one of strategy, that does not render it immune from attack-it must be a <em>reasonable </em>strategy.\u201d <em>Jones v. Wood, </em>114 F.3d 1002, 1010 (9th Cir. 1997) (emphasis in original); <em>see also State v. Harris, </em>2001 MT 231, \u00b6 22, 306 Mont. 525, 36 P.3d 372 (\u201cWhen a tactical or strategic reason for defense counsel\u2019s alleged deficient performance is apparent in the record on appeal or proffered by counsel in post-conviction proceedings, the court must evaluate whether this underlying reason is \u2018reasonable\u2019....\u201d), <em>abrogated in part on other grounds, Robinson v. State, </em>2010 MT 108, \u00b6 12 n. 1, 356 Mont. 282, 232 P.3d 403. Therefore, even assuming, for the sake of argument, that Hood and Hooks had \u201cstrategic\u201d and \u201ctactical\u201d reasons for what they did or did not do, the relevant question is whether their conduct \u201cfell below an objective standard of reasonableness.\u201d <em>Whitlow, </em>\u00b6 20. It is not sufficient that counsel had a \u201cstrategy.\u201d What matters is whether her decision was objectively reasonable \u201cmeasured under prevailing professional norms and in light of the surrounding circumstances.\u201d <em>Whitlow, </em>\u00b6 20.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-4\">\u00b644 <em>Whitlow </em>has been on the books now for over four years, and we have repeated the foregoing standard time and again in numerous cases since <em>Whitlow. </em>Yet, defendants continually fail to present evidence of the \u201cprevailing professional norms\u201d against which their counsel\u2019s conduct must be measured. Indeed, I do not recall seeing one single case in which such evidence was presented. I cannot imagine that a plaintiff in a medical malpractice action could expect to prevail on her claim without presenting evidence of the standard of care applicable to the defendant physician. Postconviction petitioners, however, by and large proceed on the premise that conclusory criticisms of their counsel\u2019s performance-with the convenient benefit of20/20 hindsight-are sufficient to entitle them to relief. Granted, the postconviction context is distinguishable from the med-mal context in that there are certain obligations applicable to attorneys, and testimony regarding prevailing professional norms would not be needed in such situations. <em>See e.g. State v. Kougl, </em>2004 MT 243, \u00b6\u00b6 15-24, 323 Mont. 6, 97 P.3d 1095 (where counsel was faced with an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>obligatory action, the only question is whether counsel acted accordingly; likewise, where there is \u201cno plausible justification\u201d for what counsel did or did not do, such as failing to request a \u201cviewed with distrust\u201d instruction to the jury, then counsel\u2019s performance is per se deficient). But in any event, it is necessary for a postconviction petitioner either to cite legal authority that squarely establishes what his counsel\u2019s obligations were under the circumstances or to present testimony establishing what the prevailing professional norms are. Make no mistake, this is \u201ca heavy burden.\u201d Whitlow, \u00b6 21. But that is the nature of postconviction proceedings. As we have stated, there is \u201c <em>\u2018a </em>strong presumption that counsel\u2019s conduct falls within the wide range of reasonable professional assistance.\u2019 \u201d <em>Whitlow, </em>\u00b6 21 (quoting <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 689, 104 S. Ct. at 2065).</p>\n<p id=\"b86-4\">\u00b645 Since I became a member of this Court in 1993, I have seen ineffective assistance claims climb from a relative few to a point where they are de rigueur after every trial and every appeal. This Court is inundated with ineffective assistance claims-and in far and away most cases, they are an utter and complete waste of the time and resources of this Court, not to mention those of the district courts and the defense and prosecution bars. Certainly no trial is perfect. But the law does not require that a defendant receive a perfect trial,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and it is long overdue that the defense bar and self-represented defendants accept that legal principle. Instead of Monday morning quarterbacking defense or appellate counsel with second guesses about their \u201ctactics\u201d and \u201cstrategy,\u201d an ineffective assistance claim must be grounded in actual evidence that a prevailing professional norm-i.e., the applicable standard of care-was violated. This means that counsel or the self-represented litigant must call an expert witness to the stand and establish what the standard of care is and how trial or appellate counsel violated that standard by what he or she did or did not do. This is a tough burden, especially for the defendant without counsel, but it is meant to be. Every case does not merit an ineffective assistance claim; there simply are not that many constitutionally ineffective attorneys practicing criminal law in this State. Accordingly, as far as I am concerned, given our directive in <em>Whitlow, </em>absent that sort of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>standard-of-care evidence, or a valid \u201cno plausible justification\u201d or \u201cobligatory action\u201d situation (and legitimate cases of this type will be few and far between), it will be my recommendation to the Court that the ineffective assistance claim be summarily dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-4\">\u00b646 In the present case, I am not persuaded that Rosling has overcome the presumption that counsel\u2019s conduct falls within the wide range of reasonable professional assistance. <em>Whitlow, </em>\u00b6 21. Rosling has not demonstrated that either of his attorneys was faced with an obligatory action and failed to act accordingly. Rosling has not shown that there was \u201cno plausible justification\u201d for what counsel did or did not do. And Rosling has not presented evidence of the prevailing professional norms by which his attorneys\u2019 alleged acts and omissions are to be judged. In these circumstances, the District Court would have been fully justified in summarily dismissing Rosling\u2019s petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-5\">\u00b647 I concur.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b86-5\"><em> Brown v.
