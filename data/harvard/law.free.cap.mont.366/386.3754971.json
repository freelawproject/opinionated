Armstrongs filed a petition for a proposed parenting plan in the Fourteenth Judicial District, Musselshell County. The District Court dismissed Armstrongs\u2019 petition for lack of jurisdiction. We reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-12\">\u00b62 Armstrongs present the following issue on appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b413-13\">\u00b63 <em>Whether the District Court possessedjurisdiction to grant parental rights to Armstrongs even though the natural mother\u2019s parental rights have not been terminated.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b413-14\">PROCEDURAL AND FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b413-15\">\u00b64 Armstrongs began raising M.M.G. when the child was approximately one year old. Gail was stopped at a gas station in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>Roundup, Montana, one Friday in 2001 when she saw Arrah Lane (Lane) holding the child M.M.G. Gail did not know Lane. Gail commented to Lane what a beautiful child M.M.G. was. Lane then asked Gail if she wanted M.M.G. Lane proceeded to gather M.M.G.\u2019s things from her vehicle and hand them to Gail.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-4\">\u00b65 Armstrongs cared for M.M.G. for the weekend. Lane contacted Gail the following Monday to pick up M.M.G. Gail told Lane she was willing to care for M.M.G. if Lane needed help. Lane began leaving M.M.G. with Gail several days a week. This arrangement progressed to the point where Lane began leaving M.M.G. with Armstrongs for weeks at a time until M.M.G. lived primarily with Armstrongs.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-5\">\u00b66 When M.M.G. was four, Lane informed Armstrongs that she was no longer interested in parenting M.M.G. Lane left M.M.G. with Armstrongs. Armstrongs enrolled M.M.G. in school in Roundup and in associated extracurricular activities. Armstrongs cared for M.M.G. as they would a child of their own. Lane visited M.M.G. a few times a year for the next six years. In 2011, when M.M.G. was ten years old, Lane took M.M.G. for a weekend visit. Lane called Armstrongs to inform them that she was moving to Wyoming with M.M.G.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-6\">\u00b67 Armstrongs filed a petition for a parenting plan. The District Court initially granted an interim parenting plan that provided that M.M.G. would continue to live with Armstrongs. The District Court reversed course, however, when Lane objected. The District Court concluded that Armstrongs could not seek a parenting plan unless Lane\u2019s parental rights had been terminated. The District Court dismissed Armstrong\u2019s petition for the parenting plan for lack of jurisdiction. The court further determined that the interim parenting plan was without legal effect. Armstrongs appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-7\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b414-8\">\u00b68 We review de novo a district court\u2019s determination regarding its subject matter jurisdiction. <em>BNSF Ry. Co. v. Cringle, </em>2010 MT 290, \u00b6 11, 359 Mont. 20, 247 P.3d 706.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-9\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b414-10\">\n<em>\u00b6 9 Whether the District Court possessedjurisdiction to grant parental rights to Armstrongs even though the natural mother\u2019s parental rights have not been terminated.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b414-11\">\u00b610  The District Court declined to apply the nonparental statutes because Armstrongs proposed a parenting plan that places M.M.G. almost exclusively with Armstrongs, rather than merely allowing Armstrongs to visit M.M.G. We deemed this distinction important in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number><em>In re Parenting of J.N.P. v. Knopp, </em>2001 MT 120, \u00b6 6, 305 Mont. 351, 27 P.3d 953. Knopps had not established a child-parent relationship, however, so they were able to seek only visitation. Here Armstrongs seek to prove that they have established a child-parent relationship. The nonparental statutes place no restrictions on the type of parenting plans that a nonparent may seek after the nonparent has established a child-parent relationship. The District Court must consider the proposed parenting plan based on the best interests of the child. Section 40-4-228(2), MCA. In rare cases, the best interests of the child may result in a child living primarily with a third-party nonparent. \u00b611 The District Court dismissed Armstrongs\u2019 petition for lack of jurisdiction because M.M.G.\u2019s natural parents\u2019 parental rights had not been terminated. The District Court relied on <em>J.N.P. </em>to support its dismissal of Armstrongs\u2019 petition. A third party petitioned for a parenting plan in <em>J.N.P. </em>after a child had lived with them for two months. The natural mother had intended to leave temporarily the child with the Knopps, her aunt and uncle, while she found a place to live and employment in a new city. We agreed with the district court that it could not adopt Knopps\u2019 parenting plan under these circumstances unless the natural mother\u2019s parental rights had been terminated. <em>J.N.P., </em>\u00b6 25. Knopps had not established a child-parent relationship with J.N.P. As a result, the Knopps were not able to seek a parenting plan pursuant to the nonparent statutes set forth in \u00a7 40-4-228, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-4\">\u00b612  If Armstrongs can demonstrate that they have established a child-parent relationship with M.M.G., the District Court will have jurisdiction to consider whether to grant Armstrongs a parental interest in M.M.G. Section 40-4-211(4)(b), MCA. To establish a child-parent relationship, Armstrongs first must show that they provided for the physical needs of M.M.G. by supplying food, shelter, and clothing. Armstrongs also must demonstrate that they provided M.M.G. with necessary care, education, and discipline. Section 40-4-211(6)(a), MCA. Armstrongs must then establish that their relationship with M.M.G. existed on a day-to-day basis through interaction, companionship, interplay, and mutuality that fulfilled M.M.G.\u2019s psychological needs for a parent as well as M.M.G.\u2019s physical needs. Section 40-4-2ll(6)(b), MCA. And finally, Armstrongs must demonstrate that they met M.M.G.\u2019s need for continuity of care by providing permanency or stability in residence, schooling, and activities outside of the home. Section 40-4-2 ll(6)(c), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-5\">\u00b613 Armstrongs\u2019 petition asserts facts that, taken as true, could establish a child-parent relationship. Armstrongs cared for M.M.G. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>nearly fall-time from 2004 to 2011. Armstrongs provided M.M.G. with food, shelter, clothing, and a stable home. Armstrongs enrolled M.M.G. in school. They have helped M.M.G. with homework, have attended her parent teacher conferences, and her school plays. Proof of these factual allegations could demonstrate that Armstrongs have established a child-parent relationship with M.M.G. Section 40-4-211(6), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-4\">\u00b614 If Armstrongs can persuade the District Court that they have established a child-parent relationship with M.M.G., the District Court will have jurisdiction to hear their petition for a parenting plan. Section 40-4-211(4), MCA. The District Court may then award Armstrongs a parental interest if Armstrongs can show that M.M.G.\u2019s natural parents acted contrary to their child-parent relationship with M.M.G., and that it would be in the best interests of M.M.G. to continue her child-parent relationship with Armstrongs. Section 40-4-228, MCA. Armstrongs must present clear and convincing evidence that Lane and M.M.G.\u2019s natural father, Michael Gruman, engaged in conduct contrary to the child-parent relationship. Section 40-4-228(2)(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b416-5\">\u00b615 This Court twice has determined that a parent acted contrary to her child-parent relationship when the parent ceded her exclusive parenting authority to a nonparent by allowing the nonparent to help raise the children. <em>Kulstad v. Maniaci, </em>2009 MT 326, 352 Mont. 513, 220 P.3d <em>595; Filpula v. Ankney, </em>2009 MT 363, 353 Mont. 220, 220 P.3d 391. The nonparent in each case functioned in a parental role with her same sex partner for an extended period. We declined in <em>Kulstad </em>to allow the adoptive parent to \u201crewrite the history\u201d of the fact that she and her partner had lived together for more than ten years and jointly had raised the children in the household. <em>Kulstad, </em>\u00b6 78. The District Court in <em>Filpula </em>did not abuse its discretion in finding the natural parent\u2019s conduct in allowing her partner \u201cto act as a parent to these children\u201d constituted action \u201ccontrary to the child-parent relationship.\u201d <em>Filpula, </em>\u00b6 22. More recently in <em>Grice v. Price, </em>2011 MT 50, 359 Mont. 386, 251 P.3d 127, we rejected the natural father\u2019s claim that missed visitations and failure to pay child support did not constitute conduct contrary to the child-parent relationship. <em>Grice, </em>\u00b6 18.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-6\">\u00b616  Armstrongs farther must establish by clear and convincing evidence that it would be in M.M.G.\u2019s best interest to continue the child-parent relationship that they have developed. Section 40-4-228(2)(b), MCA. Nothing in the Montana nonparental statutes require Lane and Gruman be found unfit before a court may award a parental interest to Armstrongs. Section 40-4-228(5), MCA; <em>Kulstad, </em>\u00b6 75. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>nonparental statutes recognize that a parent possesses a constitutional right to raise her child. This standard further recognizes, however, that the parent may forfeit that exclusive right when the parent acts contrary to the child-parent relationship. Section 40-4-228(2)(a), MCA. Montana law considers the best interests of the child when a parent has acted contrary to her child-parent relationship. Section 40-4-227(2)(b), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-4\">\u00b617  We remand to the District Court to conduct a hearing in accordance with \u00a7 40-4-228, MCA, to determine whether Armstrongs have established a child-parent relationship with M.M.G. A determination by the District Court that Armstrongs have established a child-parent relationship with M.M.G. would allow the District Court to decide whether to grant Armstrongs a parental interest, and to consider Armstrongs\u2019 proposed parenting plan. Section 40-4-211(4)(b), MCA. In order to grant Armstrongs a parental interest, the District Court must determine that M.M.G.\u2019s natural parents acted contrary to their child-parent relationship with M.M.G. Section 40-4-228(2)(a), MCA. The court further must evaluate whether a decision to continue M.M.G.\u2019s child-parent relationship with Armstrongs would be in M.M.G.\u2019s best interest. Section 40-4-228(2)(b), MCA. We further determine that the District Court\u2019s August 25, 2011 \u201cEx Parte Order Adopting Joint Petitioner\u2019s Proposed Parenting Plan\u201d and the October 31, 2011 \u201cOrder Reinstating Interim Parenting Plan Pending Further Proceedings\u201d should be reinstated immediately pending the outcome of these proceedings.</p>\n<judges id=\"b417-5\">JUSTICES BAKER, COTTER, NELSON and WHEAT concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
