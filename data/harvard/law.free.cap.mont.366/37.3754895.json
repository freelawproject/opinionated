Wing argued at trial that he had not been driving on the day of his arrest, and that another man, Michael Halverson, had been the driver before the vehicle was disabled. We consider the following issue dispositive of this appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b64-4\">\u00b62 <em>Did the District Court abuse its discretion by preventing a defense witness from testifying, pursuant to M. R. Evid. 804(b)(3), about a statement against interest made by Halverson?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b64-5\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b64-6\">\u00b63 On October 31, 2010, the Valley County Sheriffs Department responded to a report of a disabled vehicle near the intersection of Highway 2 and Vandalia Road, between Hinsdale and Glasgow, Montana. Upon arrival, the deputy observed Wing exit from the driver side of a 1998 Chevy Malibu with a flat tire. Halverson was seated in the front passenger seat of the car, and several beer containers-some empty, and some unopened-were visible in the back seat. A registration check revealed that the car was owned by Wing\u2019s mother, Helen. Both men appeared to be highly intoxicated, and both were on probation with \u201cno alcohol\u201d restrictions as conditions of their probation.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-7\">\u00b64 The rim of the wheel with the flat tire was damaged, apparently from continued driving on the flat tire, and the car had sustained a large amount of body damage. Wing told the deputy that they had tried to flag down help to the west of the present location, but gave up and then drove on. The deputy asked Wing if he had just driven as far as he could with a flat tire, and Wing responded, \u201cYeah, um yeah, so I could get off the road <em>...\u201d </em>Wing agreed to other assertions the deputy made, but did not expressly indicate that he had been driving.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-8\">\u00b65 Wing, who was having difficulty maintaining his balance, explained to the deputy that he and Halverson had been waiting in the car for about an hour. He also offered that he had \u201cslammed\u201d three beers during this hour of waiting. He subsequently failed a series of field sobriety tests and was placed under arrest. He then began repeatedly protesting that he had not been driving. At this time, Halverson exited the vehicle and stated that Wing had not been driving. \u00b66 Despite having already placed Wing under arrest, the deputy asked for clarification as to who had been driving. Halverson\u2019s answer is unclear in the deputy\u2019s video recording, but the deputy\u2019s response to Halverson\u2019s inaudible answer was, \u201cHe wasn\u2019t? Were you?\u201d The deputy directly asked Halverson if he had been driving, but Halverson declined to answer. The deputy then administered an initial breath test to Halverson. The test revealed a blood-alcohol content of .228. Halverson was also placed under arrest \u2014 for suspected violation of the conditions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>of probation.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-4\">\u00b67 At trial in the District Court, the sole issue was whether Wing had been in \u201cactual physical control\u201d of the vehicle. Halverson was called as a defense witness, but he invoked his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination and refused to testify. Wing\u2019s mother, Helen, testified that she had loaned her vehicle to Halverson so that he could go home and feed his cats, and that Wing had been in the passenger seat when the duo drove away. Wing\u2019s counsel attempted to elicit testimony regarding a statement by Halverson to Helen that he was the driver of the car that night. The District Court sustained the prosecution\u2019s hearsay objection and disallowed the testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-5\">\u00b68 Wing testified that he had not driven the car that evening. He explained that after the car had become disabled, Halverson had gotten out to check the trunk for a spare tire. Wing testified that he entered the driver side of the car to look for Halverson\u2019s cell phone under the seat, and that while he was doing so, Halverson seated himself in the passenger seat after failing to locate the spare tire.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-6\">\u00b69 The deputy testified that he retrieved the car keys \u201cbetween the driver\u2019s side and passenger side on the floorboards.\u201d Wing contested this issue at trial, alleging that the police video shows the deputy leaning \u201conly slightly into the passenger side door\u201d to retrieve the keys. The prosecution\u2019s video index, which had not been disclosed prior to trial, also contained the heading \u201cfound keys on passenger side.\u201d Wing moved to dismiss on this basis, arguing that the prosecution had withheld material evidence. The District Court denied the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-7\">\u00b6 10 Wing was convicted and sentenced to eight years in prison. He now appeals from his conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-8\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b65-9\">\u00b611 This Court reviews a district court\u2019s rulings on admissibility of evidence for abuse of discretion. <em>State v. Jenkins, </em>2011 MT 287, \u00b6 4,362 Mont. 481, 265 P.3d 643. Where the rationale for excluding evidence is based on the interpretation of an evidentiary rule or statute, our review is de novo. <em>State v. Dist. Ct. of the Eighteenth Jud. Dist., </em>2010 MT 263, \u00b6 31, 358 Mont. 325, 246 P.3d 415.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-10\">ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b65-11\">\u00b612 Wing claims that Halverson admitted to \u201cothers out of court, including Helen Wing, that he, not Robert Wing, had been the driver of the vehicle on the night in question.\u201d He claims that the District Court erred by excluding testimony regarding Halverson\u2019s statement to Helen.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>\u00b613 <em>Did the District Court abuse its discretion by preventing a defense witness from testifying, pursuant to M. R. Evid. 804(b)(3), about a statement against interest made by Halverson?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b66-4\">\u00b614 \u201cHearsay is a statement, other than one made by the declarant while testifying at the trial or hearing, offered in evidence to prove the truth of the matter asserted.\u201d M. R. Evid. 801(c). Under the foundational policy of requiring that testimony be given by witnesses in open court, under oath, and subject to cross-examination, hearsay is not admissible into evidence. 2 <em>McCormick on Evidence </em>\u00a7 245 (Kenneth S. Broun ed., 6th ed., Thomson/West 2006). There are, of course, exceptions when there are independent indications of the reliability or trustworthiness of the out-of-court statement. Among other exceptions to the hearsay rule, M. R. Evid. 804 addresses situations in which the declarant is unavailable to testify as a witness. The relevant exception in this case is the \u201cstatement against interest.\u201d A statement by an unavailable witness is not excluded from evidence when it is:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b66-5\">[a] statement which was at the time of its making so far contrary to the declarant\u2019s pecuniary or proprietary interest, or so far tended to subject the declarant to civil or criminal liability, or to render invalid a claim by the declarant against another or to make the declarant an object of hatred, ridicule, or disgrace, that a reasonable person in the declarant\u2019s position would not have made the statement unless the declarant believed it to be true. A statement tending to expose the declarant to criminal liability and offered to exculpate the accused is not admissible unless corroborating circumstances clearly indicate the trustworthiness of the statement.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b66-6\">M. R. Evid. 804(b)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b66-7\">\u00b615 Accordingly, to be admissible under M. R. Evid. 804(b)(3), Halverson\u2019s alleged statement against interest must meet three tests: (1) Halverson must be unavailable as a witness; (2) the statement must so far tend to subject Halverson to civil or criminal liability that a reasonable person in his position would not have made the statement unless he believed it to be true; and (3) because it was offered to exculpate Wing, the statement must be corroborated by circumstances clearly indicating its trustworthiness.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-8\">\u00b616 Admission of hearsay evidence under M. R. Evid. 804 first requires a determination that the declarant is \u201cunavailable.\u201d <em>State v. Stuit, </em>277 Mont. 227, 231, 921 P.2d 866, 869 (1996). M. R. Evid. 804(a)(1) provides that a declarant is unavailable as a witness if exempted from testifying concerning the subject matter of his or her statement by ruling of the court on the ground of privilege.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>\u00b617 Halverson was called to the witness stand and directly asked whether he was driving on the night in question. He answered, \u201cI refuse ... and assert my right under the Fifth Amendment against self incrimination, and, therefore decline to answer that question.\u201d He was then excused by the District Court. The State acknowledges that, once Halverson\u2019s claim of privilege had been sustained, he was \u201cunavailable\u201d within the meaning of M. R. Evid. 804(a)(1). <em>Cf. State v. Fina, </em>273 Mont. 171, 183-184, 902 P.2d 30, 38 (1995). Accordingly, our inquiry turns to whether his statement would tend to subject him to criminal liability to an extent that a reasonable person would not have made it unless he believed it was true.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-4\">\u00b618 Wing attempted at trial to introduce testimony from his mother, Helen, regarding the alleged statement made to her by Halverson, in which Halverson admitted to being the driver on the night in question:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A1qJ\">DEFENSE COUNSEL: Did you talk to Mr. Halverson about how your car got off the highway and on Vandalia road turnoff?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AS\">HELEN: Yeah. He said he had-</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AA\">PROSECUTION: Objection, hearsay, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b67-5\">THE COURT: The objection is sustained as to what Mr. Halverson may say. The answer, though, called for is just a yes or no response, so I\u2019ll have the question read back to you. [Court reporter read back original question.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b67-6\">HELEN: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b67-7\">DEFENSE COUNSEL: Did he admit to you that he was the driver?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b67-8\">PROSECUTION: Objection, hearsay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b67-9\">DEFENSE COUNSEL: Statement against interest.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b67-10\">HELEN: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b67-11\">THE COURT: Just a. moment. Do not respond. The objection\u2019s sustained. If there was any response it must be stricken from the record. I will advise the jury that you may not consider that response in your deliberations. Go ahead, Mr. Piocos.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b67-12\">DEFENSE COUNSEL: Did Mr. Halverson tell you that he was driving drunk on October 31st, 2010?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b67-13\">PROSECUTION: Objection, hearsay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b67-14\">THE COURT: Sustained.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b67-15\">DEFENSE COUNSEL: I have nothing further, your Honor.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b67-16\">Wing argues that the statement he sought to introduce constituted a statement against interest under M. R. Evid. 804(b)(3), and should not have been excluded.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-17\">\u00b619 The underlying logic in providing a hearsay exception to statements against interest is that such statements \u201chave as their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>circumstantial guaranties of trustworthiness the fact that persons generally do not make statements against their interest unless those statements are true.\u201d <em>State v. La Pier, </em>208 Mont. 106, 110, 676 P.2d 210, 212 (1984). One factor that influences this analysis is whether the statement solidly inculpates the declarant in an offense. <em>See e.g. United States v. Nazemian, </em>948 F.2d 522, 530 (9th Cir. 1991). \u201c[T]he very fact that a statement is genuinely self-inculpatory ... is itself one of the \u2018particularized guarantees of trustworthiness\u2019 that makes a statement admissible under the Confrontation Clause.\u201d <em>Williamson v. United States, </em>512 U.S. 594, 605, 114 S. Ct. 2431, 2437 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b68-4\">\u00b620 The information collected during the initial roadside investigation was likely sufficient to establish that Halverson was intoxicated, a violation of his probation. Accordingly, further evidence that he had been the driver not only tended to subject him to a revocation, but to additional criminal liability for the DUI and a much higher potential sentence. It also could possibly lead to civil liability for any damages to the car. Rather than simply having probative value in a trial against him, Halverson\u2019s alleged statement is a confession and clearly against his own interest. Taken together with the evidence established at the time of Wing\u2019s arrest, we conclude that Halverson\u2019s alleged statement likely would not have been made by a reasonable person in his position unless he believed it to be true.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-5\">\u00b621 This Court has had scant previous opportunity to interpret \u201ccorroborated by] circumstances clearly indicating] ... the trustworthiness of the statement\u201d within the meaning of M. R. Evid. 804(b)(3). In <em>La Pier, </em>208 Mont. at 111, 676 P.2d at 213, we held that this Court \u201cwill ordinarily defer to the discretion of the District Court on matters of admission of evidence, particularly where the court is determining circumstantial guaranties of trustworthiness, unless an abuse of discretion is clearly shown.\u201d Because the District Court provided no justification for its ruling in the present case, we will look to the record to adduce any corroboration for Halverson\u2019s statement. \u00b622 The State cites to <em>State v. Powers, </em>233 Mont. 54, 57-58, 758 P.2d 761, 762-763 (1988), forthe proposition that an uncorroborated hearsay statement is properly excluded when it is made by one defendant, indicating that the codefendant was not involved in the offense. The State also points to Halverson initially lying to the deputy about his identity and his unwillingness to state on the record that he was driving, as indications that he is untrustworthy and simply trying to obfuscate the issue to help his friend Wing. But a number of factors corroborate Halverson\u2019s statement: (1) approximately 40 minutes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>elapsed between the report to the sheriffs office of a disabled vehicle and when the officer arrived on the scene; thus, there was plenty of time for Halverson and Wing to move around; (2) the statements made by Halverson at the scene, and documented in the police video, that Wing was not driving; (3) Helen\u2019s testimony that she gave Halverson the keys and he drove the vehicle away from her home; (4) the deputy\u2019s testimony that the keys were equally available to both men within the car; and (5) the video evidence that the keys were retrieved from the passenger side of the vehicle, where Halverson had been seated. Still, the State argues that these pieces of evidence do not \u201cclearly indicate the trustworthiness of the statement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b69-4\">\u00b623 While the above factors do not conclusively establish the trustworthiness of Halverson\u2019s statement, they do corroborate the alleged statement. As such, they are indications of trustworthiness and therefore support a conclusion that, given the importance to Wing\u2019s case, Helen\u2019s testimony should have been allowed. Helen\u2019s testimony was directly pertinent to the critical issue to be decided by the jury: was Wing driving the vehicle? The State\u2019s arguments certainly call into question the evidentiary weight of the statement by Halverson, but the weight of the evidence should have been left to the jury. And because (1) Halverson was unavailable as a witness, (2) his alleged statement unquestionably could expose him to criminal liability, and (3) the alleged statement was clearly corroborated by other evidence that indicates trustworthiness, we conclude the District Court abused its discretion when it sustained the State\u2019s objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-5\">\u00b624  While trial courts have the obligation to determine indications of trustworthiness, those considerations must be made in the context of the entire proceeding and with a view toward the ultimate issue that must be decided by the jury. Halverson\u2019s alleged statement against interest should have been admitted pursuant to M. R. Evid. 804(b)(3), and the jury should have been given the opportunity to weigh all the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-6\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b69-7\">\u00b625 Based on the foregoing, we reverse the District Court\u2019s judgment and remand for further proceedings consistent with this Opinion.</p>\n<judges id=\"b69-8\">JUSTICES NELSON, BAKER, COTTER, WHEAT, MORRIS and RICE concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
