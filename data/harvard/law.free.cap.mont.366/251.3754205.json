(\u201cSomont\u201d) appeals the Ninth Judicial District Court\u2019s decision affirming the Board of Labor Appeals\u2019 (\u201cBOLA\u201d or \u201cthe Board\u201d) award of unemployment benefits to Doreen L. Kang. The only issue on appeal is whether the Board correctly concluded that Somont failed to show misconduct, as defined in Admin. R. Mont. 24.11.460 and 24.11.461. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-5\">PROCEDURAL AND FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b278-6\">\u00b62 Somont operates an oil and natural gas production office near Shelby, Montana. On July 28, 2008, the company hired King as an office manager. In the summer of 2009, Somont sought to hire an operations manager, who would replace the current vice president of operations, Curt Dahlgaard, when he retired. Joseph Alborano applied for the position. King facilitated a background check on Alborano, which revealed some negative credit history, but no criminal record. After discussing the background report with Alborano and contacting his references, Somont\u2019s president, Charles Jansky, chose Alborano for the position. Jansky introduced Alborano to Somont\u2019s employees, then met with the company\u2019s managers to gather their impressions. King expressed concerns based on Alborano\u2019s credit history and rumors that he had a violent background and family issues. Asked for examples, she provided none, although the hearing officer found that Alborano had a twenty-two-year-old restraining order that had not yet been removed.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-7\">\u00b63 When Dahlgaard took planned vacation in late August 2009, Jansky was inclined to place Alborano temporarily in charge and held another meeting with the managers for input on his decision. King expressed concern about Alborano\u2019s tendency to talk about his financial situation. Jansky found this complaint unrelated to Alborano\u2019s ability to perform his duties and placed Alborano temporarily in charge of operations.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-8\">\u00b64 On November 23, 2009, King received a performance evaluation which indicated that she met and exceeded Somont\u2019s expectations and that Somont was giving her a pay raise. About two months later, in January 2010, King raised additional concerns about Alborano to fellow employees and company officials, which resulted in Somont\u2019s eventual decision to terminate her employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-9\">\u00b65 On January 22, 2010, King told Somont\u2019s receptionist, Lorrie Housel, that Alborano \u201chad a violent felony history resulting in a restraining order, threw temper tantrums, got red in the face, chewed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>his hands, ate earwax, threatened to snap her like a twig, and was abusive to his family.\u201d At first, Housel believed King and agreed that Alborano exhibited threatening conduct. She told King that Alborano had hurt her by shaking her hand too hard and by pressing on her shoulder when she had a migraine. King solicited Housel\u2019s support when she drafted a letter that she intended to read to Alborano, stating that she and Housel did not want to be subjected to his derogatory and intimidating behavior. King also called Dahlgaard to inform him of the letter and to tell him that she and Housel feared for their safety due to Alborano\u2019s behavior. Dahlgaard immediately contacted Somont\u2019s attorney, Don Lee, who met with King and Housel on January 25, 2010. Lee then called Jansky and suggested that he perform an investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-4\">\u00b66 On January 26, 2010, Jansky and Somont\u2019s human resource manager, Christine Taveira, flew from Texas to Montana to investigate the allegations regarding Alborano. Jansky, Taveira and Lee interviewed King and Housel, this time separately. Evidence was presented that, during the meeting with Housel, King sent Housel a series of text messages asking her to leave the meeting, but that Housel ignored the messages. During the interview, Housel withdrew her complaints and stated that she did not actually feel threatened by Alborano. Jansky and Taveira then interviewed Alborano, who denied King\u2019s statements and explained that the alleged threat of snapping King like a twig was a joke made with reference to a movie. Jansky and Taveira believed Alborano and, on January 27, 2010, Jansky discharged King. He stated that Somont had concluded that her allegations were not supported by substantial credible evidence and many of them were patently false, resulting in Somont\u2019s inability to have faith in her judgment and credibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-5\">\u00b67 King applied to the Department of Labor and Industry Unemployment Insurance Division (\u201cUID\u201d) for unemployment benefits. On June 7,2010, an UID claims adjudicator determined that King had not been discharged for misconduct because intentional disregard of her obligation to Somont had not been established. Somont requested re-determination and, on July 14, 2010, a second UID adjudicator concluded that there was no evidence to justify changing the decision. Somont appealed to the Department of Labor and Industry Hearings Bureau. On August 10, 2010, following an evidentiary hearing in which King appeared telephonically without counsel, the hearing officer reversed, finding that King\u2019s statements were \u201cnot an error in judgment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b280-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>\u00b68 King appealed to BOLA. The Board held a hearing on October 6, 2010, at which King and Somont were present and represented by counsel. On October 15, 2010, the Board reversed the hearing officer\u2019s decision, concluding that King\u2019s conduct \u201cat best was a good faith error in judgment.\u201d The Board\u2019s written decision discussed King\u2019s positive employment history and stated that Somont had presented insufficient evidence to meet its burden in proving \u201c\u2018willful or wanton\u2019 or deliberate disregard for the interests of the employer, or carelessness or negligence of such degree to show an intentional/substantial disregard for the employer\u2019s interest\u201d under Admin. R. M. 24.11.460(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b280-4\">\u00b69 The District Court dismissed Somont\u2019s petition for review. The court indicated that Somont\u2019s argument on appeal would require an impermissible re-weighing of the evidence. \u201cWhile there may very well be evidence to support Somont\u2019s decision to terminate,\u201d the court found substantial evidence to support BOLA\u2019s determination that Somont had not shown misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-5\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b280-6\">\u00b610 Whether an employee has \u201cdisregarded standards of behavior, been careless or negligent, or violated company rules\u201d are factual questions, which we review for substantial evidence. <em>Hafner v. Mont. Dep\u2019t of Labor, </em>280 Mont. 95, 99-100, 929 P.2d 233, 236 (1996) (citing \u00a7 39-51-2410(5), MCA). If supported by substantial evidence, BOLA\u2019s findings of fact are conclusive, even if a preponderance of the evidence weighs to the contrary. <em>Johnson v. W. Transport, LLC, </em>2011 MT 13, \u00b6 17, 359 Mont. 145, 247 P.3d 1094 (internal citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b280-7\">\u00b611 Whether those facts demonstrate \u201cmisconduct\u201d requires \u201cinterpretation and application of the Administrative Rules of Montana and is a legal conclusion reviewable by this Court.\u201d <em>Hafner, </em>280 Mont. at 100, 929 P.3d at 236. We review an agency\u2019s conclusion of law to determine if the agency\u2019s interpretation of the law is correct. <em>Steer, Inc. v. Dep\u2019t of Revenue, </em>245 Mont. 470, 474, 803 P.2d 601, 603 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b280-8\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b280-9\">\u00b612 In a judicial proceeding to review BOLA\u2019s determination of a claim for unemployment benefits, \u201cthe findings of the board as to the facts, if supported by evidence and in the absence of fraud, shall be conclusive and jurisdiction of [the] court shall be confined to questions of law.\u201d Section 39-51-2410(5), MCA. According to Somont, BOLA did not make any of its own factual findings when it reversed the hearing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>officer\u2019s decision, \u201cnor did it state that the hearing officer\u2019s findings of fact were insufficient, inaccurate, or not supported by the record.\u201d Somont contends that BOLA thus adopted the hearing officer\u2019s factual findings, and incorrectly reversed her conclusion that misconduct was shown. King argues that Somont simply asks the Court to re-weigh the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-4\">\u00b613 In deciding whether BOLA\u2019s legal conclusions are correct, we review the record of all prior proceedings. <em>See Mont. Dep\u2019t of Corrections v. State Dep\u2019t of Labor &amp; Industry, </em>2006 MT 298, \u00b6 24, 334 Mont. 425, 148 P.3d 619 (providing that judicial review of a BOLA decision involves consideration of the \u201centire record\u201d). Having reviewed the record, we disagree with Somont\u2019s contention. The Board\u2019s written decision states that \u201cthe hearing officer\u2019s findings are in error,\u201d and the transcript of its hearing on the matter indicates that the Board found insufficient proof that King intended to deceive her employer or substantially disregarded Somont\u2019s interests.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-5\">\u00b614 The administrative rule applicable in this case, which since has been repealed, defined \u201cmisconduct\u201d for purposes of eligibility for unemployment benefits under \u00a7 39-51-2303, MCA. Admin. R. M. 24.11.460 (repealed 2012 MAR p. 1040 (5/25/12)). The rule provided a list of findings, any one of which would constitute misconduct, then provided a list of findings that, standing alone, would fail to demonstrate misconduct. It stated in full as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b281-6\">24.11.460 DISQUALIFICATION FOR MISCONDUCT</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b281-7\">(1) Misconduct as used in 39-51-2303, MCA, includes, but is not limited to, the following conduct by a claimant:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b281-8\">(a) willful or wanton disregard of the rights, title, and interests of a fellow employee or the employer;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b281-9\">(b) deliberate violations or disregard of standards of behavior which the employer has the right to expect of an employee;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b281-10\">(c) carelessness or negligence that causes or would likely cause serious bodily harm to the employer or fellow employee; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b281-11\">(d) carelessness or negligence of such degree or recurrence to show an intentional or substantial disregard of the employer\u2019s interest.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b281-12\">(2) The term misconduct does not necessarily include:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b281-13\">(a) inefficiency, unsatisfactory conduct, or failure to perform well as the result of inability or incapacity;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b281-14\">(b) inadvertence or ordinary negligence in isolated instances; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b281-15\">(c) good faith errors in judgment or discretion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b281-16\">Additionally, Admin. R. M. 24.11.461 enumerates specific acts that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>constitute misconduct because they \u201csignify a willful and wanton disregard for the rights, title, and interests of the employer or a fellow employee.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b282-4\">\u00b615 In its August 10, 2010 decision, the hearing officer determined that Somont had shown King\u2019s behavior to be intentional under Admin. R. M. 24.11.460(l)(a)-(b), rather than an error in judgment, and thus concluded that Somont had proven misconduct. This determination was supported by the hearing officer\u2019s finding that King intended to have Alborano fired. The hearing officer stated specifically:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A5f\">King argues that she never intended to have Alborano fired but just wanted some type of resolution. It is inconceivable the employer would consider continuing Alborano\u2019s employment if it found any of the accusations of threatening and bizarre behavior to be true. King\u2019s actions were not an error in judgment. The claimant\u2019s accusations, if found to be true, would have resulted in the immediate termination of Alborano.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b282-5\">\u00b616 When BOLA reversed that decision in its written opinion, it determined that these findings were in error and provided reasons, albeit limited ones, for disagreeing with the hearing officer:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b282-6\">In this case, the Board majority finds that there is insufficient evidence that King\u2019s actions were \u2018willful or wanton\u2019 or [in] deliberate disregard for the interests of the employer, or carelessness or negligence of such degree to show an intentional/substantial disregard of the employer\u2019s interest. The Board majority finds that King was a long-time employee with little to no history of poor performance and her actions in this matter at best w[ere] a good faith error in judgment. Therefore, the Board majority finds that the employer failed to meet its burden and establish with substantial, credible evidence that King\u2019s discharge was for misconduct.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b282-7\">The transcript of the BOLA hearing includes questioning by members of the Board and discussion by counsel for both parties as to each of the relevant criteria under Admin. R. M. 24.11.460 and Admin. R. M. 24.11.461. At that time, Somont argued that King\u2019s conduct was willful, wanton and in substantial disregard of Somont\u2019s interests and expected standards of conduct, thus constituting misconduct under Admin R. M. 24.11.460(l)(a), (b), or (d) and Admin. R. M. 24.11.461. King argued that her conduct was at most isolated negligence or a good faith error in judgment under Admin. R. M. 24.11.460(2)(b) or (c), and therefore did not rise to misconduct. The Board considered these arguments and concluded that Somont had failed to prove King\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>conduct was willful, wanton, or in substantial disregard of Somont\u2019s interests.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-4\">\u00b617 While the Board\u2019s written opinion only referred to King\u2019s positive employment history, the hearing transcript reveals that the BOLA majority was not convinced that King was being deceitful when she claimed that Alborano\u2019s comments had affected her:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b283-5\">BOLAND: I\u2019ve reviewed as, as [have] my colleagues[,] the record and listened to testimony. I don\u2019t, I guess I don\u2019t see where misconduct is part of this. I think it\u2019s interesting that Mr. Alborano\u2019s comments are dismissed as a joke or a-I can see how that would affect Miss King. I would make a motion to reverse the hearing officer\u2019s decision.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b283-6\">CALHOUN: I\u2019m going to second that based primarily on my evaluation of what happened just before she was terminated. Namely the, the performance review that she got which was, was good. I, I think if anything was amiss it was her, her negligence, at most. So I second the motion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b283-7\">The discussion helps to clarify the Board\u2019s basis for reversing the hearing officer\u2019s factual findings; namely, in light of conflicting evidence as to King\u2019s intent, Somont had not met its burden in proving misconduct as defined by Admin. R. M. 24.11.460 and Admin. R. M. 24.11.461.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-8\">\u00b618 We apply a deferential standard of review to an agency\u2019s interpretation in matters of its expertise. <em>See Gypsy Highview Gathering Sys., Inc. v. Stokes, </em>221 Mont. 11, 16, 716 P.2d 620, 623 (1986) (deferring to BOLA\u2019s conclusion as to unsafe working conditions because \u201c[t]he Board, with its expertise in the area, is in the better position to determine what is and is not safe\u201d). In determining eligibility for unemployment benefits, BOLA has considerable expertise in deciding what constitutes \u201cwillful or wanton disregard of the rights, title and interests of a fellow employee or employer\u201d and \u201ccarelessness or negligence of such degree or recurrence to show an intentional or substantial disregard for the employer\u2019s interest.\u201d Admin. R. M. 24.11.460(l)(a)-(b). Here, the Board reasonably concluded that these findings, as made by the hearing officer, were not supported by the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-9\">\u00b6 19 When reviewing a final agency decision, we have often stated that substantial evidence requires \u201cmore than a scintilla of evidence, but less than a preponderance of the evidence.\u201d <em>See e.g. Johnson, </em>\u00b6 17 (citing <em>American Agrijusters Co. v. Mont. Dep\u2019t of Labor and Indus., </em>1999 MT 241, \u00b6 15, 296 Mont. 176, 988 P.2d 782). Applying this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>standard, we have reversed BOLA\u2019s findings of fact when they were plainly not supported by the record or where the Board failed to review the record in making its decision. <em>See e.g. Moody v. Northland Royalty Co., </em>281 Mont. 26, 31, 930 P.2d 1100, 1103 (1997) (reversing BOLA\u2019s decision where BOLA found that the employee made a false statement, but there was \u201cno indication in the record\u201d that the statement was false); Mont. <em>Dep\u2019t of Corrections, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 19-21 (reversing BOLA\u2019s decision where BOLA reversed the hearing officer without reviewing the record to determine whether there was substantial evidence to support a finding of willful disregard of the employer\u2019s interest). Here, BOLA\u2019s decision was based on its review of the record, as well as its independent questioning of counsel for both parties during the hearing, and it provided reasons for reversing the hearing officer\u2019s findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-4\">\u00b620 Somont contends that King willfully disregarded Somont\u2019s interests by \u201csharing her misinformation with Housel,\u201d when she could instead have \u201cquietly notified Somont of her concerns, [so that] an investigation could have quickly been launched without the drama and chaos that resulted ....\u201d While King may have used poor judgment, BOLA\u2019s determination is appropriate when compared to cases where an employee was held to have acted with willful or wanton disregard ofthe employer\u2019s interests. <em>See Hafner, </em>280 Mont. at 100-101, 929 P.2d at 237 (employee violated the \u201cethical rules of a Right-of-Way agent\u201d and a company policy of which he was aware); <em>see also Mont. Dep\u2019t of Corrections, </em>\u00b6 23 (employee violated a rule written in the personnel manual which was a \u201creasonable company rule that [he] was aware of\u2019); <em>see also Fed. Aviation Administration v. Mont. State Dep\u2019t of Labor &amp; Indus., </em>212 Mont. 1, 7, 685 P.2d 365, 368 (1984) (employees violated federal law by participating in a strike). Somont did not prove that King\u2019s conduct violated an ethical rule, an explicit direction or policy of the company, or the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-5\">\u00b621 Judicial review of BOLA\u2019s decision should not involve reconsideration of the evidence, as the District Court aptly noted in this case. <em>Johnson, </em>\u00b6 18 (\u201cThe reviewing court must decide whether substantial evidence supports the [Board]\u2019s findings and not whether, on the same evidence, it would have arrived at the same conclusion.\u201d); <em>Gypsy Highway, </em>221 Mont. at 15, 716 P.2d at 623 (\u201c[I]t is not our job to weigh conflicting evidence presented to the Board.\u201d). Here, BOLA determined that the hearing officer\u2019s finding of intentional conduct lacked substantial evidence. It found that King\u2019s behavior amounted to isolated negligence, at most, rather than deliberate deception. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>Board cited evidence in its written opinion and during its hearing to support this determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-4\">\u00b622  The facts reasonably may be interpreted to support BOLA\u2019s legal conclusion. While Somont may have had good reason to determine that King\u2019s unsatisfactory conduct justified termination, evidence supports the Board\u2019s decision that King\u2019s dislike of Alborano and her sharing of misinformation within the workplace did not amount to substantial disregard of Somont\u2019s interests or deliberate refusal to follow company directives. Like the District Court, we need not determine whether this Court would reach the same conclusion on the evidence presented. <em>Johnson, </em>\u00b6 18. Because BOLA\u2019s factual findings were supported by substantial evidence, its legal conclusion that misconduct had not been shown under Admin. R. M. 24.11.460 and Admin R. M. 24.11.461 was correct. <em>Hafner, </em>280 Mont. at 100, 929 P.2d at 236.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-5\">\u00b623 Accordingly, the judgment of the District Court is affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b285-6\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES WHEAT, COTTER and RICE concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
