C. B. McNeil (McNeil). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-24\">PROCEDURAL AND FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b361-25\">\u00b62 Hartsoe filed a civil action against McNeil, seeking damages for McNeil\u2019s acts or omissions while acting as a Montana District Court Judge and presiding over a telephone pretrial conference in a civil action <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>then pending before him, <em>Heisel v. Hartsoe, </em>No. DV-10-353, Montana Twentieth Judicial District Court. Hartsoe alleged in his complaint that he was suing Judge McNeil for actions taken \u201cin his official duty,\u201d including using vulgar language, failing to accomplish any results at the conference, and not having a reporter to record the proceeding. At all relevant times McNeil was acting in his official capacity as a Montana District Court Judge with regard to that case and the pretrial conference.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-4\">\u00b63 McNeil appeared in the present action and moved to dismiss on the grounds of judicial immunity. Hartsoe did not respond to the motion. The District Court granted the motion to dismiss, with prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-5\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b362-6\">\u00b64 This Court reviews de novo a district court\u2019s decision on a motion to dismiss. <em>Grizzly Sec. Armored Express v. The Armored Grp., </em>2011 MT 128, \u00b6 11, 360 Mont. 517, 255 P.2d 143.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b362-8\">\u00b65  Judges are immune from suit for damages arising out of the lawful discharge of their official duties. Section 2-9-112(2), MCA. Judicial immunity applies with no stated limitation, <em>Silverstone v. Park Co., </em>2007 MT 261, \u00b6 14, 339 Mont. 299, 170 P.3d 950, and judges are absolutely immune from suit for civil damages for acts performed in their judicial capacities. <em>Steele v. McGregor, </em>1998 MT 85, \u00b6 16, 288 Mont. 238, 956 P.2d 1364. Judicial immunity is a public policy designed to safeguard principles of independent decision making. <em>Mead v. McKittrick, </em>223 Mont. 428, 430, 727 P.2d 517, 519 (1984). The principles of judicial immunity are well established in the United States. <em>Stump v. Sparkman, </em>435 U. S. 349, 98 S. Ct. 1099 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b362-10\">\u00b66 Hartsoe plead in his complaint that Judge McNeil was acting \u201cin his official duty\u201d with regard to this case. The acts that Hartsoe complains of occurred while Judge McNeil was conducting a pretrial conference in a pending case. This is clearly within the authority and responsibility of a district court judge. Therefore there can be no question that Judge McNeil is immune from suit and that the District Court properly dismissed Hartsoe\u2019s complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-11\">\u00b67 Hartsoe raises numerous issues and contentions in his appeal which he did not raise below and which, in any event, do not affect the clear conclusion that Judge McNeil is entitled to judicial immunity from suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-12\">\u00b68 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b362-13\">JUSTICES COTTER, RICE, WHEAT and MORRIS concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
