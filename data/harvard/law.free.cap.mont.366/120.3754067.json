Whether the District Court erred by declaring that islands arising vertically from the bed of the Missouri River after statehood are not held by the State in trust for the financial benefit of the public schools.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b148-4\">\u00b64 <em>2.

Whether the District Court erred by denying costs to the State.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b148-7\">PROCEDURAL AND FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b148-8\">\u00b67 On July 12,2006, the State filed an action in the Seventh Judicial District Court to quiet title to three islands in the Missouri River located in Sections 4, 5, and 8, Township 26 North, Range 59 East, MPM, Richland County, Montana. The State attached to its complaint a chronological series of surveys and aerial photographs demonstrating that the islands were formed from sedimentary accretions on the riverbed. The latest aerial photograph, taken in 2005, illustrated that the lands-described as Tracts 1, 2, and 3-were no longer surrounded by water but attached to shore land. The total property at issue was approximately 487 acres. The State averred that, because the islands emerged after statehood, its title to the land was superior to that of all the defendants named in the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-9\">\u00b68 In July 2007, the State filed a request to enter the land, pursuant to M. R. Civ. P. 34, for the purpose of surveying. Nearly a year later, the State filed an amended complaint identifying the precise geographical coordinates of the land it claimed should be declared State-owned land in the quiet title action.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-10\">\u00b69 Of the numerous defendants named in the complaint, most did not file an answer and many of the defendants who did respond ultimately settled with the State. Defendants Boyd Hardy, Shirley Hardy, Hardy Investments, L.P., and Nickie Roth, (collectively \u201cDefendants\u201d) filed answers and counterclaimed that they owned portions of the land in fee simple and that the District Court should quiet title in their favor. \u00b610 On September 11, 2009, the State filed a motion for summary judgment. It asserted that the lands at issue properly were characterized as vertical accretions to a navigable river and, as such, the property belonged to the State and was held in trust for common public schools. Defendants filed a response brief and cross-motion for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>summary judgment. Defendants did not dispute that the lands constituted accretions to the riverbed and originally belonged to the State; however, they argued they had acquired rightful title to the land by adverse possession.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-3\">\u00b611 On May 5,2011, the District Court granted the State\u2019s motion for summary judgment, ruling that the State holds title to the disputed lands and that Defendants could not acquire title by adverse possession against public trust land. The court further held, however, that the riverbeds were not school trust lands. The court based its decision, in part, on this Court\u2019s statement in <em>PPL Mont., LLC v. State, </em>2010 MT 64, 355 Mont. 402, 229 P.3d 421, <em>overruled on other grounds, PPL Mont., LLC v. </em>Montana,_U.S._,_, 132 S. Ct. 1215, 1235 (2012), that \u201cthe District Court erred in concluding that the riverbeds at issue were school trust lands\u201d because, even if it had authority to do so, the Land Board had not classified them as such. <em>PPL </em>Mont., \u00b6 116. The District Court then ruled <em>sua sponte </em>that the State was required, under the doctrine of unjust enrichment, to reimburse Defendants for all property taxes and improvements made on the land. The court concluded its order by directing each party to pay its own costs and fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-6\">\u00b612 On May 18, 2011, the State filed a motion to alter or amend the court\u2019s order pursuant to M. R. Civ. P. 59(g) (2009). The State asserted the court should strike the portion requiring the State to reimburse Defendants for the property taxes and improvements made on the land as that directive was improper. The State also averred it was statutorily entitled to recover its costs for bringing the quiet title action. Defendants opposed the State\u2019s motion and the State filed a brief in reply. The court did not rule on the motion and entered judgment on December 1,2011, consistent with its earlier order. After the State\u2019s motion was deemed denied, the parties filed a stipulation, agreeing \u201cthat $8,845.00 is the value of taxes, improvements and interest as specified in the Court\u2019s May 5, 2011 Summary Judgment Order,\u201d and reserving each party\u2019s right to appeal any other issues. The State timely appealed, raising four issues for review. Defendants did not cross-appeal or file a response brief. Because the issue has not been appealed, we do not address or disturb the District Court\u2019s judgment in favor of the State on Defendants\u2019 claim of adverse possession.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-7\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b149-8\">\u00b613 We review summary judgment rulings de novo, applying the same <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>M. R. Civ. P. 56 criteria as the District Court. <em>Albert v. City of Billings, </em>2012 MT 159, \u00b6 15, 365 Mont. 454, 282 P.3d 704. Summary judgment is appropriate when there are no genuine issues of material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. <em>Albert, </em>\u00b6 15. A district court\u2019s conclusions of law are reviewed for correctness. <em>Roe Family, LLC v. Lincoln County Bd. of Comm\u2019rs, </em>2008 MT 70, \u00b6 12, 342 Mont. 108, 179 P.3d 514.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-4\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b150-5\">\u00b614 <em>1. Whether the District Court erred by declaring islands arising vertically from the bed of the Missouri River after statehood are not held by the State in trust for the financial benefit of the public schools. </em>\u00b615 Article X, Section 11(1) of the Montana Constitution provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A5\">All lands of the state that have been or may be granted by congress, or acquired by gift or grant or devise from any person or corporation, shall be public lands of the state. They shall be held in trust for the people, to be disposed of as hereafter provided, for the respective purposes for which they have been or may be granted, donated or devised.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b150-6\">Based on this language, we agreed with the district court\u2019s determination in <em>PPL Montana </em>that riverbeds were public trust lands of the State. <em>PPL Mont., </em>\u00b6 115. We rejected the court\u2019s holding \u201cthat the riverbeds were school trust lands,\u201d however, because \u201c[e]ven if the Land Board could arguably classify the riverbeds as school trust lands, the simple fact remains that it has not done so.\u201d <em>PPL Mont., </em>\u00b6 116.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-7\">\u00b6 16 On the basis of this statement in <em>PPL Montana, </em>the District Court determined that the islands in question were not held in trust for public schools. The court discussed the \u201cequal-footing doctrine\u201d as announced in <em>Pollard\u2019s Lessee v. Hagan, </em>44 U.S. 212, 11 L. Ed. 565 (1845), which held that, \u201cupon their admission to the Union, [states] acquire title to the lands underlying the navigable waters within their boundaries.\u201d <em>Oregon ex rel. State Land Bd. v. Corvallis Sand &amp; Gravel Co., </em>429 U.S. 363, 370, 97 S. Ct. 582, 586-87 (1977). The District Court reasoned that because the States succeeded to the riverbeds as sovereigns, rather than as grantees of the federal government, Article X, Section 11(1) of the Montana Constitution was inapplicable. Nevertheless, the District Court held that the land belonged to the State, not in fee simple, but as public trust property based on the doctrine articulated in <em>Illinois Cent. R. Co. v. Illinois, </em>146 U.S. 387, 13 S. Ct. 387 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b150-8\">\u00b617 Under the equal footing doctrine, \u201cthe State\u2019s title to the riverbed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>vests absolutely as of the time of its admission and is not subject to later defeasance by operation of any doctrine of federal common law.\u201d <em>Oregon ex rel. State Land Bd., </em>429 U.S. at 370-71, 97 S. Ct. at 587. In contrast, \u201cthe public trust doctrine remains a matter of state law.\u201d <em>PPL Mont., LLC v. </em>Montana,_U.S._,_, 132 S. Ct. 1215, 1235.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-4\">\u00b618 The United States Supreme Court has made this distinction clear:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A2s\">While equal footing cases have noted that the State takes title to the navigable waters and their beds in trust for the public, the contours of that public trust do not depend upon the Constitution. Under accepted principles of federalism, the States retain residual power to determine the scope of the public trust over waters within their borders, while federal law determines riverbed title under the equal-footing doctrine.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b151-5\"><em>PPL Mont., LLC v. Montana, </em>_U.S. at_, 132 S. Ct. at 1235 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b151-7\">\u00b619 Under the equal footing doctrine, then, the State takes title as sovereign to the real property underlying the beds of its navigable waters. \u201cAfter a State enters the Union, title to the land is governed by State law.\u201d <em>Montana v. U.S., </em>450 U.S. 544, 551, 101 S. Ct. 1245, 1251 (1981). The District Court recognized that islands arising after statehood by vertical accretion within a navigable riverbed belong to the State, citing <em>Montana Dep\u2019t of State Lands v. Armstrong, </em>251 Mont. 235, 239, 824 P.2d 255, 256 (1992). The court observed, however, that <em>Armstrong </em>did not hold that such accretions were held in trust for the public schools and, relying on our statement in <em>PPL Montana, </em>held they were not.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-8\">\u00b620 Neither <em>Armstrong </em>nor <em>PPL Montana </em>involved the specific issue before us in this case. The issue addressed in <em>Armstrong </em>was simply whether the State owned the accreted lands in dispute. <em>PPL Montana </em>addressed whether Montana\u2019s navigable streambeds had been classified by the State Land Board as school trust lands under the Montana Constitution. Neither case had occasion to address the statute that is controlling under the facts presented here. Section 77-1-102, MCA, provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b151-9\">(1) The following lands belong to the state of Montana to be held in trust for the benefit of the public schools of the state:...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b151-10\">(b) all islands existing in the navigable streams or lakes in this state that have not been surveyed by the government of the United States.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b151-11\">\u00b621  The statute expressly classifies the ownership of accreted islands such as those at issue in this case. In accordance with the equal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>footing doctrine, once lands pass to the State, \u201cthey are governed by state <em>law.\u201d PPL Mont., </em>\u00b6 48. No challenge has been raised on appeal to the application of the statute in this case. The islands in question belong to the State \u201cto be held in trust for the benefit of the public schools of the state.\u201d Section 77-l-102(l)(b), MCA. It was error for the District Court to hold that the islands are not school trust lands and we reverse on this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-4\">\u00b622 <em>2. Whether the District Court erred by refusing to declare a surveyed boundary between the islands and adjacent private lands based on the State\u2019s evidence.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b152-5\">\u00b623 While the District Court granted summary judgment to quiet title in favor of the State, it also stated that \u201cno legal description is being established by this Judgment\u201d on the ground that there was \u201cnothing in the file\u201d to establish the legal description.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-6\">\u00b624 In addition to the surveys and aerial photographs provided with its original complaint, the State later submitted a metes and bounds description of the property it was claiming under the quiet title action. In December 2008, the State filed the affidavits of Roger Meyer and Ray Breuninger. Meyer, a licensed land surveyor in Montana, discussed his preparation and procedure for the survey he performed on the lands and attached a copy of the survey to his affidavit. Breuninger, a professional geologist, stated his opinion that the lands at issue were formed \u201cafter Statehood by the vertical accretion of sediment upon the bed of the Missouri River.\u201d Attached to his affidavit, Breuninger provided extensive geological analysis supporting his opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-7\">\u00b625 None of the Defendants involved in this case contested the State\u2019s data, methods, or characterization of the boundary lines. The State\u2019s Amended Complaint included a specific description of each of the three island parcels based on the information provided by Meyer and Breuninger.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-8\">\u00b626  Once the District Court ruled that the State was the rightful owner of the islands, the State was entitled to judgment quieting title to the property in its favor. Although the court\u2019s judgment referred in general terms to the location of the \u201cthree islands\u201d at issue, the State\u2019s uncontested evidence was sufficient to support a detailed description of each parcel of property and the descriptions in its Amended Complaint should have been included in the final judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-9\">\u00b627 <em>3. Whether the District Court erred in requiring the State to pay damages for taxes paid and improvements made on the land under the theory of unjust enrichment.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b153-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>\u00b628 The District Court determined that the State \u201cwas unjustly enriched by collecting taxes on property that it should have known, after Armstrong, is \u2018owned\u2019 and on which it should never have collected taxes.\u201d Relying on the principle that \u201c[h]e who seeks equity must do equity,\u201d the court ordered the State to reimburse Defendants for the taxes they paid and the improvements they made on the lands, plus interest. The State asserts three grounds in support of its argument that this order should be reversed. First, Defendants never sought damages or asserted unjust enrichment; second, the District Court was without jurisdiction to award damages against the State on a theory of unjust enrichment, because the State is immune from such a claim; and third, Defendants have an available remedy at law to recover taxes mistakenly paid. We find the first ground dispositive.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-3\">\u00b629 This Court has held that \u201cdue process requires a reasonable notice as to give everyone interested their opportunity to be heard.\u201d <em>Baston v. Baston, </em>2010 MT 207, \u00b6 18, 357 Mont. 470, 474, 240 P.3d 643 (quoting <em>Country Estates Homeowners Assn. v. McMillian, </em>269 Mont. 131, 133, 887 P.2d 249, 241 (1994)). Thus, a party \u201c\u2018cannot recover beyond the case stated by him in his complaint\u2019 because \u2018fair notice to the other party remains essential.\u2019\u201d <em>Bast\u00f3n, </em>\u00b6 18, (quoting <em>McJunkin v. Kaufman &amp; Broad Home Sys., </em>229 Mont. 432, 437, 748 P.2d 910, 913 (1987)).</p>\n<p id=\"b153-4\">\u00b630  Under circumstances similar to those in this case, we reversed a monetary judgment in <em>Bast\u00f3n </em>when the district court awarded damages that were neither requested nor at issue during trial:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b153-5\">Bast\u00f3n was never put on notice she would have to oppose a monetary judgment in the form of a lien against her home. Bast\u00f3n was given notice only that Jeffrey and Sharon claimed ownership of the St. John\u2019s home under the legal theories of adverse possession, gift, and estoppel. Moreover, the only evidence presented by both parties was to support their respective claims of ownership of the home. Jeffrey and Sharon never once pled for, demanded, or even implied that Bast\u00f3n should pay them for alterations done on the St. John\u2019s home.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b153-6\"><em>Bast\u00f3n, </em>\u00b6 20. Here, the only claim under which Defendants sought relief in their counterclaim, and the only argument they raised in their cross-motion for summary judgment, was that they possessed rightful title to the land. While Defendants\u2019 counterclaim included a general prayer for \u201cany other relief the court deems appropriate,\u201d the State was only on notice that Defendants were seeking title under the doctrine of adverse possession and framed its legal arguments <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>accordingly to pertain only to that issue. As in <em>Bast\u00f3n, </em>\u201cneither party addressed the underlying theory of equity upon which the District Court ultimately rested its judgment.\u201d <em>Bast\u00f3n, </em>\u00b6 21. It was therefore improper for the court <em>sua sponte </em>to award Defendants a remedy they never sought and the State had no opportunity to oppose.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-4\">\u00b631 As the State observes, Defendants are not without remedy. The proper procedure for Defendants to recover taxes erroneously collected on the property is to seek a refund by filing a written claim with the board of county commissioners for Richland County. Section 15-16-603, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-5\">\u00b632 <em>4. Whether the District Court erred by denying costs to the State. </em>\u00b633 The District Court ordered each party to pay its own costs and fees. The State subsequently filed a motion to alter or amend the judgment, which was deemed denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-6\">\u00b634 \u201cCosts are allowed, of course, to the plaintiff upon a judgment in the plaintiffs favor in the following cases: ... (5) in an action that involves the title or possession or right of possession of real estate[.]\u201d Section 25-10-101(5), MCA. This language \u201cis not discretionary but is mandatory.\u201d <em>Benintendi v. Hein, </em>2011 MT 298, \u00b6 29, 363 Mont. 32, 265 P.3d 1239 (citing <em>Rolinson v. Bozeman Deaconess Health Servs., Inc., </em>2005 MT 95 \u00b6\u00b6 36, 38, 326 Mont. 491, 111 P.3d 202). Under \u00a7 25-10-201(8), (9), MCA, a party is permitted to include in its costs \u201creasonable expenses for making a map or maps if required and necessary to be used on trial or hearing\u201d and \u201cother reasonable and necessary expenses[.]\u201d In addition to maps, the costs of \u201csurveys are allowed where necessary to explain the situation.\u201d <em>Johnson v. Jarrett, </em>169 Mont. 408, 417, 548 P.2d 144, 149 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b154-7\">\u00b635  In this quiet title action, the State was declared the owner of the disputed lands. As the prevailing party, it is entitled to recover the costs of producing the survey of the boundary of the State-owned land at issue. While the costs were substantial, the law affords the court no discretion. Accordingly, we reverse the District Court\u2019s denial of the State\u2019s costs and remand with instructions to determine and award the appropriate amount pursuant to \u00a7 25-10-101, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-8\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b154-9\">\u00b636 The District Court\u2019s December 11,2011 judgment is reversed and remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<judges id=\"b154-10\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES NELSON, COTTER and WHEAT concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
