We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-19\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b326-20\">\u00b62 Dora Johnson (Dora) and her husband, G. Edward Johnson (Edward), operated a family farm together for many years near Froid, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>Montana. The family farm was operated as a corporation-Johnson Farms, Inc. Dora and Edward had five children: Phyllis Umolac (Phyllis), Kathy Warehime (Kathy), Ray Johnson (Ray), Floyd Johnson (Floyd) and Ethel. Following Edward\u2019s death in 1984, on March 30, 1989, Dora executed a trust agreement (Dora\u2019s Trust Agreement) wherein she designated herself as trustee and two of her children, Ethel and Floyd, as co-trustees. Dora\u2019s Trust Agreement provides that the trustee would deliver the net income of the trust to Dora until such time as she may become incapacitated. In the event that this were to occur, the trustee was responsible for distributing portions of the trust as deemed appropriate. In addition, Dora\u2019s Trust Agreement specifies that upon Dora\u2019s death all of her shares of stock in Johnson Farms, Inc. should be distributed equally to her two sons, Ray and Floyd, and certain sums of money to her three daughters, Ethel, Phyllis and Kathy.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-4\">\u00b63 Dora died on March 4,2006. During the last years of her life Ethel was primarily responsible for her care and financial affairs. In addition to serving as co-trustee for Dora\u2019s Trust Agreement, Ethel was Dora\u2019s power of attorney beginning in 2003, and signed checks on Dora\u2019s behalf from 2003 through 2005. During this time, the assets of Johnson Farms, Inc. were Dora\u2019s sole source of income.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-5\">\u00b64 Ethel also served as secretary of Johnson Farms, Inc. for a period of time that ended in the summer of 2005, following the execution of a family agreement (Johnson Family Agreement). Johnson Family Agreement was signed by all five of Dora\u2019s children and was the result of a family meeting with Alan Nikolaisen, a Plentywood certified public accountant, held on July 7, 2005. Among other provisions, Johnson Family Agreement provides that upon its execution by all five children, the operation and management of Johnson Farms, Inc. would be turned over entirely to Floyd and Ray. In exchange for Floyd and Ray receiving Johnson Farms, Inc. stock and land, Ethel and her two sisters would receive cash. After this meeting, Ethel ceased serving as an officer of Johnson Farms, Inc. and delivered a money order to Floyd for $500.00, which represented the remaining funds in the Johnson Farms, Inc. account.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-6\">\u00b65 On June 11, 2009, Johnson Farms, Inc. and Floyd filed a complaint against Ethel in two counts. The first count alleged that in her capacity as secretary of Johnson Farms, Inc., Ethel breached her fiduciary duties by diverting corporate funds to herself and others, and sought an accounting of funds from Ethel during the time she served as secretary. The second count alleged that \u201c[i]n contravention of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>written trust agreement,\u201d Ethel conferred gifts to herself and other family members. It also sought an accounting of \u201call monies that should have been included in the trust but were diverted by Ethel Halland.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b328-4\">\u00b66 Ethel answered Johnson\u2019s complaint, denying all claims of wrongdoing. On September 3, 2009, she submitted written discovery requests to Johnson, seeking the factual background and documentation in support of the allegations contained in his complaint. After Ethel filed a motion to compel discovery approximately six months later, Johnson answered Ethel\u2019s discovery requests. His answer did not include much of the requested information, and he failed to produce supporting documents. Instead, he responded that \u201cdiscovery [was] continuing\u201d and \u201cdocuments [ ] being subpoenaed.\u201d On November 16, 2010, Ethel sought supplementation of Johnson\u2019s discovery responses; Johnson did not respond.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-5\">\u00b67 Johnson also submitted discovery requests to Ethel, requesting she produce \u201call records in [her] possession pertaining to Johnson Farms, Incorporated.\u201d According to Johnson, on October 15, 2010, Ethel produced bank statements of Johnson Farms, Inc. from December 16, 2004 through September 21, 2005, as well as a check register from April 8,2003 to September 1,2005. Ethel maintained she also produced minutes from various corporate meetings, correspondence from previous family counsel regarding stock certificate transfers, an opinion letter from Mr. Nikolaisen regarding estate planning for Dora, and the Johnson Family Agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-6\">\u00b68 On March 30, 2011, Ethel moved for summary judgment in the District Court, arguing that Johnson\u2019s complaint was barred by the statute of limitations and, further, that no genuine issues of material fact existed to preclude judgment in Ethel\u2019s favor. A hearing was set for September 14, 2011. Just prior to the hearing, Johnson filed two affidavits with the court. The first was an affidavit of Tami Maltese, a certified public accountant (CPA) who reconstructed the income and expense for Johnson Farms, Inc., as well as the shareholders\u2019 respective shares. According to her spreadsheets, the corporation earned $131,676.00 from 1996 through 2005, and Floyd\u2019s share of that net income was $47,101.38. Johnson also filed an affidavit of Floyd, in which he maintained that he never received a dividend or other payment from Johnson Farms, Inc. since 1997.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-7\">\u00b69 At the hearing, Johnson argued Ethel was equitably estopped from asserting a statute of limitations defense, a theory he had not yet raised in this case. The court gave the parties the opportunity for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>supplemental briefing on the point. In addition to arguing in his brief the doctrine of equitable estoppel, Johnson notably clarified that he was pleading a breach of contract claim, subject to an eight-year statute of limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-4\">\u00b610 OnNovember 14,2011, the District Court granted Ethel\u2019s motion, finding that Ethel successfully established there were no material issues of fact and that the CPA only identified a profit dollar amount, but nothing further to establish any liability by Ethel. The District Court determined that equitable estoppel did not toll the statute of limitations; however, it did not discuss the statute of limitations defense any further. The District Court also awarded Ethel attorneys\u2019 fees and costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-5\">\u00b611 Johnson appeals the judgment entered in favor of Ethel, arguing that the District Court erred in granting Ethel\u2019s motion for summary judgment based on the statute of limitations and awarding Ethel attorneys\u2019 fees and costs. We note, however, that due to the brevity of the District Court\u2019s order it is somewhat unclear whether it actually relied on the statute of limitations in making its decision-and if so which period(s) it actually applied-or instead solely based its conclusion on its determination that Johnson failed to prove the existence of any genuine issue of material fact. Nevertheless, where the conclusion of the district court is correct, it is immaterial, for the purpose of affirmance on appeal, what reasons the district court gives for its conclusion. <em>Erker v. Kester, </em>1999 MT 231, \u00b6 21, 296 Mont. 123, 988 P.2d 1221. If we reach the same conclusion as the district court, but on different grounds, we may affirm the district court\u2019s judgment. <em>In re Formation of East Bench Irrigation </em>Dist., 2009 MT 135, \u00b6 20, 350 Mont. 309, 207 P.3d 1097.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-6\">\u00b612 We acknowledge Ethel\u2019s contention on appeal that her motion for summary judgment may be properly granted on one of two theories: the running of the statute of limitations and the existence of no genuine issues of material fact. Because we hold that Johnson\u2019s claims are barred by the statute of limitations, it is not necessary we consider the question of whether the District Court correctly determined there were no genuine issues of material fact. We therefore reach the same decision as the District Court, addressing the following issues:</p>\n<p id=\"b329-7\">\u00b613 <em>Issue One: Are Johnson\u2019s claims barred by the statute of limitations?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b329-8\">\u00b614 <em>Issue Two: Should Johnson be held responsible for payment of Ethel\u2019s attorneys\u2019 fees and costs?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b330-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>STANDARDS OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b330-4\">\u00b615 We review the grant of summary judgment de novo, using the same M. R. Civ. P. 56 criteria used by the District Court. <em>Albert v. City of Billings, </em>2012 MT 159, \u00b6 15, 365 Mont. 454, 282 P.3d 704. Summary judgment is appropriate when the moving party demonstrates both the absence of any genuine issues of material fact and entitlement to judgment as a matter of law. <em>Albert, </em>\u00b6 15. Once the moving party has met its burden, the non-moving party must present substantial evidence essential to one or more elements of the case to raise a genuine issue of material fact. <em>Styren Farms, Inc. v. Roos, </em>2011 MT 299, \u00b6 10, 363 Mont. 41, 265 P.3d 1230. Conclusory s6tatements are insufficient to raise a genuine issue of material fact. <em>Styren Farms Inc., </em>\u00b6 10. We further review a question of law to determine if the district court\u2019s legal conclusions are correct. <em>Palmer v. Bahm, </em>2006 MT 29, \u00b6 11, 331 Mont. 105, 128 P.3d 1031.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-5\">\u00b616 We review for correctness a district court\u2019s decision as to whether legal authority exists to award attorneys\u2019 fees. <em>Benintendi v. Hein, </em>2011 MT 298, \u00b6 16, 363 Mont. 32, 265 P.3d 1239. Additionally, we review for an abuse of discretion a district court\u2019s order granting or denying attorney fees if legal authority exists for the fees. <em>Benintendi, </em>\u00b6 16.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b330-7\">\u00b617 <em>Issue One: Are Johnson\u2019s claims barred by the statute of limitations?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b330-8\">\u00b618 Johnson\u2019s complaint sets forth two counts against Ethel, both of which Johnson argues are founded upon a writing and hence subject to an eight-year statute of limitations period. He additionally contends that even if this Court applies a shorter period, the doctrine of equitable estoppel and the discovery rule serve as a bar to a statute of limitations defense. We address each of Johnson\u2019s arguments in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-9\">Statute of Limitations</p>\n<p id=\"b330-10\">\u00b619  When deciding which statute of limitations applies, this Court will look to the substance of the complaint. <em>Action Enters, by &amp; Through Lindeman v. McCalla, </em>259 Mont. 167, 169, 855 P.2d 111, 113 (1993) (citing <em>Weible v. Ronan State Bank, </em>238 Mont. 235, 237, 776 P.2d 837, 838 (1989)). \u201c Tf the gravamen of the action rests strictly on tort theories, the statute of limitations pertaining to torts will apply.\u2019 \u201d <em>Action Enters., </em>259 Mont. at 169, 855 P.2d at 113 (quoting <em>Weible, </em>238 Mont. at 237, 776 P.2d at 838). Likewise, if the gravamen rests strictly on contract theories, the statute of limitations pertaining to contracts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>will apply. <em>Weible, </em>238 Mont. at 237, 776 P.2d at 838. The contract statute of limitations applies only if the alleged breach of a specific provision in a contract provides the basis of the plaintiffs claims. <em>Tin Cup County Water v. Garden City Plumbing &amp; Heating, </em>Inc., 2008 MT 434, \u00b6 26, 347 Mont. 468, 200 P.3d 60. On the other hand, if the plaintiff claims breach of a legal duty imposed by law that arises during the performance of a contract, the action sounds in tort and the tort statute of limitations will apply. <em>Tin Cup, </em>\u00b6 26 (citing <em>Northern Montana Hosp. v. Knight, </em>248 Mont. 310, 315, 811 P.2d 1276, 1278-79 (1991)).</p>\n<p id=\"b331-4\">\u00b620 In <em>Tin Cup </em>we highlighted the limitations on a plaintiffs ability to choose which theory to pursue in a given situation. \u00b6 30. There, plaintiff Tin Cup brought suit against several defendants based on claims of poor supervision of a construction project. <em>Tin Cup, </em>\u00b6 27. Although Tin Cup alleged its claims were subject to the eight-year contract statute of limitations-and pointed to two contracts which, if read together, created legal duties that the defendant allegedly breached-this Court held that the gravamen of the claim was negligence and was thus subject to the shorter tort statute of limitations. <em>Tin Cup, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 31, 36. We reiterated that a plaintiff simply may not choose which theory to pursue in any situation; there is a choice between a tort and contract cause of action \u201conly where the substance of the complaint and the nature of the action give them the right to choose.\u201d <em>Tin Cup, </em>\u00b6 30. Even though Tin Cup\u2019s complaint expressly referenced two written agreements, we concluded that since it could not \u201cpoint to the violation of a specific contractual provision,\u201d the claim did not sound in contract. <em>Tin Cup, \u00b6 </em>30 (citing <em>Northern Montana, </em>248 Mont. at 315, 811 P.2d at 1278-79).</p>\n<p id=\"b331-5\">\u00b621 In the case before us, the rather unclear and undeveloped arguments in Johnson\u2019s complaint and their lack of factual support make it difficult to decipher exactly what claims were asserted. Count one alleged that in Ethel\u2019s capacity as secretary, she \u201cbreached her fiduciary duty to Johnson Farms, Incorporated by expending monies of Johnson Farms, Incorporated for her own personal expenses\u201d and \u201cdiverted funds belonging to Johnson Farms, Incorporated to other sources.\u201d In the brief on appeal, Johnson argues that at issue is an action founded upon a writing because \u201cobligations arise under Dora\u2019s trust on her death in 2006 and perhaps under the written agreement dated 2005.\u201d However, the complaint gives no mention of any written agreement, let alone an allegation of a violation of a specific contractual provision. Further, aside from a few vague statements <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>made in Johnson\u2019s answer to Ethel\u2019s discovery requests, we are provided with no additional information to support or explain Johnson\u2019s claims. We are thus led to the conclusion that count one in Johnson\u2019s complaint is a claim of a breach of fiduciary duty or possibly conversion, but not contract. <em>See Action </em>Enters., 259 Mont. 167, 855 P.2d 111 (holding that a plaintiffs claim to recover for alleged unauthorized taking of corporate funds for his own benefit involved an allegation of conversion, subject to a two-year statute of limitations). \u00b622  All allegations in count one refer to events which occurred while Ethel was an officer of Johnson Farms, Inc., and both parties agree that Ethel ceased serving as an officer following the family meeting in the summer of2005. Because Johnson has not asserted any facts in count one which occurred after this time, any alleged misappropriation of funds that would give rise to count one occurred prior to the summer of 2005. Consequently, whether the complaint raised a breach of fiduciary duty claim or one of conversion, its filing on June 11, 2009, was untimely pursuant to \u00a7 27-2-204, MCA, and \u00a7 27-2-207(2), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-4\">\u00b623 With regard to count two of his complaint, Johnson argues he pled a \u201cstraight breach of contract claim.\u201d We disagree. Although Johnson\u2019s complaint references a written agreement, like <em>Tin Cup, </em>he failed to point to the violation of a specific contractual provision. In fact, it was not until more than two years after Johnson filed his complaint that he first explicitly clarified that he was pleading a breach of contract claim. Johnson\u2019s complaint only vaguely alleged wrongful conduct in \u201ccontravention of the written trust agreement.\u201d Nothing further was argued or presented to the District Court that identified the existence of a breach of contract claim until Johnson\u2019s supplementary brief filed on October 4,2011. Additionally, it is unclear which written agreement he actually asserts his claims are founded on-Dora\u2019s March 30,1989, Trust Agreement or the Johnson Family Agreement executed in the summer of 2005.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-5\">\u00b624  Similar to <em>Tin Cup, </em>where the gravamen of Tin Cup\u2019s arguments sounded in tort theory, we conclude that the nature of Johnson\u2019s claims in count two against Ethel rests upon a claim of either a breach of fiduciary duty or conversion. The single allegation made in the complaint is that Ethel \u201ccaused gifts to be made to herself and other family members.\u201d In a response to discovery, the only facts he presented in support of this allegation were that Ethel \u201cused a power of attorney to take Dora\u2019s name off funds that were from the sale of the Canadian farm land and other accounts originally ear <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>marked for all of Dora\u2019s children. These funds went to Ethel and her sisters only.\u201d These allegations Johnson raised regarding count two, if true, occurred during Dora\u2019s lifetime. Therefore, the statute of limitations began to run, at the latest, upon Dora\u2019s death on March 4, 2006. Johnson\u2019s June 11, 2009, filing of his complaint was barred by both a two and three-year statute of limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-4\">\u00b625  On appeal, Johnson points out that Montana adheres to the notice pleading requirements of a short and plain statement showing the pleader is entitled to relief, and argues his breach of contract claims were thus adequately pled. However, we have previously explained that a claim must \u201cgive notice to the other party of the facts which the pleader expects to prove, and the facts must disclose the presence of all the elements necessary to make out a claim.\u201d <em>Mysse v. Martens, </em>279 Mont. 253, 266, 926 P.2d 765, 773 (1996). Because Johnson did not specify in his complaint that he was raising a breach of contract claim, nor did he set forth facts regarding specific actions or inactions by Ethel that would make known that he was pleading such a claim, he failed to adequately plead a breach of contract claim. \u00b626 Johnson correctly recognizes we have previously held that when there is a question as to which of two or more statutes of limitations should apply, the general rule is that the doubt should be resolved in favor of the statute containing the longest limitations. <em>Thiel v. Taurus Drilling, </em>218 Mont. 201, 212, 710 P.2d 33, 40 (1985). However, we have emphasized that this is when there is a \u201csubstantial question\u201d as to which statute of limitations should apply. <em>See e.g. Royal Ins. Co. v. Roadarmel, </em>2000 MT 259, \u00b6\u00b6 19, 21, 301 Mont. 508, 11 P.3d 105. Here, we do not find such a substantial question. Based on our analysis above, we determine that his claims sounded in tort theory rather than contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-5\">Equitable Estoppel and the Discovery Rule</p>\n<p id=\"b333-6\">\u00b627 Johnson additionally argues that even if a shorter statute of limitations applies, it would be barred by the doctrine of equitable estoppel and the discovery rule. The doctrine of equitable estoppel prevents one party from unconscionably taking advantage of a wrong while asserting a strict legal right. <em>Cascade Dev., Inc. v. City of Bozeman, </em>2012 MT 79, \u00b6 23, 364 Mont. 442, 276 P.3d 862. It is grounded in both statute and case law, and is applied to prevent an inequitable result. <em>Cascade Dev., Inc., </em>\u00b6 23. Estoppel will grant relief when, in view of all the circumstances, to deny it would permit one of the parties to suffer a gross wrong at the hands of the other party who brought about the condition. <em>In re Estate of Stukey, </em>2004 MT 279, \u00b6 37, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>323 Mont. 241, 100 P.3d 114. Estoppel is an appropriate remedy if a party is denied the right to prove an otherwise important fact because of something which the party has done or omitted to do. <em>In re Estate of Stukey, </em>\u00b6 37. It is not favored and will be sustained only upon clear and convincing evidence. <em>In re Estate of Stukey, </em>\u00b6 37.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-4\">\u00b628 It is well established under Montana law that a party must prove six elements in order to succeed on an equitable estoppel claim: (1) the existence of conduct, acts, language, or silence amounting to a representation or concealment of material facts; (2) the party estopped must have knowledge of these facts at the time of the representation or concealment, or the circumstances must be such that knowledge is necessarily imputed to that party; (3) the truth concerning these facts must be unknown to the other party at the time it was acted upon; (4) the conduct must be done with the intention or expectation that it will be acted upon by the other party, or have occurred under circumstances showing it to be both natural and probable that it will be acted upon; (5) the conduct must be relied upon by the other party and lead that party to act; and (6) the other party must in fact act upon the conduct in such a manner as to change its position for the worse. <em>Pankratz Farms, Inc. v. Pankratz, </em>2004 MT 180, \u00b6 67, 322 Mont. 133, 95 P.3d 671 (internal citations omitted). All six elements must be established before the doctrine can be invoked. <em>Pankratz Farms, Inc., </em>167.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-5\">129 Johnson argues that it was not until Ethel turned over Johnson Farms\u2019 bank statements and check register on October 15, 2010, that he became aware of Ethel\u2019s alleged misappropriation of funds. Such action, Johnson contends, amounts to a \u201cfraudulent concealment\u201d invoking the doctrine of equitable estoppel. We find Johnson\u2019s argument unconvincing for two reasons. First, we cannot find any fact in the record that supports Johnson\u2019s assertion that Ethel concealed any financial information. While Johnson repeatedly claims that Ethel remained in possession of the farm\u2019s financial information, \u201cconcealing her actions,\u201d his assertions amount to no more than mere speculation. Neither Johnson\u2019s response to Ethel\u2019s discovery requests or his own discovery requests produced any evidence supporting these claims. The only support Johnson submitted to the District Court was the two affidavits of the CPA and Floyd. The CPA\u2019s affidavit supplies us with a profit dollar amount for the corporation, and Floyd\u2019s claimed portion of such net income, while Floyd\u2019s affidavit essentially just repeats the allegations of his complaint. Neither provides anything that would lead us to question Ethel\u2019s actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>\u00b630 Second, Johnson\u2019s argument fails to recognize that equitable estoppel requires a complaining party to lack actual knowledge of the true facts of the case as well as a readily available means of discovering them. <em>Cascade Dev., Inc., </em>\u00b6 26. Further, we will not apply the doctrine of equitable estoppel where both parties have the same opportunity to determine the truth of the facts at issue. <em>Elk Park Ranch v. Park County, </em>282 Mont. 154, 166, 935 P.2d 1131, 1138 (1997). Here, at the time Ethel delivered the $500 check to Floyd in the summer of 2005, she was no longer an officer of Johnson Farms, Inc., and Floyd and Ray were in complete control of its operation and management. As part-owner of 100% of the corporation, Floyd either knew or should have known of the financial status of the corporation, and had the same, if not better, opportunity as Ethel to access any information that he believed supported a case.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-4\">\u00b631 Johnson argues that whether Ethel concealed the financial records or whether her wrongdoings should have been discovered earlier are issues of fact that \u201care exactly the type of factual questions appropriate for resolution by the trier of fact.\u201d Johnson cites <em>Young v. Datsopoulos, </em>249 Mont. 466, 817 P.2d 225 (1991), to support this proposition, and further relies on <em>Stanley L. &amp; Carolyn M. Watkins Trust v. Lacosta, </em>2004 MT 144, 321 Mont. 432, 92 P.3d 620, and <em>Mills v. Mills, </em>305 P.2d 61 (Cal. Dist. Ct. App. 1956). All three cases are distinguishable from the case at hand and none support Johnson\u2019s position.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-5\">\u00b632 Johnson\u2019s reliance on <em>Young </em>is misplaced. In <em>Young, </em>the plaintiff sued the defendant for legal malpractice, and the District Court granted the defendant partial summary judgment on the basis that the claim was barred by the statute of limitations. 249 Mont. at 470, 817 P.2d at 227. This Court reversed the District Court\u2019s decision, stating that whether or not malpractice occurred may be inherently unknowable to the lay client, thereby affecting the date of accrual of the claim. <em>Young, </em>249 Mont. at 473, 817 P.2d at 229. We recognized that in a complex legal malpractice suit, a client may not be cognizant of the facts which form the basis of the suit because the matter is not within the range of knowledge of the average lay person. <em>Young, </em>249 Mont. at 472, 817 P.2d at 229. Thus, when it was or should have been knowable to the plaintiff was \u201cthe type of factual question appropriate for resolution by a trier of fact.\u201d <em>Young, </em>249 Mont. at 473, 817 P.2d at 229. Here, in contrast, there is nothing that leads us to reason that the nature of Johnson\u2019s claim was such that Johnson would not understand or recognize what facts may or may not support his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>allegations. Instead, he argues that he did not have knowledge of them because Ethel concealed them, not because they were not within his range of knowledge or because his claims were \u201cinherently unknowable\u201d to a lay person, as they were in <em>Young.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b336-4\">\u00b633 Johnson\u2019s reliance on <em>Watkins Trust </em>is similarly unpersuasive. There, we held that a statute of limitations did not begin to run until a plaintiff discovered, or with reasonable diligence should have discovered, the act, error, or omission that led to the rise of their claim. <em>Watkins Trust, </em>\u00b6 44. We further recognized that whether a plaintiff should have discovered the act, error, or omission is dependent on any fraudulent concealment by the defendant. <em>Watkins Trust, </em>\u00b6 44. In <em>Watkins Trust, </em>the plaintiffs sued an attorney for legal malpractice and claimed that the statute of limitations for their action should be tolled because the attorney fraudulently concealed information regarding their claim. <em>Watkins Trust, </em>\u00b6 37. Unlike the case at hand, in <em>Watkins Trust </em>we found actual evidence in the district court record that supported the plaintiffs\u2019 allegation that the attorney concealed information from them, including statements and actions made by the attorney. <em>Watkins Trust, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 10-11, 47. Here, if the record contained any evidence that raised a genuine issue of material fact regarding any concealment by Ethel, it would be appropriate for resolution by the trier of fact. However, the record is bare of any firm allegations of concealment supported by evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-5\">\u00b634 Johnson further urges this Court to follow <em>Mills v. Mills, </em>a case in which a California appellate court invoked the doctrine of equitable estoppel to bar a statute of limitations defense. In <em>Mills, </em>the defendant, Oscar Mills (Mills), purchased a piece of property from his parents, signing a promissory note for partial consideration. <em>Mills, </em>305 P.2d at 64. Mills never paid any portion of the note and, following his parents\u2019 death, he allegedly concealed his indebtedness for the property from his other family members, with whom he had relationships of trust and confidence. <em>Mills, </em>305 P.2d at 64-65. Because of Mills\u2019 concealment, his family members refrained from investigating their rights, titles, and interest in the property, and Mills argued their claim against him regarding their rights in the realty was barred by the statute of limitations. <em>Mills, </em>305 P.2d at 66, 69. Determining that Mills \u201cfraudulently and deceitfully concealed\u201d information relevant to the plaintiffs\u2019 claims, the court invoked the doctrine of equitable estoppel to prevent Mills from relying on the statute of limitations to bar plaintiffs\u2019 claims. <em>Mills, </em>305 P.2d at 65, 72.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-6\">\u00b635  Johnson argues the present case is factually similar to <em>Mills, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>and we should thus follow the California appellate court\u2019s holding. We disagree. Unlike the case before us, the <em>Mills\u2019 </em>court was presented with a host of actual statements and specific representations made by Mills to his family members that tended to prove a possible fraudulent concealment of his indebtedness for the unpaid purchase price of the realty. <em>Mills, </em>305 P.2d at 65. It was because of such evidence that the court held the cause of action was not barred by the statue of limitations. <em>Mills, </em>305 P.2d at 72. As previously explained, Johnson did not present sufficient evidence to establish the existence of a material issue of fact regarding Ethel\u2019s concealment of financial information. \u00b636 For these reasons, we conclude that the District Court did not err in determining that equitable estoppel does not toll the statute of limitations for Johnson\u2019s claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-4\">\u00b637 In addition to equitable estoppel, Johnson argues on appeal that Ethel\u2019s statute of limitation defense is tolled by the discovery rule. Under the discovery rule, the statute of limitations begins when the plaintiff discovers or through the use of reasonable diligence should have discovered the negligent act. Section 27-2-102(3), MCA. Whether a plaintiff discovers or should have discovered the act depends on whether the defect is concealed. Section 27-2-102(3), MCA. Because we just determined Johnson failed to show any concealment on Ethel\u2019s behalf, we reject this argument for the same reasons as we reject the equitable estoppel claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-5\">\u00b638 <em>Issue Two: Should Johnson be held responsible for payment of Ethel\u2019s attorneys\u2019 fees and costs?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b337-6\">\u00b639  Johnson argues that the District Court erred in awarding Ethel attorneys\u2019 fees and costs for her defense of count one under Montana\u2019s corporate indemnity statutes, and of count two under the provisions of Dora\u2019s Trust Agreement. Specifically, he asserts on appeal that Ethel should not be indemnified against liability because she did not engage in good faith conduct and her actions were not in the best interests of Johnson Farms, Inc. Yet, Johnson never raised these arguments before the District Court, nor did he object to Ethel\u2019s claimed attorneys\u2019 fees and costs that were granted at a January 11, 2012, hearing. This Court will not put a district court in error for failing to address an issue or argument that was not made before it. <em>Nielsen v. Hornsteiner, </em>2012 MT 102, \u00b6 17, 365 Mont. 64, 277 P.3d 1241 (citing <em>Prescott v. Innovative Res. Group, LLC, </em>2010 MT 35, \u00b6 14, 355 Mont. 220, 225 P.3d 1253). Because Johnson never properly presented the District Court with an objection to the award of attorneys\u2019 fees, let alone an argument in support of such an objection, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>we affirm the District Court\u2019s decision to award Ethel attorneys\u2019 fees and costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-4\">\u00b640  Ethel claims that she is entitled to the costs of her appeal pursuant to Rule 19(3)(a) of the Montana Rules of Appellate Procedure. M. R. App. P. 19(3)(a) allows costs on appeal to be awarded to the prevailing party unless otherwise specifically provided in the decision by this Court. \u201cTaxable costs include costs of reproducing briefs and necessary appendices, costs incurred in transmission of the record, cost of the reporter\u2019s transcript if necessary for the determination of the appeal, and the fee for filing the notice of appeal.\u201d M. R. App. P. 19(3)(a). As the prevailing party, Ethel is entitled to the costs of this appeal. This is a factual matter that must be resolved by the District Court on remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-5\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b338-6\">\u00b641 For the reasons stated above, we affirm the District Court\u2019s Order granting Ethel\u2019s motion for summary judgment and attorneys\u2019 fees and costs. We remand for further proceedings in accordance with this Opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-7\">\u00b642 Affirmed and Remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b338-8\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES COTTER, MORRIS and RICE concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
