Russell, Jr. was involved in an automobile accident while driving a police car. He sought uninsured (UM) motorist benefits from the Continental Insurance Company (Continental), insurer of the fleet of vehicles owned by Riverside Township (Township), and from Prudential Property and Casualty Insurance Company (Prudential), insurer of his personal automobile. Prudential instituted a declaratory judgment action against Continental, contending that Continental\u2019s combined UM limit for the fleet must be paid by Continental before applying Prudential\u2019s UM policy limit.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Continental conceded primary liability for the UM coverage of the individual car driven by Officer Russell ($15,000), but resisted applying the combined limit of $120,000. On cross-motions for summary judgment, judgment was granted to Prudential and denied to Continental. Continental appeals and we reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-10\">The accident occurred on March 17,1983, prior to the January 1,1984 legislation which amended <em>N.J.S.A. </em>17:28-1.1 to prohibit stacking of UM coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-11\">The Continental policy provided that the municipality was the named insured and that it was entitled to UM insurance for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>each of eight vehicles. These were separately listed with a UM limit of 15/30/5 and a per-vehicle premium of varying amounts assigned. The policy said,</p>\n<p id=\"b293-5\">II. PERSONS INSURED</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b293-6\">Each of the following is an insured under this insurance to the extent set forth below:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b293-7\">(a) the named insured and any designated insured and, while residents of the same household, the spouse and relatives of either;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b293-8\">(b) any other person while occupying an an insured highway vehicle; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b293-9\">(c) any person, with respect to damages he is entitled to recover because of bodily injury to which this insurance applies sustained by an insured under (a) or (b) above.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b293-10\">The insurance applies separately with respect to each insured, except with respect to the limits of the company\u2019s liability.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b293-11\">In <em>Lundy v. Aetna Cas. &amp; Sur. Co., </em>92 <em>N.J. </em>550, 560 (1983), the Supreme Court held that under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>17:28-l.l(a), as then written, and as applicable here, an insurer issuing a policy covering a number of vehicles for a named insured and for any additional insureds for which a per-vehicle premium was charged, was required to treat the UM coverage for each car as if separate policies had been issued. In <em>Lundy </em>it was conceded that had the named insured had separate policies for each of his cars, with the claimant as an additional insured on each, every policy would have been available to the claimant. Therefore, the limits were separately applicable and the insurer owed its insured a \u201cstacked\u201d coverage on the one policy which covered three cars. The <em>Lundy </em>court relied upon policy language relating to the insured, the intent of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>17:28-1.1 to protect an insured irrespective of whether the insured\u2019s automobile was involved in the accident and the insurer\u2019s charge of independent premiums based on each vehicle covered. 92 <em>N.J. </em>at 560.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-12\">In <em>Lundy </em>(and other cases relied upon by Prudential) the claimants were additional insureds under the named insured\u2019s policy. From a contract construction point of view, the equiva<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>lent of clause 11(a) above applied.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> As the Supreme Court noted in <em>Lundy, </em>the claimant as a named insured was protected by UM coverage both for an accident in which the claimant occupied a covered car, but also for an accident respecting <em>any </em>car in which the named insured was injured by an uninsured driver. <em>See also Motor Club of America Ins. Co. v. Phillips, </em>66 <em>N.J. </em>277 at 282 (1974); <em>Childs v. New Jersey Manufacturers Ins. Co., </em>199 <em>N.J.Super. </em>441 at 449 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b294-5\">Russell was not a named insured, or a member of a named insured\u2019s family, but an employee of the named insured. Russell was a person covered for an accident with an uninsured motorist under clause 11(b), not 11(a) above, as a person \u201coccupying\u201d an insured vehicle, unless by some construction of the contract one could conclude that Continental extended to Russell the same UM coverage as to a named insured. <em>Lundy, </em>92 <em>N.J. </em>at 555. We find no such language.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-6\">While it is undisputed that the precise issue raised here has not been addressed by our Supreme Court, in <em>Guarantee Ins. Co. v. Anderson, </em>585 <em>F.Supp. </em>408 (E.D.Pa.1984), the United States District Court predicted that the New Jersey Supreme Court would not apply <em>Lundy </em>to a fleet policy, saying,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b294-7\">The [UM] coverage extended to the <em>Lundy </em>plaintiffs regardless of whether their injuries were sustained in an insured vehicle. \u201cHowever, this argument and reasoning does not apply to a permissive user of a vehicle who pays no premium and does not receive the broader uninsured motorist coverage of a named insured.\u201d <em>Cunningham v. Insurance Co. of North, America, </em>213 <em>Va. </em>72, 189 <em>S.E.2d </em>832, 836 (1972). <em>[Id. </em>at 413],</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b294-8\">We regard this reasoning as persuasive. If Continental had a separate policy for each of its eight cars, Russell, a permis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>sive user, would be covered only under the policy of the car he drove.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-6\">Moreover in <em>Lundy </em>(apparently assuming that it would be unlikely that the claimant under a fleet policy would be a named insured or the equivalent) the Court described the claim made in this case (that per-car limits in a fleet policy should be stacked) as a \u201cfar fetched\u201d result of its ruling. 92 <em>N.J. </em>at 556 n. 2. That characterization was relied upon by the dissent which said that stacking coverage in a commercial fleet demonstrated the absurdity of UM coverage stacking. <em>Id. </em>at 564, citing Appleman (8C <em>Appleman, Insurance Law and Practice </em>(1981), \u00a7 5101 at 444, 449-451, which generally criticized \u201cstacking\u201d as commercially uneconomic).</p>\n<p id=\"b295-7\">Applying the rationale in <em>Lundy </em>persuades us, as it did the District Court, that Prudential\u2019s reliance on <em>Lundy </em>is misplaced. Nothing in the statute or in the contract supported the interpretation Prudential sought, a result which the dissent in <em>Lundy </em>called, \u201can absurdity, which no company could possibly afford to insure.\u201d 92 <em>N.J. </em>at 564.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-8\">The judgment appealed from is reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b292-12\"> Russell\u2019s Prudential policy had a UM limit of $100,000.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b294-9\">The exact provisions of the <em>Lundy </em>policy are not contained in the opinion, except the reference to the claimant as an \"additional insured.\u201d In <em>Motor Club of America Ins. Co. v. Phillips, </em>66 <em>N.J. </em>277, 280-281 (1974), the claimant was considered an \"insured\" under his spouse\u2019s policy. In <em>Childs v. New Jersey Manufacturers Ins. Co., </em>199 <em>N.J.Super. </em>441, 446 (App.Div.1985), rev\u2019d on other grounds 108 <em>N.J. </em>506 (1987), the claimant was considered an \"insured\" under his father\u2019s policy.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
