Relevant transcripts were received by the Clerk of the Court November 20, 1986. Her appellate brief was filed by substituted designated counsel on May 5, 1988. The prosecutor\u2019s re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>sponding brief was filed October 11, 1988.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The appeal was calendared before us for April 19, 1989.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-6\">On appeal S.T.\u2019s only challenge to the delinquency adjudication is that her defense counsel\u2019s trial performance constituted ineffective assistance of counsel. S.T. was charged with two assaults, one in 1985 and one in 1986. The 1985 charges arose while she was at McCorkle. There S.T. became involved in an altercation with another McCorkle resident. A senior corrections officer interceded, and, with the help of staff and McCorkle residents, broke up the fight. When S.T. heard she was to be placed in \u201clock-up,\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> she swung a metal chair and hit the officer on the head.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-7\">S.T. described the event as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b633-8\">It was a chair beside me, and I said for you hitting my neck I\u2019m gonna hit you. So she \u2014 wait a minute, she had came and said you hit me with that chair, you won\u2019t hit nobody else. And Miss Jackson she had came over, tried to get the chair away from me, and I went to hit Bonita with it and she got in the way and she got hit with it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b633-9\">S.T. was not tried respecting the five charges stemming from this incident until considerably later. On November 8, 1985, she was recalled from McCorkle and placed on probation for one year with a condition that she enter and successfully complete the program at the Devereaux School, a residential school in Pennsylvania. For reasons described as \u201clegal,\u201d S.T. entered Devereaux but was retransferred to Pinelands Learning Center (Pinelands), a New Jersey learning center with programs for emotionally disturbed children.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-10\">On April 9, 1986, three weeks after S.T. returned to Pine-lands, she was in another altercation with a student. S.T.\u2019s teacher attempted to subdue them. S.T. hit her. The teacher <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>fell to the floor. The desk fell on them. As S.T. left the room, against the teacher\u2019s order, she shoved the teacher against the door. The teacher testified that she received bruises, a stiff neck, headaches and numbness in her left arm. When New Jersey State Police Trooper Robert Kwapp advised S.T. she was being put under arrest, S.T. started punching and biting. She had to be wrestled by two troopers to the ground and handcuffed. She continued to resist being taken from the building.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-4\">S.T. testified she was attacked by the other student and when the teacher tried to break it up, they ended up on the floor. S.T. admitted she left the room against orders to call her mother. She denied trying to fight the officers. She said she would not give the trooper her hand. Then the trooper threw her on the floor and started fighting her.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-5\">For the first incident the Family Part judge found S.T. guilty of simple assault on the other McCorkle resident, aggravated assault by attempting to cause bodily injury to the corrections officer with a weapon, possession of a weapon for unlawful purposes and unlawful use of a weapon. For the second incident the Family Part judge found S.T. guilty of aggravated assault by committing simple assault on a teacher and resisting arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-6\">Our review of the record persuades us that S.T.\u2019s first argument challenging the effectiveness of her counsel at the trial resulting in her adjudication is clearly without merit. <em>R. </em>2:ll-3(e)(2). The evidence of her guilt of the merged charges was overwhelming. Thus, any deficiency of counsel could not have effected a different result and is not cause for reversal. <em>State v. Fritz, </em>105 <em>N.J. </em>42, 60 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b634-7\">We concentrate on her remaining argument, a challenge to her disposition. According to the pre-disposition report, S.T. was bom August 28, 1972, the youngest of 14 children. She lived with her mother, an older sister and several other relatives. She first became involved with the juvenile system in 1980. The record shows that by age 13 S.T. had an extensive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>record of assaults and aggressive behavior toward her peers, her teachers and police officers, including fist fights, punching or shoving teachers, using bottles and knives as weapons and resisting arrest. Thorazine and mellaril had been prescribed to control her aggressive behavior.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-6\">We recite here in some detail the failure of the community and delinquency procedures to have alleviated S.T.\u2019s delinquency behavior and her troubled history.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> On March 21, 1988, S.T. was given a probationary term of one year and ordered to attend a diagnostic and counseling program. On November 30, 1983, her probation was extended one year. She was ordered to attend the Cumberland County Juvenile Advocacy Counseling Program. On June 21, 1984, she received a continued disposition for one year <em>(N.J.S.A. </em>2A:4A-43b(l); <em>R. </em>5:24-8). It was recommended that she undergo a complete evaluation and treatment at Brisbane. At Brisbane in 1984 S.T. was classified as being perceptually impaired and described as immature. She was further diagnosed as suffering from a schizophrenic form of disorder. While at McCorkle in 1985, however, S.T. was diagnosed as having a conduct disorder. Her July 18, 1985 psychiatric report said that her aggression was planned, based on her belief \u201cthat if one remains aggressive long enough one can determine the conditions of peace.\u201d She was also there described as being emotionally immature, having a low self-esteem and having problems relating with peers and authority figures. On March 15, 1985, following a delinquency adjudication that she was guilty of possession of a weapon for an unlawful purpose, aggravated assault and resisting arrest, she was placed at McCorkle for an indeterminate term not to exceed two years. She was also referred to DYFS for a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>residential placement. It was during this commitment that the first incident forming the basis of this appeal occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-4\">The primary basis for the public defender\u2019s argument that S.T. should receive another disposition is that she was classified as emotionally disturbed and attended Pinelands, receiving special instruction for the emotionally disturbed.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> She was thus \u201chandicapped\u201d under 20 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 1401(a)(1) of the Education of the Handicapped Act (Act) and <em>N.J.A.C. </em>6:28-3.5. As \u201chandicapped\u201d under the Act she required an individualized educational program (I.E.P.), containing:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b636-5\">(A) a statement of the present levels of educational performance of such child,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b636-6\">(B) a statement of annual goals, including short-term instructional objectives,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b636-7\">(C) a statement of the specific educational services to be provided to such child, and the extent to which the child will be able to participate in regular educational programs,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b636-8\">(D) the projected date for initiation and anticipated duration of such services, and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b636-9\">(E) appropriate objective criteria and evaluation procedures and schedules for determining, on at least an annual basis, whether instructional objectives are being achieved. [20 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 1401(a)(19)]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b636-10\">In this appeal the public defender asserts that the Act prohibits school expulsion of a handicapped student for misbehavior that is a manifestation of her handicap and that the New Jersey Department of Education regulations relating specifically to the discipline of handicapped children, <em>N.J.A.C. </em>6:28-2.8, apply to S.T. If so, an independent evaluation of the child\u2019s educational needs was necessary prior to any action of expulsion or change in placement under 20 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 1415(b)(1)(A); <em>N.J.A.C. </em>6:28-2.8(d) &amp; (e).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b637-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>Separately, the public defender urges that federal law mandates that defendant be educated in the least restrictive environment, 20 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 1412(5)(B), and that the Act prescribes that disruptive children are to be transferred to more restrictive placements only if and when their education significantly impairs the education of other children. Appellate counsel particularly criticizes S.T.\u2019s disposition where the court had no record of whether her child study team recommended that S.T. return to the current placement and whether modification of her I.E.P. would foster her development.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Counsel also relies on 29 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 794 <em>et seq. </em>(the Rehabilitation Act).</p>\n<p id=\"b637-6\">We have noted that the bulk of S.T.\u2019s claim relates to the disposition she received. This is particularly significant because the State\u2019s October 11, 1988 brief concerning S.T.\u2019s August 6, 1986 disposition conceded S.T. should have a new disposition hearing, saying,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b637-7\">Upon careful reading of the Education For All Handicapped Children act (EAHCA), 20 <em>U.S.C. </em>1400 <em>et. seq. </em>and the defendant\u2019s thorough brief, the State agrees that this case should be remanded for resentencing. Although S.T. was deemed an emotionally disturbed child, there was no determination as to whether this would qualify her as handicapped, and <em>if </em>she is handicapped, whether her conduct was a result of her handicap.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b637-8\">It should be noted that the EAHCA deals with a person\u2019s right to a free public education. It does not provide a defense to assault or unlawful possession of weapons. Thus, S.T.\u2019s conviction should be affirmed. This case should <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>be remanded for resentencing. The new sentence should comply with the procedural safeguards provided by the Handicapped Act, The Rehabilitation Act, 29 <em>\u00dc.S.C. </em>794, and <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:4A-44c(2).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b638-5\">Although the prosecutor ultimately conceded that a new disposition hearing was required for S.T., her parole was completed by the time her appellate brief was filed. Not only is the disposition of this appeal moot, <em>see Cain v. New Jersey State Parole Board, </em>78 <em>N.J. </em>253, 255 (1978); <em>New Jersey State Parole Board v. Boulden, </em>156 <em>N.J.Super. </em>494, 496 (App.Div. 1978); <em>State v. Middleton, </em>156 <em>N.J.Super. </em>548, 551 (App.Div. 1978); <em>see also Brown v. Yeldell, </em>487 <em>F.2d </em>1210, 1212 (D.C. Cir.1973), but, by the time the case was calendared before us, S.T. had received another dispositional hearing on new charges.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> We cannot remand the matter in 1989 for a Family Part judge to decide whether McCorkle was the least restrictive alternative for S.T. in August of 1986 even if that would have been the appropriate disposition had the application been brought before us in an expeditious manner.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-6\">We write because the mootness of this appeal illustrates certain inadequacies which we fear exist in the appellate process in cases involving juveniles. There is no rule which mandates acceleration of juvenile appeals.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b638-7\">The progress of an appeal depends to a great extent on counsel. <em>R. </em>1:2-5 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b638-8\">In the scheduling of cases for trial, hearing or argument, the following classes of actions shall be given preference:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b639-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>(1) all contested matters where a principal issue is the custody, status, welfare and protection of minors; criminal and quasi-criminal cases____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b639-6\">Notices of appeal provide a place to designate the applicability of this rule. <em>R. </em>2:6 \u2014 l(f)l, Appendix <em>IV. </em>Original defense counsel checked the box indicating that the rule was not applicable.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b639-7\">There are other applicable appellate rules relating to motions, including a motion to accelerate, <em>see R. </em>2:8-1;<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> motion for summary disposition, <em>R. </em>2:8 \u2014 3(b); motion to remand the matter to the Family Part, <em>R. </em>2:9-l(a); <em>R. </em>2:8-1. Where the primary appellate challenge is to a disposition, counsel should move to place the appeal on the sentencing calendar, and then move to file a brief, if necessary.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b639-8\">In a criminal, quasi-criminal or juvenile action in the Appellate Division in which the only issue on appeal is whether the court imposed a proper sentence, briefs shall not be filed without leave of court and the matter shall be placed on a sentencing calendar for consideration by the court following oral argument. The appellate court at its discretion may direct the removal of any case from the sentencing calendar. <em>[R. </em>2:9-11]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b639-9\">In any of the above motions, as well as in a motion for release pending appeal, <em>cf. R. </em>2:9-4, or for stay pending appeal, <em>R. </em>2:9-5, temporary emergency relief may be sought from a single appellate judge. <em>R. </em>2:9-8.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-10\">Juveniles are entitled in relevant part to the full protection of the law applicable to criminal defendants, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:4A-40; <em>In re </em>Gault, 387 <em>U.S. </em>1, 87 <em>S.Ct. </em>1428, 18 L.Ed.2d 527 (1967), which means a complete appellate process. That process, however, should not occasion a delay which defeats the purpose. <em>Cf. State in the Interest of C.B., </em>173 <em>N.J.Super. </em>424, 430 (App.Div.1980), certif. den. 84 <em>N.J. </em>482 (1980). Delinquency <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number>trials are swiftly held and dispositions swiftly executed. <em>Ibid.</em><footnotemark><em>16</em></footnotemark><em> </em>In light of the evident seriousness of S.T.\u2019s problems, we cannot conclude that the remand agreed on by counsel would have benefited S.T., even if applied for in a timely manner. Nonetheless, given the potentially irreparable harm in delay, where applicable, particularized motions to accelerate should be made in all appeals from delinquency dispositions as a matter of course.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-5\">The adjudication of delinquency is affirmed, except for the required mergers previously noted. The orders of disposition are remanded to the Family Part to eliminate the separate dispositions on FJ-06-3104-86A and FJ-06-939-86A which merged with other dispositions and to reduce the custodial term of FJ-06-936-86A to six months.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b631-14\"> ln the record the training school to which S.T. was committed is variously described as \u201cJamesburg\u201d or \u201cSkillman.\u201d These references are to names of places. By <em>N.J.S.A. </em>30:lB-8, effective November 30, 1988, the applicable training school has been redesignated the Lloyd McCorkle Training School for Boys and Girls. We thus refer to it here as McCorkle.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b631-15\">Although the order of disposition provides for a fourth degree simple assault, the maximum offense under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:12-la(l) is disorderly persons.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b632-7\"> FJ-06-3104-86A should have merged with FJ-06-937-86A and FJ-06-93986A should have merged with FJ-06-938-86A. Nor was there authority to have entered a custodial term of over six months in FJ-06-936-86A, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:4A-44d(l)(g). These errors are not raised on appeal and should be corrected on S.T.\u2019s record.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b632-10\">The original complaint apparently charged S.T. with aggravated assault in the second degree <em>(N.J.S.A. </em>2C:12-lb(l)). The court allowed the State to amend the complaint to simple assault which was aggravated because S.T. assaulted a teacher. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:12-lb(5)(d). That action is not appealed from.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b632-11\">The pre-disposition report erroneously indicates that S.T. said she pleaded guilty to some of these charges. She was tried and found guilty of all of them.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b633-11\"> 0n October 11, 1988, the State filed a notice of motion to file this brief <em>nunc pro tunc </em>which was granted November 15, 1988.

The only brief evaluation of S.T.\u2019s educational needs recorded in this appeal was done at McCorkle on October 4, 1985.
