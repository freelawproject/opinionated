The order under review denies K.D. and C.D. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>visitation \u201cin the best interest of the child,\u201d but grants E.D., the natural mother, limited visitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-4\">The infant K.D. was bom July 5, 1986 to E.D. and K.D., who were not married. Soon after the infant\u2019s birth, DYFS was notified of the hospital\u2019s concern that the mother could not care for her child, as E.D. was homeless and had recently been discharged from a methadone maintenance program on suspicion of illegal drug use. The child was born drug addicted. DYFS established immediate supervision with the mother and infant. After several months the two moved to the mother\u2019s grandmother\u2019s home. The DYFS worker who visited the home noticed that E.D. frequently appeared to be under the influence of drugs.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-5\">During the fall of 1986, E.D. was incarcerated, and her grandmother cared for the infant. In November 1986, when the infant was hospitalized with bronchitis, his mother visited and began screaming in an hysterical and delusional manner, reportedly under the influence of drugs which she had taken in the hospital bathroom. Her counsel conceded that because of her addiction she was unable to care for the infant as of the time of the initial Family Part hearing. DYFS moved for an order giving it custody of the infant. DYFS was granted custody, and the infant was placed with foster parents.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-6\">The infant\u2019s mother informed the trial court that she wanted her brother and his wife, R.D. and N.D., to have custody of the infant. They live in South Carolina, but came to New Jersey for the hearing. At the time of the hearing, R.D. was finishing his last year of studies to be a doctor of chiropractic medicine. He and his wife stated that they wanted to obtain custody of the infant. R.D. maintained that he wanted the infant to have a \u201cnormal life,\u201d and that if the court granted visitation to either the infant\u2019s mother or father or any other paternal relatives, he would not comply with the court order. R.D. and N.D. have one child of their own. R.D. asserted that he and his wife intend to maintain custody of the infant K.D. for six months, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>and then file for adoption pursuant to South Carolina law. A DYFS worker stated at trial that it was the intention of DYFS to maintain supervision of the child for six months, after which time the file would be closed and the South Carolina \u201csister\u201d office would take control.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-5\">K.D., the infant\u2019s father, was present at the hearing but did not testify. Although he was then and continues to be an inmate in state prison, his attorney stated that it was his client\u2019s desire to maintain custody of the infant. Appellant C.D., the 74-year old paternal grandmother of the infant K.D., intervened in the Family Part action, requesting that she be granted custody of the infant. She and her daughter, D.D., live in a two bedroom apartment in New Brunswick. D.D. was 52-years old at the time of the hearing and worked two jobs; full-time as a university secretary, and part-time, some evenings and weekends, at a local toy store.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-6\">Under the trial court order, the infant has been living with the maternal uncle and aunt in South Carolina since January 1988. The order permits visitation by the mother E.D. one day per month.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-7\">Appellants contend that DYFS\u2019 plan to monitor the infant K.D. for six months and then to close the file amounts to termination of the rights of the infant\u2019s parents in violation of New Jersey law, as DYFS has been granted custody of the child on a temporary basis only and no proceeding to terminate the parents\u2019 rights has been instituted. The State submits that placement of the infant K.D. with its South Carolina relatives was in the best interest of the child, and that appellants\u2019 arguments are misplaced as the proceeding, as stated repeatedly during the course of trial, was only \u201cfor a determination as to with whom custody of the minor should be placed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b437-8\">DYFS may place a child who is in its custody in the custody of a relative. <em>See N.J.S.A. </em>9:6-8.54. There is no restriction that the child be placed only with relatives within the jurisdiction of this state. We must, however, be concerned with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>whether the court\u2019s order, in granting legal custody of the infant to DYFS and physical custody to the maternal relatives in South Carolina, might act as a <em>de facto </em>termination of, or infringement upon, the parental rights of E.D. and K.D..</p>\n<p id=\"b438-5\">Therefore, we first examine whether the South Carolina courts would have jurisdiction over R.D. and N.D.\u2019s proposed adoption of the infant. The Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction Act (UCCJA) has been adopted by both New Jersey and South Carolina. <em>See N.J.S.A. </em>2A:34-28 <em>et seq.; S.C.Code Ann. </em>\u00a7 20-7-782 <em>et seq. </em>(Law. Co-op 1976). The Parental Kidnapping Prevention Act of 1980 (PKPA) governs all states. 28 <em>U.S. C.A. </em>\u00a7 1738A (West Supp.1989). The UCCJA seeks to introduce certainty and stability in the choice of forum in interstate custody disputes and to encourage interstate cooperation in the interest of the child. <em>E.E.B. v. D.A., </em>89 <em>N.J. </em>595, 603 (1982), <em>cert. </em>den. 459 <em>U.S. </em>1210, 103 <em>S.Ct. </em>1203, 75 L.Ed.2d 445, reh\u2019g den. 460 <em>US. </em>1104, 103 <em>S.Ct. </em>1806, 76 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>369 (1983). \u201cWhile UCCJA focuses on custody disputes between family members, its operative provisions are broad enough to include a dispute between a natural parent and adoptive parents.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 607. While one of the purposes of PKPA is to deter interstate abduction of children by contesting parents in custody disputes, it applies as well \u201cto disputes between all persons who seek custody of a child.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 603 citing <em>Pub.L. No. </em>96-611, \u00a7 7, 94 Stat. 3568.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-6\">The adoption of the infant K.D. by his maternal uncle and aunt would constitute a modification of the February 10, 1988 order that the infant \u201cshall remain in the legal custody of the New Jersey Division of Youth and Family Services, with physical custody of the minor being placed with the maternal uncle and aunt, [R.D. and N.D.], in South Carolina____\u201d Both PKPA and UCCJA prohibit modification of a child custody order unless the revising forum has jurisdiction, and the state that rendered the original order has lost jurisdiction or has declined to exercise it. <em>E.E.B. </em>89 <em>N.J. </em>at 611; <em>compare </em>28 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 1738A(f) (West Supp.1989) with <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:34-42a. Two or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>more states cannot have concurrent jurisdiction to modify a court order under UCCJA. <em>Neger v. Neger, </em>93 <em>N.J. </em>15, 29 (1983). <em>But see Bowden v. Bowden, </em>182 <em>N.J. Super. </em>307, 313-14 (App.Div.1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b439-6\">South Carolina would have jurisdiction over the infant K.D. as the UCCJA provides that a state has jurisdiction over a child if it is the child\u2019s home state. <em>S.C.Code Ann. </em>\u00a7 20-7-788(a)(l)(i) (Law. Co-op 1976); <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:34-31a(l)(i). Jurisdiction in South Carolina is reinforced by reason of the fact that \u201cthe child and at least one contestant [the maternal uncle and aunt], have a significant connection with [South Carolina] and ... there is available in [South Carolina] substantial evidence concerning the child\u2019s present or future care, protection, training and personal relationships____\u201d <em>S.C.Code Ann. </em>\u00a7 20-7-788(a)(2) (Law. Co-op 1976); <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:34-31a(2). Nonetheless, the order under review may be modified by South Carolina only if its courts determine that New Jersey has lost jurisdiction or has declined to exercise it. <em>See E.E.B., </em>89 <em>N.J. </em>at 611.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-9\">The New Jersey courts have placed the infant in the physical custody of his maternal uncle and aunt after being told that it is their intention to adopt the child in South Carolina after six months\u2019 time has elapsed, and that New Jersey DYFS intends to close the case file on the child after a six-month period. There is a distinct possibility under these circumstances that South Carolina courts would feel confident that New Jersey had relinquished jurisdiction of the child, and therefore feel free to amend the trial court\u2019s order and permit the adoption of the infant by residents of South Carolina.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-10\">We cannot agree with the contention of DYFS that in a South Carolina proceeding E.D. and K.D. are guaranteed the same protections they are entitled to in New Jersey against termination of their parental rights. If the maternal aunt and uncle move to adopt the infant in South Carolina, the child\u2019s parents, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>to effectively defend against the action, would be required to go to that state.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-5\">Pursuant to South Carolina law, prior to adoption of a child, consent or relinquishment of parental rights is required of</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ao0\">the father of a child bom when the father was not married to the child\u2019s mother, if the child was placed with the prospective adoptive parents more than six months after the child\u2019s birth, but only if the father has maintained substantial and continuous or repeated contact with the child as demonstrated by:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b440-6\">(a) payment by the father toward the support of the child of a fair and reasonable sum, based on the father\u2019s financial ability; and either</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b440-7\">(b) visits by the father to the child at least monthly when the father is physically and financially able to do so, and when the father is not prevented from doing so by the person or agency having lawful custody of the child; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b440-8\">(c) regular communication by the father with the child or with the person or agency having lawful custody of the child, when the father is physically and financially unable to visit the child, or when the father is prevented from visiting the child by the person or agency having lawful custody of the child.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b440-9\">The subjective intent of the father, if unsupported by evidence of the acts specified in subitems (a), (b), and (c) of this item (4) of subsection (A) of this section, does not preclude a determination that the father failed to maintain substantial and continuous or repeated contact with the child. In making this determination, the court may not require a showing of diligent efforts by any person or agency having lawful custody of the child to encourage the father to perform the acts. <em>[S.C.Code Ann. </em>\u00a7 20-7-1690(A)(4) (Law. Co-op 1976)].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b440-10\">Thus, in South Carolina it is legally permissible to adopt a child even if no consent has been given by a natural father, whose rights have not been terminated. \u201c[T]he mother of a child born when the mother was not married,\u201d however, absent the termination of her parental rights, must give her consent or relinquish her parental rights prior to the adoption of that child. <em>S.C.Code Ann. </em>\u00a7 20-7-1690(A)(3) (Law. Co-op 1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b440-11\">In New Jersey, without a valid termination of parental rights, there can be no adoption of the child. <em>Matter of Baby M, </em>109 <em>N.J. </em>396, 428 (1988), citing <em>In re Adoption of Children by D., </em>61 <em>N.J. </em>89, 95 (1972); <em>see In re Adoption of Two Children by A.M. and L.M., </em>170 <em>N.J. Super. </em>320, 328 (App.Div.1979). Placement of a child with foster parents does not give the foster parents the right to adopt the children entrusted to them. <em>A.M. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number><em>and L.M., </em>170 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 328. \u201cThe mere conclusion by DYFS that parental rights ought to be terminated does not <em>per se </em>entitle it to authorize or approve the institution of adoption proceedings by the foster parents.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 330. We find no discernible difference in the dangers to be guarded against between adopting a child prior to a valid termination of parental rights and permitting adoption of a child, albeit in a different state, with no proceeding to terminate the rights of both parents, as could result in the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-5\">In both New Jersey and in South Carolina the father of the child must receive notice of the adoption proceedings, even if in South Carolina he has been adjudged to have \u201cabandoned\u201d the child pursuant to <em>S. C. Code Ann. </em>\u00a7 20-7-1690(A)(4) (Law. Co-op 1976). <em>See S.C.Code Ann. </em>\u00a7 20-7-1734(B) (Law. Co-op 1976); <em>N.J.S.A. </em>9:3-45. However, even if a South Carolina court were to determine that termination of the father\u2019s parental rights was required, the father would not have an automatic right to counsel in the termination proceedings. <em>S.C.Code Ann. </em>\u00a7 20-7-1570 (Law. Co-op 1976) provides, in relevant part, \u201c[i]f the parent is not represented by counsel [in a termination proceeding], the judge shall make a determination on a case by case basis whether counsel is required.\u201d In New Jersey counsel must be provided \u201cwithout cost to indigent parents who are subjected to proceedings which may result in either temporary loss of custody or permanent termination of their parental rights. Simple justice demands nothing less in light of the magnitude of the consequences involved.\u201d <em>Crist v. N.J. Div. Youth &amp; Family Services, </em>135 <em>N.J.Super. </em>573, 575 (App.Div. 1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b441-6\">We find that important differences exist in the approach of the two states in the area of the adoption of children. South Carolina permits the adoption of a child without a separate termination of the rights of the unwed father. New Jersey requires that the parents\u2019 rights be terminated in order for adoption to be effected. New Jersey requires that counsel be provided the parents for the termination proceedings, while <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>South Carolina does not. Allowing the child to be adopted in South Carolina without guaranteeing that termination of the rights of the New Jersey parents will be during a proceeding where the parents are afforded substantially the same rights they would have in this State offends the strong public policy of New Jersey. <em>See Matter of Baby M, </em>109 <em>N.J. </em>at 428. Since South Carolina does not provide the procedural protections that are available in New Jersey, such as the necessity for termination of the father\u2019s rights prior to adoption of the child by third parties, and the guarantee of counsel in all cases, New Jersey should retain jurisdiction of any proceeding to terminate parental rights so long as the parents remain in New Jersey. The order of the Family Part must be amended to insure that the intention of the New Jersey courts to retain jurisdiction is made clear.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-4\">We need not determine whether the New Jersey statutory criteria under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>30:4015, regarding termination of parental rights, has been met in the present case. No mention was made at the hearing below of terminating the parental rights of E.D. or K.D.. It was stated that the purpose of the hearing was not to terminate parental rights. <em>See N.J.S.A. </em>30:4017; 30:4020. As stated by the trial judge on C.D.\u2019s motion for reconsideration, \u201cthe entire proceeding was a custody proceeding and I concerned myself with the custody aspects and what is for the best interest of the child.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b442-5\">Nor should we involve ourselves in such a determination at this time. \u201c \u2018The warmth and complexity of such relationships should not be assessed against the typed words of a cold record.\u2019 \u201d <em>New Jersey Div. of Youth and Family Services v. A.W., </em>103 <em>N.J. </em>591, 617 (1986), quoting <em>In re Michael B., </em>58 N.Y.2d 71, 75, 459 N.Y.S.2d 254, 256, 445 N.E.2d 637, 639 (Cooke, C.J., concurring), reargument den. 58 <em>N.</em>Y.2d 1114, 462 <em>N.Y.S.2d </em>1029, 449 N.E.2d 746 (1983). A factually sensitive issue, such as termination of parental rights, which was not addressed at trial, should not be determined <em>de novo </em>by an appellate court. <em>See Matter of Baby M, </em>109 <em>N.J. </em>at 463.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>Appellant C.D. cites <em>N.J.S.A. </em>10:5-3 in support of her contention that the trial court impermissibly considered her age of 74 years in determining the custody of the infant K.D.. This statute declares, in relevant part,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b443-6\">[t]he Legislature finds and declares that practices of discrimination against any of its inhabitants, because of race, creed, color, national origin, ancestry, age, sex, marital status, liability for service in the Armed Forces of the United States, or nationality, are a matter of concern to the government of the State, and that such discrimination threatens not only the rights and proper privileges of the inhabitants of the State but menaces the institutions and foundation of a free democratic State____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b443-7\">We have previously considered the significance of the age of an applicant for custody of a child. <em>See J. and E. v. M. and F., </em>157 <em>N.J.Super. </em>478, 494 (App.Div.), certif. den. 77 <em>N.J. </em>490 (1978). The trial court\u2019s denial of C.D.\u2019s motion for custody of the infant here was not \u201cmade solely on the basis of her age,\u201d as she contends. The trial judge stated in his opinion,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b443-8\">[C.D]. is seventy-four years old. Her health is not that good. In fact, she testified to a heart condition. Her testimony also indicated to me that she is a dedicated mother who would accept her son, [K.D.], back into her home upon his release from prison. Her dedication as a mother and her ability to forgive her son are admirable qualities indeed. However, by minimizing her son\u2019s drug activities, and in view of her age and health, it is my conclusion that she would not be able to ensure the safety and physical and moral welfare of the infant. It is for these reasons that I cannot grant custody of the infant to [C.D.].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b443-9\">Therefore, it is not necessary to determine her contention that \u201cage, alone, is not appropriately to be considered as a disqualifying factor in determinations of foster care placement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b443-10\">C.D. also contends that the findings of the trial judge are not founded upon sufficient credible evidence in the record. A trial court\u2019s determination regarding custody should be affirmed if</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b443-11\">the findings made could reasonably have been reached on sufficient credible evidence present in the record. When the reviewing court is satisfied that the findings and result meet this criterion, its task is complete and it should not disturb the result, even though it has the feeling it might have reached a different conclusion were it the trial tribunal. <em>[Beck v. Beck, </em>86 <em>N.J. </em>480, 496 (1981), quoting <em>State v. Johnson, </em>42 <em>N.J. </em>146, 161-62 (1964)].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b443-12\"><em>See also Matter of Baby M, </em>109 <em>N.J. </em>at 457. \u201cIn considering all the circumstances upon which the child\u2019s best interests hinge, a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>trial court judge has the opportunity to become fully immersed in the details of the case, and his opinion will be given great weight on appeal.\u201d <em>Palermo v. Palermo, </em>164 <em>N.J.Super. </em>492, 498 (App.Div.1978). The trial court\u2019s determination that C.D. should not be granted custody of her grandchild, on the basis of her age, her health and because she would not keep her son K.D. from the child if granted custody was reasonably made on sufficient credible evidence in the record and may not be disturbed.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-4\">C.D. argues that whether she would allow her son back into her household after his release from prison is not relevant \u201cas any determination of the father\u2019s ability to have contact with his son when he is released from prison must be made at a later date, and is thus not a proper consideration in determining whether C.D. should be granted temporary custody at this time.\u201d While <em>N.J.S.A. </em>30:4012 contemplates a temporary separation of a child from his natural parents, the 6-month limitation upon the duration of the custody order may be extended. <em>See A.M. and L.M., </em>170 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 328. The foster care of the infant K.D. has been of an extended nature. His father is incarcerated as a repeat drug offender and is a drug abuser. His mother is unable to care for him due to her drug addiction. K.D. was denied visitation with his infant son by the trial court, a determination that was not appealed. The issue of whether C.D. would be able to keep her son K.D. from her apartment if she had custody of the infant K.D. was thus relevant to the court\u2019s inquiry.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-5\">C.D. also complains that various areas of cross-examination were erroneously denied her by the trial judge. This contention is clearly without merit. <em>R. </em>2:ll-3(e)(l)(E).</p>\n<p id=\"b444-6\">C.D., K.D. and E.D. assert that the trial court\u2019s admission of the home evaluation of the maternal uncle and aunt, prepared by the Spartanburg County Department of Social Services in South Carolina, constituted reversible error. The trial court admitted the South Carolina home evaluation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>through a New Jersey DYFS worker under <em>Evid.R. </em>63(15) which provides, in relevant part,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b445-6\">a statement is admissible if in the form of ... a written statement of an act done, or an act, condition or event observed by a public official if it was within the scope of his duty either to perform the act reported or to observe the act, condition or event reported and to make the written statement____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b445-7\">A public official of a state or territory of the United States is defined in <em>Evid.R. </em>62(3) as including \u201can official of a political subdivision or regional or other agency of [a] state or territory and of a municipality.\u201d However, the scope of the materials allowed under <em>Evid.R. </em>63(15) is too narrow to permit the admission of the entire report prepared by the Spartanburg County agency.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-8\">DYFS reports have previously been admitted pursuant to <em>Evid.R. </em>63(13). <em>See In re Cope, </em>106 <em>N.J.Super. </em>336, 343 (App.Div.1969); <em>R. </em>5:12-4(d). In order for a report to be admissible under <em>EvidR. </em>63(13),</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b445-9\">[f]irst, the writing must be made in the regular course of business. Second, it must be prepared within a short time of the act, condition or event being described. Finally, the source of the information and the method and circumstances of the preparation of the writing must justify allowing it into evidence. <em>[State v. Matulewiez, </em>101 <em>N.J. </em>27, 29 (1985), citing <em>State v. Hudes, </em>128 <em>N.J.Super. </em>589, 594 (Cty.Ct.1974) ].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b445-10\">As the South Carolina social services worker did not testify at the hearing, and thus no information was available concerning the preparation of the report, there was insufficient foundation for its admission under <em>Evid.R. </em>63(13). But, compare <em>W. W. v. I.M., </em>231 <em>N.J.Super. </em>495, 502-04 (App.Div.1989), where reports of the Children\u2019s Psychiatric Center (CPC) were held admissible in a custody proceeding as DYFS reports, pursuant to <em>R. </em>5:12-4(d), <em>N.J.S.A. </em>9:6-8.46, and <em>N.J.S.A. </em>9:6-8.10a. However, the majority in <em>W. W. </em>did not address the issue of whether there was proper foundation for the admission of the reports, but only whether the reports should be admissible in a proceeding instituted not by DYFS but by a private party. <em>Id. </em>at 504. <em>R. </em>5:12-4(d) provides that \u201c[t]he Division of Youth and Family Services shall be permitted to submit into evidence, pursuant to Evidence Rules 63(13) and 62(5), reports by staff personnel or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>professional consultants. Conclusions drawn from the facts stated therein shall be treated as prima facie evidence, subject to rebuttal.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b446-5\"><em>N.J.S.A. </em>9:6-8.46 provides, in relevant part,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b446-6\">[i]n any hearing under this act ... any writing, record or photograph, whether in the form of an entry in a book or otherwise, made as a memorandum or record of any condition, act, transaction, occurrence or event relating to a child in an abuse or neglect proceeding of any hospital or any other public or private institution or agency shall be admissible in evidence in proof of that condition, act, transaction, occurrence or event, if the judge finds that it was made in the regular course of the business of any hospital or any other public or private institution or agency, and that it was in the regular course of such business to make it, at the time of the condition, act, transaction, occurrence or event, or within a reasonable time thereafter, shall be prima facie evidence of the facts contained in such certification. A certification by someone other than the head of the hospital or agency shall be accompanied by a photocopy of a delegation of authority signed by both the head of the hospital or agency and by such other employees. All other circumstances of the making of the memorandum, record or photograph, including lack of personal knowledge of the making, may be proved to affect its weight, but they shall not affect its admissibility____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b446-7\">In the present case, as no evidence was presented that the South Carolina report was prepared in the regular course of business, it is not admissible pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>9:6-8.46. In addition, it is questionable whether an examination of a prospective custodial parent\u2019s home in another state is within the scope intended by the statutory reference to \u201cany condition, act, transaction, occurrence or event relating to a child in an abuse or neglect proceeding____\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>9:6-8.46.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-9\">Finally, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>9:6-8.10a(b)(6) provides that all information obtained by DYFS in investigating reports of child abuse shall be kept confidential, but may be released to \u201c[a] court, upon its finding that access to such records may be necessary for determination of an issue before the court____\u201d As noted by the dissent in <em>W. W, </em>however, this provision \u201cdoes not deal with the admissibility of evidence at a trial. Rather, it provides an exception to the general rule established by <em>N.J.S.A. </em>9:6-8.10a of confidentiality of DYFS records and reports.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 524 (Skillman, J.A.D., dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b447-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>Improper admission of evidence does not automatically mandate reversal. At the hearing for appellant C.D.\u2019s motion for a stay of the order, the trial judge stated regarding the South Carolina home study of the maternal uncle and aunt:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b447-6\">That was only a very minor factor. The most important thing that convinced me was the testimony of these people coming up here from South Carolina. That is \u2014 maybe I should have been more explicit in my opinion, however, the fact that they came up here from South Carolina, the fact that they wanted this child, the fact that as I stated before the aunt saying I will take him regardless of if he has AIDS or not, having a child of her own. The fact that [E.D.] tells \u2014 told me under oath that I want my child to have a chance, give him to my brother. Those are things that entered into the Court\u2019s \u2014 of course, the fact that there was a home study done in South Carolina was significant, wasn\u2019t as significant as the testimony was for the best interest of the child, counselor.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b447-7\">As the trial court relied mainly on the testimony presented below and not the home report, and as the parties had the ability to directly interrogate the relatives concerning the home in South Carolina, reversal on this ground is not warranted. <em>See In re Hoffman, </em>53 <em>N.J.Super. </em>396, 401-02 (App.Div.1959); <em>see also Armstrong v. Francis Corp., </em>20 <em>N.J. </em>320, 325 (1956).</p>\n<p id=\"b447-8\">C.D. urges that, if she is denied custody, this court \u201cshould reverse the decision of the trial judge regarding visitation and exercise its authority of original jurisdiction to grant her liberal visitation.\u201d DYFS contends that the decision of the trial court to deny C.D. visitation with the infant K.D. was not in error, \u201cas there has been minimal contact between the paternal grandmother and the minor, there is no meaningful relationship between them, and any visitation will cause disruption to the family unit in South Carolina where the minor now lives.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b447-9\">Our Supreme Court stated in <em>Mimkon v. Ford, </em>66 <em>N.J. </em>426, 437 (1975):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b447-10\">It is biological fact that grandparents are bound to their grandchildren by the unbreakable links of heredity. It is common human experience that the concern and interest grandparents take in the welfare of their grandchildren far exceeds anything explicable in purely biological terms. A very special relationship often arises and continues between grandparents and grandchildren. The tensions and conflicts which commonly mar relations between parents and children are often absent between those very same parents and their grandchil<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>dren. Visits with a grandparent are often a precious part of a child\u2019s experience and there are benefits which devolve upon the grandchild from the relationship with his grandparents which he cannot derive from any other relationship. Neither the Legislature nor this Court is blind to human truths which grandparents and grandchildren have always known.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b448-5\">At common law a grandparent\u2019s right to visitation could rise no higher than that of the natural parent. <em>J. and E. v. M. and F, </em>157 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 494; <em>D.Y.F.S. v. D.T. and J.T., </em>171 <em>N.J.Super. </em>520, 524 (Cty.Ct.1979). However, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>9:2-7.1 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b448-6\">Where either or both of the parents of a minor child, residing within the State, is or are deceased, or divorced or living separate and apart in different habitats, regardless of the existence of a court order or agreement, a grandparent or the grandparents of such child, who is or are the parents of such deceased, separated or divorced parent or parents, or any sibling of the child may apply to the Superior Court, in accordance with the Rules of Court, to have such child brought before such court; and the court may make such order or judgment, as the best interest of the child may require, for visitation rights for such grandparent, grandparents or sibling in respect to such child.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b448-7\">Thus, contrary to common law principles, under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>9:2-7.1, \u201c[w]here grandparents have a direct, personal relationship with the grandchild, their rights are found independent of the parents\u2019 rights.\u201d <em>Youth &amp; Family Services Div. v. Torres, </em>185 <em>N.J.Super. </em>234, 246-47 (Cty.Ct.1980), aff\u2019d 185 <em>N.J.Super. </em>182 (App.Div.1982). <em>N.J.S.A. </em>9:2-7.1 \u201ccreates a presumption that the best interests of the child ordinarily are served by maintaining their contact and communication with their grandparents.\u201d <em>Globman v. Globman, </em>158 <em>N.J.Super. </em>338, 345-46 (App.Div.), certif. den. 77 <em>N.J. </em>493 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b448-8\">Prior to DYFS\u2019 grant of custody of the infant K.D., from July to December 1986, C.D. had cared for her grandchild four or five times, for several days at a time. Although she was permitted by DYFS to see her grandchild only once per month for one hour each visit, the trial court denied her visitation in December 1987, and she thus has not seen her grandchild for approximately 16 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-9\">Our Supreme Court in <em>Matter of Baby M </em>stated,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b449-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>[w]e disagree with the premise, however, that in determining custody a court should decide what the child\u2019s best interests <em>would be </em>if some hypothetical state of facts had existed. Rather, we must look to what those best interests <em>are, today, </em>even if some of the facts may have resulted in part from legal error. The child\u2019s interests come first: we will not punish it for judicial errors, assuming any were made. (Citation omitted). [109 <em>N.J. </em>at 456; emphasis in original].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b449-6\">Clearly C.D. does not presently have a direct, personal relationship with the child. Our review should not be broadened to consider whether she would have had such a relationship if she had been granted more liberal visitation by DYFS, and/or visitation by the trial court. <em>See ibid..</em></p>\n<p id=\"b449-7\">C.D.\u2019s lack of a \u201cdirect, personal relationship\u201d with her grandchild, regardless of the reason, gives rise to no independent right to visitation. <em>See Torres, </em>185 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 246-47. The finding of the trial court that visitations should be denied \u201ccould reasonably have been reached on sufficient credible evidence present in the record,\u201d <em>Matter of Baby M, </em>109 <em>N.J. </em>at 457, quoting <em>Beck, </em>86 <em>N.J. </em>at 496, and is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-8\">We affirm and remand for the entry of an order by the Family Part which will make it clear that New Jersey is retaining jurisdiction of the case.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
