The issue arises in the context of charges of sexual assault against <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>defendant by his minor daughters, who subsequently have had confidential communications with a court appointed law guardian representing them in civil proceedings initiated by the Division of Youth and Family Services (DYFS). We conclude that defendant has no constitutional right to breach the confidentiality of the attorney-client privilege under these circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-5\">On October 12, 1987, defendant\u2019s wife, Linda, disclosed to DYFS a letter from her daughter, L.P., which asserted that defendant had made her \u201cgo to his room\u201d and \u201cdo things [she] wasn\u2019t supposed to do.\u201d Thereafter, DYFS, in conjunction with local law enforcement officials, conducted a series of interviews with the defendant, Linda, L.P. and another of defendant\u2019s daughters, K.P. L.P., then age twelve, recounted how defendant forced her to have sexual intercourse and oral sex with him over a period of three or four years. K.P., then age fifteen, revealed that defendant rubbed \u201chis crotch\u201d against her thigh when she was ten or eleven years old.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-6\">Defendant admitted having sexual intercourse with two of his daughters from a previous marriage. He also admitted rubbing his penis against L.P.\u2019s vagina, but he denied any penetration. Defendant denied having any sexual contact with K.P.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-7\">Defendant was indicted by a Monmouth County Grand Jury on February 23, 1988. The first and second counts of the indictment charge defendant with aggravated sexual assault and sexual assault upon L.P., contrary to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:14-2a and <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:14-2b. The fourth count charges defendant with endangering the welfare of L.P., contrary to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:24-4a. The third and fifth counts charge defendant with sexual assault upon K.P. and endangering the welfare of K.P. As a condition of bail, defendant moved from the family home and agreed to have no contact with his children.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-8\">According to DYFS, Linda repeatedly questioned the truthfulness of L.P. and K.P.\u2019s allegations against defendant. In fact, Linda, who was assisting in the preparation of the de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>fense, seemed to be hampering the criminal investigation by restricting the prosecutor\u2019s access to her daughters. Moreover, Linda rebuffed DYFS\u2019 efforts to secure counseling or therapy for the girls. At some point, both daughters recanted their allegations against defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-5\">Subsequently, DYFS filed a verified complaint seeking to place L.P., K.P. and defendant\u2019s son, E.P., under its care and supervision. The complaint was accompanied by an order to show cause assigning a law guardian for the minor children.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Upon her appointment, the law guardian sent a letter to the minors which stated in part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-6\">I would like to introduce myself. <em>I am the court appointed attorney who mil represent you in the Court action involving D.Y.F.S. </em>I am called your law guardian. My job is to speak with you and find out what your wishes are and tell those wishes to the Judge. I must also protect your interest in the Court case. I work for you \u2014 not your parents \u2014 and not D.Y.F.S. <em>Anything you and I discuss is CONFIDENTIAL, which means I cannot discuss it with anyone without your permission. </em>[Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b523-7\">A hearing was held on September 23, 1988 which resulted in an order placing L.P., K.P. and E.P. under DYFS\u2019 temporary care and supervision, ordering a family evaluation and restraining defendant from contacting the minors or visiting the family residence.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-8\">Subsequently, there was a flurry of correspondence between the law guardian and defendant\u2019s counsel, who represents him in both the criminal and civil actions. The law guardian advised defendant\u2019s counsel that she would not permit her to have contact with the children, except with the law guardian\u2019s consent. Thereafter, defendant\u2019s counsel requested \u201cmemorializations or copies of all interviews with the daughters ... concerning the alleged criminal contact on them by their father.\u201d The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>law guardian responded that \u201c[n]o materials will be provided to you as such matters are privileged.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b524-5\">On October 11, 1988, defendant filed motions in the criminal case to compel DYFS and the law guardian to release all records relating to interviews with L.P. and K.P. Defendant\u2019s motion seeking release of the law guardian\u2019s notes was supported by his attorney\u2019s affidavit which stated in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Au\">[O]n information and belief, the victims have on several occasions made many statements indicating that the original complaints to the police were untruthful.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AP1\">This would be exculpatory material held by a governmental agency to which defendant is entitled under <em>Brady. </em>Therefore, defendant requests that the ... Law Guardian ... be compelled to release any and all records of interviews with the victims along with any notes of unmemorialized conversations with the victims wherein they indicated the original complaints to the police were lies.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b524-7\">In a reply brief, defendant agreed to an <em>in camera </em>inspection of the records to determine whether they contain \u201cany contradictory statements made by the girls which would affect their credibility at trial.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b524-8\">The trial court decided the motions in a one paragraph letter which stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-9\">This will advise you that I have again reviewed <em>[State v. Cusick, </em>219 <em>N.J. Super. </em>452 (App.Div.1987) and <em>Pennsylvania v. Ritchie, </em>480 <em>U.S. </em>39, 107 <em>S.Ct. </em>989, 94 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>40 (1987) ] and I am satisfied that the defendant\u2019s request to compel the Division of Youth and Family Services to release all records including interviews with the victims is warranted, and further, that the Office of the Public Advocate/Law Guardian should release all records concerning interviews with victims; therefore, all records are to be forwarded to this Court for an \u201cin camera\u201d inspection.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b524-10\">Accordingly, an order was entered on January 19, 1989, directing the law guardian to \u201crelease all records concerning interviews with the victims to the court for in-camera review to determine whether or not defendant\u2019s attorney is entitled to same.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b524-11\">We granted the law guardian\u2019s motion, on behalf of the children, for leave to appeal from this order and for a stay <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>pending appeal.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b525-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b525-7\">The threshold issue in this appeal is whether the law guardian and defendant\u2019s children occupy an attorney-client relationship in which their communications are protected by the attorney-client privilege.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-8\">The law guardian was appointed to represent the children pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>9:6-8.23(a), which provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-9\">Any minor who is the subject of a child abuse or neglect proceeding under this act must be represented by a law guardian to help protect his interests and to help express his wishes to the court.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b525-10\">In addition, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>9:6-8.21(d) states that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-11\">\u201cLaw Guardian\u201d means an attorney admitted to the practice of law in this State, regularly employed by the Department of Public Advocate, and designated under this act to represent minors in alleged cases of child abuse or neglect.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b525-12\">The fact that a law guardian must be admitted to the practice of law and is designated \u201cto represent\u201d children in the child abuse or neglect proceedings reflects a legislative intention that the law guardian will occupy the role of the attorney for the children. This conclusion is reinforced by other sections of Title 9 which specifically authorize a law guardian to perform the responsibilities of an attorney for a litigant. Thus, a law guardian is authorized to apply for an adjournment, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>9:6-8.48, and to file a motion to set aside, modify or vacate any order issued in the course of the proceedings. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>9:6-8.-59.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-13\">The conclusion that a law guardian occupies an attorney-client relationship with the alleged abused or neglected children is also supported by New York case law interpreting similar legislation enacted in that state. <em>See Bentley v. Bentley, </em>86 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>A.D.2d 926, 448 <em>N.Y.S.2d </em>559, 560 (App.Div.1982); <em>see also Child Neglect Laws in America, </em>9 <em>Fam.L.Q. </em>1, 31-33 (Table VI), 58-59 (1975) (reporting that as of 1975 more than half the states had adopted statutes authorizing the appointment of counsel for children involved in abuse or neglect proceedings).</p>\n<p id=\"b526-5\">Because a law guardian serves as the attorney for the alleged abused or neglected children, the attorney-client privilege applies to any communications made in the course of that representation. <em>In re Advisory Opinion No. </em>544 <em>of New Jersey Supreme Court Advisory Comm. on Professional Ethics, </em>103 <em>N.J. </em>399, 404 (1986). \u201c[T]he primary justification and dominant rationale\u201d for the attorney-client privilege is \u201cthe encouragement of free and full disclosure of information from the client to the attorney.\u201d <em>Fellerman v. Bradley, </em>99 <em>N.J. </em>493, 498 (1985). The opportunity for such \u201cfree and full disclosure\u201d of information has particular importance to abused or neglected children, due to their vulnerability and their vital interest in the outcome of proceedings which may alter or even terminate their relationship with their parents. Therefore, any communications between defendant\u2019s minor children and the law guardian relating to the acts of abuse defendant allegedly committed upon them are subject to the protection of the attorney-client privilege.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b527-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b527-6\">The attorney-client privilege, as codified in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:84A-20 and <em>Evidence Rule </em>26, extends to all \u201ccommunications between lawyer and his client in the course of that relationship and in professional confidence____\u201d The only three statutory exceptions to the privilege are</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b527-9\">(1) \u201ca communication in the course of legal service sought or obtained in aid of the commission of a crime or a fraud,\u201d <em>Evid.R. </em>26(2)(a); <em>see also RPC </em>1.6(b) and <em>RPC </em>1.6(c)(1);</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b527-10\">(2) \u201ca communication relevant to an issue between parties all of whom claim through the client, regardless of whether the respective claims are by testate or intestate succession or by inter vivos transaction,\u201d <em>Evid.R. </em>26(2)(b); and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b527-11\">(3) \u201ca communication relevant to an issue of breach of duty by the lawyer to his client, or by the client to his lawyer.\u201d <em>Evid.R. </em>26(2)(c); <em>see also RPC </em>1.6(c)(2).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b527-12\">Defendant concedes that none of the statutory exceptions to the attorney-client privileges apply to his children\u2019s communications with their attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-13\">Nevertheless, defendant argues, relying primarily upon <em>Pennsylvania v. Ritchie, </em>480 <em>U.S. </em>39, 107 <em>S.Ct. </em>989, 94 L.Ed.2d 40 (1987), that disclosure of those communications for <em>in camera </em>inspection is required because his children\u2019s attorney-client privilege must yield to his due process rights under the United States Constitution. In <em>Ritchie, </em>a defendant charged with the rape of his daughter sought the disclosure of the records of a Pennsylvania agency assigned the statutory responsibility, comparable to DYES, of investigating suspected cases of child abuse and neglect. The agency\u2019s records included a verbatim statement by the victim to a counselor. The governing legislation provided that the agency\u2019s records were confidential, but would be \u201cmade available to ... [a] court of competent jurisdiction pursuant to a court order.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 43 n. 2, 107 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 994 n. 2. The Court held that defendant was entitled, under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, to an <em>in camera </em>review of the agency\u2019s records to determine whether they contained any information relevant to his defense. <em>Id. </em>at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>56-58, 107 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1001-02; <em>see also State v. Cusick, </em>219 <em>N.J. Super. </em>452, 455-463 (App.Div.1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b528-5\">However, the Court in <em>Ritchie </em>carefully noted that the agency\u2019s records, although ordinarily confidential, were not the subject of any statutory privilege which would protect them from disclosure in judicial proceedings:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b528-6\">This is not a case where a state statute grants CYS the absolute authority to shield its files from all eyes. Cf. 42 Pa Cons Stat \u00a7 5945.1(b) (1982) (unqualified statutory privilege for communications between sexual assault counselors and victims). Rather, the Pennsylvania law provides that the information shall be disclosed in certain circumstances, including when CYS is directed to do so by court order. Pa Stat Ann, Title 11, \u00a7 2215(a)(5) (Purdon Supp 1986). Given that the Pennsylvania Legislature contemplated <em>some </em>use of CYS records in judicial proceedings, we cannot conclude that the statute prevents all disclosure in criminal prosecutions. In the absence of any apparent state policy to the contrary, we therefore have no reason to believe that relevant information would not be disclosed when a court of competent jurisdiction determines that the information is \u201cmaterial\u201d to the defense of the accused. [480 <em>U.S. </em>at 57-58, 107 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1001-02; footnote omitted; emphasis in original.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b528-7\">We are satisfied that the Due Process Clause, as interpreted in <em>Ritchie, </em>does not require the disclosure to a criminal defendant of communications protected by the attorney-client privilege. The Supreme Court has recognized that constitutional provisions relating to the conduct of criminal proceedings must be construed in light of established common law rules of evidence. Thus, in <em>Ohio v. Roberts, </em>448 <em>U.S. </em>56, 66, 100 <em>S.Ct. </em>2531, 65 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>597 (1980), the Court held that the Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment is not violated by the admission of hearsay statements \u201cwhere the evidence falls within a firmly rooted hearsay exception.\u201d Applying this principle, the Court has held that the Confrontation Clause is not violated by the admission of evidence pursuant to the co-conspirator exception to the hearsay rule. <em>Bourjaily v. United States, </em>483 <em>U.S. </em>171, 107 <em>S.Ct. </em>2775, 2782-2783, 97 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>144 (1987); <em>see also Mattox v. United States, </em>156 <em>U.S. </em>237, 243-244, 15 <em>S.Ct. </em>337, 340, 39 <em>L.Ed. </em>409 (1895) (expressing the view that the introduction of evidence pursuant to the dying declaration exception to the hearsay rule does not violate a criminal defendant\u2019s constitutional rights). In fact, the Court stated in un<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>equivocal language only last term, that \u201c[t]he accused does not have an unfettered right to offer testimony that is incompetent, privileged, or otherwise inadmissible under standard rules of evidence.\u201d <em>Taylor v. Illinois, </em>484 <em>U.S. </em>400, 108 <em>S.Ct. </em>646, 668, 98 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>798, 811 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b529-6\">The attorney-client privilege is an even more \u201cfirmly rooted\u201d part <em>of </em>the law of evidence than the co-conspirator exception to the hearsay rule upheld against constitutional attack in <em>Bourjaily. </em>Indeed, the Supreme Court has recognized that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b529-7\">The attorney-client privilege is the oldest of the privileges for confidential communications known to the common law. 8 J. Wigmore, Evidence \u00a7 2290 (McNaughton rev. 1961). Its purpose is to encourage full and frank communication between attorneys and their clients and thereby promote broader public interests in the observance of law and administration of justice. The privilege recognizes that sound legal advice or advocacy serves public ends and that such advice or advocacy depends upon the lawyer\u2019s being fully informed by the client. <em>[Upjohn Co. v. United States, </em>449 <em>U.S. </em>383, 389, 101 <em>S.Ct. </em>677, 682, 66 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>584 (1981).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b529-8\"><em>See also Trammel v. United States, </em>445 <em>U.S. </em>40, 51, 100 <em>S.Ct. </em>906, 912, 63 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>186 (1980); <em>Fisher v. United States, </em>425 <em>U.S. </em>391, 403, 96 <em>S.Ct. </em>1569, 1577, 48 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>39 (1976). Therefore, we conclude that a defendant\u2019s due process right to an <em>in camera </em>inspection of records which are subject by statute to disclosure to a court does not imply that there is a similar right to the disclosure of communications protected by the attorney-client privilege. <em>Cf. Washington v. Texas, </em>388 <em>U.S. </em>14, 23 n. 21, 87 <em>S.Ct. </em>1920, 1925 n. 21, 18 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>1019 (1967) (\u201cNothing in this opinion should be construed as disapproving testimonial privileges, such as ... the lawyer-client [privilege]\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b529-9\">This conclusion is supported by <em>Commonwealth v. Kyle, </em>367 <em>Pa.Super. </em>484, 533 A.2d 120 (1987), appeal den. 518 <em>Pa. </em>617, 541 A.2d 744 (1988), where the court held that a defendant accused of rape was not entitled to obtain <em>in camera </em>inspection of the files of the psychologist who treated the victim. The court noted that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b529-10\">Unlike the statutory conditional privilege at issue in <em>Ritchie, </em>the Pennsylvania law in this case grants an absolute privilege for communications between a licensed psychologist and a client. [533 A.2d at 125.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b530-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>The Court analogized the psychologist-client relationship to the attorney-client relationship:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b530-5\">[T]he psychologist-client privilege is modeled after the attorney-client privilege, an absolute privilege which has been repeatedly sustained under constitutional attack. Like the attorney-client privilege, the psychologist-client privilege protects an interest extrinsic from the truth-finding process. <em>[Id. </em>at 125-126; citations omitted.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b530-6\">Accordingly, the court concluded that defendant was not entitled to <em>in camera </em>inspection of the victim\u2019s communications to her psychologist.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b530-7\">[T]he purpose of the psychologist-client privilege is to aid in the effective treatment of the client by encouraging the patient to disclose information fully and freely without fear of public disclosure. We deem this purpose and the underlying considerations to be of paramount concern. Subjecting the confidential file to <em>in camera </em>review by the trial court (as well as the appellate courts and staff members) would jeopardize the treatment process and undermine the public interests supporting the privilege. <em>[Id. </em>at 181.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b530-8\"><em>See also People v. Foggy, </em>121 <em>Ill.2d </em>337, 118 <em>Ill.Dec. </em>18, 521 <em>N.E.26 </em>86 (1988), <em>cert. </em>den. \u2014 US.-, 108 <em>S.Ct. </em>2044, 100 <em>L.Ed.26 </em>628 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b530-11\">Defendant argues that because there are certain exceptions to the attorney-client privilege recognized in New Jersey, the privilege is not \u201cabsolute\u201d and therefore under <em>Ritchie \u201cin camera </em>review is constitutionally mandated in order to d\u00e9termine whether the records in fact are material to the defense.\u201d Defendant notes that in addition to the statutory exceptions to the privilege, the New Jersey courts have recognized there may be other circumstances which are \u201cso grave ... that the privilege must yield to the most fundamental values of our justice system.\u201d <em>In re Nackson, </em>114 <em>N.J. </em>527, 532 (1989); <em>see also In re Kozlov, </em>79 <em>N.J. </em>232, 243 (1979). However, such circumstances have been found only where an attorney possesses specific information communicated by the client which is unavailable from less intrusive sources, such as the client\u2019s identity or address, and even then the moving party must show that the public interest in disclosure outweighs the client\u2019s legitimate expectation in confidentiality. <em>In re Nackson, supra, </em>114 <em>N.J. </em>at 538-539; <em>In re Kozlov, supra, </em>79 <em>N.J. </em>at 243-244.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>The circumstances of this case are significantly different from those involved in <em>Nackson </em>and <em>Kozlov. </em>Defendant does not seek information pertinent to his defense which he is unable to obtain from any other source. Rather, defendant seeks to obtain his children\u2019s privileged communications with their attorney solely for the purpose of attacking their credibility. As a foundation for this application, defendant relies upon the fact that the children subsequently recanted their charges against him. Defendant, assuming that his children also told their attorney that their original charges were not truthful,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> argues that he is entitled to such statements \u201cto rebut the prosecution\u2019s likely attempt to dismiss or minimize evidence of recantation.\u201d <footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Indeed, defendant suggests that any statements made by the minors to their attorney in the belief that they would remain confidential would be especially persuasive to the jury in resolving issues of credibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-6\">We are convinced that disclosure of privileged communications solely for this purpose would seriously undermine the attorney-client relationship by discouraging \u201cfree and full disclosure of information from the client to the attorney.\u201d <em>Fellerman v. Bradley, supra, </em>99 <em>N.J. </em>at 498. Rather than being able to assure her clients at the outset of any representation that \u201canything you and I discuss is confidential,\u201d the law guardian would have to advise them that their communications could be subject to <em>in camera </em>review by a court and, if that review revealed any apparent inconsistencies with their prior state-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>merits, possible disclosure to third parties including the alleged abusive parent. In the face of such advice, the clients would be hesitant to confide in their attorney, and the attorney would not acquire the full understanding of the facts required to provide the clients effective legal advice and representation. <em>See In re Shargel, </em>742 <em>F.2d </em>61, 63 (2nd Cir.1984); <em>Macey v. Rollins Environmental Services (N.J.), Inc., </em>179 <em>N.J.Super. </em>535 (App. Div.1981).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Hence, the possible use for impeachment purposes of the children's communications to the law guardian is not a circumstance \u201cso grave\u201d that the attorney-client privilege \u201cmust yield\u201d to other more \u201cfundamental values of our justice system.\u201d <em>In re Nackson, supra, </em>114 <em>N.J. </em>at 532; <em>cf. State v. Boiardo, </em>83 <em>N.J. </em>350 (1980); <em>State v. Boiardo, </em>82 <em>N.J. </em>446, 467-469 (1980). Consequently, we conclude that the \u201climited exceptions to the privilege\u201d recognized in New Jersey, <em>Fellerman v. Bradley, supra, </em>99 <em>N.J. </em>at 502,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> do not make attorney-client communications subject to disclosure to the court or to litigants simply upon a showing of the materiality required for disclosure of the social service records involved in <em>Ritchie.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b532-5\">Defendant also argues, relying upon <em>Davis v. Alaska, </em>415 <em>U.S. </em>308, 94 <em>S.Ct. </em>1105, 39 L.Ed.2d 347 (1974), that he is entitled under the Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment to an <em>in camera </em>inspection of the law guardian\u2019s notes of any interviews with his children to determine whether they contain anything which may be useful to impeach their charges against him. However, a four member plurality of the Supreme Court held in <em>Ritchie </em>that the Confrontation Clause does not \u201crequire the pretrial disclosure of any and all information that might be useful in contradicting unfavorable testimony.\u201d 480 <em>U.S. </em>at 53, 107 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 999. Rather, it is solely \u201ca <em>trial </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>right, designed to prevent improper restrictions on the types of questions that defense counsel may ask during cross-examination.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 52, 107 <em>S. Ct. </em>at 999 (emphasis in original).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b533-6\">Moreover, even if the Confrontation Clause included rights to pretrial discovery, those rights would not extend to the compelled disclosure of communications protected by the attorney-client privilege. As previously noted, the Confrontation Clause has been interpreted in light of established common law rules of evidence. <em>Bourjaily v. United States, supra. </em>Those rules include the attorney-client privilege, which is \u201cof broader and deeper significance than [the] statute relating to the confidentiality of juvenile records [involved in <em>Davis v. Alaska </em>].\u201d <em>Mills v. State, </em>476 So.2d 172, 176 (Fla.1985), <em>cert. </em>den. 475 <em>U.S. </em>1031, 106 <em>S.Ct. </em>1241, 89 L.Ed.2d 349 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b533-7\">Finally, we reject defendant\u2019s argument that an <em>in camera </em>review of the law guardian\u2019s notes is required to determine whether any of her communications with her clients were outside the attorney-client privilege. This case does not involve an attorney who occupies a position such as an in house corporate counsel, where an <em>in camera </em>review may be required to determine whether communications relevant to the case \u201cwere made within [the attorney\u2019s] professional capacity as a lawyer.\u201d <em>United Jersey Bank v. Wolosoff, </em>196 <em>N.J.Super. </em>553, 563 (App.Div.1984). The law guardian was appointed to represent the children in connection with DYFS\u2019s complaint alleging that they were sexually abused by defendant. Since the criminal charges against defendant are based on these same <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>allegations, any relevant communications between the law guardian and the children would necessarily be protected by the attorney-client privilege.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-5\">Accordingly, the order requiring an <em>in camera </em>inspection of the law guardian\u2019s records of her interviews with the alleged victims is reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b523-9\"> Although E.P. is not alleged to have been the victim of any sexual abuse, DYFS\u2019 complaint seeks to place all three of defendant\u2019s minor children under its care and supervision. Thus, the law guardian represents E.P. as well as defendant\u2019s minor daughters.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b525-14\"> DYFS did not appeal from the order requiring <em>in camera </em>review of its records. However, it filed a letter brief supporting the law guardian\u2019s position that her notes of interviews with the alleged victims are protected by the attorney-client privilege. The prosecutor submitted a letter stating that he takes no position with respect to the appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b526-6\">Even if the Legislature did not intend a law guardian to occupy the role of an attorney in child abuse proceedings, the communications between the law guardian and defendant\u2019s minor children still would be protected by the attorney-client privilege. This court has recognized that where there is mistaken representation of the existence of a confidential attorney-client relationship and the purported client reasonably relies on that representation by communicating privileged information, the communication is protected by the attorney-client privilege. <em>State v. Tapia, </em>113 <em>N.J.Super, </em>322, 330 (App.Div.1971); <em>see also McCormick, Evidence, </em>\u00a7 88 (3d ed. 1984). The law guardian\u2019s representation, on \"State of New Jersey\" stationery, that she was their \u201ccourt appointed attorney\" and that \u201d[a]nything you and I discuss is CONFIDENTIAL,\u201d would provide a sufficient basis for finding such a <em>de facto </em>attorney-client relationship.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b531-7\"> This assumption is speculative. In light of the victim\u2019s alleged recantations, we asked the law guardian at oral argument whether her clients would waive their attorney-client privilege with respect to their communications with her. The law guardian indicated that her clients understood they could waive the privilege and had expressly declined to do so.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b531-8\"> We note that defendant already has access to other statements by the alleged victims which may be used for the same purpose, including a psychologist\u2019s report which clearly sets forth that both L.P. and K.P. have recanted their initial allegations. In addition, the record suggests that DYFS' files may contain references to recantations.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b532-6\"> Indeed, the lack of fully informed advice from the law guardian could result in the minors giving less accurate testimony at defendant\u2019s criminal trial.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b532-7\"> Similar exceptions are recognized in every other jurisdiction. <em>See </em>8 <em>Wig-more, Evidence, </em>\u00a7 2292 n. 2 (McNaughton rev. ed. 1961 and 1988 supp.).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b533-8\"> Defendant urges that we construe the Confrontation Clause of Article I, section 10 of the New Jersey Constitution more broadly than the plurality of the Supreme Court construed the Confrontation Clause of the United States Constitution in <em>Ritchie. </em>However, we are convinced that disclosure of the law guardian\u2019s records would not he required even under the broader interpretation of the Confrontation Clause urged by the dissenters in <em>Ritchie. </em>Therefore, we have no occasion to decide whether there are any circumstances in which the Confrontation Clause of the New Jersey Constitution might be interpreted more broadly than the Confrontation Clause of the United States Constitution.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
