Upon entering into the agreement, Blitz tendered a deposit of $650,000. The closing which was scheduled for August 31, 1987, was postponed until September 29, 1987.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-10\">On September 22, 1987, Blitz filed a complaint against 970 Realty and defendant Stuart Eisenberger (Eisenberger), a partner at 970 Realty (collectively defendants), alleging that there was widespread environmental contamination of the property (which had previously housed Purolator Products, Inc.) and that Eisenberger fraudulently induced Blitz to enter into the agreement to purchase the property. The complaint charged that Eisenberger told Blitz, who was only \u201cvaguely aware\u201d of the Environmental Cleanup Responsibility Act, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>13:lK-6 <em>et seq. </em>(ECRA), that the property was generally ECRA clean and that the cost of the cleanup for the \u201cone or two places of pollution or contamination\u201d would be covered by a $200,000 letter of credit that had been posted in response to an adminis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>trative consent order entered into with the Department of Environmental Protection in February 1985. On the basis of these allegations, Blitz sought a number of different remedies including a restraint on the sale of the property pending a determination of its environmental status; a postponement of the closing; the posting of security by Eisenberger to cover cleanup; rescission; return of Blitz\u2019 deposit; and damages, both punitive and compensatory.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-6\">During the course of discovery, defendants claimed that Blitz had consulted with various attorneys with regard to ECRA and the advisability of entering into the agreement to purchase the property. Blitz denied that she had consulted with any attorney other than Leo Kaplowitz, her present attorney, prior to signing the agreement. In any event, there was a factual issue presented as to whether plaintiff sought and received counsel from any other attorney in connection with the environmental issue prior to the signing. On June 24,1988, defendants filed a notice of motion whereby they sought to compel Blitz to waive the attorney-client privilege \u201cwith respect to communications between herself and attorneys regarding ECRA or the advisibility of entering into the subject transaction,\u201d or alternatively to dismiss the fraud allegations of plaintiff\u2019s complaint. The trial judge granted defendants\u2019 motion to waive plaintiff\u2019s attorney-client privilege. He stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b63-7\">Furthermore, communications which the defendant requests in my judgment are relevant to the matter. What communications or knowledge did the plaintiff have at the time she contends she relied solely on defendant\u2019s statements? Also, this information should be obtained from the plaintiff, the attorney involved. To do otherwise would raise questions of hearsay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b63-8\">Based on all of the foregoing I will grant the motion of defendant and permit the attorney-client privilege to be deemed waived, and I will order the depositions be taken of those individuals which are the subject of this motion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b63-9\">Defendants submitted a proposed order which contained the following language:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b63-10\">HEREBY ORDERED that the plaintiff, Jeanette Blitz, her agents and representatives, are hereby deemed to have waived the attorney /client privilege with respect to all communications and conversations of every kind between the plaintiff, Jeanette Blitz, her agents and attorneys, and all attorneys concerning ECRA (\u201cEnvironmental Clean-up Responsibility Act\u201d) or other environmental <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>matters relating to any real property in the state of New Jersey or with respect to the advisability or lack thereof of entering into or concluding the real property transaction commonly referred to as the Purolator Property in Rah-way, New Jersey.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b64-6\">Blitz objected to the scope of the proposed waiver order. Specifically, Blitz claimed that the order was \u201coverbroad in that it [went] ... beyond the signing of the Agreement and [spoke] of concluding the transaction.\u201d Defendants argued that the order had to encompass Blitz\u2019 communications with her counsel following the signing of the agreement of sale on July 26, 1987 because these communications could show the extent of plaintiff\u2019s \u201cprior knowledge of ECRA expecially as it existed at or prior to signing\u201d the agreement of sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-7\">On September 16,1988, a second hearing was held before the trial judge. The purpose of this hearing was to address Blitz\u2019 objection to the form of the order as submitted by defendants\u2019 attorney on the issue of the attorney-client privilege. At the conclusion of this hearing, the judge ruled that the order waiving Blitz\u2019 attorney-client privilege would encompass not only communications made prior to the agreement but also communications made after the agreement was signed but prior to the institution of the suit. The trial judge noted, however, that the order would not encompass \u201cwork product\u201d or communications with respect to \u201ctrial strategy.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b64-8\">Blitz appeals claiming that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b64-9\">THE ORDER OF THE COURT IN WAIVING THE ATTORNEY/CLIENT PRIVILEGE WENT FAR BEYOND THE RELIEF ASKED FOR IN THE NOTICE OF MOTION AND DEMONSTRATES CLEAR ERROR IN THAT THE WAIVER EXTENDED BEYOND THE DATE OF THE INDUCEMENT OF THE FRAUD WHICH OCCURRED WHEN THE PARTIES SIGNED THE AGREEMENT ON JULY 26, 1987.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b64-10\">A. The scope of the waiver constitutes clear error and is without a basis in law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b64-11\">B. The manner in which the defendants seduced the trial court into extending the waiver of the attomey/client privilege beyond the date of the inducement of the fraud, which was the signing of the Agreement on July 26,1987, and to include the time period up to the filing of the Verified Complaint on September 22, 1987, mocks the concept of justice.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b64-12\">We have carefully reviewed this record in light of the claims advanced and have determined that the trial judge erred in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>extending the waiver beyond the date of the signing of the agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-6\">\u201cThe attorney-client privilege, which is the oldest of the privileges for confidential communications, is firmly embedded in our common law.\u201d <em>Macey v. Rollins Environmental Services (N.J.), </em>179 <em>N.J.Super. </em>535, 538 (App.Div.1981); <em>see Upjohn Co. v. United States, </em>449 <em>U.S. </em>383, 389, 101 <em>S.Ct. </em>677, 684, 66 <em>L.Ed. 2d </em>584, 591 (1981); <em>Fellerman v. Bradley, </em>99 <em>N.J. </em>493, 498 (1985); <em>United Jersey Bank v. Wolosoff, </em>196 <em>N.J.Super. </em>553, 561 (App.Div.1984). Although the privilege was not originally set forth in either constitutional or statutory form it is presently codified in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:84A-20 and embodied in <em>Evid. R. </em>26. <em>See Fellerman, </em>supra, 99 <em>N.J. </em>at 498; <em>United Jersey Bank, supra, </em>196 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 561; <em>Macey, supra, </em>179 <em>N.J. Super, </em>at 538-539.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-7\">\u201cThe privilege recognizes that sound legal advice or advocacy serves public ends and rests on the need to \u2018encourage full and frank communication between attorneys and their clients.\u2019 \u201d <em>United Jersey Bank, supra, </em>196 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 561 (quoting <em>Upjohn Co., supra, </em>449 <em>U.S. </em>at 389, 101 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 677, 66 L.Ed.2d at 591); <em>see Fellerman, supra, </em>99 <em>N.J. </em>at 498; <em>Macey, supra, </em>179 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 539. Thus, \u201c[wjhere the privilege is applicable, \u2018it must be given as broad a scope as its rationale requires.\u2019 \u201d <em>United Jersey Bank, supra, </em>196 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 561 (quoting <em>Ervesun v. Bank of N. Y., </em>99 <em>N.J.Super. </em>162, 168 (App.Div.1968), certif. den. 51 <em>N.J. </em>394 (1968)).</p>\n<p id=\"b65-8\">The attorney-client privilege, however, is not absolute. <em>See Fellerman, supra, </em>99 <em>N.J. </em>at 502; <em>In re Selser, </em>15 <em>N.J. </em>393, 405-406 (1954). It advances secrecy and therefore \u201c \u2018runs counter to the fundamental theory of our judicial system that the fullest disclosure of the facts will best lead to the truth.\u2019 \u201d <em>United Jersey Bank, supra, </em>196 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 560 (quoting <em>In re Selser, supra, </em>15 <em>N.J. </em>at 405; <em>see Fellerman, supra, </em>99 <em>N.J. </em>at 502. \u201c[Cjonsiderations of public policy and concern for proper judicial administration have led the legislature and the courts to fashion limited exceptions to the privilege.\u201d <em>Feller-</em></p>\n<p id=\"b66-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number><em>man, supra, </em>99 <em>N.J. </em>at 502; <em>see Clark v.

The court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b66-6\">\u00a1T]here are necessary foundations to the valid piercing of any such privilege, one of which is absent here. There must be a legitimate need of the party to reach the evidence sought to be shielded. There must be a showing of relevance and materiality of that evidence to the issue before the court. The record here clearly bespeaks the existence of these necessary elements. But it must also be shown, as pointed out by Justice Mountain for this Court in <em>Farber, </em>supra,\"to the satisfaction of \u201cthe trial judge, by a fair preponderance of the evidence including all reasonable inferences, that * * * the information * * * <em>could not be secured from any less intrusive source.\u201d [Id. </em>79 <em>N.J. </em>at 243-244 (quoting <em>In re Farber, </em>78 <em>N.J. </em>259, 276-277 (1978), <em>cert. </em>den. <em>New York Times Co. v. New Jersey, </em>439 <em>U.S. </em>997, 99 <em>S.Ct. </em>598, 58 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>670 (1978)); emphasis in original].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b66-7\">The test set forth in <em>Kozlov </em>was applied by us in <em>United Jersey Bank v. Wolosoff, </em>196 <em>N.J.Super. </em>553 (App.Div.1984) in a context relevant to this case. In <em>United Jersey Bank, </em>plaintiff alleged that defendant\u2019s attorneys had \u201cintentionally and fraudulently misrepresented [defendant\u2019s] financial condition in order to obtain a reduction of the amount owed [to plaintiff] on the judgment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 559. During the course of discovery, plaintiff acknowledged that certain documents it had prepared during the period of settlement negotiations were relevant to the issue of whether it had relied on defendant\u2019s attorney\u2019s representations of defendant\u2019s finances. Therefore, plaintiff waived the attorney-client privilege with respect to these documents. <em>Id. </em>at 559-560. With respect to all other documents and materials, however, plaintiff\u2019s attorney asserted the attorney-client privilege. <em>Id. </em>at 560. The trial judge held, as a matter of law, that \u201call confidential communications were to be disclosed because they might bear upon the question of reasonable reliance.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 560. On appeal, we noted that defendant had \u201csatisfied the tripartite formula established in <em>In re Kozlov ... </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>and to that extent the attorney-client privilege must yield.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 565. However, we found the trial judge\u2019s waiver order too broad:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b67-6\">In any event, plaintiffs knowledge of [defendant\u2019s] financial condition at the time of the stipulation of settlement may well reveal the extent to which it relied upon the alleged misrepresentations. Since it is undisputed that [plaintiff\u2019s in-house counsel] played a key role in negotiating the settlement, communications between him and others may be extremely probative. Clearly, defendants have a \u201clegitimate need\u201d for disclosure of such information, the communications are both \u201crelevant and material,\u201d and the evidence cannot be secured from any \u201cless intrusive source.\u201d <em>[Id. </em>196 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 565 (quoting <em>In re Kozlov, supra, </em>79 <em>N.J. </em>at 243-244)].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b67-7\">He \u00a1|e # ije He H\u00a1 O H*</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b67-8\">We are persuaded that \u201cwhen confidential communications are made a material issue in a judicial proceeding, fairness demands waiver of the privilege.\u201d In point of fact, plaintiff acknowledged as much when it agreed to release all documente, including those otherwise protected by the attorney-client privilege, with respect to the time period during which the settlement was negotiated. However, we are persuaded that this offer was far too restrictive. Conceivably, there may be communications between [plaintiff\u2019s in-house counsel] and others that pertain to defendant\u2019s financial condition which were made prior to the entry of the judgment on March 2, 1981. To the extent that such documents are pertinent to the issue of reasonable reliance, we believe that they should be disclosed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b67-9\">Nonetheless, we are convinced that the order of the Chancery Division goes well beyond that which is reasonably necessary to insure fairness to the parties. We are satisfied that the competing demands of secrecy and disclosure can best be accommodated by compelling the release of only those documents which bear upon the extent to which plaintiff reasonably relied upon the representations allegedly made during the negotiation process. Obviously, this question cannot be fairly resolved without a painstaking review and inspection of the communications sought to be barred. We note in that regard that plaintiff cannot invoke the privilege to render conclusive its own evaluation of the nature and character of the materials in question. Rather, an <em>in camera </em>inspection by the court is clearly required. <em>[Id. </em>196 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 567-568; citation omitted; footnote omitted],</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b67-10\">Hs \u00a1i\u00a1 si! s\u00a1\u00a1 <em>f,i </em>H' <em>''f</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b67-11\">Here, as all parties acknowledge, our law compelled disclosure of communications otherwise protected by the attorney-client privilege to the extent that they were pertinent to the question of reasonable reliance. Therefore, disclosure was mandated by virtue of the necessity of piercing the privilege under <em>In re Koslov, supra. This limited disclosure, however, extends no further than that particular subject matter. Wholly irrelevant communications before and after settlement negotiations having no possible bearing on this question remain protected by the attorney-client privilege. [Id. </em>at 567 n. 3; emphasis supplied].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b68-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>Here, Blitz claims that Eisenberger falsely represented the environmental condition of the premises to her. She alleges that she was only \u201cvaguely aware of ECRA\u201d and that she relied upon Eisenberger\u2019s false representations and promises and was fraudulently induced into signing the agreement of sale. She further alleges that she \u201ctrusted Eisenberger to such an extent that she overrode the advice of counsel who insisted that all promises and representations of any sort should be contained in the Agreement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b68-5\">Legal fraud may be proved by the establishment of five elements: (1) a material representation by defendant of a presently existing or past fact; (2) knowledge or belief by the defendant of its falsity; (3) an intent that the plaintiff rely upon it; (4) reasonable reliance by the plaintiff; and (5) resulting damage to the plaintiff. <em>Jewish Center of Sussex Cty. v. Whale, </em>86 <em>N.J. </em>619, 624 (1981); <em>Enright v. Lubow, </em>202 <em>N.J.Super. </em>58, 72 (App.Div.1985), certif. den. 104 <em>N.J. </em>376 (1986); <em>Foont-Freedenfeld v. Electro-Protective, </em>126 <em>N.J.Super. </em>254, 257 (App.Div.1973), aff'd o.b. 64 <em>N.J. </em>197 (1974). \u201c[E]quitable fraud does not require the element of scienter, knowledge of the falsity and an intent to obtain an undue advantage.\u201d <em>Enright, supra, </em>202 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 72; <em>see Jewish Center of Sussex Cty., supra, </em>86 <em>N.J. </em>at 625; <em>Foont-Freedenfeld, supra, </em>126 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 257. Reasonable reliance thus constitutes a critical element of a cause of action for legal or equitable fraud. <em>United Jersey Bank, supra, </em>196 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 564; <em>see DSK Enterprises, Inc. v. United Jersey Bank, </em>189 <em>N.J.Super. </em>242, 251 (App.Div.1983), certif. den. 94 <em>N.J. </em>598 (1983); <em>Prosser, Law of Torts </em>(4 ed.1971), \u00a7 108 at 714-720.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-6\">The nature and extent of the reliance required to establish a claim of legal or equitable fraud is subject to debate. <em>See United Jersey Bank, supra, </em>196 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 564. Although \u201c[o]ne who engages in fraud ... may not urge that one's victim should have been more circumspect or astute,\u201d <em>Jewish Center of Sussex Cty., supra, </em>86 <em>N.J. </em>at 626 n. 1, \u201cif a party to whom <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>representations are made nevertheless chooses to investigate the relevant state of facts for himself, he will be deemed to have relied on his own investigation and will be charged with knowledge of whatever he could have discovered by a reasonable investigation.\u201d <em>DSK Enterprises, Inc., supra, </em>189 <em>N.J. Super, </em>at 251.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-6\">In connection with the question of reliance and her knowledge of the environmental condition of the property, Blitz does not contest that defendants satisfied the tripartite <em>Kozlov </em>test with respect to confidential attorney-client communications made up until the signing of the agreement of sale. Rather, she argues that <em>Kozlov </em>has not been satisfied with respect to the communications made from the date of the signing of the agreement of sale until the date of the institution of the action. We agree. Blitz placed in issue what she knew prior to the signing. This gave rise to a need within the meaning of <em>Kozlov </em>for defendants to reach all evidence of that knowledge including evidence of otherwise privileged communications which took place prior to the signing. An entirely different case is presented with respect to the post-signing period.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-7\">Defendants argue that Blitz placed in issue \u201cher knowledge of environmental laws and her reasons for not entering into the subject transaction\u201d and that those reasons justify waiver of the attorney-client privilege for the period from the signing of the agreement to the institution of the suit. Each of these arguments is wide of the mark. Blitz\u2019 knowledge of the environmental laws or the environmental condition of the premises acquired after the signing is entirely irrelevant to the reliance issue. The alternative suggestion that Blitz might have had other reasons for refusing to consummate the deal, which reasons could possibly be revealed by exposing confidences between Blitz and her lawyers exchanged after the signing, is pure speculation which falls far short of the legitimate need requirement of <em>Kozlov. </em>The rest of defendants\u2019 arguments are equally unconvincing. They suggest that it is possible to learn from the revelation of post-signing confidences what Blitz knew <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>pre-signing. Although entirely speculative, this could prove correct. Theoretically,. Blitz might have made an off-hand comment to one of her lawyers the day after the signing in which she cited the ECRA laws, chapter and verse. The problem with defendants\u2019 theory is that possibility is not enough. We are not reviewing an ordinary discovery motion. There, the standard would be whether the inquiry was reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence. <em>R. </em>4:10-2(a). Under <em>Kozlov, </em>the standard is higher. That is because in this situation we are attempting to strike the delicate balance between two of the basic but competing principles underpinning our system of jurisprudence. Reconciling the policy of full disclosure with the confidentiality necessary to ensure faith and frankness between attorney and client requires a greater showing than that the invasion will possibly produce admissible evidence. Thus, we agree entirely with the waiver as to pre-signing communications but draw the line as of the date of the signing. This is not to suggest that if evidence from a non-privileged source establishes the legitimate need (within the meaning of <em>Kozlov) </em>for discovery of a particular privileged communication made after the signing that an application would be denied. That will depend on the evidence. We reverse and remand for the entry of an appropriate order.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
