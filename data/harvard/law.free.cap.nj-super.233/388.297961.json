The Law Division order enforced a judgment previously entered against defendant in the Circuit Court of Waukesha County, Wisconsin. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-7\">There is no dispute as to the material facts. Defendant is a New Jersey corporation which sells and services boilers and boiler materials. It has two places of business \u2014 one located in Edison, New Jersey and the other located in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania. Plaintiff is a Wisconsin corporation which performs \u201cexecutive search, management consulting, and outplacement services\u201d. Its principal place of business is located in Brook-field, Wisconsin.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-8\">By a telephone call presumably from New Jersey or Pennsylvania on December 11, 1986, Michael Miller, defendant\u2019s president, contacted Richard J. Kendro, vice president of plaintiff, seeking to engage plaintiff\u2019s services to search for a new general manager for defendant\u2019s Pennsylvania office. An agreement was reached and confirmed in writing from plaintiff to defendant the same day, and pursuant to Kendro\u2019s request, Miller forwarded to plaintiff a variety of materials including a description of defendant\u2019s boilers and a specification book.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-9\">After receiving the materials, plaintiff proceeded to contact and screen \u201capproximately 30-35 potential prospects\u201d for the position, ultimately trimming that list \u201cto 5 viable candidates.\u201d Kendro forwarded the five candidates\u2019 \u201cpresentations\u201d to Miller and confirmed with Miller his \u201cagreement to come to Milwaukee, Wisconsin to personally participate in final interview processes.\u201d A number of telephone conversations between Kendro and Miller ensued to arrange the details of Miller\u2019s trip. Pursuant to those conversations Kendro made arrangements, including hotel reservations, for Miller to interview the five candi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>dates at plaintiffs Wisconsin offices on March 4, 1987. The arrangements with Miller were also confirmed in writing.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-5\">However, on February 23, 1987 Miller telephoned Kendro to advise him that defendant wished to \u201cterminate the search.\u201d As a result, plaintiff on that date forwarded a final invoice to defendant for \u201cprofessional recruitment services\u201d \"rendered in the amount of $11,752.86. Defendant did not pay that amount to plaintiff, apparently taking issue with the number of hours for which it was billed by plaintiff. Consequently, on August 28, 1987 plaintiff filed a one-count complaint in the Circuit Court of Waukesha County, Wisconsin, seeking judgment against defendant for the invoice amount plus interest and costs. Defendant chose not to defend against the Wisconsin action.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Thus, on November 18, 1987 a default judgment was entered against defendant by the Wisconsin court in the aggregate amount of $12,902.72.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-6\">Plaintiff subsequently instituted this action in the Law Division, seeking the enforcement of the Wisconsin default judgment. Plaintiff moved for summary judgment in its favor, based upon the Wisconsin judgment, while defendant cross-moved for summary judgment in its favor, asserting that it \u201cnever did business\u201d in Wisconsin and that no agent or representative of defendant\u2019s had \u201cever travelled to Wisconsin to do any business on behalf of [defendant] of any kind.\u201d Both motions were initially denied. However, plaintiff moved for reconsideration of the denial of its motion, and Judge Breitkopf granted summary judgment in its favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>Defendant appeals from the Law Division\u2019s grant of summary judgment in plaintiff\u2019s favor. It contends that, because defendant conducts business \u201conly in the State of New Jersey and Pennsylvania,\u201d has no place of business in Wisconsin and has \u201cnever advertised or solicited business\u201d there, and since no agents or other representatives of defendant have \u201cever travelled to Wisconsin\u201d on defendant\u2019s behalf, the Wisconsin default judgment \u201cis not entitled to full faith and credit in New Jersey\u201d and \u201cthe Wisconsin court\u2019s assertion of personal jurisdiction over [defendant] was not supported by sufficient minimum contact between [defendant] and the forum state____\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b425-6\">Plaintiff contends, on the other hand, that defendant, \u201cby <em>soliciting </em>[plaintiff] to perform an executive search for a general manager for [defendant\u2019s] plant in Pennsylvania, satisfied the necessary jurisdictional minimum contacts for purposes of in personam jurisdiction.\u201d (emphasis in original). Judge Breitlcopf, in his June 22, 1988 opinion, substantially agreed with plaintiff\u2019s position, pointing to \u201ca period of two months where multiple phone conversations and mailing occurred between the two parties\u201d and determining that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b425-7\">[i]n the present case, the defendant made an unsolicited call from its New Jersey office to defendant\u2019s office in Wisconsin. An offer was made by plaintiff which defendant relied upon. Follow-up conversations and mailings took place between the parties resulting in defendant actively engaging in performing services for [plaintiff].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b425-8\">We conclude that Judge Breitkopf was correct in granting plaintiff\u2019s motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-9\">A judgment properly entered in accordance with local procedures is entitled to full faith and credit in the courts of any other state, under Art. IV, \u00a7 1 of the United States Constitution, provided that the judgment is not rendered in violation of the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. <em>World-Wide Volkswagen Corp. v.

To be valid, the original judgment must be founded upon adequate jurisdiction over both the subject matter and the parties. <em>World-Wide Volkswagen, </em>444 <em>U.S. </em>at 291, 100 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 564, 62 L.Ed.2d at 497; <em>James v. Francesco, </em>61 <em>N.J. </em>480, 485 (1972); <em>Hupp v. Accessory Distributors, </em>193 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 708. Consequently before it is bound by the original judgment, the court in the second state \u201cmay inquire into the jurisdictional basis of the foreign court\u2019s decree\u201d and, \u201c[i]f that court did not have jurisdiction over the subject matter or the relevant parties, full faith and credit need not be given.\u201d <em>Underwriters National Assurance Co. v.

The jurisdictional test is not to be applied mechanically, but rather \u201cthe quality and nature of the [defendant\u2019s] activity in relation to the fair and orderly administration of the laws\u201d must be examined on a case-by-case basis, 326 <em>U.S. </em>at 319, 66 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 159, 90 <em>L.Ed. </em>at 104, and \u201cthe defendant\u2019s conduct and connection with the forum State [must be] such that he should reasonably anticipate being haled into court there,\u201d <em>World-Wide Volkswagen, </em>444 <em>U.S. </em>at 297, 100 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 567, 62 L.Ed.2d at 501. \u201cThe unilateral activity of those who claim some relationship with a nonresident cannot satisfy the requirement of contact with the forum State\u201d \u2014 rather, \u201cit is essential in each case that there be some act by which the defendant purposefully avails itself of the privilege of conducting activities within the forum State, thus invoking the benefits and protections of its laws.\u201d <em>Hanson v.

Where the cause of action arises out of, or is related to, the defendant\u2019s contacts with the forum state, \u201c[s]o long as it creates a \u2018substantial connection\u2019 with the forum, even a single act can support jurisdiction.\u201d <em>Burger King, </em>471 <em>U.S. </em>at 476 n. 18, 105 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2184 n. 18, 85 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 543 n. 18. <em>See also McGee v. International Life Insurance Co., </em>355 <em>U.S. </em>220, 223, 78 <em>S.Ct. </em>199, 201, 2 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>223, 226 (1957) (delivery by mail of a life insurance policy to California, acceptance of premium payments mailed from that state and the fact that the insured\u2019s residence was located there at the time of his death, constituted sufficient contact for a California court to exercise jurisdiction over a Texas insurer); <em>Wisconsin Electrical Manufacturing Co. v. Pennant Products, Inc., </em>619 <em>F.2d </em>676, 677-678 &amp; n. 6 (7th Cir.1980) (while personal visits were involved, only contacts with Wisconsin related to contract involved in the case); <em>Charles Gendler &amp; Co. v. Telecom Equipment Corp., </em>102 <em>N.J. </em>at 471-472 (1986) (isolated act sufficient to confer <em>in personam </em>jurisdiction where action is based on that contact).</p>\n<p id=\"b428-4\">Here, the dispute which formed the basis for plaintiff\u2019s Wisconsin action arises out of a promise by defendant to pay for services to be performed in Wisconsin by plaintiff. Moreover, pursuant to defendant\u2019s specific request, plaintiff actually performed services for defendant in Wisconsin. Thus, we conclude that there were sufficient contacts for the exercise of <em>in personam </em>jurisdiction over defendant by the courts of Wisconsin with respect to this transaction. Here, it was the nonresident defendant who solicited the resident plaintiff\u2019s services. Consequently, plaintiff cannot be said to have \u201cunilaterally\u201d undertaken to perform services for defendant in a foreign state. To the contrary, defendant purposefully availed itself of services which it knew or should have known would be performed by plaintiff on defendant\u2019s behalf in Wisconsin. Wheth<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>er defendant could or could not enforce its contract rights against plaintiff in New Jersey is irrelevant, as is the question of whether plaintiff could enforce its contract against defendant in New Jersey.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b429-6\">As the Seventh Circuit has noted, \u201c[f]or the exercise of personal jurisdiction, the defendant need not have been physically present within the forum state,\u201d but rather \u201cneed only have acted indirectly within the forum state.\u201d <em>Wisconsin Electrical Manufacturing Co. v. Pennant Products Inc., supra, </em>619 <em>F.2d </em>at 678 n. 6 (7th Cir.1980). <em>Compare also, e.g., Colony Press, Inc. v. Fleeman, </em>17 <em>Ill.App.3d </em>14, 308 N.E.2d 78 (1974) <em>and Cook Associates, Inc. v. Colonial Broach &amp; Machine Co., </em>14 <em>Ill.App.3d </em>965, 304 <em>N.E.2d </em>27 (1973) (holding <em>in personam </em>jurisdiction) <em>with Maurice Sternberg, Inc. v. James, </em>577 <em>F.Supp. </em>882 (N.D.Ill.1984) <em>and Afirm, Inc. v. Frazee Paint and Wallcovering Co., </em>624 <em>F.Supp. </em>973, 975 n. 4 (N.D.Ill.1985) (holding no <em>in personam </em>jurisdiction).</p>\n<p id=\"b429-7\"><em>Cook Associates, Inc. v. Colonial Broach &amp; Machine Co., supra, </em>is factually similar to this case. In response to a mass <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>mailing sent by the plaintiff, an Illinois employment agency, to a number of prospective employers, the defendant, a Delaware corporation doing business in Michigan, contacted plaintiff and asked to be referred to a specific individual whose personal data appeared in the mailing. 304 N.E.2d at 28-29. After a referral agreement was arranged between the parties, plaintiff forwarded a copy of the individual\u2019s resume to defendant. <em>Id. </em>at 29. Defendant interviewed the individual and a year later hired him for a position at defendant\u2019s Michigan office, but refused to pay plaintiff\u2019s fee. <em>Id. </em>at 29-30. Plaintiff filed suit in Illinois to recover the fee, and over defendant\u2019s jurisdictional objections, ultimately obtained a jury verdict on the merits. <em>Id. </em>at 28. Defendant appealed, contending in part that the Illinois court did not have <em>in personam </em>jurisdiction over defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-5\">The Appellate Court of Illinois affirmed the judgment of the trial court. <em>Id. </em>at 32. The Appellate Court first noted that, under the relevant Illinois cases, \u201c[pjersonal jurisdiction over a non-resident does not depend upon the physical presence of the defendant within the state____\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 30. It also noted that even a single business transaction can confer jurisdiction where \u201cthe act or transaction itself has a substantial connection with the forum state.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>The court went on to hold that the single business transaction at issue there constituted the \u201cnecessary jurisdictional minimum contacts for the purposes of in personam jurisdiction over this defendant,\u201d stating in pertinent part that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b430-8\">[a]n employment agency\u2019s business is to put a prospective employee in touch with a prospective employer, and the agency\u2019s services end once the two principals are made aware of each other\u2019s identities so that negotiations can be commenced between them. Although defendant\u2019s only contact within this state was a telephone Call, that call was all that was necessary for defendant to achieve its purpose. Once defendant informed plaintiff that it was interested in a certain person to fill a position and agreed to pay plaintiff\u2019s referral fee if it eventually hired that person, defendant knew, or should have known, that it had entered into a contract with an Illinois agency, that the agency would perform its services .from its office in Illinois, that the fee, if due, would be paid to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>plaintiff in Illinois, and that if the fee were not paid as promised, defendant might be liable to suit in the Illinois courts. <em>[Id. </em>at 31].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b431-7\">It is undisputed that here, as in <em>Cook Associates, </em>the nonresident defendant solicited a transaction with a resident employment agency which defendant knew or should have known would be performed by the agency from its office located within the foreign state. Hence, we conclude that because defendant solicited plaintiff to perform services on defendant\u2019s behalf in Wisconsin and both parties took action in furtherance of that agreement, due process does not prevent <em>in personam </em>jurisdiction in Wisconsin in an action arising out of that very agreement. <em>Compare, e.g., Lakeside Bridge &amp; Steel Co. v. Mountain State Construction Co., </em>597 F.2d 596 (7th Cir.1979), <em>cert. denied, </em>445 <em>U.S. </em>907, 100 <em>S.Ct. </em>1087, 63 L.Ed.2d 325 (1980) <em>with Madison Consulting Group v.

Mecure, </em>58 <em>N.J. </em>264, 272 (1971) (although defendant, a New York resident, entered this State to discuss the contract, the Court noted that \u201c[d]efendant ordered rivets from the plaintiff corporation and he knew that his order would have significant effects in New Jersey since it was anticipated that the plaintiff would either manufacture the rivets here or obtain them from some other source.\u201d); <em>Wolpert v.

Defendant makes no claim that it was not on notice of the pendency of the Wisconsin proceedings, or that it had no opportunity to defend against plaintiffs Wisconsin complaint. Nor does defendant claim that Wisconsin did not have jurisdiction under its own statutes or that judgment was not entered there in accordance with local procedure. <em>See World-Wide Volkswagen Corp. v.
