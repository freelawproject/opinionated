The plaintiff, Hartford Electric Light Co., on June 22, 1977, obtained the appointment of a receiver pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 16-262L The defendant, Stanley Y. Tucker, immediately appealed from that and related orders, challenging both their propriety and their constitutionality. The Appellate Session of the Superior Court found no error; <em>Hartford Electric Light Co. </em>v. <em>Tucker, </em>35 Conn. Sup. 609, 401 A.2d 454 (1978); and this court denied certification; 176 Conn. 765, 394 A.2d 202 (1978). The orders challenged by the defendant\u2019s present appeals arise out of the judgment rendered on November 14,1978, and supplemented on June 22, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>1979, in which, after hearing, the utility receivership was terminated and certain costs and fees were assessed.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-5\">The underlying facts are undisputed at this time. The plaintiff initiated a statutory action pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 16-262f<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> for the appointment of a receiver of rents for a number of apartment buildings owned by the defendant. After a hearing in June, 1977, the trial court, <em>Allen, J., </em>found the defendant to be indebted to the plaintiff for $9031.77 and appointed a receiver. That receiver was subsequently replaced by Timothy W. McNally by an order of the trial court, <em>Kinney, J., </em>on November 18,1977. After a number of interim proceedings to implement the utility receivership, that receivership was terminated on November 14, 1978, by the trial court, <em>N. O\u2019Neill, J., </em>and control of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>properties was transferred to a foreclosure receivership initiated by several banks bolding mortgages on the subject properties. Only issues arising out of the utility receivership are presently before us, since this appeal is limited to disputes between this plaintiff and the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-5\">The defendant, appearing pro se, claims that the trial court erred in its approval and administration of the utility receivership, in its award of attorney\u2019s fees, in its approval of the report of the rent receiver, and in its award of fees to the rent receiver. We note that our review of the defendant\u2019s claims is complicated by the absence of an adequate record. Although mindful of the solicitude afforded to pro se litigants, we can only consider those claims concerning which we have enough information for the review process to operate.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>I</p>\n<p id=\"b103-5\">The defendant\u2019s first three claims of error challenge the constitutionality of the utility receivership. The defendant cannot now relitigate the propriety of the receivership per se, because that question was decided against him in the earlier proceedings in the Appellate Session. <em>Hartford Electric Light Co. </em>v. <em>Tucker, </em>35 Conn. Sup. 609, 401 A.2d 454 (1978). Res judicata bars a second adjudication here of the facial constitutionality of General Statutes \u00a7 16-262f. <em>Corey </em>v. <em>Avco-Lycoming Division, </em>163 Conn. 309, 316-17, 307 A.2d 155 (1972), cert. denied, 409 U.S. 1116, 93 S. Ct. 903, 34 L. Ed. 2d 699 (1973); <em>Bridgeport Hydraulic Co. </em>v. <em>Pearson, </em>139 Conn. 186, 196, 91 A.2d 778 (1952).</p>\n<p id=\"b103-6\">There is no authority in law for the defendant\u2019s allegation that the trial court was constitutionally required to appoint him as rent receiver upon his offer to file an appropriate bond. The cases on which he relies, in which the Supreme Court of the United States has developed standards of procedural due process in the area of property rights, are all cases distinguishable from the present litigation, since they all involved prejudgment remedies. See, e.g., <em>North Georgia Finishing, Inc. </em>v. <em>Di-Chem, Inc., </em>419 U.S. 601, 95 S. Ct. 719, 42 L. Ed. 2d 751 (1975); <em>Mitchell </em>v. <em>W. T. Grant Co., </em>416 U.S. 600, 94 S. Ct. 1895, 40 L. Ed. 2d 406 (1974); <em>Fuentes </em>v. <em>Shevin, </em>407 U.S. 67, 92 S. Ct. 1983, 32 L. Ed. 2d 556, reh. denied, 409 U.S. 902, 93 S. Ct. 177, 34 L. Ed. 2d 165 (1972). While a putative debtor may have a constitutionally protected right to substitute a bond for a lien <em>before </em>there has been a judgment against him, he has no such right, under the cases and the statutes, <em>after </em>there has been a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>judgment, upon a hearing, affirming his indebtedness. Our statutes permitting dissolution of a lien upon the substitution of a bond are addressed, as were the statutes involved in the Supreme Court cases, to prejudgment liens. See General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 52-304 (attachment lien) and 49-37 (mechanic\u2019s lien).</p>\n<p id=\"b104-5\">There is no basis in fact for the defendant\u2019s allegation that he was not given sufficient notice of the dissolution hearing in the trial court that accepted the receiver\u2019s report and terminated the utility receivership. In his letter dated November 2, 1978, to the presiding judge, Judge O\u2019Neill, the defendant expressly acknowledged receipt of a letter from counsel for the plaintiff concerning the disputed November 14,1978 hearing. We have been referred to no other record concerning the procedures at that hearing. In the absence of a transcript, we cannot look behind the presumption of regularity of service of process and of notice that attaches to judicial proceedings in courts of general jurisdiction. See <em>Monroe </em>v. <em>Monroe, </em>177 Conn. 173, 185, 413 A.2d 819, appeal dismissed, cert. denied, 444 U.S. 801, 100 S. Ct. 20, 62 L. Ed. 2d 14 (1979); <em>Lampson Lumber Co. </em>v. <em>Hoer, </em>139 Conn. 294, 298, 93 A.2d 143 (1952). There is therefore no evidence to support the defendant\u2019s assertion that he was denied procedural due process.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-6\">We conclude therefore that the defendant\u2019s direct constitutional challenges to General Statutes \u00a7 16-262f must fail. The statute adequately provided him with an effective opportunity to be heard and with proper notice thereof. The defendant had the right, at a number of different junctures, to present evidence and to cross-examine the plaintiff\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>witnesses. In contradistinction to General Statutes \u00a7 49-14, the mortgage foreclosure statute found unconstitutional in <em>Society for Savings </em>v. <em>Chestnut Estates, Inc., </em>176 Conn. 563, 573-77, 409 A.2d 1020 (1979), this statute does not violate procedural due process on its face and did not violate procedural due process as applied in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b105-5\">The defendant\u2019s next claims of error relate to the award of attorney\u2019s fees and costs in the amount of $5091.71 and $2631.58. The utility receivership statute expressly provides that \u201c[t]he owner . . . shall he liable to the petitioner for reasonable attorney\u2019s fees and costs incurred by the petitioner.\u201d The defendant challenges this provision as being unconstitutionally devoid of standards, and challenges the trial court\u2019s findings pursuant thereto. We find no error in either regard.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-6\">The defendant\u2019s attack on the constitutionality of a statutory provision for \u201creasonable attorney\u2019s fees and costs\u201d as devoid of standards cannot be sustained. Statutes providing for an award of attorney\u2019s fees customarily state no other limitation than reasonableness; see, e.g., General Statutes \u00a7\u00a74-197, 22a-44, 33-334, 36-407, 36-449, 47a-18, 52-251; 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 15; 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988; nor would any other limitation appear to be practicable. The defendant\u2019s constitutional protection from excessive awards is to be found in the undisputed requirement that the reasonableness of attorney\u2019s fees and costs must be proven by an appropriate evidentiary showing. See <em>Stelco Industries, Inc. </em>v. <em>Cohen, 182 </em>Conn. 561, 567-68, 438 A.2d 759 (1980). Procedural due process is accorded to the defendant because he is provided the opportunity to present evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>of his own and to cross-examine the witnesses of the plaintiff with respect to the question of reasonableness. See <em>Society for Savings </em>v. <em>Chestnut Estates, Inc., </em>supra. The defendant has cited no case, nor have we discovered any, that establishes any further constitutional requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-5\">The defendant makes a two-pronged attack on the trial court\u2019s factual finding as to fees and costs. On the one hand, the defendant urges that Judge O\u2019Neill was precluded from awarding fees higher than those previously ordered by Judge Kinney, in his order of November 4, 1977. Judge Kinney\u2019s order was, however, expressly made \u201csubject to further order of this Court ... by way of approval of applications for receiver\u2019s fees and costs and attorney\u2019s fees and costs,\u201d and, thus, by its own terms permitted further awards by Judge O\u2019Neill. On the other hand, the defendant urges that the sums awarded were unreasonable. Since the award of attorney\u2019s fees and costs constitutes a finding of fact, our review of the award is limited to a determination of whether the decision of the trier was clearly erroneous in light of the evidence and the pleadings in the record as a whole. Practice Book \u00a730601); <em>Stelco Industries, Inc. </em>v. <em>Cohen, </em>supra; <em>Pandolphe\u2019s Auto Parts, Inc. </em>v. <em>Manchester, </em>181 Conn. 217, 221-22, 435 A.2d 24 (1980). We find no error in the decision of the trier with regard to its factual finding that attorney\u2019s fees of $5091.71 and costs of $2631.58 were reasonable. It may well be true that awards based on hourly rates may under some circumstances be inappropriate, but the defendant has produced no evidence that the trier was bound to believe that consideration of hours spent and of reasonable hourly rates was inappropriate in this case. The defendant\u2019s asser<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>tion that the attorney was incompetent was likewise an assertion to be evaluated by the trier of fact and not by this court. Finally, the trier was entitled to consider reasonable the time and effort expended by the attorney in defending his client in various federal court proceedings even though the federal court, operating under different guidelines,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> did not award such fees. In short, all of the defendant\u2019s complaints about the attorney\u2019s fees were matters to be considered by the trial court in its determination of what was reasonable in light of all of the circumstances before it. See <em>King </em>v. <em>Green-blatt, </em>560 F.2d 1024, 1026 (1st Cir. 1977). Nothing that has been presented on this appeal warrants our redetermination of the trial court\u2019s findings of fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b107-6\">The defendant\u2019s claims of error with regard to the trial court\u2019s acceptance of the final report of the receiver McNally charge failures of management and accounting with respect to the receivership. The defendant also alleges that, upon termination of the utility receivership, proceeds were available that should have been disbursed to him. None of these claims can survive the factual findings of the trial court to the contrary; again no evidentiary basis has been provided for a challenge in this court to these findings. Since, as we have concluded, Judge O\u2019Neill had the power to assess the receivership with costs and fees greater than those initially awarded, on an interim basis, by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>Judge Kinney, Ms power extended to the expenses incident to the receivership as well as to the fees properly charged by the plaintiffs attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-5\">The defendant\u2019s underlying challenge to the administration of the reeeiversMp appears to rest on the perceived injustice of permitting a utility receivership to take rent receipts as a first lien, without regard to the costs of maintenance or mortgage obligations. It may well be true that utility receiverships will often, as in this case, lead to foreclosure receiverships and thus risk further impairment of inner city housing stock. This court is, however, not the proper audience to which to address such arguments of public policy. <em>Laurel Bank &amp; Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Mark Ford, Inc., </em>182 Conn. 437, 442-43, 438 A.2d 705 (1980); <em>General Motors Corporation </em>v. <em>Mulquin, </em>134 Conn. 118, 132, 55 A.2d 732 (1947). The legislature might have concluded that a utility receivership is a remedy required as a tradeoff for the limitation imposed on the utility\u2019s right to terminate service for nonpayment of utility bills. Such limitations were enacted as part of the same legislation, Public Acts 1975, No. 75-625,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> now General Statutes \u00a7 16-262c et seq., as that authorizing the utility reeeiversMp.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-6\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b108-7\">The defendant\u2019s final claims of error challenge the award of fees to the receiver McNally for his services during the utility receivership.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In large <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>part, these claims duplicate the defendant\u2019s challenge to the award of attorney\u2019s fees, discussed earlier in this opinion. Again we note that the utility receivership statute, General Statutes \u00a7 16-262f, expressly authorizes the award of \u201creasonable fees and costs determined by the court to be due the receiver.\u201d Again we reiterate that the defendant has provided this court with no basis upon which to find error in the determination of Judge O\u2019Neill that he had the authority to award McNally a fee of $12,000 (less the sums previously awarded by Judge O\u2019Donnell, plus costs). The trial court expressly found that the receiver \u201chas spent over 300 hours working on this case. He has been diligent in the face of enormous interference from the defendant.\u201d Such interference is documented by the earlier judgment of the trial court, <em>Satter, J., </em>holding the defendant in contempt, pursuant to \u00a7 16-262f (d), for collecting rents that were to have been turned over to the receiver. There is therefore no justification for the defendant\u2019s attack on Judge O\u2019Neill\u2019s conclusions of fact and law. See <em>Jacobs </em>v. <em>Ringling Bros.-Barnum &amp; Bailey Combined Shows, Inc., </em>141 Conn. 86, 94, 103 A.2d 805 (1954). We note in particular that the defendant\u2019s claim of bias and prejudice on the part of Judge O\u2019Neill is completely unwarranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-4\">The defendant raises two further challenges to the legality of Judge O\u2019Neill\u2019s award. One argument reiterates the proposition, addressed earlier in this opinion, that \u00a7 16-262f is constitutionally deficient in failing to set adequate standards for the award of fees and costs. The second argument suggests that the Connecticut Anti-Trust Act; General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 35-24 through 35-45; bars an award to the receiver at the rate of $40 per hour because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>the plaintiff allegedly contracted and conspired with the receiver to fix prices for his services at an unreasonably high \u201cattorney rate\u201d for work that could have been done less expensively by someone who was not an attorney. This second argument was not presented to the trial court, and there is no evidence whatsoever before us that supports it. We are therefore not able to respond to it in any fashion.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-5\">There is no error in the appeal in case No. 10198 or in the appeal in ease No. 10083.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-6\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b101-6\"> General Statutes \u00a7 16-262\u00cd provides, in relevant part: \u201cpetition FOR RECEIVER OF RENTS; HEARING; APPOINTMENT; DUTIES. TERMINATION OF RECEIVERSHIP. NONEXCLUSIVITY OF REMEDY.

Any monies from rental payments or payments for use and occupancy remaining after payment for current electric, gas . . . service, and after payment for reasonable costs and fees to the receiver, and after payment to petitioner for reasonable attorney\u2019s fees and costs, shall be applied to any arrearage found by the court to be due and owing the company . . . from the owner . . . for service provided such building.
