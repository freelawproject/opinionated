Healey, J.</author>\n<p id=\"ACd\">This is an action seeking injunctive relief<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> brought by the plaintiffs, who are the owners of certain vacant properties in the defendant city of Milford, against the city, seeking to restrain it and certain of its officials from taking any action against them under the Milford Housing Code.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> After a full hearing, the court dissolved the ex parte temporary injunction it had issued at the outset of the action, and denied permanent injunc-tive relief. The plaintiffs have appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>In 1979, the defendant city undertook action, under the Milford Housing Code, against certain vacant properties owned by the plaintiffs. Proceeding under section 11<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> of that code, the city\u2019s health department inspected sixteen residential properties owned by the plaintiffs. The inspectors found violations of the code at each dwelling and so notified the plaintiffs. The notices advised the plaintiffs that their dwellings were posted as \u201cUnfit for Occupancy,\u201d notified them of the specific violations at each dwelling, and ordered the plaintiffs to repair or demolish the dwelling within thirty days. The plaintiffs did not comply within the time provided in the notices, and the city sought arrest warrants for the plaintiffs under section 12<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> of the code. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>plaintiffs instituted the present action which sought to enjoin the city \u201cfrom proceeding in any manner under the Milford Housing Code against the plaintiffs or with respect to any buildings owned by them or in which they have any interest.\u201d Their complaint alleged, inter alia, that the Milford Housing Code did not apply to their vacant dwellings, that the code was invalid and void in its entirety in that it was preempted by the State Building Code, adopted under General Statutes 'V\\&gt; 19-395 through 19-403, and that it was unconstitutional because of the lack of reasonably clear standards and of rules of procedure.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b185-5\">This ease reaches us in an unusual posture in the light of the pleadings and the trial court\u2019s determination under the claims of the parties. The trial court, as the judge of the credibility of the witnesses, found credible Dr. Bencivenga\u2019s testimony that she and her husband intended to fix up and use all their houses, including those sixteen concerning which the notices in question were received. Thus, having also determined that the houses involved were \u201cdwellings\u201d under section 2.3<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> of the Milford Housing Code, the court said that \u201cthere is no problem in the case about the theoretical application of the [Milford] Housing Code to vacant houses not intended <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>to be used for human occupancy.\u201d It therefore concluded that it did \u201cnot have to pass on the question whether the [Milford] Housing Code is preempted by the State Building Code as to such vacant buildings.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b186-5\">The trial court was in error in not deciding the issue of preemption as it related to the plaintiffs\u2019 properties.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The plaintiffs had placed that issue squarely before the trial court. In fact, the city argued in its trial memorandum that \u201cif the affected structures . . . are indeed, \u2018dwellings,\u2019 the Court must consider whether the pertinent sections of the [Milford] Housing Code are subject to preemption by the State Building Code.\u201d It should, however, be pointed out that the plaintiffs\u2019 complaint, fairly read, asks the invalidation of the Milford Housing Code in its entirety on the ground of preemption by the State Building Code, while in oral argument before us, the plaintiffs argued the invalidity of only sections 11 and 12' of the code.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-6\">Generally speaking, the Milford Housing Code and the State Building Code appear to deal with the same subject matter. When a statute and an ordinance which deal with the same subject matter conflict, the statute prevails. <em>Sheehan </em>v. <em>Altschuler, </em>148 Conn. 517, 521, 172 A.2d 897 (1961); <em>State </em>v. <em>Gordon, </em>143 Conn. 698, 706, 125 A.2d 477 (1956); <em>Shelton </em>v. <em>City of Shelton, </em>111 Conn. 433, 438, 150 A. 811 (1930); see 6 McQuillin, Municipal Corporations (3d Ed. Rev.) \u00a7 21.32. The power of the city <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>to enact the ordinance which is the Milford Housing Code depends primarily upon whether it is in conflict with, or inconsistent with, the State Building Code. See <em>Shelton </em>v. <em>City of Shelton, </em>supra, 438. There is attached to every ordinance, charter or resolution adopted by or affecting a municipality the implied condition that these must yield to the predominant power of the state when that power has been exercised. See 6 McQuillin, op. cit., \u00a7 21.32. This is in keeping with our law that a municipality, as a creature of the state \u201ccan exercise only such powers as are expressly granted it or such powers as are necessary to enable it to discharge the duties and carry into effect the objects and purposes of its creation.\u201d <em>New Haven Water Co. </em>v. <em>New Haven, </em>152 Conn. 563, 566, 210 A.2d 449 (1965); see <em>Baker </em>v. <em>Norwalk, </em>152 Conn. 312, 314, 206 A.2d428 (1965); <em>Bredice </em>v. <em>Norwalk, </em>152 Conn. 287, 292, 206 A.2d 433 (1964); <em>Ingham </em>v. <em>Brooks, </em>95 Conn. 317, 328-29, 111 A. 209 (1920).</p>\n<p id=\"b187-5\">Brief reference to certain provisions of the State Building Code and the Milford Housing Code serves to indicate that the trial court should have decided the preemption claim. For purposes of our disposition of this appeal, we emphasize that we do not undertake any detailed analysis of these two codes. We make no conclusions with regard to the issue of preemption and only discuss the two codes in general terms to illustrate our conclusion that the trial court erred in not deciding the issue.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b187-6\">The purpose of the Milford Housing Code as set out in section 1 is \u201cto insure safe, sanitary and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>decent housing\u201d and it \u201capplies to every structure used for living purposes.\u201d Section 19-395-100.0 of the regulations of the State Building Code, or Basic Code, which is entitled \u201cScope,\u201d provides in part: \u201c[the regulations] shall control all matters concerning the construction, alteration, addition, repair, removal, demolition, use, location, occupancy and maintenance of all buildings and structures . . . except as such matters are required to be otherwise controlled by provision of the General Statutes, or the further rules and regulations authorized for promulgation under the provisions of the Basie Code.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b188-5\">The orders directed to the plaintiffs\u2019 properties under the Milford Housing Code ordered that they be repaired or, failing that, be demolished. The trial court specifically found that the Milford Housing Code \u201cdoes not authorize demolition\u201d but that \u201cdemolition would seem to be a logical course to follow to correct any violations specified.\u201d The State Building Code, \u00a7 19-395-124.1 entitled \u201cRight of Condemnation\u201d provides: \u201cAll buildings or structures that are or hereafter shall become unsafe, unsanitary, or deficient in adequate exitway facilities, or which constitute a fire hazard, or are otherwise dangerous to human life or the public welfare, or which by reason of illegal or improper use, occupancy or maintenance, shall be deemed unsafe buildings or structures. All unsafe buildings shall be taken down and removed or made safe and secure, as the building official may deem necessary and as provided in this section. A vacant building, unguarded or open at door or window, shall be deemed a fire hazard and unsafe within the meaning of the Basic Code.\u201d Section 19-395-124.3 of the State Code provides for notification to the owner <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>of a building or structure deemed unsafe of the specific repairs to be made or the demolition that may also be ordered. Section 12 of the Milford Housing Code provides that: \u201cAny person who shall violate any provision of this ordinance may upon conviction be punished by a fine of not more than one hundred ($100.) dollars, or by imprisonment for not more than thirty (30) days and, each day\u2019s failure to comply with any such provision shall constitute a separate violation.\u201d The State Building Code, however, does not specifically provide criminal sanctions<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> for property owners, but provides that the building official may, after notification to the property owner and refusal or neglect by the owner to comply -with the order, cause the required repairs or demolition to be done at the owner\u2019s expense. See State Building Code Regulations \u00a7 19-395-124.6.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-5\">These examples demonstrate at least some apparent conflicts which required that the trial court reach and resolve the issue of preemption. Without having disposed of this threshold question, the factual determination that the court did make under the Milford Housing Code in its disposition of the case cannot stand. This is so because the validity of the very ordinance itself, i.e., the Milford Housing Code, was frontally attacked on the ground of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>preemption,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> and, therefore, that issue had to he resolved before the case could be disposed of below, even on the factual basis of credibility of testimony, under the Milford Housing Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-5\">Where a court erroneously fails to adjudicate an issue, the proper judgment ordinarily is to remand the case so that the court may adjudicate the issue. <em>Alderman </em>v. <em>Hanover Ins. Group, </em>155 Conn. 585, 591, 236 A.2d 462 (1967); <em>Cochran </em>v. <em>McLaughlin, </em>128 Conn. 638, 644, 24 A.2d 836 (1942). In this case, we agree with both counsel that the issue of preemption should first be ruled upon by the trial court since \u201c \u2018[wjhether the legislature has undertaken to occupy exclusively a given field of legislation is to be determined in every case upon an analysis of the statute, and of the facts and circumstances upon which it intended to operate.\u2019 \u201d 6 McQuillin, Municipal Corporations (3d Ed. Rev.) \u00a7 21.34.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-6\">There is error, the judgment is set aside and a new trial is ordered.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-7\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b183-10\">The plaintiffs\u2019 complaint also sought damages, but that relief is not relevant to our disposition of this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b183-11\"> The Milford ordinance which is involved in this appeal is entitled \u201cHousing Ordinance Regulating Supplied Facilities, Maintenance and Occupancy of Dwelling and Dwelling Units\u201d enacted in 1963.

Here, the plaintiffs are challenging the very validity of the ordinance itself and the city\u2019s jurisdiction to take action under it.
