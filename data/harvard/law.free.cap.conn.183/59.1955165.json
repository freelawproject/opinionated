Healey, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AYW\">This is an action involving the Connecticut Marketable Record Title Act, General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 47-33b through <em>47-331. </em>The plaintiff challenged, in the first count of his complaint,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the validity of a notice of claim filed in the Norwich land records by the defendants pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 47-33f (a).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Both parties filed motions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>for summary judgment on this issue.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Judgment was rendered in favor of the plaintiff on both motions. The defendants have appealed from the final judgment rendered on the summary judgment motions.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-6\">The defendants are the owners in fee simple of a parcel of land situated generally northwesterly of the plaintiff\u2019s land. They contend that attached to their land is a twenty-five foot wide easement running along the westerly boundary of the plaintiff\u2019s land. In claiming that this easement is a valid easement over the plaintiff\u2019s land, the defendants also argue that the root of title of the plaintiff\u2019s land over which the easement is claimed is a warranty deed recorded on June 5, 1885, in the Norwich land records. The warranty deed creating the easement was recorded in the Norwich land records on May 9, 1895, and it conveyed the premises presently owned by the defendants together with this easement of a right of way across land remaining in the grantor of the deed of May 9, 1895. On July 18, 1974, the defendants\u2019 decedent and predecessor in title recorded in the Norwich land records an instrument entitled \u201cNotice of Interest in Land\u201d in which she <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>claimed that the plaintiff\u2019s land was servient to the easement of a right of way created by the warranty deed recorded on May 9, 1895.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b76-4\">The plaintiff brought this action contesting the legal viability of the defendants\u2019 easement as a burden on his land. He claimed that the recording of the \u201cNotice of Interest in Land\u201d on July 18,1974, was ineffective as against his land because the notice was not filed on or before July 1, 1971, in accordance with General Statutes $ 47-33L.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b76-5\">The trial court ruled in favor of the plaintiff\u2019s motion for summary judgment. In its memorandum of decision, the court apparently believed that both parties agreed that the plaintiff\u2019s root of title was a deed recorded in 1895. In its memorandum, the court said, \u201c[t]here are no disputed facts in this action. Both parties have sought summary judgments. The Defendant admits in paragraph eight of its submitted affidavit [on the defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment] and in paragraph one of its memorandum that the Plaintiff\u2019s root of title is a deed recorded in 1895. . . . The Defendants themselves have conceded that the true \u2018root of title\u2019 of the Plaintiff exists in the 1895 recording. . .\"<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>Upon review, the defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment shows that the defendants claimed that the plaintiff\u2019s root of title was not recorded in 1895, hut was recorded in 1885. In fact, there is nothing before us to indicate that either party alleged in the trial court that the plaintiff\u2019s root of title was recorded in 1895. Since the trial court\u2019s decision on the summary judgment motions was based on the mistaken belief that the plaintiff\u2019s root of title was recorded in 1895, it was clearly erroneous. See Practice Book \u00a7 3060D; see also <em>Stoni </em>v. <em>Wasicki, </em>179 Conn. 372, 377, 426 A.2d 774 (1979).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b77-6\">In his motion for summary judgment, the plaintiff did not set forth what he claimed as his root of title. For the first time, he now strongly argues in this court, on the basis of a sketch of the property involved introduced by the defendants in the trial court, that his root of title is \u201ca title transaction recorded in [the] Norwich Land Records, Book of Wills, Page 90\u201d in 1896, and referred to in a deed recorded on February 18, 1905.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-7\">The date of the plaintiff\u2019s root of title of that land over which the defendants claim the easement (hereinafter servient estate) is dispositive of this appeal.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The Marketable Record Title Act provides that: \u201c \u2018Root of title\u2019 means that conveyance or other title transaction in the chain of title of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>person, purporting to create or containing language sufficient to transfer the interest claimed by such person, upon which he relies as a basis for the marketability of his title, and which was the most recent to be recorded as of a date forty years prior to the time when marketability is being determined. The effective date of the root of title is the date on which it is recorded.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 47-33b (e).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> In the present action, the date \u201cwhen marketability is being determined\u201d is July 18, 1974. Under the act, any person who has an unbroken record chain of title to an interest in land for a period of forty years, plus any additional period of time necessary to trace the title back to the latest connecting title instrument of earlier record (which is the \u201croot of title\u201d under the act) has a \u201cmarketable record title\u201d subject only to those pre-root of title matters that are excepted under the statute or are caused to reappear in the latest forty year record chain of title. General Statutes \u00a7 47-33c.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>Therefore, if the plaintiff\u2019s root of title of the servient estate is a \u201cconveyance or other title transaction\u201d recorded after the date when the \u201cconveyance or other title transaction\u201d granting the easement in question to the defendants\u2019 predecessor in title was recorded, then unless one of the exceptions listed in \u00a7 47-33d apply, the defendants would have had to file a notice of claim by July 1,1971, in order to preserve their interest. General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 47-33e,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> 47-33c, 47-33f, 47-33l. If, however, the \u201cconveyance or other title transaction\u201d creating the easement was recorded after the date of the plaintiff\u2019s root of title, then the defendants\u2019 interest in the easement is still valid. General Statutes \u00a7 47-33d.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b80-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>An examination of the record, brief s and exhibits before us leads us to the conclusion that the plaintiff\u2019s root of title of the servient estate, i.e., the land over which the defendants\u2019 easement runs, is the deed recorded in June, 1885. Concerning the 1896 \u201ctitle transaction\u201d upon which the plaintiff relies as his root of title, it suffices to point out that it relates to other land now owned by the plaintiff but not to the servient estate.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Thus, the defendants\u2019 interest is valid as against the plaintiff because it comes within that exception set out in General Statutes \u00a7 47-33d which provides \u201c[s]uch marketable record title shall be subject to: . . . (d) any interest arising out of a title transaction which has been recorded subsequent to the effective date of the root of title from which the unbroken chain of title of record is started. . .\"<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The defendants\u2019 interest arose out of the title transaction recorded in 1895 which created the easement and was subsequent to the effective date of the plaintiff\u2019s root of title, i.e., the warranty deed recorded in June, 1885, from which the unbroken chain of title of record to the servient estate started. Thus, General Statutes \u00a7 47-33? does not operate to bar the validity of the defendants\u2019 interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>There is error, the judgment on the first count is set aside, and the case is remanded with direction to vacate the judgment on the first count for the plaintiff and to enter judgment on the first count for the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-6\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b74-11\"> The plaintiff\u2019s complaint was in two counts: the first count challenged the validity of the notice of claim of interest in land filed by the defendants. The second count alleged the slandering of the plaintiff\u2019s title by the filing of the notice of claim. The trial court found for the defendants on the second count after a trial. This appeal is from the trial court\u2019s action on the summary judgment issue under the first count only.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b74-12\"> General Statutes \u00a747-33f (a) provides: \u201c(a) Any person claiming an interest of any kind in land may preserve and keep effective sueh interest by recording, during the forty-year period immediately following the effective date of the root of title of the person whose <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>record title would otherwise be marketable, a notice in writing, duly verified by oath, setting forth the nature of the claim. No disability or lack of knowledge of any kind on the part of anyone shall suspend the running of such forty-year period. Such notiee may be recorded by the claimant or by any other person acting on behalf of any claimant who is: (1) Under a disability, (2) unable to assert a claim on his own behalf or (3) one of a class, but whose identity cannot be established or is uncertain at the time of filing such notice of claim for record.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b75-9\"> The plaintiff's motion for summary judgment maintained that there was no genuine issue of material fact with respect to the \u201cinvalidity\u201d of the notice of interest in land filed by the defendants. The defendants\u2019 motion maintained the same with respect to the \u201cvalidity\u201d of that notice.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b76-6\"> The \u201cNotice of Claim of Interest\u201d filed on July 18, 1974, claimed a twenty-five foot easement over the plaintiff\u2019s land and a ten foot easement over land of Joseph Dembo and Frances Segal, which latter strip abuts the plaintiff\u2019s land on the west. Neither Joseph Dembo nor Frances Segal is a party to this action. We now deal, as did the trial court, only with the twenty-five foot strip of the plaintiff\u2019s land which the defendants claim is servient to the easement recorded on May 9, 1895.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b76-7\"> General Statutes \u00a7 47-33Z provides: \u201cIf the forty-year period specified in sections 47-33b to 47-33k, inclusive, has expired prior to two years after July 1, 1969, such period shall be extended two years after July 1, 1969.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b76-9\"> In oral argument before us, both counsel agreed that in both instances just quoted, \u201c1895\u201d should have been \u201c1885.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b77-9\"> In its \u201cMemorandum of Decision on Defendant\u2019s Motion to Beopen the (Summary) Judgment\u201d the trial court said \u201c[t]he root of title, the defendants claim, is a deed recorded June 5, 1885 The trial court denied the motion to reopen which alleged that the decision on the motion for summary judgment \u201cwas based upon the misinterpretation of the facts and law.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b77-15\"> We have had occasion to observe that the question of whether certain deeds and other written instruments establish record title in a party is a question of law for the court. See <em>Merwin </em>v. <em>Morris, </em>71 Conn. 555, 42 A. 855 (1899).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b78-6\"> It has been said that \u201c[t]he ultimate purpose of all the Marketable Title Acts is to simplify land title transactions through making it possible to determine marketability by limited title searches over some reasonable period of the immediate past and thus avoid the necessity of examining the record back into distant time for each new transaction.\u201d Basye, Clearing Land Titles (2d Ed.) \u00a7 172, p. 368.
