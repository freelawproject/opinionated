The trial court held the four minor defendants to be liable to the named plaintiff, Christopher Lamb, for $3000 damages and to be liable to Lamb\u2019s father for $540.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The court held the parents of the four minor defendants jointly and severally liable for $1500 in damages because it concluded that the minors wilfully and maliciously caused Lamb\u2019s injuries. On appeal, the defendants<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> challenge the court\u2019s conclusion that the defendants\u2019 action was wilful and malicious within the meaning of General Statutes \u00a7 52-572<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> (as it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>existed in 1975) and its finding that the minor defendants\u2019 action was sufficiently united to support a judgment of joint and several liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-6\">With respect to the court\u2019s conclusion that the minor defendants acted together, we cannot say that the court\u2019s determination was clearly erroneous. See Practice Book \u00a7 3060D. There was testimony that all four minor defendants encircled Lamb, blocking his escape. All four caused him to be knocked to the ground. Each of the four either punched, kicked at or pushed him. We reject the defendants\u2019 contention that the four did not act in concert merely because the named defendant, Peck, concededly threw the punch that caused Lamb to lose three teeth. The other defendants\u2019 action in deliberately aiding Peck by blocking Lamb\u2019s escape, attempting to kick Lamb and knocking Lamb to the ground, amply justified the conclusion that the minors were acting in concert. See Restatement (Second), Torts \u00a7876 (a). \u201cWhere two or more persons unite in an act which constitutes a wrong to another, intending at the time to commit it, or in doing it under circumstances which fairly charge them with intending the consequences which follow, they incur a joint and several liability for the acts of each and all of the joint participants.\u2019 \u201d <em>Gutow-</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number><em>ski </em>v. <em>New Britain, </em>165 Conn. 50, 54, 327 A.2d 552 (1973). Where, as here, the evidence supports the conclusion that there was concerted action, each participant is vicariously liable for the entire injury caused by the concerted action. Prosser, Law of Torts \u00a7 46. Because each participant is vicariously liable for the damages caused by those with whom he acts, there is no logical basis upon which damages can be apportioned. See id., \u00a7 52.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-6\">The defendants also maintain that their conduct was not \u201cwilful and malicious\u201d as those words are used in General Statutes \u00a7 52-572. We disagree. The applicable statutory requirement for parental liability is that the minor wilfully or maliciously causes injury to a person. General Statutes \u00a7 52-572. We conclude that this requirement is met where a minor intentionally aids another who intentionally injures a third person. Because there was evidence indicating that all four minor defendants acted intentionally and in concert, the trial court correctly imposed liability on the defendant parents under \u00a7 52-572.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-7\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-8\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b485-10\"> This sum represents the amount of a medical bill paid by Lamb\u2019s father.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b485-11\"> Heither the named defendant nor his parents have appealed from the judgment rendered by the trial court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b485-12\"> \u201c[General Statutes] Sec. 52-572. parental liability por torts op minors, damage defined.
