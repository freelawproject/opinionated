The jury rendered a verdict in favor of the plaintiff in the amount of $283,162.44. The defendant filed a motion for judgment in favor of the defendant notwithstanding the verdict, a motion to set aside the jury verdict and order a new trial, and a motion to discharge an attachment. The court denied the motion for judgment but ordered the verdict set aside unless the plaintiff filed a remittitur in the amount of $251,525.54 which would effectively reduce the verdict to $31,636.90. The court further ordered that the prejudgment attachment be reduced from $300,000 to $35,000 if the remittitur is not filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-5\">The plaintiff moved to stay the order reducing the prejudgment attachment until this court had determined his appeal. The trial court denied the motion. The plaintiff thereafter filed a motion for review with this court and on November 28, 1979, this court vacated the trial court\u2019s order denying the plaintiff\u2019s motion for stay of execution of the modification of the prejudgment attachment. Accordingly, the original prejudgment remedy continues in effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-6\">The legal problems for which the plaintiff\u2019s services were rendered grew out of certain corporate manipulations which took place in 1969. The management of Consumers National Life Insurance Company of Indiana (Consumers Life), in an attempt to stop the United Founders Life Insurance Company of Oklahoma (Founders Life) from gaining control of it, sold to the defendant and his associates 280,000 shares of its common stock for $3,640,000, payable $280,000 in cash and $3,360,000 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>by way of a promissory note. The 280,000 shares of the Consumers Life stock were then pledged to secure payment of the note. As a result, the defendant and his associates gained control of Consumers Life.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-5\">Thereafter, Founders Life instituted an action against the defendant and his associates to declare the sale of the stock void, and to enjoin them from voting said stock. The stockholders of Consumers Life also brought suit against the defendant and his associates to set aside the sale of the stock and to recover damages for alleged violations of security and fiduciary laws. Thus, the defendant and his group found themselves in the position of being subject to liability for the $3,360,000 note plus interest at a time when there was a substantial drop in the market price of the stock of Consumers Life.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-6\">The defendant and his group were initially represented by a Stamford, Connecticut, law firm. The defendant, however, became dissatisfied with the fees charged by that firm. He later met with the plaintiff in New York and, after some discussion, entered into an agreement whereby the plaintiff would represent the defendant in the matter of his involvement with Consumers Life. No specific fee for those services was discussed or agreed upon by the parties. Some time later, the plaintiff received a call from another member of the defendant\u2019s group, a Mr. Arbour, who also retained him for the same purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-7\">The plaintiff was a member in good standing of the Connecticut bar, a graduate of Yale Law School and Harvard Business School and, at the time, was general counsel to a corporation located in New York City. He did not maintain an office in Connecti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>cut, except in Ms home. He had no office overhead and occasionally hired Yale law students to do his research.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-5\">The plaintiff performed his legal services over a period of approximately two years. They consisted of negotiating a settlement between the defendant and the stockholders of Consumers Life. This service required approximately 400 hours of the plaintiff\u2019s time, which included meetings in New York and Indiana. Local counsel in Indiana performed all the necessary legal services in court during the pendency of the litigation and in obtaining the court\u2019s approval of the settlement of the Founders Life suit and the Consumers Life stockholders suit, including the appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit. The plaintiff testified before the District Court for Indiana and perfunctorily participated in the services rendered by Indiana counsel. Local counsel in Indiana rendered a bill in the amount of $18,000 for his services to both the defendant and Mr. Arbour and he was paid in full.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-6\">The settlement provided that the 280,000 shares of stock would be returned to Consumers Life, that the note of $3,360,000 would be cancelled, and that the litigation instituted by Founders Life and the stockholders of Consumers Life would be withdrawn. It also provided that Consumers Life would retain the $280,000 down payment. The settlement, however, did not affect the defendant and his associates\u2019 claim against Founders Life for an alleged breach of an agreement which was subsequently settled for $50,000. In sum, the settlement negotiated by the plaintiff eventually placed the defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>and his associates in the position of losing $280,000 on the transaction less the net amount of $50,000 received by settlement from Founders Life.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-5\">On December 27, 1971, the plaintiff rendered to the defendant for his legal services the following bill in the amount of $1,128,432.44 for which he sought to charge the defendant one-half or the sum of $564,216.22:</p>\n<p id=\"b218-6\">\u201cFee for results achieved in the elimination of your liability to Consumers National Life Insurance Company calculated as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b218-7\">Original note - 3/25/\u201969 $ 3,360,000.00</p>\n<p id=\"b218-8\">Interest at 6% from 3/25/\u201969 to</p>\n<p id=\"b218-9\">11/18/\u201971 (date of release of</p>\n<p id=\"b218-10\">final instruments from escrow) 534,240.00</p>\n<p id=\"b218-11\">Total liability 3,894,240.00</p>\n<p id=\"b218-12\">Less: Possible recovery on a</p>\n<p id=\"b218-13\">forced sale of 280,000 shares of</p>\n<p id=\"b218-14\">letter stock at $.50 per share 140,000.00</p>\n<p id=\"b218-15\">Liability eliminated 3,754,240.00</p>\n<p id=\"b218-16\">Application of contingent fee factor of 30% to liability eliminated 1,126,270.00</p>\n<p id=\"b218-17\">Disbursements to 11/18/\u201971 2,162.44</p>\n<p id=\"b218-18\">Total contingent fee and</p>\n<p id=\"b218-19\">disbursements 1,128,432.44</p>\n<p id=\"b218-20\">Fifty percent of above total</p>\n<p id=\"b218-21\">representing your share of the</p>\n<p id=\"b218-22\">fee $ 564,216.22</p>\n<p id=\"b218-23\">lU. <em>Mm Mm Mm M- Mm </em>iU. <em>Mm M- Mm Mm Mm </em>JL <em>Mm</em></p>\n<p id=\"b218-24\">wwwwwffww\u00edrwwfl'\u00edT'Ir</p>\n<p id=\"b218-25\">together with interest at the rate of 8% per annum from this date to date of final payment.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-26\">-V. <em>Mm Mm ^ M- Mm mUm Mm Mm </em>\u00abU. <em>Mm Mm Mm Mm</em></p>\n<p id=\"b219-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>As set forth in my Memo of October 22,1971, the following factors were considered carefully in arriving at this fee:</p>\n<p id=\"b219-5\">1. the amount involved and the final results achieved, viz. a reduction in total liability of $3,754,240.00;</p>\n<p id=\"b219-6\">2. the legal difficulty and complexity of the matter, viz. removing this note and all accrued interest from the books of a publically [sic] held and regulated insurance company;</p>\n<p id=\"b219-7\">3. the experience, judgment, responsibility and initiative involved in conceiving the legal strategy and in following thru to the final result;</p>\n<p id=\"b219-8\">4. the going legal rates for such responsibility;</p>\n<p id=\"b219-9\">5. the fact that the fee was contingent on results achieved and for this one matter as opposed to a fee certain regardless of results, for a continuing client.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b219-10\">The plaintiff sought to charge the other half of the bill to Mr. Arbour. Mr. Arbour settled with the plaintiff by agreeing to pay him $150,000 as follows: $50,000 in cash and a $100,000 note payable on demand. The defendant refused to pay the bill rendered to him and the plaintiff commenced this action.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-11\">The plaintiff, in paragraph two of his complaint, alleged a cause of action based upon a contingency fee contract. The trial court did not allow this claim to be submitted to the jury. The plaintiff does not contest this action.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-12\">The case was submitted to the jury on a quantum meruit basis. The plaintiff contends that the trial court improperly instructed the jury that the eon-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>tingent nature of the agreement should not be taken into consideration in determining a reasonable fee. The court, in its charge to the jury, stated: \u201cAccordingly, the court as a matter of law instructs the jury that they are not to give any consideration to paragraph 2 of the complaint and not to take into consideration the allegations that the fee was contingent based upon results.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b220-5\">Generally, the contingent nature of a fee is a proper factor in the jury\u2019s determination of a reasonable attorneys\u2019 fee. 1 Speiser, Attorneys\u2019 Fees \u00a7 8:10. There are several general factors which may properly be considered in determining the amount to be allowed as reasonable compensation to an attorney. These factors are summarized in DR 2-106 of the Code of Professional Responsibility.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The fee arrangement here, however, was too indefinite to allow a contingency element to be considered by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>the jury.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> A contingent fee is one which will be paid to the attorney for his services only in case he wins; that is, a fee which is made to depend upon the success or failure to enforce a supposed right, and which is generally paid out of the recovery for the client. <em>Pocius </em>v. <em>Halvorsen, </em>30 Ill. 2d 73, 78, 195 N.E.2d 137 (1963). The fee discussion between the plaintiff and the defendant did not indicate that the plaintiff had the risk of receiving no fee at all. We agree with the decision of the trial court in instructing the jury not to consider this factor.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-4\">The plaintiff also claims the court erred in granting the motion to set aside the verdict as excessive, and that this deprives him of his constitutional right to a trial by jury. The court noted that the services the plaintiff rendered for the defendant were performed competently and in a manner consistent with the best standards of the legal profession, but that they did not require an extraordinary degree of skill. It then concluded that the jury must have been influenced by mistake; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>that with all dne deference to the constitutional right to a trial by jury, the award far exceeded the bounds of legitimate generosity; and that the award shocked the court\u2019s sense of justice and was excessive whether based upon 1970 standards or those of 1978.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-4\">The trial court has the inherent power to set aside a jury verdict which, in the court\u2019s opinion, is either against the law or the evidence. Maltbie, Conn. App. Proc. \u00a7 181. Pursuant to this power, the trial court has the right and duty to set aside a verdict as being excessive or inadequate. <em>Lengel </em>v. <em>New Haven Gas Light Co., </em>142 Conn. 70, 78, 111 A.2d 547 (1955). When the amount of damages awarded is at issue, the relevant inquiry is whether the verdict falls within the necessarily uncertain limits of fair and reasonable compensation or whether it so shocks the conscience as to compel the conclusion that it was due to partiality, prejudice or mistake. <em>Sellner </em>v. <em>Beechwood Construction Co., </em>176 Conn. 432, 438, 407 A.2d 1026 (1979); <em>Thomas </em>v. <em>Katz, </em>171 Conn. 412, 416, 370 A.2d 978 (1976); <em>Lee </em>v. <em>Lee, </em>171 Conn. 1, 3, 368 A.2d 11 (1976); <em>Gorczyca </em>v. <em>New York, N.H. &amp; H. R. Co., </em>141 Conn. 701, 703, 109 A.2d 589 (1954). The decision to set aside a verdict involves the exercise of a broad discretion in the trial court which, in the absence of a clear abuse, will not be disturbed and, in reviewing the exercise of that discretion, every reasonable presumption should be indulged in favor of its correctness. <em>Jacobs </em>v. <em>Goodspeed, </em>180 Conn. 415, 429 A.2d 915 (1980). In applying that standard of review to the facts at hand, we cannot find that the action of the court in setting aside the verdict as excessive constituted a clear abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>Lastly, the plaintiff challenges the trial court\u2019s action in modifying the prejudgment remedy by reducing it from $300,000 to $35,000. Extended discussion of this claim is not necessary. Since proof of probable cause as a condition of obtaining a prejudgment remedy is not as demanding as proof by a fair preponderance of the evidence; see <em>Ledgebrook Condominium Assn., Inc. </em>v. <em>Lush Corporation, </em>172 Conn. 577, 584, 376 A.2d 60 (1977); the trial court\u2019s conclusion that there was not probable cause to sustain a prejudgment attachment in excess of $35,000 cannot be upheld.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-5\">On the cross appeal the defendant requests this court to address itself to an evidentiary ruling concerning the plaintiff\u2019s income from legal fees. The ruling involved the exclusion of the following question directed at the plaintiff: \u201cFrom all sources, how much money did you earn and receive from the legal practice for the year 1971?\u201d The trial court, while conceding that the plaintiff\u2019s standing at the bar was relevant, upon objection, ruled the question inadmissible based upon relevancy grounds. The trial court indicated that its exclusion was based upon the policy enunciated in <em>Booth, Lipton &amp; Lipton </em>v. <em>Cassel, </em>51 Misc. 2d 853, 274 N.Y.S.2d 90 (1966), aff\u2019d, 27 App. Div. 2d 706, 278 N.Y.S.2d 178 (1967). That case held (p. 855) that \u201c[a]n attorney\u2019s success in garnering large fees is not a true indication of his reputation or ability, generally, or in the specific area of practice concerned. This court need not close its eyes to the fact that some of the most able lawyers, of high repute, may be unable to demonstrate their collection of large fees, due solely to their type of practice. Many elements, not related to individual skills and talents, frequently enter into the earnings of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>the lawyer.\u201d See 1 Speiser, Attorneys\u2019 Fees \u00a7 8.8. Doubtless there are dedicated attorneys who have great standing in the legal community but have limited incomes because they choose to practice public service law such as legal aid attorneys, state\u2019s attorneys, public defenders, consumer advocates and others in such fields which unfortunately do not command great remuneration. We are of the opinion, however, that total income from legal services is one factor out of many which is relevant to show an attorney\u2019s reputation. Accordingly, it was error to restrict cross-examination in this area.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-5\">The defendant contends that the trial court erred in charging the jury that it may consider the testimony of Attorney William Moller, who testified that the plaintiff\u2019s services were worth $750,000. The defendant argues that Moller expressly predicated his opinion solely on a contingent fee arrangement. A reading of the transcript shows that this was only one factor which Moller took into account, and that he based his opinion on all the factors outlined in the Code of Professional Responsibility. The jury properly considered his testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-6\">Lastly, the defendant contends that the trial court erred in failing to direct a verdict for the defendant because there was a variance between the judgment and the pleadings and proof. This claim is without merit. A fair reading of paragraph one of the complaint alleges a cause of action based upon quantum meruit.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We reject a formalistic, highly technical <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>view of pleading requirements. \u201cUnder modern rules of pleading, slight linguistic ambiguity should not be fatal to a cause of action.\u201d <em>Schenck </em>v. <em>Pelkey, </em>176 Conn. 245, 255, 405 A.2d 665 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b225-5\">In sum, while it is true that the trial court did not err in setting aside the jury award on the ground that it was excessive and was the product of mistake, it is also true that the jury\u2019s finding as to the defendant\u2019s liability for legal services rendered by the plaintiff remains undisturbed.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-6\">There is error in part, the judgment is affirmed except as to the modification of the prejudgment attachment, and the ease is remanded for a new trial limited to the issue of damages only.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-7\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b220-6\">\u201c[Code of Professional Responsibility] DR 2-106 pees poe legal sebvices.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-7\">(A) A lawyer shall not enter into an agreement for, eharge, or collect an illegal or clearly excessive fee.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-8\">(B) A fee is clearly excessive when, after a review of the facts, a lawyer of ordinary prudence would be left with a definite and firm conviction that the fee is in excess of a reasonable fee.
