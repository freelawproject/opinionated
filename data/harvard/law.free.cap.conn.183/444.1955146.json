The defendant challenges his conviction of third degree burglary by mounting a twofold attack on the court\u2019s instruction: He contends that the instruction violated his fifth amendment right to remain silent<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and that it ran afoul of the mandate of General Statutes \u00a7 54-84 (b).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We reject both arguments and affirm the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>At the outset, we note that the defendant\u2019s claims are reviewable notwithstanding his failure to submit a request to charge or to except to the charge as given. See Practice Book \u00a7 854. The fifth amendment claim is reviewable because it amounts to a claim that the defendant was deprived of a fundamental constitutional right and a fair trial and the record is sufficiently complete for us to consider the claim on the merits. <em>State </em>v. <em>Evans, </em>165 Conn. 61, 70-71, 327 A.2d 576 (1973). The \u00a754-84 (b) claim is reviewable for the reasons stated in <em>State </em>v. <em>Burke, </em>182 Conn. 330, 331-33, 438 A.2d 93 (1980). See <em>State </em>v. <em>Carter, </em>182 Conn. 580, 581, 438 A.2d 778 (1980). Both claims must be considered in light of the charge as a whole. <em>State </em>v. <em>McDaniel, </em>176 Conn. 131, 136, 405 A.2d 68 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b460-6\">The defects in the instruction<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> which the defendant relies on were the court\u2019s use of the word \u201cmay\u201d and its insertion of the word \u201cmerely\u201d before the words \u201cbecause of his failure or refusal to testify.\u201d The defendant claims that these words offend both the fifth amendment and \u00a754-84 (b). We cannot agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>With respect to the fifth amendment claim, the defendant has a right, upon proper request, to have the court instruct the jury that no adverse inferences may be drawn from his failure to testify. <em>Carter </em>v. <em>Kentucky, </em>450 U.S. 288, 305, 101 S. Ct. 1112, 67 L. Ed. 2d 241 (1981). From the record and briefs, it appears that no such request was made in this case. Moreover, we conclude that the contested instruction discharged the trial court\u2019s \u201cconstitutional obligation ... to minimize the danger that the jury [would] give evidentiary weight to a defendant\u2019s failure to testify.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-6\">We next consider the \u00a7 54-84 (b) claim. As to the word \u201cmay,\u201d the statute provides that \u201cthe court shall instruct the jury that they <em>may </em>draw no unfavorable inferences from the accused\u2019s failure to testify.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Thus the charge given satisfied the statute in this respect.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-7\">The defendant also maintains that by the court\u2019s use of the word \u201cmerely,\u201d the instruction left open the possibility that the jury would draw adverse inferences from the accused\u2019s failure to testify. The defendant interprets the instruction as precluding adverse inferences based on his silence alone, but allowing such inferences if the jury found some evidence of guilt. Although we discourage the use of the word \u201cmerely\u201d in this situation because it adds nothing of substance to the charge, we conclude that the defendant has viewed the instruction in a far too technical manner. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Tropiano, </em>158 Conn. 412, 432-33, 262 A.2d 147 (1969), cert. denied, 398 U.S. 949, 90 S. Ct. 1866, 26 L. Ed. 2d 288 (1970). We think a reasonable juror hearing this instruction within the context of the entire charge would naturally assume that the defendant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>silence formed no part of the case. This is in harmony with both the letter and the spirit of \u00a7 54-84 (b).</p>\n<p id=\"b462-4\">There is no error..</p>\n<p id=\"b462-5\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b459-9\"> \u201c[General Statutes] Sec. 53a-103. burglary in the third degree: class d felony, (a) A person is guilty of burglary in the third degree when he enters or remains unlawfully in a building with intent to commit a crime therein.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b459-12\"> The fifth amendment to the United States constitution provides in part that \u201c[n]o person . . . shall be compelled in any criminal ease to be a witness against himself . . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b459-13\"> General Statutes \u00a754-84 (b) provides: \u201cUnless the accused requests otherwise, the court shall instruct the jury that they may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>draw no unfavorable inferences from the accused\u2019s failure to testify. In cases tried to the court, no unfavorable inferences shall be drawn by the court from the accused\u2019s silence.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b460-10\"> The full instruction on the defendant\u2019s failure to testify was as follows: \u201cI\u2019m going to give you another instruction dealing with the credibility of a witness. Now, as I am sure you know, under our law in a criminal case the person on trial for any offense which he might be charged with has the option of testifying or not to testify in his own behalf. In this ease the defendant elected not to testify. It is my duty to tell you that you may not draw any unfavorable inference as to his guilt merely because of his failure or refusal to testify. In other words, the defendant has no duty to prove his own innocence. The burden is still upon the State to offer evidence sufficient to establish beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant committed the crime or crimes with which he is charged.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
