The defendant David Cook was arrested pursuant to an arrest warrant charging him with violation of probation.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The arrest warrant was issued after a judge of the Superior Court had conducted a review of the affidavit filed in support of the arrest warrant application and had made a finding of probable cause. The finding of probable cause and the warrant thereafter were signed by an assistant clerk of the Superior Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-12\">The issue to be decided is whether the language of Practice Book \u00a7 594 creates a mandatory procedure that must be followed to initiate proceedings for revocation of probation. See Practice Book \u00a7 943.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b535-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>Practice Book \u00a7 594 requires that the \u201cwarrant <em>shall </em>he signed by the judicial authority . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b535-6\">The state concedes that there is no question hut that \u00a7 594 requires that warrants he signed hy the \u201cjudicial authority\u201d and that a clerk or assistant clerk does not constitute the judicial authority. The state urges and the court agrees that the issue is whether the court is mandated to dismiss, whenever such a judicial signature is either purposely or unintentionally omitted, \u201cany warrant not in total compliance with \u00a7 594.\u201d In short, is the word \u201cshall\u201d in \u00a7 594 absolute and mandatory or is it merely directory?</p>\n<p id=\"b535-7\">At the outset it must he recognized that the issue involves a Practice Book rule promulgated hy the judges of the Superior Court, and not a statute. The rules of statutory construction, however, are clearly applicable. The Appellate Session of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>Superior Court has confirmed the logic of this approach. <em>State </em>v. <em>Neal, </em>Superior Court, Appellate Session, <em>No. </em>848 (June 12, 1980); State v. <em>Argiros, </em>Superior Court, Appellate Session, Nos. 730, 731 (March 26,1979). In each case the court interpreted \u201cshall\u201d in Connecticut Practice Book sections as mandatory, and in so holding applied the accepted rules of statutory construction.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-6\">It has long been recognized that penal statutes and rules of criminal procedure are to be strictly construed to protect the fundamental constitutional right to liberty. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Tedesco, </em>175 Conn. 279, 291, 397 A.2d 1352 (1978); <em>State </em>v. <em>Moore, </em>158 Conn. 461, 465, 262 A.2d 166 (1969); <em>Perry </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>37 Conn. 32, 35 (1870). To conclude that the rule of strict construction did not apply to \u00a7 594 would ignore the established law of this state.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-7\">Words and phrases are to be given their ordinary meaning in construing statutes unless the text indicates otherwise. General Statutes \u00a7 1-1. Unless the text indicates otherwise, the word \u201cshall\u201d must be assumed to have been used with full awareness of its ordinary meaning. <em>Graham </em>v. <em>Zimmerman, </em>181 Conn. 367, 371, 435 A.2d 996 (1980). An examination of the text of \u00a7 594 clearly indicates nothing which can support the intent to use the word in a context other than its ordinary meaning.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-8\">Every portion of a statute is presumed to have a separate and independent meaning. <em>State </em>v. <em>Grant, </em>176 Conn. 17, 20, 404 A.2d 873 (1978); <em>Engle </em>v. <em>Personnel Appeal Board, </em>175 Conn. 127, 129-30, 394 A.2d 731 (1978). The state\u2019s contention is that the essence of \u00a7 594 is a finding of probable cause and, this being so, the term \u201cshall\u201d is merely <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>directory. This court does not agree. The language of \u00a7 594 is very clear; it mandates that the warrant shall be signed by the judicial authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-5\">This court agrees with the trial court\u2019s conclusion that \u00a7 594 is designed to provide protection of an individual\u2019s liberty and security interest as supported by logic and precedent. The presence of the judge\u2019s signature lends an authenticity to the warrant which is self-evident due to its presence. An assurance of accuracy and deliberation attaches to a document bearing the official\u2019s or judge\u2019s signature, and, not the least important, it involves a document which ultimately reaches the individual\u2019s fundamental constitutional right.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-6\">The warrant lacked the judge\u2019s personal signature and therefore failed to comply with Practice Book \u00a7 594 and therefore could not initiate proceedings for revocation of probation. Practice Book \u00a7 943. The granting of the motion to dismiss was proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-7\">There is no error.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b534-13\"> The arrest warrant was issued July 1, 1979, during the period of the defendant's probation but was not served on him until November 2, 1979, some three months after probation had terminated.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b534-14\"> Prior to October 1, <em>1980, </em>Practice Book 5 943 provided in pertinent part: \u201cAll proceedings for revocation of probation shall be initiated by an arrest warrant supported by an affidavit or by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>testimony under oath showing probable cause to believe that the defendant has violated any of the conditions of his probation</p>\n<p id=\"AmkY\">Practice Book \u00a7 943 now provides: \u201cIn eases where the revocation of probation is based upon a conviction for a new offense and the defendant is before the court or is being held in custody pursuant to that conviction, the revocation proceeding may be initiated by a motion to the court by a probation officer and a copy thereof shall be delivered personally to the defendant.
