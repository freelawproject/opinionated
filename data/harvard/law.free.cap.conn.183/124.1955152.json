In making that order, however, the court failed to file a memorandum of decision or state on the record any basis for its order. The failure to do so effectively prevents appellate review of the defendant\u2019s claim of an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-5\">It is the duty of the judge who tried the case to set forth the basis of his decision. <em>Johnson Electrical Co. </em>v. <em>State, </em>164 Conn. 346, 348, 321 A.2d 461 (1973). This basis is usually set forth in a memorandum of decision. Practice Book \u00a7 3060B. Section 3060D of the Practice Book provides that \u201c[i]f the supreme court deems it necessary to the proper disposition of the cause, it may remand the case for a further articulation of the basis of the trial court\u2019s decision.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b139-6\">The case is remanded with direction to deliver the file to the judge who presided at the trial with direction for an articulation of the basis of his decision.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
