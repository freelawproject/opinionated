The mother has consented to the termination of her parental rights with respect to said child. General Statutes \u00a717-43a (a) (5). After a court hearing, the trial court found that the father had (1) abandoned his infant son and (2) lacked an ongoing parent-child relationship. General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 17-43a (a) (1), 17-43a (a) (4). As a result of these findings, the trial court terminated the parental rights of the father, from which decision the father appeals. Our holding on the issue of abandonment is dispositive of this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>\u201cThe termination of parental rights is defined as \u2018the complete severance by court order of the legal relationship, with all its rights and responsibilities, between the child and his parent . . . .\u2019 General Statutes \u00a745-61b (g). It is \u2018a most serious and sensitive judicial action.\u2019 <em>Anonymous </em>v. <em>Norton, </em>168 Conn. 421, 430, 362 A.2d 532, cert. denied, 423 U.S. 935, 96 S. Ct. 294, 46 L. Ed. 2d 268 (1975). \u2018Although that ultimate interference by the state in the parent-child relationship may be required under certain circumstances, the natural rights of parents in their children \u201cundeniably warrants deference and, absent a powerful countervailing interest, protection.\u201d <em>Stanley </em>v. <em>Illinois, </em>405 U.S. 645, 651, 92 S. Ct. 1208, 31 L. Ed. 2d 551 [1972]; see <em>In re Appeal of Kindis, </em>162 Conn. 239, 240, 294 A.2d 316 [1972]; <em>Cinque </em>v. <em>Boyd, </em>[99 Conn. 70, 82, 121 A. 678 (1923)].\u2019 <em>Anonymous </em>v. <em>Norton, </em>supra, 425. See <em>Alsager </em>v. <em>District Court of Polk County, Iowa, </em>406 F. Sup. 10, 22-24 (S.D. Iowa 1975), affirmed, 545 F.2d 1137 (8th Cir. 1976).\u201d <em>In re Juvenile Appeal (Anonymous), </em>177 Conn. 648, 671, 420 A.2d 875 (1979); <em>In re Juvenile Appeal (Anonymous), </em>181 Conn. 638, 640, 436 A.2d 290 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b27-4\">The commissioner of children and youth services in petitioning to terminate parental rights in the absence of consent must allege and prove abandonment as set forth in \u00a7 17-43a. The statutory criteria must be strictly complied with before termination can be accomplished. <em>In re Juvenile Appeal (Anonymous), </em>supra, 644-45.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-5\">In its memorandum of decision, the trial court stated its decision on the legal and factual issues in the case and the factual basis for its decision. Practice Book \u00a7 3060B. The following facts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>were found: The mother is not married to the father. The father never offered to assist for prenatal care, medical or hospital expenses or to help the mother establish a home for the child after his birth. On a number of occasions, the father refused to acknowledge paternity of the child. It was not until August 3, 1977, when the child was twenty months old and only after he had been assured that he would not be held liable for preacknowledgment expenses, that he acknowledged paternity. The father failed to contribute to the support of the child even though the child was cold, sick and in need of adequate lodging. For a long period of time, the father failed to visit the child or display any love and affection for him. There was no personal interaction between the father and the child. The father did not concern himself with the child\u2019s welfare. On one occasion, the father forcibly removed the child to the home of the father\u2019s mother. Repossession of the child by the child\u2019s mother was obtained with the aid of the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-5\">Our General Statutes have clarified the meaning and definition of abandonment. Section 17-43a (a) (1) reads: \u201cThe parents have abandoned the child in the sense that they have failed to maintain a reasonable degree of interest, concern or responsibility as to the child\u2019s wefare.\u201d Abandonment focuses on the parent\u2019s conduct. It is a question of fact for the trial court \u201cwhich has the parties before it and is in the best position to analyze all of the factors which go into the ultimate conclusion that [the statutory standard of abandonment] has been satisfied.\u201d <em>In re Adoption of Webb, </em>14 Wash. App. 651, 657, 544 P.2d 130 (1975). From a recital of the facts above and the father\u2019s course of conduct, it is apparent that the father manifested no reasonable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>degree of interest, concern or responsibility whatsoever as to the child\u2019s welfare and the trial court so found.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-5\">In <em>In re Adoption of Webb, </em>supra, the court found that the father had abandoned the child \u201cunder circumstances showing a wilful substantial lack of regard for parental obligations.\u201d Wash. Bev. Code \u00a7 26.32.040 (4). The court stated as follows: \u201cThe commonly understood general obligations of parenthood entail these minimum attributes: (1) express love and affection for the child; (2) express personal concern over the health, education and general well-being of the child; (3) the duty to supply the necessary food, clothing,\u2019 and medical care; (4) the duty to provide an adequate domicile; and (5) the duty to furnish social and religious guidance.\u201d <em>In re Adoption of Webb, </em>supra, 653. In this case, we are of the opinion that the father has failed to meet the first four minimum parental obligations.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-6\">We conclude that the findings of subordinate facts amply support the conclusion reached on the issue of abandonment and that no erroneous rule of law was applied by the trial court. The trial court did not err in concluding that the father had abandoned his child as the word abandonment is defined in \u00a7 17-43a (a) (1) of the General Statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-7\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-8\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
