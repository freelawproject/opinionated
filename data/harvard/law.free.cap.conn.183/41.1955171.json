J.</author>\n<p id=\"A7q\">The defendant appeals from the trial court\u2019s imposition of a constructive trust in favor of Walenty and Catherine Starzee\u2019s children, the stepchildren of the defendant\u2019s decedent, Clara Starzee. The plaintiffs are the four children of Walenty and Catherine.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-7\">Walenty Starzee and his first wife Catherine purchased a three-family dwelling at 225 Stanley Street, New Britain, as joint owners with rights of sur-vivorship. Upon Catherine\u2019s death Walenty became the sole owner of the real estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-8\">On November 12,1949, Walenty married a widow, Clara Sliwa Moskal, the defendant\u2019s decedent. They resided at 225 Stanley Street during the eleven years of their very happy, close, loving marriage. However, they kept their property separate.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-9\">On Friday, February 17, 1961, Walenty knew he was dying of cancer. He telephoned his eldest daughter, Mary, and asked her to come to his home and witness what he and Clara were going to do with the house. On the same day, Mary came to Walenty\u2019s house, and witnessed an oral agreement between Walenty and Clara, in which Clara promised to leave Walenty\u2019s home to his children upon her death. Chester Sledzik, an attorney, then arrived to prepare Walenty\u2019s will. After the attorney left, Clara repeated her promise in the presence of Walenty and Mary.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-10\">At trial, Sledzik testified that Walenty told him that he was sick, old and could not come to the lawyer\u2019s office, but that he wanted the will executed as quickly as possible because \u201che was going to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>dead on Monday.\u201d On the following day, when the lawyer returned, Walenty executed a will which on its face gave all his real property outright to Clara without limitation, and which named Clara executrix and the plaintiffs his residuary beneficiaries. At the same time, Clara executed a separate will, in which she bequeathed her entire estate to Walenty. Walenty died on Monday, as he had predicted. Clara held title to the real estate upon Walenty\u2019s death.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-6\">Clara executed a new will on March 25,1965. The plaintiffs only learned about this will after she died on October 3, 1973. It gave twenty-seven small bequests of cash to various individuals, including two of the plaintiffs. A residuary clause gave the remainder of Clara\u2019s estate including her interest in 225 Stanley Street to her niece and executrix, the defendant. On February 22,1974, the plaintiffs presented the defendant with their claim against Clara\u2019s estate for the real property at 225 Stanley Street. When the defendant disallowed the claim, the plaintiffs petitioned the Superior Court for a judgment declaring them to be the lawful owners of the real estate. Following a trial, the court found: that a confidential relationship permeated the agreement between Clara and Walenty to leave 225 Stanley Street to his children; that Clara abused this confidential relationship by failing to abide by her promise; and that allowing the defendant to retain the property would result in unjust enrichment. The court imposed a constructive trust and rendered judgment for the plaintiffs.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b58-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>Equity employs the constructive trust to remedy the unjust enrichment which results when a testator leaves property to a person in reliance on that person\u2019s subsequently disregarded promise to convey the property to the testator\u2019s intended beneficiary. <em>Redke </em>v. <em>Silvertrust, </em>6 Cal. 3d 94, 490 P.2d 805 (1971), cert. denied, 405 U.S. 1041, 92 S.

See comment, 27 Yale L.J. 389 (1918).</p>\n<p id=\"b58-6\">Sound policy seeks to safeguard titles to land and frustrate fraudulent claims against the estates <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>of deceased persons.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Therefore, before a conrt imposes a constructive trust upon real property on the ground that one deceased failed to fulfill a promise to another, the facts from which such trust may be implied should he clearly and satisfactorily established. Cf. <em>Wilson </em>v. <em>Warner, </em>84 Conn. 560, 564-65, 80 A. 718 (1911).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b59-6\">The defendant does not seriously dispute that a confidential relationship existed between Walenty and Clara. Moreover, she admits that Clara abused the confidential relationship if Clara promised Walenty that she would leave the property to his children.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-7\">The defendant argues that Clara\u2019s declarations<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> taken by themselves are unclear, meaningless, or at best ambiguous, that the trial court erred in admit<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>ting certain declarations of Walenty, and that without the disputed declarations there is insufficient evidence to support the trial court\u2019s determination that Clara agreed to leave 225 Stanley Street to Walenty\u2019s children and hence that the court erred in imposing a constructive trust.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-6\">The defendant\u2019s argument underestimates the weight of Clara\u2019s declarations. Its suggestion that Clara\u2019s declarations should be \u201ctaken by themselves\u201d ignores the general principle \u201cthat the whole of a verbal utterance must be taken together.\u201d (Italics omitted.) 7 Wigmore, Evidence (Chadbourn Rev. 1978) \u00a7 2094, p. 604. Although no generally accepted formula defines the boundary between separate utterances and \u201cthe whole of an utterance\u201d; 7 Wigmore, op. cit. \u00a7 2119, p. 670; a question and its response; <em>Engle </em>v. <em>Conti, </em>78 Conn. 351, 353, 62 A. 210 (1905); <em>Barnum </em>v. <em>Barnum, </em>9 Conn. 241, 248 (1832); <em>Phelps </em>v. <em>Foot, </em>1 Conn. 387, 391 (1815); and other forms of dialogue; <em>State </em>v. <em>Tropiano, </em>158 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>Conn. 412, 420, 262 A.2d 147 (1969), cert. denied, 398 U.S. 949, 90 S. Ct. 1866, 26 L. Ed. 2d 288 (1970); <em>Gray </em>v. <em>Greenblatt, </em>113 Conn. 535, 538-39, 155 A. 707 (1931); may form one statement.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> To the extent an admissible answer incorporates the question to which it responds or depends on the question for its meaning, it makes the question admissible. <em>Engle </em>v. <em>Conti, </em>supra.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b61-6\">In the dialogue leading to Clara\u2019s promise, Walenty incorporated his statement, \u201cI decided to give the property at 225 Stanley Street, for life use to Clara, as long as she lives and then she promises me to give it back to the children,\u201d into his question, \u201cIs that right, Clara, you promised?\u201d Clara\u2019s answer, \u201cWalenty, on my honor before God, your children will have it after I\u2019m gone,\u201d becomes intelligible in the light of Walenty\u2019s question. Hence, the trial court properly admitted Walenty\u2019s part of this dialogue. <em>Engle </em>v. <em>Conti, </em>supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-7\">This colloquy also illuminates the conversation after the lawyer left, in which Walenty stated, \u201cWell, Clara, I did what I was supposed to do and now it\u2019s up to you to make sure that you do what <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>you\u2019re supposed to do as you promised me.\u201d To this statement Clara replied, \u201cEverything will be all right, Walenty. Don\u2019t worry.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b62-6\">The court based its conclusion that Clara orally agreed to leave 225 Stanley Street to the plaintiffs not merely on these and other declarations, which Clara made in Walenty\u2019s presence on February 17, 1961, but also upon the history of her marriage to Walenty, the love and close relationship between Walenty and his children, his awareness of the imminence of his death, and Clara\u2019s execution of a will on the next day leaving all her property to Walenty. In this appeal, the defendants do not challenge the admission of any of this additional evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-7\">In reaching its conclusion, the trial court also relied on the fact that throughout their marriage Clara and Walenty maintained their financial holdings separately. Attorney Chester Sledzik\u2019s and Mary Starzec\u2019s unchallenged testimony supports the inference that Walenty was the sole owner of 225 Stanley Street until he died. Agnes Hogan, another of Walenty\u2019s daughters, also testified that, during his marriage to Clara, Walenty stated that 225 Stanley Street was in his name and that he wanted it to stay that way because he wanted that property for his children.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Furthermore, Mary Starzee testified, without objection, that Clara had no survivorship interest in Walenty\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>bank accounts and that Clara received mortgage payments from two homes in Hartford that she had sold. This testimony by three witnesses amply supports the trial court\u2019s subsidiary determination that both Walenty and Clara segregated their property from the other\u2019s.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-6\">Clearly admissible testimony proved by clear and satisfactory evidence, in accordance with the standard in <em>Wilson </em>v. <em>Warner, </em>supra, that Clara promised to leave 225 Stanley Street to Walenty\u2019s children upon her death. Hence, we decline to decide whether the trial court erred in relying on General Statutes \u00a7 52-172 to overrule hearsay objections to other declarations of Walenty which tended to prove that he and Clara kept their property separate, because the defendant has failed, on appeal, to demonstrate probable harm to her from any of those rulings. <em>Berndston </em>v. <em>Annino, </em>177 Conn. 41, 45, 411 A.2d 36 (1979); <em>Wood </em>v. <em>Connecticut Savings Bank, </em>87 Conn. 341, 349, 87 A. 983 (1913).</p>\n<p id=\"b63-7\">Courts may use the equitable device of a constructive trust to remedy the unjust enrichment which results from not disposing of property as promised after the promise induced someone with whom the promissor shared a confidential relationship to transfer the property to the promissor. <em>Cohen </em>v. <em>Cohen, </em>182 Conn. 193, 203, 438 A.2d 55 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b63-8\">The plaintiffs clearly and satisfactorily established that Clara made her explicit promise in the context of Walenty\u2019s full confidence and trust in her, her implicit reassurances of faithfulness, and his knowledge of his terminal illness, the day before he executed his will, and three days before he died. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>Hence, the promise involved a confidential relationship. <em>Hieble </em>v. <em>Hieble, </em>164 Conn. 56, 61, 316 A.2d 777 (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b64-6\">In this context, Clara\u2019s promise and her confidential relationship with Walenty permitted the trial court to infer that Walenty would not have devised 225 Stanley Street to Clara had he not relied on her promise to convey it to his children upon her death. The defendant failed to negate this inference. <em>Hieble </em>v. <em>Hieble, </em>supra, 62.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-7\">Because Clara acquired property from Walenty with whom she shared a confidential relationship, by promising him that she would leave the property to his children and she failed to fulfill her promise, a constructive trust would compel her, if she were alive, to convey the property, to the person to whom it justly belongs.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <em>Cohen </em>v. <em>Cohen, </em>supra; <em>Hieble </em>v. <em>Hieble, </em>supra, 59; <em>Worobey </em>v. <em>Sibieth, </em>136 Conn. 352, 355, 71 A.2d 80 (1949); <em>Beatty </em>v. <em>Guggenheim Exploration Co., </em>225 N.Y. 380, 386, 122 N.E. 378 (1919); Restatement, Restitution \u00a7 160; Restate<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>ment (Second), Trust \u00a744 (comment a); Bogert, Trusts &amp; Trustees (2d Ed. 1960) \u00a7471; 5 Scott, Trusts (3d Ed. 1967) \u00a7 462.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-4\">Because Clara\u2019s failure to keep her promise to Walenty unjustly enriched her estate, the court did not err in imposing a constructive trust to compel her executor to convey the property to the plaintiffs. Re<em>dke </em>v. <em>Silvertrust, </em>supra; <em>Fisk\u2019s Appeal, </em>81 Conn. 433, 438, 71 A. 559 (1908); <em>Foreman </em>v. <em>Foreman, </em>251 N.Y. 237, 167 N.E. 428 (1929); <em>Olsen </em>v. <em>First National Bank, </em>supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-5\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-6\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b57-7\"> The trial court, citing <em>Hieble </em>v. <em>Hieble, </em>164 Conn. 56, 62, 316 A.2d <em>777 </em>(1972), stated that once a confidential relationship has been established, substantial authority holds that the party opposing a constructive trust has the burden of negating the constructive trust by clear and convincing evidence. The defendant does not object to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>this statement. It is clear, however, that the trial court did not relieve the plaintiffs of their burden of proving the existence of a promise or agreement to leave 225 Stanley Street to Walenty\u2019s children upon Clara\u2019s death. <em>Taylor </em>v. <em>Bunnell, </em>211 Cal. 601, 296 P. 288 (1931); <em>Sylvester </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>296 Mich. 571, 296 N.W. 682 (1941); <em>Boatman </em>v. <em>Berg, </em>176 Mont. 208, 577 P.2d 382 (1978); <em>Saunders </em>v. <em>Visser, </em>20 Wash. 2d 58, 145 P.2d 898 (1944); 89 C.J.S., Trusts \u00a7 155, p. 1077.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-8\">Courts consider two distinct relationships \u201cconfidential\u201d in the context of constructive trusts. In the first, one party is under the domination of another. In the second, circumstances justify a party\u2019s belief that his or her welfare or instructions will guide the other\u2019s actions. See <em>Wimmer </em>v. <em>Wimmer, </em>287 Md. 663, 668-69, 414 A.2d 1254 (1980). In relationships where one party is a legal fiduciary; <em>McFail </em>v. <em>Braden, </em>19 Ill. 2d 108, 166 N.E.2d 46 (1960); or completely dominates the other; <em>Francois </em>v. <em>Francois, </em>599 F.2d 1286 (3d Cir. 1979), cert. denied, 444 U.S. 1021, 100 S. Ct. 679, 62 L. Ed. 2d 653 (1980); any transfer between them may impose upon the fiduciary or dominant party the burden of proving that the transfer did not abuse the relationship. But where the surviving spouse is a natural object of the testator\u2019s bounty and the confidential relationship rests exclusively upon (1) the natural inclination to repose great confidence and trust in a spouse, (2) the spouse\u2019s implicit reassurances of faithfulness, and (3) the testator\u2019s knowledge of his terminal illness; <em>Hieble </em>v. <em>Hieble, </em>supra, 61; the surviving spouse does not have the burden of justifying every benefit received under the deceased spouse\u2019s will.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b59-8\"> The statute of frauds and the statute of wills seek to effectuate the policies of safeguarding titles and frustrating fraudulent claims. Those statutes, however, do not apply to constructive trusts, which are implied by operation of law. <em>Cohen </em>v. <em>Cohen, </em>182 Conn. 193, 202, 438 A.2d 55 (1980); <em>Fisk\u2019s Appeal, </em>81 Conn. 433, 437-39, 71 A. 559 (1908).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b59-9\"> There is substantial authority which requires clear and convincing evidence of facts needed to establish any constructive trust. See <em>National Waste Co. </em>v. <em>Spring Packing Corporation, </em>200 F.2d 14, 16 (7th Cir. 1952), cert. denied, 345 U.S. 909, 73 S. Ct. 649, 97 L.
