Benston, Jr., appeals the district court\u2019s order substituting the United States of America in place of Donald L. Evans, Secretary of the United States Department of Commerce, and dismissing his civil action for lack of jurisdiction. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-19\">Benston\u2019s claim is controlled by the Federal Tort Claims Act (\u201cFTCA\u201d) 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2671-2680 (2000), which provides the exclusive remedy for torts committed by a government employee in the scope of his employment. <em>See United States v. Smith, </em>499 U.S. 160, 165-66, 111 S.Ct. 1180, 113 L.Ed.2d 134 (1991). We find the United States was appropriately substituted in the place of Donald L. Evans because federal employees who are sued for actions within the scope of their office or employment are immunized, and the United States is substituted in their place. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2679 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b296-20\">Turning to the dismissal of Benston\u2019s complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, we find Benston\u2019s complaint was properly dismissed because he failed to exhaust administrative remedies as required before bringing a FTCA action. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2675(a) (2000). Moreover, even if Benston had properly exhausted his administrative remedies, the district court lacked jurisdiction because the FTCA specifically excludes the tort of false imprisonment from claims for which the United States has waived sovereign immunity. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2680(h) (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b296-21\">Accordingly, we affirm the order of the district court. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-22\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
