Finding no error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-5\">Wallace first contends on appeal that the district court erred in its application of the Armed Career Criminal Act (\u201cACCA\u201d) because the court considered convictions that were neither admitted to nor found by a jury beyond a reasonable doubt. When reviewing a district court\u2019s application of the sentencing guidelines, we review legal determinations de novo. <em>United States v. Blake, </em>81 F.3d 498, 503 (4th Cir.1996). A district court may enhance a sentence based on the \u201cfact of a prior conviction\u201d regardless of whether or not it was admitted to by the defendant or found by a jury. <em>United States v. Thompson, </em>421 F.3d 278, 282 (4th Cir.2005). Therefore, a district court may determine if a defendant has been convicted of the predicate offenses required by the ACCA so long as the facts necessary to support the enhancement \u201cinhere in the fact of conviction\u201d rather than being \u201cextraneous to it.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 283.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-6\">We have previously determined that the statutes underlying Wallace\u2019s convictions constitute \u201cviolent felonies\u201d for ACCA purposes. <em>See Thompson, </em>421 F.3d at 284-85; <em>United States v. Pierce, </em>278 F.3d 282, 289 (4th Cir.2002); <em>United States v. Bowden, </em>975 F.2d 1080, 1081-1085 (4th Cir.1992). Furthermore, the offenses occurred on different dates, in different geographical locations, and involved different criminal objectives and victims. <em>See Thompson, </em>421 F.3d at 284-86; <em>United States v. Williams, </em>187 F.3d 429, 431 (4th Cir.1999). Therefore, we conclude the district court properly enhanced Wallace\u2019s sentence under the ACCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-7\">Wallace also contends that his sentence was unreasonable. After the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), a sentencing court is no longer bound by the range prescribed by the sentencing guidelines. <em>See United States v. Hughes, </em>401 F.3d 540, 546 (4th Cir.2005). However, in determining a sentence <em>post-Booker, </em>sentencing courts are still required to calculate and consider the guideline range prescribed thereby as well as the factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) (2000). <em>Id. </em>If the sentence imposed is within the properly calculated guideline range, it is presumptively reasonable. <em>United States v. Green, </em>436 F.3d 449 (4th Cir.2006). Because the district court appropriately treated the guidelines as advisory, properly calculated and considered the guideline range, and weighed the relevant \u00a7 3553(a) factors, we find Wallace\u2019s sentence reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-9\">Accordingly, we affirm Wallace\u2019s sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-10\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
