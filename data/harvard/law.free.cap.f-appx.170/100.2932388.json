Defendant contends that the sentence imposed violated his constitutional and statutory rights under <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We vacate and remand for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-11\">Defendants constitutional claims were raised timely in the district court and, as such, preserved for our review. Defendant argues that his Sixth Amendment rights were violated when the district court determined that (i) the amount of loss exceeded $1,000,000 (qualifying him for a 16-level offense enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B1.1(b)(1)(I));<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> (II) the offense involved 10 or more victims (qualifying him for a 2-level offense enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Bl.1(b)(2)(A)(i); and (iii) the offense involved sophisticated means (qualifying him for a two-level offense enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B1.1(b)(8)(C)).</p>\n<p id=\"b127-15\">We doubt that Defendant suffered a violation of his Sixth Amendment rights. About the first two enhancements (loss amount and number of victims), Defendant contested no facts supporting those enhancements. A defendant\u2019s failure to dispute facts set out in the PSI or recited at the plea colloquy operates as an admission of those facts for <em>Booker </em>purposes. <em>See United States v. Shelton, </em>400 F.3d 1325, 1330 (11th Cir.2005) (concluding that sentence enhancement based on drug quantity not violative of <em>Booker </em>where defendant failed to dispute facts in the PSI)- A sentencing enhancement based on admitted facts has no Sixth Amendment implications under <em>Booker. Id. </em>About the sophisticated-means enhancement, Defendant never contested the facts underlying the enhancement; instead, he argued that application of the sophisticated-means enhancement was improper in the light of the facts of the case. The district court\u2019s conclusion that the offense involved sophisticated means involved the application of law to relevant admitted facts, <em>see United States v. Petho, 409 F.3d </em>1277, 1279-80 n. 1 (11th Cir.2005); no constitutional <em>Booker </em>principle was implicated by the imposition of a sophisticated-means enhancement.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-16\">Although the district court committed no constitutional <em>Booker </em>error, statutory <em>Booker </em>error occurs when the sentencing court misapplies the guidelines by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>considering them as binding \u201ceven in the absence of a Sixth Amendment enhancement violation.\u201d <em>Shelton, </em>400 F.3d at 1330-31. Statutory <em>Booker </em>error requires reversal \u201conly if [the error] resulted in actual prejudice because it had substantial and injurious effect or influence in determining the [result].\u201d <em>United States v. Gallegos-Aguero, </em>409 F.3d 1274, 1277 (11th Cir.2005) <em>(quoting United States v. Guzman, </em>167 F.3d 1350, 1353 (11th Cir.1999)). The government bears the burden to show the absence of effect of the statutory error on the defendant\u2019s substantial rights. <em>United States v. Mathenia, </em>409 F.3d 1289, 1291 (11th Cir.2005). A sentence is due to be affirmed if it can be said \u201c \u2018with fair assurance ... that the [sentence] was not substantially swayed by the error.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. (quoting United States v. Hornaday, </em>392 F.3d 1306, 1315-16 (11th Cir.2004), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 2951, 162 L.Ed.2d 877 (2005)). Although the non-constitutional harmless error standard of review imposes a less demanding burden on the government than the beyond a reasonable doubt burden imposed in cases of constitutional error, <em>see Mathenia, </em>409 F.3d at 1291-92, \u201cthe non-constitutional harmless error standard is not easy for the government to meet.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1292.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-6\">The government concedes <em>Booker </em>statutory error; it argues the error was harmless because the sentence imposed \u2014 72 months \u2014 was two months higher than the bottom of Defendant\u2019s applicable sentencing range of 70 to 87 months, and because the court stated that it believed the sentence \u201cappropriate, given [Defendant\u2019s] role and activities in this case, and it comes close to the bottom of the Guidelines recommended by the parties.\u201d But the district court also commented that Defendant would be resentenced if the \u201cGuidelines go down in flames.\u201d This comment suggests that Defendant could have received a different sentence if the district court fashioned a sentence in a sentencing scheme where the guidelines were advisory.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-8\">The record does not allow us to say with fair assurance that Defendant\u2019s sentence was not substantially impacted on by the statutory <em>Booker </em>error. What sentence the district court would have imposed had it considered the guidelines advisory is impossible to tell. The government can not meet the burden of proving that the district court\u2019s application of the guidelines as mandatory was harmless. Accordingly, we vacate Defendant\u2019s sentence and remand for resentencing consistent with <em>Booker.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b128-9\">VACATED and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b127-12\">. <em>Booker </em>was decided by the Supreme Court after Defendant was sentenced. At sentencing, Defendant raised his constitutional claims based on <em>Blakely </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004). Because the <em>Booker </em>decision applies to all cases on direct review, we apply <em>Booker </em>to this appeal. <em>Booker, </em>125 S.Ct. at 769.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b127-19\">.
