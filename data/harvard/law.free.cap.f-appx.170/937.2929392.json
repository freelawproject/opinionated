Martinez first argues that the district court erred by refusing to give the jury instruction on duress that he had requested.</p>\n<p id=\"b964-19\">Duress is a form of an affirmative defense. <em>United States v. Posada-Rios, </em>158 F.3d 832, 873 (5th Cir.1998). Before the defense may be presented to the jury, a defendant must present evidence of each of the following four elements: (1) that the defendant or a member of his family \u201cwas under an unlawful and present, imminent, and impending threat of such a nature as to induce a well-grounded apprehension of death or serious body injury\u201d; (2) that he \u201chad not recklessly or negligently placed himself in a situation in which it was probable that he would be forced to choose the criminal conduct\u201d; (3) that he \u201chad no reasonable legal alternative to violating the law,\u201d that is, no chance \u201cto refuse to do the criminal act and ... to avoid the threatened harm\u201d; and (4) that there was \u201ca direct causal relationship ... between the criminal action taken and the avoidance of the threatened harm.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks, citation, and brackets omitted); <em>United States v. Liu, </em>960 F.2d 449, 454 (5th Cir.1992) (noting that the defense extends to threats involving family members).</p>\n<p id=\"b965-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"939\">*939</page-number>We review a district court\u2019s refusal to submit a requested instruction on duress for an abuse of discretion. <em>Posada-Rios, </em>158 F.3d at 875. A present, imminent, or impending threat \u201conly arises if there is a real emergency leaving no time to pursue any legal alternative.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 874. It thus requires proof of \u201cabsolute and uncontrollable necessity.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 874 <em>&amp; </em>n. 20. Martinez argues that the district court incorrectly required that he establish the imminent-threat element by a preponderance of the evidence. He argues that \u201c[t]he question was not whether, in the district court\u2019s view, duress had been proved by a preponderance. Rather, the question was whether there was sufficient evidence to let the jury decide whether it had.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b965-5\">The evidentiary foundation required for an instruction on an affirmative defense is whether the evidence presented in support of the instruction is \u201csufficient for a reasonable jury to rule in favor of the defendant on that theory.\u201d <em>United States v. Stone, </em>960 F.2d 426, 432 (5th Cir.1992) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted); <em>see also United States v. Branch, </em>91 F.3d 699, 713 (5th Cir.1996) (addressing the quantum of evidence required to warrant an instruction on self-defense). The jury could not have ruled in favor of Martinez on the issue of duress unless he proved each element of the defense by a preponderance of the evidence. <em>See United States v. Willis, </em>38 F.3d 170, 179 (5th Cir.1994). However, even if we were to accept Martinez\u2019s argument that the court need only find that the evidence was \u201csufficient\u201d to require a duress instruction, Martinez has made no such showing. Martinez failed to set forth objective evidence of an immediate threat to either his safety or the safety of his family. <em>See Posada-Rios, </em>158 F.3d at 873-75. Accordingly, we find that the district court did not abuse its discretion by refusing to give the jury an instruction on duress. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b965-7\">Martinez also argues that the district court abused its discretion by refusing to dismiss Juror # 1 for bias based on the juror\u2019s reporting that he knew Martinez\u2019s employer. Martinez asserts that although he never directly implicated his employer in the drug conspiracy, \u201cthat view could be reasonably inferred from [the] evidence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b965-8\">The Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments guarantee the right to a trial by an impartial jury. <em>United States v. Hinojosa, 958 </em>F.2d 624, 631 (5th Cir.1992). Because a trial judge has the \u201cacknowledged advantage\u201d of observing the demeanor and credibility of jurors, we grant \u201cbroad discretion to the trial judge in making determinations of impartiality and will not interfere with such decisions absent a clear abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b965-9\">Martinez never implicated his employer in the conspiracy. Moreover, the district court personally questioned the juror regarding his impartiality and assessed the credibility of the juror\u2019s responses. The juror\u2019s \u201ccandor on the subject\u201d bolsters his later assertions that he would be impartial. <em>See Hinojosa, </em>958 F.2d at 631. The district court did not abuse its discretion in denying the motion to strike the juror. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b965-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b964-14\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
