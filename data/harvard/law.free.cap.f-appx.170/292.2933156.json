Shull also was charged in an information with the armed robbery of a bank in Tennessee. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2113(d) (2000). The Tennessee case was transferred to the Western District of North Carolina pursuant to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>Fed.R.Crim.P. 20, and the cases were consolidated for sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-5\">With respect to the most serious of the three crimes, the Tennessee robbery, the probation officer assigned a base offense level of 20. <em>See U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 2B3.1(a) (2003). Two levels were added because property of a financial institution was taken. <em>See </em>USSG \u00a7 2B3.1(b)(l). Six levels were added because Shull used a firearm during the robbery. <em>See </em>USSG \u00a7 2B3.1(b)(2)(B). One level was added based on amount of loss. <em>See </em>USSG \u00a7 2B3.1(b)(7)(B). Finally, two levels were added for obstruction of justice because Shull escaped from custody while awaiting sentencing. <em>See </em>USSG \u00a7 3C1.1. His adjusted offense level was 31. The offenses were grouped. <em>See </em>USSG \u00a7 3D1.4. The total number of units was 2, and the offense level was accordingly increased by two, for a total offense level of 33. With a criminal history category of VI, Shull\u2019s guideline range was 235-293 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-6\">Shull raised a Sixth Amendment challenge to the presentence report. In particular, Shull denied using a firearm during the Tennessee robbery and contended that the probation officer had erroneously recommended the corresponding six-level enhancement to his offense level. At sentencing, the district court heard testimony on the issue, made a credibility determination against Shull, and found that the enhancement was correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-7\">The court sentenced Shull to 293 months for the Tennessee robbery and 240 months on each of the North Carolina robberies. The sentences run concurrently. Shull timely appealed, raising only one issue: that his sentence violates the Sixth Amendment under <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b319-11\">After Shull filed his brief, the United States and Shull filed a Joint Motion to Remand for Resentencing. The parties concur that the sentence violates the Sixth Amendment under <em>Booker </em>and ask that the sentence be vacated and the matter remanded for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-12\">\u201cTo establish that a Sixth Amendment error occurred in his sentencing, [Shull] must show that the district court imposed a sentence exceeding the maximum allowed based only on the facts that he admitted.\u201d <em>See United States v. Evans, </em>416 F.3d 298, 300 (4th Cir.2005). Based only on the facts that Shull admitted, his offense level would have been 30. With a criminal history category of VI, his guideline range would have been 168-210 months. Shull\u2019s sentence of 293 months exceeds the maximum authorized by the facts he admitted. This Sixth Amendment error requires resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-13\">We accordingly grant the motion to remand, vacate the sentence, and remand for resentencing. On remand, the district court should first determine the appropriate sentencing range under the guidelines, making all factual findings appropriate for that determination. <em>United States v. Hughes, </em>401 F.3d 540, 546 (4th Cir.2005). The court should consider this sentencing range along with the other factors described in 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3553(a) (West 2000 &amp; Supp.2005), and then impose a sentence. <em>Id. </em>If that sentence falls outside the guideline range, the court should explain its reasons for the departure as required by 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3553(c)(2). <em>Id. </em>The sentence must be \u201cwithin the statutorily prescribed range and ... reasonable.\u201d <em>Hughes, </em>401 F.3d at 546.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b320-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-4\">\n<em>VACATED AND REMANDED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b319-8\"> Just as we noted in <em>Hughes, </em>\"[w]e offer no criticism of the district court judge, who followed the law and procedure in effect at the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>time of sentencing.\u201d <em>Hughes, </em>401 F.3d at 545 n. 4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
