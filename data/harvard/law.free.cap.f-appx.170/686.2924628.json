After review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-11\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b713-12\">In May 2004, United States Coast Guard personnel observed a Colombian fishing vessel, the Estrella del Sur, refuel a small \u201cgo-fast\u201d boat and provide its crew with food in the Pacific Ocean off Costa Rica. Upon detecting the Coast Guard\u2019s presence, both vessels fled, and the Coast Guard personnel observed the crew of the go-fast boat dropping approximately thirty bales of cocaine into the ocean. The Coast Guard recovered one of those bales, which contained 20 kilograms of cocaine. The Coast Guard also pursued the Estrella del Sur and eventually arrested its crew, which included Sanclemente. The Costa Rican authorities took the go-fast boat\u2019s crew into custody. The Coast Guard and the government estimated that the go-fast boat was transporting at least 600 kilograms of cocaine.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-16\">Sanclemente pled guilty to both counts. The presentence investigation report (\u201cPSI\u201d) assessed a base offense level of 38 under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1(c)(1) based on the amount of drugs (600 kilograms of cocaine) that Sanclemente aided and abetted in the possession and conspired to distribute. The PSI recommended a two-level reduction under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1(b)(7), because Sanclemente met the safety-valve criteria set forth in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5C1.2, and a three-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility. Thus, with a total offense level of 33 and a criminal history category of I, the PSI recommended a guidelines range of 135 to 168 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-17\">In his written objection, Sanclemente objected to the base offense level of 38 used in the PSI. Sanclemente argued that he should be held accountable for 5 kilograms rather than 600 kilograms of cocaine because the indictment specifically provided that the amount of cocaine was five kilograms or more and he had not stipulated to an amount in excess of five kilograms.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b713-18\">At sentencing, Sanclemente adopted the argument of one of his co-defendants, Arbelardo Cuero Arbelardo, regarding the calculation of the base offense level based on drug quantity. Arbelardo argued that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"688\">*688</page-number>the PSI improperly relied upon hearsay in Colombian police reports regarding the amount of drugs involved. The government responded that the PSI\u2019s 600 kilogram amount was determined based on the United States Coast Guard\u2019s observation of the \u201cgo-fast\u201d boat discarding between 30 and 40 bales and the 20 kilogram weight of the bale the Coast Guard was able to retrieve from the water. The district court overruled Arboledo\u2019s objection, noting that the 600 kilogram figure was a conservative estimate.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-4\">The district court then adopted the factual statements in the PSI and determined that the guidelines range was 135 to 168 months. After permitting Sanclemente to allocute, the court imposed a 135-month sentence. The district court noted that \u201cafter considering the advisory sentencing guidelines and all of the factors identified in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) 1 through 7,\u201d a sentence at the low end of the guidelines range was \u201csufficient, but not greater than necessary to comply with the statutory purposes of sentencing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b714-5\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b714-6\">On appeal, Sanclemente argues that at sentencing the district court failed to address the sentencing factors in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) and applied the guidelines in a mandatory manner. After the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), a district court is required to take into account the advisory guidelines range and the sentencing factors set forth in \u00a7 3553(a). <em>See Booker, </em>125 S.Ct. at 764-66; <em>United States v. Crawford, </em>407 F.3d 1174, 1178 (11th Cir. 2005); <em>United States v. Williams, </em>435 F.3d 1350 (11th Cir.2006). Although the district court must consider \u00a7 3553(a)\u2019s factors, \u201cnothing in <em>Booker </em>or elsewhere requires the district court to state on the record that it has explicitly considered each of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors or to discuss each of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors.\u201d <em>United States v. Scott, </em>426 F.3d 1324, 1328-29 (11th Cir.2005). Instead, \u201cacknowledgment by the district court that it has considered the defendant\u2019s arguments and the factors in section 3553(a) is sufficient under <em>Booker. </em>\u201d <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 786 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b714-9\">Contrary to Sanclemente\u2019s assertions, the district court explicitly acknowledged that the guidelines were advisory and that a sentence at the low end of the guidelines range was \u201csufficient, but not greater than necessary to comply with the statutory purposes of sentencing.\u201d We cannot conclude on this record that the district court applied the guidelines in a mandatory fashion. In addition, the district court stated that, in imposing the 135-month sentence, it had considered the advisory guidelines range and all the factors identified in \u00a7 3553(a)(1) through (7). Accordingly, the district court satisfied its obligations under <em>Booker. See id.</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b715-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"689\">*689</page-number>Sanclemente also argues that the district court erred in finding that he was accountable for 600 kilograms of cocaine for purposes of determining his base offense level under the Sentencing Guidelines. We review the district court\u2019s application of the Sentencing Guidelines <em>de novo </em>and its findings of fact for clear error. <em>United States v. Grant, </em>397 F.3d 1330, 1332 (11th Cir.2005). After <em>Booker, </em>district courts must still correctly calculate the guidelines range when determining a defendant\u2019s sentence. <em>See Crawford, </em>407 F.3d at 1178 (stating that, after <em>Booker, </em>district courts must consult the guidelines and \u201c[t]his consultation requirement, at a minimum, obliges the district court to calculate <em>correctly </em>the sentencing range prescribed by the Guidelines\u201d). If a district court applies the guidelines as advisory, nothing in <em>Booker </em>prohibits it <em>from </em>making, under a preponderance-of-the-evidence standard, additional factual findings that go beyond a defendant\u2019s admission. <em>See United States v. Chau, </em>426 F.3d 1318, 1323-24 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b715-5\">Here, the district court did not clearly err in finding that the go-fast boat which the Estrella del Sur refueled contained 600 kilograms of cocaine. The Coast Guard observed the crew of the go-fast boat throw overboard between 30 and 40 bales. The bale retrieved from the water by the Coast Guard contained 20 kilograms of cocaine. As the district court noted, the government\u2019s estimate of 600 kilograms was likely conservative. Thus, we affirm the district court\u2019s calculation of Sanclemente\u2019s advisory guidelines range of 135 to 168 months.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b715-11\">For all the reasons above, we affirm Sanclemente\u2019s concurrent 135-month sentences.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b715-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b713-13\">. Sanclemente also objected to not receiving a mitigating-role reduction, and was overruled. Sanclemente does not raise this issue on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b714-7\">. Sanclemente was sentenced at the same time and in the same hearing as several of his codefendants, including Arbelardo. During the hearing, the district court made certain statements in response to a request by one co-defendant to impose a sentence below the guidelines range. Sanclemente argues that these statements demonstrate that the district court imposed the guidelines in a mandatory manner. As this Court stated in Arboleda\u2019s appeal, we reject this reading of the district court\u2019s statements:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Adt\">It would have been improper for the district court to adopt a post <em>-Booker </em>rule that, in order to establish predictability and stability, sentences would still be within the guidelines range in its particular courtroom. Although the district court\u2019s statements arguably provide some support for defendant\u2019s contentions, we do not read the district court\u2019s statements in this case as creating any such <em>per se </em>rule. Rather, the district court expressly acknowledged that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"689\">*689</page-number>the guidelines were advisory and that \"the sentence imposed is sufficient, but no greater than necessary to comply with the statutory purposes of sentencing.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b715-7\"><em>United States v. Arbelardo, </em>159 Fed.Appx. 160, 162 n. 2 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b715-8\">. To the extent Sanclemente argues that the district court erred in relying upon the Coast Guard\u2019s reports because they are hearsay, this argument is without merit. <em>See United States v. Baker, </em>432 F.3d 1189, 1254-55 &amp; 1254 n. 68 (11th Cir.2005) (reaffirming <em>post-Booker </em>that district courts may rely on reliable hearsay to make sentencing determinations).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b715-25\">. In his brief, Sanclemente states that he \"adopts the arguments, together with their supporting citations of authority, filed on behalf of co-Appellants providing they inure to the benefit of the Appellant.\u201d This statement of adoption is ineffective because it does not comply with this Court\u2019s Rule 28 \u2014 1(f). Therefore, the only issues we address are those properly raised in Sanclemente's brief.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
