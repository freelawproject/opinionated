R.App. P. 4(b)(1)(A) (requiring criminal defendant to file notice of appeal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>within ten days of \u201cthe entry of either the judgment or the order being appealed\u201d). Appeals from denials of Rule 35 motions are controlled by the ten-day period dictated by Rule 4(b)(1)(A). <em>United States v. Garcia-Machado, </em>845 F.2d 492, 493 (5th Cir.1988). A timely notice of appeal is a mandatory prerequisite to our exercise of jurisdiction. <em>United States v. Cooper, </em>135 F.3d 960, 961 (5th Cir.1998). Because Richardson failed to file a notice of appeal for this denial, we lack jurisdiction to review her challenges to that decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-5\">Richardson did timely appeal from the final judgment of conviction and sentence. Fed. R.App. P. 4(b)(1)(A). She contends the district court erred in determining the amount of loss attributable to her for sentencing purposes. We review the court\u2019s interpretation and application of the Sentencing Guidelines <em>de novo; </em>its factual findings, for clear error. <em>E.g., United States v. Olis, </em>429 F.3d 540, 545 (5th Cir. 2005). A district court\u2019s amount-of-loss determination is <em>not </em>clearly erroneous if it is plausible in the light of the record as a whole. <em>E.g., United States v. Oates, </em>122 F.3d 222, 225 (5th Cir.1997). Along this line, the loss calculation was not clearly erroneous. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b389-6\">\n<em>DISMISSED in PART; AFFIRMED in PART.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b388-7\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
