Booker.</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>At our request, the parties have commented on the impact of <em>Booker. </em>We conclude that <em>Booker </em>does not affect Defendant-Appellant Jermaine Carlos Diaz\u2019s (\u201cDiaz\u201d) sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-18\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b911-19\">In 2001, a federal grand jury returned indictments charging Diaz with six counts: one count of enticement to travel in interstate commerce for purposes of prostitution, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2422(a); one count of transporting a minor in interstate commerce for purposes of prostitution, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2423(a); two counts of aiding and abetting violations of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2422(a) and 2423(a); and two counts of misprision of a felony, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4. Diaz was acquitted on four counts: The district court granted his motion for judgment of acquittal on the two misprision counts; and the jury acquitted Diaz on the enticement to travel in interstate commerce for purposes of prostitution and aiding and abetting counts. He was convicted, however, of the remaining two counts \u2014 transportation of a minor in interstate commerce for purposes of prostitution and aiding and abetting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"886\">*886</page-number>such transportation, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2423(a) and 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-4\">Following Diaz\u2019s conviction, the Probation Office prepared a Presentencing Report (\u201cPSR\u201d), which, under the then-mandatory Sentencing Guidelines (\u201cthe Guidelines\u201d or \u201cUSSG\u201d), calculated his offense level as 27, his criminal history category as II, and his resulting sentencing range as 78-97 months\u2019 imprisonment. In doing so, the PSR started with a base offense level of 14, pursuant to USSG \u00a7 2Gl.l(a). It increased that by four levels under USSG \u00a7 2Gl.l(b)(l) to account for Diaz\u2019s use of physical force, coercion, or threats in the commission of his crime; by seven more levels under USSG \u00a7 2Gl.l(b)(2)(B) to account for Diaz\u2019s victim being under the age of 16; and by another two levels under USSG \u00a7 3C1.1 to account for Diaz\u2019s obstruction of justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-5\">Diaz objected to these level increases. He complained that the increase for use of physical force, coercion, or threats was not justified \u201cbecause the jury specifically found the Defendant Not Guilty of\u2019 enticement to travel in interstate commerce for purposes of prostitution. He objected to the obstruction-of-justice increase because \u201c[tjhere was no testimony from [his victim] that she had been influenced in any manner.\u201d <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Finally, Diaz urged that he was entitled to a level reduction for acceptance of responsibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-11\">The district court overruled each of Diaz\u2019s objections, but granted his request for a two-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility, and granted another three-level reduction because of Diaz\u2019s young age at the time of his crime. These adjustments resulted in an offense level of 22, a criminal history category of II, and a sentencing range of 46-57 months. The district court sentenced Diaz in the middle of that range, i.e., to 51 months\u2019 imprisonment, as well as three years\u2019 supervised release and a $100 special assessment.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b912-12\">Notably, when Diaz appealed his <em>conviction </em>to us, he did <em>not </em>challenge his sentence or otherwise press the objections that he had made to the district court regarding its imposition of sentencing enhancements for obstruction-of-justice and the use of force, coercion, or threats. We affirmed his conviction in an unpublished opinion.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> It was only in an amended petition to the Supreme Court for a writ of certiorari that Diaz renewed his objection to the district court\u2019s imposition of sentencing enhancements for obstruction-of-justice and the use of force, coercion, or threats. In that amended petition, he contended that under <em>Blakely v. </em>Washington,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> the district court\u2019s reliance on facts that were not proven to the jury beyond a reasonable doubt to enhance his sentence violated his Sixth Amendment rights. Shortly thereafter, the Supreme Court handed down <em>Booker, </em>granted Diaz\u2019s amended petition for certiorari, and remanded this case to us for further consideration.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> We once again affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"887\">*887</page-number>II. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b913-5\">A. Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b913-6\">At the outset, the parties dispute our standard of review for Diaz\u2019s <em>Booker </em>claim. Diaz contends that he is entitled to <em>de novo </em>review of his claim because he \u201cobjected to the district court\u2019s judicial findings on the use of force, age of the victim, and obstruction of justice, and the enhancements based on those findings.\u201d The government disagrees, arguing that <em>plain error review </em>governs this case because \u201cthe <em>[Booker </em>] issue was not raised in the court below.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b913-7\">Diaz is simply wrong: Although his objections in the district court to the PSR\u2019s sentencing enhancement recommendations may have been sufficient to preserve his <em>Booker </em>claim for his <em>first </em>appeal, he <em>abandoned </em>that claim by failing to assert it the first time his case was before us.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> We are not as confident, however, about the propriety of the government\u2019s assertion that the plain error standard governs this case. Our decisions are legion that \u201cextraordinary circumstances\u201d review governs <em>Booker </em>claims raised for the first time in a petition for a writ of certiorari.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Diaz, however, did not raise his <em>Booker </em>claim for the <em>first </em>time in his cert petition; he took the unusual route of preserving his claim in the district court, abandoning it before us, and then <em>reasserting </em>it in the Supreme Court. Legal niceties aside, however, whether \u201cextraordinary circumstances\u201d or \u201cplain error\u201d review governs this case is irrelevant: As Diaz cannot meet even the requirements of plain error review, he certainly cannot meet the more onerous requirements of \u201cextraordinary circumstances\u201d review.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> We therefore assume <em>arguendo </em>that the plain error standard governs Diaz\u2019s case.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-14\">Under plain error review, we will not remand for resentencing unless there is \u201c(1) error, (2) that is plain, and (3) that affects substantial rights.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> If all three criteria are met, we may exercise our discretion to notice the error only if it \u201cseriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d <footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Under <em>Booker, </em>the district court\u2019s enhancement of Diaz\u2019s sentence under mandatory Guidelines based on facts not proven to the jury beyond a reasonable doubt (1) constitutes error that (2) is plain.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Whether the error affects substantial rights is a more complex inquiry for which Diaz bears the burden of proof. He will carry this burden only if he can \u201cshow[ ] that the error \u2018must have affected the outcome of the district court proceedings.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> That may be shown, in turn, by his \u201cdemonstration of] a probability \u2018sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> In other words, Diaz must identify in the record an indication that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"888\">*888</page-number>\u201csentencing judge \u2014 sentencing under an advisory [Guidelines] scheme rather than a mandatory one \u2014 -would have reached a significantly different result.\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b914-4\">B. Merits</p>\n<p id=\"b914-5\">In his supplemental letter brief, Diaz makes no attempt to cite to anything in the record indicating that there is a probability that the sentencing judge would have sentenced him differently under an advisory Guidelines scheme. Instead, he argues that the <em>Booker </em>error in this case affected his substantial rights \u201cbecause (1) <em>Booker </em>error is structural, or at least presumptively prejudicial; and (2), in any event, based on the judge-made, preponderance-of-the-evidence findings, he received a sentence greater than the maximum of the facts found by the jury.\u201d His first argument is foreclosed by our precedents<footnotemark>16</footnotemark>; his second merely states the error in this case that is plain without directing our attention to anything in the record indicating that he would have received a significantly different sentence under an advisory Guidelines scheme.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-6\">In essence, Diaz has done nothing more than preserve a challenge to the standard of review we adopted in <em>Mares, </em>arguing that in <em>Mares </em>we got it wrong, and that the plain error standard employed by other courts gets it right. <em>Mares </em>is the settled law of this circuit, however, and we may revisit it only <em>en banc </em>or following a Supreme Court decision that actually or effectively overturns it. We therefore affirm the sentence imposed by the district court below.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-7\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b914-8\">As Diaz cannot meet the requirements of plain error review or, by extension, extraordinary circumstances review, his sentence is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b911-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
