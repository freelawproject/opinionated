We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-10\">On appeal, Burgess first argues that his designation as an armed career criminal for sentencing purposes violates the Sixth Amendment as set forth in <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004). His argument is foreclosed by this court\u2019s decision in <em>United States v. Thompson, </em>421 F.3d 278 (4th Cir.2005), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 1463, 164 L.Ed.2d 250 (2005). Burgess does not dispute he has at least three prior convictions qualifying as \u201cviolent felonies\u201d and that they were \u201ccommitted on occasions different from one another.\u201d <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e) (2000). Because the facts necessary to support the enhancement under USSG \u00a7 4B1.4(b)(3)(B) \u201cinhere in the fact of conviction,\u201d there is no error under <em>Blakely, United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), or their progeny. <em>See Thompson, </em>421 F.3d at 283, 287 &amp; n. 5; <em>see also United States v. Cheek, </em>415 F.3d 349 (4th Cir.2005) (holding that the armed career criminal designation based on prior convictions does not violate <em>Booker), cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 640, 163 L.Ed.2d 518 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b302-16\">Burgess also claims that the calculation of his criminal history category violates the Sixth Amendment under <em>Blakely. </em>This argument is foreclosed by the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Booker </em>where the Court applied <em>Blakely </em>to the federal sentencing guidelines stating, \u201c[a]ny fact (other than a prior conviction) which is necessary to support a sentence exceeding the maximum authorized by the facts established by a plea of guilty or a jury verdict must be admitted by the defendant or proved to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Booker, </em>125 S.Ct. at 756.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-17\">Accordingly, we affirm Burgess\u2019 conviction and sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-18\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
