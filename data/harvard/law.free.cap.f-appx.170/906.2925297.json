By moving for IFP, Simmons is challenging the district court\u2019s certification that IFP status should not be granted on appeal because his appeal is not taken in good faith. <em>See Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b933-23\">The district court found that Simmons\u2019s assertion of a vast conspiracy by all levels of the state government and federal government was manifestly frivolous because the factual allegations were fanciful, irrational, incredible, and delusional. <em>See Neitzke v. Williams, </em>490 U.S. 319, 327, 109 S.Ct. 1827, 104 L.Ed.2d 338 (1989). Simmons has not briefed the district court\u2019s finding that his complaint is delusional, and thus has not adequately briefed the issue before the court on appeal. <em>Grant v. Cuellar, </em>59 F.3d 523, 524 (5th Cir.1995). Our review of Simmons\u2019s complaint con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"908\">*908</page-number>vinces us that the dismissal as frivolous was not an abuse of discretion. <em>See Siglar v. Hightower, </em>112 F.3d 191, 193 (5th Cir. 1997). We have also found no abuse of discretion in the imposition of monetary sanctions under Fed.R.Civ.P. 11. <em>Mendoza v. Lynaugh, </em>989 F.2d 191, 195 (5th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b934-4\">\u201c[N]othing prevents the appellate court from sua sponte dismissing the case on the merits pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 42.2 when it is apparent that an appeal would be meritless.\u201d <em>See Baugh, </em>117 F.3d at 202 n. 24. Simmons has failed to show that his appeal involves nonfrivolous issues, and his appeal is dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b934-5\">MOTION FOR IFP STATUS DENIED; APPEAL DISMISSED; MOTION TO EXPEDITE DENIED AS MOOT.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b933-15\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
