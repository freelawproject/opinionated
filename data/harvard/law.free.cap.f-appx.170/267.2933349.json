The order is not appealable unless a circuit justice or judge issues a certificate of appealability. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(1) (2000); <em>see Madley v. United States Parole Comm\u2019n, </em>278 F.3d 1306, 1310 (D.C.Cir. 2002) (reasoning that District of Columbia is a \u201cstate\u201d court for purposes of \u00a7 2253(e), and while a parole determination claim does not attack the original conviction or sentence, it nevertheless \u201carises out of\u2019 the original state process). A certificate of appealability will not issue absent \u201ca substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2) (2000). A prisoner satisfies this standard by demonstrating that reasonable jurists would find that the district court\u2019s assessment of his constitutional claims is debatable or wrong and that any dispositive procedural rulings by the district court also are debatable or wrong. <em>See Miller-El v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number><em>Cockrell, </em>537 U.S. 322, 336-38, 123 S.Ct. 1029, 154 L.Ed.2d 931 (2003); <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000); <em>Rose v. Lee, </em>252 F.3d 676, 683-84 (4th Cir.2001). We have independently reviewed the record and conclude that Garris has not made the requisite showing. Accordingly, we deny a certificate of appealability and dismiss the appeal. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-4\">\n<em>DISMISSED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
