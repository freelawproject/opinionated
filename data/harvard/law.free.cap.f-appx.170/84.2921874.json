Gutierrez seeks review of the final order by the Board of Immigration Appeals (\u201cBIA\u201d) affirming the decision of the immigration judge (\u201cIJ\u201d), which denied his petition for asylum, withholding of removal under the Immigration and Nationality Act (\u201cINA\u201d) and the United Nations Convention on Torture, etc. (\u201cCAT\u201d), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1158, 1231, 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.16(c). After review, we dismiss the petition for review for lack of jurisdiction to the extent it seeks review of the BIA\u2019s April 14, 2005 final order. We deny the petition to the extent it seeks review of the BIA\u2019s June 15, 2005 order denying Gutierrez\u2019s motion for reconsideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-29\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b110-30\">Gutierrez, a native and citizen of Colombia, was admitted to the United States on March 11, 2001, as a non-immigrant visitor and was authorized to stay until September 10, 2001. Gutierrez remained in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>United States past that date and, on May 6, 2002, filed an application for asylum and withholding of removal. The Immigration and Naturalization Service issued a Notice to Appear, charging Gutierrez with removability.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-5\">After an asylum hearing, the IJ denied Gutierrez all relief and ordered his removal. The IJ determined that Gutierrez\u2019s asylum claim was time-barred because he had not filed his asylum application within one year after he had entered the United States, as required by INA \u00a7 208(a)(2)(D), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(2)(B), and had failed to show exceptional circumstances to excuse his delay. Alternatively, the IJ found that Gutierrez did not meet his burden of proof to show eligibility for asylum, withholding of removal or CAT relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-6\">Gutierrez appealed the IJ\u2019s order of removal to the BIA. On April 14, 2005, the BIA adopted and affirmed the IJ\u2019s decision and dismissed Gutierrez\u2019s appeal. On April 25, 2005, Gutierrez filed a motion for reconsideration, which the BIA denied on June 15, 2005. Gutierrez filed his petition for review with this Court on July 11, 2005. The government moved to dismiss this appeal for lack of jurisdiction, arguing that Gutierrez\u2019s petition for review is untimely.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-7\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"As7\">A. April 14, 2005 Final Order</p>\n<p id=\"b111-8\">A petitioner must file a petition for review with this Court within thirty days after the date of the final order of removal. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(1). \u201cSince the statutory limit for filing a petition for review in an immigration proceeding is \u2018mandatory and jurisdictional,\u2019 it is not subject to equitable tolling.\u201d <em>Dakane v. United States Att\u2019y Gen., </em>399 F.3d 1269, 1272 n. 3 (11th Cir.2005) (citing <em>Stone v. INS, </em>514 U.S. 386, 405, 115 S.Ct. 1537, 1549, 131 L.Ed.2d 465 (1995)). The finality of a removal order is not affected by the filing of a motion to reconsider. <em>Stone, </em>514 U.S. at 405,115 S.Ct. at 1549.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-10\">Here, the BIA\u2019s April 14, 2005 order, affirming the IJ\u2019s decision and dismissing Gutierrez\u2019s appeal, was a final order of removal. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1241.1(a). Gutierrez filed his petition for review on July 11, 2005, more than thirty days after the BIA\u2019s April 14, 2005 final order. Thus, we lack jurisdiction to review the April 14, 2005 final order.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-11\">B. June 15, 2005 Order Denying Motion for Reconsideration</p>\n<p id=\"b111-12\">Because Gutierrez\u2019s petition for review was filed within thirty days of the BIA\u2019s June 15, 2005 order denying his motion for reconsideration, we have jurisdiction to review that order. We review the BIA\u2019s denial of a motion for reconsideration for an abuse of discretion. <em>Assa\u2019ad v. United States Att\u2019y Gen., </em>332 F.3d 1321, 1341 (11th Cir.2003). However, when an argument is not raised in the initial brief before this Court, the argument is deemed abandoned on appeal. <em>Mendoza v. United States Att\u2019y Gen., </em>327 F.3d 1283, 1286 n. 3 (11th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b111-13\">Gutierrez does not challenge the denial of his motion for reconsideration in his appeal brief. Instead, his arguments focus on his underlying asylum and withholding of removal claims and the merits of the BIA\u2019s April 14, 2005 order. Therefore, Gutierrez has abandoned his claim with regard to the BIA\u2019s June 15, 2005 order denying his motion for reconsideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-14\">For the above stated reasons, we dismiss the petition as it relates to the April 14, 2005 order affirming the IJ\u2019s order of removal and deny the petition as it relates to the June 15, 2005 order denying Guitierrez\u2019s motion for reconsideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>DISMISSED IN PART, DENIED IN PART.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
