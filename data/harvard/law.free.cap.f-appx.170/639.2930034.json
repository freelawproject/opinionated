On ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"640\">*640</page-number>peal, Cook argues that the government violated <em>Brady v. Maryland, </em>373 U.S. 83, 83 S.Ct. 1194, 10 L.Ed.2d 215 (1963), and <em>Giglio v. United States, </em>405 U.S. 150, 92 S.Ct. 763, 31 L.Ed.2d 104 (1972), through its failure to disclose a trial witness\u2019s criminal history from 1999 to 2001, the fact that the witness was on probation at the time he testified at Cook\u2019s trial, and the fact that probation revocation proceedings had commenced against the witness. Cook further argues that the district court erred in applying the standard for evaluating a motion for a new trial based on newly discovered evidence instead of the standard for evaluating such a motion based on <em>Brady </em>evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-4\">Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 33(a) provides that \u201c[u]pon the defendant\u2019s motion, the court may vacate any judgment and grant a new trial if the interest of justice so requires.\u201d \u201cWe review the district court\u2019s denial of a motion for new trial based on newly discovered evidence for abuse of discretion. Similarly, a district court\u2019s denial of a motion for new trial based on a <em>Brady </em>violation is reviewed for abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>United States v. Vallejo, </em>297 F.3d 1154, 1163 (11th Cir.2002) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b666-5\">To obtain a new trial based on a <em>Brady </em>claim of newly discovered evidence, the defendant must show that: \u201c(1) the government possessed favorable evidence to the defendant; (2) the defendant does not possess the evidence and could not obtain the evidence with any reasonable diligence; (3) the prosecution suppressed the favorable evidence; and (4) had the evidence been disclosed to the defendant, there is a reasonable probability that the outcome would have been different.\u201d <em>Vallejo, </em>297 F.3d at 1164. \u201cEvidence favorable to the accused includes impeachment evidence.\u201d <em>United States v. Newton, </em>44 F.3d 913, 918 (11th Cir.1994). A \u201creasonable probability\u201d is \u201ca probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome.\u201d <em>United States v. Bagley, </em>473 U.S. 667, 682, 105 S.Ct. 3375, 3383, 87 L.Ed.2d 481 (1985) (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b666-7\">Here, the district court erred because it evaluated Cook\u2019s motion for a new trial using the standard for a Rule 33 motion based on newly discovered evidence instead of a Rule 33 motion based on <em>Brady </em>evidence. <em>See United States v. Thompson, </em>422 F.3d 1285, 1294 (11th Cir.2005) (outlining framework for evaluating a Rule 33 motion for new trial); <em>but see Vallejo, </em>297 F.3d at 1164 (setting forth standard for prevailing upon a Rule 33 motion based on a <em>Brady </em>violation). However, we will not remand unless doing so \u201cwould serve [a] valid purpose.\u201d <em>See United States v. Bascaro, </em>742 F.2d 1335, 1344 (11th Cir.1984). We therefore consider whether Cook can establish a <em>Brady </em>claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-8\">Applying the standard for a new trial based on a <em>Brady </em>violation and assuming the government possessed and suppressed information about the trial witness\u2019s complete criminal history, Cook has not shown that he could not have possessed this evidence with reasonable diligence. <em>See Vallejo, </em>297 F.3d at 1164. Rather, as demonstrated by the attachments to the motion for a new trial, information about the witness\u2019s criminal history and probationary status was publicly available. In addition, Cook has not demonstrated that a reasonable probability existed that the outcome of his trial would have been different had he received a more complete evidence about the witness\u2019s criminal history. <em>See id. </em>Evidence at trial showed that Cook sold cocaine to a confidential informant and was arrested when he tried to complete a second drug transaction with the informant. Because Cook is unable to establish a <em>Brady </em>claim, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"641\">*641</page-number>remand would serve no valid purpose. <em>See Bascaro, </em>742 F.2d at 1344.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-5\">Based on a review of the parties\u2019 briefs and the record on appeal, we discern no reversible error. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
