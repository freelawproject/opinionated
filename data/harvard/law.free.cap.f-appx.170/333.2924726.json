He seeks a certificate of appealability (COA) to appeal the district court\u2019s dismissal as untimely of his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 petition challenging this conviction. Pierce\u2019s motion to compel this court to consider his COA application in an expedient manner is DENIED.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-6\">In order to obtain a COA, Pierce must show \u201cthat jurists of reason would find it debatable whether the petition states a valid claim of the denial of a constitutional right and that jurists of reason would find it debatable whether the district court was correct in its procedural ruling.\u201d <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000). Pierce has established that reasonable jurists would debate whether the district court correctly dismissed his federal petition as untimely pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)(1). <em>See Foreman v. Dretke, </em>383 F.3d 336, 340 (5th Cir.2004); Tex.R.App. P. 49.1, 49.8, 68.2(a). Pierce\u2019s allegations in the district court and in his COA application \u201cdemonstrate that reasonable jurists could debate whether [Pierce] has made a valid claim of a constitutional dimension.\u201d <em>Houser v. Dretke, </em>395 F.3d 560, 562 (5th Cir.2004). Consequently, Pierce\u2019s motion for a COA is GRANTED, and the case is REMANDED for further proceedings consistent with this ruling. Pierce\u2019s motion for appointment of counsel on appeal is DENIED.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-10\">COA GRANTED; MOTION FOR APPOINTMENT OF COUNSEL DENIED; MOTION TO COMPEL DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b360-7\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
