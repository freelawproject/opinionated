The district court entered a detailed order that, among other things, denied the defendants\u2019 motions for summary judgment. The district court found that, \u201c[a]s there is an abundance of case law from this circuit defining the parameters of deliberate indifference, the defense of qualified immunity is not available to a defendant guilty of deliberate indifference to serious medical needs.\u201d Finding that a reasonable jury could conclude that the defendants were deliberately indifferent to Kassandra Kim-bell\u2019s medical needs on the night of her death, the court concluded that genuine issues of material fact existed and denied the defendants\u2019 motions for summary judgment as to Kimbell\u2019s federal claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-24\">Concerning the defendants\u2019 arguments for official immunity under Georgia law, the district court found that, viewing the evidence most favorable to Kimbell, it could not find, as a matter of law, that the defendants \u201cdid not intend to wrongfully delay or deny [Kassandra] Kimbell needed access to medical care\u201d and, thus, could not find that the defendants were entitled to official immunity for Kimbell\u2019s claims of wrongful death or outrageous conduct. The defendants then filed timely interlocu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"664\">*664</page-number>tory appeals from the district court\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-4\">First, we conclude that we have appellate jurisdiction over this appeal. Although both this court and the Supreme Court have held that a denial of qualified immunity is not immediately appealable where the only issue is evidence sufficiency, the denial of qualified immunity may be appealed to the extent that it turns on an issue of law. <em>Johnson v. Jones, 515 </em>U.S. 304, 313, 115 S.Ct. 2151, 2156, 132 L.Ed.2d 238 (1995); <em>Mitchell v. Forsyth, </em>472 U.S. 511, 525-30, 105 S.Ct. 2806, 2815-17, 86 L.Ed.2d 411 (1985); <em>Koch v. Rugg, </em>221 F.3d 1283, 1295-98 (11th Cir.2000); <em>Rich v. Dollar, </em>841 F.2d 1558, 1560 (11th Cir. 1988). Thus, where a district court has determined that a state actor\u2019s conduct constituted a violation of clearly established law, an interlocutory appeal is available. <em>Behrens v. Pelletier, </em>516 U.S. 299, 313, 116 S.Ct. 834, 842, 133 L.Ed.2d 773 (1996). Furthermore, a district court\u2019s denial of summary judgment based on a claim of qualified immunity because genuine issues of material fact existed is an immediately appealable order because the district court\u2019s determination that genuine issues of material fact preclude summary judgment is itself a conclusion of law. <em>McDaniel v. Woodard, </em>886 F.2d 311, 313 (11th Cir.1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b690-5\">In this case, we agree with the district court\u2019s finding that genuine issues of material fact exist as to whether defendants were deliberately indifferent to Kassandra Kimbell\u2019s serious medical needs.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>McDaniel, </em>886 F.2d at 313. Additionally, we agree with the district court\u2019s finding that deliberate indifference to serious medical needs is a violation of clearly established law. <em>See Behrens, </em>516 U.S. at 313, 116 S.Ct. at 842. Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s order denying the defendants\u2019 motions for summary judgment based on qualified and official immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b690-6\">. The record demonstrates that, while she was in the defendants' custody in the Clayton County, Georgia jail, Kassandra Kimbell died of complications as a result of a ruptured ectopic pregnancy.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
