He challenges the constitutionality of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)\u2019s treatment of prior felony and aggravated felony convictions as sentencing factors rather than elements of the offense that must be found by a jury in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b902-4\">Cervantes-Blaneo\u2019s constitutional challenge is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). Although Cervantes-Blanco contends that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>was incorrectly decided and that a majority of the Supreme Court would overrule <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>in light of <em>Apprendi, </em>we have repeatedly rejected such arguments on the basis that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>remains binding. <em>See United States v. Garza-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d 268, 276 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 298, 163 L.Ed.2d 260 (2005). Cervantes-Bianco properly concedes that his argument is foreclosed in light of <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>and circuit precedent, but raises it here to preserve it for further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-7\">Cervantes-Bianco also contends that the district court committed reversible error when it sentenced him pursuant to the mandatory United States Sentencing Guidelines held unconstitutional in <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). Further, Cervantes-Bianco argues that the district court erred when it enhanced his sentence based on a finding that his state conviction for attempted second degree kidnaping was a crime of violence.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-11\">The district court erred when it sentenced Cervantes-Bianco pursuant to a mandatory guidelines system. <em>See United States v. Valenzuela-Quevedo, </em>407 F.3d 728, 733 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied</em>, \u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 267, 163 L.Ed.2d 240 (2005). This error was more like that experienced by the other respondent in <em>Booker, </em>Ducan Fanfan. <em>See United States v. Martinez-Lugo, </em>411 F.3d 597, 600 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 464, 163 L.Ed.2d 352 (2005). Because Cervantes-Bianco preserved his Fanfan challenge in the district court by raising an objection based on <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), we review for harmless error. <em>United States v. Walters, </em>418 F.3d 461, 463 (5th Cir.2005). The Government bears the burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that the district court would not have sentenced Cervantes-Bianco differently under an advisory guidelines system. <em>See id. </em>at 464.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b902-16\">The Government concedes that the district court erred when it sentenced Cervantes-Bianco pursuant to a mandatory guidelines system and that the error was not harmless. A review of the sentencing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"877\">*877</page-number>transcript supports the Government\u2019s concession. We therefore vacate CervantesBlaneo\u2019s sentence and remand the case for resentencing. Because we remand based on the Fanfan error, we need not address Cervantes-Blanco\u2019s other claimed sentencing error. <em>See United States v. Akpan, </em>407 F.3d 360, 377 n. 62 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b903-5\">CONVICTION AFFIRMED; SENTENCE VACATED; CASE REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b901-20\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion, should not be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"876\">*876</page-number>published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b902-9\">. Although we must follow the panel\u2019s decision in <em>Walters, United States v. Ruiz, </em>180 F.3d 675, 676 (5th Cir.1999), we note that the standard of review it applied \u2014 requiring the Government to show that preserved Fanfan error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt \u2014 was not contested in the case and appears to be incorrect because Fanfan error is nonconstitutional error, <em>see United States v. Hughes, </em>401 F.3d 540, 553 (4th Cir.2005) (pointing out that Fanfan error, unlike <em>Booker </em>error, is nonconstitutional). Rather, \"harmless error\u201d in Fanfan cases is defined by the standard announced in <em>Kotteakos v. United States, </em>328 U.S. 750, 776, 66 S.Ct. 1239, 90 L.Ed. 1557 (1946). <em>See United States v. Hernandez-Guevara, </em>162 F.3d 863, 876 (5th Cir. 1998) (applying <em>Kotteakos </em>to preserved non-constitutional error). But the issue is irrelevant here because the Government cannot meet either burden.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
