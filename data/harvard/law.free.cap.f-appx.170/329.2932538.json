Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). Because Ramos preserved the <em>Fanfan </em>error in the district court, we review for harmless error. <em>See United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511, 520 n. 9 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 43, 163 L.Ed.2d 76 (2005). The Government has not met its burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that the district judge would have imposed the same sentence under an advisory guidelines regime. <em>See United States v. Walters, </em>418 F.3d 461, 463-65 (5th Cir.2005). Therefore, Ramos\u2019 sentence is vacated; the case remanded to district court for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-27\">Ramos also maintains the \u201cfelony\u201d and \u201caggravated felony\u201d provisions of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b) are unconstitutional. This issue is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number><em>United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). Although Ramos contends <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>was incorrectly decided and that a majority of the Supreme Court would overrule it in the light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), we have repeatedly rejected such contentions on the basis that <em>AlmendarezTorres </em>remains binding. <em>See United States v. Garza-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d 268, 276 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 298, 163 L.Ed.2d 260 (2005). Ramos concedes <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>and circuit precedent foreclose this claim; he raises it to preserve it for further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-6\">\n<em>CONVICTION AFFIRMED; SENTENCE VACATED; REMANDED FOR RESENTENCING.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b355-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
