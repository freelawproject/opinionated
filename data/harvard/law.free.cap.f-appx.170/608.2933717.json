Saudi Basic Industries Corp., </em>544 U.S. 280, 125 S.Ct. 1517, 161 L.Ed.2d 454 (2005). We previously affirmed the district court\u2019s entry of summary judgment in favor of the Alabama Department of Transportation (\u201cALDOT\u201d), several individually named ALDOT employees, and an ALDOT contractor. <em>See Sophocleus v. Alabama, </em>116 Fed. Appx. 246 (11th Cir. 2004) (Table) <em>(\u201cSophocleus </em>J\u201d). The Supreme Court vacated our prior opinion and remanded for further consideration in light of <em>Exxon Mobil, </em>in which the Court clarified the scope and applicability of the Rooker-Feldman<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> doctrine.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-19\">As we discussed in greater detail in our prior, now-vacated opinion, Appellants sued the ALDOT Defendants, alleging that they had taken Appellants\u2019 home for private use from January 1999 through August 1999 without just compensation, in violation of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983; 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1985; and state laws of trespass, invasion of privacy, and outrage. The district court concluded it lacked subject matter jurisdiction under the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine based on previously resolved state court actions concerning the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"610\">*610</page-number>In the state court proceedings, an Alabama probate court entered an order of condemnation, appointed a commission to determine the amount of \u201cjust compensation\u201d for the property, and, after numerous commission appraisals and objections by the Appellants, set a price for the Appellants\u2019 land. When Appellants refused to move, a second state court action \u2014 an eviction proceeding \u2014 -was initiated and resolved relating to the property. After moving from the property, Appellants settled the first action (the condemnation proceeding) and the probate court entered a final order and decree of condemnation. Notably, after Appellants received the negotiated price for their property, pursuant to the settlement terms, they did not challenge the resolution in a state appellate court in Alabama.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-4\">Instead, Appellants filed this action, alleging that their settlement in the condemnation proceeding was unreasonable and unfair and arguing that they were entitled to, but did not receive, relocation expenses. They also contended that they had not received \u201cjust compensation\u201d during the state-court proceedings. As we noted in <em>Sophocleus I, </em>\u201cAppellants could have, but did not, raise the instant arguments in the Alabama courts through a challenge to the negotiated settlement in the condemnation case.\u201d The district court concluded that Appellants could not challenge the negotiated settlement of the condemnation proceeding in federal court due to the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-5\">In <em>Exxon Mobil, </em>the Supreme Court observed that the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine \u201crecognizes that 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331 is a grant of original jurisdiction, and does not authorize district courts to exercise appellate jurisdiction over state-court judgments, which Congress has reserved to this Court, see \u00a7 1257(a).\u201d 125 S.Ct. at 1526. The Court discussed (and limited) the application of <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>to cases similar to the present action: \u201ccases brought by state-court losers complaining of injuries caused by state-court judgments rendered before the district court proceedings commenced and inviting district court review and rejection of those judgments.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1521-22. However, the Court also noted that where a plaintiff presents \u201can independent claim, albeit one that denies a legal conclusion that a state court has reached in a case to which he was a party, then there is <em>jurisdiction </em>and state law determines whether the defendant prevails under principles of <em>preclusion. </em>\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1527 (internal alterations and citation omitted) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b636-7\">Under the circumstances, it is necessary that the matter receive further consideration in the district court in light of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision. Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is vacated and the cause is remanded for consideration in light of the Supreme Court\u2019s opinion in <em>Exxon Mobil.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b636-8\">VACATED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b635-13\">. <em>See D.C.
