Further, Liu argues that his attempt to gain political asylum in the United States will subject him to torture if he returns to China, as the government views those who apply for political asylum as political enemies. He argues that his asylum application was unfairly denied, and his appeal to the BIA was unfairly dismissed. In response, the government argues that we lack jurisdiction to consider claims regarding the BIA\u2019s denial of the asylum application.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-5\">We consider <em>de novo </em>whether we have subject-matter jurisdiction. <em>See Brooks v. Ashcroft, </em>283 F.3d 1268, 1272 (11th Cir. 2002). By statute, an alien seeking review of a final order of the BIA must file a petition for review within 30 days of the issuance of the final order. INA \u00a7 242(b)(1); 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(1). An order of removal becomes final upon, <em>inter alia, </em>the dismissal of an appeal by the BIA. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1241.1(a). \u201c[T]he statutory limit for filing a petition for review in an immigration proceeding is \u2018mandatory and jurisdictional,\u2019 [and, therefore,] it is not subject to equitable tolling.\u201d <em>Dakane v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>399 F.3d 1269, 1272 n. 3 (11th Cir.2005) (quoting <em>Stone v. INS, </em>514 U.S. 386, 405, 115 S.Ct. 1537, 1549, 131 L.Ed.2d 465 (1995)). The late filing of a motion to reopen or reconsider does not affect the need to file a separate petition appealing the deportation order. <em>Stone, </em>514 U.S. at 394, 115 S.Ct. at 1543-44.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-6\">Because the record here demonstrates that the BIA denied all relief and issued its final order of removal on June 29, 2004, and Liu did not file a petition for review within the regulatory deadline, we have no jurisdiction to review the denial of asylum, withholding of removal, and CAT relief. Accordingly, our jurisdiction is limited to reviewing the BIA\u2019s April 11, 2005 decision denying Liu\u2019s motion for reconsideration. We dismiss that portion of Liu\u2019s petition challenging the underlying ruling for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-7\">Liu also argues without elaboration that his motion to reopen was unfairly denied. Even construing his <em>pro se </em>brief liberally, <em>see Saleem v. Evans, </em>866 F.2d 1313, 1316 (11th Cir.1989), merely mentioning a claim is not sufficient to avoid a finding that the issue is abandoned, <em>see Allison v. McGhan Med. Corp., </em>184 F.3d 1300, 1317 n. 17 (11th Cir.1999) (\u201cIssues that are not clearly outlined in an appellant\u2019s initial brief are deemed abandoned.\u201d). Liu\u2019s arguments were that he was entitled to asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under CAT because of the continuing political stance China takes towards family planning and those who seek political asylum. As explained above, those arguments are an attempt to advance a claim over which we lack jurisdiction, as Liu did not file a timely appeal from the BIA\u2019s final removal order. <em>(See generally, </em>administrative papers at 12, A.R. at 27). We could deny the petition as to the reconsideration order for this reason alone. <em>See Allison, </em>184 F.3d at 1317 n. 17. However, petitioner\u2019s claim fails on the merits as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-8\">We review the BIA\u2019s denial of a motion to reopen for an abuse of discretion, and \u201cthe BIA\u2019s discretion is quite broad.\u201d <em>Gbaya v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>342 F.3d 1219, 1220 (11th Cir.2003) (quotation omitted). Only one motion to reopen is allowed, and it must be filed within 90 days of the date <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"643\">*643</page-number>of the BIA\u2019s final administrative removal order. <em>See </em>INA \u00a7 240(c)(6)(A), (C)(i), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(6)(A),(c)(i).</p>\n<p id=\"b669-5\">The regulations provide that, \u201c[a] motion to reopen proceedings shall state the new facts that will be proven at a hearing to be held if the motion is granted and shall be supported by affidavits or other evidentiary material.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(1). Such motion \u201cshall not be granted unless it appears to the [BIA] that evidence sought to be offered is material and was not available and could not have been discovered or presented at the former hearing.\u201d <em>Id. See also, </em>INA \u00a7 240(c)(7)(B), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(7)(B) (stating that the motion \u201cshall state the new facts that -will be proven at a hearing to be held if the motion is granted, and shall be supported by affidavits or other evidentiary material.\u201d). There is an exception to the filing deadline contained in the regulations when the motion \u201cis based on changed country conditions arising in the country of nationality or the country to which removal has been ordered, if such evidence is material and was not available and could not have been discovered or presented at the previous proceeding.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.23(b)(4)(i).</p>\n<p id=\"b669-7\">We have stated that the congressional filing deadlines should be read literally by federal courts and held that the time limitations in INA \u00a7 242B(c)(3)(A) were \u201cjurisdictional and mandatory.\u201d <em>Anin v. Reno, </em>188 F.3d 1273, 1278 (11th Cir.1999). Further, \u201c[m]otions to reopen are disfavored, especially in a removal proceeding, \u2018where, as a general matter, every delay works to the advantage of the deportable alien who wishes merely to remain in the United States.\u2019 \u201d <em>Abdi v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>430 F.3d 1148, 1149 (11th Cir.2005) (citation omitted). We noted that, although the limitation in 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(2) may be subject to the doctrine of equitable tolling, \u201c[u]nder Anin\u2019s rationale, the statutory 90-day period for filing a notice of appeal is mandatory and jurisdictional, and, therefore, it is not subject to equitable tolling.... [O]ur reasoning in <em>Anin </em>is not specific to <em>in absentia </em>orders.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b669-9\">We conclude from the record that the BIA did not err by denying Liu\u2019s untimely motion to reopen the hearing based on his wife\u2019s pregnancy because the pregnancy was not a changed circumstance which excuses the untimeliness nor is it a basis to grant asylum relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-10\">For the above stated reasons, we dismiss the petition in part and deny the petition in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-11\">PETITION DISMISSED IN PART, DENIED IN PART.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
