Cruz claims that the district court erred in applying Sentencing Guidelines \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(vii) because transportation of illegal aliens is not \u201calien smuggling\u201d. Cruz concedes this claim is foreclosed by <em>United States v. Solis-Campozano, </em>312 F.3d 164, 167-68 (5th Cir. 2002), which held \u201calien smuggling offense\u201d includes the offense of transporting aliens within the United States. He raises this issue to preserve it for further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-19\">Cruz also claims the district court reversibly erred under <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005) by sentencing him pursuant to a mandatory application of the sentencing guidelines. There was no <em>\u201cBooker\u201d </em>error (Sixth Amendment violation) because the only enhancement to Cruz\u2019s sentence was for his prior conviction. <em>See Booker, </em>125 S.Ct. at 756, 769. Nevertheless, the district court committed <em>\u201cFanfan </em>\u201d error by sentencing Cruz pursuant to a mandatory guidelines system. <em>See United States v. Walters, </em>418 F.3d 461, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>463-64 (5th Cir.2005). A <em>Fanfan </em>error is not structural error. <em>See United States v. Martinez-Lugo, </em>411 F.3d 597, 601 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 464, 163 L.Ed.2d 352 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b375-7\">The Government concedes that Cruz preserved his <em>Fanfan </em>claim. Accordingly, we review for harmless error beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>See Walters, </em>418 F.3d at 464. There is no evidence in the record that the district court would have imposed the same sentence had the guidelines been advisory. Accordingly, we vacate the sentence and remand for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-8\">Cruz contends that the \u201cfelony\u201d and \u201caggravated felony\u201d provisions of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(1) and (b)(2) are unconstitutional on their face, and as applied in his case, in the light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). Cruz\u2019s constitutional challenge is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). Although Cruz contends that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>was incorrectly decided and that a majority of the Supreme Court would overrule it in the light of <em>Apprendi, </em>we have repeatedly rejected such arguments on the basis that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>remains binding. <em>See United States v. Garza-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d 268, 276 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 298, 163 L.Ed.2d 260 (2005). Cruz properly concedes that his claim is foreclosed; he raises it to preserve it for further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-11\">\n<em>CONVICTION AFFIRMED; SENTENCE VACATED; AND REMANDED FOR RESENTENCING.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b374-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
