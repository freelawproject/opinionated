We find no evidence in the record that the July 17, 2001 order of removal was ever rescinded. Thus, Woldemariam was no longer a lawful permanent resident and was not eligible for the \u00a7 212(c) waiver. Accordingly, Woldemariam\u2019s contention lacks merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-5\">Woldemariam further asserts that the court violated his due process rights when it determined that he was ineligible for the \u00a7 212(c) waiver and \u00a7 212(a)(2)(A)(ii) petty offense exception based on the allegation of multiple convictions for which he was never charged in the Notice to Appear. This argument is also without merit. First, the denial of a request for a waiver of inadmissibility pursuant to \u00a7 212(c) cannot constitute a due process violation, because an alien has no constitutionally-protected liberty or property interest in the \u201cright\u201d to discretionary relief. <em>See Smith v. Ashcroft, </em>295 F.3d 425, 429 (4th Cir.2002). Moreover, Woldemariam\u2019s application for a \u00a7 212(c) waiver was denied because he was not a lawful permanent resident, not because he allegedly had multiple convictions. Finally, Woldemariam was denied eligibility for the \u00a7 212(a)(2)(A)(ii) exception because he faced a maximum of five years in prison for his forgery conviction, not because of multiple convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-6\">Accordingly the petition for review is denied. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-7\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
