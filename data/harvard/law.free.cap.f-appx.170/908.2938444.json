He does not challenge the district court\u2019s calculation of his guideline sentencing range.</p>\n<p id=\"b935-5\">Because Rojas\u2019s sentence was within a properly calculated guideline range of 57 to 71 months, we infer that the district court considered all the factors for a fair sentence set forth in the Guidelines. <em>See United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511, 519 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 43, 163 L.Ed.2d 76 (2005). \u201c[A] sentence within a properly calculated Guideline range is presumptively reasonable.\u201d <em>United States v. Alonzo, </em>435 F.3d 551, 554 (5th Cir.2006). Rojas has failed to demonstrate that his properly calculated guidelines sentence was unreasonable. <em>See id.; Mares, </em>402 F.3d at 519.</p>\n<p id=\"b935-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b934-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
