Counsel for Appellants filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), raising as a potential issue that Appellants\u2019 sentences violated <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), and <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). They argue that their sentences must be vacated because the district court treated the federal sentencing guidelines as mandatory and applied sentencing enhancements based on factual findings that were neither alleged in the indictment nor admitted by them, and the court did not consider 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3553(a) (West 2000 &amp; Supp. 2005) when sentencing them. We affirm the convictions, vacate the sentences, and remand for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-21\">In <em>Booker, </em>the Supreme Court held that the mandatory manner in which the federal sentencing guidelines required courts to impose sentencing enhancements based on facts found by the court by a preponderance of the evidence violated the Sixth Amendment. 125 S.Ct. at 746, 750 (Stevens, J., opinion of the Court). The Court remedied the constitutional violation by severing two statutory provisions, 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3553(b)(1) (West Supp.2005) (requiring sentencing courts to impose a sentence within the applicable guideline range), and 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3742(e) (West 2000 &amp; Supp.2005) (setting forth appellate standards of review for guideline issues), thereby making the guidelines advisory. <em>United States v. Hughes, </em>401 F.3d 540, 546 (4th Cir.2005) (citing <em>Booker, </em>125 S.Ct. at 756-67 (Breyer, J., opinion of the Court)).</p>\n<p id=\"b303-22\">After <em>Booker, </em>courts must calculate the appropriate guideline range, consider the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>range in conjunction with other relevant factors under the guidelines and 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3553(a), and impose a sentence. If a district court imposes a sentence outside the guideline range, the court must state its reasons for doing so. <em>Hughes, </em>401 F.3d at 546. This remedial scheme applies to any sentence imposed under the mandatory guidelines, regardless of whether the sentence violates the Sixth Amendment. <em>Id. </em>at 547 (citing <em>Booker, </em>125 S.Ct. at 769 (Breyer, J., opinion of the Court)).</p>\n<p id=\"b304-4\">Here, the district court sentenced Appellants under the mandatory federal sentencing guidelines and established a total offense level by determining amount of loss, number of victims involved, and whether the Defendants possessed device-making equipment. The resulting guideline ranges exceeded those authorized by the admitted conduct. Thus, the sentences, based on facts found by the district court at sentencing, violate the Sixth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-5\">In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the entire record in these cases for any other meritorious issues on appeal and have found none. Accordingly, although we affirm the convictions, we vacate the sentences, and remand for resentencing. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-6\">\n<em>AFFIRMED IN PART, VACATED IN PART, AND REMANDED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
