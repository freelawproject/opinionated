INS, </em>296 F.3d 316, 324 n. 13 (4th Cir.2002) (citing <em>INS v. Stevie, </em>467 U.S. 407, 430, 104 S.Ct. 2489, 81 L.Ed.2d 321 (1984)). Based on our review of the record, we find that Bazie failed to make the requisite showing before the immigration court. We therefore uphold the denial of his request for withholding of removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-9\">Bazie also challenges the denial of his claim for protection under the Convention Against Torture. Because he failed to raise this claim before the Board, we find that we have no jurisdiction to consider this claim. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(d)(1) (2000) (\u201cA court may review a final order of removal only if ... the alien has exhausted all administrative remedies available to the alien as of right.\u201d); <em>Asika v. Ashcroft, </em>362 F.3d 264, 267 n. 3 (4th Cir. 2004), <em>cert. denied, </em>543 U.S. 1049, 125 S.Ct. 861, 160 L.Ed.2d 769 (2005) (holding that we lack jurisdiction to consider an argument that was not raised before the Board).</p>\n<p id=\"b298-14\">Accordingly, we deny the petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-15\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b298-10\"> Bazie does not challenge the Board\u2019s finding that he was statutorily barred from asylum. He has therefore waived appellate review of his asylum claim. <em>See Edwards v. City of Goldsboro, </em>178 F.3d 231, 241 n. 6 (4th Cir. 1999).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
