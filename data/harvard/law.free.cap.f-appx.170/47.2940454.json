On appeal, Giddens argues that the district court erred under <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 756, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), by enhancing his sentence pursuant to the Armed Career Criminal provision because the fact and characterization of the prior convictions were not alleged in the indictment or proved to the jury beyond a reasonable doubt. Giddens interprets <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), <em>to </em>state that the use of a prior conviction to enhance a sentence violates the Fifth and Sixth Amendments the same as any other fact</p>\n<p id=\"b73-18\">Next, Giddens argues for the first time on appeal that it is unclear what documents the court viewed in determining that his prior convictions qualified as predicate offenses within the meaning of the Armed Career Criminal Act (\u201cACCA\u201d). Giddens notes the Supreme Court\u2019s holding in <em>Shepard v. United States, </em>544 U.S. 13, 125 S.Ct. 1254, 161 L.Ed.2d 205 (2005), which restricts the types of documents that the court can view in assessing whether a prior conviction is a qualifying offense under the ACCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-19\">We affirm. We have made clear that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>\u201cwas left undisturbed by <em>Apprendi, Blakely, </em>and <em>Booker. </em>\u201d <em>United States v. Shelton, </em>400 F.3d 1325, 1329 (11th Cir.2005). Moreover, we have noted that, while recent decisions, including <em>Shepard, </em>may arguably cast doubt on the future prospects of <em>Almendarez-Torres, </em>the Supreme Court has not explicitly overruled <em>Almendarez-Torres, </em>and, as a result, we must follow <em>Almendarez-Torres. United States v. Camacho-Ibarquen, </em>410 F.3d 1307, 1316 n. 3 (11th Cir.2005). We note that there is no <em>Booker </em>statutory error because Giddens received a sentence of 180 months\u2019 imprisonment, which was the statutory minimum sentence. District courts are still bound by statutory minimum sentences after <em>Booker. Shelton, </em>400 F.3d at 1333 n. 10. Therefore, even if the district court did apply the guidelines in a mandatory fashion, the error was harmless because the court could not have imposed a lesser sentence due to the statutory minimum. <em>United States v. Raad, </em>406 F.3d 1322, 1323 n. 1 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b73-20\">Finally, because Giddens argues for the first time on appeal that the record is unclear as to what documents the district court used in assessing his prior convictions under ACCA, we review for plain <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>error. <em>United States v. Rodriguez, </em>398 F.3d 1291, 1297 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 2935, 162 L.Ed.2d 866 (2005). We \u201cmay not correct an error the defendant failed to raise in the district court unless there is: (1) error, (2) that is plain, and (3) that affects substantial rights.... Even then, [this Court] will exercise [its] discretion to rectify the error only if it seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1298.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-5\">The Armed Career Criminal Act \u201cmandates a formal categorical approach, looking only to the statutory definitions of the prior offenses, and not to the particular facts underlying those convictions\u201d when applying the sentencing enhancement. <em>Taylor v. United States, </em>495 U.S. 575, 600, 110 S.Ct. 2143, 2159, 109 L.Ed.2d 607 (1990). The Supreme Court held in <em>Shepard </em>that a sentencing court may not rely on police reports or complaint applications in deciding whether a prior conviction was a \u201cgeneric burglary,\u201d in the context of determining whether the conviction is a \u201cviolent felony\u201d under ACCA. <em>Shepard, </em>544 U.S. at 27, 125 S.Ct. at 1263. Instead, when it is impossible to determine from the face of the judgment or statute whether the prior conviction satisfies the enhancement statute, the district court\u2019s review \u201cis limited to the terms of the charging document, the terms of the plea agreement or transcript of colloquy between judge and defendant in which the factual basis for the plea was confirmed by the defendant, or to some comparable judicial record of this information.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b74-6\">Upon review of the record and upon consideration of the parties\u2019 briefs, we find no reversible error. The sentencing court here did not err under <em>Shepard </em>in determining that Giddens\u2019s prior convictions qualified as violent felonies under ACCA. At the sentencing hearing, Giddens\u2019s counsel referred the court to the sentencing transcript from Giddens\u2019s 1997 convictions, which he had submitted to the court with a copy of his pending state habeas corpus petition. The government\u2019s counsel then referenced the indictment and the sentencing document submitted by Giddens\u2019s counsel. In reaching its conclusion regarding the number of Giddens\u2019s prior convictions, the court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b74-8\">But if you look at the overall picture, the colloquy during the plea and the\u2014 and the \u2014 and [the court\u2019s] sentencing and what [the court is] going over and the fact, and the fact that there certainly appear to be separate offenses ... It\u2019s a fair conclusion and a proper conclusion to decide that he is being sentenced for five counts involving burglary and one attempted armed robbery ... And it is clear that these are, as a matter of fact, separate and distinct offenses.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b74-9\">Therefore, the district court did not err under <em>Shepard </em>in assessing the number of prior convictions under ACCA, because the sentencing transcript reveals that the court viewed the plea colloquy, the indictment, and sentencing document, which are all acceptable documents under <em>Shepard. </em>While the court did not state explicitly what documents it viewed in characterizing Giddens\u2019s prior convictions as qualifying offenses under ACCA, the court issued its finding that Giddens qualified as an Armed Career Criminal immediately after its discussion of the number of his prior convictions, which strongly suggests that the court relied upon the same documents submitted by Giddens to characterize the pri- or convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
