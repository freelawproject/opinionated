We affirm the conviction and sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-24\">Because the district court determined Pressley was responsible for 1,428.65 grams of cocaine base and 7,708.75 grams of powder cocaine, Pressley was assigned a base offense level of thirty-eight.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>See </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number><em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 2D1.1(c)(1) (2002). The district court applied a three-level adjustment for acceptance of responsibility, thereby giving Pressley an adjusted offense level of thirty-five. Because Pressley was assessed no criminal history points, he was placed in criminal history category I. The resulting guideline range was 168 to 210 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-5\">As Pressley did not object, the district court adopted the findings in the Presentence Investigation Report. Pressley\u2019s counsel moved the district court for a downward departure, alleging Pressley \u201chas not been in good health his entire life\u201d and must take \u201ca number of medications ... on a daily basis.\u201d The district court determined that \u201c[t]he physical ailments Mr. Pressley has, though they are regrettable, they are not sufficient to warrant downward departure.\u201d Consequently, the court denied the motion for downward departure and sentenced Pressley to imprisonment for 168 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-6\">Pressley filed a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 (2000) motion on February 23, 2004, in which he alleged, among other claims, that his counsel failed to note an appeal after Pressley requested that he do so. In an affidavit filed May 11, 2005, Pressley\u2019s counsel stated that he had \u201cno direct independent recollection of discussing the matter of appeal with Mr. Pressley....\u201d Therefore, the district court granted relief on this claim and, pursuant to <em>United States v. Peak, </em>992 F.2d 39, 42 (4th Cir.1993), vacated Pressley\u2019s judgment of conviction and entered a new judgment from which Pressley could appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-7\">On appeal, counsel filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), questioning whether the magistrate judge fully complied with the requirements of Rule 11 and whether Pressley\u2019s sentence was reasonable. Pressley filed a supplemental brief, contending that the district court improperly enhanced his sentence for drug weights that were neither admitted to nor found by a jury beyond a reasonable doubt, and that the district court erred by entering a new criminal judgment without conducting a new, formal sentencing hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-11\">Because Pressley did not seek to withdraw his guilty plea in the district court, we review any alleged Rule 11 error for plain error. <em>See United States v. Martinez, </em>277 F.3d 517, 524-26 (4th Cir.2002). We \u201cmay notice an error that was not preserved ... only if the defendant can demonstrate (1) that an error occurred, (2) that it was plain error, and (3) that the error was material or affected the defendant\u2019s substantial rights.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 524. We have reviewed the record and find no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-12\">We also reject Pressley\u2019s contention that the district court erred when it enhanced his sentence with drug weights that were neither admitted to nor found by a jury beyond a reasonable doubt. Because Pressley raises this issue for the first time on appeal, review is for plain error. <em>See United States v. Evans, </em>416 F.3d 298, 300 (4th Cir.2005). To establish that a Sixth Amendment error occurred during sentencing, a defendant must show that the district court imposed a sentence exceeding the maximum allowed based only on the facts to which he admitted. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b289-13\">If the district court had sentenced Pressley in accordance with the lowest <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>drug weight to which he admitted, 1.5 kilograms of cocaine base,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> his base offense level would have been thirty-eight. <em>See </em>USSG \u00a7 2Dl.l(c)(l). Based on an offense level of thirty-eight and a criminal history category of I, Pressley\u2019s guideline range would have been 235 to 293 months\u2019 imprisonment. <em>See </em>USSG Ch. 5, Pt. A (2002) (sentencing table). Because Pressley\u2019s sentence of 168 months is below the maximum authorized by the facts to which he admitted, no Sixth Amendment error occurred. <em>See Evans, </em>416 F.3d at 300.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-4\">However, \u201ceven in the absence of a Sixth Amendment violation, the imposition of a sentence under the former mandatory guidelines regime rather than under the advisory regime outlined in <em>Booker </em>is error.\u201d <em>United States v. White, </em>405 F.3d 208, 216-17 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 668, 163 L.Ed.2d 539 (2005). We have declined to presume prejudice, <em>id. </em>at 217-22, and instead have held that the prejudice inquiry is \u201cwhether after pondering all that happened without stripping the erroneous action from the whole, ... the judgment was ... substantially swayed by the error.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 223 (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). Therefore, to make this showing, a defendant must \u201cdemonstrate, based on the record, that the treatment of the guidelines as mandatory caused the district court to impose a longer sentence than it otherwise would have imposed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 224.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-7\">The district court\u2019s 168-month sentence was at the lowest end of the guideline range, as determined by the court. Because the record does not reveal a non-speculative basis for concluding that the district court would have imposed a shorter sentence had it known it possessed discretion to do so, we conclude that Pressley cannot demonstrate that the district court\u2019s plain error in sentencing him under a mandatory guidelines regime affected his substantial rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-12\">We likewise reject Pressley\u2019s argument that a defendant is entitled to a new sentencing hearing when a district court reenters a criminal judgment pursuant to <em>United States v. Peak, </em>992 F.2d 39 (4th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b290-13\">In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the entire record in this case and have found no meritorious issues for appeal. Accordingly we affirm Pressley\u2019s conviction and sentence. This court requires that counsel inform his client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-14\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b288-12\">.
