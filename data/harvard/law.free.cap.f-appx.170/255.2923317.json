See Local Rule 36(c).</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b282-18\">PER CURIAM:</author>\n<p id=\"b282-19\">Darryl Jerome Potts pled guilty to possession of 9.6 grams of cocaine base (crack) with intent to distribute, 21 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 841(a)(1), (b)(1)(B) (West 1999 &amp; Supp.2005), and was sentenced as a career offender to a term of 190 months imprisonment. <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 4B1.1 (2003). Potts seeks to appeal his sentence, arguing that it was imposed in violation of the Sixth Amendment under <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), because the district court relied on facts he did not admit to increase his offense level and to establish his career offender status. He contends that the waiver provision in his plea agreement does not bar his appeal. We find that the waiver was valid and that the issues Potts raises in this appeal are within the scope of the waiver. We therefore dismiss the appeal.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b282-20\">In his plea agreement, Potts waived his right to appeal his sentence \u201con any ground,\u201d except in four circumstances:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b283-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>(1) ineffective assistance of counsel, (2) prosecutorial misconduct not known to the defendant at the time of the defendant\u2019s guilty plea, (3) a sentence in excess of the statutory maximum, and (4) a sentence based on an unconstitutional factor, such as race, religion, national origin or gender.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b283-5\">Potts does not dispute that, during the change of plea hearing, the district court discussed the appeal waiver with him and also informed him that the statutory penalty for his offense was five to forty years imprisonment. A defendant may, in a valid plea agreement, waive the right to appeal. <em>United States v. Wiggins, </em>905 F.2d 51, 53 (4th Cir.1990). Whether a defendant has effectively waived the right to appeal is an issue of law this court reviews de novo. <em>United States v. Marin, </em>961 F.2d 493, 496 (4th Cir.1992). An appeal waiver is valid if the defendant knowingly and intelligently agreed to waive his right to appeal. <em>Blick, </em>408 F.3d at 168-69.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-6\">As discussed above, the district court questioned Potts about the appeal waiver. He stated that he understood it. We conclude that there is no basis for finding that the appeal waiver was not knowingly and intelligently made.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The subsequent issuance of <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), and its progeny does not invalidate an otherwise valid waiver. <em>Blick, </em>408 F.3d at 173.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-7\">In his supplemental brief, Potts argues that the waiver does not bar his appeal because the sentence he received was in excess of the statutory maximum as defined in <em>Booker </em>and was based on an unconstitutional factor; that is, the mandatory application of the sentencing guidelines. He asserts that his plea agreement, unlike the agreement in <em>Blick, </em>did not define the term \u201cstatutory maximum,\u201d and that, as a result, \u201cthe meaning ascribed to the term \u2018statutory maximum\u2019 by the Supreme Court in <em>Booker </em>is the logical one to apply in this case.\u201d He further contends that the waiver excepted a sentence based on an unconstitutional factor, and thus he may raise the alleged Sixth Amendment violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-10\">Because Potts\u2019 career offender offense level was determined by his prior convictions, and the qualifying nature of the predicate convictions was clear from his criminal record, no Sixth Amendment error occurred in Potts\u2019 sentencing. <em>See United States v. Thompson, </em>421 F.3d 278, 282-83 (4th Cir.2005) (holding that district court may impose armed career criminal sentence relying on prior convictions neither charged nor admitted if facts necessary to support enhanced sentence are inherent in fact of convictions and no additional fact finding is required), <em>petition for cert. filed, </em>Oct. 25, 2005 (No. 05-7266). Therefore, we conclude that the waiver exception for a sentence based on an unconstitutional factor does not apply. Moreover, the parties clearly understood the term \u201cstatutory maximum\u201d to refer to the forty-year maximum set out in \u00a7 841(b)(1)(B). <em>See Blick, </em>408 F.3d at 169 n. 7 (agreeing with other circuits that S.Ct.\u2019s use of term \u201cstatutory maximum\u201d in <em>Blakely </em>and <em>Booker </em>does not alter meaning of language in appeal waiver). Consequently, the issues raised in Potts\u2019 appeal are within the scope of his waiver.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-11\">We therefore dismiss the appeal. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-4\">\n<em>DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b282-12\">. Although the government did not assert the waiver in its opening brief, it did so after the parties were directed to submit supplemental briefs following our decision in <em>United States v. Blick, </em>408 F.3d 162 (4th Cir.2005).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b283-8\">. We have reviewed only the portions of the guilty plea hearing transcript that the government quoted in its brief. However, Potts does not dispute the validity of his guilty plea or the waiver.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
