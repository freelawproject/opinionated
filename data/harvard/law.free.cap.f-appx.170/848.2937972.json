Because the Board affirmed under its streamlined process, <em>see 8 </em>C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1(e)(4) (2005), the immigration judge\u2019s decision is the final agency determination. <em>See Camara v. Ashcroft, </em>378 F.3d 361, 366 (4th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b874-22\">Jindjou challenges the immigration judge\u2019s finding that her testimony was not credible, and that she otherwise failed to meet her burden of proof to qualify for asylum. We will reverse this decision only if the evidence \u201cwas so compelling that no reasonable fact finder could fail to find the requisite fear of persecution.\u201d <em>Rusu v. INS, </em>296 F.3d 316, 325 n. 14 (4th Cir.2002) (quotation marks and citations omitted). Credibility determinations of the immigration judge and the Board are entitled to deference as long as they are supported by substantial evidence. <em>See Figeroa v. INS, </em>886 F.2d 76, 78 (4th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b875-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"849\">*849</page-number>We have reviewed the administrative record and the immigration judge\u2019s decision and find that substantial evidence supports the conclusion that Jindjou failed to establish past persecution or the well-founded fear of future persecution necessary to establish eligibility for asylum. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.13(a) (2005) (stating that the burden of proof is on the alien to establish eligibility for asylum); <em>INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 483, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992) (same). Moreover, because Jindjou cannot sustain her burden on the asylum claim, she cannot establish her entitlement to withholding of removal. <em>See Camara, </em>378 F.3d at 367 (\u201cBecause the burden of proof for withholding of removal is higher than for asylum \u2014 even though the facts that must be proved are the same \u2014 an applicant who is ineligible for asylum is necessarily ineligible for withholding of removal under [8 U.S.C.] \u00a7 1231(b)(3).\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b875-5\">We also find that substantial evidence supports the immigration judge\u2019s finding, as affirmed by the Board, that Jindjou fails to meet the standard for relief under the Convention Against Torture. To obtain such relief, an applicant must establish that \u201cit is more likely than not that he or she would be tortured if removed to the proposed country of removal.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.16(c)(2) (2005). Jindjou failed to make the requisite showing before the immigration judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-6\">Accordingly, we deny the petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-7\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
