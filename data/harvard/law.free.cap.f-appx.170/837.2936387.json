Finding no error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-16\">Following a bench trial and the subsequent guilty verdict, Magistrate Judge DiGirolamo sentenced Appellant to two years\u2019 probation, including substance abuse treatment, and 100 hours\u2019 community service. Pursuant to Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 58(g), Appellant appealed to the district court, which affirmed the magistrate judge\u2019s order and judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-17\">On appeal to this court, Appellant argues there was insufficient evidence to support his conviction. More specifically, Appellant maintains the district court should have vacated his conviction because it was predicated on an uncorroborated admission \u2014 Appellant\u2019s statement to United States Parks Police Sergeant Lori Panarello that he knew the vehicle\u2019s registration tags were \u201cnot good\u201d \u2014 in violation of firmly established Supreme Court precedent.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-18\">In reviewing the district court\u2019s affirmance of the magistrate judge\u2019s denial of a motion for judgment of acquittal, this court reviews de novo whether substantial evidence existed, which, taken in the light most favorable to the United States, would permit the trier-of-fact to find the defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>Glasser v. United States, </em>315 U.S. 60, 80, 62 S.Ct. 457, 86 L.Ed. 680 (1942); <em>United States v. Lentz, </em>383 F.3d 191, 199 (4th Cir.2004), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 1828, 161 L.Ed.2d 732 (2005). In making this assessment, this court does not \u201cweigh the evidence or review the credibility of the witnesses.\u201d <em>United States v. Wilson, </em>118 F.3d 228, 234 (4th Cir.1997). Further, we permit the \u201c[G]overnment the benefit of all reasonable infer<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"839\">*839</page-number>enees from the facts proven to those sought to be established.\u201d <em>United States v. Tresvant, </em>677 F.2d 1018, 1021 (4th Cir. 1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b865-5\">Turning to Appellant\u2019s contention, it is well-settled that a defendant\u2019s conviction cannot rest entirely on his uncorroborated extrajudicial confession. <em>Wong Sun v. United States, </em>371 U.S. 471, 488-89, 83 S.Ct. 407, 9 L.Ed.2d 441 (1963); <em>United States v. Hall, </em>396 F.2d 841, 844-45 (4th Cir.1968). In <em>Wong Sun, </em>the Supreme Court clearly stated that \u201cextrinsic proof\u2019 is needed to \u201c \u2018fortif[y] the truth of the confession,\u2019 \u201d but that the corroborative evidence need not \u2018\u201cindependently establish! ] the crime charged....\u2019\u201d 371 U.S. at 489, 83 S.Ct. 407 (quoting <em>Smith v. United States, </em>348 U.S. 147, 156, 75 S.Ct. 194, 99 L.Ed. 192 (1954); <em>see United States v. Norman, </em>415 F.3d 466, 470-71 (5th Cir.2005) (\u201cThe government need not introduce independent evidence on every element of the crime, however. If there is extrinsic evidence tending to corroborate the confession, the confession as a whole is admissible; and some elements of the offense may be proven entirely on the basis of a corroborated confession.\u201d (citation and internal quotation marks omitted)), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 1087, \u2014 L.Ed.2d - (2006). This evidence, which includes circumstantial evidence, must tend to establish the trustworthiness of the confession. <em>Opper v. United States, </em>348 U.S. 84, 93, 75 S.Ct. 158, 99 L.Ed. 101 (1954)</p>\n<p id=\"b865-9\">We find that the Government presented sufficient evidence to support the trustworthiness of Appellant\u2019s admission to Sgt. Panarello about the invalidity of the vehicle\u2019s registration tags. The Government presented credible evidence to prove the vehicle\u2019s registration tags were not legitimate, including Sgt. Panarello\u2019s testimony that the registration tags were fraudulent and a certified record from the Virginia Department of Motor Vehicles, showing it had no record of any registered vehicle with a vehicle identification number (\u201cVIN\u201d) corresponding with the VIN written on the vehicle\u2019s registration tags. Accordingly, as Appellant\u2019s conviction did not improperly rest upon his uncorroborated admission, we find the district court\u2019s ruling affirming the denial of Appellant\u2019s Rule 29 motion was correct. We further find the Government presented sufficient evidence of Appellant\u2019s guilt, and thus we affirm Appellant\u2019s conviction. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b865-11\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
