Adopting the Presentence Report (\u201cPSR\u201d), the district court found that Good qualified as an \u201carmed career criminal\u201d under \u00a7 924(e)(1), meaning that he had at least \u201cthree previous convictions ... for a violent felony or serious drug offense, or both, committed on occasions different from one another.\u201d Armed Career Crimi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"821\">*821</page-number>nal Act (\u201cACCA\u201d), 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(1). The ACCA prescribes a minimum sentence of fifteen years\u2019 imprisonment. The district court, after considering the advisory guidelines range and the factors enumerated in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3558(a), imposed a sentence of twenty-one years\u2019 imprisonment. Good appeals his sentence, arguing that the district court erred in sentencing him as an armed career criminal. Finding no error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-6\">Good was stopped in Greensboro, North Carolina, while driving his girlfriend\u2019s car and, he admits, \u201cprobably speeding.\u201d J.A. 52. After arresting Good for driving without a license and speeding, the officer searched the car and found a loaded .22 caliber revolver under the driver\u2019s side floor mat. A grand jury subsequently indicted Good in the Middle District of North Carolina for possessing a firearm in commerce after a felony conviction, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 922(g)(1) and 924(e). Good stipulated that, on the date he possessed the firearm, he had one prior felony conviction that \u201chad not been expunged or set aside,\u201d namely his 2004 conviction for second degree burglary in North Carolina state court. J.A. 10-11. The federal indictment did not charge, nor did Good stipulate, that he was an armed career criminal under the ACCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-7\">At trial Good admitted to having six prior convictions, including felony convictions for speeding to elude arrest, common law robbery, and second degree burglary. The jury found Good guilty of \u201cthe crime charged in the indictment,\u201d the crime of felon-in-possession. J.A. 95. The jury was never asked to find whether Good qualified as an armed career criminal under the ACCA, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(1), and its corresponding provision in the Sentencing Guidelines, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1, comment (n.l). In calculating the guidelines range, the district court found that Good qualified as an armed career criminal under these provisions, thereby enhancing Good\u2019s base offense level from 24 to 33. A defendant qualifies as an armed career criminal if he has at least \u201cthree previous convictions ... for a violent felony or serious drug offense, or both, committed on occasions different from one another.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(1). Good\u2019s offense level of 33, when combined with his criminal history category of VI, yielded a guidelines range of 235 to 293 months. U.S.S.G. Sentencing Table, Ch. 5, Pt. A. After considering this range as well as the factors enumerated in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), the district court imposed a sentence of 252 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-9\">Prior to sentencing, Good objected to his status as an armed career criminal on two grounds, arguing (1) that he did not have the three predicate convictions for \u201ca violent felony or serious drug offense, or both\u201d and (2) that pursuant to <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), elements of the ACCA must be charged in the indictment and either admitted by the defendant or found by the jury beyond a reasonable doubt. Regarding the first objection, the PSR listed Good\u2019s six adult convictions without identifying which three rendered him an armed career criminal under the ACCA. At the sentencing hearing, the prosecutor clarified that \u201cin [his] understanding\u201d the three predicate convictions were: felonious elude of arrest by motor vehicle (2001); felonious common law robbery (2001); and felonious second degree burglary (2004). The district court agreed. Good, however, objected to the first of these three predicates, eluding arrest by motor vehicle, on the ground that it was not a violent felony for ACCA purposes. Regarding the second objection, Good conceded at the sentencing hearing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"822\">*822</page-number>that \u201cthe recent decision in the Fourth Circuit ... sho[t] [his <em>Blakely </em>] argument in the foot,\u201d no doubt referring to <em>United States v. Cheek, </em>415 F.3d 349 (4th Cir. 2005), but he preserved this issue for appeal. J.A. 97-98.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-4\">Good now appeals his sentence, raising the same two objections to his ACCA enhancement. We review <em>de novo </em>whether a prior conviction qualifies as a predicate conviction under \u00a7 924(e). <em>See United States v. Williams, </em>326 F.3d 535, 537 (4th Cir.2003). We also review <em>de novo </em>whether the enhancement was unconstitutionally imposed as a matter of law. <em>See United States v. Thompson, </em>421 F.3d 278, 280-81 (4th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b848-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-6\">Under the ACCA a \u201cviolent felony\u201d is any crime punishable for a term exceeding one year that \u201c(I) has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another\u201d or \u201c(ii) is burglary, arson, or extortion, involves use of explosives, or otherwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B). \u201cIt is often a question of law whether a [prior] felony meets the statutory definition of a \u2018violent felony\u2019 \u201d because violence is often inherent in the prior crime. <em>Thompson, </em>421 F.3d at 283-84 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Good argues that his prior conviction for eluding arrest by motor vehicle does not qualify as a predicate conviction under the ACCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-7\">This prior conviction satisfies both requirements, however. First, the crime charged is punishable by a prison term exceeding one year even though Good only received a sentence of six to eight months\u2019 imprisonment. For ACCA purposes, lengths of punishment \u201cshall be determined in accordance with the law of the jurisdiction in which the proceedings were held,\u201d in this case North Carolina. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 921(a)(20); <em>see also United States v. Lender, </em>985 F.2d 151, 156 (4th Cir.1993). The relevant question is whether <em>any </em>defendant charged with the crime could receive a sentence of more than one year, not whether Good in particular did or could have; we must consider \u201cthe maximum <em>aggravated </em>sentence that could be imposed for that crime upon a defendant with the worst possible criminal history.\u201d <em>United States v. Harp, </em>406 F.3d 242, 246 (4th Cir.2005) (citing <em>United States v. Jones, </em>195 F.3d 205, 206-08 (4th Cir. 1999)). Under North Carolina law at the time that Good that was convicted (2001), felonious elude of arrest was a class H felony that carried a maximum of thirty months for defendants with prior criminal records. N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 20-141.5 (1997) (speeding to elude arrest); N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 15A-1340.17(d)(1997) (felony sentencing); <em>see also State v. Funchess, </em>141 N.C.App. 302, 309, 540 S.E.2d 435, 439 (2000); <em>State v. Mullaney, </em>129 N.C.App. 506, 508, 500 S.E.2d 112, 114 (1998). The crime thus meets the first requirement for a \u201cviolent felony\u201d under the ACCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-9\">The crime also meets the second requirement. Although it is not among the crimes enumerated in \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)(ii), it satisfies the \u201cotherwise\u201d clause of this provision: the offense in abstract, speeding by car to elude arrest, creates a serious potential risk of injury to others in the car\u2019s path. It is an active crime that poses an obvious risk of injury. <em>Cf. United States v. Hairston, </em>71 F.3d 115, 118 (4th Cir.1995) (holding that felony escape from custody in North Carolina constitutes a violent felony under ACCA given that the \u201csupercharged nature of events surrounding an escape\u201d presents \u201can immediate and substantial risk that the situation will escalate\u201d to one involving physical force and/or injury) (in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"823\">*823</page-number>ternal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b849-5\">Accordingly, we conclude that Good\u2019s prior conviction for felonious elude of arrest qualifies as a predicate conviction under the ACCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-7\">Good also alleges that his ACCA sentence violates his constitutional rights under <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), and succeeding cases, most notably <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). Because Good was sentenced <em>post-Booker, </em>however, he cannot establish constitutional error. Under <em>Booker </em>there is no Sixth Amendment error when a defendant is sentenced under a non-mandatory guidelines scheme. <em>See United States v. Chau, </em>426 F.3d 1318, 1323-24 (11th Cir.2005) (\u201c[T]he use of extra-verdict enhancements in an advisory guidelines system is not unconstitutional\u201d under <em>Booker.) </em>(internal quotation marks and citation omitted); <em>United States v. Martins, </em>413 F.3d 139, 152 (1st Cir.2005) (\u201c[T]he Sixth Amendment [under <em>Booker </em>] is not violated simply because a judge finds sentencing facts under the guidelines; rather, the error is only that the judge did so pursuant to a mandatory guidelines system.\u201d) (citing <em>United States v. Antonakopoulos, </em>399 F.3d 68, 75 (1st Cir.2005)). Pursuant to <em>Booker\u2019 </em>s remedial scheme, the district court here considered the advisory guidelines range as well as the factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) and selected a sentence at the low end of the range that it considered reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-8\"><em>Even if </em>Good had been sentenced under a mandatory guidelines scheme, however, he could not show constitutional error under <em>Blakely </em>or <em>Booker. </em>The Supreme Court has held that prior convictions, more precisely the fact of prior convictions, may be used to enhance sentences even if those convictions have not been found by the jury beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 226-27, 243-44, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). This recidivism exception survives <em>Booker </em>intact. 543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. at 756; <em>see also United States v. Cheek, </em>415 F.3d 349, 352-53 (4th Cir.2005) (\u201cIt is ... clear that the Supreme Court continues to hold that the Sixth Amendment (as well as due process) does not demand that the mere fact of a prior conviction used as a basis for sentencing enhancement be pleaded in an indictment and submitted to a jury for proof beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d). Applying this recidivism exception, we have held that ACCA enhancements are constitutional under <em>Booker. </em>Specifically, we have held that sentencing courts, in addition to considering the fact of prior convictions, can determine as a matter of law whether these convictions meet the statutory definition of a \u201cviolent felony\u201d under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e) and U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1. <em>See Thompson, </em>421 F.3d at 283-87 (finding no Sixth Amendment error when judge, not jury, found that prior convictions were predicates for ACCA enhancement because \u201cfact of prior conviction[s]\u201d includes \u201cessential components\u201d of these convictions, such as date of offense and whether offense meets statutory definition of \u201cviolent felony\u201d); <em>Cheek, </em>415 F.3d at 351-53 (upholding constitutionality of ACCA enhancement). Even if Good had been sentenced under a mandatory guidelines scheme, he could not demonstrate constitutional error.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-10\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-11\">For the foregoing reasons, we affirm Good\u2019s sentence. We dispense with oral <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"824\">*824</page-number>argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court, and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-4\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
