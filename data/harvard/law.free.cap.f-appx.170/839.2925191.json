See Local Rule 36(c).</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b866-18\">PER CURIAM:</author>\n<p id=\"b866-19\">Miguel Ramirez-Arroyo pled guilty to one count of illegal reentry of a deported alien felon, in violation of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(a), (b)(2) (2000). He was found being in the country while serving a state sentence for two drug crimes. The presentence investigation report enhanced his sentencing guidelines offense level based on a prior conviction and used the same conviction to determine the criminal history category. Ramirez-Arroyo contends the district court erred by \u201cdouble counting\u201d his conviction. He further contends the district court erred by believing it did not have discretion under the advisory guidelines to impose a sentence concurrent rather than consecutive to the undischarged state sentence. Finding no error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-20\">Although district courts must now apply the sentencing guidelines as advisory, <em>see United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), courts \u201care not left with unguided and unbounded sentencing discretion. <em>Booker </em>provides that they \u2018must consult those Guidelines and take them into account when sentencing.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Green, </em>436 F.3d 449 454 (4th Cir.2006) (quoting <em>Booker, </em>543 U.S. at -, 125 S.Ct. at 767). We find no error in the calculation of the offense level or the criminal history category. <em>United States v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"841\">*841</page-number><em>Crawford, </em>18 F.3d 1173, 1180-81 (4th Cir. 1994) (using a prior conviction to enhance the offense level and the criminal history category was a proper application of the guidelines). We further find that under the guidelines, it was proper for the district court to impose a consecutive sentence. There is no evidence the district court acted under the assumption that the guidelines were mandatory. In fact, the district court made it clear at sentencing that the guidelines were only advisory. It further listed those additional factors under 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3553(a) (West 2000 &amp; Supp.2005) it used to determine the sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-5\">Accordingly, we affirm the conviction and sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-6\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
