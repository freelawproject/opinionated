Given the BIA\u2019s summary affirmance, the decision on review is the decision of the IJ. <em>See Soadjede v. Ashcroft, </em>324 F.3d 830, 832 (5th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b332-18\">The Attorney General has the discretion to grant asylum to any alien who is a refugee. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158. An alien is considered a \u201crefugee\u201d if he is unable or unwilling to return to his country because he has been subject to past persecution or has a well-founded fear of future persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular group or political opinion. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42)(A). To be eligible for the withholding of removal, an \u201calien must demonstrate a \u2018clear probability\u2019 of persecution upon return.\u201d <em>See Faddoul v. I.N.S., </em>37 F.3d 185, 188 (5th Cir.1994) (citation omitted). This standard requires a higher objective likelihood of persecution than is required to establish eligibility for asylum. <em>Id. </em>Thus, if an alien cannot satisfy the more lenient burden of proof for asylum, he is necessarily precluded from meeting the more stringent burden of proof for the withholding of deportation. <em>See, e.g., Mikhael v. I.N.S., </em>115 F.3d 299, 306 (5th Cir.1997). The CAT requires an alien to show \u201c \u2018that it is more likely than not that he or she would be tortured if removed to the proposed country of re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>moval.\u2019 \u201d <em>Efe v. Ashcroft, </em>293 F.3d 899, 907 (5th Cir.2002)(quoting 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.16(c)(2)).</p>\n<p id=\"b333-5\">Zheng argues that the IJ erred in rejecting his credibility regarding his assertions of past persecution. This court will not substitute its judgment for that of the IJ or BIA with respect to witness credibility. <em>Chun v. I.N.S., </em>40 F.3d 76, 78 (5th Cir.1994). This court reviews an immigration court\u2019s findings regarding credibility to determine if they are supported by substantial evidence in the record. <em>Id. </em>Under substantial evidence review, this court may not reverse the BIA\u2019s factual findings unless the evidence not only supports a contrary conclusion, but compels it. <em>Id.; </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b333-6\">The IJ\u2019s credibility determination was based on substantial evidence in the record. The record shows that Zheng gave inconsistent testimony about the events surrounding the Chinese officials\u2019 alleged demands that Zheng\u2019s wife abort their second child. In addition, Zheng\u2019s wife\u2019s affidavit contradicts Zheng\u2019s testimony concerning those events. The record also shows that Zheng himself gave contradictory testimony about the alleged destruction of his house following his refusal to be sterilized. In sum, the record does not compel a reversal of the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination. <em>See Chun, </em>40 F.3d at 78.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-7\">Zheng argues that he will suffer future persecution if he returns of China. In light of the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination, Zheng cannot meet his burden of proving a well-founded fear of future prosecution. <em>Zhang v. Gonzales, </em>432 F.3d 339, 345 (5th Cir.2005). We note that Zheng does not argue on appeal that he is entitled to asylum based on his wife\u2019s alleged involuntary sterilization. <em>See In re C-Y-Z, </em>21 I. <em>&amp; </em>N. Dec. 915 (1997). Accordingly, any such argument is deemed abandoned. <em>See Soadjede, </em>324 F.3d at 833.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-9\">Zheng has not met his burden of proof with respect to his requests for asylum, the withholding of deportation, or relief under the CAT. <em>See Mikhael, </em>115 F.3d at 306, <em>Efe, </em>293 F.3d at 907. Accordingly, his petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b332-14\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
