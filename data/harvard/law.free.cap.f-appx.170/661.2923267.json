We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-4\">Jimmy A. Bell and Everald F. Thompson are attorneys who represented Gardner in a putative class action suit against the Department of Veteran Affairs. Gardner alleged that Bell and Thompson failed to respond timely to a request for admissions the Department served on Gardner that was due on June 4, 2002. The Department refused a request by Bell and Thompson to extend the time to respond and filed a notice of default of discovery obligation. On September 30, 2002, Bell and Thompson allegedly facilitated a fraud on the court by enlisting a plaintiff to forge the signature of a judge on a motion to extend discovery. On January 3, 2003, the district court granted summary judgment for the Department on the basis of the discovery default and attempted fraud.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-5\">On January 7, 2005, Gardner, a resident of Alabama, filed suit against Bell and Thompson in the Circuit Court of Jefferson County, Alabama, and sought $10,000,000 in damages for legal malpractice. Bell and Thompson, both residents of Maryland, removed the action to federal court and moved for judgment on the pleadings on the ground that Gardner\u2019s claim was time-barred under the Alabama Legal Services Liability Act. <em>See </em>Ala.Code \u00a7 6-5-574(a). The district court granted judgment on the pleadings because Gardner\u2019s claim was time-barred.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-6\">Gardner appeals <em>pro se </em>and argues the district court erroneously concluded that Gardner\u2019s claim of legal malpractice was time-barred and ignored evidence she offered with her pleadings. We liberally construe Gardner\u2019s arguments in deference to her <em>pro se </em>status. <em>See McBride v. Sharpe, </em>25 F.3d 962, 971 (11th Cir.1994). \u2018We review a judgment on the pleadings <em>de novo </em>.... [and] accept the facts alleged in the complaint as true and view them in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.\u201d <em>Cannon v. City of West Palm Beach, </em>250 F.3d 1299, 1301 (11th Cir.2001) (internal citations omitted). \u201cJudgment on the pleadings is appropriate where there are no material facts in dispute and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b688-8\">The district court correctly concluded that Gardner\u2019s claim of legal malpractice was time-barred. Under the Alabama Legal Services Liability Act, claims of legal malpractice \u201cmust be commenced within two years after the act or omission or failure giving rise to the claim, and not afterwards.\u201d Ala.Code \u00a7 6-5-574(a); <em>see Dennis v. Northcutt, </em>887 So.2d 219, 220 (Ala.2004). The Liability Act includes a savings clause that provides, \u201c[I]f the cause of action is not discovered and could not reasonably have been discovered within such period, then the action may be commenced within six; months from the date of such discovery or the date of discovery of facts which would reasonably lead to such discovery, whichever is earlier.\u201d Ala.Code \u00a7 6-5-574(a); <em>see Dennis, </em>887 So.2d at 220.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-9\">Although the district court considered Alabama law unsettled regarding whether to use an \u201coccurrence rule\u201d or \u201cdamage rule\u201d to calculate the period of limitations, Gardner\u2019s claims are time-barred under either rule. The alleged malpractice \u201coccurred\u201d either on June 4, 2002, when Bell and Thompson allegedly failed to respond timely to the request for admissions, or on September 30, 2002, when Bell and Thompson allegedly facilitated a fraud on the court. Gardner was \u201cdamaged\u201d on January 3, 2003, the date the district court granted summary judgment for the Department on the basis of the alleged malpractice. Gardner filed suit on January 7, 2005, more than two years after even the latest of those dates. The savings clause <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"663\">*663</page-number>likewise is inapplicable because Gardner reasonably could have known of either the alleged \u201coccurrences\u201d of legal malpractice or the \u201cdamage\u201d caused by the alleged malpractice within two years.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
