No. 105-100, 111 Stat. 2160, 2193 (1997). Corea contends that the BIA erred in denying his application by finding that the Child Status Protection Act (CSPA), Pub.L. No. 107-208, 116 Stat. 927 (2002) (codified as amended at 8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1151 to 1153; INA \u00a7\u00a7 201, 203 <em>&amp; </em>208), does not apply to applications to adjust under section 202 of NACARA. Corea argues that he belongs to the same class of persons <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"701\">*701</page-number>Congress meant to protect by enacting the CSPA.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-5\">When the BIA issues a decision, we review only that decision, except to the extent that the BIA expressly adopts the IJ\u2019s decision. <em>Al Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1284 (11th Cir.2001). Insofar as the BIA adopts the IJ\u2019s reasoning, as occurred in the present case, we review the IJ\u2019s decision as if it were the BIA\u2019s decision. <em>See id. </em>We review an agency\u2019s statutory interpretation of its laws and regulations <em>de novo </em>but defer to the agency\u2019s interpretation if it is reasonable and does not contradict the clear intent of Congress. <em>See Chevron, U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Res. Def. Council, Inc., </em>467 U.S. 837, 842-46, 104 S.Ct. 2778, 2781-83, 81 L.Ed.2d 694 (1984); <em>see also Barreto-Claro v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>275 F.3d 1334, 1338-39 (11th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b727-6\">The CSPA amended the Immigration and Nationality Act to provide \u201cage-out\u201d protection for persons who were children at the time a petition or application for permanent resident status was filed on their behalf. <em>See </em>Pub.L. No. 107-208, 116 Stat. 927 (2002) (codified as amended at 8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1151 to 1153; INA \u00a7\u00a7 201, 203 <em>&amp; </em>208); <em>see also Padash v. INS, </em>358 F.3d 1161, 1167 (9th Cir.2004). During a June 8, 2004 hearing before the IJ, Corea stated that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b727-7\">I found that [the CSPA] did not apply to NACARA in doing research and it is because they, the Congress in its wisdom found that there would be no need for that because supposedly all NA-CARA cases should have been taken care of on a timely basis and there, as a matter of fact, at the end of NACARA there were children coming into this country who [were] under 21 and immigration did everything they could to make sure that those cases were addressed and therefore this is the reason why Congress did not have the [CSPA] address this matter, however, in this case there has been a ... miscarriage of justice, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b727-9\">The IJ construed this \u201cmiscarriage of justice\u201d argument as a \u201cconstitutional\u201d one. Because Corea conceded to the IJ that the CSPA does not apply to applications for adjustment under section 202 of NACARA and because he makes no constitutional argument on appeal, we do not consider whether the BIA and IJ erred in denying his application on the ground that the CSPA does not apply to applications to adjust under section 202 of NACARA. Moreover, we note that pursuant to 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1(d)(2)(i)(B), the BIA was authorized to summarily dismiss Corea\u2019s appeal because \u201c[t]he only reason for the appeal specified by the party concerned involve[d] a finding of fact or a conclusion of law that was conceded by that party at a prior proceeding.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b727-10\">Corea also urges this Court \u201cto grant his motion to reopen and remand with instructions to terminate proceedings based on the application of equitable estoppel.\u201d Corea did not file a motion to reopen with the BIA. This Court has no jurisdiction to consider a petitioner\u2019s motion to reopen; we may only review for abuse of discretion the BIA\u2019s denial of such a motion and affirm or reverse that decision. See <em>Dakane v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>371 F.3d 771, 773 n. 2 (11th Cir.2004) (\u201cIn this Circuit, we review the BIA\u2019s denial of a motion to reopen removal proceedings for abuse of discretion.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b727-11\">PETITION DISMISSED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
