Pickard argues that his trial counsel was constitutionally ineffective because he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>failed to inform Pickard that he would be ineligible for parole if he was tried and convicted. Pickard claims that if he had known he would not be eligible for parole, he would have accepted the state\u2019s plea offer of ten years imprisonment. Pickard also argues that the district court erred by denying his ineffective assistance of counsel challenge without independently reviewing the trial transcript and motion for a new trial. For the following reasons, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-5\">On appeal, we review the district court\u2019s findings of fact under the clearly erroneous standard, <em>Tinker v. Moore, 255 </em>F.3d 1331, 1332 (11th Cir.2001) (citing <em>Cunningham v. Zant, </em>928 F.2d 1006, 1011 (11th Cir.1991)), and we review questions of law and mixed questions of law and fact <em>de novo, id. </em>at 1332 (citing <em>Jacobs v. Singletary, </em>952 F.2d 1282, 1288 (11th Cir.1992)).</p>\n<p id=\"b113-6\">Section 2254 provides that we may grant a writ of habeas corpus under two circumstances. First, if the state decision was \u201ccontrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States,\u201d or second, if the state decision was \u201cbased on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the State court proceeding.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b113-7\">Pickard\u2019s first claim is that he was denied effective assistance of counsel be-</p>\n<p id=\"b113-10\">cause he was not told that he would be ineligible for parole if he went to trial and was convicted.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We have held that counsel is not constitutionally ineffective by failing to inform a defendant of \u201ccollateral consequences\u201d of a guilty plea. <em>United States v. Campbell, </em>778 F.2d 764, 768 (11th Cir.1985) (holding that \u201ccounsel\u2019s failure to advise the defendant of the collateral consequences of a guilty plea cannot rise to the level of constitutionally ineffective assistance\u201d). In addition, in <em>Holmes v. United States, </em>we held that \u201cparole eligibility is a collateral rather than a direct consequence of a guilty plea.\u201d <em>Holmes v. United States, </em>876 F.2d 1545, 1548-49 (11th Cir.1989); <em>see also Hill v. Lockhart, </em>474 U.S. 52, 54-55, 106 S.Ct. 366, 88 L.Ed.2d 203 (1985). Moreover, we have held previously that a district court\u2019s failure to inform a defendant of potential parole implications does not violate the requirement that a plea be voluntary and an intelligent choice among the alternative courses of action. <em>United States v. Morse, </em>36 F.3d 1070, 1072 (11th Cir.1994) (\u201c[I]t was not a violation <em>of </em>[Fed.R.Crim.P. 11] to fail to advise a defendant of his ineligibility for parole.\u201d (citing <em>Holmes, </em>876 F.2d 1545 (11th Cir.1989))). Because parole eligibility is a collateral consequence of a sentence, trial counsel was not ineffective based on his <em>failure to inform </em>Pickard that he would be ineligible for parole if he went to trial and was convicted.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b114-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>As for Pickard\u2019s second claim, that the district court erred by failing to review the trial transcript and motion for a new trial, we hold that, under the facts of this case, the district court did not err. We have held that \u201c[w]henever any party files a timely and specific objection to a finding of fact by a magistrate, the district court has an obligation to conduct a <em>de novo </em>review of the record with respect to that factual issue.\u201d <em>Stokes v. Singletary, </em>952 F.2d 1567, 1576 (11th Cir.1992) (quoting <em>LoConte v. Dugger, </em>847 F.2d 745, 750 (11th Cir.1988) (internal quotation marks omitted)); <em>see Fillmore v. Perry, </em>163 Fed.Appx. 819, 820 (11th Cir.2006) (citing <em>Wilson v. Cooke, </em>814 F.2d 614, 615 (11th Cir.1987) (holding that district court could not rely on magistrate\u2019s recommendation regarding habeas petition when the magistrate did not meet its obligation to furnish a transcript of the evidentiary hearing that was the basis for the recommendation)); <em>see also </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636(b)(1)(C) (stating that when a party timely files written objections to a magistrate\u2019s proposed findings and recommendations, \u201c[a] judge of the court shall make a <em>de novo </em>determination of those portions of the report or specified proposed findings or recommendations to which objection is made.\u201d). Moreover, \u201can appellate court must be satisfied that a district judge has exercised his non-delegable authority by considering the actual testimony, and not merely by reviewing the magistrate\u2019s report and recommendations.\u201d <em>United States v. Elsoffer, </em>644 F.2d 357, 359 (5th Cir.1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b114-4\">Nonetheless, the district court\u2019s alleged failure to review the transcripts and motion for a new trial in this case does not constitute a reversible error, as there are no facts in dispute. It is clear from the record that trial counsel failed to inform Pickard of his ineligibility for parole. <em>See Pickard v. Thompson, </em>No. 05-CV-64 (CAR), 2005 WL 1522585, at *3 (M.D.Ga. June 24, 2005) (\u201cCounsel did fail to inform petitioner that due to recidivist sentencing he would not be eligible for parole, but, as correctly noted by the Court of Appeals, there is no constitutional requirement that a defendant be advised of such collateral consequences for his decision to reject or accept a plea offer to be valid.\u201d); <em>Pickard v. State, </em>257 Ga.App. 642, 572 S.E.2d 660, 662 (2002) (\u201cThe only information Pickard\u2019s counsel failed to relay was that, due to recidivist sentencing, Pickard would not be eligible for parole.\u201d). As we stated above, however, these facts do not rise to the level of a constitutional violation. Thus, even if we accept as true all the facts set forth by Pickard, the district court did not err by holding that Pickard was not provided with effective assistance of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-7\">Upon a review of the record and upon consideration of the parties\u2019 briefs, we discern no reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b113-8\">. To demonstrate ineffective assistance of counsel under <em>Strickland, v. Washington </em>a petitioner first \"must show that counsel\u2019s performance was [constitutionally] deficient.\u201d <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 687, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984). Second, the petitioner must establish that the deficient performance prejudiced the defense. <em>Id. </em>The Supreme Court has held \"that the two-part <em>[Strickland </em>] test applies to challenges to guilty pleas based on ineffective assistance of counsel.\u201d <em>Hill v. Lockhart, 474 </em>U.S. 52, 58, 106 S.Ct. 366, 88 L.Ed.2d 203 (1985).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b113-12\">. We note that the instant case, where Pickard claims he was <em>not </em>informed of his eligibility of parole, is substantially different than the case where the petitioner claims he <em>was given misinformation </em>about parole. <em>Holmes, </em>876 F.2d at 1552-53 n. 8 (holding that we \"recognize the distinction between failure to inform and giving misinformation,\u201d and stated that \"[e]ven if the Sixth Amendment does not impose on counsel an affirmative obligation to inform clients of the parole consequence of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>their pleas ... other courts have recognized a distinction between failure to inform and giving misinformation.\u201d (citations omitted)); see <em>also United States v. Cadet, </em>138 Fed.Appx. 272, 274 (11th Cir.2005) (\"Counsel\u2019s affirmative misrepresentation in response to a specific inquiry from the defendant may, however, under certain circumstances, constitute ineffective assistance of counsel.\u201d (quoting <em>Campbell, </em>778 F.2d at 768-69)).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
