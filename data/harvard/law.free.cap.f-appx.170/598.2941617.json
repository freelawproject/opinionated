The district court dismissed Davis\u2019s amended complaint <em>sua sponte </em>after determining Davis\u2019s claim was untimely because her EEOC charge was not filed within 300 days of the last discriminatory act, and was therefore frivolous pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(i).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Davis asserts the district court abused its discretion when it dismissed her claim because her case was not untimely. She also seeks recusal of the district judge upon remand. We affirm the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-8\">We review the dismissal \u201cof an <em>informa pauperis </em>action as frivolous under \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(i) for abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>Mitchell v. Brown &amp; Williamson Tobacco Corp., </em>294 F.3d 1309, 1315 (11th Cir.2002). An action \u201cis frivolous if it is without arguable merit either in law or fact.\u201d <em>Bilal v. Driver, </em>251 F.3d 1346, 1349 (11th Cir. 2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b625-9\">As an initial matter, the Polk County Sheriffs Office (Sheriffs Office) contends Davis\u2019s appeal is untimely. A notice of appeal in a civil case must be filed \u201cwithin 30 days after the judgment or order appealed from is entered.\u201d Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(1)(A). If a separate document is required by Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 58(a)(1), then the order is not entered until either the \u201cjudgment or order is set forth on a separate document\u201d or 150 days have passed since the judgment or order was entered in the civil docket. Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(7)(A)(ii).</p>\n<p id=\"b625-12\">The district court\u2019s order of dismissal with prejudice pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B) required a separate document. Since the order was entered on the docket on August 6, 2004, but not set forth on a separate document, it was not entered for the purposes of filing a notice of appeal until January 3, 2005. Davis\u2019s notice of appeal, filed either on January 27 or January 28, 2005, is therefore timely to appeal the district court\u2019s order of dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-13\">Davis\u2019s notice of appeal does not designate any order being appealed as required by Fed. R.App. P. 3(c)(1)(B). Because the requirements of Rule 3 are jurisdictional, <em>Smith v. Barry, </em>502 U.S. 244, 112 S.Ct. 678, 682, 116 L.Ed.2d 678 (1992), we are obligated to review <em>sua sponte </em>whether Davis complied with Fed. R.App. P. 3(c)(1)(B). <em>See Finn v. Prudential-Bache Sec., Inc., </em>821 F.2d 581, 584-85 (11th Cir. 1987). A notice of appeal must \u201cdesignate the judgment, order, or part thereof being appealed.\u201d Fed. R.App. P. 3(c)(1)(B). Failure to abide by this requirement generally precludes us from reviewing any judgment or order not so specified. <em>McDougald v. Jenson, </em>786 F.2d 1465, 1474 (11th Cir.1986). However, we liberally construe this requirement \u201cin favor of the appellant where the intent to appeal an unmentioned or mislabeled ruling is apparent and there is no prejudice to the adverse party.\u201d <em>Campbell v. Wainwright, </em>726 F.2d 702, 704 (11th Cir.1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b625-14\">Davis\u2019s notice of appeal reads, \u201cPlaintiff is filing a NOTICE OF APPEAL to the UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS, ELEVENTH CIRCUIT, AT<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>LANTA, GEORGIA.\u201d Davis\u2019s brief challenges the district court\u2019s finding that her charge was untimely. The Sheriffs Office\u2019s brief addresses the district court\u2019s order of dismissal, contesting the appeal\u2019s timeliness as well as briefing the merits of the issue. Davis evidenced an intent to appeal the dismissal of her amended complaint and the Sheriffs Office has not been prejudiced. Therefore, we have jurisdiction over Davis\u2019s appeal of the order dismissing her amended complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-4\">A prerequisite to bringing suit under Title VII is the timely filing of a charge of discrimination. <em>Maynard v. Pneumatic Prods. Corp., </em>256 F.3d 1259, 1262 (11th Cir.2001). 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2005e-5(e)(1) sets out the amount of time a claimant has to file a charge with the EEOC.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b626-5\">A charge under this section shall be filed within one hundred and eighty days after the alleged unlawful employment practice occurred ... except that in a case of an unlawful employment practice with respect to which the person aggrieved has initially instituted proceedings with a State or local agency with authority to grant or seek relief from such practice or to institute criminal proceedings with respect thereto upon receiving notice thereof, such charge shall be filed by or on behalf of the person aggrieved within three hundred days after the alleged unlawful employment practice occurred, or within thirty days after receiving notice that the State or local agency has terminated the proceedings under the State or local law, whichever is earlier....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b626-6\">\u00a7 2005e-5(e)(1). Since Florida is a deferral state,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> a charge must be filed within 300 days of the last discriminatory act. <em>E.E.O.C. v. Joe\u2019s Stone Crabs, Inc., </em>296 F. 3d 1265, 1271 (11th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b626-10\">Davis alleged the most recent acts of discrimination occurred on or about May 1998, but she did not file charges with the EEOC until May or June 2003. Assuming Davis filed timely charges with the administrative agency, making the longer 300 day period applicable to her case, Davis cannot satisfy the prerequisite of a timely filed charge. Since the district court did not err in concluding that Davis\u2019s EEOC charge was untimely, it did not abuse its discretion in dismissing her amended complaint. Because we affirm the district court, we do not reach the issue of whether the district court judge should be recused.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b625-10\">. Davis also filed a motion to proceed <em>in forma pauperis </em>in the district court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b626-7\">. Deferral states \u201cprohibit the unlawful employment practice at issue and have established state or local authorities to grant or seek relief for such practice.\u201d <em>Maynard, </em>256 F.3d at 1262-63.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
