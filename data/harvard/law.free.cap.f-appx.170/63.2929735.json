Dockery, a white male with a leg impairment, appeals the grant of summary judgment in favor of the Department of Veterans Affairs (\u2018VA\u201d) in his <em>pro se </em>action alleging employment discrimination and hostile work environment, brought under Title VII, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-16; and the Rehabilitation Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 791. On appeal, Dockery, <em>pro se, </em>argues that the district court ignored evidence presented by him in discovery and that the VA was not entitled to summary judgment. We affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-13\">In September 1998, Dockery was hired by the VA as a loan specialist in the home loan office for a one-year probationary period.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In January 1999, Dockery resigned after the VA presented him with a letter proposing his termination. While Dockery was employed at the VA, the office was moving to a new location and as a result employees were involved with moving and assembling furniture. Dockery suffered from severe pain in his upper leg and groin and his doctor provided the VA human resources office with a letter listing certain physical activities that Dockery should not perform.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-14\">He contends that Carolyn Anderson, his supervisor, ignored the severity of his injury by requiring him to move and assemble furniture. He further claims that, contrary to Anderson\u2019s EEOC testimony, furniture assembly continued for more than two weeks and that he had to spend more time than the other employees assembling furniture. In addition, Dockery alleges instances of malicious behavior on Anderson\u2019s part such as: pulling Dockery to the floor by his wrist when he complained about the furniture moving and assembly; and making demeaning statements about his pain. He contends that Anderson, who is of Black and Hispanic descent, subjected him to such treatment in part because of his race.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-15\">Thus, he argues, the district court erred when it found that he did not establish a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number><em>prima facie </em>case for either his hostile work environment claim or his employment discrimination claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-6\">We review a district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment <em>de novo. Patrick v. Floyd Medical Center, </em>201 F.3d 1313, 1315 (11th Cir.2000). We construe the facts and draw all reasonable inferences in the light most favorable to the non-moving party. <em>HCA Health Services of Georgia, Inc. v. Employers Health Ins. Co., </em>240 F.3d 982, 991 (11th Cir.2001). Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c) states that summary judgment is appropriate \u201cif the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c). \u201cA mere \u2018scintilla\u2019 of evidence supporting the opposing party\u2019s position will not suffice; there must be enough of a showing that the jury could reasonably find for that party.\u201d <em>Walker v. Darby, </em>911 F.2d 1573, 1577 (11th Cir.1990). When faced with a \u201cproperly supported motion for summary judgment, [the nonmoving party] must come forward with specific factual evidence, presenting more than mere allegations.\u201d <em>Gargiulo v. G.M. Sales, Inc., </em>131 F.3d 995, 999 (11th Cir.1997).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b91-7\">A. Discrimination</p>\n<p id=\"b91-8\">Title VII makes it an unlawful employment practice for an employer to discharge any individual because of his race. <em>See Bass v. Board of County Com\u2019rs, Orange County, Fla., </em>256 F.3d 1095, 1103 (11th Cir.2001); <em>see also </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-2(a). \u201cIn reverse discrimination suits, plaintiffs must establish ...:[ (]1) that he belongs to a class; (2) that he applied for and was qualified for a job; (3) that he was rejected for the job; and (4) that the job was filled by a minority group member.\u201d <em>Shealy v. City of Albany, </em>89 F.3d 804, 805 (11th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b91-11\">The United States is not an employer within the meaning of the ADA. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12111(5)(B)(i). The United States, therefore, is not a covered entity under the ADA. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12111(2). Accordingly, the Secretary of the VA may not be held liable for a violation of the ADA. The Secretary could, however, be held liable under the Rehabilitation Act. <em>Mullins v. Crowell, </em>228 F.3d 1305, 1313 (11th Cir.2000). We have observed that the Rehabilitation Act expressly adopts the same liability standards as the ADA, and, therefore, whether the Secretary would be liable under the ADA is relevant to Dockery\u2019s Rehabilitation Act claim. <em>See </em>29 U.S.C. \u00a7 791(g); <em>Mullins, </em>228 F.3d at 1313.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-12\">The Supreme Court uses the burden-shifting framework set forth in <em>McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, </em>411 U.S. 792, 93 S.Ct. 1817, 36 L.Ed.2d 668 (1973), to evaluate claims of indirect evidence of discrimination in employment actions. <em>See also Cleveland v. Home Shopping Network, Inc., </em>369 F.3d 1189, 1193 (11th Cir.2004) (applying the <em>McDonnell Douglas </em>burden-shifting test to a disability claim). First, the plaintiff carries the burden of establishing a <em>prima facie </em>case of discrimination. <em>McDonnell Douglas Corp., </em>411 U.S. at 802, 93 S.Ct. at 1824. \u201cOnce a plaintiff <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>has established a <em>prima facie </em>case, the employer then has an opportunity to articulate a legitimate, non-retaliatory reason for the challenged employment action.\u201d <em>Pennington v. City of Huntsville, </em>261 F.3d 1262, 1266 (11th Cir.2001). Once the employer proffers a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason, in order to survive summary judgment, the employee must \u201cproffer sufficient evidence to create a genuine issue of material fact regarding whether each of the defendant employer\u2019s articulated reasons [are] pretextual.\u201d <em>Chapman v. AI Transport, </em>229 F.3d 1012, 1024-25 (11th Cir.2000). \u201cThe ultimate burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that the reason provided by the employer is a pretext for prohibited, retaliatory conduct remains on the plaintiff.\u201d <em>Pennington, </em>261 F.3d at 1266.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-4\">To establish the defendant\u2019s proffered reason is pretextual, the \u201cplaintiff must show \u2018both that the reason was false, and that discrimination was the real reason.\u2019 \u201d <em>St. Mary\u2019s Honor Ctr. v. Hicks, </em>509 U.S. 502, 512 n. 4, 113 S.Ct. 2742, 2750 n. 4, 125 L.Ed.2d 407 (1993). \u201c[T]he factfinder\u2019s rejection of the employer\u2019s legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for its action does not <em>compel </em>judgment for the plaintiff.\u201d <em>Reeves v. Sanderson Plumbing Prod., Inc., </em>530 U.S. 133, 146, 120 S.Ct. 2097, 2108, 147 L.Ed.2d 105 (2000) (emphasis in original). The <em>Reeves </em>court noted that \u201cthe factfinder must believe the plaintiffs explanation of intentional discrimination,\u201d but \u201cit is permissible for the trier of fact to infer the ultimate fact of discrimination from the falsity of the employer\u2019s explanation .... together with the elements of the <em>prima facie </em>case, suffice to show intentional discrimination.\u201d <em>Reeves, </em>530 U.S. at 147, 120 S.Ct. at 2108.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-5\">Upon review of the record, and consideration of the parties\u2019 briefs, we find no reversible error. Even assuming <em>arguendo </em>that Dockery established a <em>prima facie </em>case for either race or disability discrimination, we find that he did not show that the non-discriminatory reason proffered by the VA \u2014 his questionable workplace temperament \u2014 was false.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-7\">We note that while Dockery alleges that Anderson mistreated him to force him to leave the VA, the evidence reveals that she did not ultimately decide to terminate him, and, in fact, merely recommended a reprimand. Instead, Anderson\u2019s superiors decided to terminate his employment because his unprofessional conduct at the workplace. As the record shows, colleagues, veterans and financial institutions all complained to Anderson that he would often behave in an excessively emotional and occasionally aggressive manner toward them. Such behavior persisted even though Anderson had previously admonished Dockery for his conduct. Dockery offers no evidence that this behavior did not occur.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-8\">Therefore, Dockery failed to present or cite to sufficient evidence to show that the VA\u2019s legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for his termination was pretextual, and, accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-9\">B. Hostile Work Environment</p>\n<p id=\"b92-10\">The employee has the burden of proving a hostile work environment. <em>Edwards v. Wallace Cmty. College, </em>49 F.3d 1517, 1521 (11th Cir.1995). To establish a <em>prima facie </em>case for a hostile work environment claim, a plaintiff must demonstrate that: (1) he belongs to a protected group; (2) he has been subjected to unwelcome harassment; (3) the harassment was based on the protected characteristic; (4) the harassment was sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter the terms and conditions of employment and thus create a discriminatorily abusive work environment; and (5) the employer is responsible for that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>environment under a theory of either direct or vicarious liability. <em>Miller v. Kenworth of Dothan, </em>277 F.3d 1269, 1275 (11th Cir.2002). The employee should present concrete evidence in the form of specific facts, not just conclusory allegations and assertions. <em>See Earley v. Champion Internat'l Corp., </em>907 F.2d 1077, 1081 (11th Cir.1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b93-5\">Establishing that the harassing conduct was sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter the terms and conditions of employment has subjective and objective components. <em>Mendoza v. Borden, Inc., </em>195 F.3d 1238, 1246 (11th Cir.1999) <em>(en </em>banc). The employee must personally perceive the harassment as severe or pervasive. <em>Id. </em>Additionally, the environment must be one that a reasonable person in the employee\u2019s position would find hostile or abusive. <em>Id. </em>Four factors are important in analyzing whether harassment objectively altered an employee\u2019s terms or conditions of employment: (1) the frequency of the conduct; (2) the severity of the conduct; (3) whether the conduct was physically threatening or humiliating, or a mere offensive utterance; and (4) whether the conduct unreasonably interfered with the employee\u2019s job performance. <em>Id. </em>Courts must consider the alleged conduct in context and cumulatively, looking at the totality of the circumstances. <em>Id. </em>at 1242. Teasing, offhand comments, and isolated incidents (unless extreme) will not amount to discriminatory changes in the terms and conditions of employment. <em>Id. </em>at 1245.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-6\">Upon review of the record, and consideration of Dockery\u2019s brief, we find no reversible error. As an initial matter, although the district court: (1) assumed, implicitly, that Dockery belonged to a protected group, had been subjected to unwelcome harassment based on a protected characteristic, and that the VA was responsible for his environment; and (2) did not specifically address the <em>Mendoza </em>factors with respect to the severity of Anderson\u2019s conduct, an examination of the record indicates that summary judgment was proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-8\">Evidence supported an inference that: (1) furniture assembly was required, and Dockery spent more time at it than some other employees; (2) Anderson grabbed his arm at one point; (3) Anderson wanted to get rid of him; and (4) Anderson made demeaning comments to him regarding his disability. There is no indication how these occurrences interfered with Dockery\u2019s job performance, if at all. The evidence also makes clear that, on several occasions, Anderson immediately made adjustments to Dockery\u2019s work space to accommodate his leg impairment. Looking at the totality of the circumstances, we find that Dockery\u2019s allegations, even if true, do not meet this Circuit\u2019s standards for establishing the existence of a hostile work environment that was sufficiently severe or persuasive to alter the terms and conditions of plaintiff\u2019s employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-9\">Because Dockery has offered no evidence to suggest that the VA\u2019s proffered reason for his termination is pretextual and because he has not raised a genuine issue of material fact concerning his hostile work environment claim, we affirm the decision of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-10\">AFFIRMED.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b90-10\">. The VA and Dockery dispute whether he was hired on September 27 or 28 of 1998. This factual dispute is immaterial for the purposes of this holding.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b91-9\">. We note that the district court found that Dockery failed to properly cite to evidence in the record to support his position and granted summary judgment, in part, for this reason. Although the VA urges us to affirm for this reason, we decline to do so because it is not necessary in light of Dockery\u2019s failure, in any event, to present evidence sufficient to create a genuine issue of material fact under Rule 56.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b93-12\">. Dockery\u2019s motion to file a reply brief out of time is DENIED.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
