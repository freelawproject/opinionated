Gresh appealed.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We can affirm the District Court on any basis supported in the record. <em>See Fairview Township v. EPA, </em>773 F.2d 517, 524 n.15 (3d Cir.1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b245-17\">On October 15, 2002, a District Justice issued a warrant for Gresh\u2019s arrest for burglary and related charges. That warrant was based on an affidavit of probable cause stating that on October 10, 2002, a named witness observed Gresh leave the victims\u2019 home carrying electronic equip-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>merit and place that equipment into a small black vehicle. The affidavit also stated that the victims had previously indicated to the police that Gresh did not have permission to enter or remove items from the home. Gresh was arrested at a grocery store on October 24, 2002. Incident to the arrest, the police impounded Gresh\u2019s automobile and conducted an inventory search pursuant to police department policies and procedures. Marijuana and drug paraphernalia were found in the trunk. Based on that discovery, the police applied for a second warrant for Gresh\u2019s arrest. A District Justice issued an arrest warrant on October 28, 2002, and Gresh was taken into custody. The burglary and related charges were dismissed following a preliminary hearing on November 27, 2002. On June 5, 2003, the drug charges resulting from the automobile search were dismissed, and Gresh pled guilty to disorderly conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-4\">Gresh alleges that he was arrested without probable cause. Because Gresh was arrested pursuant to a facially valid warrant, to succeed on his \u00a7 1983 claim for false arrest, he must prove that (1) the officers \u201cknowingly and deliberately, or with a reckless disregard for the truth, made false statements or omissions that create a falsehood in applying for a warrant;\u201d and (2) that \u201csuch statements or omissions are material, or necessary, to the finding of probable cause.\u201d <em>Wilson v. Russo, </em>212 F.3d 781, 786-87 (3d Cir.2000) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). If the police lacked probable cause to arrest Gresh, he could also have a claim for false imprisonment. <em>See Groman v. Manalapan, </em>47 F.3d 628, 636 (3d Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b246-5\">According to Gresh, the police officer defendants knowingly made false statements in the warrant applications. In particular, Gresh suggests that the witness whose identification of him was used to support probable cause for the burglary arrest retracted that identification at the preliminary hearing, testifying that \u201cshe observed a person, but not his face, as he exited [the victims\u2019 home].\u201d Importantly, however, there is no indication that the witness equivocated in her initial identification of Gresh, or that the police had any reason to doubt her statement when submitting the arrest warrant application. To the extent that Gresh alleges that he was falsely arrested for the drug offenses, his claim also is without merit. There was probable cause to support the arrest warrant based on a police affidavit describing the drugs and drug paraphernalia found in Gresh\u2019s automobile. Furthermore, because the police had probable cause to arrest Gresh, his malicious prosecution claims must fail. <em>See, e.g., Estate of Smith v. Marasco, </em>318 F.3d 497, 521 (3d Cir.2003) (holding that a malicious prosecution plaintiff must show, inter alia, that the criminal proceeding was initiated without probable cause).</p>\n<p id=\"b246-7\">Gresh also seeks damages for an allegedly illegal search and seizure of his automobile. In order to recover compensatory damages, Gresh must prove, inter alia, that the search and seizure were illegal. <em>See Heck v. Humphrey, </em>512 U.S. 477, 487 n. 7, 114 S.Ct. 2364, 129 L.Ed.2d 383 (1994). The search of Gresh\u2019s car was justified under the automobile exception to the warrant requirement. That exception \u201cpermits law enforcement to seize and search an automobile without a warrant if probable cause exists to believe it contains contraband.\u201d <em>United States v. Burton, </em>288 F.3d 91, 100 (3d Cir.2002). Probable cause exists when, viewing the totality of the circumstances, \u201cthere is a fair probability that contraband or evidence of a crime will be found in a particular place.\u201d <em>Illinois v. Gates, </em>462 U.S. 213, 238, 103 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>S.Ct. 2317, 76 L.Ed.2d 527 (1983); see <em>also U.S. v. Rickus, </em>737 F.2d 360, 367 (3d Cir. 1984) (holding that \u201cobjective facts of this case certainly justified the officers in concluding that there was a fair probability that evidence of a burglary would be found in the car\u201d). The police had probable cause to search Gresh\u2019s car based on a named witness\u2019s statement that she had seen Gresh carry electronic equipment from the burglary victims\u2019 home to his vehicle. <em>Cf. Merkle v. Upper Dublin School District, </em>211 F.3d 782, 790 (3d Cir.2000) (holding that \u201cknowledge of a credible report from a [single] credible eyewitness\u201d can be sufficient to demonstrate probable cause for a warrantless arrest).</p>\n<p id=\"b247-5\"> We agree with the District Court that Gresh has not established claims for \u201cviolations of procedural and substantive due process,\u201d conspiracy, and \u201cpunitive police misconduct/outrageous governmental misconduct.\u201d Gresh failed to elaborate factually or legally on these claims, stating only that he intended to include such causes of action. These conclusory allegations, however, are simply insufficient to state a claim. <em>See Morse v. Lower Merion Sch. Dist., </em>132 F.3d 902, 906 (3d Cir.1997) (stating that \u201ca court need not credit a complaint\u2019s bald assertions or legal conclusions when deciding on a motion to dismiss\u201d) (internal quotations omitted). In addition, we conclude that the District Court acted within its discretion in dismissing without prejudice Gresh\u2019s state-law infliction of emotional distress claim. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1367(c)(3) (providing that a District Court has discretion to decline to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over state law claims if the court \u201chas dismissed all claims over which it has original jurisdiction\u201d); <em>Maio v. Aetna, Inc., </em>221 F.3d 472, 480 n. 6 (3d Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b247-6\">For the foregoing reasons, we conclude that no substantial question is presented by this appeal. <em>See I.O.P. 10.6. </em>Accordingly, we will summarily affirm. For the reasons set forth in footnote 2, Appellees\u2019 motion to dismiss is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-8\">Judge Roth voted to refer to the merits panel.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b245-13\">. The original complaint also named the Berks County District Attorney and several John and Jane Doe defendants. The District Court dismissed as legally frivolous the claims brought against the District Attorney, holding that \"absolute immunity shields prosecutors from liability for damages related to their official acts. <em>Imbler v. Pachtman, </em>424 U.S. 409, 417-19, 96 S.Ct. 984, 47 L.Ed.2d 128 (1976).\u201d The claims against the John and Jane Doe defendants were dismissed without prejudice to their \u201creassertion if, and when, plaintiff can amend his complaint to identify with adequate specificity such defendants and the manner in which each defendant violated his constitutional rights.\u201d Gresh abandoned the latter claims by omitting them from his first amended compliant, and any amendment to his allegations concerning the District Attorney would have been futile.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b245-19\">. Gresh filed his notice of appeal on September 8, 2005. The Appellees filed a motion to dismiss the appeal, arguing that the notice of appeal was untimely filed. See Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(1)(A) (providing 30-day time to appeal final orders in civil actions to which United States is not parly). On October 3, 2005, Gresh filed in the District Court a timely motion to extend the time for filing the notice of appeal. See Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(5). By order entered October 14, 2005, the District Court granted the motion for extension of time and directed Gresh to refile a notice of appeal within 10 days, which he did. Consequently, the Appellees\u2019 motion to dismiss will be denied.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
