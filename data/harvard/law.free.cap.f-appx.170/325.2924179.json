Because Shiimi has withdrawn his motion to proceed <em>in forma, pauperis, </em>Hearne ISD\u2019s motion to oppose the same is moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-19\">2. Shiimi only appeals that part of the magistrate\u2019s order concluding that he failed to make out his prima facie case of race discrimination. \u2018While the fact that one\u2019s replacement is of another national origin \u2018may help to raise an inference of discrimination, it is neither a sufficient nor a necessary condition.\u2019 \u201d <em>Nieto v. L &amp; H Packing Co., </em>108 F.3d 621, 624 n. 7 (5th Cir.1997). The fact that Shiimi was replaced by another person of the same race does not, in and of itself, negate the possibility that Hearne ISD had animus towards people from Namibia or other native Africans. However, Shiimi does not expound on this alleged national origin bias in any way other than his belief that such bias exists.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-22\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b351-20\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
