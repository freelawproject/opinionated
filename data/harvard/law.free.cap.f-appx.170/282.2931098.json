We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-18\">It is undisputed that Kamga\u2019s motion to reconsider was untimely. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1008.2(b)(2) (2004). However, under 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(a) (2004), the Board has authority to reopen or reconsider a case in which it issued a final decision on its own motion at any time. Kamga therefore argues that the Board should have sua sponte exercised its authority under 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(a) (2004) to reopen or reconsider his case. We find that this court is -without jurisdiction to review this claim. <em>See Belay-Gebru v. INS, </em>327 F.3d 998, 1000-01 (10th Cir.2003); <em>Calle-Vujiles v. Ashcroft, </em>320 F.3d 472, 474-75 (3d Cir. 2003); <em>Ekimian v. INS, </em>303 F.3d 1153, 1159 (9th Cir.2002); <em>Luis v. INS, </em>196 F.3d 36, 40-41 (1st Cir.1999); <em>Heckler v. Chaney, </em>470 U.S. 821, 831-33, 105 S.Ct. 1649, 84 L.Ed.2d 714 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b308-21\">Moreover, we have reviewed the administrative record and conclude that Kamga did not exhaust his administrative remedies with respect to this claim because he did not present it on appeal to the Board. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(d)(1) (2000); <em>Asika v. Ashcroft, </em>362 F.3d 264, 267 n. 3 (4th Cir. 2004), <em>cert. denied, </em>543 U.S. 1049, 125 S.Ct. 861, 160 L.Ed.2d 769 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b308-23\">Accordingly, we deny Kamga\u2019s petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-24\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
