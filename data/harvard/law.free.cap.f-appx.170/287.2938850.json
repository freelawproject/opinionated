Gonzales, </em>435 F.3d 475, 481 (4th Cir.2006). The Board ruled that Seid did not warrant the exercise of favorable discretion because she did not assert an error in fact or law in its decision denying reopening of her immigration proceedings. We have reviewed the evidence of record and conclude that the Board did not abuse its discretion in denying the motion. Accordingly, we deny the petition for review for the reasons stated by the Board. <em>See In re: Seid, </em>No. A95898-783 (B.I.A. June 30, 2005). We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-4\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b313-15\"> Insofar as Seid seeks to challenge the Board\u2019s order of April 21, 2005, which denied her petition to reopen immigration proceedings, we are without jurisdiction because Seid failed to file a petition for review of that order within the thirty-day time period. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(1) (2000). This time period is \"jurisdictional in nature\u201d and is not tolled by filing a motion to reconsider with the Board. <em>Stone v. INS, </em>514 U.S. 386, 394, 405, 115 S.Ct. 1537, 131 L.Ed.2d 465 (1995).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
