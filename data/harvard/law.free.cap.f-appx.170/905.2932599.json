He argues that his sentence should be vacated and remanded because the district court sentenced him under a mandatory Sentencing Guideline scheme held unconstitutional in <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). The Government argues that the error was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b932-9\">Under the harmless error standard, the Government bears the burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that the district court would not have sentenced Rodriguez-Orellana differently under an advisory guideline sentencing regime. <em>See United States v. Walters, </em>418 F.3d 461, 464 (5th Cir.2005). The record fails to provide clear commentary from the district court regarding whether it would have imposed the same sentence in a <em>post-Booker </em>environment. <em>See id. </em>The Government thus</p>\n<p id=\"b932-13\">has not carried its burden of showing harmless error. <em>See id. </em>We therefore remand Rodriguez-Orellana\u2019s case for re-sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b932-14\">Rodriguez-Orellana challenges the constitutionality of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b). His constitutional challenge is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). Although Rodriguez-Orellana contends that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>was incorrectly decided and that a majority of the Supreme Court would overrule <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), we have repeatedly rejected such arguments on the basis that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>remains binding. <em>See United States v. Mancia-Perez, </em>331 F.3d 464, 470 (5th Cir.2003). Rodriguez-Orellana properly concedes that his argument is foreclosed in light of <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>and circuit precedent, but he raises it here to preserve it for further review.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b932-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
