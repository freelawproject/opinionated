We previously affirmed Robert Wayne Boggs\u2019s convictions for kidnapping, transmitting a ransom demand, and using a gun in conjunction with the kidnapping. <em>United States v. Boggs, </em>100 Fed.Appx. 188 (4th Cir.2004) (unpublished). The Supreme Court vacated our decision and remanded Boggs\u2019s case for further consideration in light of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). Because we conclude that Boggs\u2019s sentence was enhanced based upon facts not charged in the indictment or admitted by Boggs, we vacate his sentence and remand for further proceedings.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b868-5\">In <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), the Supreme Court applied the rationale of <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), to the federal sentencing guidelines and held that the mandatory guidelines scheme that provided for sentence enhancements based on facts found by the court by a preponderance of the evidence violated the Sixth Amendment. <em>Booker, </em>125 S.Ct. at 746-48, 755- 56 (Stevens, J., opinion of the Court). The Court remedied the constitutional violation by severing and excising the statutory provisions that mandate sentencing and appellate review under the guidelines, thus making the guidelines advisory. <em>Id. </em>at 756- 57 (Breyer, J., opinion of the Court). Subsequently, in <em>United States v. Hughes, </em>401 F.3d 540, 546 (4th Cir.2005), this court held that a sentence that was imposed under the <em>pre-Booker </em>mandatory sentencing scheme and was enhanced based on facts found by the court, not by a jury (or, in a guilty plea case, not admitted to by the defendant), constitutes plain error that affects the defendant\u2019s substantial rights and warrants reversal under <em>Booker </em>when the record does not disclose what discretionary sentence the district court would have imposed under an advisory guidelines scheme. <em>Hughes, </em>401 F.3d at 546-56.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-10\">Because Boggs did not object to the sentencing range of 168 to 210 months\u2019 imprisonment determined by the district court, we review the district court\u2019s guidelines calculation for plain error. <em>United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 732, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993); <em>Hughes, </em>401 F.3d at 547. Under the plain error standard, Boggs must show: (1) there was error; (2) the error was plain; and (3) the error affected his substantial rights. <em>Olano, </em>507 U.S. at 732-34, 113 S.Ct. 1770. Even when these conditions are satisfied, this court may exercise its discretion to notice the error only if the error \u201cseriously affect[s] the fairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 736, 113 S.Ct. 1770 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b868-11\">We have reviewed the record in light of <em>Booker </em>and conclude that two of the enhancements violated Boggs\u2019s Sixth Amendment rights. Boggs received a three-level increase to his offense level for sexual exploitation of the victim, USSG \u00a7 2A4.1(b)(5)(A), and a two-level increase by reference to the guideline for criminal sexual abuse, USSG \u00a7\u00a7 2A4.1(b)(7)(A), 2A3.1. Neither of these enhancements was based on facts proven to a jury or admitted by Boggs. The error was therefore plain, <em>Hughes, </em>401 F.3d at 547-48, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"843\">*843</page-number>because it significantly increased Boggs\u2019s guideline sentencing range, the error affected his substantial rights. <em>Id. </em>at 548. We also conclude that \u201c[t]here can be no doubt that failure to notice such an error would seriously affect the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 555. \u201c[Although it is certainly possible that [Boggs] will receive the same sentence on remand,\u201d the record does not compel that conclusion. <em>Id. </em>at 556.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-5\">Accordingly, while we affirm Boggs\u2019s convictions, we vacate his sentence and remand for resentencing.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-6\">\n<em>AFFIRMED IN PART; VACATED AND REMANDED IN PART</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b868-8\">. Just as we noted in <em>United States </em>v. <em>Hughes, </em>401 F.3d 540, 545 n. 4 (4th Cir.2005), \"[w]e of course offer no criticism, of the district judge, who followed the law and procedure in effect at the time\u201d of Boggs\u2019s sentencing. <em>See generally Johnson v. United States, </em>520 U.S. 461, 468, 117 S.Ct. 1544, 137 L.Ed.2d 718 (1997) (stating that an error is \"plain\" if \"the law at the time of trial was settled and clearly contrary to the law at the time of appeal\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b869-16\">. On remand, the district court must calculate the appropriate guidelines range, consider that range in conjunction with other relevant factors under the guidelines and 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3553(a) (West 2000 &amp; Supp.2005), and impose a sentence. If the district court imposes a sentence outside the guidelines range, the court should state its reasons for doing so. <em>Hughes, </em>401 F.3d at 546.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
