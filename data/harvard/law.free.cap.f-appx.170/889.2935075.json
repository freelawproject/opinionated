The denial of Williamson\u2019s judgment-of-acquittal motion is reviewed <em>de novo. See United States v. </em>Izydore, 167 F.3d 213, 219 (5th Cir.1999); <em>United States v. Payne, </em>99 F.3d 1273, 1278 (5th Cir. 1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b916-8\">Williamson claims the evidence of his dominion and control over the sawed-off shotgun was too tenuous for the jury to convict him of possession because the firearm was not in his truck or, if it was, others had access to the truck.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-9\">To convict based on constructive possession, the Government must present \u201csome evidence supporting at least a plausible inference that the defendant had knowledge of and access to the weapon\u201d. <em>United States v. Mergerson, </em>4 F.3d 337, 349 (5th Cir.1993), <em>cert. denied, </em>510 U.S. 1198, 114 S.Ct. 1310, 127 L.Ed.2d 660 (1994). According to an Officer\u2019s testimony, Williamson asserted ownership of both the truck and an \u201cold shotgun\u201d in it. When the Officer went to the location Williamson had given for his truck (in the woods), the Officer saw the shotgun through the truck\u2019s back window; the firearm was visible between the two front seats. Even if others had access to, or had previously driven, the truck, this is sufficient to support a finding of constructive possession of the shotgun by Williamson. <em>See id. </em>The jury was entitled to credit the Officer\u2019s testimony over testimony by defense witnesses that the firearm was not in the truck but in the woods.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-14\">Williamson also claims there was insufficient evidence to prove he knew the firearm\u2019s barrel was less than 18 inches in length. The Government was required to prove that Williamson knew of the features of his weapon that made it a \u201cfirearm\u201d under \u00a7 5845, specifically, that it was a shotgun having a barrel of less than 18 inches in length or an overall length of less than 26 inches. \u00a7 5845(a); <em>see also United States v. Reyna, </em>130 F.3d 104, 109 (5th Cir.1997), <em>cert. denied, </em>523 U.S. 1033, 118 S.Ct. 1328, 140 L.Ed.2d 489 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b916-15\">The shotgun was in evidence and could be inspected by the jury. Its barrel was 10 inches long and its overall length was only 16 and one-half inches long. Such characteristics would be readily apparent and externally visible. (\u2018When a shotgun\u2019s length is immediately' apparent and externally visible to anyone observing it, the government\u2019s ability to prove knowledge should not be an onerous task.\u201d <em>Reyna, </em>130 F.3d at 109 n. 6.) A rational jury could have concluded that Williamson knew of the characteristics of his weapon that made it a \u201cfirearm\u201d subject to registration under \u00a7 5845(a)(1) and (2). <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b916-16\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b916-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
