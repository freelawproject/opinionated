Calton challenges the evidentiary basis for the jury\u2019s verdict. Cal-ton did not move for judgment as a matter of law prior to or following the entry of the jury verdict as required by Fed.R.Civ.P. 50(a) and (b). His failure to comply with Rule 50 forecloses his challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence on appeal. <em>See Unitherm Food Sys., Inc. v. Swift-Eckrich, Inc., </em>\u2014 U.S. -, -, 126 S.Ct. 980, 987, 163 L.Ed.2d 974, - (2006). Because Calton made no Rule 50 motion in district court, \u201cthere [i]s no basis for review of [his] sufficiency of the evidence challenge in the Court of Appeals.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 989.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-24\">Calton next argues that the district court improperly assessed costs against him because he is indigent. Title 28, Section 1915 provides that when a party proceeds IFP \u201cjudgment may be rendered for costs at the conclusion of the suit or action as in other cases.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(f)(1). We conclude that Calton fails to show the assessment of costs was erroneous simply because he was proceeding IFP. <em>See Washington v. Patlis, </em>916 F.2d 1036, 1039-40 (5th Cir.1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b364-25\">Finally, Calton argues that the defendants are not entitled to an award of attorneys\u2019 fees. At the time the parties filed their appellate briefs a defense motion for attorneys\u2019 fees was pending in the district court. The district court has since denied the motion, however, and Calton\u2019s argument is moot. <em>See Hams v. City of Houston, </em>151 F.3d 186, 189 (5th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b364-26\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b364-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
