The plea agreement stipulated to a drug quantity of 1,030.7 grams of cocaine and 17.8 grams of cocaine base. At sentencing, the district court found Jefferson responsible for 2,561.6 grams of cocaine. Jefferson objected to that drug quantity. The district court denied Jefferson\u2019s objections and sentenced him to 130 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-24\">On appeal, Jefferson asserts that he is entitled to resentencing because the Government breached the plea agreement.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> In response, the Government has eommendably moved for remand, conceding that it undermined the plea agreement\u2019s stipulation as to drug quantity by making comments that could be construed as suggesting that a greater drug quantity finding than that set forth in the plea agreement would be appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-25\">Jefferson does not oppose a remand for the purpose of resentencing. We grant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>the Government\u2019s motion to remand. \u201cWe remand the ease to a different district judge for resentencing as we are required to do.\u201d <em>United States v. Peglera, </em>33 F.3d 412, 413, 415 (4th Cir.1994) (citing <em>Santobello v. New York, </em>404 U.S. 257, 263, 92 S.Ct. 495, 30 L.Ed.2d 427 (1971)). Therefore, we affirm Jefferson\u2019s conviction, vacate the sentence imposed by the district court, and remand for reconsideration of the sentence by a different judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-4\">\n<em>AFFIRMED IN PART, VACATED IN PART, AND REMANDED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b305-26\"> Jefferson does not challenge his guilty plea or otherwise attack the integrity of his convictions.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
