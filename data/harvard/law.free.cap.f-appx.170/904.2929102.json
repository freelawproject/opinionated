Ferrell appeals his conviction following a jury trial for making a false statement to a financial institution and wire fraud. Ferrell argues for the first time on appeal that he was denied a fair trial by the prosecutor\u2019s mischaracterization of certain testimony; he also argues that the district court\u2019s subsequent refusal to re-instruct the jury was error. We find no error, plain or otherwise, because the transcript shows that the prosecutor did not miseharacterize the testimony. <em>See United States v. Cotton, </em>535 U.S. 625, 631, 122 S.Ct. 1781, 152 L.Ed.2d 860 (2002); <em>United States v. Montgomery, </em>210 F.3d 446, 454-55 (5th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b931-10\">We also reject Ferrell\u2019s assertion that there was insufficient evidence to support the jury\u2019s finding of fraudulent intent. Ferrell complains that the testimony against him was not trustworthy. However, the credibility of witnesses is a matter for the jury. <em>See United States v. Rodriguez, 278 </em>F.3d 486, 490 (5th Cir.2002). Ferrell has failed to show that a reasonable juror could not have found him guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>See United </em>States <em>v. Bell, </em>678 F.2d 547, 549 (5th Cir. 1982)(en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b931-15\">Finally, we find that the district court did not err in denying Ferrell\u2019s motion for a new trial. Ferrell asserts that he should receive a new trial because the district court did not re-instruct the jury that the prosecutor\u2019s statements were not evidence and because there was insufficient evidence to prove his fraudulent intent. Ferrell has not shown that the jury\u2019s verdict was against the great weight of the evidence such that it would be a serious miscarriage of justice to let it stand. <em>See United States v. Robertson, </em>110 F.3d 1113, 1118 (5th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b931-16\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b931-11\"> Pursuant <em>to 5th Cir.
