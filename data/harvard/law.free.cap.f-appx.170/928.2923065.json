Spence\u2019s IFP motion is construed as a challenge to the district court\u2019s certification that his appeal is not taken in good faith. <em>Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b956-5\">Our inquiry into Spence\u2019s good faith is limited to the district court\u2019s reasons for the certification; we consider the IFP motion to determine \u201cwhether the appeal involves legal points arguable on their merits (and therefore not frivolous).\u201d <em>Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 220 (5th Cir.1983) (internal quotations and citations omitted); <em>Baugh, </em>117 F.3d at 202.</p>\n<p id=\"b956-6\">Spence asserts that the defendants are not entitled to qualified immunity and that the district court erred by sua sponte invoking the qualified immunity defense and by dismissing his complaint on summary judgment without notice, prior to discovery, and without affording him an opportunity to amend. Spence\u2019s complaint was dismissed for failure to state a claim; we review such dismissals de novo. <em>Clay v. Allen, </em>242 F.3d 679, 680 (5th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b956-7\">Spence does not refute the district court\u2019s conclusions that the defendants were entitled to absolute judicial, prosecutorial, and quasi-judicial immunity, nor does he demonstrate that he alleged the violation of a constitutional right against the Board of Supervisors. Accordingly, Spence has not shown that his appeal involves \u201clegal points arguable on their merits.\u201d <em>Howard, </em>707 F.2d at 220; <em>see </em>Fed. R.App. P. 28(a)(9)(A); <em>Grant v. Cuellar, </em>59 F.3d 523, 524 (5th Cir.1995); <em>Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 225 (5th Cir.1993). Spence\u2019s motion for leave to proceed IFP is denied. <em>See Baugh, </em>117 F.3d at 202.</p>\n<p id=\"b956-10\">Because the merits of Spence\u2019s appeal are \u201cinextricably intertwined with the certification decision,\u201d we may examine the issue whether Spence\u2019s appeal should be dismissed. <em>See Baugh, </em>117 F.3d at 202. Spence\u2019s pro se status entitles him to a liberal interpretation of his arguments. <em>Haines v. Kerner, </em>404 U.S. 519, 520, 92 S.Ct. 594, 30 L.Ed.2d 652 (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b956-11\">Spence\u2019s allegations that he was denied an appeal, counsel, IFP status, and transcripts in criminal proceedings, if proven, would implicate the validity of his conviction. These claims are not cognizable under \u00a7 1983 because Spence has not established that the validity of his conviction has been cast into doubt. <em>See Krueger v. Reimer, </em>66 F.3d 75, 77 (5th Cir.1995) (citing <em>Heck v. Humphrey, </em>512 U.S. 477, 486-87, 114 S.Ct. 2364, 129 L.Ed.2d 383 (1994)).</p>\n<p id=\"b956-12\">Spence\u2019s allegations that the state judges denied his out-of-time criminal appeal and his motions for leave to proceed IFP, for appointment of counsel, and for documents at government expense concern judicial functions, which are protected by the doctrine of absolute judicial immunity. <em>Boyd v. Biggers, </em>31 F.3d 279, 284 (5th Cir.1994); <em>Krueger, </em>66 F.3d at 76-77. Likewise, the former district attorney is entitled to prosecutorial immunity because the \u00a7 1983 allegations concerned his role as a State advocate. <em>See id. </em>at 77.</p>\n<p id=\"b956-13\">The remaining individual defendants are entitled to qualified immunity from \u00a7 1983 liability for the routine duties <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"931\">*931</page-number>of which Spence complained. <em>See Clay, </em>242 F.3d at 682. Spence, however, must demonstrate a violation of his constitutional rights. <em>Allison v. Kyle, </em>66 F.3d 71, 73 (5th Cir.1995). Spence cannot establish a violation of his right of access to the court because he has not alleged an actual injury. <em>See Lewis v. Casey, 518 U.S. 343, 349, </em>116 S.Ct. 2174, 135 L.Ed.2d 606 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b957-5\">Spence cannot make the showing required to establish that the Board of Supervisors violated his constitutional rights. <em>See Bennett v. City of Slidell, </em>728 F.2d 762, 767 (5th Cir.1984) (en banc). Spence\u2019s conclusional allegations of a conspiracy are not sufficient to support a claim under \u00a7 1983. <em>See Wilson v. Budney, </em>976 F.2d 957, 958 (5th Cir.1992). In addition, Spence\u2019s conclusional allegations do not establish liability on the part of the defendants in their individual capacities. <em>See Oliver v. Scott, </em>276 F.3d 736, 741 (5th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b957-6\">Spence\u2019s appeal has no arguable merit, is frivolous, and is dismissed. 5th Cir. R. 42.2; <em>see Howard, </em>707 F.2d at 219-20. The dismissal by the district court of Spence\u2019s complaint and the dismissal of this appeal as frivolous each count as a strike under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). <em>Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 385-87 (5th Cir.1996). Spence is cautioned that if he accumulates three strikes under \u00a7 1915(g), he will not be allowed to proceed IFP in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. \u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b957-7\">IFP DENIED; APPEAL DISMISSED AS FRIVOLOUS; SANCTION WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b956-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
