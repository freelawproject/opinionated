R.Crim. P 85 motion for a reduction of his sentence based on cooperation that he provided in connection with a drug-trafficking prosecution. Although the Government\u2019s pleadings in the district court indicate that the Government agreed to file a Rule 35 motion if Gutierrez provided substantial assistance and that Gutierrez provided such assistance, Gutierrez is not entitled to relief for the following reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-23\">First, the requested relief falls within the ambit of a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion. <em>See Reyes-Requena v. United States, </em>243 F.3d 893, 903 (5th Cir.2001); <em>United States v. Cates, </em>952 F.2d 149, 151 (5th Cir.1992). As Gutierrez previously filed a \u00a7 2255 motion seeking the same relief, he was required to seek leave from this court prior to filing a second or successive post-conviction motion. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2244(b)(3), 2255. As he did not do so, the district court was without jurisdiction to entertain his motion. <em>See United States v. Key, </em>205 F.3d 773, 774 (5th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b367-24\">Second, even if we were to construe Gutierrez\u2019s mandamus petition as seeking leave from this court to file a second or successive \u00a7 2255 motion, we would not grant it because Gutierrez\u2019s claims do not rely on either newly-discovered evidence that would be sufficient to establish by clear and convincing evidence that no reasonable factfinder would have found the movant guilty, or a new rule of constitutional law, made retroactive to cases on collateral review by the Supreme Court, that was previously unavailable. <em>See </em>\u00a7 2255; <em>Reyes-Requena, </em>243 F.3d at 897-99.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-25\">Finally, even if a petition for writ of mandamus were the appropriate vehicle for Gutierrez\u2019s claims, the district court did not err in denying him relief. Gutierrez had other avenues of seeking relief that he failed to pursue in a timely manner, and he failed to appeal any prior rulings. Given these facts and the passage of time between his conviction and this third attempt by Gutierrez to seek the same relief, the district court properly exercised its discretion in concluding that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>Gutierrez\u2019s petition for a writ of mandamus was not appropriate under the circumstances. <em>See United States v. Williams, </em>400 F.3d 277, 280-81 (5th Cir. 2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b368-4\">For all the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b367-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
