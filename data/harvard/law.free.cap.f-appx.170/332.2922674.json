United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). Although Araguz contends that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>was incorrectly decided and that a majority of the Supreme Court would overrule <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), we have repeatedly rejected such arguments on the basis that <em>AlmendarezTorres </em>remains binding. <em>See United States v. Garza-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d 268, 276 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 298, 163 L.Ed.2d 260 (2005). Araguz properly concedes that his argument is foreclosed in light of <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>and circuit precedent, but he raises it here to preserve it for further review. Thus, we AFFIRM Araguz\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-13\">Araguz contends that his sentence must be vacated because he was sentenced pursuant to the mandatory sentencing guidelines regime that was held to be unconstitutional in <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). The sentencing transcript is devoid of evidence that the district court would have imposed the same sentence under an advisory regime, and, therefore, the Government has not met its burden of establishing beyond a reasonable doubt that the district court\u2019s error was harmless. <em>See United States v. Walters, </em>418 F.3d 461, 464 (5th Cir.2005). Accordingly, Araguz\u2019s sentence is VACATED, and the case is REMANDED for further proceedings. <em>See id. </em>at 466.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b358-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b359-20\">. We reject the government\u2019s contention that the waiver of appeal provision in Araguz's plea agreement bars this appeal. At rearraignment, the magistrate judge, in the context of addressing the waiver of appeal provision, specifically advised Araguz that he \"could still appeal from an illegal sentence.\u201d Under such circumstances, the appeal waiver was not knowing and voluntary. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Cuellar, </em>151 Fed. Appx. 352, 353, 2005 WL 2769527 (5th Cir.2005) (unpublished); <em>United States v. Mendez, </em>153 Fed. Appx. 917, 918, 2005 WL 2404755 (5th Cir. 2005) (unpublished).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
