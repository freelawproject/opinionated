Again proceeding <em>pro se </em>on appeal, he is challenging the tax court\u2019s grant of the Commissioner of Internal Revenue\u2019s (\u201cthe Commissioner\u2019s\u201d) motion to dismiss his petition for review for failure to prosecute. For the reasons set forth more fully below, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-14\">Prior to Wrubleski filing the instant petition for review, he reported \u201czero\u201d income tax due on tax returns he filed for 1998, 1999, and 2000. Because Wrubleski\u2019s tax liabilities, instead, were $28,354 for tax year 1998, $10,618 for tax year 1999, and $10,211 for tax year 2000, the Commissioner sent to Wrubleski by certified mail notices of deficiencies for these years, pursuant to 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6212(a). After Wrubleski failed to petition the tax court for review of these asserted deficiencies within the 90-day period permitted under 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6213(a), the Commissioner assessed these deficiency amounts and mailed to Wrubleski a notice and demand for payment. Moreover, after Wrubleski failed to pay these assessed amounts, the Commissioner mailed to him a final notice, pursuant to 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6330(d), informing him of (1) the Commissioner\u2019s intent to levy Wrubleski\u2019s property, and (2) Wrubleski\u2019s right to a CDP hearing.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b618-17\">Wrubleski subsequently requested a CDP hearing, arguing that he was not liable for any income tax because (1) his wages were not taxable as income, (2) no tax had been assessed against him, and (3) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>the Commissioner lacked authority either to assess income taxes or to levy his property. The Appeals Office sent Wrubleski a letter advising him that, because his arguments were frivolous, he was not entitled to a face-to-face conference. The Appeals Office also attached to this letter transcripts of Wrubleski\u2019s accounts for tax years 1998 through 2000. After electing to have his CDP hearing conducted through correspondence, Wrubleski again raised multiple constitutional challenges to the federal income tax and to the Commissioner\u2019s general authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-5\">In February 2004, the Appeals Office issued a notice of determination, sustaining the proposed levy. The Appeals Office explained that Wrubleski was barred, pursuant to 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6330(c)(2)(B), from challenging either the existence, or the amount, of his tax liabilities for tax years 1998 through 2000, because he admitted that he had received notices of the deficiencies, and he had failed to timely petition the tax court for their redetermination. The Appeals Office also explained that an officer had verified that the deficiency assessments were valid and unpaid, and that applicable laws and administrative procedures had been followed. In addition, it discussed that Wrubleski neither had proposed a \u201cvalid collection alternative,\u201d nor \u201can acceptable, less intrusive method of payment.\u201d The Appeals Office concluded that the proposed levy balanced \u201cthe need for the efficient collection of taxes and [Wrubleski\u2019s] legitimate concern that any collection action be no more intrusive than necessary.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b619-6\">On March 3, 2004, Wrubleski filed the instant petition, arguing that the Appeals Office\u2019s determination was \u201clawless and erroneous\u201d because the Commissioner failed to provide him with, or to attach to the determination, (1) a \u201cSummary Record of Assessment\u201d that supported the levy, as required by Treas. Reg. \u00a7 301.6203-1; (2) a \u201cnotice and demand for payment,\u201d as required by 26 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 6303, 6321, and 6331; (3) a \u201cvalid notice of deficiency in connection with any of the years at issue\u201d; and (4) verification from the Secretary of the Treasury \u201cthat the requirements of any applicable law or administrative procedure ha[d] been met,\u201d pursuant to 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6330(c)(1). Wrubleski also contended that he was challenging the existence of the underlying tax liability, and that this challenge was authorized because he did not receive any statutory notice of the deficiencies for the relevant years. As relief, Wrubleski sought (1) a declaration that the Appeals Office\u2019s determination was invalid; (2) an order directing the Appeals Office to conduct a proper CDP hearing and to have available at this hearing all \u201crelevant documents\u201d; and (3) an order directing the Commissioner to reimburse Wrubleski for his costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-8\">In June 2004, the Commissioner filed an answer to Wrubleski\u2019s petition, arguing that the Appeals Office\u2019s determination should be sustained. In July'2004, the tax court issued (1) a standing pretrial order, and (2) a notice setting Wrubleski\u2019s trial date as December 6, 2004. In its pretrial order, the tax court instructed the parties that \u201call parties shall be prepared for trial,\u201d and that \u201c[t]he [e]ourt may impose appropriate sanctions, including dismissal, for any unexcused failure to comply with this Order.\u201d Moreover, in its notice of the trial date, the tax court warned the parties:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b619-9\">[B]oth parties are expected to be present at that time and be prepared to try the case. YOUR FAILURE TO APPEAR MAY RESULT IN DISMISSAL OF THE CASE AND ENTRY OF DECISION AGAINST YOU.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b619-10\">The Commissioner subsequently moved for summary judgment, arguing that no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>genuine issue of material fact existed. Wrubleski responded that the officer who had conducted his CDP hearing had not satisfied the verification requirement in 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6330(c)(1), because (1) \u201c[n]ot one of the documents provided ... came from the office of the Secretary,\u201d and (2) the Commissioner had not provided him with \u201cthe unbroken chain of delegation and re-delegation orders from the Secretary to the Revenue Agent level and Appeals Officer level of the IRS.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Wrubleski also filed a motion to compel the Commissioner to produce multiple documents, including (1) proof that the notices of deficiencies and other statutory notices and demands had been mailed to him; (2) proof that he had received these documents; (3) a document stating that the Secretary of the Treasury had authorized an action for the collection of taxes and penalties; and (4) a signed document by the Secretary that all applicable laws and regulations had been followed. The Commissioner replied that the Secretary was not required to verify personally that all such requirements were met.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-4\">On November 1, 2004, Wrubleski filed a document labeled \u201cpraecipe for judicial notice of pending settlement and petition for stay,\u201d in which he referred to a \u201csettlement pending between the parties\u201d and requested that the tax court stay the proceeding during the \u201cpendency of the settlement.\u201d <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Wrubleski included in this document that he intended \u201cto pay all debts validated, i.e., verified and substantiated, as being owed\u201d by him. Construing this motion as a motion to continue the trial date, the tax court denied it. On November 22, 2004, the tax court also denied the Commissioner\u2019s motion for summary judgment and directed the Commissioner to provide Wrubleski with the documents he requested in his motion to compel.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-8\">On December 6, 2004, the tax court called the case for trial, both in the morning and the afternoon. Wrubleski failed to appear at either time. The Commissioner then moved to dismiss the petition for failure to prosecute, explaining that (1) no issues existed on which the Commissioner bore the burden of proof, and (2) Wrubleski had failed to appear after being informed of the trial date. The tax court summarily granted the Commissioner\u2019s motion and ordered the levy of Wrubleski\u2019s property.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-9\">Wrubleski argues on appeal that the tax court either abused its discretion, or clearly erred, by refusing to accept for filing \u201call evidence Wrubleski attempted to file after November 1, 2004.\u201d Wrubleski as<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>serts in support that (1) the court\u2019s refusal to accept Wrubleski\u2019s evidence was \u201ctantamount to the denial of due process\u201d; and (2) this refusal \u201cundermine[d] confidence in the outcome of the proceedings in this Case to an unacceptable degree.\u201d Wrubleski asserts that the Appeals Office refused to provide, or even identify, each and every document requested by him. Wrubleski also argues that the court erred in dismissing the petition in light of the fact that the parties had a settlement agreement, which the Commissioner, at least implicitly, had ratified by (1) not avoiding it, (2) using Wrubleski\u2019s \u201ctrademark,\u201d and (8) refusing tender of payment.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b621-5\">As a preliminary matter, to the extent Wrubleski is arguing in reply that the tax court erred in dismissing his petition because the Appeals Office improperly denied his constitutional challenges to his levy, he failed to raise this argument in his initial brief. We, therefore, deem this argument abandoned. <em>See Access Now, Inc. v. Southwest Airlines Co., </em>385 F.3d 1324, 1330 (11th Cir.2004) (issues not argued in initial brief are deemed abandoned). Regardless, we repeatedly have rejected these \u201ctax protest\u201d type arguments. <em>See Biermann v. C.I.R., </em>769 F.2d 707, 708 (11th Cir.1985). Thus, even if Wrubleski had properly raised this argument, it is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-6\">Pursuant to 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7453, the Tax Court has promulgated rules of practice and procedure governing the conduct of proceedings in that court. <em>See </em>26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7453. Under Rule 123(b) of the Tax Court Rules of Practice and Procedure:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A3c\">For failure of a petitioner properly to prosecute or to comply with these Rules or any order of the Court or for other cause which the Court deems sufficient, the Court may dismiss a case at any time and enter a decision against the petitioner. The Court may, for similar reasons, decide against any party any issue as to which such party has the burden of proof, and such decision shall be treated as a dismissal.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b621-9\">26 U.S.C. foil. \u00a7 7453, Tax Court Rule 123(b). Moreover, \u201ca decision rendered ... in consequence of a dismissal, other than a dismissal for lack of jurisdiction, shall operate as an adjudication on the merits.\u201d <em>Id., </em>Tax Court Rule 123(d). We review a tax court\u2019s dismissal for failure to properly prosecute, pursuant to Rule 123(b), for abuse of discretion. <em>Crandall v. C.I.R., </em>650 F.2d 659, 660 (5th Cir. Unit B July 13, 1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b621-10\">In explaining this abuse-of-diseretion standard, the former Fifth Circuit discussed in <em>Crandall </em>that standards governing Fed.R.Civ.P. 41 \u2014 the rule applicable when a party fails to prosecute his case, comply with a court order, or follow the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure in a district court \u2014 similarly should govern dismissals by the tax court. <em>Id. </em>\u201cDismissal under Rule 41(b) is appropriate where there is a clear record of 'willful\u2019 contempt and an implicit or explicit finding that lesser sanctions would not suffice.\u201d <em>Gratton v. Great American Communications, </em>178 F.3d 1373, 1374 (11th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b621-11\">In <em>Crandall, </em>the former Fifth Circuit reviewed a tax court\u2019s dismissal of a taxpayer\u2019s appeal of a tax deficiency, which dismissal was based on the taxpayer\u2019s failure to file a timely petition and filing fee. <em>See Crandall, </em>650 F.2d at 659. The <em>Crandall </em>Court noted that (1) \u201cno history of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>delay or contumacious conduct by the appellant\u201d existed; (2) the tax court had dismissed the case after only three months of inactivity by the taxpayer; (3) the taxpayer had not repeatedly failed to comply with the tax court\u2019s orders; (4) the tax court had not repeatedly warned the taxpayer that he was risking dismissal; and (5) on appeal, the taxpayer had offered a reason for his failure to comply the tax court\u2019s order. <em>See id. </em>at 660. The <em>Crandall </em>Court determined that, under these circumstances, the tax court\u2019s dismissal of the appellant\u2019s case was premature. <em>See id. </em>The court, therefore, remanded the case to allow the taxpayer to present evidence of his excuse, and for the tax court to make findings as to whether dismissal was justified. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b622-4\">On the other hand, in <em>Freedson v. C.I.R., </em>565 F.2d 954 (5th Cir.1978), the former Fifth Circuit affirmed a tax court\u2019s dismissal of a petition relating to a protest of assessments of deficiencies and additional taxes, when the dismissal was based on the taxpayers\u2019 unpreparedness to present their case at their trial date. <em>See id. </em>at 954. The <em>Freedson </em>Court explained that (1) the case had been pending for a sufficient length of time to enable the taxpayers to prepare their case, (2) the taxpayers already had obtained three continuances of their trial date, and (3) the court had warned the taxpayers two and one-half years before their case was dismissed that the court would look unfavorably upon further requests for continuances. <em>See id. </em>at 955. The <em>Freedson </em>Court also noted that the taxpayers had been uncooperative in providing the Commissioner with information necessary for the trial, and that the tax court had considered possible lesser sanctions and found them inappropriate. <em>See id. </em>Although the <em>Freedson </em>Court acknowledged that dismissal of an action is \u201ca severe sanction,\u201d it concluded that dismissal was not excessive under the circumstances. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b622-6\">In the instant case, Wrubleski filed his petition in the tax court nine months before his scheduled trial date. The tax court warned Wrubleski in both its pretrial order and its notice of trial that his unexcused failure to appear and be ready for trial on his schedule trial date might result in appropriate sanctions, including dismissal. Moreover, Wrubleski neither explained in the tax court, nor on appeal, why he did not appear at his scheduled trial date, or why he could not have presented evidence at that time. Although Wrubleski filed a pretrial document labeled \u201cpraecipe for judicial notice of pending settlement and petition for stay,\u201d in which he requested the court to stay the proceedings pending a settlement between the parties, as discussed below, he presented no evidence showing that a \u201cbinding settlement agreement\u201d existed. Thus, similar to <em>Freedson, </em>we conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in dismissing Wrubleski\u2019s petition. <em>See Freedson, </em>565 F.2d at 955; <em>see also Loren v. Sasser, </em>309 F.3d 1296, 1304 (11th Cir. 2002) (holding that, although <em>pro se </em>litigants are entitled to liberal construction of their pleadings, <em>pro se </em>litigants must follow procedural rules).</p>\n<p id=\"b622-7\">Even if we were to conclude that the tax court abused its discretion in dismissing Wrubleski\u2019s petition, Wrubleski has failed to show prejudice because his arguments in his petition either were without merit, or were ones that the tax court could not consider. <em>See Admiral Ins. Co. v. Cresent Hills Apartments, </em>328 F.3d 1310, 1312 (11th Cir.2003) (we \u201cmay affirm the district court\u2019s decision on any adequate ground, even if it is other than the one on which the court actually relied\u201d (quotation omitted)). During a CDP hearing, a taxpayer may raise \u201cany relevant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>issue relating to the unpaid tax or the proposed levy,\u201d including spousal defenses; challenges to the appropriateness of the collection action; and offers of collection alternatives. 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6330(c)(2)(A). A taxpayer, however, may not challenge the amount or existence of the underlying tax liability unless he \u201cdid not receive any statutory notice of deficiency for such tax liability or did not otherwise have an opportunity to dispute such tax liability.\u201d 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6330(c)(2)(B). On appeal to the tax court, a taxpayer also is limited to issues he raised during his CDP hearing. Treas. Reg. \u00a7 301.6330-1(f)(2).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b623-5\">As discussed above, Wrubleski received statutory notice of his deficiencies for tax years 1998 through 2000. Moreover, Wrubleski has failed to explain why he could not have contested these deficiencies during the 90-day period that he had to seek review. <em>See </em>26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6213(a) (setting a 90-day time limit on appeals of assessments of tax deficiencies to the tax court for a redetermination). Thus, Wrubleski could not challenge these deficiency amounts during his CDP hearing. <em>See </em>26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6330(c)(2)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b623-6\">To the extent Wrubleski also argued in the tax court that the Appeals Office refused to provide, or to identify, evidence that Wrubleski requested, the United States Code provides that \u201c[t]he appeals officer shall at the [CDP] hearing obtain verification from the Secretary that the requirements of any applicable law or administrative procedure have been met,\u201d 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6330(c)(1). Moreover, \u201c[t]he assessment [of taxes] shall be made by recording the liability of the taxpayer in the office of the Secretary in accordance with rules or regulations prescribed by the Secretary. Upon request of the taxpayer, the Secretary shall furnish the taxpayer a copy of the record of the assessment.\u201d 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6203.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b623-10\">We, however, have determined that \u00a7 6330(c)(1) \u201cdoes not require the Appeals officer to give the taxpayer a copy of the verification that the requirements of any applicable law or administrative procedure have been met.\u201d <em>See Roberts, </em>329 F.3d at 1228. We also concluded in <em>Roberts </em>that a computer transcript detailing the record of each assessment was sufficient verification, pursuant to \u00a7 6203, at least where there was no evidence to the contrary. <em>See id. </em>at 1225-28. Because the Appeals Office was not required to provide Wrubleski with verification that proper procedures were followed in assessing his deficiencies for tax years 1998 through 2000, and because the computer-generated records that the Commissioner attached to its motion for summary judgment detailed the record of each assessment and, thus, was sufficient under \u00a7 6203, at least where Wrubleski failed to present contradictory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>evidence, these arguments were without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-4\">To the extent Wrubleski alternatively is claiming that the tax court erred in dismissing his petition because of a settlement agreement that he asserted existed between the parties, \u201c[t]he Secretary may compromise any civil or criminal case arising under the internal revenue laws prior to reference to the Department of Justice for prosecution and defense.\u201d 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7122(a). The only three possible grounds for a compromise of federal tax liabilities are: (1) doubt as to liability; (2) doubt as to collectibility; and (3) the promotion of effective tax administration. Treas. Reg. \u00a7 301.7122-l(b). \u201cAn offer to compromise has not been accepted until the IRS issues a written notification of acceptance to the taxpayer or the taxpayer\u2019s representative.\u201d Treas. Reg. \u00a7 301.7122 \u2014 1(e)(1); <em>see also Klein v. C.I.R., </em>899 F.2d 1149, 1152-53 (11th Cir. 1990) (holding that a binding settlement on a tax liability must follow the requirements of the tax code which include the execution of a closing agreement). The requirements in \u00a7\u00a7 7121 and 7122, and the accompanying regulations, are exclusively and strictly construed. <em>Id. </em>at 1153 (citing <em>Botany Worsted Mills v. United States, </em>278 U.S. 282, 288-89, 49 S.Ct. 129, 131-32, 73 L.Ed. 379 (1929)); <em>see also Creel v. C.I.R., </em>419 F.3d 1135, 1141 (11th Cir.2005) (holding that the U.S. Attorney\u2019s actions would not bind the government, even if he intended to compromise a taxpayer\u2019s civil-tax liability, if the U.S. Attorney did not have authority to reach a compromise).</p>\n<p id=\"b624-7\">Even if we were to consider the \u201cAffidavit of Agreement\u201d that Wrubleski attempted to file in the tax court prior to his trial date, this document neither reflects that liability was at issue, nor that Wrubleski intended to pay the assessed amounts. None of the possible grounds for a compromise, therefore, existed in this case. <em>See </em>Treas. Reg. \u00a7 301.7122-1(b). More importantly, Wrubleski has not shown that the IRS issued \u201ca written notification of acceptance to the taxpayer or the taxpayer\u2019s representative,\u201d as required by Treas. Reg. \u00a7 301.7122\u20141(e)(1). Thus, even assuming for purposes of argument that the Commissioner refused tender of payment, declined to provide proof or evidence of a claim, and used Wrubleski\u2019s \u201ctrademark\u201d \u2014 conduct that Wrubleski claims demonstrates that the Commissioner implicitly ratified the alleged settlement agreement \u2014 this conduct was not sufficient under the tax code to create a \u201cbinding settlement.\u201d <em>See Klein, </em>899 F.2d at 1152.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-9\">Accordingly, we conclude that Wrubleski has failed to show that the tax court abused it discretion in granting the Commissioner\u2019s motion to dismiss his petition for review. We, therefore, affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b618-12\">. Section 6321 of Title 26 of the United States Code provides that, \"[i]f any person liable to pay any tax neglects or refuses to pay the same after demand, the amount ... shall be a lien in favor of the United States upon all property and rights to property, whether real or personal, belonging to such person.\u201d <em>See </em>26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6321. If a person neglects or refuses to pay such tax within ten days after notice and demand for payment, the Commissioner may collect such tax by levy upon property belonging to the person. <em>See </em>26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6331(a). The Commissioner, however, may not collect taxes by way of a levy on a person\u2019s property until the person is given notice of, and an opportunity for, an administrative review of the matter, such as in the form of a CDP hearing, and, if dissatisfied, provided judicial review of the administrative determination. <em>See </em>26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6330(a)-(d); <em>see also Roberts v. C.I.R., </em>329 F.3d 1224, 1227 (11th. Cir.2003).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b620-5\">. As part of this verification challenge, Wrubleski also argued that (1) \u201ccode 494\u201d was required to appear on transcripts to prove that notices of deficiencies were issued to him; (2) the absence of this code \"shed[] complete doubt on the validity of the balances of the entries on these transcripts\u201d; and (3) he was \u201cunable to verify or translate the meaning and significance of the IRS codes\u201d that appeared on his transcripts.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b620-6\">. As the Commissioner notes in its brief on appeal, Wrubleski has included in his record excerpts an \"Affidavit of Agreement,\u201d which purportedly is signed by attorneys representing the Commissioner. This document, however, is not part of the appellate record. Moreover, Wrubleski has not sought leave from this Court to supplement the record. Thus, we will not review it. <em>See Jones v. White, </em>992 F.2d 1548, 1566-67 (11th Cir. 1993) (explaining that, although \"[t]his [C]ourt\u2019s inherent equitable powers allow it to supplement the record with information not reviewed by the district [court],\u201d it \"[has] not allowed supplementation when a party has failed to request leave of this [C]ourt to supplement a record on appeal or has appended material to an appellate brief without filing a motion requesting supplementation\u201d). Regardless, as discussed below, in the absence of proof of formal acceptance, this document does not establish \u201ca binding settlement on a tax liability.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b621-7\">. Wrubleski also argues for the first time in reply that the Appeals Office erred in finding frivolous his constitutional challenge to the income tax.
