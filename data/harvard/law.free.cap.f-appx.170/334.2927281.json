Martinez-Esquivel first challenges the constitutionality of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)\u2019s treatment of prior felony and aggravated felony convictions as sentencing factors rather than elements of the offense that must be found by a jury in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). Martinez-Esquivel\u2019s constitutional challenge to \u00a7 1326(b) is foreclosed by <em>AlmendarezTorres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). Although Martinez-Esquivel contends that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>was incorrectly decided and that a majority of the Supreme Court would overrule <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>in light of <em>Apprendi, </em>we have repeatedly rejected such arguments on the basis that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>remains binding. <em>See United States v. Garza-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d 268, 276 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 298, 163 L.Ed.2d 260 (2005). Martinez-Esquivel properly concedes that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>has not been overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-7\">Martinez-Esquivel argues that his sentence is illegal under <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), because it was imposed pursuant to a mandatory application of the Sentencing Guidelines. In the district court, Martinez-Esquivel objected to the sentence under <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004). He now raises the type of error raised by a second respondent in <em>Booker, </em>Ducan Fanfan, i.e., that imposition of a sentence pursuant to a mandatory Guidelines regime violated his rights. <em>See Booker, </em>125 S.Ct. at 750, 768-69. The Government avers that Martinez-Esquivel has preserved a Fanfan-type error for appeal and that it, the Government, cannot show that the district court would not have sentenced Martinez-Esquivel differently under an advisory Guidelines regime.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-11\">Because the Government admits that it cannot show that the district court would not have sentenced Martinez-Esquivel differently under an advisory Guidelines system, <em>see United States v. Akpan, </em>407 F.3d 360, 377 (5th Cir.2005), we vacate the sentence and remand for resentencing in accordance with <em>Booker. </em>Martinez-Esquivel\u2019s argument that the Due Process and Ex Post Facto Clauses bar the application of Justice Breyer\u2019s remedy opinion in <em>Booker </em>is foreclosed by our prior caselaw. <em>See United States v. Scroggins, </em>411 F.3d 572, 576-77 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b361-12\">AFFIRMED IN PART; VACATED IN PART AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b360-28\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
