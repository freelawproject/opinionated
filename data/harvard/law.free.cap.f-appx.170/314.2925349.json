Cisneros argues that the evidence was insufficient to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that she is an alien. She argues that as the daughter of a mother who was born in the United States, she had \u201cderivative citizenship.\u201d After all of the evidence in the light most favorable to the Government, we hold that there was substantial evidence from which any rational trier of fact could have found beyond a reasonable doubt that Cisneros\u2019s mother was not born in the United States and thus was not a United States citizen from whom Cisneros could derive citizenship. <em>See United States v. Turner, </em>319 F.3d 716, 720-21 (5th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b340-20\">Cisneros also argues that her 57-month sentence violates the Due Process Clause because it exceeds the maximum two-year sentence for the \u00a7 1326(a) offense charged in the indictment. Her constitutional challenge is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). Although Cisneros contends that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>was incorrectly decided and that a majority of the Supreme Court would overrule <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), we have repeatedly rejected such arguments on the basis that <em>AlmendarezTorres </em>remains binding. <em>See United States v. Garza-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d 268, 276 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 298, 163 L.Ed.2d 260 (2005). Cisneros properly concedes that her argument is foreclosed in light of <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>and circuit precedent, but she raises it here to preserve it for further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-23\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b340-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
