Lopez-Cruz asserts because he was a mere drug user who was induced to sell drugs to Eric Jones as a means of assisting Perez Ruiz, a fellow gang member, pay off his gambling debt to Jones, he was entrapped as a matter of law. He further contends the Government\u2019s conduct in allowing Jones to conduct an illegal bookmaking operation, so that Jones could use his power and influence to set up a small drug transaction with a junkie, was outrageous, as it did not enforce drug trafficking laws and encouraged illegal gambling. We conclude these arguments are without merit, and affirm Lopez-Cruz\u2019s convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-15\">I. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b661-16\">A. <em>Entrapment</em></p>\n<p id=\"b661-17\">\u201cWhen a jury rejects an entrapment defense, our review is limited to determining whether the government presented sufficient evidence for a reasonable jury to conclude that the defendant was predisposed to take part in the crime.\u201d <em>United States v. Francis, </em>131 F.3d 1452, 1456 (11th Cir.1997). Although our review is de novo, we will \u201cview all evidence and make all inferences in favor of the government,\u201d and \u201ccannot overturn the jury\u2019s verdict if any reasonable construction of the evidence would allow the jury to find the defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cPredisposition is a fact intensive inquiry into the defendant\u2019s readiness and willingness to engage in the crime <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"636\">*636</page-number>absent any contact with the government\u2019s officers or agents. The government may not implant in an innocent person\u2019s mind the disposition to commit a crime, and then induce the person to commit the crime so it may prosecute.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b662-4\">Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the Government, the evidence was sufficient for a reasonable jury to find Lopez-Cruz\u2019s action of engaging in the drug sale was voluntary and willing. Although Lopez-Cruz asserts he was merely a drug addict, the evidence shows: (1) while he was housed at Coleman, Lopez-Cruz sold marijuana to Richard Darnell Helms 10 to 15 times; (2) after Jones put out the word he was interested in investing in drugs, Lopez-Cruz voluntarily approached Jones about making a deal; and (3) when Lopez-Cruz heard Jones wanted to buy some heroin, Lopez-Cruz obtained it from \u201chis people\u201d without hesitation. The record is devoid of any evidence that Lopez-Cruz was unwilling to make the drug sale, and, contrary to Lopez-Cruz\u2019s argument, there is no evidence Lopez-Cruz was forced to deal heroin because Perez owed Jones a gambling debt. Accordingly, sufficient evidence supported the jury\u2019s rejection of Lopez-Cruz\u2019s entrapment defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-5\">B. <em>Outrageous Governmental Conduct</em></p>\n<p id=\"b662-6\">Because Lopez-Cruz failed to raise below his due process argument that the Government\u2019s conduct was outrageous, we review the issue for plain error. <em>See United States v. Kelly, </em>888 F.2d 732, 739 n. 12 (11th Cir.1989) (noting that, where a defendant failed to raise a claim of outrageous governmental conduct at trial, we would review the issue for plain error). \u201cWe will correct plain error only where (1) there is an error; (2) the error is plain or obvious; (3) the error affects the defendant\u2019s substantial rights in that it was prejudicial and not harmless; and (4) the error seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of a judicial proceeding.\u201d <em>United States v. Orduno-Mireles, </em>405 F.3d 960, 961 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 223, 163 L.Ed.2d 191 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b662-10\">\u201cA conviction may be overturned when the government is involved in the criminal activity only when the government\u2019s involvement violates fundamental fairness and shocks the universal cause of justice.\u201d <em>United States v. Chastain, </em>198 F.3d 1338, 1352 (11th Cir.1999) (quotations and citation omitted). \u201cWhether outrageous governmental conduct exists turns upon the totality of the circumstances with no single factor controlling and the defense can only be invoked in the rarest and most outrageous circumstances.\u201d <em>United States v. Haimowitz, </em>725 F.2d 1561, 1577 (11th Cir. 1984) (quotations and citation omitted). Where the government is investigating offenses involving illegal drugs, it often must engage in undercover operations because it is very difficult to discover the contraband. This activity by the government does not generally constitute outrageous conduct. <em>United States v. Savage, </em>701 F.2d 867, 868-70 (11th Cir.1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b662-11\">Because the Government was permitted to engage in strategic undercover operations in order to discover illegal drugs, its use of a cooperating inmate, who was allowed to continue his bookmaking operations in order to maintain his connections to the prison\u2019s drug traffickers, was not outrageous in light of the totality of the circumstances. The district court did not plainly err by not, <em>sua sponte, </em>dismissing the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-12\">II. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b662-13\">The evidence was sufficient for a reasonable jury to reject the entrapment defense. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"637\">*637</page-number>Additionally, the Government\u2019s conduct was not outrageous. Thus, we affirm Lopez-Cruz\u2019s convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
