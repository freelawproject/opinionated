Villela claims the district court committed reversible error under <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), by sentencing him pursuant to a mandatory application of the Sentencing Guidelines <em>(Fanfan </em>error). The Government concedes that Villela has preserved this issue for appeal. Such error is not structural. <em>United States v. Martinez-Lugo, </em>411 F.3d 597, 601 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b929-24\">On the other hand, the Government has <em>not </em>shown beyond a reasonable doubt that the error was harmless. <em>See United States v. Walters, </em>418 F.3d 461, 463-64 (5th Cir.2005). Accordingly, Villela\u2019s sentence is vacated, and this case is remanded for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b929-25\">Villela also asserts the \u201cfelony\u201d and \u201caggravated felony\u201d provisions of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(1) and (b)(2) are unconstitutional in the light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). Villela\u2019s constitutional challenge is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). Although Villela contends that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>was incorrectly decided and that a majority of the Supreme Court would overrule it in the light of <em>Apprendi, </em>we have repeatedly rejected such assertions on the basis that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>remains <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"904\">*904</page-number>binding. <em>See United States v. Garza-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d 268, 276 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 298, 163 L.Ed.2d 260 (2005). Villela concedes his assertion is foreclosed in the light of <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>and circuit precedent; he raises it to preserve it for further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b930-6\">\n<em>CONVICTION AFFIRMED; SENTENCE VACATED; REMANDED FOR RESENTENCING.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b929-26\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
