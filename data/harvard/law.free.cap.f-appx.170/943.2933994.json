Small, Texas prisoner # 1014715, appeals the district court\u2019s dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"944\">*944</page-number>missal of his 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 civil rights complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6). Small argues that the district court erred in dismissing his claim against Judge Manny Alvarez based on absolute immunity. Small\u2019s reliance on <em>Turner v. Upton County, </em>915 F.2d 133, 138 (1990), is misplaced as it did not hold that a judge who has absolute immunity may be held liable for the actions of his alleged co-conspirators. <em>See Holloway v. Walker, </em>765 F.2d 517, 522 (5th Cir.1985) (\u201cIt is a well settled rule that where a judge\u2019s absolute immunity would protect him from liability for the performance of particular acts, mere allegations that he performed these acts pursuant to a bribe or conspiracy will not be sufficient to avoid immunity.\u201d). Because Small has not shown that the actions complained of were nonjudicial in nature or were taken in the complete absence of jurisdiction, the district court did not err in holding that Judge Alvarez was entitled to absolute immunity. <em>See Mireles v. Waco, </em>502 U.S. 9, 11-12, 112 S.Ct. 286, 116 L.Ed.2d 9 (1991); <em>Boyd v. Biggers, </em>31 F.3d 279, 284 (5th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b970-4\">Small argues that the district court erred in dismissing his claim against his attorney, Jim Moore. Small\u2019s claim against Moore is not cognizable under \u00a7 1983 because a defense attorney in a criminal proceeding is not a state actor. <em>Hudson v. Hughes, </em>98 F.3d 868, 873 (5th Cir.1996). Further, Small\u2019s allegations of a conspiracy are conclusional and do not suffice to state a civil rights conspiracy. <em>See Mills v. Criminal District Court </em># <em>3, </em>837 F.2d 677, 679 (5th Cir.1988); <em>see also Hale v. Harney, </em>786 F.2d 688, 690 (5th Cir.1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b970-8\">Small also argues that the district court erred in dismissing his claims based on <em>Heck v. Humphrey, </em>512 U.S. 477, 114 S.Ct. 2364, 129 L.Ed.2d 383 (1994), and he relies on <em>Wilkinson v. Dotson, </em>544 U.S. 74, 125 S.Ct. 1242, 161 L.Ed.2d 253 (2005). Small has not shown that his claim would not necessarily imply the invalidity of his conviction. Therefore, the district court did not err in holding that Small\u2019s claims were barred by <em>Heck. See Heck, </em>512 U.S. at 486-87, 114 S.Ct. 2364; <em>Kutzner v. Montgomery County, </em>303 F.3d 339, 340-41 (5th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b970-9\">The district court\u2019s judgment may be affirmed on any ground apparent from the record. <em>United States v. McSween, </em>53 F.3d 684, 687 n. 3 (5th Cir.1995). Jim Hamlin, Clerk of the district court, is entitled to absolute immunity as Small has not alleged that any of his actions were not taken under court order or at a judge\u2019s discretion. <em>See Clay v. Allen, </em>242 F.3d 679, 682 (5th Cir.2001). Further, Small\u2019s unsupported conclusional allegations are insufficient to establish a conspiracy between Hamlin and Dallas County. <em>See Mills, </em>837 F.2d at 679; <em>Hale, </em>786 F.2d at 690.</p>\n<p id=\"b970-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b969-21\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
