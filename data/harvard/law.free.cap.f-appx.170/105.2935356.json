Hall filed a complaint pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 against police officers H.R. Smith, L.D. Kitchen, M.S. Bozeman (the Officers), and the City of Jacksonville, Florida (the City), alleging: (1) the Officers\u2019 actions in forcibly entering his residence without a warrant and arresting him violated his Fourth and Fourteenth Amendment rights under color of state law; and (2) the City deliberately chose not to adequately train and supervise its employees, causing the Officers to violate his constitutional rights. Hall asserts the district court erred in dismissing his complaint without considering all of the evidence, namely, the police record of his arrest and a tape of a 911 call, which, he alleges, showed: (1) the Officers were not justified in entering and searching his apartment, (2) he was falsely arrested, and (3) the City had an official policy of inadequately training and supervising its employees. The district court did not err, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-7\">I. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b132-8\">We review a grant of a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim de novo, accepting the allegations in the complaint as true and construing them in the light most favorable to the plaintiff. <em>Spain v. Brown &amp; Williamson Tobacco Corp., </em>363 F.3d 1183, 1187 (11th Cir.2004). \u2018\u201c[A] complaint should not be dismissed for failure to state a claim unless it appears beyond a doubt that the plaintiff can prove no set of facts in support of his claim which would entitle him to relief.\u2019 \u201d <em>Marsh v. Butler County, Ala., </em>268 F.3d 1014, 1022 (11th Cir.2001) (en banc) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b132-11\">A. <em>Claims against the Officers</em></p>\n<p id=\"b132-12\">\u201cIn order to prevail on a civil rights action under \u00a7 1983, a plaintiff must show that he or she was deprived of a federal right by a person acting under color of state law.\u201d <em>Griffin v. City of Opa-Locka, </em>261 F.3d 1295, 1303 (11th Cir.2001). The Fourth Amendment provides: \u201cThe right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated....\u201d U.S. Const. amend. IV. However, \u201ca warrantless entry by criminal law enforcement officials may be legal when there is compelling need for official action and no time to secure a warrant.\u201d <em>United States v. Holloway, </em>290 F.3d 1331, 1334 (11th Cir.2002) (internal quotations and citations omitted). We have held \u201cwhen exigent circumstances demand an immediate response, particularly where there is danger to human life, protection of the public becomes paramount and can justify a limited, warrantless intrusion into the home.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(upholding a warrantless search that was based on an anonymous 911 call, coupled with the police officers\u2019 personal observances upon arriving at the scene).</p>\n<p id=\"b132-15\">Furthermore, \u201cprobable cause constitutes an absolute bar to ... \u00a7 1983 claims alleging false arrest....\u201d <em>Rankin v. Evans, </em>133 F.3d 1425, 1435 (11th Cir.1998). Probable cause exists when an arrest is \u201cobjectively reasonable under the totality of the circumstances.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotations and citations omitted). There is probable cause \u201cwhen the facts and circumstances within the officer\u2019s knowledge, of which he or she has reasonably trustworthy information, would cause a prudent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>person to believe, under the circumstances shown, that the suspect has committed, is committing, or is about to commit an offense.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal citations and quotations omitted). In addition, qualified immunity provides complete protection for government officials sued in their individual capacities as long as their conduct violates no \u201cclearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known.\u201d <em>Williams v. Consolidated City of Jacksonville, </em>341 F.3d 1261, 1267 (11th Cir.2003) (internal quotations and citations omitted). In evaluating whether an official is entitled to qualified immunity, as a threshold matter, we must determine \u201cwhether [the] plaintiffs allegations, if true, establish a constitutional violation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1268.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-5\">With respect to Hall\u2019s claims that the Officers unlawfully entered and searched his apartment and unlawfully arrested him, the district court did not err in concluding his complaint failed to allege facts showing the Officers violated his constitutional rights. Construing the complaint in the light most favorable to Hall, it shows the Officers: (1) received a 911 call stating a female was being beaten; (2) upon arriving, heard yelling and a female crying inside of Hall\u2019s apartment; (3) drew their guns, pointed them at Hall\u2019s door, and told him to open it; and (4) used a key to open Hall\u2019s door after Hall had refused to let them in. In light of these circumstances, the police officers were justified in entering Hall\u2019s residence without a warrant, as they were unable to verify that everyone inside the apartment was safe. <em>See Holloway, </em>290 F.3d at 1334. Furthermore, the complaint shows that, after being told several times to get to the ground, the police officers used force to place Hall on the ground, but Hall did not allege that he suffered any injuries during his arrest. Because resisting an officer without violence to his person is a crime in Florida, probable cause existed for Hall\u2019s arrest. <em>See Rankin, </em>133 F.3d at 1435; \u00a7 843.02, Fla. Stat. Moreover, the judicially-recognized fact that Hall subsequently pled no contest and was adjudged guilty demonstrates his detention was not unreasonable or unlawful. Accordingly, the district court did not err in finding exigent circumstances existed for the warrantless entry and the subsequent arrest was reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-7\">Finally, because Hall failed to establish he was deprived of a constitutional right, the district court did not err in concluding the Officers were entitled to qualified immunity. <em>See Williams, </em>341 F.3d at 1268. Additionally, although Hall asserts the district court erred in failing to consider all of the evidence, the district court was not permitted to consider evidence outside of the pleadings in determining whether to grant the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b). Further, even accepting all of Hall\u2019s allegations as true, they do not establish the Officers were not justified in entering Hall\u2019s apartment and arresting him for resisting them.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-8\">B. <em>Claims against the City</em></p>\n<p id=\"b133-9\">\u201c[I]t is well established that a municipality may not be held hable under section 1983 on a theory of respondeat superior.\u201d <em>Davis v. DeKalb County Sch. Dist., </em>233 F.3d 1367, 1375 (11th Cir.2000). The Supreme Court requires \u201ca plaintiff seeking to impose liability on a municipality under \u00a7 1983 to identify a municipal \u2018policy\u2019 or \u2018custom\u2019 that caused the plaintiffs injury.\u201d <em>Board of County Comm\u2019rs of Bryan County, Okl. v. Brown, </em>520 U.S. 397, 117 S.Ct. 1382, 1388, 137 L.Ed.2d 626 (1997). In addition, a plaintiff must show \u201ca municipal action was taken with ... deliberate indifference to its known or obvious consequences.\u201d <em>Davis, </em>233 F.3d at 1375-76. Vague and conclusory allegations will not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>support a claim under \u00a7 1983. <em>See Marsh, </em>268 F.3d at 1036 n. 16 (holding unsupported conclusions of law or mixed questions of fact and law have long been recognized as not to prevent a Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b) dismissal).</p>\n<p id=\"b134-4\">Because Hall alleged no factual support for his conclusory statement that the City had a policy or custom of grossly inadequate supervision and training of its employees, the district court did not err in dismissing Hall\u2019s claims against the City.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-5\">II. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b134-6\">The district court did not err in dismissing Hall\u2019s complaint for failure to state a claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
