Pursuant to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"652\">*652</page-number>statutes then relevant<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the Board of Directors of the Mount Vernon School District (Board), reciting the underlying facts and the conviction, notified Hoagland that it had concluded there was probable cause for his discharge. He was further suspended from teaching.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-4\">Pursuant to RCW 28A.58.515<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Hoagland elected to appeal directly to the Superior Court instead of requesting a hearing before the Board. The Board moved for summary judgment, dismissing Hoagland's appeal to the Superior Court, and Hoagland moved for summary judgment seeking reinstatement from suspension of his employment pending <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"653\">*653</page-number>the final hearing in this matter. After argument, the trial court took the case under advisement and issued a memorandum opinion granting the Board's motion. The trial court summarized the facts, stated the issue to be \"whether a teacher's conviction of the crime of grand larceny by possession, a felony, constitutes 'sufficient cause' for his discharge,\" and announced its decision:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b683-4\">This court finds that the Board of Directors of defendant district had sufficient cause to discharge plaintiff teacher under the agreed facts of this case. Plaintiff's felony conviction is inherently harmful to the teacher-student relation, and therefore harmful to the school district, and plaintiff's continued presence in the classroom would adversely affect the educational process of the district.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b683-5\">The trial court subsequently entered its order effectuating its decision and Hoagland appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-6\">We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-7\">Propriety of Summary Judgment Procedure</p>\n<p id=\"Ark3\">Hoagland first challenges the applicability of the summary judgment procedure to this action. Other than providing that a transcript of the Board's action be filed with the court, the statutes governing de novo hearings in superior court did not establish any rules or procedures for the court. CR 81 provides in material part: \"Except where inconsistent with rules or statutes applicable to special proceedings, these rules shall govern all civil proceedings. ...\" \"Special proceedings\" are not defined in the Superior Court Civil Rules. The generally accepted reference to special proceedings concerns attachment, certiorari, mandamus, prohibition and others incorporated under RCW Title 7. There are no special rules or procedures governing trials de novo under RCW 28A.58.480 which would be inconsistent with the applicability of summary judgment procedure to the case at bench.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-8\">The trial court did not err in applying the summary judgment rule CR 56 to this proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"654\">*654</page-number>Sufficient Cause for Discharge</p>\n<p id=\"b684-4\">The decision to discharge a teacher must be based \"solely upon the cause or causes for discharge specified in the notice of probable cause . . . and established by a preponderance of the evidence at the hearing\". RCW 28A.58-.450. The trial court granted the Board's motion for summary judgment despite the fact that the Board itself had made no finding or expressed any opinion as to whether the facts underlying Hoagland's prosecution were true or the conviction itself would constitute sufficient cause. The Board's decision finding \"probable cause for discharge\" was an ex parte preliminary decision initiating the discharge procedure and can form no basis for the court's independent determination of sufficient cause. Nor can the Board's actions be the basis for the findings of fact made by the court which are disputed. RCW 28A.58.450.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-5\">The parties dispute what issue was decided by the trial court. Hoagland asserts that the court decided that the conviction of a felony as a matter of law constitutes sufficient cause for discharge; the Board states that the trial court ruled Hoagland's conduct, upon which the conviction was based, constituted sufficient cause. The trial court framed the issue as \"whether a teacher's conviction of . . . grand larceny by possession, a felony, constitutes 'sufficient cause' for his discharge.\" We view the issue then, as suggested by Hoagland, to be whether as a matter of law the conviction of a felony constitutes sufficient cause to discharge a teacher.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-6\">Our beginning premise is that \"[t]he function of a summary judgment proceeding is to <em>determine whether a genuine issue of material fact exists. </em>It is <em>not ... to resolve the issues of fact or to arrive at conclusions based thereon.\" Duckworth v. Bonney Lake, </em>91 Wn.2d 19, 21, 586 P.2d 860 (1978). The function of the trial court and of this court on review is to determine whether as a matter of law summary judgment should have been granted on the basis of uncontroverted facts in the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"655\">*655</page-number>Hoagland argues that there are numerous facts, circumstances, and inferences which must be necessarily determined by a trier of the fact before sufficient cause may be found. The Board contends on the other hand that the fact of the conviction itself is an adequate basis for the inference that the misconduct was inherently harmful to the school district, and, therefore, the discharge is proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-4\">No guidelines or criteria have been provided by the legislature to determine when there is sufficient cause for a teacher's discharge, nor do the statutes make conviction for a crime sufficient cause for discharge. The legislature has not seen fit to define \"sufficient cause.\"</p>\n<p id=\"b685-5\">There has been little judicial elucidation in Washington of what constitutes \"sufficient cause\" for discharge of a teacher. The earliest definition appears in the case <em>Browne v. Gear, </em>21 Wash. 147, 151-52, 57 P. 359 (1899) where the court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b685-6\">Such cause, in the absence of a definition in the statute, would seem to be such misconduct relating to her duties as a common school teacher as would justify the revocation of her right to teach; that is, either such incompetency in her vocation in and about the school as made her unfit for the station, or violations of rules in teaching, etc., or such moral turpitude outside her profession as would recoil on her efficiency in her work and injure the school.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b685-7\">In <em>Gaylord v. Tacoma School Dist. 10, </em>85 Wn.2d 348, 535 P.2d 804 (1975) <em>(Gaylord </em>I), the court, relying on <em>Browne v. Gear, supra, </em>and <em>Denton v. South Kitsap School Dist. 402, </em>10 Wn. App. 69, 516 P.2d 1080 (1973), defined \"sufficient cause\" as \"conduct which would affect the teacher's efficiency.\" <em>Gaylord </em>I, at 349. In <em>Gaylord v. Tacoma School Dist. 10, </em>88 Wn.2d 286, 559 P.2d 1340 (1977) <em>(Gaylord </em>II), the court again considered whether a teacher's admitted homosexual status was sufficient cause for discharge under a school district policy providing for discharge on the grounds of immorality. The court then expanded on its definition of sufficient cause as requiring proof that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"656\">*656</page-number>questioned conduct adversely affected the teacher's ability to teach, saying:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b686-4\">The moral conduct of a teacher is relevant to a consideration of that person's fitness or ability to function adequately as a teacher of the students he is expected to teach \u2014 in this case high school students. <em>See Morrison v. State Bd. of Educ., </em>1 Cal. 3d 214, 225, 461 P.2d 375, 82 Cal. Rptr. 175 (1969).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b686-5\">\"Immorality\" as a ground of teacher discharge would be unconstitutionally vague if not coupled with resulting actual or prospective adverse performance as a teacher. <em>Denton v. South Kitsap School Dist. 402, </em>10 Wn. App. 69, 516 P.2d 1080 (1973); <em>Morrison v. State Bd. of Educ., supra </em>at 225 n.15. The basic statute permitting discharge for \"sufficient cause\" (RCW 28A.58.100(1)) has been construed to require the cause must adversely affect the teacher's performance before it can be invoked as a ground for discharge. <em>Gaylord v. Tacoma School Dist. 10, supra.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b686-6\"><em>Gaylord v. Tacoma School Dist. 10, supra </em>at 290. <em>(Gaylord </em>II).</p>\n<p id=\"b686-8\">The Board contends that <em>Denton </em>forecloses any inquiry into factors relating to the teacher's performance as a teacher. In <em>Denton </em>a junior high school teacher had sexual intercourse with a female high school student from the same school district. When the student became pregnant, she and Denton married. Both in <em>Gaylord </em>I, at 349 and <em>Gaylord </em>II, at 290, the court cited <em>Denton </em>for the proposition that before conduct can constitute sufficient cause it must adversely affect the teacher's performance as a teacher. In <em>Denton </em>there had been two fact-finding hearings before the cause reached the appellate court. The court there said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b686-9\">[T]he argument that \"immorality\" per se is not a ground for discharge without a showing of adverse effect upon \"fitness to teach\" or upon the school has merit (indeed this is a fair inference from <em>Browne v. Gear, supra), . . .</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b686-10\"><em>Denton v. South Kitsap School Dist. 402, supra </em>at 72. This must be the language which the <em>Gaylord </em>opinions approve. The <em>Denton </em>court's determination that sexual involvement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"657\">*657</page-number>between a teacher and student constitutes sufficient cause per se must be considered as dictum and without viability as a result of the <em>Gaylord </em>opinions.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-4\">For sufficient cause to be found the Board must demonstrate that the conduct upon which the sufficient cause allegation is based adversely affects the teacher's fitness to teach. This requirement of necessity poses material issues of fact which must be considered. The impact of the conviction and the conduct underlying it, upon Hoagland's fitness to teach, raises material factual issues which are unresolved here. <em>Morrison v. State Bd. of Educ., </em>1 Cal. 3d 214, 461 P.2d 375, 82 Cal.

By doing so, plaintiff submitted himself to the rules of procedure of that Superior Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-8\">One of the affidavits filed in this record was that of Thomas J. Pollino, the Superintendent of Mount Vernon School District No. 320, and secretary to the Board of Directors. Among other things, Mr. Pollino stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b688-9\">(5) Mr. Hoagland's criminal trial received much publicity in the Mount Vernon area. Between the time of Mr. Hoagland's arrest in January, 1976 and the time of his suspension in mid-March, 1976, numerous articles concerning Mr. Hoagland's activity appeared in the <em>Skagit Valley Herald </em>and the <em>Bellingham Herald. </em>(Numerous comprehensive and detailed articles concerning the plaintiff's trial appeared in numerous articles and were attached to the affidavit.) In one of these articles (Skagit Valley Herald dated May 15, 1976), the reporter quotes Judge Deierlein (the judge hearing the criminal case against Mr. Hoagland) as saying that the attention paid by the media to the case was because of Mr. Hoagland's status as a teacher;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b688-10\">(6) Members of the District's Board of Directors, as well as myself, received personal input from Mount Vernon citizens expressing concern about Mr. Hoagland's criminal activity including bringing stolen property onto District premises.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b689-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"659\">*659</page-number>Copies of newspaper articles appearing the Skagit Valley Herald and the Bellingham Herald, attached to this record, have such catchy headlines as \"Motorcycle Thefts Net Charges,\" \"Shop Teacher Charged,\" \"MV School Board Calls Special Session,\" \"School Taking No Action,\" \"Jury Hears Prosecution Case Against Teacher,\" \"Jury Finds Teacher Guilty of Larceny,\" \"Teacher Suspended,\" \"MV School Board Suspends Hoagland,\" \"Hoagland Sues School Board,\" \"MV Board Eyes Hoagland Lawsuit,\" and \"Hoag-land Sentenced; He'll Appeal.\" Anyone reading such newspaper articles could only conclude that the grand larceny conviction of plaintiff and his subsequent trial, appeal and sentencing was well known to the citizenry of Mount Vernon. Plaintiff does not dispute such facts nor could he. It is also undisputed that plaintiff was convicted of a felony, which conviction was affirmed on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-4\">The school board and the plaintiff both believed there were no genuine issues of any material fact for both moved for summary judgment asking for summary disposition.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The sole issue before the trial court, and now before this court, is whether a teacher's conviction of the crime of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"660\">*660</page-number>grand larceny by possession of stolen goods, a felony, constitutes \"sufficient cause\" for his discharge. The trial court, after examining the record, found:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b690-4\">This court finds that the Board of Directors of defendant District had sufficient cause to discharge plaintiff teacher under the agreed facts of this case. Plaintiff's felony conviction is inherently harmful to the teacher-student relation, and therefore harmful to the school district, and plaintiff's continued presence in the classroom would adversely affect the educational process of the district.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b690-5\">Whereas plaintiff previously agreed that there were no genuine issues of fact, he now claims there are for the purpose of this appeal. I believe that plaintiff was correct at the trial level. Hoagland voluntarily elected to forego the opportunity for a hearing before the district's Board of Directors and appealed directly to the Superior Court. In Superior Court he and his attorney advised the court that there were no genuine issues of fact and that the judge should make his decision as a matter of law. The trial judge complied and now on appeal plaintiff claims that there are genuine issues of fact. However, in resolving this appeal I will focus <em>only on defendant's motion </em>for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-6\">The Washington Supreme Court has established the following standards for sufficient cause:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b690-7\">The basic statute permitting discharge for \"sufficient cause\" (RCW 28A.58.100(1)) has been construed to require the cause must adversely affect the teacher's performance before it can be invoked as a ground for discharge.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b690-8\"><em>Gaylord v. Tacoma School Dist. 10, </em>88 Wn.2d 286, 290, 559 P.2d 1340, 1342-43 (1977). Although the Supreme Court did not explain its standard in detail, the court approvingly cited <em>Denton v. South Kitsap School Dist. 402, </em>10 Wn. App. 69, 516 P.2d 1080 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b690-9\">In <em>Denton, </em>the certificated employee was a junior high school teacher who dated and had sexual intercourse with a female high school student from the same school district. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"661\">*661</page-number>When the girl became pregnant, she and Denton married. Like Hoagland in this case, <em>Denton </em>cited California case authority for the proposition that his discharge could not be upheld absent a showing that his sexual misconduct reflects adversely upon his \"fitness to teach.\" <em>Denton v. South Kitsap School Dist. 402, supra </em>at 72.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-4\">The Court of Appeals upheld Denton's discharge, disposing of his \"fitness to teach\" argument as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b691-5\">While the argument that \"immorality\" per se is not a ground for discharge without a showing of adverse effect upon \"fitness to teach\" or upon the school has merit (indeed this is a fair inference from <em>Browne v. Gear, supra </em>[21 Wash. 147, 57 P. 359 (1899)]), we decline to set such a requirement where the sexual misconduct complained of directly involves a teacher and a minor student. In our view, <em>the school board may properly conclude in such a situation that the conduct is inherently harmful to the teacher-student relation, and thus to the school district. </em>We are accordingly of the opinion that Mr. Denton's conduct constituted sufficient cause for discharge.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b691-6\">(Italics mine.) <em>Denton v. Kitsap School Dist. 402, supra </em>at 72.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-7\">In <em>Denton, </em>the girl was from a different school and there was no allegation that the two ever had sexual intercourse on school premises or during school time. In contrast to <em>Denton, </em>in the subject case Hoagland purchased the stolen motorcycle from one of his former shop students. After stripping off the parts needed for his own motorcycle, Hoagland took the remaining parts of the stolen vehicle to school and allowed his students to work on them.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-8\">Part of a teacher's responsibility is to set an example for his students and to act as a role model, a responsibility made necessary by the fact that students spend more time with their teachers than with any persons other than immediate family members and closest friends.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-9\">Because of the importance of the teacher's role in the life of a student, a school district board of directors has a duty to the school community to maintain the highest standards <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"662\">*662</page-number>of fitness and competence for the weighty task of educating young impressionable students. The United States Supreme Court emphasized this principle in <em>Adler v. Board of Educ., </em>342 U.S. 485, 493, 96 L. Ed. 517, 72 S. Ct. 380, 27 A.L.R.2d 472 (1952), as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b692-4\">A teacher works in a sensitive area in a schoolroom. There he shapes the attitude of young minds towards the society in which they live. In this, the state has a vital concern. It must preserve the integrity of the schools. That the school authorities have the right and the duty to screen the officials, teachers, and employees as to their fitness to maintain the integrity of the schools as a part of ordered society, cannot be doubted.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b692-5\">The California case of <em>Jefferson Union High School Dist. v. Jones, </em>23 Cal. App. 3d 94, 100 Cal. Rptr. 73 (1972), is helpful in analyzing the subject case. In that case the plaintiff's possession of a quantity of marijuana was held sufficient cause for discharge. In so holding, the court relied on the following four factors: (1) the teacher's conduct was reported in the newspaper (thereby coming to the attention of students, fellow teachers, parents, and others); (2) many persons had expressed disapproval or concern at the prospect of having a teacher who had been convicted of marijuana possession instructing students; (3) the teacher's conduct was inconsistent with advice and instructions given the students by their parents; and (4) the teacher's conduct was inconsistent with the standards of behavior the school hoped to instill in its students. All of these factors were present in the subject case.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-6\">In <em>Gaylord v. Tacoma School Dist. 10, supra, </em>our Supreme Court upheld the discharge of a homosexual teacher, utilizing the following language at pages 298-99:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b692-7\">It is important to remember that Gaylord's homosexual conduct must be considered in the context of his position of teaching high school students. Such students could treat the retention of the high school teacher by the school board as indicating adult approval of his homosexuality. It would be unreasonable to assume <em>as a matter of law </em>a teacher's ability to perform as a teacher <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"663\">*663</page-number>required to teach principles of morality (RCW 28A.67-.110) is not impaired and creates no danger of encouraging expression of approval and of imitation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b693-5\">(Italics mine.) In <em>Gaylord, </em>even though there were no overt acts of homosexuality, our Supreme Court found as a matter of law that Gaylord's ability to perform as a teacher would be impaired by the mere fact that it had become known he was a homosexual. How much more so in the subject case where the plaintiff has been convicted of a criminal felony involving a series of criminal acts committed on the school premises involving students. Any reasonable person would conclude that Hoagland's retention as a teacher would mean to some that the school board favors such activities and would encourage students to behave in similar fashion.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-6\">If Hoagland would be reassigned to the classroom in Mount Vernon, a typical question from a pupil would undoubtedly be: \"Teacher, you teach us to obey the law and not to steal, yet you have just recently been convicted of grand larceny for doing that very thing. How do you reconcile what you teach with what you actually do?\"</p>\n<p id=\"b693-7\">How would plaintiff handle that question?</p>\n<p id=\"b693-8\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b693-9\">Plaintiff was convicted of knowingly possessing stolen goods. His arrest and conviction was made known to the Mount Vernon community through a series of newspaper articles, thereby elevating Hoagland to a high degree of notoriety among students, teachers, parents and other persons interested in the school community. As a result several persons expressed their concern to the district regarding the school employment of a teacher who by his actions appears to condone dishonesty and unlawful acts. This public knowledge of Hoagland's illegal conduct necessarily affects his ability to act as a good example and role model for his students, thereby impairing his fitness to continue teaching in the Mount Vernon community.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"664\">*664</page-number>I would affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-4\">Reconsideration denied August 16, 1979.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-5\">Appealed to Supreme Court September 26, 1979.</p>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b689-5\">The majority opinion recites that \u201cHoagland moved for summary judgment seeking reinstatement from suspension of his employment pending the final hearing in this matter.\" This is incorrect.

Defendant's motion for summary judgment is granted.\" The trial judge's order under date of April 25, 1977, reads, \"It is hereby ordered that Plaintiffs Motion for Summary Judgment is denied, and it is hereby ordered that defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment is granted.\"</p>\n<p id=\"b689-8\">The trial court never addressed the issue as to plaintiffs alternate request that he be reinstated in his employment position pending trial, but ruled summarily as a matter of law that plaintiff was not entitled to a hearing on his discharge.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
