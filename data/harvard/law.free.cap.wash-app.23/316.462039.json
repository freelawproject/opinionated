Trial is continued to October 10, 1977.</p>\n<p id=\"azy-dedup-0\">October 17, 1977: The case is assigned out to trial at which time a motion to dismiss is filed by the defense attorney for failure to bring Cummings to trial within 90 days, pursuant to CrR 3.3. The motion is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"AjG\">October 19, 1977: The jury finds Cummings guilty of first-degree rape and second-degree robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-17\">Decision</p>\n<p id=\"b348-18\">Cummings argues that more than 90 days elapsed before he was brought to trial because the 90-day time limit of CrR 3.3 began to run when he was held to answer by the juvenile authorities. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-19\">CrR 3.3(a) makes it the responsibility of the court to insure that a person \"charged with crime\" is brought to trial in accordance with its time limitations. A juvenile is not charged with crime while under the jurisdiction of the juvenile court. <em>In re Noble, </em>15 Wn. App. 51, 547 P.2d 880 (1976); <em>In re Chartrand, </em>107 Wash. 560, 182 P. 610 (1919); RCW 13.04.240. Therefore, the time limitations of CrR 3.3 did not begin to run while Cummings' case was pending in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>the juvenile court. <em>In re Chartrand, supra. </em>The trial court did not err in denying his motion to dismiss because the 90-day speedy trial rule was not violated.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-6\">Swanson, J., concurs.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b349-7\">Andersen, J.</author>\n<p id=\"aqt-dedup-0\">(concurring) \u2014 I concur in the result based on the reasoning of <em>State v.
