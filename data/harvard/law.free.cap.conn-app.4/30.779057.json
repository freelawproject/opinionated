The trial court rendered judgment awarding the plaintiff damages plus costs. The defendant appealed, claiming that the trial court erred: (1) in concluding that the defendant had con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>structive notice of the defect; (2) in concluding that the defect was the sole proximate cause of the injuries; (3) in accepting the testimony of the plaintiff\u2019s doctor; and (4) in awarding costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-5\">The first, second and third claims of error attack the trial court\u2019s findings of fact. Questions of fact are to be determined solely by the trial court. <em>Appliances, Inc. </em>v. <em>Yost, </em>186 Conn. 673, 676-77, 443 A.2d 486 (1982); <em>Connecticut National Bank </em>v. <em>Nagy, </em>2 Conn. App. 448, 449, 479 A.2d 1224 (1984). The weight given the evidence and the credibility of the witnesses are likewise within the province of that court. <em>Dubicki </em>v. <em>Dubicki, </em>186 Conn. 709, 713, 443 A.2d 1268 (1982). \u201cThis court will not reverse the decision of the trial court unless it is found to be \u2018clearly erroneous in light of the evidence and the pleadings in the record as a whole.\u2019 <em>Damora </em>v. <em>Christ-Janer, </em>184 Conn. 109, 113, 441 A.2d 61 (1981); <em>Pandolphe\u2019s Auto Parts, Inc. </em>v. <em>Manchester, </em>181 Conn. 217, 221, 435 A.2d 24 (1980); see Practice Book \u00a7 3060D.\u201d <em>Contoura Business Products, Inc. </em>v. <em>TLD, Inc., </em>1 Conn. App. 690, 692, 474 A.2d 1265 (1984), quoting <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Litchfield, </em>1 Conn. App. 40, 42, 467 A.2d 936 (1983). A review of the memorandum of decision and the record indicates that the court\u2019s conclusions are legally and logically correct and are supported by the facts set out in the memorandum of decision. The facts set out in the memorandum are supported by the evidence, and, on the basis of the whole record, those facts are not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-6\">As to the fourth claim of error, the defendant asserts that costs may not be taxed against a municipality in the absence of statutory authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-7\">During oral argument, the plaintiff represented that a bill of costs was presented to the clerk, who has not yet taxed costs. Although the procedure for taxing costs as provided by Practice Book \u00a7 412 has not been fol<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>lowed in this case, this fourth claim of error will be considered, in the interests of judicial economy, the parties having fully briefed the claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-5\">Costs which are taxable in civil actions are fixed by statute. General Statutes \u00a7 52-257; <em>Verrastro </em>v. <em>Sivertsen, </em>188 Conn. 213, 217, 448 A.2d 1344 (1982). Contrary to the defendant\u2019s claim, a municipality is not exempt from the taxation of costs, as is the state. Costs cannot be taxed against the state in the absence of a statute specifically allowing such taxation. <em>State </em>v. <em>Chapman, </em>176 Conn. 362, 366, 407 A.2d 987 (1978). This rule is based on the principle of sovereign immunity of the state. Unlike the state, a municipality has no sovereign immunity. <em>Murphy </em>v. <em>Ives, </em>151 Conn. 259, 264, 196 A.2d 596 (1963).</p>\n<p id=\"b46-6\">In the absence of a specific statutory exception or prohibition, General Statutes \u00a7 52-257 applies to the defendant. There is no such exception in General Statutes \u00a7 52-257 or in General Statutes \u00a7 13a-149, pursuant to which this action was brought. In comparison, General Statutes \u00a7 13a-144, which permits similar actions against the state for damages sustained on a state highway, bridge or sidewalk, specifically states that \u201cno costs or judgment fee in any such action shall be taxed against the defendant.\u201d We conclude that costs may properly be taxed against the defendant municipality in an action brought pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 13a-149.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-7\">There is no error; costs shall be taxed in accordance with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-8\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
