J.</author>\n<p id=\"Ar_\">The plaintiff, a licensed nursing home administrator, was arrested, pleaded nolo contendere to five counts of larceny and was sentenced after a grand juror completed a private inquiry into medicaid provider fraud at the nursing home of which he was the administrator. The report of the grand juror, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>transcript, and all of the evidence relating thereto were sealed by court order. Thereafter, the department of health services instituted administrative proceedings against the plaintiff, charging him with unacceptable conduct as a nursing home administrator in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 19a-517 (b) (1). Under that section, a person licensed to practice as a nursing home administrator may be disciplined, including the revocation of his license, if found to have \u201cengaged in fraud or material deception in the course of professional services or activities . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b562-5\">The plaintiff sought to prevent the report of the grand juror, the transcript and other evidence from being released to the department. The department, also referred to hereinafter as the defendant, cross applied to the trial court to allow such release and to release the witnesses and the plaintiff from any order of secrecy. The plaintiff appeals from the denial of his application and the granting of the defendant department\u2019s application.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We find error.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-6\">The plaintiff claims that the trial court erred (1) in not requiring the department to show a particular need and compelling circumstances before ordering the various releases, (2) in allowing the fruits of a grand jury investigation to be released to an administrative agency for use by it in a civil administrative proceeding and (3) in releasing witnesses from an order of secrecy so that they might testify before a state administrative agency.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>All of these claimed errors may be reduced to one issue. The question for resolution is what standard should be used to determine when sealed investigative grand juror materials may be made available to a civil governmental agency for use in a subsequent administrative proceeding against the target of a grand jury investigation after the grand jury has concluded its investigation, and after criminal charges against the target have been concluded by a judgment of guilty, following a plea of nolo contendere. No Connecticut case resolves this issue. The question raises the subsidiary question of whether federal case precedent should be followed and, if so, whether such cases require a preliminary showing by the agency of a particular and compelling need for the material or whether a balancing test weighing the traditional reasons for grand juror secrecy against the particular facts of the case will suffice. The trial court in this case did not require such a preliminary showing but, by using the reasons for the safeguarding of the confidentiality of federal grand juries as articulated in <em>United States </em>v. <em>Sells Engineering, Inc., </em>463 U.S. 418, 103 S. Ct. 3133, 77 L. Ed. 2d 743 (1983), concluded that these reasons were of little force within the context of this case and that such force as the reasons might have were \u201coutweighed by the public interest in the efficient functioning of the administrative process.\u201d In so concluding, the trial court looked to federal decisions for direction, but chose not to follow their path.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-5\">The plaintiff argues that the trial court erred in granting the department access to the grand jury materials, absent a showing of particularized need, for the purpose of preparing for and pursuing an administrative hearing on whether his license as a nursing home administrator should be revoked. He relies on federal case law for that proposition. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Baggot, </em>463 U.S. 476, 479-80, 103 S. Ct. 3164, 77 L. Ed. 2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>785 (1983); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Sells Engineering, Inc., </em>supra, 442-46; <em>Illinois </em>v. <em>Abbott &amp; Associates, Inc., </em>460 U.S. 557, 103 S. Ct. 1356, 75 L. Ed. 2d 281 (1983). These cases all involve Rule 6 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. <footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b565-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>The investigatory grand jury in Connecticut is governed by General Statutes \u00a7 54-47.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> General Statutes \u00a7 54-47 (g) provides that \u201cthe court shall direct whether, and to what extent, the report [of the grand <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>juror] shall be made available to the public or interested parties.\u201d Pursuant to the same statute, the trial court has the same power with reference to the transcript of the testimony. The trial court, pursuant to that authority, released the requested materials and the witnesses from their oath of secrecy.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The predecessor of General Statutes \u00a7 54-47 (g) was enacted in 1941. Public Acts 1941, No. 158.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"Aeu\">A rule on the federal grand jury was not contained in the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure until the third draft of the rules, dated March 4,1942, was circulated. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Sells Engineering, Inc., </em>supra, 452-53, (Burger, C.J., dissenting); Orfield, The Federal Grand Jury, 22 F.R.D. 343, 346 (1959). The argument, thus, that General Statutes \u00a7 54-47 be interpreted in light of the decisional authority pertaining to federal grand jury disclosure is persuasive, not because the Connecticut statute was patterned on the federal rule but because both originate from the com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>mon law requirement that grand jury testimony be secret. The indicting grand jury governed by federal rule and the investigatory grand jury governed by \u00a7 54-47 are similar in function.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-5\">Prior to the enactment of General Statutes \u00a7 54-47, Connecticut\u2019s courts had sought direction from federal case law on issues involving grand jury proceedings. <em>State </em>v. <em>Hayes, </em>127 Conn. 543, 577-80, 18 A.2d 895 (1941); <em>State </em>v. <em>Kemp, </em>126 Conn. 60, 67, 9 A.2d 63 (1939). Our Supreme Court, in the context of a grand jury proceeding pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 54-45 (a), relying on federal case law, stated that \u201cthe traditional secrecy of grand jury proceedings is well entrenched in the common law\u2014\u2018older than our Nation itself,\u2019 <em>Pittsburgh Plate Glass Co. </em>v. <em>United States, </em>360 U.S. 395, 399, 79 S. Ct. 1237, 3 L. Ed. 2d 1323 (1959) . . . .\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Canady, </em>187 Conn. 281, 287, 445 A.2d 895 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b567-6\">\u201cRule 6 (e) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure codifies the traditional rule of grand jury secrecy.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Sells Engineering, Inc., </em>supra, 425; <em>Illinois </em>v. <em>Abbott &amp; Associates, Inc., </em>supra, 566 n.11. That portion of the rule authorizing a court to disclose grand jury materials provides no substantive standard governing the issuance of such orders. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Sells Engineering, Inc., </em>supra, 442-43. The United States Supreme Court has \u201cconsistently construed the Rule, however, to require a strong showing of particularized need for grand jury materials before any disclosure will be permitted.\u201d Id., 443. The standard was set forth in <em>Douglas Oil Co. </em>v. <em>Petrol Stops Northwest, </em>441 U.S. 211, 99 S. Ct. 1667, 60 L. Ed. 2d 156 (1979). The court commented: \u201cParties seeking grand jury transcripts under Rule 6 (e) must show that the material they seek is needed to avoid a possible injustice in another judicial proceeding, that the need for disclosure is greater than the need for continued secrecy, and that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>their request is structured to cover only the material so needed.\u201d Id., 222. The United States Supreme Court also provided the typical instances where the particularized need is met, as where <em>\u201ca </em>litigant seeks to use \u2018the grand jury transcript at the trial to impeach a witness, to refresh his recollection, to test his credibility and the like.\u2019 Such use is necessary to avoid misleading the trier of fact. Moreover, disclosure can be limited strictly to those portions of a particular witness\u2019 testimony that bear upon some aspect of his direct testimony at trial.\u201d Id., 222 n.12.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-5\">An historical analysis of General Statutes \u00a7 54-47 is necessary so that the federal case law can be compared to the practice in Connecticut. Our Supreme Court has analogized the investigatory inquiry pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 54-47 to the common law grand jury which could inquire into crimes. <em>State </em>v. <em>Moynahan, </em>164 Conn. 560, 565, 325 A.2d 199, cert. denied, 414 U.S. 976, 94 S. Ct. 291, 38 L. Ed. 2d 219 (1973); <em>State </em>v. <em>Menillo, </em>159 Conn. 264, 273, 268 A.2d 667 (1970). Indeed, the only material distinction between the two is that the common law grand jury had the authority or power to issue an indictment. <em>State </em>v. <em>Moynahan, </em>supra, 565. It is appropriate, thus, to examine the case law concerning Connecticut\u2019s common law grand jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-6\">In <em>State </em>v. <em>Fasset, </em>16 Conn. 457 (1844), the defendant moved to quash the indictment handed down by the grand jury. In support thereof, the defendant sought to elicit testimony from the grand jurors and the witnesses before the grand jury impeaching the grand jury\u2019s verdict. Citing the policy of the law that such proceedings be in secret, the court ruled that the defendant\u2019s evidence was inadmissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-7\">Connecticut has limited the lifting of the veil of grand jury secrecy of the testimony before it to prosecutions for perjury and to contradicting witnesses. <em>State </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number><em>Coffee, </em>56 Conn. 399, 412, 16 A. 151 (1888). In that case, the admission of the grand juror\u2019s testimony concerning the defendant\u2019s declarations was upheld because they were not part of the grand jury proceedings. Id., 413. Those two cases consider the issue of grand jury secrecy in the context of the constitutional grand jury empowered to indict. <em>State </em>v. <em>Menillo, </em>supra, 274. The importance of the preservation of grand jury secrecy was reiterated in <em>State </em>v. <em>Kemp, </em>supra, 68, which considered grand jury secrecy in the context of the general investigatory grand jury known to the common law. In fact, the policy advanced there to provide for transcribing the testimony before the grand jury was to insure a record for any further prosecution for perjury. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-5\">In <em>State </em>v. <em>Hayes, </em>supra, another case involving the general investigatory grand jury known to the common law, the defendants claimed that the trial court erred in denying their request to inspect the grand jury minutes. The court stated that \u201c[ejven where a defendant is indicted by a grand jury, he has no right to inspect the testimony taken before it and the matter is at most within the discretion of the trial court, to be exercised only for strong reasons and rarely, if ever, where the purpose is merely to assist him in preparing his defense.\u201d Id., 580. Again, the court recognized that the veil of secrecy was generally lifted only for prosecutions for perjury and for use in contradicting witnesses. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-6\">Moreover, that case involved the defendants\u2019 request for the testimony of two of the state\u2019s witnesses because of an apparent contradiction between certain testimony elicited at the trial from that elicited before the grand jury. The trial court examined the testimony of the witnesses and released only the pertinent portions of the testimony to the defendants in the interests of preserving grand jury secrecy. Our Supreme <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>Court upheld this disposition, concluding that it was amply justified. Id., 601-602. The policy of grand jury secrecy is thus entrenched in the common law.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-5\">In the context of General Statutes \u00a7 54-45a which relates to an indicting grand jury, the secrecy of the testimony obtained during the proceedings before it remains inviolate unless, in the discretion of the trial court, it is persuaded that statements made there are inconsistent with statements made at trial, or that the testimony is needed to impeach a witness or to attack the credibility of a witness. <em>State </em>v. <em>Burns, </em>194 Conn. 469, 472-73, 481 A.2d 1077 (1984); <em>State </em>v. <em>Maldonado, </em>193 Conn. 350, 478 A.2d 581 (1984); <em>State </em>v. <em>Canady, </em>supra. In the latter case, the court stated that any change in the traditional secrecy of grand jury proceedings, which is well entrenched in the common law, must be strictly construed. Id., 287. Further, the discretion of the trial court exercised to permit disclosure should be for strong reasons only. <em>State </em>v. <em>Burns, </em>supra, 473. That case relies on <em>State </em>v. <em>Hayes, </em>supra, 580, which involved the common law grand jury for that proposition. \u201cParticularized need\u201d and the phrase \u201cstrong reasons\u201d connote a similar standard for the exercise of the trial court\u2019s discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-6\">All these cases form the backdrop on which General Statutes \u00a7 54-47 (g) must be interpreted, particularly since its language is virtually unchanged from that of its statutory predecessor of 1941. No radical departure from the long standing policy of preserving grand jury secrecy which is well entrenched in the common law is warranted unless the language of the statute unequivocally expresses such an intent. <em>Gomeau </em>v. <em>Forrest, </em>176 Conn. 523, 527, 409 A.2d 1006 (1979); see <em>Illinois </em>v. <em>Abbott &amp; Associates, Inc., </em>supra, 572-73.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-7\">The Connecticut legislature has not attempted to change the basic precept of the common law which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>guaranteed the concealment of grand jury proceedings, nor has it chosen to provide any guidelines for the release of a grand juror\u2019s report or the transcript of grand jury proceedings other than to state that the court \u201cshall direct whether, and to what extent, the report shall be made available to the public or interested parties.\u201d Without statutory parameters, case precedent, both federal and state, must be the trial court\u2019s shepherd in determining what tethers may bind the discretion given to the court by the statute. Both Rule 6 and General Statutes \u00a7 54-47 provide for a general rule of secrecy. The scope of each, of necessity, lies in historical considerations and in judicial interpretation. See note, \u201cAdministrative Agency Access to Grand Jury Materials,\u201d 75 Colum. L. Rev. 162 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b571-5\">Federal cases have required a showing of \u201cparticularized need\u201d before the traditional secrecy of grand jury proceedings may be disturbed and Connecticut cases have required a showing of \u201cstrong reasons.\u201d This court is persuaded that it is appropriate to consult federal case law in the absence of a Connecticut Supreme Court precedent and in the absence of any substantive state statutory guide. We thus hold that the public or interested parties seeking access to grand jury materials must first demonstrate a particularized need.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-6\">This holding is spawned not only by federal case law but by traditional considerations which form the basis for that case law. Secrecy is a safeguard for the grand jury process itself and prevents the use of that process as an instrument to aid in future civil proceedings. Grand juries are aids to the criminal justice system. To use grand jury material for civil purposes under the guise of present expediency, and without a compelling and special need, is to threaten important rights. \u201cA number of serious consequences flow from the administrative agencies\u2019 increased access to grand jury materials. To the extent that access is gained to information <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number>unobtainable by the use of the agencies\u2019 own investigative procedures, the limits on agency power which Congress sought to build into the statutes are circumvented.\u201d Id., 178-79.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-5\">A grand jury in this state has vast powers to conduct a general inquiry into criminal activity, without specifying a particular crime or person to be investigated. General Statutes \u00a7 54-47 is a legislative response to history and to a need of the public to prevent criminal activity and to prosecute those responsible for such criminal activity. The release of what is learned by such a massive intrusion on privacy, without the usual procedural and evidentiary protections available at trial, should only be sparingly granted to an administrative agency within specific judicial borders of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-6\">In this case the defendant has already been found guilty of five counts of larceny. The elements of larceny include (1) an intent (2) to deprive another of property and (3) the wrongful taking, obtaining or withholding of such property from an owner. General Statutes \u00a7 53a-119. The elements of wrongdoing for revocation of a nursing home administrator\u2019s license as described in General Statutes \u00a7 19a-517 (b) are not coterminous. Questions asked of the defendant and answered by him during the grand jury proceeding may have been relevant to the crime of larceny, and some may not have been relevant to the crime. Those without relevancy to the crime may, however, be relevant to the standards for revocation of the plaintiff\u2019s license. If this information could not have been obtained through use of the department\u2019s own investigative powers, to provide the department with access to it is, in effect, to give the department the powers of a grand jury. Without a particular or compelling need to do so, and without a legislative mandate to do so, the department is not entitled to the information.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>To grant access to an agency of grand jury material is to invade the grand jury\u2019s secrecy, but to deny access to it may require a duplication of effort. Note, \u201cFacilitating Administrative Agency Access to Grand Jury Material,\u201d 91 Yale L. J. 1614,1617 (1982). Until the legislature enacts an amendment, however, to General Statutes \u00a7 54-57, it remains more important to preserve secrecy than to give an administrative agency access to material without some good cause, other than a claim of duplicative effort.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-5\">Although many of the reasons for secrecy of grand jury proceedings no longer obtain after the conclusion of the proceedings and after the conviction of crimes stemming from the proceedings, some do. Two reasons are the protection of witnesses from retaliation in the event that a conviction is had without a trial and the protection of the integrity of the functioning of future grand juries. Those witnesses who learn that their testimony was not sacrosanct will be deterred from future uninhibited testimony, as will others not involved in the particular grand jury process.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-6\">The trial court, after noting that most of the factors militating against disclosure were not present, concluded that disclosure was warranted because of the public interest in the efficient functioning of the administrative process. This argument advanced in support of access was rejected by the United States Supreme Court as in and of itself not justifying a breach of grand jury secrecy. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Sells Engineering, Inc., </em>463 U.S. 418, 431, 103 S. Ct. 3133, 77 L. Ed. 2d 743 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b573-7\">The department in this case also asserted that access to the grand jury material is needed to insure that the plaintiff\u2019s testimony does not change. A similar argument was proffered in <em>Douglas Oil Co. </em>v. <em>Petrol Stops Northwest, </em>441 U.S. 211, 99 S. Ct. 1667, 60 L. Ed. 2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number>156 (1979), and the Supreme Court stated that after the witness testifies at a deposition or at trial, his prior testimony should be examined and then the court should decide whether and to what extent disclosure is warranted. <em>Douglas Oil Co. </em>v. <em>Petrol Stops Northwest, </em>supra, 228-29. The trial court here did not defer acting until the plaintiff testified at the administrative proceeding, nor did it require the department to make an initial showing of a particular need or a compelling reason for release of the material.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-5\">This court finds that the trial court abused its discretion under the circumstances by granting access to the transcript and the report to the department.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-6\">The order concerning the release of the witnesses from any order of secrecy, the department correctly concedes, depends on the outcome as to whether access to the transcript should be granted. <em>State </em>v. <em>Fasset, </em>supra, 469-70; but see <em>State </em>v. <em>Coffee, </em>supra. This court therefore concludes that the trial court also erred in releasing the witnesses from any order of secrecy.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-7\">By holding that the trial court erred in releasing the grand juror\u2019s report and transcript since the department here failed to establish the requisite particularized need, this court does not foreclose the department from satisfying that requirement when this action is remanded to the trial court. Further, the department has not established that the discovery tools provided to it by statute will not suffice in yielding access to the same material that the department seeks through the release of the grand juror\u2019s report and the transcript proceeding. In exercising its regulatory jurisdiction over nursing home administrators, pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 19a-14 (c), the department has the authority to \u201cadminister oaths, issue subpoenas, compel testimony and order the production of books, records and documents. If any person refuses to appear, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"559\">*559</page-number>to testify or to produce any book, record or document when so ordered, a judge of the superior court may make such order as may be appropriate to aid in the enforcement of this section . . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 19a-14 (a) (10).</p>\n<p id=\"b575-5\">Requiring the department to exhaust the discovery tools provided to it by statute and regulation before recourse to the grand juror\u2019s report and the transcript of the proceeding may avoid the affirmative mischief feared by the United States Supreme Court in <em>Sells, </em>which could result from carte blanche access to a grand juror\u2019s report and the transcript of the proceeding on the sole claim that the public interest in the efficient functioning of the administrative process mandated release. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Sells Engineering, Inc., </em>supra, 431-35. Some of the concerns expressed by the United States Supreme Court in the release of grand jury testimony, absent a showing of particularized need, were that the integrity of the grand jury may be injured by the manipulation of the process to ferret out evidence useful in a civil proceeding, and the fundamental unfairness of allowing a governmental agency to bypass the discovery tools provided to it by statute and regulation, which contain procedural and substantive restraints on the agency\u2019s discovery junket, by permitting access to grand jury proceedings where the governmental body is relatively unregulated in its use of discovery techniques. Id., 432-34.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-6\">There is error, the judgment is set aside and the case is remanded for further proceedings in accordance with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-7\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b562-7\"> The state\u2019s attorney for the criminal grand jury investigation is not a party to this appeal. That office, however, took the position in the trial court that no documents should be released but that the witnesses should be released from any order of secrecy. Neither party has raised any jurisdictional problem with this appeal. Unlike <em>In Re Investigation of the Grand Juror into the Bethel Police Department, </em>188 Conn. 601,452 A.2d 935 (1982), the trial court\u2019s decision regarding release was not sua sponte but upon the application and cross application of the parties. It is, therefore, concluded that an appeal lies.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"Aj7\"> Rule 6 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, in pertinent part, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b564-6\">\u201c(e) recording and disclosure of proceedings. . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b564-7\">(2) GENERAL RULE of SECRECY.
