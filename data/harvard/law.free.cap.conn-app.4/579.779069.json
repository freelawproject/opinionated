The defendants answered, claiming setoffs against the sum due, and counterclaimed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>for damages arising out of alleged defective and incomplete work, and undue delays in completing the work undertaken.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-5\">After a full trial before <em>Hon. Roman J. Lexton, </em>state trial referee, judgment was rendered for the plaintiff on the complaint and for the defendants on the counterclaim.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-6\">The sole issue for our consideration is whether the damages awarded on the counterclaim are justified, in view of the evidence presented at trial. We consider the claim of error in this regard to be completely without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-7\">The trial referee prepared a meticulously detailed memorandum of decision which, when analyzed objectively and completely, negates the plaintiff\u2019s claims of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-8\">We are not the finders of fact; that is for the trial court. <em>Kaplan </em>v. <em>Kaplan, </em>186 Conn. 387, 391, 441 A.2d 629 (1982); <em>Robert Lawrence Associates, Inc. </em>v. <em>Del Vecchio, </em>178 Conn. 1, 4, 420 A.2d 1142 (1979); <em>Riccio </em>v. <em>Abate, </em>176 Conn. 415, 418, 407 A.2d 1005 (1979); <em>Hirst </em>v. <em>Hirst, </em>2 Conn. App. 348, 350, 478 A.2d 618 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b596-9\">Our review is limited to a determination of whether the decision made is logically consistent and supported by the evidence. <em>Pandolphe\u2019s Auto Parts, Inc. </em>v. <em>Manchester, </em>181 Conn. 217, 221-22, 435 A.2d 24 (1980).
