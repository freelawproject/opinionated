In his reasons of appeal, the commissioner stated that the decedent left the residue of her estate to an alleged charitable foundation to be formed after her death. Inasmuch as the charitable foundation was not structured within five years after her death as required by General Statutes \u00a7 12-347, the commissioner claimed that the estate is liable for succession taxes in an amount exceeding one million dollars.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-11\">Kalman Nulman and Joseph Weill (the applicants), are former co-executors of the estate, who were removed because of their alleged failure timely to form <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>the charitable foundation. They sought to intervene in the appeal to the Superior Court, claiming that they may be personally responsible for any succession tax which may be recovered against the estate. From the trial court\u2019s denial of their motion to intervene, they have appealed to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-5\">Subsequent to oral argument of this appeal, we learned that the Superior Court case in which the applicants sought to intervene has been withdrawn.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Therefore, the applicant\u2019s appeal is moot. See <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Ricker, </em>172 Conn. 572, 375 A.2d 1034 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b266-6\">The appeal is dismissed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b266-15\"> The commissioner\u2019s withdrawal was filed on May 2,1985, in <em>Commissioner of Revenue Services </em>v. <em>Estate of Daphne Culpeper, </em>Superior Court, Judicial District of Stamford-Norwalk, No. 83 0064 322S.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
