The matter was tried to a jury and judgment was rendered in favor of the plaintiffs. The defendant appealed claiming the court erred in its charge to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-13\">The defendant claims that the court erred by failing to instruct the jury (1) that the defendant\u2019s responsibility to compensate the plaintiffs is limited if the plain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>tiff\u2019s disability arose from a subsequent accident, and (2) that the defendant had no responsibility for those injuries attributable to a preexisting condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-5\">The record indicates that the defendant failed to file a motion to set aside the verdict as required by Practice Book \u00a7 320 or \u00a7 3000. Such failure limits our review to the standard of plain error. Practice Book \u00a7 3063; <em>Pietrorazio </em>v. <em>Santopietro, </em>185 Conn. 510, 513-16, 441 A.2d 163 (1981); <em>Denby </em>v. <em>Voloshin Cadillac, Inc., </em>3 Conn. App. 181, 183, 485 A.2d 1360 (1985); <em>Eagar </em>v. <em>Barron, </em>2 Conn. App. 468, 472, 480 A.2d 576 (1984); <em>Rozbicki </em>v. <em>Pelletier, </em>2 Conn. App. 87, 88, 476 A.2d 1069 (1984). Examination of the record gives no indication of plain error; the charge as given, relating to disabilities claimed to arise from a subsequent accident and relating to injuries claimed to be attributable to a preexisting condition, was correct in law, adapted to the evidence and issues and sufficient to guide the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-6\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-7\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
