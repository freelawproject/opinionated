The sole issue on this appeal is whether the court had continuing jurisdiction to modify a judgment providing for the assignment of property under General Statutes \u00a7 46b-81.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-6\">General Statutes \u00a7 46b-86 (a) provides: \u201cUnless and to the extent that the decree precludes modification, any final order for the periodic payment of permanent alimony or support or alimony or support pendente lite may at any time thereafter be continued, set aside, altered or modified by said court upon a showing of a substantial change in the circumstances of either party. This section shall not apply to assignments under \u00a7 46b-81 or to any assignment of the estate or a portion thereof of one party to the other party under prior law.\u201d As stated in <em>Bunche </em>v. <em>Bunche, </em>180 Conn. 285, 289, 429 A.2d 874 (1980): \u201cThis provision confers on the court continuing jurisdiction, except where precluded by the decree, to modify orders for the periodic <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"665\">*665</page-number>payment of permanent or pendente lite alimony or support upon a showing of a substantial change in the circumstances of either party. See <em>Viglione </em>v. <em>Viglione, </em>171 Conn. 213, 215, 368 A.2d 202 (1976). By its terms, the statute deprives the Superior Court of continuing jurisdiction over that portion of a dissolution judgment providing for the assignment of property of one party to the other party under General Statutes \u00a7 46b-81.\u201d See also <em>Misinonile </em>v. <em>Misinonile, </em>190 Conn. 132, 134, 459 A.2d 518 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b681-5\">The supplemental judgment provides that upon the sale of the property \u201cthe proceeds remaining after the payment of expenses and costs resulting from the sale, shall be distributed 60 percent to the plaintiff and 40 percent to the defendant.\u201d Thus, the judgment, in effect, assigned 10 percent of the defendant\u2019s interest in the property to the plaintiff under the authority of \u00a7 46b-81 and is therefore nonmodifiable. See <em>Bunche, </em>v. <em>Bunche, </em>supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-6\">We note that the plaintiff was found in contempt on July 23, 1984, for failure to list the property for sale and that no appeal was taken from that finding which is still in effect.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> It would appear that this appeal was taken solely for the purpose of delay and it has accomplished that purpose.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b681-7\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-8\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b680-7\"> The motion claimed that \u201c[tjhe minor child of the parties will be eighteen at the end of May, 1984 which in accordance with the supplemental judgement of December 11,1980 would require the property at Park Street in New Canaan, Connecticut to be sold, but the child at that time will have only finished his junior year in school. With the sale of the premises, the child will be unable to finish school in New Canaan. He will be uprooted from his peers and friends which would work an injustice on the child and as such, the plaintiff asks that the sale be postponed until the minor child has graduated from high school.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b681-9\"> The court\u2019s handwritten decision on the motion for contempt provides: \u201cThe foregoing [contempt] motion having been heard, it is hereby GRANTED. The plaintiff and Defendant are to comply forthwith [with] the court order of 12/11/80 no later than 8/4/84 re sale of property.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b681-10\">\u201cThe plaintiff is to make the house available for inspection by the defendant and his broker on July 28 or 29, 1984.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b681-11\">\u201cIf the plaintiffs broker and the defendant\u2019s broker can\u2019t agree on a price a 3rd broker is to be nominated to set the price.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b681-12\"> In view of the fact that the plaintiff was and still is in contempt, the court would have been justified in dismissing the appeal sua sponte. <em>Greenwood </em>v. <em>Greenwood, </em>191 Conn. 309, 313-14, 464 A.2d 771 (1983).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
