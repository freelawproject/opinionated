The original judgment was based on the oral stipulation of the parties, made in open court. The defendant\u2019s major claims are three: (1) that the defendant was denied a fair hearing because the court\u2019s twenty-three paragraph factual statement was taken verbatim from the plaintiff\u2019s proposed findings of fact submitted to the trial court after the hearing on the motion to open; (2) that the court\u2019s findings of fact were unsupported by the evidence and thereby were clearly erroneous; and (3) that the court erred in its conclusion that the defendant did not meet the requirements for opening a judgment based on fraud. Boiled down, the latter two issues merge into the single issue of whether the court\u2019s judgment was clearly erroneous. Practice Book \u00a7 3060D.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We conclude that the defendant was not denied a fair hearing and that the judgment was not clearly erroneous. We, therefore, find no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-7\">There is no dispute about the procedural background of this case. On May 28,1981, the third day of the dissolution trial, the court, <em>Hon. William L. Tierney, Jr., </em>state trial referee, dissolved the thirty year marriage of the parties incorporating into the judgment an oral settlement, stipulated to by the parties, regarding the division of property and nonmodifiable alimony. The plaintiff, fifty-six years old at the time, was a gradu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>ate of the Wharton School of Finance and Columbia Law School who had been successfully involved for many years in business for himself. The defendant, fifty-three years old, was a graduate of Simmons College and is the sole shareholder and employee of Minuteman Realty Company. The parties have three grown children.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-5\">The plaintiffs chief vehicle for his various business interests was Grayson Associates, Inc., a Connecticut corporation of which he was the sole shareholder. With immaterial exceptions, all of his various forms of income and investment funneled through this conduit, which he controlled totally. He was a general partner in three limited partnerships operating three bowling centers, Nutmeg Bowl, Colonial Lanes, and Laurel Lanes, the profits from which were paid to Grayson Associates, Inc. He was also the sole shareholder in three corporations operating lounges associated with these bowling centers, the profits from which were turned over to the bowling centers. Grayson Associates, Inc., provided the plaintiff with a salary, a profit sharing plan which, among other investments, was also a limited partner in the three bowling centers, and a deferred benefit pension plan which was also a limited partner in the three bowling centers.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-6\">The stipulated judgment ordered the plaintiff to pay to the defendant lump sum alimony of $150,000, payable in installments of $50,000 by June 28, 1981, $50,000 by August 28, 1981, both of which have been paid, and $50,000 by February 28, 1982, which the plaintiff has paid into escrow pending the outcome of this appeal, together with nonmodifiable periodic alimony of $12,000 per year. The plaintiff was also ordered to pay $15,000 as part of the defendant\u2019s attorney\u2019s fees and to maintain a $50,000 life insurance policy on his life owned by the defendant and payable to her. The defendant was ordered to transfer her one <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>half interest in a business building at 636 Kings Highway, Fairfield, to the plaintiff, the equity in which he claimed was $50,000. The defendant was required to relinquish her claim in the amount of $27,000 to a certificate of deposit managed by the plaintiff. The defendant was awarded full ownership of Daniel Oil, which the plaintiff\u2019s affidavit claimed produced an income of $18,000 per year. Works of art valued by the plaintiff at $64,700 were ordered divided between the parties. Otherwise, each was to retain substantial other assets shown on their affidavits. The principal asset shown by the plaintiff\u2019s affidavit is the valuation, after taxes due on liquidation, of his pension plan in Grayson Associates, Inc., at $340,152 and the principal asset shown by the defendant\u2019s affidavit is the former family residence at 15 Berkeley Road, Westport, in which the claimed equity was $167,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-5\">On September 23,1981, the defendant moved to open the judgment rendered on May 28,1981 on the ground that the stipulated agreement was based upon a fraudulent affidavit of May 26,1981, submitted by the plaintiff to the court and to the defendant.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Extensive discovery was conducted by the defendant prior to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>dissolution and the evidentiary hearing on this matter. Depositions were taken, and the defendant used the services of an accountant, an actuary and a bowling expert. Her accountant examined records at the office of the plaintiff. The trial court, <em>Jacobson, J., </em>held hearings on the motion to open on June 1, June 2, July 27, and August 17, 1983.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-5\">The plaintiff filed a memorandum on September 1, 1983, including a requested finding of facts of twenty-three numbered paragraphs. The defendant filed no such request and did not object to the plaintiffs filing of such a request. On September 19, 1983, the court filed a memorandum of decision which adopted the plaintiffs requested findings of fact verbatim except that in paragraph nineteen there is an apparent typographical error in that the reference to the plaintiffs 1981 income should refer to his 1982 income.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b296-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>At the hearing on this appeal, the defendant did not argue that this procedure denied her a fair trial, in view <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>of the holding in <em>Cameron </em>v. <em>Avonridge, Inc., </em>3 Conn. App. 230, 235, 486 A.2d 661 (1985). The defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>claimed, however, that the present case points out the wisdom of the <em>Cameron </em>court\u2019s reference to the \u201chazards that may result from such a practice.\u201d More specifically, she argues that the findings were advocate oriented, were found without evidence, and were ambiguous.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b298-5\">The court stated in <em>Cameron </em>that \u201c[t]he plaintiffs, relying on <em>United States </em>v. <em>Forness, </em>125 F.2d 928 (2d Cir.), cert. denied sub nom. <em>City of Salamanca </em>v. <em>United States, </em>316 U.S. 694, 62 S. Ct. 1293, 86 L. Ed. 1764 (1942), claim that the trial court erred in adopting the language in the defendant\u2019s brief as its memorandum of decision. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Forness, </em>supra, 942, states that \u2018a comparison of the findings with the opinion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>seems to show that the findings proposed by the defendants were mechanically adopted, with the consequence that some of the findings made by the district court are not supported by the evidence and not substantially in accord with the opinion.\u2019 The case does not condemn the use of language in a brief of one of the parties but points out the hazards that may result. Here, the trial court specifically acknowledged in its memorandum of decision that it relied heavily on the defendant\u2019s trial brief because the facts and legal theories advanced therein were consistent with the court\u2019s views, and it did not believe that it could improve on the defendant\u2019s language. Although we do not approve of this practice, we cannot find that it resulted in less than a fair trial. Nor was there any manifest abuse of discretion or injustice. See <em>Long </em>v. <em>Schull, </em>184 Conn. 252, 257-58, 439 A.2d 975 (1981).\u201d <em>Cameron </em>v. <em>Avonridge, Inc., </em>supra, 235.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-5\">In the leading case of <em>United States </em>v. <em>Forness, </em>supra, the court, while reversing the District Court on other grounds, stated the reasons for disapproving such a practice, in part, as follows: <em>\u201cWe </em>stress this matter because of the grave importance of fact-finding. The correct finding, as near as may be, of the facts of a law suit is fully as important as the application of the correct legal rules to the facts as found. An impeccably \u2018right\u2019 legal rule applied to the \u2018wrong\u2019 facts yields a decision which is as faulty as one which results from the application of the \u2018wrong\u2019 legal rule to the \u2018right\u2019 facts. The latter type of error, indeed, can be corrected on appeal. But the former is not subject to such correction unless the appellant overcomes the heavy burden of showing that the findings of fact are \u2018clearly erroneous.\u2019 \u201d Id., 942.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-6\">\u201cIt is sometimes said that the requirement that the trial judge file findings of fact is for the convenience of the upper courts. While it does serve that end, it has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>a far more important purpose\u2014that of evoking care on the part of the trial judge in ascertaining the facts.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-5\">We can add little to this statement except to note that the practice of adopting parties\u2019 proposed findings of fact invites error or sloppy analysis on the judge\u2019s part. More importantly, the appearance of justice is just as important as the reality, and a verbatim adoption of the facts proferred by one of the advocates invites a public suspicion of the trial court\u2019s decision. The perceptions by the public and by the losing litigant of our system of justice are surely not enhanced by such a practice.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-6\">In expressing our strong disapproval of such a procedure, we in no way impugn the trial judge in this case. Counsel at the hearing on this appeal made it clear that no attack was being made on the integrity or competency of the trial judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-7\">The court in <em>Cameron </em>v. <em>Avonridge, Inc., </em>supra, noted that the trial court specifically acknowledged its heavy reliance on the defendant\u2019s trial brief in its memorandum of decision. No comment to that effect was made by the trial court in this case. Although the use of such a statement does not entirely vitiate the hazards in such a practice, it does have the very practical effect of showing that the trial court was consciously aware of the problems in this sensitive area and, presumably, that it acted in accordance with such awareness.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-8\">The propriety or impropriety of verbatim adoption is discussed in an annotation entitled \u201cFindings Prepared by Prevailing Party,\u201d 54 A.L.R.3d 868. The author points out that no reported case has been found in which the objection has met with actual success at the appellate level. Id., 870. Nor have we found any such case. We concur with the unanimous authority that verbatim adoption of the findings submitted by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>prevailing party is not, per se, a ground for finding that the losing party did not have a fair trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-5\">The issue, therefore, is whether the trial court\u2019s findings are supported by the evidence and are in substantial accord with the opinion: \u201cThe defendants finally object to the findings on the ground that they were mainly taken verbatim from the government\u2019s brief. The findings leave much to be desired in light of the function of the trial court. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Forness, </em>[supra], 942-43. But they are nonetheless the findings of the District Court. And they must stand or fall depending on whether they are supported by evidence. We think they are.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Crescent Amusements Co., </em>323 U.S. 173, 184-85, 65 S. Ct. 254, 89 L. Ed. 160 (1944). The ultimate test as to the adequacy of findings is whether they are sufficiently comprehensive and pertinent to the issues to provide a basis for the decision and whether they are supported by evidence. See <em>United Nuclear Corporation </em>v. <em>General Atomic Co., </em>96 N.M. 155, 629 P.2d 231 (1980). Although a few cases have held that the appellate court should scrutinize more carefully or give less weight to such prepackaged findings; 54 A.L.R.3d 868, 887, and supplement thereto; see <em>Garter-Bare Co. </em>v. <em>Munsingwear, Inc., </em>650 F.2d 975 (9th Cir. 1980); we do not adopt the reasoning of these few cases because a conscientious appellate court will make such examination of the record as is necessary in every case in which it is claimed that the finding is not supported by the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-6\">This court, after a meticulous examination of the parties\u2019 detailed factual claims and the entire record, has concluded that there was credible evidence for all of the court\u2019s findings and that the findings were substantially in accord with the opinion. Therefore, we find that the defendant was not denied a fair trial by the verbatim adoption of the prevailing party\u2019s proposed findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>Clear judicial guidelines exist for our task of deciding whether or not the court\u2019s judgment in this case is clearly erroneous. It is in the application of these well established principles that the difficulty arises.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-5\">Dispositions of property made at the time of the decree under General Statutes \u00a7 46b-81 are not subject to modification even if there should be a change of circumstances. General Statutes \u00a7 46b-86 (a); <em>Viglione </em>v. <em>Viglione, </em>171 Conn. 213, 215, 368 A.2d 202 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b302-6\">In dissolution actions particularly, both counsel and the court have special responsibilities with respect to agreements submitted by the parties. There must be reasonable inquiry into the wishes as well as the objective best interests of the client, and counsel have a special responsibility for full and fair disclosure and for a searching dialogue about all of the facts which materially affect the client\u2019s rights and interests. <em>Monroe </em>v. <em>Monroe, </em>177 Conn. 173, 183, 413 A.2d 819, appeal dismissed, 444 U.S. 801, 100 S. Ct. 20, 62 L. Ed. 2d 14 (1979). \u201cAlthough the law will intervene to insure that substantial justice is done where fraud has been perpetrated, the frequency and extent of this intervention must be tempered by a sometimes conflicting adjudicative proposition that mandates the ultimate conclusion of all legal controversy. Thus, the setting aside of a judgment on the basis of fraud \u2018will only be granted if the [movant] is not barred by any of the following restrictions: (1) There must have been no laches or unreasonable delay by the injured party after the fraud was discovered. (2) There must have been diligence . . . in trying to discover and expose the fraud. (3) There must be clear proof of the perjury or fraud. (4) There must be a substantial likelihood that the result of the new trial will be different. James, Civil Procedure (1965) \u00a7 11.7, pp. 540-42; [note,] 36 Ill. L. Rev. 894, 896-97 (1942).\u2019 <em>Varley </em>v. <em>Varley, </em>180 Conn. 1, 4, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>428 A.2d 317 (1980).\u201d <em>Jucker </em>v. <em>Jucker, </em>190 Conn. 674, 677, 461 A.2d 1384 (1983); see also <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>Jackson, </em>2 Conn. App. 179, 189, 478 A.2d 1026, cert. denied, 194 Conn. 805, 482 A.2d 710 (1984). We conclude that the defendant did not meet the high standard of clear proof required for fraud. Considering the other three elements set forth in <em>Varley </em>v. <em>Varley, </em>supra, we note the following: (1) there was no question of laches on the part of the defendant; (2) since we sustain the trial court\u2019s judgment that there was not clear proof of fraud, we do not reach the issues of whether or not there was diligence on the defendant\u2019s part in trying to discover and expose the fraud or a substantial likelihood that the result of the new trial would be different.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-5\">Where the parties are in agreement as to the division of the marital property and as to alimony and support, the sworn financial statements of the parties assume great significance since they are submitted in lieu of testimony under oath. Accordingly, compliance with the rules concerning the filing of financial affidavits is essential in order for the court to make a reasoned decision with respect to such orders. See <em>Winick </em>v. <em>Winick, </em>153 Conn. 294, 298, 216 A.2d 185 (1965). \u201cFraud consists in deception practised in order to induce another to part with property or surrender some legal right, and which accomplishes the end desired.\u201d <em>Alexander </em>v. <em>Church, </em>53 Conn. 561, 562, 4 A. 103 (1886), quoting Cooley, Torts, p. 474.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-6\">\u201cThe case <em>of Miller </em>v. <em>Appleby, </em>183 Conn. 51, 54-55, 438 A.2d 811 (1981), summarized the necessary elements of fraud as follows: \u2018The essential elements for an action in fraud . . . are: (1) that a false representation was made as a statement of fact; (2) that it was untrue and known to be untrue by the party making it; (3) that it was made to induce the other party to act on it; and (4) that the latter did so act on it to his injury.\u2019 \u201d <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>Jackson, </em>supra, 193. A court is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>entitled to rely upon the truth and accuracy of the sworn statements required by \u00a7 463 of the Practice Book, and a misrepresentation of assets and income is a serious and intolerable dereliction on the part of the affiant which goes to the very heart of the judicial proceeding. <em>Casanova </em>v. <em>Casanova, </em>166 Conn. 304, 305, 348 A.2d 668 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b304-5\">The defendant focused her claim of fraud in the plaintiff\u2019s affidavit on the following summary of undisputed evidence:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b304-6\">\u201cPlaintiff\u2019s Affidavit (May 26, 1981)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AEo\">Amount Received (1981)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A0j\">Amount Undisclosed (May 26, 1981)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A_af\">INCOME:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AA8Y\">Salary from Grayson Associates</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AiB\">$82,000</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AEbC\">$108,200</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ALH\">$26,200</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AbnZ\">(July 31, 1981)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ag0n\">Income from Management Fees from Georgetown Paid to Grayson Associates</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AM0\">-0-</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Act\">$42,879</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Aaj\">$42,897</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Agj\">(August 1981)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AoC\">Commission from Leslie Barth</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ANF\">-0-</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ad8d\">$15,000</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AAR\">$15,000</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A0P\">(August 1981)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AQm\">TOTAL INCOME</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ASJ\">$82,000</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AFp\">$166,079</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AJy\">$84,079</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A1U\">ASSETS:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Az4\">Georgetown at Enfield: .17% interest</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ae43\">959.76</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Afk\">8% interest</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AHA\">$46,080</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AbK\">$165,553</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AL1\">$99,553</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A9t\">(8.17% valued</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AdY\">(July 1981)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AuM\">at $66,000 gross in Plaintiffs testimony)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ABS\">TOTAL ASSETS:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AsC\">$47,039.76</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AbO\">$165,553</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AhY\">$99,553\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b305-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>In calculating the $99,553 amount, the defendant used the figure more favorable to the plaintiff, i.e., the gross value of the 8.17 percent interest testified to by the plaintiff in 1981 rather than the amount listed on his affidavit.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-5\">The defendant stresses four principal instances in which she claims that the court\u2019s findings were unsupported by, or were contrary to the evidence. First, she cites the plaintiff\u2019s statement that his 1981 income would be the same or slightly less than his 1980 income when, in fact, his income for 1981 from Grayson Associates, Inc., was $108,200 rather than the salary of $82,000 from this source shown on his affidavit. Second, she questions finding number 19 that \u201c[n]o evidence whatsoever has been offered regarding the plaintiff\u2019s 1981 or 1983 income,\u201d and the related finding, number 23, that \u201cthe plaintiff\u2019s 1981 income derived in part from an unusual set of circumstances (i.e. the Georgetown at Enfield distributions) and there is no evidence whatsoever that plaintiff\u2019s 1981 income level has ever been achieved before or since.\u201d Third, she challenges finding number 10 concerning the increase in the plaintiff\u2019s actual income over his projected income due to the payment of accrued management fees to Grayson Associates, Inc., by Georgetown at Enfield Associates in August, 1981, in the amount of $42,879, in light of the plaintiff\u2019s statement on his affidavit, in paragraph four under the heading of \u201cIncome,\u201d that \u201cno income in the future will be received from Georgetown at Enfield Associates.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b305-6\">Fourth, the defendant questions finding number 10 (c), concerning the valuation of the plaintiff\u2019s interest in Georgetown at Enfield Associates. The value listed in the affidavit was $46,080, although the defendant\u2019s summary of claimed misrepresentations used the figure of $66,000 based on the plaintiff\u2019s testimony in 1981. The plaintiff actually received $165,533 in July, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>1981, largely as a result of his taking a one half rather than a one third share in the proceeds of the payoff of a mortgage to the investors after more than 50 percent of the condominium units had been sold. The defendant argues that this chain of events demonstrates that the plaintiff controlled the distribution of proceeds and knew, when he filed the affidavit, that such a distribution would be forthcoming. The defendant has also raised several other objections to the trial court\u2019s findings which we have considered and which we conclude are without merit. Concerning the defendant\u2019s specific challenges to the court\u2019s findings as described above we conclude as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b306-5\">(1) Concerning the plaintiff\u2019s 1981 income from Grayson Associates, Inc., in the amount of $108,200, we note that Grayson Associates, Inc.\u2019s tax return was filed on a fiscal year basis ending July 31, 1981, and the plaintiff was on a calendar tax year. The court found, in finding number 10 (b) that this larger income was due to an increase in fees for the management of the three bowling centers, proposed by the plaintiff in September, 1981, and subsequently agreed to by 100 limited partners. The defendant questions how a September, 1981 increase could account for a larger payout from Grayson Associates, Inc., as of July 31,1981. The defendant is correct that this is a questionable finding. Our review of the transcript reveals testimony of Martin Ruffkess, C.P.A., which would largely attribute this increase to the reimbursement, earlier than had been the practice in the past, to Grayson Associates, Inc., from the bowling alleys for amounts advanced for resurfacing the alleys. We conclude, however, that this questioned finding does not shake the underpinning of the court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-6\">(2) The court\u2019s finding number 19, that no evidence whatsoever has been offered regarding the plaintiff\u2019s 1981 (the parties agree this should read 1982) and 1983 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>income, was not entirely correct. The plaintiffs exhibit 15, the 1982 tax return of Grayson Associates, Inc., shows a salary to the plaintiff of $106,000. This deficiency in the finding is not a substantial one since the court\u2019s corollary finding, that there was no evidence that the plaintiff\u2019s 1981 income had ever been achieved before or since, is substantially supported in the record if \u201cincome\u201d is taken in its ordinary sense to be money received from all sources, including capital, which amount the defendant herself claims was $166,079 in 1981 rather than the $82,000 shown on plaintiff\u2019s affidavit.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-5\">(3) The claim concerning misrepresentation in the statement on the plaintiff\u2019s affidavit that no income in the future will be received from Georgetown at Enfield is the most serious challenge to the evidentiary underpinning of the court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-6\">The defendant points out that finding 10 (a), concerning management fees paid by Georgetown at Enfield to Grayson Associates, Inc., states only that \u201cthe fees were fully disclosed in financial statements available to the defendant at the time of trial, but the date of payment of which was unknown at the time of trial, as it depended on the acts of third parties.\u201d The defendant stresses that the finding did not say that the plaintiff did not know the amount to which he was entitled but only that he did not know the date of the payment.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-7\">The statement on the plaintiff\u2019s affidavit that no income in the future will be received from Georgetown at Enfield Associates is misleading, at best, in the light of the court\u2019s failure to find that the management fees later received by the plaintiff were not known to him on May 25,1981. The defendant apparently argues that such a categorical misstatement in an affidavit is a mandatory basis for opening the judgment on the ground of fraud, regardless of the defendant\u2019s other knowledge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>concerning the matter gleaned from extensive discovery by the defendant. Two considerations dispose of this argument. Although the defendant is correct in pointing out the court\u2019s omission and the reasonable implication to be drawn from this, that the plaintiff knew on May 25, 1981, of the increased payments to be made to him, she failed to move to articulate the memorandum of decision under Practice Book \u00a7 3082 concerning the issue involved. <em>In re Juvenile Appeal (85-1), </em>3 Conn. App. 158, 161, 485 A.2d 1355 (1985). More significantly, we decline to adopt a rule that any misrepresentation in an affidavit, if it be one, automatically requires a finding of fraud on the court\u2019s part. The legal framework for consideration of such a fraud claim has been carefully delineated in the cases cited above. Here, the court stressed the defendant\u2019s detailed knowledge of the Georgetown at Enfield situation. It was for the court to decide, on the basis of the totality of the circumstances, whether or not there was clear proof of fraud under the criteria referred to.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-5\">(4) Finding number 13 provides that \u201cthe plaintiff did not know on May 26, 1981 that the distributions listed in [finding] 10 above [concerning Georgetown at Enfield] would occur in calendar year 1981, nor was he able to predict with reasonable certainty what the precise amounts of those distributions would be.\u201d Once again the finding stressed the defendant\u2019s knowledge of the Georgetown at Enfield mortgage. Further, the defendant points out that the court did not find that the plaintiff did not know, on May 26,1981, of further distributions coming from Georgetown at Enfield. The same comment as previously made concerning her failure to file a motion to articulate the memorandum of decision is pertinent at this point.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-6\">The claim that this finding undermines the court\u2019s conclusion of the absence of fraud is without merit. When it is confined to the equity distribution at George<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>town at Enfield there is substantial credible evidence in the record to sustain such a finding. Here, we are faced, not with a categorical statement akin to \u201cno income in the future will be received,\u201d but rather with the statement on the plaintiffs affidavit about \u201cequity to be received in the future\u201d at a figure which turned out to be substantially less than that actually received.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-5\">Overall, the defendant\u2019s claim of fraud is based on occurrences after the dissolution which resulted in substantially larger income to the plaintiff than his affidavit indicated could be expected. Since there is no direct proof of such fraud, her case necessarily rests on inferences which she claims the court should have drawn from the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-6\">There is certainly present in this case a high degree of suspicion that the plaintiff, on May 26, 1981, contemplated or had prearranged the larger payments. The plaintiff\u2019s business structure and experience as a sophisticated businessman made it possible for him to pump up the financial pipelines to his benefit. Mere speculation or suspicion as to such an inference is not, however, sufficient to mandate a finding of clear evidence of fraud. It is axiomatic that the credibility of witnesses, the finding of facts, and the drawing of inferences are all in the trier\u2019s province. \u201cIt is futile to assign error involving the weight of testimony or the credibility of witnesses.\u201d <em>Slattery </em>v. <em>Maykut, </em>176 Conn. 147, 149, 405 A.2d 76 (1978); see also <em>Piantedosi </em>v. <em>Floridia, </em>186 Conn. 275, 277, 440 A.2d 977 (1982); <em>Filosi </em>v. <em>Hawkins, </em>1 Conn. App. 634, 641, 474 A.2d 1261 (1984); <em>Zolan, Bernstein, Dworken &amp; Klein </em>v. <em>Milone, </em>1 Conn. App. 43, 46, 467 A.2d 938 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b309-7\">From our appellate perch, the temptation to second guess the trial court\u2019s factual conclusions is very seductive. We must be ever mindful, however, of our limited role in such a case. We must not operate as some sort <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>of judicial piranha nibbling away at the court\u2019s findings. The question is not whether this court might have reached the same conclusion concerning the subordinate facts found or reasonable inferences therefrom but whether the trial court could not reasonably have concluded as it did. We conclude that there was sufficient credible evidence to justify the trial court\u2019s finding of subordinate facts and that the finding of no clear evidence of fraud was not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-5\">The defendant strenuously argues that the case of <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>Jackson, 2 </em>Conn. App. 179, 478 A.2d 1026 (1984), supports her position. The defendant claims that her case is even stronger than that of the successful appellant in <em>Jackson </em>wherein the court found that the trial court\u2019s refusal to open the dissolution judgment on the ground of fraud was clearly erroneous. In <em>Jackson, </em>the defendant had stipulated to a dissolution judgment in the mistaken belief that she was to get slightly less than one half of what the plaintiff\u2019s affidavit represented was 4277 shares of stock in C 3, Inc. In fact, during the negotiations leading to the stipulation, the plaintiff had received a three-for-one stock split so that at the time of the dissolution he owned 12,831 shares rather than the 4277 shares shown on his affidavit. This split was unknown to the defendant despite due diligence on the part of her and her attorney. As a result, the defendant received one sixth of the stock worth approximately $400,000, rather than almost exactly one half of it. The court in <em>Jackson </em>noted that the disparity in the division of the stock was very substantial. Id., 181. This was particularly so in view of the very modest other financial arrangements of the parties.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b311-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>The defendant misreads <em>Jackson </em>as it relates to this case. In <em>Jackson, </em>the court\u2019s decision reversing the trial court\u2019s finding of no fraud grew out of very compelling evidence to the contrary. The three-for-one stock certificates in the plaintiff husband\u2019s hands constituted the \u201csmoking gun\u201d of fraud practiced by the plaintiff in his affidavit <em>at the time of the dissolution. </em>It was crystal clear that Mr. Jackson knew Mrs. Jackson did not know of the stock split because before the final stipulation leading to the dissolution she wrote to her lawyer asking him to try to get 2138 of the shares rather than 2000 shares because 2138 shares represented more exactly one half of the plaintiff\u2019s stock. Id., 185. The <em>Jackson </em>case reeked of fraud, unlike the case here.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-5\">The defendant in this case is attempting to move <em>Jackson </em>to the next plateau. She seeks a holding that the trier must infer that prior knowledge of financially favorable events which occur soon after the filing of a party\u2019s financial affidavit existed at the time of the filing. Although a trial court may, upon review of all of the facts, including the fact of a party\u2019s rapid improvement in financial condition, conclude that fraud was present as of the date of dissolution, the trial court did not do so here. Such a fact, standing alone, carries no mandatory inference.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-6\">We must steer a careful course between the Scylla of <em>Jucker </em>v. <em>Jucker, </em>190 Conn. 674, 461 A.2d 1384 (1983), where the court sustained the trial court\u2019s finding of no fraud, and the Charybdis of <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>Jackson, </em>supra, where the fraud leaped out of the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-7\">To do so, we must balance two fundamental principles of law. We are well aware of the limited role of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>this court in reviewing factual findings of the trial court, particularly in domestic cases. \u201cA factual finding may be rejected by this court only if it is \u2018clearly erroneous.\u2019 Practice Book \u00a7 3060D.\u201d <em>Kaplan </em>v. <em>Kaplan, </em>186 Conn. 387, 392, 441 A.2d 629 (1982). The trier of fact has wide latitude in its interpretation of the evidence and the conclusions to be drawn therefrom. \u201c \u2018[TJrial courts have a distinct advantage over an appellate court in dealing with domestic relations, where all of the surrounding circumstances and the appearance and attitude of the parties are so significant.\u2019 \u201d <em>Figlar </em>v. <em>Figlar, </em>174 Conn. 151, 153, 384 A.2d 1 (1978). \u201cThis court may not substitute its own opinion . . . for the factual finding of the trial court.\u201d <em>Kaplan </em>v. <em>Kaplan, </em>supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-5\">\u201cWe are equally aware of the danger of opening the floodgates to a wave of motions to open dissolution judgments by dissatisfied litigants. Where, as in this case, however, a clear case is made under applicable law that a fraudulent and material misrepresentation by one party resulted in a substantial injustice to the other party, we must not hesitate to act. This is such a case.\u201d <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>Jackson, </em>supra, 196.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-6\">In view of the necessary deference to the findings of the trial court in dissolution cases and the companion need for finality in judgments, we conclude that this is not such a case. The judgment of the trial court was not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-7\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-8\">In this opinion Dupont, C.P.J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b292-8\"> The defendant also briefed the issue of whether the trial court utilized a different standard in weighing her testimony as opposed to that of the plaintiff. We conclude that this claim is without merit.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b294-6\"> Pertinent parts of the plaintiff\u2019s affidavit of May 26, 1981, provide:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AkLA\">\u201cI.

I dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-10\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b312-11\">I would apply to the \u201cfindings\u201d of the trial court in this case a more exacting standard than employed by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>the majority. I would, as some jurisdictions have done, apply a test of strict scrutiny. See, e.g., <em>Garter-Bare Co. </em>v. <em>Munsingwear, Inc., </em>650 F.2d 975 (9th Cir. 1980) and cases cited therein; annot., 54 A.L.R.3d 868, 887-88. This standard of review of the trial court\u2019s factual determinations requires more than deciding, as we normally do under a \u201cclearly erroneous\u201d standard, whether the findings are supported by some credible evidence. It requires us to make \u201ca scrupulous examination of the record to ascertain whether such . . . finding[s] [are] <em>supported by substantial evidence.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Zayas, </em>3 Conn. App. 289, 297, 489 A.2d 380 (1985). I would employ this heightened standard in this case because of a coalescence of three factors: the important purposes of factual findings of a trial court; the fact that this is a marital dissolution case; and the way in which these findings were adopted and expressed.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-5\">First, as the majority recognizes, <em>United States </em>v. <em>Forness, </em>125 F.2d 928 (2d Cir.), cert. denied sub nom. <em>City of Salamanca </em>v. <em>United States, </em>316 U.S. 694, 62 S. Ct. 1293, 86 L. Ed. 1764 (1942), in an opinion authored by Judge Jerome Frank and joined by Judges Augustus Hand and Charles Clark, identified the two central purposes of requiring a trial judge to file factual findings: to facilitate appellate review; and to ensure that the trial judge takes care in ascertaining the facts. \u201cIt is sometimes said that the requirement that the trial judge file findings of fact is for the convenience of the upper courts. While it does serve that end, it has a far more important purpose\u2014that of evoking care on the part of the trial judge in ascertaining the facts. For, as every judge knows, to set down in precise words the facts as he finds them is the best way to avoid carelessness in the discharge of that duty: Often a strong impression that, on the basis of the evidence, the facts are thus-and-so gives way when it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>comes to expressing that impression on paper. The trial court is the most important agency of the judicial branch of the government precisely because on it rests the responsibility of ascertaining the facts. When a . . . trial judge sits without a jury, that responsibility is his. And it is not a light responsibility since, unless his findings are 'clearly erroneous/ no upper court may disturb them. To ascertain the facts is not a mechanical act. It is a difficult art, not a science. It involves skill and judgment. As fact-finding is a human undertaking, it can, of course, never be perfect and infallible. For that very reason every effort should be made to render it as adequate as it humanly can be.\u201d Id., 942-43; see also <em>International Controls Corporation </em>v. <em>Vesco, </em>490 F.2d 1334, 1341 n.6 (2d Cir. 1974), cert. denied, 417 U.S. 932, 94 S. Ct. 2644, 41 L. Ed. 2d 236 (1974) (disapproving and \u201croundly condemning]\u201d trial judge\u2019s adoption in toto of factual findings submitted by counsel).</p>\n<p id=\"b314-5\">Second, this is a marital dissolution case. Few, if any, judicial proceedings match such a case for emotion-laden content. \u201cAnalogies drawn from commercial litigation fail to respond adequately to the situation of emotional trauma commonly associated with the irretrievable breakdown of a marriage.\u201d <em>Monroe </em>v. <em>Monroe, </em>177 Conn. 173, 182, 413 A.2d 819, appeal dismissed, 444 U.S. 801, 100 S. Ct. 20, 62 L. Ed. 2d 14 (1979). It \u201cput[s] two persons, who once shared life\u2019s tenderest intimacies, in a position of combat.\u201d <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>Jackson, </em>2 Conn. App. 179, 186-87, 478 A.2d 1026 (1984). These considerations compel the conclusion that, perhaps more than in other types of cases, in marital cases \u201cthe continued vitality of our judicial system rests in part on the continued perception on the part of its participants of the basic fairness of its procedures.\u201d <em>Gennarini </em>v. <em>Gennarini, </em>2 Conn. App. 132, 138, 477 A.2d 674 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b315-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>Because of these considerations, a trilogy of our precedents has established the principle that, in the settlement of marital disputes, full and frank disclosure of essential facts is required among all the participants in the process: counsel, clients and court. In <em>Monroe </em>v. <em>Monroe, </em>supra, 183, the Supreme Court emphasized the need for that disclosure between counsel and client. In <em>Baker </em>v. <em>Baker, </em>187 Conn. 315, 445 A.2d 912 (1982), that court applied the principle to the disclosures required between the litigants and their counsel, on one hand, and the court on the other. Not long ago, this court applied the same principle to the requirements of disclosure between the adversary sides. \u201cOnly full and frank disclosure can facilitate such settlements. Whatever the situation may be in contested dissolution actions, there should be at least a Geneva Convention of rules of war where the parties are able to work out the matter themselves.\u201d <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>Jackson, </em>supra, 188.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-5\">The reasons for this principle are obvious. It is essential to the implementation of our strong policy that the \u201cprivate settlement of the financial affairs of estranged marital partners is a goal that courts should support rather than undermine.\u201d <em>Baker </em>v. <em>Baker, </em>supra, 322; <em>Hayes </em>v. <em>Beresford, </em>184 Conn. 558, 568, 440 A.2d 224 (1981); <em>Lavigne </em>v. <em>Lavigne, </em>3 Conn. App. 423, 426, 488 A.2d 1290 (1985). Our support of that goal will be effective only if we instill confidence in marital litigants that we require, as a concomitant of the settlement process, such full and frank disclosure from both sides, for then they will be more willing to forego their combat and to settle their dispute privately, secure in the knowledge that they have all the essential information. In addition, this principle of disclosure facilitates the task of the court to ensure that settlement agreements are substantively fair and knowingly negotiated. <em>Baker </em>v. <em>Baker, </em>supra, 321. Finally, and most poignantly, the settlement of a marital dissolution case is not like the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>settlement of an accident case. It stamps with finality the end of a marriage. \u201cMarriage is a coming together for better or for worse, hopefully enduring, and intimate to the degree of being sacred. It is an association that promotes a way of life, not causes; a harmony in living, not political faiths; a bilateral loyalty, not commercial or social projects.\u201d <em>Griswold </em>v. <em>Connecticut, </em>381 U.S. 479, 486, 85 S. Ct. 1678, 14 L. Ed. 2d 510 (1965). Courts simply should not countenance either party to such a unique human relationship dealing with the other at arms\u2019 length. Whatever honesty there may, or should, have been during the marriage should at least be required by the court at its end.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-5\">These are the teachings of our cases. They represent the distilled wisdom of most judges who have presided over such unhappy proceedings. The approach of the majority in this case is an unfortunate step back from the sunshine of those teachings. I cannot square that approach with the clear step which this court so wisely took in <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>Jackson, </em>supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-6\">Third, unlike <em>Cameron </em>v. <em>Avonridge, Inc., </em>3 Conn. App. 230, 235, 486 A.2d 661 (1985), here the trial court mechanically adopted all the proposed findings of the plaintiff and added none of its own, without any recognition in its memorandum of decision that it was doing so and without any explanation for such a radical departure from the norm of the judicial process. Indeed, following a hearing lasting four days, it filed its memorandum of decision within eighteen days after the plaintiff submitted his posthearing brief, an alacrity of decision making which, under other circumstances, would be admirable, given the heavy caseload under which our trial court judges labor. It adopted verbatim the twenty-three critical paragraphs of facts articulated by the plaintiff, apparently without even proofreading them for improper grammar or misspelling. See footnote 3 to the majority opinion: finding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>number 8 (\u201cby a certified public account\u201d); finding number 20 (\u201cThe defendent\u2019s\u201d); finding number 21 (\u201cDefendent\u2019s\u201d); and finding number 22 (\u201cDefendent\u201d). It adopted the plaintiff\u2019s proposed findings <em>in toto, </em>a practice which persuasive and respected judicial authority has \u201cexpressly disapproved.\u201d <em>Apex Oil Co. </em>v. <em>Vanguard Oil &amp; Service Co., </em>760 F.2d 417, 421-22 (2d Cir. 1985) (Newman, J.), citing <em>International Controls Corporation </em>v. <em>Vesco, </em>supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-5\">Such a process can only foster in the litigants\u2019 minds deep skepticism that the findings of the trial judge were truly \u201c \u2018the product of the workings of [his] mind . . . .\u2019\u201d <em>Apex Oil Co. </em>v. <em>Vanguard Oil &amp; Service Co., </em>supra, 422. This can only undermine the marital litigants\u2019 perception of the basic fairness of the process by which their claims were decided, a perception which is essential to the continued vitality of our judicial system. <em>Gennarini </em>v. <em>Gennarini, </em>supra, 138. Therefore, we as an appellate court have an obligation to review the results of that process with strict scrutiny, so as to attempt to redress that perceived unfairness.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-6\">I disagree with the basis of the majority\u2019s rejection of the strict scrutiny standard, namely, that a conscientious appellate court will always scrupulously examine the trial court record. The issue is not whether we scrupulously examine the record. The issue involves the standard by which we gauge what that examination yields. I believe that, under the unique circumstances of this case, we should require that the findings be supported, not just by some credible evidence, but by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-7\">We are quite accustomed to applying that more exacting scope of review of factual determinations of the trial court when strong reasons of policy demand it. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Zayas, </em>3 Conn. App. 289, 297, 489 A.2d 380 (1985) (record upon which finding of waiver of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number><em>Miranda </em>rights based must be scrupulously examined to ascertain whether finding supported by substantial evidence); see also <em>Jazlowiecki </em>v. <em>Cyr, </em>4 Conn. App. 76, 78, 492 A.2d 516 (1985) (\u201ccharge of judicial bias or prejudice strikes at the very core of judicial integrity and requires that the record be examined with infinite care\u201d).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> This standard is a useful tool of the appellate trade, when supported by strong reasons of policy. The circumstances of this case compel its use.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b318-6\">Applying the strict scrutiny standard to the \u201cfindings\u201d of the trial court, I conclude that they do not pass muster. It would serve little purpose in this dissent to go through them item by item and compare them to the evidence, as the majority has done. Indeed, even the majority views three of the four challenged factual determinations of the trial court as \u201cquestionable,\u201d \u201cnot entirely correct\u201d and \u201cmisleading at best,\u201d and the majority, even from its \u201cappellate perch,\u201d perceives \u201ca high degree of suspicion\u201d about the plaintiff\u2019s truthfulness in his financial affidavit. Despite the Herculean effort of the majority to insert a firm foundation under an already crumbling edifice, I am persuaded that critical findings are not supported by substantial evidence, and that a new hearing is warranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-7\">I would, therefore, find error and remand the case for a new hearing on the defendant\u2019s motion to open the judgment.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b318-8\"> Likewise, we are equally capable of subjecting, in appropriate circumstances, factual determinations of the trial court to a less critical eye than is the norm. See <em>Babiarz </em>v. <em>Hartford, Special, Inc., </em>2 Conn. App. 388, 480 A.2d 561 (1984).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
