He appeals from the trial court\u2019s judgment suspending him from practicing law for a three month period for violating Disciplinary Rule 9-102 of the Code of Professional Responsibility and reprimanding him for conduct indicating neglect and inattention to legal matters entrusted to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-11\">The presentment to the trial court of the defendant for misconduct by the plaintiff grievance committee was in two counts. The defendant claims that the trial court erred in considering and disciplining the defendant on the contents of the second count of the presentment because it referred both to previous complaints filed with, investigated and resolved by the grievance committee short of presentments to the Superior Court and, in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>some instances, to complaints which had been dismissed by the committee because of a lack of a finding of unprofessional or unethical conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-5\">A complaint against an attorney which has previously been dismissed by a grievance committee may be disclosed and used in connection with presentments to the Superior Court of that attorney. <em>In re Herman N. Horwitz, </em>21 Conn. Sup. 363, 154 A.2d 878 (1959).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b188-6\">The defendant also argues that the trial court exceeded its judicial discretion by suspending him from practicing law for three months. The facts show that his actions clearly violated Disciplinary Rule 9-102<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>the Code of Professional Responsibility. The trial court\u2019s action will not be set aside unless the defendant has in some substantial way been deprived of his rights. <em>Grievance Committee of the Bar of New Haven County </em>v. <em>Sinn, </em>128 Conn. 419, 422, 23 A.2d 516 (1941); <em>In re Durant, </em>80 Conn. 140, 150, 67 A. 497 (1907).
