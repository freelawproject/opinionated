(Pomponio). The trial court rendered summary judgment for the town.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The plaintiff appealed. We find error in the form of the judgment only, because we conclude that the plaintiff has no standing and that, therefore, its complaint against the town should be dismissed.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b200-7\">The town reserved the right to reject any or all bids, and to accept the bid which, in its judgment, was in its best interests. The plaintiffs bid of $941,000 was the second lowest. Pomponio\u2019s bid of $844,996 was the lowest. The day after the opening of the bids, Pomponio discovered that it had made a unilateral mistake by inadvertently omitting the cost of one item of $66,000 and notified the town. The selectmen of the town concluded that the claim of mistake was corroborated, and entered into negotiations with Pomponio.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> After consulting with its attorneys, the town awarded the contract to Pomponio for $900,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>It is clear that the plaintiff has fallen far short of establishing \u201cfraud, corruption or acts undermining the objective and integrity of the [competitive] bidding process . . . <em>Ardmare Construction Co. </em>v. <em>Freedman, </em>191 Conn. 497, 504-505, 467 A.2d 674 (1983).
