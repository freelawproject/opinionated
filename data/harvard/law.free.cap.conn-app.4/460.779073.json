This judgment was rendered after the plaintiff moved for summary judgment against the defendants George R. Macri and Julia S. Macri,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> which the trial court granted. The plaintiff conceded at oral argument, and the record discloses, that a reply to the special defense interposed by those defendants had not been filed when the trial court decided the motion. Practice Book \u00a7 379 provides that a party may not move for summary judgment against any party to which the motion is directed until the pleadings are closed as to those parties. See <em>Doublewal Corporation </em>v. <em>Toffolon, </em>195 Conn. 384, 391, 488 A.2d 444 (1985). The trial court here granted the motion for summary judgment before the pleadings were closed.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-5\">There is error, the judgment is set aside and the case is remanded for further proceedings.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b477-10\"> The other defendants in this action were defaulted for failure to appear or for failure to disclose a defense or for failing to plead. Thereafter, judgment against those defendants was sought and granted.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
