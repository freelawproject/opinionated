Basically, she claims that the trial court erred in failing to charge the jury properly with reference to certain remarks made by counsel for one of the defendants during his closing argument. We find no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-9\">The plaintiff brought this action seeking damages for injuries which she allegedly received as the result of a fall on premises owned by the named defendant and his wife, and leased by the defendant C. J. Fortiokis. After all the parties had rested, they made final argument, none of which was recorded.
