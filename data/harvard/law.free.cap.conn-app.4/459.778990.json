In addition, the trial court permitted the defendant wife to retain her vested pension, her savings bonds and stocks, her savings and checking account, and other items of personalty. In addition to the $10,000 note, the trial court permitted the plaintiff husband to retain his ownership in two automobiles, a check for approximately $500 and any personalty presently in his possession or control. The plaintiff husband appealed that judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-11\">On appeal, the plaintiff challenges the trial court\u2019s assignment of the marital property.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Connecticut\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>appellate courts have repeatedly, evidently to no avail, indicated that the scope of appellate review in domestic relations is limited to determining whether the trial court could reasonably conclude , as it did. <em>Thode </em>v. <em>Thode, </em>190 Conn. 694, 699, 462 A.2d 4 (1983); <em>Sweet </em>v. <em>Sweet, </em>190 Conn. 657, 664, 462 A.2d 1031 (1983); <em>Carpenter </em>v. <em>Carpenter, </em>188 Conn. 736, 741-42, 453 A.2d 1151 (1982); <em>Szilagyi </em>v. <em>Szilagyi, </em>3 Conn.
