We find error.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-8\">On December 22,1970, the plaintiffs, Dominick and Freida Montano, executed a promissory note in the amount of $35,000, secured by a mortgage on their real property, in favor of Hartford National Bank. This note was made at the request of their son, Donald Montano, who was an officer and shareholder in the defendant Kin-Therm, Inc. The president of Kin-Therm and Donald Montano both signed the note as guarantors. The $35,000 was then loaned by the plaintiffs to Kin-Therm pursuant to a separate note.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-9\">On March 5, 1971, Kin-Therm filed for bankruptcy, listing its note to the plaintiffs, and its guaranty of the plaintiffs debt to Hartford National Bank as unsecured debts. As a result of Kin-Therm\u2019s bankruptcy, the plaintiffs received $5512.50 in discharge of their claim.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Kin-Therm\u2019s assets and stock were subsequently purchased by Applied Energy Company, Inc., which continued to employ Donald Montano as manager of its operations. Donald Montano thereafter made weekly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>cash payments to his parents which, the trial court found, \u201croughly corresponded to interest on the balance of the plaintiffs\u2019 loss.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b203-5\">The plaintiffs brought this action, in two counts, alleging that both defendants had agreed to hold them harmless on the Hartford National Bank note. The court held that there was insufficient evidence upon which to find that either defendant had made such an agreement with the plaintiffs. The court concluded, however, that the cash payments were made pursuant to an oral agreement between the plaintiffs and Kin-Therm, which agreement constituted a post-bankruptcy reaffirmation of debt. Thus, despite the fact that the defendants asserted that they were discharged of this debt by their bankruptcy, the court concluded that the plaintiffs should recover on the basis of the post-bankruptcy reaffirmation although the court expressly acknowledged that \u201cthe plaintiffs did not raise [this issue] in their pleadings.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b203-6\">The defendants\u2019 fundamental claim of error<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> is that the trial court erred in finding a post-bankruptcy reaffirmation of Kin-Therm\u2019s debt to the plaintiffs in the absence of pleadings raising that as an issue. The trial court acknowledged that \u201cmatters in avoidance of affirmative allegations in an answer generally have to be specially pleaded in the reply.\u201d That court went on to state, however, that \u201csuch a defect may be treated as waived when it appears that the defendant was aware of this claim, as evidenced by the considerable amount of testimony presented by both parties on this issue. See <em>Frager </em>v. <em>Pennsylvania General Ins. Co., </em>161 Conn. [472, 289 A.2d 896] (1971).\u201d The trial court\u2019s reliance on <em>Frager, </em>however, is misplaced. That case involved a special defense which was not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>properly raised in proceedings after a remand by the Supreme Court. See <em>Frager </em>v. <em>Pennsylvania General Ins. Co., </em>155 Conn. 270, 231 A.2d 531 (1967). The court specifically noted that in the proceedings which had led to its earlier remand, the claim in question had been raised so that the plaintiff had notice of it. <em>Frager </em>v. <em>Pennsylvania General Ins. Co., </em>161 Conn. 472, 478, 289 A.2d 896 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b204-5\">The present case, on the other hand, involved issues which required evidence of a post-bankruptcy reaffirmation of debt as well as of the claims raised by the pleadings. Waiver of an appropriate pleading cannot be found in the admission of evidence relevant to issues within the scope of the pleadings simply because that evidence also pertains to issues not before the court. \u201cA failure to demur, or to object to the evidence offered to prove the facts found [but not averred], does not preclude the losing party from asserting and taking advantage of the error on appeal.\u201d <em>Stein </em>v. <em>Coleman, </em>73 Conn. 524, 529, 48 A. 206 (1901); <em>State </em>v. <em>Porrot, </em>4 Conn. Cir. Ct. 400, 403, 233 A.2d 13 (1967). In fact, the defendants did object to the admission of evidence which was relevant to the reaffirmation issue, stating specifically that \u201cif the purpose is to attempt to prove that there was some agreement where Kin-Therm reaffirmed the debt, I\u2019m going to object to that on the basis that it is nowhere in the pleadings.\u201d That objection was overruled and an exception was taken. Thus, the defendants did everything necessary to keep the proceedings from straying outside the bounds of the pleadings.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-6\">\u201cThe purpose of the complaint is to limit the issues to be decided at the trial of a case and is calculated to prevent surprise. <em>Board of Education </em>v. <em>Commission on Human Rights &amp; Opportunities, </em>177 Conn. 75, 77, 411 A.2d 40 (1979); <em>Lundberg </em>v. <em>Kovacs, </em>172 Conn. 229, 232, 374 A.2d 201 (1977). It is fundamental in our law that the right of a plaintiff to recover is limited to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>allegations in his complaint. <em>Kawasaki Kisen Kaisha, Ltd. </em>v. <em>Indomar, Ltd., </em>173 Conn. 269, 272, 377 A.2d 316 (1977); <em>Strimiska </em>v. <em>Yates, </em>158 Conn. 179, 185, 257 A.2d 814 (1969); <em>Nash Engineering Co. </em>v. <em>Norwalk, </em>137 Conn. 235, 239, 75 A.2d 496 (1950). \u2018A plaintiff may not allege one cause of action and recover upon another. Facts found but not averred cannot be made the basis for a recovery.\u2019 <em>Malone </em>v. <em>Steinberg, </em>138 Conn. 718, 721, 89 A.2d 213 (1952); <em>Schaller </em>v. <em>Roadside Inn, Inc., </em>154 Conn. 61, 65, 221 A.2d 263 (1966).\u201d <em>Francis </em>v. <em>Hollauer, </em>1 Conn. App. 693, 694-95, 475 A.2d 326 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b205-5\">There is error, the judgment is set aside and the case is remanded with direction to render judgment for the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-6\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b202-10\"> Kin-Therm, Inc., is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Applied Energy Company, Inc., which is also a defendant herein.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b202-11\"> In the interim, the plaintiffs had repaid Hartford National Bank in full.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b203-7\"> Although the defendants\u2019 brief sets out three claims of error, those claims are all predicated on the trial court\u2019s decision as to the issue of reaffirmation.
