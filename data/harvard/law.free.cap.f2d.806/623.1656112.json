We reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-8\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b725-9\">Facts &amp; Background</p>\n<p id=\"b725-10\">From 1979 through January 1984, plaintiff James Edward Jackson attended special education classes, pursuant to the Education of Handicapped Children Act (EHA), 20 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1401-1454 (1978 &amp; Supp.1986), in defendant Franklin County School System. In 1984, when this suit was filed, James was sixteen years old and handicapped with a learning disability; he was described at trial as functioning on approximately the third-grade level.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-11\">In late January 1984, James and two friends apparently accosted several female classmates. He was subsequently suspended for three days. Before the three-day suspension expired, delinquency charges were filed against James in the Youth Court of Franklin County, Mississippi. The Youth Court, with his mother\u2019s consent, sent James to East Mississippi State Hospital for evaluation and treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-14\">On April 9, 1984, James returned home from the State hospital and made an effort to return to school. However, the record does not illuminate very clearly what transpired at this time. Dr. Aleta Schexnay-der, the director of Franklin\u2019s special education programs, testified that in April she spoke with Donna Miller, James\u2019 social worker, informing her that this was not the best time for James to return to school. Dr. Schexnayder based this conclusion on several factors, including her belief that James\u2019 safety might be endangered, concern for other students\u2019 safety, and the fact that only a month of school remained, with exams beginning in about a week. Ms. Miller did not testify, but purportedly concurred with this opinion. Apparently, Dr. Schexnayder believed Ms. Miller was speaking with and acting on behalf of James and his mother. According to Mrs. Thompson\u2019s testimony, although she did not contact , any school officials, she told Ms. Miller, \u201cher representative,\u201d that she wanted James to go back to school. At no time did Dr. Schexnayder attempt to speak with or provide notice to Mrs. Thompson regarding the decision to withhold educational services from James.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-15\">On August 20, 1984, the first day of the fall term, Ms. Miller called Dr. Schexnay-der inquiring about James\u2019 status. Dr. Schexnayder said James would need a new Individual Education Program (IEP) before enrolling, and also there was some problem because James was supposed to go before the Youth Court upon his return from the State hospital, but he had not yet done so. Dr. Schexnayder and James\u2019 principal seemed to believe that somehow the Youth Court matter precluded James\u2019 attendance at school, but no one at the school made any effort to discuss this issue with the Youth Court judge or otherwise investigate the validity of this assumption.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Apparent<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number>ly Ms. Miller and Dr. Schexnayder had several conversations at the beginning of September regarding James\u2019 status, and Dr. Schexnayder testified that she relayed Ms. Miller\u2019s concerns to the school board. Nonetheless, school officials continued to refuse to discuss development of an IEP, or regular class attendance, until the Youth Court matter was resolved.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-4\">Sometime around September 12, 1984, Mrs. Thompson filed a complaint with the State Department of Education. On September 19, Dr. Schexnayder responded to this complaint, citing the Youth Court matter as the reason for James\u2019 continued exclusion from school.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Mrs. Thompson subsequently spoke with Mr. Larry Jones, superintendent of the Franklin County School System, but to no avail. Finally, Mrs. Thompson sought legal assistance and on September 24, she filed suit claiming a deprivation of James\u2019 due process rights, and seeking a court order readmitting her son to school.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b726-5\">On October 19, Franklin School officials notified Mrs. Thompson of an IEP conference to be held on October 23. School officials still had not received any information regarding settlement of the Youth Court matter, but nevertheless decided to develop an IEP for James. Mrs. Thompson did not attend the October 23 meeting. Subsequently, the IEP conference was rescheduled to October 31 to obtain her participation.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-11\">At the IEP conference Dr. Schexnayder explained that there were four priorities for James: (1) counseling and in-depth treatment; (2) vocational training; (3) academic preparation; and (4) strict supervision. After some discussion it became apparent that Franklin School officials believed a residential placement would be in James\u2019 best interest. Contrariwise, Mrs. Thompson rejected any placement options that would take James away from home, because, she said, she needed him for chores and protection around the house. Unable to resolve their differences, the conference ended with the school recommending residential placement. On December 13, 1984, a due process hearing was held to review this determination, and following a hearing the school board\u2019s decision was upheld. During the appeals process, Mrs. Thompson has rejected all alternative placements for James, insisting on her son\u2019s return to the special education classes he previously attended in Franklin County; <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> during these two years of legal bat-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"627\">*627</page-number>ties, James has received no public education.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-5\">On this appeal, James does not question the appropriateness of the educational placement recommended at the IEP conference. Instead, he argues that the magistrate erred in not finding that his due process rights were violated by being excluded from school in the spring of 1984, and the first two months of school the following fall. Believing that \u201cthe invaluable school time [James] lost ... cannot be replaced,\u201d the plaintiffs seek monetary damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b727-7\">Although the right to an education arises not from the Constitution, but through legislation, it nevertheless is one of the most cherished and ardently protected of all rights. Indeed, \u201ceducation is perhaps the most important function of state and local governments.\u201d <em>Brown v. Board of Education, </em>347 U.S. 483, 493, 74 S.Ct. 686, 691, 98 L.Ed. 873 (1954). Formal education provides children with the skills, both social and intellectual, with which they may approach and conquer life\u2019s challenges. Disabled children confront these same challenges, but begin with the disadvantage of their individual handicaps. Recognizing the significant challenges these children face, and the woefully inadequate preparation they traditionally received, Congress passed the Education of Handicapped Children Act of 1975.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-9\">As a state receiving funds under the EHA, Mississippi must assure that \u201call handicapped children [have] the right to a free appropriate public education.\u201d 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1412(1). This mandate extends to all handicapped children within the state between the ages of five and eighteen.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In order to ensure that each child receives appropriate educational services, the statute elaborates a host of procedural safeguards, including a step by step process of appeals for parents dissatisfied with the educational services the state is providing.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b727-10\">James originally sought relief claiming violations of his section 1983 rights, but later amended his pleadings to include a claim under the EHA. The trial court refused to consider James\u2019 section 1983 claim on the merits, believing that the EHA provided the exclusive remedy. In August 1986, several months after the trial court\u2019s decision, Congress amended the EHA, decreeing that parallel claims arising under the Constitution or other federal statutes could accompany an action under the EHA.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Applying retroactively to actions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"628\">*628</page-number>brought after July 3,1984, Congress added the following subsection:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b728-4\">Nothing in this title shall be construed to restrict or limit the rights, procedures, and remedies available under the Constitution, title V of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, or other Federal statutes protecting the rights of handicapped children and youth, except that before the filing of a civil action under such laws seeking relief that is also available under this part, the procedures under subsections (b)(2) and (c) shall be exhausted to the same extent as would be required had the action been brought under this part.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ape\">Handicapped Children\u2019s Protection Act of 1986, Pub.L. No. 99-372, \u00a7 3, 100 Stat. 796, 797 (to be codified at 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1415(f)).</p>\n<p id=\"b728-5\">When this suit was filed in September 1984, the procedures under subsections (b)(2) and (c) were not available to James. In response to her September 12 complaint to the State Department of Education, Mrs. Thompson was told the reason James could not return to school was the unresolved Youth Court matter. School officials did not notify Mrs. Thompson of, nor offer her the possibility of, an IEP conference at this time. Although we believe the EHA provides the clearest guidance as to the defendants\u2019 duty in this case, section 1983 was properly invoked by James in September 1984.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-6\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b728-7\">As described above, there is significant confusion in the record regarding what transpired when James returned from the State Hospital in April 1984. Mrs. Thompson testified that she told Ms. Miller, James\u2019 social worker, that James should return to school. According to Dr. Schex-nayder, when Ms. Miller first contacted her they had a discussion regarding the wisdom of James\u2019 return at that time. In particular, Dr. Schexnayder expressed concern for James\u2019 safety, the safety of other students, and the little time left in the semester. Dr. Schexnayder testified that she also told Ms. Miller that she thought James\u2019 IEP should be changed. In another conversation, Ms. Miller purportedly told Dr. Schexnayder that she agreed, presumably after having discussed the matter with Mrs. Thompson, that James should not return to school since only a few weeks remained in the term. Mrs. Thompson denied ever agreeing to this arrangement.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-12\">We need not determine whom to believe in this debate,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> since we hold that the school\u2019s failure to convene a conference at this time was a <em>per se </em>violation of the EHA. Dr. Schexnayder testified that Mrs. Thompson was never directly contacted and was never notified, in April 1984, despite the fact that she believed a change in educational placement was warranted, and over a month of school still remained in the spring term. Yet the Act specifically requires that <em>\u201cwritten prior notice </em>to the parents or guardian\u201d be provided whenever a school \u201cproposes to initiate or change ... the identification, evaluation, or education<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"629\">*629</page-number>al placement of the child or the provision of a free appropriate public education to the child.\u201d 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1415(b)(1)(C) (emphasis added). We agree with the Fourth Circuit in finding that failures to meet the Act\u2019s procedural requirements are \u201cadequate grounds by themselves\u201d for holding that the school failed to provide a free appropriate public education, as mandated by the Act. <em>Hall v. Vance County Board of Education, 774 </em>F.2d 629, 635 (4th Cir.1985) (citing <em>Board of Education v. Rowley, </em>458 U.S. 176, 102 S.Ct. 3034, 73 L.Ed.2d 690 (1982)).</p>\n<p id=\"b729-5\">The magistrate came to the conclusion that \u201cMs. Thompson, not the defendants, is the cause of James\u2019 absence from ... the educational process.\u201d In fact, there is some indication in the record that written prior notice was sent to Mrs. Thompson in January.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> But in April, after being informed by Ms. Miller that James was back and wished to return to school, Dr. Schexnayder made no attempt to contact Mrs. Thompson regarding James\u2019 educational placement. Surely parents should, and are expected to, vigilantly oversee their handicapped child\u2019s educational progress. However, under the Act the burden rests squarely on the school or agency to safeguard handicapped children\u2019s rights by informing their parents of those rights. As this court observed in a related context, \u201cin most cases, the handicapped students and their parents lack the wherewithal either to know or to assert their rights under the EHA and section 504.\u201d <em>S-1 v. Turlington, </em>635 F.2d 342, 349 (5th Cir.1981). If Mrs. Thompson received no notification, she could hardly be faulted for not protecting rights she did not know existed.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b730-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"630\">*630</page-number>Even if James\u2019 mother \u201cvoluntarily agreed,\u201d through Ms. Miller, to his withdrawal from school in the spring of 1984, a conference should nevertheless have been convened. The formality of the Act\u2019s procedures is itself a safeguard against arbitrary or erroneous decision-making. Moreover, it must be remembered that the right to an education is not simply the parent's right to give up.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Although under most circumstances parents should be granted wide latitude in determining their child's <em>appropriate </em>educational placement, <em>see, e.g., Pierce v. Society of Sisters, </em>268 U.S. 510, 45 S.Ct. <em>571, </em>69 L.Ed. 1070 (1925), this deference does not extend to changes in placement that amount to no placement at all. <em>See, e.g., Wisconsin v. Yoder, </em>406 U.S. 205, 245, 92 S.Ct. 1526, 1548, 32 L.Ed.2d 15 (1972) (Douglas, J., dissenting) (\u201cIt is the future of the student, not the future of the parent, that is imperiled....\u201d). The framers of the EHA intended that handicapped children should participate, whenever appropriate,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> in the development of their educational programs to help ensure that their rights are properly protected. A formal convening of an IEP conference, with Mrs. Thompson in attendance, and James\u2019 participation encouraged, would have provided a forum for a thorough examination of the appropriate course to follow. In contrast, the informal procedures adhered to in the spring of 1984, demonstrate exactly those problems that the framers of the EHA tried to avoid with the procedural steps required by section 1415.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-11\">Whatever dispute exists surrounding the events of the spring of 1984, there is no question that Mrs. Thompson, both individually and through James\u2019 social worker, Ms. Miller, actively sought readmission of James the following fall. In the brief to this court, defendants\u2019 counsel suggests that Mrs. Thompson took no action until she filed the complaint on September 12 with the State Department of Education. Counsel conveniently overlooks the many conversations between Dr. Schexnayder and Ms. Miller beginning the first day of school in August, even though the defendants relied on similar conversations when defending the \u201cdecision\u201d not to provide services the previous semester.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b731-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"631\">*631</page-number>Apparently, the magistrate viewed the continuing jurisdiction of the Youth Court as sufficient reason for denying James readmission in the fall. But clearly there was no reason for him to so believe, especially since the IEP conference ultimately was convened without any resolution of the Youth Court matter. Not until October 19, nearly a month after this suit was filed, did the defendants provide notice of an IEP conference. Thus, for two months in the fall the defendants unilaterally deprived James of his right to an education without ever giving written notice of cause, or providing a hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-5\">In a case arising outside the special context of handicapped children, the Court in <em>Goss v. Lopez, </em>419 U.S. 565, 581, 95 S.Ct. 729, 740, 42 L.Ed.2d 725 (1975), held that even a short suspension of up to ten days requires notice of the charges, and some type of informal hearing. Suspensions exceeding ten days require more formal procedures. <em>Id. </em>at 585, 95 S.Ct. at 741. \u201cThe fundamental requisite of due process of law is the opportunity to be heard,\u201d <em>Grannis v. Ordean, </em>234 U.S. 385, 394, 34 S.Ct. 779, 783, 58 L.Ed. 1363 (1914), a right that \u201chas little reality or worth unless one is informed that the matter is pending and can choose for himself whether to ... contest.\u201d Mul<em>lane v. Central Hanover Bank &amp; Trust Co., </em>339 U.S. 306, 314, 70 S.Ct. 652, 657, 94 L.Ed. 865 (1950). We conclude, therefore, that under either the EHA or the Fourteenth Amendment, school officials were required to provide James with notice and a hearing regarding his continued exclusion from school. Indeed, the fact that James was a handicapped student only worsens the consequences of the due process violation that occurred in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-6\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b731-7\">We hold, as a matter of law, that James\u2019 due process rights, as contemplated by the Fourteenth Amendment and as specifically enumerated by the EHA, were violated by Franklin County School officials\u2019 failure to provide notice and a hearing concerning his continued exclusion from school. It does not follow that plaintiffs are entitled to substantial damages, however. Mrs. Thompson seemed especially obstinate and self-serving regarding what might be done to educate James, and thus is substantially at fault for James\u2019 loss after October 1984. We cannot discern from the record whether Mrs. Thompson would have been equally\" obstinate if provided the same options in April. Nor do we know whether school officials would have offered a plan of placement more accepts able to Mrs. Thompson if a conference had been held in April. It appears from the record that both parties\u2019 positions stiffened by the time they met in October.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-9\">We therefore remand this case so the district court can seek the answer to two questions. First, what is the extent of James\u2019 loss <em>caused by the defendants\u2019failure </em>to provide notice and a hearing in April, and again in August, 1984. The district court should determine whether Mrs. Thompson, if provided notice and a hearing in April and/or August, nevertheless would have rejected the educational placements offered. Even though the school\u2019s proposals in October were adequate, the court may consider whether other options might have been offered in April, prior to the stiffening of positions due to the increased adversarial nature of the relationship between the parties. In short, while perhaps impossible to do with any precision, we ask the district court to bring the parties back to April 1984, to discover what would have happened if the school had held the conference.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-10\">Secondly, the district court must determine what damages, either monetary, or in the form of remedial educational services for James, would be appropriate at this time. If it becomes apparent that Mrs. Thompson would have followed the same obstinate course in April that she took in October, only nominal damages would be appropriate. However, if the district court finds that circumstances would have been different, and James was injured by the defendants\u2019 actions or omissions, damages should be assessed. We add, finally, that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"632\">*632</page-number>if such is the case, although monetary relief is available, remedial educational services may be more valuable than any pecuniary damages that could be awarded.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-4\">REVERSED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b725-12\">. In fact, at some point Ms. Miller informed Dr. Schexnayder that she had talked to the judge and he told her the Youth Court matter had nothing to do with James\u2019 readmission to school. Dr. Schexnayder recalled this conversation, testifying as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b725-13\">I remember at the time that I asked Mrs. Miller if she had statement, (sic) a written statement to that effect for the School Board, other than a conversation that take (sic) place in a hall.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"art-dedup-1\">Ms. Miller did not have such a statement, and Dr. Schexnayder never considered calling the judge to ask him about it.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b726-6\">. Dr. Schexnayder provided the State Department of Education with the following explanation for her actions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b726-7\">James Jackson is under a temporary restraining order issued by juvenile court. He was to appear before the judge upon his release from East Mississippi and has not done so. The youth prosecuting attorney has petitioned the court to order James not to return to school. The school district is awaiting the outcome of these proceedings.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b726-8\">. The original complaint relied exclusively on \u00a7 1983 for relief. It was later amended to state a cause of action under the EHA. In the original complaint, and to some extent before this court, the plaintiffs claim that the January suspension was racially motivated. We agree with the magistrate that \"there is not one shred of evidence that James was placed on a three-day suspension for a racially motivated reason.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b726-9\">. After the due process hearing, James appealed the impartial hearing officer's decision to a United States District Court, as provided by the EHA. 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1415(e)(2). The present appeal follows a trial on the merits of this action. While this case was pending in the district court, James filed a motion for preliminary injunction seeking to be returned to his then current placement, the Franklin County public schools. The district court denied this motion, <em>Jackson v. Franklin County School Board, </em>606 F.Supp. 152 (S.D.Miss.1985), and on appeal we affirmed this judgment. We held that \"the public schools unquestionably retain their authority to remove any student, handicapped or otherwise, who disrupts the educational process or poses a threat to a safe school environment.\" <em>Jackson v. Franklin County School Board, </em>765 F.2d 535, 538 (5th Cir.1985).</p>\n<p id=\"aam-dedup-0\">In our previous opinion on this matter we expressly refused to consider James\u2019 contentions that he, acting through Ms. Miller, requested, but was denied, readmission to school following release from the hospital. 765 F.2d at 536 n. 1. The district court found that James did not seek readmission until the fall semester of 1984. In this opinion we consider whether this finding was clearly erroneous in light of the record and applicable law.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b727-11\">. In many cases this mandate broadens to include all handicapped children between the ages of three and twenty-one. The Act provides that, \"with respect to handicapped children aged three to five and aged eighteen to twenty-one, inclusive, the requirements of this clause shall not be applied in any State if the application of such requirements would be inconsistent with State law or practice, or the order of any court, respecting public education within such age groups in the State.\u201d 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1412(2)(B). Since James was sixteen when the actions that led to this case arose, he falls fully within the scope of the statute.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b727-12\">. As discussed more fully below, the EHA\u2019s procedural safeguards require parents or guardians of handicapped children to be notified of any proposed change in \"the identification, evaluation, or educational placement of the child or the provision of a free appropriate public education to the child,\u201d and must be permitted to bring a complaint about \"any matter relating to\u201d such evaluation and education. \u00a7\u00a7 1415(b)(1)(C) and (E). Complaints brought by parents or guardians must be resolved at \"an impartial due process hearing,\" and appeal to the state educational agency must be provided if the initial hearing is held at the local or regional level. \u00a7\u00a7 1415(b)(2) and (c). Thereafter, \"[a]ny party aggrieved by the findings and decision\u201d of the state administrative hearing has \"the right to bring a civil action with respect to the complaint ... in any State court of competent jurisdiction or in a district court of the United States without regard to the amount in controversy.\u201d \u00a7 1415(e)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b727-15\">. The trial court\u2019s position apparently was based on <em>Smith v. Robinson, </em>468 U.S. 992, 1012, 104 S.Ct. 3457, 3470, 82 L.Ed.2d 746 (1984), where the Court concluded, \"that where the EHA is available to a handicapped child asserting a right to a free appropriate public education, based either on the EHA or on the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, the EHA is the exclusive avenue through which the child and his parents or guardian can pursue their claim.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b727-16\">However, even had Congress not amended the EHA, we believe James\u2019 \u00a7 1983 claim was prop<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"628\">*628</page-number>er. The Court\u2019s holding in <em>Smith </em>was limited to equal protection claims, whereas James sought relief for a deprivation of his due process rights. As the <em>Smith </em>Court recognized, the same analysis cannot be applied similarly to both. Addressing the possibility of recovering attorney\u2019s fees under a \u00a7 1983 due process claim, before the EHA was amended to provide such relief, the Court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b728-9\">[U]nlike an independent equal protection claim, maintenance of an independent due process challenge to state procedures would not be inconsistent with the EHA\u2019s comprehensive scheme____ [W]hile Congress apparently has determined that local and state agencies should not be burdened with attorney's fees to litigants who succeed, through resort to the procedures outlined in the EHA, in requiring those agencies to provide free schooling, there is no indication that agencies should be exempt from a fee award where plaintiffs have had to resort to judicial relief to force the agencies to provide them the process they were constitutionally due.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"aq9-dedup-0\">468 U.S. at 1014, 104 S.Ct. at 3471 n. 17.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b728-15\">. The trial court accepted Dr. Schexnayder\u2019s account, finding that Ms. Miller \"conveyed [the agreement] to Ms. Thompson, Jackson\u2019s mother, who agreed with the decision.\" It is unclear how the trial court could make such a finding since Ms. Miller never testified. However, we do not have to consider whether this finding was clearly erroneous, as we explain in the text.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b729-6\">. The magistrate made no specific finding on the question whether the school provided \"written prior notice\u201d as required by the Act. As recounted in the text, Dr. Schexnayder testified that she never contacted Mrs. Thompson in April 1984, when James returned from the State Hospital. However, there is some indication in the record that notice of a need for an IEP conference was sent in January, at the time Mrs. Thompson received notification of the three-day suspension. But this testimony is partially contradicted elsewhere in the record, and the January letter informing Mrs. Thompson of an IEP conference was never proffered as evidence; also, other documents cast significant doubt over its actual existence.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-7\">In questioning by plaintiff\u2019s counsel, Dr. Schexnayder testified as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b729-8\">Q. You didn\u2019t really send her any notice [in April] that you were considering placing James in a different educational program, did you, placement program, did you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b729-9\">A. I did not send any notice at that time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b729-10\">Q. As a matter of fact, you really did not send Mrs. Thompson any kind of notice whatsoever relating to this matter except for you may have sent notice on the three day suspension?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b729-11\">A. In January she received the notice of the three day suspension.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b729-12\">At this point, then, the witness did not mention written prior notice sent in January. Later, on direct examination by defendants\u2019 counsel, she testified as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b729-13\">Q. Did y\u2019all cause a notice to be sent to the Plaintiffs mother, Mrs. Lillie Thompson?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b729-14\">A. Ves. The notice would have been mailed to the mother stipulating the reason for the suspension, the length of the suspension and giving her the right to come in for a conference and informing her that an IEP would have to be reviewed or revised before he returned to school.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"amz-dedup-1\">Yet no copy of such a letter was introduced into evidence. More importantly, Defendants\u2019 Exhibit 9, a document entitled \u201cFranklin County Schools Documentation of Parent Contacts,\u201d does not mention any such notice. This document, however, lists over six other occasions when \u201cwritten prior notice\" was sent to Mrs. Thompson regarding IEP revision.</p>\n<p id=\"AN2Y\">Without the guidance of the district court we certainly are not prepared to draw any conclusions regarding this factual question. Because we hold that failure to provide a hearing in April, and then again in August, violated the procedural safeguards of the Act, the issue of a notice to Mrs. Thompson in January has no effect on our decision.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b729-19\">. In <em>Rowley, </em>the Court stated that \"Congress sought to protect individual children by providing for parental involvement in the development of state plans and policies.\" 458 U.S. at 208, 102 S.Ct. at 3052. The Court quoted from the Senate Report, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b729-20\">The Committee recognizes that in many instances the process of providing special education and related services to handicapped children is not guaranteed to produce any particular outcome. By changing the language [of the provision relating to individualized educational programs] to emphasize the process of parent and child involvement and to provide a written record of reasonable expectations, the Committee intends to clarify that such individualized planning conferences <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"630\">*630</page-number>are a way to provide parent involvement and protection to assure that appropriate services are provided to a handicapped child.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b730-6\"><em>Id. </em>(quoting S.Rep. No. 94-168, 94th Cong., 1st Sess. 11-12 (1975), <em>reprinted in </em>1975 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News 1425, 1435-36).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b730-7\">. James' right to an education stems from several different sources. Foremost, the EHA guarantees an appropriate education to all children between the ages of five and eighteen. 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1412(2)(B), <em>see supra </em>note 5. In addition, the Mississippi Constitution states that \"[t]he Legislature may, in its discretion, provide for the maintenance and establishment of free public schools for all children between the ages of six (6) and twenty-one (21) years.\u201d Miss. Const, art. VIII, \u00a7 201. Effectuating this mandate, the Mississippi Legislature enacted a law for the maintenance of \"a uniform system of free public schools consisting of grades one through twelve.\u201d Miss.Code Ann. \u00a7 37-13-1 (1972).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b730-8\">. Section 1401(19), which sets forth the manner in which a proper IEP is developed, states as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b730-9\">The term [IEP] means a written statement for each handicapped child <em>developed in any meeting </em>by a representative of the local educational agency, ... the teacher, the parents or guardian of such child, <em>and, whenever appropriate, such </em>child____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AdN\">20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1401(19) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"aqx-dedup-0\">The importance of the IEP conference cannot be denied. During the congressional debates Senator Williams explained as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aa9\">I think that one of the greatest benefits that can come to the handicapped child is to have the parents brought into this conference, because the education of the child continues after the school doors close and that child is at home. This is part of the educational process. That is one of the reasons why we have developed the idea of the mandatory conference, to make sure that the parent is part of the education of the child.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"afv-dedup-0\">121 Cong.Rec. 19501 (1975).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b730-17\">. When defending their actions in the spring of 1984, defendants rely on Ms. Miller\u2019s acquiescence to the decision not to provide services. When discussing the fall semester, however, the defendants expediently forget Ms. Miller\u2019s role in attempting to have James readmitted in August. The defendants cannot have it both ways, despite their protestations to the contrary. Moreover, even if we adopt September 12 as the date Mrs. Thompson first attempted to reenroll James, or even September 24, the date she filed suit in federal court, the defendants still waited a month to provide notice of an IEP conference.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
