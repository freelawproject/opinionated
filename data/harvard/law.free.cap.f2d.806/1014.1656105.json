In <em>In re Millard Kennedy and Glenwodyne B. Kennedy, </em>785 F.2d 1553 (11th Cir.1986), we held as initial matters that the Kennedys did not waive their right to notice under O.C.G.A. \u00a7 11-9-504(3) and that the notice requirements of O.C.G.A. \u00a7 11-9-504(3) are not preempted by federal law. After finding that the remaining issue in the case presented an important question of Georgia law on which there was no clear, controlling precedent, we certified the following question to the Supreme Court of Georgia:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1099-15\">Whether the bar against collection of any deficiency if a sale of collateral occurs without notice, in violation of O.C.G.A. \u00a7 11-9-504(3), prevents a creditor holding a claim secured by both personal property and real property from proceeding against the real estate to collect the balance remaining after a commercially unreasonable sale of the personalty.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1099-16\">In <em>United States v. Kennedy, </em>256 Ga. 345, 348 S.E.2d 636 (1986), the Georgia Supreme Court answered this question in the affirmative. It concluded that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A1V8\">where a sale of collateral occurs without notice, in violation of O.C.G.A. \u00a7 11-9-504(3), the bar against collection of a deficiency [upon the debt secured by such collateral] prevents a creditor from holding a claim against a guarantor secured by real property from proceeding against the real estate to collect the balance remaining after a commercially unreasonable sale of the personalty.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1099-17\"><em>Id. </em>at 347-48, 348 S.E.2d 636. We are grateful to the Supreme Court of Georgia for its cooperation and assistance.</p>\n<p id=\"b1099-18\">Because the law of Georgia on this point is now clear, we affirm the district court\u2019s decision upholding the bankruptcy court\u2019s ruling that FmHA\u2019s failure to give notice bars it from recovering any deficiency against the Kennedys based upon their second security deed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1099-19\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
