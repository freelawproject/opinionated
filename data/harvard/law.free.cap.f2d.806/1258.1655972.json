We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1343-19\">Jack R. Gamble, Jr., filed suit under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 alleging that the Louisiana Downs racing stewards violated his procedural due process rights when they suspended his race horse owner\u2019s license on May 10, 1983. The defendants are the ten members of the Louisiana State Racing Commission (\u201cCommission\u201d) and the three racing stewards appointed by the Commission. The district court decided this case on cross-motions for summary judgment.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The sole issue presented in this appeal is what process is due when racing stewards temporarily suspend the privileges granted to a licensee by Louisiana law.</p>\n<p id=\"b1343-20\">The plaintiff owns and races thoroughbred horses in Louisiana. Louisiana issued him an owner\u2019s license for the 1981-82 racing season, and the 1982-83 season. On his 1981-82 license application, he answered question No. 22, a question about prior arrests,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> \u201cNo.\u201d On the following year\u2019s application Gamble answered the same question \u201cYes.\u201d When his trainer turned in the 1982-83 application, however, the Commission\u2019s office manager and the trainer marked the \u201cYes\u201d answer as error and checked the \u201cNo\u201d blank because a \u201cYes\u201d answer required an explanation and none was provided. On March 28, 1983, the racing stewards received a list from the Louisiana State Police of those people whose owner\u2019s applications contained discrepancies with police records. The list of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1260\">*1260</page-number>53 people included the plaintiff.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The Commission\u2019s chief investigator then attempted to contact those people and inform them of the discrepancy. The plaintiff was contacted, but it appears the exact nature of the problem was not discussed. On April 29 or 30, the plaintiff went to the Commission office and was specifically informed that he had a problem with Question No. 22 on his application. On May 3, the plaintiff, an attorney, sent a letter to the stewards and the Committee objecting to Question No. 22 and including a modified version of the question to which he answered \u201cNo.\u201d <footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AA0\">On May 5, the stewards suspended plaintiff\u2019s license, effective May 10, \u201cpending appearance before the Stewards for investigation of falsification of license application.\u201d <footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Mem.Op. at 6. The stewards based the suspension on the fact that the plaintiff had falsified question No. 22 and would not change his \u201cNo\u201d answer. The stewards did not notify the plaintiff before they issued the order. The plaintiff found out about the stewards\u2019 ruling on May 15 and wrote a letter to the stewards that requested an immediate hearing on the suspension. The stewards scheduled a hearing on May 18, but because their office was at the race track and the plaintiff\u2019s suspension prohibited him to enter any race track, Gamble declined to attend. The stewards made it clear to Gamble\u2019s lawyer that they would give Gamble \u201cexpress\u201d authorization to come on to the racing grounds and delay the hearing until Gamble could get there.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> After this fiasco, the stewards reset the hearing for May 21 and sent the plaintiff a letter that expressly authorized him to enter the racing grounds. The plaintiff had already appealed to the Commission and it had placed his appeal on the agenda for its May 27 meeting. Gamble decided to skip the stewards\u2019 May 21 meeting because of his scheduled meeting with the Commission. At the May 27 meeting, however, the Commission did not decide on the merits because the plaintiff had failed to appear before the stewards. The stewards next scheduled a meeting for June 8. Gamble informed the stewards that he could not attend then because he was scheduled to introduce the speaker at a local Rotary Club meeting.</p>\n<p id=\"b1344-10\">At that point, Gamble turned to the state courts and received satisfaction in the form of injunctions against the Commission and the stewards. No other hearings were scheduled by the stewards or Gamble. Gamble received a new license when he completed an application answering \u201cYes\u201d to the inquiry about past arrests.</p>\n<p id=\"b1344-11\">The plaintiff\u2019s suit successfully states a cause of action under \u00a7 1983: deprivation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1261\">*1261</page-number>of a constitutional right caused by persons acting under color of state law. <em>Fontana v. Barham, </em>707 F.2d 221, 225 (5th Cir.1983). The defendants concede that Gamble\u2019s license constitutes a property interest protected by the Fourteenth Amendment. <em>See Board of Regents v. Roth, </em>408 U.S. 564, 577, 92 S.Ct. 2701, 2709, 33 L.Ed.2d 548, 561 (1972). They also concede that the plaintiff has met the \u201ccolor of state law\u201d requirement. <em>Sims v. Jefferson Downs Racing Association, Inc., </em>778 F.2d 1068, 1076 (5th Cir.1985). The plaintiff therefore complains that the stewards did not accord him the procedural due process required by the Fourteenth Amendment when they suspended his owner\u2019s license.</p>\n<p id=\"b1345-6\">Procedural due process consists of notice and the opportunity to be heard. <em>Cleveland Board of Education v. Loudermill, </em>470 U.S. 532, 542, 105 S.Ct. 1487, 1493, 84 L.Ed.2d 494, 503-04 (1985). Although some form of hearing is required before the owner is finally deprived of a protected property interest, the \u201ctiming and nature of the required hearing \u2018will depend on appropriate accommodation of the competing interests involved.\u2019 \u201d <em>Logan v. Zimmerman Brush Co., </em>455 U.S. 422, 434, 102 S.Ct. 1148, 1157, 71 L.Ed.2d 265, 277 (1982) <em>(quoting Goss v. Lopez, </em>419 U.S. 565, 579, 95 S.Ct. 729, 738, 42 L.Ed.2d 725 (1975)) (footnote omitted). These competing interests \u201cinclude the importance of the private interest and the length or finality of the deprivation; the likelihood of governmental error; and the magnitude of the governmental interests involved.\u201d <em>Logan, </em>455 U.S. at 434, 102 S.Ct. at 1157, 71 L.Ed.2d at 277 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1345-8\">Gamble does not contend that the <em>post </em>-deprivation procedures were inadequate. Instead, he urges that due process in this instance requires some sort of hearing before any temporary suspension of an owner\u2019s license. The Supreme Court has noted that \u201c[t]here are, of course, some situations in which a post-deprivation hearing will satisfy due process requirements.\u201d <em>Loudermill, </em>470 U.S. at 542 n. 7, 105 S.Ct. at 1493 n. 7, 84 L.Ed.2d at 504 n. 7 (citations omitted). We hold that the present one is such a situation. To reach this decision, we have balanced the competing interests outlined in <em>Logan, </em>aided by the Supreme Court\u2019s holding in <em>Barry v. Barchi, </em>443 U.S. 55, 99 S.Ct. 2642, 61 L.Ed.2d 365 (1979). There, the Court addressed the summary suspension of a New York horse trainer\u2019s license and ruled:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1345-11\">We do not agree with Barchi\u2019s basic contention, however, that an evidentiary hearing was required prior to the effec-tuation of his suspension. Unquestionably, the magnitude of a trainer\u2019s interest in avoiding suspension is substantial; but the State also has an important interest in assuring the integrity of the racing carried on under its auspices. In these circumstances, it seems to us that the State is entitled to impose an interim suspension, pending a prompt judicial or administrative hearing that would definitely determine the issues____ In such circumstances, the State\u2019s interest in preserving the integrity of the sport and in protecting the public from harm becomes most acute. At the same time, there is substantial assurance that the trainer\u2019s interest is not being baselessly compromised.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1345-13\"><em>Id. </em>at 64-65, 99 S.Ct. at 2649, 61 L.Ed.2d at 375 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1345-14\">In the present case, Gamble\u2019s interest in his horse owner\u2019s license is substantial. Yet, the suspension was temporary, effective only pending a hearing that was available in this case eight days after the date of the suspension, and within three days of Gamble\u2019s request. The likelihood of governmental error in this case is also small. The information determining that Gamble\u2019s application contained a discrepancy came from the Louisiana State Police records; in other words, a reliable source with reliable records. Finally, the State\u2019s interest in maintaining the integrity of horse racing in Louisiana is great. We hold that the reasoning in the above quoted passage from <em>Barry </em>applies here. The State must have effective means of dealing with those who have lied on their applications. In addition, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1262\">*1262</page-number>parallel to the facts of <em>Barry, </em>the suspension in this case did not come out of thin air. The Commission notified Gamble of the discrepancy in his application. The stewards gave him an \u201copportunity to present his side of the story\u201d before the suspension. <em>See Barry, </em>443 U.S. at 65, 99 S.Ct. at 2649, 61 L.Ed.2d at 376.</p>\n<p id=\"b1346-4\">We agree with the district court\u2019s conclusion that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1346-5\">when the owner\u2019s interest is balanced against the need to maintain the integrity of horse racing, the swiftness of the administrative determination, the indicia of reliability, and the informal notice which plaintiff received, ... a pre-hear-ing suspension pending appearance before the stewards does not violate the Fourteenth Amendment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1346-6\">Mem.Op. at 16.</p>\n<p id=\"b1346-7\">The plaintiff does not challenge the adequacy of the post-deprivation hearing available to him nor can we find any fault with the stewards\u2019 swift actions during the plaintiff\u2019s suspension. We therefore AFFIRM the district court\u2019s order granting the defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1343-16\">. Although both parties agreed to dispose of this case in this way, they neglected to submit stipulated facts. The district court, however, found that \"[fjrom the record, evidence and findings of fact submitted by both parties, it appears that there is no dispute as to any <em>material </em>fact.\u201d Mem.Op. at 2 (emphasis in original). The court then made findings of fact and required the parties to file with the court any disagreements they had with those findings. Neither party disagreed then, nor do they complain now, of the court\u2019s findings of fact.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"ane-dedup-2\">. Question No. 22 on the Application for License reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AJpO\">Have you been convicted of violating any municipal or parish ordinances, or have you ever been ARRESTED, indicted, pleaded guilty, pleaded nolo contendere, been found guilty, or been convicted, or forteited [sic] bail or been fined for any criminal offense, either felony or misdemeanor (except traffic violations other than driving under the influence of intoxicating liquor)?

Under Louisiana statute, only the Commission may revoke a license, but the stewards may recommend revocation and may suspend a license for the duration of a racing meet plus ten days.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b1344-7\">. The district court's findings of facts to this incident are as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1344-8\">Plaintiff had requested that he receive written authorization to enter Louisiana Downs for that hearing. Gamble did receive a letter setting the time for the hearing; however, the letter contained no language which explicitly stated that \u201cJack R. Gamble, Jr. is authorized to enter Louisiana Downs.\u201d Plaintiffs attorney received this letter on the morning of the hearing and telephoned the LSRC office to request that written notice be left at Gate No. 1 at the race track. The stewards felt that the letter, itself, was authorization to enter the grounds, but they attempted to comply with the plaintiffs request. An authorization was drafted, and an attempt was made to leave it at the gate; however, no guard was present because it was morning and not time yet for the day's racing to begin. When Gamble and his attorney arrived at the gate and found no authorization, Gamble left the premises on the grounds that he did not wish to violate the provisions of Ruling 157. His attorney went on to the hearing, and plaintiff awaited his attorney at a nearby hotel. The stewards offered to wait until Gamble could return; however, plaintiffs counsel stated that his position was that plaintiff was not there because no authorization letter was received. He stated, \u201cI prefer to leave it at that junction.\"</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ah1\">Mem. Op. at 7-8.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
