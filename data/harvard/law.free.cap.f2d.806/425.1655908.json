At nos. 85-5818 and 85-5819, Edward Engler appeals from sentences imposed on convictions, contending that the government entrapped him as a matter of law, that he was denied due process as guaranteed by the Fifth Amendment because of \u201coutrageous\u201d conduct of government agents, and that the court erred in an evidentiary ruling at trial. At nos. 85-5834 and 85-5835, the government appeals from the district court\u2019s post-trial dismissal of indictments on the basis that the strict liability felony provision of the Migratory Bird Treaty Act, 16 U.S.C. \u00a7 707(b)(2), violates the due process clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-6\">Whatever has been our history as a nation of hunters and trappers, it is clear that Congress has declared that modern out-doorsmen and outdoorswomen may not interfere with migrating birds, and that the taking and sale of these birds is illegal. Edward Engler was prosecuted for violating the Migratory Bird Treaty Act on the basis of the following circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-7\">In September 1982, David Kirkland, an undercover agent for the United States Fish and Wildlife Service, met with Edward Engler and Elwood Laudenslager at a \u201ctrapper\u2019s rendezvous\u201d near North Bend, Pennsylvania. Kirkland represented that he was a dealer in animal parts (e.g. bear claws, raccoon tails) and discussed the possibility of purchasing animal parts from Engler and Laudenslager. Over the next several months, Kirkland and other Fish and Wildlife agents purchased animal and bird parts as well as whole birds from Engler and Laudenslager. Between May 15, 1983 and January 16, 1985, Engler sold the agents birds or bird parts that were protected under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act. Engler and Laudenslager also sold dynamite to the agents.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-10\">A grand jury returned three indictments against Engler. The first two charged him with one count of selling or aiding and abetting the sale of stolen explosives in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2, 842(b), and with fifteen counts of selling migratory birds or bird parts in violation of the Migratory Bird Treaty Act, 16 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 703, 707(b)(2). The third charged Engler with one explosives count and one migratory bird count. After a jury trial, Engler was found guilty on all counts. In response to post-trial motions, the district court dismissed the counts brought pursuant to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>Migratory Bird Treaty Act but denied En-gler\u2019s motions for judgment of acquittal and new trial on the remaining counts. We shall first address Engler\u2019s contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-5\">The first basis of Engler\u2019s appeal from the district court\u2019s denial of motions for judgment of acquittal or for new trial is his contention that he had established his entrapment as a matter of law because the government failed to introduce evidence sufficient to prove his predisposition to commit the offenses charged. <em>See United States v. Williams, </em>705 F.2d 603, 613 (2d Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>464 U.S. 1007, 104 S.Ct. 524, 78 L.Ed.2d 708 (1983). On review of the district court\u2019s denial of a motion for judgment of acquittal on this issue, the appellate court must apply the same standard that the district court should have used initially:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b528-6\">In ruling on a motion to overturn a jury\u2019s finding of predisposition the trial court must view the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, and resolve all reasonable inferences therefrom in its favor____ Viewing the evidence in this light, the trial court must uphold the jury\u2019s verdict unless no reasonable jury could conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant was predisposed to commit the offense for which he was convicted.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b528-9\"><em>United States v. Jannotti, </em>673 F.2d 578, 598 (3d Cir.)(in banc), <em>cert. denied, </em>457 U.S. 1106, 102 S.Ct. 2906, 73 L.Ed.2d 1315 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b528-10\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-11\">To be entitled to an entrapment charge in this circuit, \u201ca defendant must first present evidence both that the government initiated the crime ... and that the defendant was otherwise not predisposed to commit the crime.\u201d <em>United States v. Gambino, </em>788 F.2d 938, 943 (3d Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 107 S.Ct. 98, 93 L.Ed.2d 49 (1986). Once the defendant has profferred such evidence, the burden shifts to the government to disprove the elements of the entrapment defense beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>Jannotti, </em>673 F.2d at 597. Entrapment is established as a matter of law only \u201c[w]here the evidence is undisputed that the defendant had no predisposition to commit the crimes with which he is charged, and was induced to do so only by the trickery, persuasion or fraud of the government....\u201d <em>Gambino, </em>788 F.2d at 944.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-17\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-18\">We are satisfied that the government introduced sufficient evidence to allow a jury reasonably to conclude that Engler was predisposed to take protected birds for commercial purposes in violation of the MBTA and to engage in illegal sales of explosives. Special Agent David Kirkland testified, for example, that it was Engler \u2014 not the government agents \u2014 who initiated discussions concerning the sale of hawk claws to Kirkland. App. at 226. Notwithstanding Kirkland\u2019s admonition that such sales were illegal, <em>id., </em>Engler subsequently telephoned Kirkland and offered to sell hawk claws. <em>Id. </em>at 64-65; <em>see also id. </em>at 226-33.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-19\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-20\">The government also introduced evidence that Engler initiated discussions with Kirkland concerning the sale of dynamite. <em>See, e.g., </em>app. at 112-15, 294. Engler does not seriously dispute this. He seems to concede that the government introduced sufficient evidence to establish his predisposition regarding the first sale of dynamite, <em>see </em>br. for appellant at 16, yet he fashions a novel argument. He contends that the fact of his predisposition at the time of the first dynamite sale does not establish his predisposition at the time of the second dynamite sale. We must reject this argument. \u201c \u2018[A]n existing course of criminal conduct similar to the crime for which the defendant is charged\u2019 \u201d may be introduced to meet the government\u2019s burden of proof on predisposition. <em>Gambino, </em>788 F.2d at 945. Evidence of Engler\u2019s initial offer and sale of dynamite is thus <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>sufficient to demonstrate Engler\u2019s predisposition to make the second sale. Moreover, a \u201cdefendant\u2019s predisposition is not to be assessed \u2018as of that time when he committed the crime,\u2019 \u201d because predisposition \u201crefers to the state of mind of a defendant before government agents make any suggestion that he should commit a crime.\u201d <em>Williams, </em>705 F.2d at 618. Engler concedes that the government introduced evidence of his predisposition during the critical time, that is, before the alleged inducement. Accordingly, we conclude that En-gler\u2019s suggestion that the government failed to introduce evidence sufficient to establish his predisposition at the time of the second dynamite sale is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-5\">D.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-6\">Finally, Engler\u2019s reliance on <em>United States v. Dion, </em>762 F.2d 674 (8th Cir.1985), <em>rev\u2019d in part, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 106 S.Ct. 2216, 90 L.Ed.2d 767 (1986), is misplaced. There, the government contended that the defendant had been predisposed to violate the MBTA because he had \u201creadily and willingly responded to a mere opportunity to kill an eagle for profit.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 686. The court disagreed, finding that the government \u201chad not merely given [the defendant] an opportunity to take or kill an eagle but [had] encouraged [him] to do so by the agents\u2019 repeated direct and indirect solicitation over a nearly two-year period.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Such circumstances are not present here; on the contrary, the government introduced evidence that Engler actually initiated negotiations for the sale of protected birds.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-9\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-10\">Engler next contends that the district court erred by denying his motions for acquittal because the conduct of the government agents was so \u201coutrageous\u201d as to violate due process. Similarly, he argues that the district court erred by failing to instruct the jury on his due process defense. Our standard of review is plenary-</p>\n<p id=\"b529-12\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-13\">In <em>United States v. Russell, </em>411 U.S. 423, 431-32, 93 S.Ct. 1637, 1642-43, 36 L.Ed.2d 366 (1973), the Court indicated, in dictum, that under some circumstances, \u201cthe conduct of law enforcement agents [could be] so outrageous that due process principles would absolutely bar the government from invoking judicial processes to obtain a conviction....\u201d Subsequently, however, a plurality of the Court indicated that the \u201cdue process defense\u201d is unavailable where, as here, the defendant willingly commits the crime. <em>Hampton v. United States, </em>425 U.S. 484, 490, 96 S.Ct. 1646, 1650, 48 L.Ed.2d 113 (1976) (\u201cThe remedy of the criminal defendant with respect to the acts of Government agents, which, far from being resisted, are encouraged by him, lies solely in the defense of entrapment.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b529-16\">On appeal, Engler merely characterizes the undercover activities of the government as outrageous; he fails to make even the requisite allegations that \u201cthe Government activity in question violate[d] some protected right of the <em>defendant.\u201d Id. </em>To the extent that Engler contends the government\u2019s actions harmed him, his allegations are merely duplicative of his entrapment defense contentions. Such allegations may not provide an independent basis for a defense or acquittal. <em>Id. </em>at 489-91, 96 S.Ct. at 1649-51; <em>see also United States v. Jannotti, </em>673 F.2d at 608 (\u201cWe must be careful not to undermine the [Supreme] Court\u2019s consistent rejection of the objective test of entrapment by permitting it to reemerge cloaked as a due process defense.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b529-17\">The government agents\u2019 conduct here is easily distinguished from those unusual circumstances that have been held to violate due process. <em>See United States v. Twigg, </em>588 F.2d 373, 381 (3d Cir.1978)(DEA agents \u201cdeceptively implanted the criminal design in [defendant\u2019s] mind,\u201d and then \u201cset him up, encouraged him, provided the essential supplies and technical expertise and when he ... encountered difficulties in consummating the crime ... assisted in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>finding solutions.\u201d); <em>Greene v. United States, </em>454 F.2d 783, 786-87 (9th Cir.1971) (government agent involved in illegal activities for over two years supplied materials, operator, and location for illegal still and was sole purchaser of all liquor produced). Engler has not introduced evidence of such government conduct as would \u201cshock[ ] the conscience of the Court,\u201d <em>United States v. Beverly, </em>723 F.2d 11, 13 (3d Cir.1983)(per curiam), or otherwise compel it to overcome its \u201cextreme caution in finding due process violations in undercover settings.\u201d <em>United States v. Gambino, </em>788 F.2d 938, 945 n. 6 (3d Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 107 S.Ct. 98, 93 L.Ed.2d 49 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b530-6\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-7\">Engler\u2019s additional contention that the district court erred by failing to instruct the jury on his due process defense is without merit. The question whether government conduct was so outrageous as to constitute a violation of due process is a question of law to be determined by the court, not the jury. <em>United States v. Salazar, </em>720 F.2d 1482, 1488 (10th Cir.1983), <em>cert. denied, </em>469 U.S. 1110, 105 S.Ct. 789, 83 L.Ed.2d 783 (1985); <em>United States v. Prairie, </em>572 F.2d 1316, 1319 (9th Cir.1978); <em>see also United States v. Russell, </em>411 U.S. at 441, 93 S.Ct. at 1647 (Stewart, J., dissenting) (\u201c[T]he determination of the lawfulness of the Government\u2019s conduct must be made \u2014 as it is on all questions involving the legality of law enforcement methods\u2014 by the trial judge, not the jury.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b530-8\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-9\">Finally, Engler argues that the district court improperly admitted testimony of Special Agent Kirkland that Kirkland believed the fur trapping company for which Engler had worked had been engaged in illegal activity. Engler alternatively contends that this testimony was irrelevant, inadmissible hearsay, or unduly prejudicial. Because the district court\u2019s initial determination of relevancy implicates the interpretation and application of legal precepts, the standard of review is plenary. <em>In re Japanese Electronic Products Antitrust Litigation, </em>723 F.2d 238, 269 (3d Cir.1983), <em>rev\u2019d sub. nom. on other grounds Matsushita Electric Industrial Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 106 S.Ct. 1348, 89 L.Ed.2d 538 (1986); <em>Universal Minerals, Inc. v. C.A. Hughes &amp; Co., </em>669 F.2d 98, 101-02 (3d Cir.1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b530-13\">On cross-examination, Kirkland testified that prior to the start of his investigation he had no reason to believe that Engler was involved in criminal activity. The district court ruled that Kirkland\u2019s testimony on redirect that he had suspected Engler\u2019s employer of illegal activities was relevant \u201c[t]o refute any conclusion of improper motive or intent\u201d on the part of the government in initiating its investigation of En-gler. 627 F.Supp. 196, 200. This court, however, has determined:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AZ_\">at least in the context of entrapment, that \u201cit is inconsequential whether law enforcement officials did or did not act on well-grounded suspicion that the defendant was engaging in wrongdoing, or whether they had probable cause for approaching the defendant.\u201d ... Where the conduct of the investigation itself does not offend due process, the mere fact that the investigation may have been commenced without probable cause does not bar the conviction of those who rise to its bait.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b530-14\"><em>United States v. Jannotti, </em>673 F.2d 578, 609 (3d Cir.)(in banc)(citations and emphasis omitted), <em>cert. denied, </em>457 U.S. 1106, 102 S.Ct. 2906, 73 L.Ed.2d 1315 (1982). A strong case can be made, therefore, that Kirkland\u2019s testimony was irrelevant, and that the court erred in admitting it. Even so, we are not satisfied that this amounted to reversible error. In light of the formidable array of other evidence of Engler\u2019s predisposition to commit the offenses charged, it cannot reasonably be maintained that this testimony affected Engler\u2019s \u201csubstantial rights;\u201d absent prejudice to defendant, the district court\u2019s error does not constitute grounds for reversal. <em>See </em>Rule 52(a), F.R. of Crim.P.; <em>United States v. Reynolds, </em>715 F.2d 99, 104 (3d Cir.1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b531-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>V.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-5\">Accordingly, we conclude that Engler is not entitled to relief in these appeals. We now turn to the government\u2019s appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-6\">VI.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-7\">The Migratory Bird Treaty Act implements provisions of treaties between the United States and Great Britain, Mexico, and Japan for the protection of certain species of migratory birds. As originally enacted, violations of the MBTA or regulations promulgated thereunder were punishable as misdemeanors. <em>See </em>16 U.S.C. \u00a7 707(a). Scienter is not an element of criminal liability under the Act\u2019s misdemeanor provisions. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Chandler, </em>753 F.2d 360, 363 (4th Cir.1985); <em>United States v. Catlett, </em>747 F.2d 1102, 1104 (6th Cir.1984), <em>cert. denied, </em>471 U.S. 1074, 105 S.Ct. 2153, 85 L.Ed.2d 509 (1985). In 1960 the MBTA was amended to make the sale of protected species a felony. <em>See </em>16 U.S.C. \u00a7 707(b)(2). This amendment was intended to differentiate between \u201can individual who hunts migratory birds for pleasure\u201d and \u201ca person who slaughters these wildfowl for commercial purposes as a means of livelihood\u201d and therefore to \u201cbetter protect our migratory game birds.\u201d S.Rep. No. 1779, 86th Cong., 2d Sess. 1, <em>reprinted in </em>(1960) U.S. Code Cong. &amp; Ad. News 3459, 3459. The amendment did not add scienter as an element of criminal liability. In effect, the statutory schema presented two factual scenarios for imposing strict liability on those who hunt migratory birds \u2014 if the actor hunts for pleasure, it is a misdemeanor; if for commercial purposes, it is a felony.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-8\">Relying almost exclusively on <em>United States v. Wulff, </em>758 F.2d 1121 (6th Cir.1985), the district court ruled that the absence of a scienter requirement in the felony provision of the Act violates the due process clause of the fifth amendment. <em>See also United States v. St. Pierre, </em>578 F.Supp. 1424 (W.D.S.D.1983). In effect, the court condemned the strict liability feature of the Act\u2019s felony provision. On appeal, the government concedes that a scienter element is constitutionally required, but contends that the court should infer a scienter requirement from the statutory scheme and congressional purpose. The United States further argues that the indictment alleged and evidence at trial established that Engler acted \u201cknowingly,\u201d thereby obviating Engler\u2019s due process argument. Because this issue involves the application and interpretation of legal precepts, the standard of review is plenary. <em>United States v. Adams, </em>759 F.2d 1099, 1106 (3d Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 106 S.Ct. 275, 88 L.Ed.2d 236 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b531-12\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-13\">The concurrence and the government urge us to avoid the constitutional issue presented by this case. They argue that this court should supply the missing element of scienter to the MBTA\u2019s felony provision, recognize that this element was proven at trial, and, on this basis, remand to the district court for reinstatement of the indictments. This we cannot do. We agree with the district court that to supply an element of specific intent here would be impermissible \u201cjudicial legislation.\u201d 627 F.Supp. at 199.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-14\">It is of course well established that \u201c[t]he existence of mens rea is the rule of, rather than the exception to, the principles of Anglo-American criminal jurisprudence.\u201d <em>Dennis v. United States, </em>341 U.S. 494, 500, 71 S.Ct. 857, 862, 95 L.Ed. 1137 (1951). The Supreme Court, however, has long recognized that a different standard applies to those federal criminal statues that are essentially regulatory, that are designed to protect the public welfare, and that do not have their origins in the common law. With respect to these offenses, \u201cwhatever the intent of the violator, the injury is the same... [L]egislation applicable to such offenses, as a matter of policy, does not specify intent as a necessary element.\u201d <em>Morissette v. United States, </em>342 U.S. 246, 252, 72 S.Ct. 240, 244, 96 L.Ed. 288 (1952). Thus, the \u201cinterpretative presumption ... in favor of implying a scienter requirement into an otherwise silent statute,\u201d concur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>ence at 438, more appropriately arises where the offense is one, taken from the common law, that historically includes mens rea. <em>Morissette, </em>342 U.S. at 262, 72 S.Ct. at 249; <em>accord United States v. Johnson &amp; Towers, Inc., </em>741 F.2d 662, 665 (3d Cir.1984) (\u201c[T]hough the result may appear harsh, it is well established that criminal penalties attached to regulatory statutes intended to protect public health, in contrast to statutes based on common law crimes, are to be construed to effectuate the regulatory purpose.\u201d), <em>cert. denied, </em>469 U.S. 1208, 105 S.Ct. 1171, 84 L.Ed.2d 321 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b532-4\">As noted above, the MBTA is a regulatory measure designed to protect the public welfare, derived not from the common law but from a series of treaties with other states. <em>Missouri v. Holland, </em>252 U.S. 416, 435, 40 S.Ct. 382, 384, 64 L.Ed. 641 (1920). Guided by the factors articulated in <em>Morissette, </em>we cannot conclude that the text or history of the Act provides a basis from which to infer an intent requirement.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Our reluctance to draw such an inference is bolstered by case law interpreting the MBTA as imposing strict liability. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Catlett, </em>747 F.2d 1102 (6th Cir.1984), <em>cert. denied, </em>471 U.S. 1074, 105 S.Ct. 2153, 85 L.Ed.2d 509 (1985); <em>United States v.

Finally, we do not believe that the appearance of the word \u201cdeterrent\u201d in the legislative history of the Act\u2019s felony provision provides sufficient ground to conclude that Congress intended scienter as an element of the offense.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Because we do not believe that this court may rewrite the felony provision of the MBTA to include an intent requirement, we must decide whether the district court erred in holding that the Act, as written, is unconstitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-8\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-9\">The Sixth Circuit\u2019s <em>Wulff </em>opinion builds on the Eighth Circuit\u2019s decision in <em>Holdridge v. United States, </em>282 F.2d 302 (8th Cir.1960), which in turn adopted the philosophy of <em>Morissette v. United States, </em>342 U.S. 246, 72 S.Ct. 240, 96 L.Ed. 288 (1952). <em>Morissette </em>teaches that proof of intent is not necessary where \u201cpenalties ... are relatively small, and conviction does no grave danger to an offender\u2019s reputation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 256, 72 S.Ct. at 246. Similarly, <em>Holdridge </em>explained that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b533-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>where a federal criminal statute omits mention of intent and where it seems to involve what is basically a matter of policy, where the standard imposed is, under the circumstances, reasonable and adherence thereto properly expected of a person, where the penalty is relatively small, where conviction does not gravely besmirch, where the statutory crime is not one taken over from the common law, and where congressional purpose is supporting, the statute can be construed as one not requiring criminal intent. The elimination of this element is then not violative of the due process clause.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b533-5\">288 F.2d at 310. The inverse of this proposition, also relied on by the district court, was set forth in dictum in <em>United States v. Heller, </em>579 F.2d 990, 994 (6th Cir.1978): \u201cCertainly, if Congress attempted to define a <em>malum prohibitum </em>offense that placed an onerous stigma on an offender\u2019s reputation and that carried a severe penalty, the Constitution would be offended....\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b533-7\">The district court accepted this reasoning <em>in toto </em>and determined that because a person acting with an innocent state of mind could be subject to a severe penalty \u2014 here, two years imprisonment, a $2,000 fine or both under the felony provision \u2014 due pro-, cess requires the prosecutor to prove that the accused acted with some degree of scienter; and that because Congress failed so to provide, section 707(b)(2) fails to pass constitutional muster. Significantly, the district court made no reference to other strict liability statutes that impose equally or more severe penalties, statutes judged by the Supreme Court to survive constitutional scrutiny.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-8\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-9\">We are somewhat uncomfortable with the government\u2019s concession that the absence of a scienter requirement in the felony provision of the Migratory Bird Treaty Act violates the due process clause. This court, however, is not bound by the government\u2019s concession. Rather, we are mindful of our obligation to afford congressional enactments the benefit of all reasonable arguments in favor of constitutionality. <em>See St. Martin Evangelical Lutheran Church, </em>451 U.S. 772, 780, 101 S.Ct. 2142, 2147, 68 L.Ed.2d 612 (1981); <em>Lehigh &amp; New England Ry.

It is well established that a criminal statute is not necessarily rendered unconstitutional because its definition of a felony lacks the element of scienter. <em>See Lambert v. California, </em>355 U.S. 225, 228, 78 S.Ct. 240, 242, 2 L.Ed.2d 228 (1957)(\u201cWe do not go with Blackstone in saying that a \u2018vicious will\u2019 is necessary to constitute a crime ... for conduct alone without regard to the intent of the doer is often sufficient.

North Carolina, </em>325 U.S. 226, 238, 65 S.Ct. 1092, 1099, 89 L.Ed. 1577 (1945)(\u201cThe objection that punishment of a person for an act as a crime when ignorant of the facts making it so, involves a denial of due process of law has more than once been overruled.\u201d); <em>Shevlin-Carpenter Co. v.

The Supreme Court has indicated that the due process clause may set some limits on the imposition of strict criminal liability, but it has not set forth definite guidelines as to what those limits might be. <em>See United States v.

They hold that the differences between a felony fine of $2,000 and a misdemeanor fine of $500, between a two-year felony sentence and a six-month misdemeanor sentence, between the stigma of a felony conviction and that of a misdemeanor conviction turn the trick on constitutionality.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Mechanical jurisprudence has no place here. The constitutionality of acts of Congress should not be determined by such nice distinctions, with tight mathematical formulas derived from a pocket calculator or a computer spread sheet. The differences between the objective penalties of the misdemeanor and felony provisions of the Act is, for due process purposes, <em>de minimis. </em>Moreover, we are unwilling to accept that it is axiomatic, or proved by experience or empirical data, that there is, in the <em>Morissette </em>formulation, a \u201cgrave danger to an offender\u2019s reputation\u201d when he is sentenced to two years imprisonment (eight months actual incarceration) under the felony provision, but no such danger when he is sentenced to six months imprisonment (six months actual incarceration) under the misdemeanor provision. Nor should the differences in the fines compel the conclusion that one\u2019s reputation is not besmirched by a $500 fine, but is unconstitutionally tarnished by an additional levy of $1500.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-5\">The concurrence argues that the \u201cqualitative\u201d difference between a felony and a misdemeanor conviction under the Act is constitutionally significant. Concurrence, at 439-40. In <em>United States v. Green-baum, </em>138 F.2d 437 (3d Cir.1943), however, this court expressly rejected reasoning similar to that of <em>Wulff, St. Pierre, </em>the district court here and the concurrence. Although the defendants in <em>Greenbaum </em>were apparently charged under the misdemeanor provisions of a statute prohibiting the introduction of impure food into interstate commerce, the court noted that the statute included felony provisions for repeat offenders. <em>Id. </em>at 438 n. 1. In affirming that the mere absence of an intent requirement did not violate due process, the court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b534-8\">While the absence of any requirement of mens rea is usually met with in statutes punishing minor or police offenses (for which fines, at least in the first instance, are ordinarily the penalties), <em>we think that interpretation of legislative intent as dispensing with the knowledge and wilfulness as elements of specified crimes is not to be restricted to offenses differentiable upon their relative lack of turpitude. </em>Where the offenses prohibited and made punishable are capable of inflicting widespread injury, and where the requirement of proof of the offender\u2019s guilty knowledge and wrongful intent would render enforcement of the prohibition difficult if not impossible (i.e., in effect tend to nullify the statute), the legislative intent to dispense with mens rea as an element of the offense has justifiable basis.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b534-9\"><em>Id. </em>at 438 (emphasis supplied). <em>See also Shevlin-Carpenter, Inc., </em>218 U.S. at 70, 30 S.Ct. at 667 (\u201c[LJegislation may, in particular instances be harsh, but we can only say again what we have so often said, that this court cannot set aside legislation because it is harsh.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b534-10\">To decide cases on constitutional law, to be sure, is to draw lines and to make judg<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>ment calls. But where differences between misdemeanor and felony penalties are as close as they are here, we feel that the analysis takes place on a very slippery slope with too much \u201cin the eye of the beholder.\u201d Too much subjectivity abides in such an approach to rely on such fine distinctions as are present here.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Accordingly, we reject the analysis of the district court, and elect not to follow the approach of the Sixth Circuit.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-5\">D.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-6\">This does not end our analysis. We prefer instead to draw what we consider to be proper analogies from those cases reviewing the constitutionality of other strict liability crimes. The Supreme Court and the Fifth and Seventh Circuits have affirmed the constitutionality of strict liability crimes carrying penalties of equivalent or greater severity than those at issue here. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Freed, </em>401 U.S. 601, 91 S.Ct. 1112, 28 L.Ed.2d 356 (1971) (possession of unregistered firearm; fines up to $10,000 and/or imprisonment up to ten years); <em>Williams v.

Freed. </em>There, the Court distinguished two types of strict liability crimes. Strict liability for omissions which are not <em>\u201cper se </em>blameworthy\u201d may violate due process because such derelictions are \u201c \u2018unlike the commission of acts, or the failure to act under circumstances that should alert the doer to the consequences of his deed.\u2019 \u201d 401 U.S. at 608, 91 S.Ct. at 1118, quoting <em>Lambert v. California, </em>355 U.S. at 228, 78 S.Ct. at 243 (law imposing strict criminal liability on convicted felons who fail to register when remaining in Los Angeles for more than five days violates due process). By contrast, due process is not violated by the imposition of strict liability as part of \u201ca regulatory measure in the interest of public safety, which may well be premised on the theory that one would hardly be surprised to learn that [the prohibited conduct] is not an innocent act.\u201d 401 U.S. at 609, 91 S.Ct. at 1118, citing <em>United States v. Dotterweich </em>(shipping adulterated and misbranded drugs) and <em>United States v. Balint </em>(selling narcotics).</p>\n<p id=\"b535-10\">The capture and sale of species protected by the MBTA is not \u201cconduct that is wholly passive,\u201d but more closely resembles con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>duct \u201cthat one would hardly be surprised to learn ... is not innocent.\u201d The prohibition of such sales furthers \u201ca national interest of very nearly the first magnitude.\u201d <em>Missouri v. Holland, </em>252 U.S. 416, 435, 40 S.Ct. 382, 384, 64 L.Ed. 641 (1920). Under the <em>Freed </em>test, the strict liability provisions of the MBTA do not offend the requirements of due process. We so hold.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-4\">VII.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-5\">The judgment of the district court dismissing the Migratory Bird Treaty Act indictments will be reversed and the case remanded to the district court with a direction to reinstate the jury\u2019s verdict of guilty and to proceed with sentencing.

The Court determined that proof of the offender's knowledge of the illegality of his actions was a necessary element of a criminal prosecution under the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-6\">Due process was not at issue in <em>Liparota. </em>Unlike the provisions of the MBTA it was undisputed that section 2024(b) contained <em>some </em>scien-ter requirement. <em>Id. </em>105 S.Ct. at 2087; <em>see </em>7 U.S.C. \u00a7 2024(b) (\"[Wjhoever <em>knowingly </em>uses, transfers, acquires, alters, or possesses coupons or authorization cards in a manner not authorized by this chapter ... shall ... be guilty of a felony____\u201d) (emphasis supplied). The only issue was the precise nature of that requirement. Moreover, the Court in <em>Liparota </em>specifically held that section 2024(b) was not the type of offense subject to the analysis of <em>United States v. Freed, </em>401 U.S. 601, 91 S.Ct. 1112, 28 L.Ed.2d 356 (1971). <em>See Liparota, </em>105 S.Ct. at 2092.

See infra </em>at 441.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b532-12\">. Similarly, we do not find support in the legislative history for the Sixth Circuit\u2019s statement that when adding the felony provision to the MBTA, \u201c[i]t is quite likely that Congress omitted to require proof of scienter due to oversight.\u201d <em>United States v.

Rather, the courts there appear to have established a bright-line rule: the onerous stigma necessarily conferred by any felony conviction will always violate due process if liability is not predicated on scienter. <em>See Wulff, </em>758 at 1125, 1125 n. 2 (\"a felony conviction irreparably damages one\u2019s reputation,\u2019\u2019 <em>citing Morissette, </em>342 U.S. at 260, 72 S.Ct. at 248 (\u201c[T]he infamy is that of a felony, which, says Maitland, is \u2019... as bad a word as you can give to a man or thing.\u2019\u201d)); <em>St. Pierre, </em>578 F.Supp. at 1429 (\u201cThere can be no question but that a felony conviction irreparably damages a person's reputation in this respect.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b535-7\">. It is not necessary for us to draw a bright line where the <em>Morissette </em>formulation may properly be triggered, but we would be more comfortable in doing so if the misdemeanor/felony difference were substantially more pronounced, as, for example, at common law. Felonies were defined at common law as crimes that had the potential of being punishable by death. These offenses included homicide, mayhem, arson, rape, robbery, burglary, larceny, prison breach and rescue of a felon. Although this common law list was greatly enlarged by statute, Parliament continued to emphasize capital punishment as the chief characteristic of a felony. \"Misdemeanor\" was the label ultimately applied to all other, non-capital offenses. <em>See </em>R. Perkins &amp; R. Boyce, <em>Criminal Law, </em>13-15 (3d ed. 1982), citing 4 W.

Because the majority gratuitously and, I think, ill-advisedly concludes that the felony provisions of the MBTA satisfy the requirements of due process even if construed to impose strict liability, I write separately to express my views.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-8\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-9\">The government appeals from the district court\u2019s determination that because the felony provisions of the MBTA impose harsh penalties and conviction thereunder \u201cgravely besmirch[es]\u201d the offender\u2019s reputation, <em>Holdridge v. United States, </em>282 F.2d 302, 310 (8th Cir.1960), the absence of a scienter requirement offends due process.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-10\">Engler was indicted, <em>inter alia, </em>for violations of the MBTA, 16 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 703 and 707(b), in two separate indictments. After the jury returned a verdict of guilty on all charges, Engler filed a motion for permission to challenge the constitutionality of \u00a7 707(b)(2) based on the intervening decision of the Sixth Circuit in <em>United States v. Wulff, </em>758 F.2d 1121 (6th Cir.1985). In <em>Wulff </em>the Sixth Circuit held the felony provisions of the MBTA unconstitutional reasoning that the absence of an express scienter requirement violates a defendant\u2019s right to due process. In reliance on <em>Wulff, </em>the district court in the instant appeal dismissed the felony indictments against En-gler.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-12\">The government advances a three-prong argument which it maintains mandates reversal of the district court\u2019s holding. First, the government argues that \u201cthe purpose of amending the MBTA to provide felony penalties for commercial exploitation of migratory birds was to distinguish between the pleasure hunter and those who kill birds as part of a business enterprise.\u201d Opening Brief for the United States at 8. The government considers this distinction significant in determining the meaning of \u00a7 707(b)(2) of the MBTA. In that regard the government argues that the \u201cdistrict court\u2019s conclusion that Section 707(b)(2) contains no scienter requirement essentially equates the offenses covered by that section with the general misdemeanor provisions of Section 707(a). The implication of a scienter requirement into the felony provision, on the other hand,\u201d the government maintains, \u201cfurthers the apparent congressional intent to distinguish between the offenses covered by the two provisions.\u201d Opening Brief for the United States at 9 (footnotes omitted). Second, the government argues that this court is not constrained either by case law in this circuit or Supreme Court precedent from implying a scienter element into the felony provisions of the MBTA. Finally, the government concludes by arguing that the evidence presented to the district court firmly establishes that Engler knowingly violated the law, thereby satisfying the scienter requirement it urges us to imply.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-13\">The district court\u2019s post-trial conclusion that \u00a7 707(b)(2) contains no scienter requirement was based on its understanding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>of judicial power in construing ambiguous Congressional legislation. The court reasoned that (1) before a court may imply criminal intent as an element of a statute that is silent on the issue it must look to the intent of Congress, (2) that nothing in the legislative history of the MBTA (as construed in <em>Missouri v. Holland, </em>252 U.S. 416, 40 S.Ct. 382, 64 L.Ed. 641 (1920)), suggests that Congress intended scienter as an element, and finally that (3) because Congress intended no scienter requirement for the felony provision of MBTA that a) carries a serious penalty and b) gravely besmirches the reputation of an offender, that provision offends the due process clause of the Fifth Amendment. The district court refused to save the felony provision from constitutional infirmity, noting instead that \u201c[t]o include a specific intent requirement would be judicial legislation.\u201d App. at 43.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-5\">In essence, the government simply asks us to determine whether the district court erred in not implying a scienter requirement in the felony provision of the MBTA. \u201c[S]omewhat uncomfortable with the government\u2019s apparent concession that the absence of a scienter requirement in the felony provision of the Migratory Bird Treaty Act violates the due process clause,\u201d Maj. at 433, however, the majority addresses the more difficult issue whether scienter <em>must </em>be an included element of a felony offense under the MBTA. Dismissing as \u201c[m]echanical jurisprudence,\u201d Maj. at 434, the distinctions drawn between the misdemeanor and felony penalties, the majority concludes that the \u201cclose\u201d difference between the misdemean- or and felony penalties of the MBTA cannot \u201cturn the trick on constitutionality.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Rather, the majority holds that because \u201csale of species protected by the MBTA is not \u2018conduct that is wholly passive,\u2019 but more closely resembles conduct \u2018that one would hardly be surprised to learn ... is not innocent,\u2019 ... the strict liability provisions of the MBTA do not offend the requirements of due process.\u201d Maj. at 435. Because I think this is an issue we need not, and should not, address on the facts of this case, and more important, because I believe it is far from clear that the Supreme Court would adopt similar reasoning, I respectfully depart from the majority\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-8\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-9\">As recognized by the majority, federal courts have an \u201cobligation to afford congressional enactments the benefit of all reasonable arguments in favor of constitutionality.\u201d Maj. at 433 (citing <em>St. Martin Evangelical Lutheran Church, </em>451 U.S. 772, 780, 101 S.Ct. 2142, 2147, 68 L.Ed.2d 612 (1981)). In the instant appeal, the government reasonably argues that the 1960 amendment to the MBTA prescribing felony penalties for the commercial exploitation of migratory birds implicitly contains a scienter requirement thereby distinguishing it from the misdemeanor penalties under the Act. Thus, the government asserts, the district court should have implied a scienter requirement into the felony provisions of the MBTA. This position is bolstered by the recent decision of the Supreme Court in <em>Liparota v. United States, </em>471 U.S. 419, 105 S.Ct. 2084, 85 L.Ed.2d 434 (1985). <em>Liparota </em>addressed the question whether in a prosecution under the federal statute governing food stamp fraud the government was required to prove not only that a defendant knowingly acquired or possessed food stamps but <em>also </em>that s/he knew that s/he did so in an unauthorized manner. In the course of interpreting the statute there at issue the Court noted that \u201c \u2018[cjertainly far more than the simple omission of the appropriate phrase from the statutory definition is necessary to justify dispensing with an intent requirement\u2019 and that criminal offenses requiring no <em>mens rea </em>have a \u2018generally disfavored status.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>105 S.Ct. at 2088 (quoting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number><em>United States v. United States Gypsum, </em>438 U.S. 422, 98 S.Ct. 2864, 57 L.Ed.2d 854 (1978)).</p>\n<p id=\"b538-4\">In general, then, the interpretative presumption is in favor of implying a scienter requirement into an otherwise silent statute. <em>See </em>Opening Brief for the United States at 13. In particular, it is my judgment that the legislative history of the specific statutory provision here at issue, <em>viz. </em>section 707(b)(2), suggests that while Congress sought to impose more severe penalties on commercial offenders of the MBTA, it sought to do so only where those offenders exhibited <em>some </em>degree of culpability.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The legislative history states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"azl-dedup-0\">that heavier penalties, together with the forfeiture of boats, guns, and other equipment used by <em>commercial </em>hunters should be a deterrent to those engaged in this illegal traffic, and is a needed addition to existing law. On the other hand, ... not ... every purchaser of migratory birds should be exposed to such a heavy penalty.... [Rather, they] should be subject to ... the misdemeanor fine of up to $500, imprisonment of up to 6 months, or both....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b538-7\">S.Rep. No. 1779, 86th Cong., 2d Sess. 1, <em>reprinted in </em>(1960) U.S. Code &amp; Ad.News 3459, 3460 (emphasis added). Contrary to the majority\u2019s assertion that the \u201cstatutory schema presented two factual scenarios for imposing strict liability\u201d under the misdemeanor and felony provisions of the MBTA, Congress\u2019s express desire to <em>deter </em>commercial exploitation of migratory birds implicates culpable as opposed to innocent conduct as the target of the felony provisions. In other words, Congress was more concerned with the deliberate slaughter of migratory birds for profit. Thus, as a matter of statutory construction, I would hold that the district court erred in failing to imply a scienter requirement in \u00a7 707(b)(2) of the MBTA, and accordingly, it was error to dismiss the indictment pursuant to that provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-13\">I note that the posture in which this case reaches this court, as a prudential matter, also encourages this approach. We are not faced here with the pre-trial dismissal of an indictment on the ground that it charges the defendant under a provision deemed to be unconstitutional as in <em>Wulff. </em>Instead, we are asked to consider the propriety of the district court\u2019s actions in dismissing the indictment <em>after </em>a full trial on the merits. Moreover, the indictment charged Engler with \u201cknowingly\u201d violating the statute and the court charged the jury accordingly. Thus, if the evidence in fact established \u201cknowledge,\u201d as the government contends, all that due process requires was met in this case. We need not reach the question whether as a matter of constitutional law scienter is a <em>required </em>element of a felony offense under the MBTA.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Were we com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>pelled to do so, however, I would remain unpersuaded by the reasoning employed by the majority to conclude that \u00a7 707(b)(2), construed as a strict liability provision, satisfies the demands of due process.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-6\"><em>Morissette v. United States, </em>342 U.S. 246, 72 S.Ct. 240, 96 L.Ed. 288 (1952) sanctions strict liability crimes where \u201cpenalties ... are relatively small, and conviction does no grave danger to an offender\u2019s reputation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 256, 72 S.Ct. at 246. Focusing primarily on the severity of the penalty prong of the <em>Morissette </em>calculus, the majority concludes that the marginal differences between the possible sentences under the misdemeanor and felony provisions of the MBTA are not differences that make a difference as a matter of constitutional law. Although I would not lend my unqualified support to the majority\u2019s analysis of the quantitative distinction between a sentence under the felony provisions of the MBTA in contrast to a misdemeanor sentence, my concern is with the cursory fashion in which it deals with the second prong of the <em>Morissette </em>calculus, <em>viz. </em>the damage to reputation factor. Because I believe that there are very serious, tangible, collateral consequences that attach to one\u2019s reputation as a convicted felon, I would require at least a minimal showing of intent before an accused is convicted under \u00a7 707(b)(2), which, I believe, proscribes neither a \u201cpublic welfare offense\u201d <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> nor conduct that the ordinary citizen would recognize as wrong.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-7\">The majority\u2019s reluctance to recognize a due process concern at the second level of <em>Morissette </em>stems from its belief that \u201cit is [not] axiomatic, or proved by experience or empirical data, that there is, in the <em>Moris-sette </em>formulation, a \u2018grave danger to an offender\u2019s reputation\u2019 \u201d when sentenced to a longer term of imprisonment under the felony provisions of the MBTA. Maj. at 434. The majority\u2019s focus again is on the <em>quantitative </em>differences between the possible sentences under the two provisions. Shifting the focus to the <em>qualitative </em>differences between conviction pursuant to the two provisions, however, I cannot conclude with sanguinity that a conviction under a strict liability felony provision of the MBTA does not offend due process.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-10\">During oral argument some concern was expressed as to our ability to recognize the collateral consequences of felony convictions; consequences which I think highlight the qualitative differences between convictions under \u00a7 707(a) and (b):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b539-11\">MR. CAMPANA: ... I think, therefore, there is a significant difference between a misdemeanor and a felony.:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b539-12\">MR. CAMPANA: Just because of the word \u201cfelony\u201d; the connotation of the word \u201cfelony.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b539-13\">THE COURT: Just because the word is a label you\u2019re saying?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b539-14\">MR. CAMPANA: Your Honor, we go through life\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b539-15\">THE COURT: As distinguished from a person that\u2019s been in jail on whatever the diminished term is, that a misdemeanor would carry the difference there?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b539-16\">MR. CAMPANA: I think there is a big difference. When you fill out a job application, they want to know if you were convicted of a felony. When you <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>fill out an application for admission to college, they want to know if you were convicted of a felony.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b540-4\">THE COURT: I think it goes also a bit further: [They ask,] [h]ave you ever been arrested?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b540-5\">MR. CAMPANA: Then they ask the next question: Felony or misdemeanor? They make a distinction \u2014 everyday in life \u2014 between a felony and misdemean- or. They don\u2019t look at the divergent penalties involved; they look at the label. Yes, they do.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b540-7\">THE COURT: As to the extent of opprobrium between felony and misdemean- or, is this a matter which we take judicial notice of? This is a judicial notice [concept]?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b540-8\">MR. CAMPANA: I think so, Your Hon- or. I think it\u2019s a matter of widespread knowledge.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b540-9\">Indeed, the Supreme Court has long recognized in other contexts the private discrimination and civil disabilities that often befall a convicted felon. As Chief Justice Earl Warren noted in his dissenting opinion in <em>Parker v. Ellis, </em>362 U.S. 574, 80 S.Ct. 909, 4 L.Ed.2d 963 (1960), \u201c[c]onviction of a felony imposes a <em>status </em>upon a person which not only makes him vulnerable to future sanctions through new civil disability statutes, but which also seriously affects his reputation and economic opportunities.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 593-94, 80 S.Ct. at 920. <em>See generally </em>Special Project, <em>The Collateral Consequences of a Criminal Conviction, </em>23 Vand.L.Rev. 929 (1970); Note, <em>Civil Disabilities of Felons, </em>53 Va.L.Rev. 403 (1967). Although it may be unclear in a given case what specific disabilities may attach to a felony conviction, it is \u201cthe obvious fact of life that most criminal convictions do entail adverse collateral legal consequences.\u201d <em>Sibron v. New York, </em>392 U.S. 40, 55, 88 S.Ct. 1889, 1899, 20 L.Ed.2d 917 (1968). <em>See also Tuten v. United States, </em>460 U.S. 660, 663-64 &amp; n. 7,103 S.Ct. 1412, 1414-15 &amp; n. 7, 75 L.Ed.2d 359 (1983) (recognizing in general, the collateral consequences of felony convictions); <em>Missouri v. Hunter, </em>459 U.S. 359, 372, 103 S.Ct. 673, 681, 74 L.Ed.2d 535 (1983) (Marshall, J., dissenting) (noting the collateral consequences in the context of a first-degree robbery conviction); <em>Lane v. Williams, </em>455 U.S. 624, 630-33, 102 S.Ct. 1322, 1326-28, 71 L.Ed.2d 508 (1982) (acknowledging the existence of collateral consequences but holding that they do not attach to recorded parole violations); <em>id. </em>at 634,102 S.Ct. at 1328 (Marshall, J., dissenting) (noting that the Supreme \u201cCourt has consistently refused to canvass state law to ascertain \u2018the actual existence of specific collateral consequences,\u2019 and has presumed that such consequences exist\u201d); <em>Baldasar v. Illinois, </em>446 U.S. 222, 226-27, 100 S.Ct. 1585, 1587-88, 64 L.Ed.2d 169 (1980) (per curiam) (Marshall, J., concurring) (noting in passing \u201call the serious collateral consequences that a felony convictions entails\u201d); <em>Blackledge v. Perry, </em>417 U.S. 21, 28 n. 7, 94 S.Ct. 2098, 2103 n. 7, 40 L.Ed.2d 628 (1974) (observing that \u201cconviction of a \u2018felony\u2019 often entails more serious collateral consequences than those incurred through a misdemeanor conviction\u201d); <em>Baldwin v. New York, </em>399 U.S. 66, 69, 90 S.Ct. 1886, 1888, 26 L.Ed.2d 437 (1970) (noting \u201c[a]s in most States, ... in New York ... the collateral consequences attaching to a felony conviction are more severe than those attaching to a conviction for a misdemeanor\u201d); <em>Benton v. Maryland, </em>395 U.S. 784, 790, 89 S.Ct. 2056, 2060, 23 L.Ed.2d 707 (1969) (generally noting the adverse legal consequences of felony convictions); <em>Sibron, </em>392 U.S. at 55, 88 S.Ct. at 1898 (reviewing Supreme Court case law development on the question of collateral consequences of criminal convictions and noting that \u201cthe Court abandoned all inquiry into the actual existence of specific collateral consequences and in effect presumed that they existed.\u201d). Thus, it has been traditionally recognized that collateral consequences of felony convictions are both inevitable and serious.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-11\">Notwithstanding the grave consequences that attach to any felony conviction, it is true that the Supreme Court has not held that felony convictions may be had only upon proof of scienter. Indeed, it has never squarely confronted the issue. In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number><em>Williams v. North Carolina, </em>325 U.S. 226, 65 S.Ct. 1092, 89 L.Ed. 1577 (1944), the Court upheld felony bigamy convictions in part because \u201c[mistaken notions about one\u2019s legal rights are not sufficient to bar prosecution for crime.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 238, 65 S.Ct. at 1099. The <em>Williams </em>Court was not asked to consider the nature of the penalty imposed for violation of the state bigamy statute or the ramifications thereof; rather, the Court was asked to decide whether, under the circumstances of that case, the petitioners could be penalized at all.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Similarly, in <em>Lambert v. California, </em>355 U.S. 225, 78 S.Ct. 240, 2 L.Ed.2d 228 (1957), the Court\u2019s concern was with the criminalization of \u201cconduct that is wholly passive.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 228, 78 S.Ct. at 243. Although the Court addressed the issue of due process, its emphasis was on the nature of the conduct punished as opposed to the nature of penalty itself. Under <em>Lambert, </em>any penalty \u2014 whether felony or misdemeanor \u2014 for \u201cwholly passive\u201d conduct would not have been sanctioned. <em>United States v. Freed, </em>401 U.S. 601, 91 S.Ct. 1112, 28 L.Ed.2d 356 (1971), <em>United States v. Dotterweich, </em>320 U.S. 277, 64 S.Ct. 134, 88 L.Ed. 48 (1943), and <em>United States v. Balint, </em>258 U.S. 250, 42 S.Ct. 301, 66 L.Ed. 604 (1922), cited by the majority, <em>see </em>maj. at 435, are all distinguishable from this case in that they regulate conduct that poses a threat to the public safety. The protection of migratory birds, albeit a legitimate issue of public concern, can hardly be equated with the health and safety concerns associated with hand-grenades and drug distribution. Finally, although the Court in <em>Shevlin-Car-penter Co. v. Minnesota, </em>218 U.S. 57, 30 S.Ct. 663, 54 L.Ed. 930 (1910), acknowledged that public policy may sometimes require non-recognition of defenses of ignorance or good-faith, the Court has since limited the category of those offenses in which the strict criminal liability may be imposed. <em>See United States v. United States Gypsum Co., </em>438 U.S. 422, 436-38, 98 S.Ct. 2864, 2873-74, 57 L.Ed.2d 854 (1978). A violation of the MBTA simply does not fall into the category of felony offenses that the Supreme Court has recognized as constitutional without proof of scienter. Namely, the sale of bird parts is neither a public welfare offense nor conduct that an average person would realize was criminal, much less felonious. Had the majority properly considered the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Liparota </em>perhaps these distinctions would have been evident. <em>See </em>105 S.Ct. at 2092. Instead, it creates a new category of strict liability felony offenses to which any unsuspecting citizen may fall prey.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-7\">Under the majority\u2019s approach an unassuming tourist who, without knowledge that a particular bird is a protected species, picks up a carcass from alongside the highway may be subject to a felony conviction and all of the attendant consequences if s/he later sells or offers to sale the bird to a government agent, or even an admiring neighbor. I simply cannot join in a \u201cjudgment call[ ]\u201d that permits such a result. As recognized by the majority \u201c[t]he Supreme Court has indicated that due process may set some limits on the imposition of strict criminal liability.\u201d Maj. typescript at 433. I do not think that this case presents us with the opportunity to determine precisely what those limits should be. On this record, however, no due process violation has occurred. I would reverse the judgment of the district court dismissing the indictment under the felony provisions and remand for resentencing.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b537-6\">. The majority attempts to minimize the significance of <em>Liparota </em>by noting that \"[d]ue process was not at issue in <em>Liparota.\" </em>Maj. at 432 n. 2. It is precisely because of the <em>Liparota </em>Court\u2019s recognition of and allegiance to the above-quoted principle, however, that the due process issue <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>was averted. Similarly, in the instant case, as acknowledged by <em>both </em>parties, recognition of a minimum culpability requirement would satisfy the demands of due process. (Of course, Engler does <em>not </em>challenge the propriety of a scienter requirement as an element of a \u00a7 707(b)(2) offense. Rather, he challenges both the power of Congress to omit it and the authority of the courts to imply it.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b538-9\">. The government similarly construes the statute to require some culpability. At oral argument the following colloquy took place:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b538-10\">THE COURT: ... What is the Government\u2019s position as to how the implied scienter comes into this case?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b538-11\">MS. MCGUIRE: Your Honor, the scienter requirement would be that a defendant knows that he is selling a bird or bird parts, and that bird or bird parts generally are protected by federal law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"aqd-dedup-0\">THE COURT: And there are two pieces: One, the bird, and the selling of it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Aob\">MS. MCGUIRE: Right. And in fact if someone sold, let\u2019s say a necklace made of hawk talons, but in fact was acting under a good-faith belief that they were made from some man-made, let's say plastic, that that would be a good defense to a prosecution if they in fact could establish thal.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ay7-dedup-0\">THE COURT: ... If you were to condense this whole argument to say how we\u2019re finding implied scienter, what would you say?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Avl\">MS. MCGUIRE: That in order to be convicted of a felony under this statute, a defendant must act knowingly that what he sold was a bird or bird parts, and that, in fact, bird or bird parts were protected by law.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b538-18\">. Assuming <em>arguendo </em>that scienter is not an element of \u00a7 707(b)(2), in the instant appeal the government merely overproved its case. I emphasize that this appeal comes to us after a full <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>trial on the merits. The indictment clearly charged Engler with a knowing violation, and, by virtue of his entrapment defense, Engler concedes all elements of the offense with which he is charged. Moreover, during oral argument, counsel for appellant acknowledged that the \u201cknowingly instruction given to the jury was consistent with a construction of the MBTA that required proof of scienter before one could be convicted under the felony provisions of that statute. Thus, there is no impediment to our directing reinstatement of the convictions of Engler pursuant to \u00a7 707(b)(2) and remanding for resentencing.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b539-18\">.
