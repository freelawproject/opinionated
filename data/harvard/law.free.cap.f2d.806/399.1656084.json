(\u201cSears\u201d) and five of its financial service subsidiary companies, Allstate Insurance Company (\u201cAllstate\u201d), Allstate Life Insurance Company (\u201cAllstate Life\u201d), Allstate Enterprises, Inc. (\u201cAEI\u201d), Coldwell, Banker &amp; Company (\u201cColdwell Banker\u201d), and Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. (\u201cDean Witter\u201d), from a judgment of the United States District Court for the District of Connecticut, Jose A. Cabranes, <em>Judge, </em>641 F.Supp. 878, upholding the constitutionality of a Connecticut banking statute, Conn.Gen.Stat.Ann. \u00a7 36-5a(a)-(d) (West Supp.1986), (the \u201cAct\u201d), which regulates the manner and extent to which bank or savings and loan holding companies may establish offices in the State of Connecticut.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Appellants have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>challenged the constitutionality of the Act as applied to them on Commerce Clause and Supremacy Clause grounds. For the reasons below, we affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-4\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b501-5\">Three subsections of the Act, section 36-5a(b), (c) and (d), are in issue here. Generally, these provisions establish a regulatory scheme that affects all banks and savings and loan associations (\u201cS &amp; L\u2019s\u201d), corporations that own one or more banks or S &amp; L\u2019s, and the non-banking subsidiaries of such corporations. The Act requires these organizations to obtain permission from the Commissioner of the Connecticut Department of Banking (\u201cCommissioner\u201d) prior to opening any office in Connecticut. Subsection (b) establishes a general prohibition precluding these organizations from engaging in \u201cbanking business\u201d, which is defined under the subsection as including the following activities: \u201creceiving deposits, paying checks, lending money and any activity which is determined by the Commissioner to be so closely related to banking as to be a proper incident thereto\u201d, without the permission of the Commissioner.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b501-9\">Subsection (c) provides six exceptions to the general prohibition of subsection (b), three of which are relevant here. The first exception allows the subsidiaries of banks, stock S &amp; L\u2019s, mutual savings banks or mutual S &amp; L\u2019s organized under the laws of Connecticut or having their principal place of business located in the State of Connecticut to open offices without the permission of the Commissioner. Conn.Gen. Stat.Ann. \u00a7 36-5a(c)(3) (West Supp.1986). This exception to the applicability of the general prohibition against \u201cbanking business\u201d is available as long as the subsidiary\u2019s activity is limited to one or more of the functions which its parent organization may carry on directly through the exercise of its express or implied powers under state law.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-10\">The second such exception is a grandfather provision relieving all \u201cholding companies\u201d and their subsidiaries from the statute\u2019s application for all offices that were authorized and in fact engaged in banking <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>business prior to June 1, 1984. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 36-5a(c)(4).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b502-4\">The final relevant exception to the application of the general prohibition against \u201cbanking business\u201d is stated in subsection (d) and is incorporated by reference into subsection (c). <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 36-5a(c)(6). Under this exception firms that are otherwise precluded from opening offices engaged in banking business in Connecticut are allowed to open two such offices per year in Connecticut provided that those offices do not engage in \u201cdeposit services\u201d. Deposit services are defined by subsection (d) to include \u201cdeposits, withdrawals, advances, payments and transfers of funds to or from a deposit account.\u201d Under subsection (d), the Commissioner is authorized to charge a fee covering the cost of processing applications by these restricted organizations to engage in \u201cbanking business\u201d and has established such fee to be $1,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-5\">The facts of this controversy are undisputed as the case was presented to the district judge upon cross-motions for summary judgment with a joint statement of facts. Sears is a New York corporation with its headquarters in Chicago. Appellant AEI is a wholly owned subsidiary of Sears and itself wholly owns the Sears Savings Bank (formerly known as the Allstate Savings and Loan Association), a California chartered stock thrift institution organized and existing under the laws of California and having all of its offices in California. Therefore, Sears qualifies as a \u201cholding company\u201d under the Act because of its controlling interest in the Sears Savings Bank as a wholly owned second-tier subsidiary.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b502-7\">On August 2, 1984, the Commissioner notified Sears of the Act\u2019s requirements and requested that Sears provide sufficient information for his determination as to whether two Sears Financial Network centers (\u201cSFN centers\u201d) fell within subsections (b) or (d) of the statute. SFN centers generally combine the activities of agents of Allstate and representatives of Dean Witter and Coldwell Banker in order to offer their respective products and services in a central location, typically within a Sears retail outlet. The products offered at SFN centers include the various lines of property, liability, life and health insurance and other products marketed by Allstate and Allstate Life; the dissemination and acceptance of loan applications for AEI; residential real estate -brokerage services available through Coldwell Banker; and securities brokerage, principal trading, domestic and foreign investment banking, and related services through Dean Witter. Sears contemplated the establishment of two SFN centers, one in West Hartford and another in Waterford, Connecticut, apparently without knowledge of the application requirement or the prohibitions contained in the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-8\">After filing this suit for declaratory judgment in the United States District Court for the District of Connecticut to challenge the constitutionality of the Act, but prior to judgment, Sears applied under subsection (b) to the Commissioner on October 11, 1984 to authorize the two SFN centers and a Sears retail store as offices of a \u201cholding company\u201d which are not to be engaged in banking business. Approval as to the retail store was granted by the Com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>missioner on November 14, 1984, but, on December 28, 1984, the Commissioner determined that the SFN centers would be involved in banking business and that certain activities of the SFN centers would constitute deposit services. More specifically, the Commissioner found that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b503-5\">Within the broad array of financial services provided at a Financial Network are numerous activities which fall within the definition of banking business in section 36-5a(b) of the General Statutes. Such activities include, but are not limited to, the processing of loan applications for Allstate Enterprises, Inc., which loans money for the purchase of automobiles, boats and recreational vehicles and makes second mortgage loans to Connecticut residents, and the making of first mortgage loans on property located in Connecticut through Coldwell Banker Residential Group.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b503-6\">JA-41.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-7\">The Commissioner also found that two of Dean Witter\u2019s services constituted \u201cdeposit services\u201d that are prohibited by subsection (d) of the Act: (1) the brokering of certificates of deposit for various financial institutions, and (2) the \u201cSweep Account\u201d feature of the Active Assets Account (\u201cAAA\u201d) program offered by Dean Witter. The brokering services that the Commissioner characterized as deposit services involved Dean Witter\u2019s brokering of certificates of deposit offered by various financial institutions, including Sears Savings Bank, and the brokering of Sears Money Market Savings Accounts offered by Sears Savings Bank. The AAA program offered by Dean Witter provided a group of integrated financial services that included a margin account capability that would allow an owner of an AAA account to buy and sell securities on a cash basis or on credit. More importantly for purposes of the statute, an owner of an AAA account might also elect to have the funds in his account that were not used for a specific investment purpose automatically invested in one of Sears Savings Bank\u2019s \u201cSuper NOW\u201d accounts. Dean Witter also acts as agent for an owner who wishes to use the funds deposited in this \u201cSweep Account.\u201d The Commissioner conditioned approval of the SFN centers upon the discontinuation of both these activities. Hence, the Commissioner indicated that he would grant approval pursuant to subsection (d) for the application apropos the two SFN centers conditioned upon two requirements, (1) that Sears not engage in deposit services at the SFN centers and (2) that Sears submit a $1,000 fee for the processing of each application under subsection (d).</p>\n<p id=\"b503-9\">Subsequently, Sears filed numerous applications seeking the Commissioner\u2019s approval of various offices of Sears subsidiary companies. On January 9, 1985, Sears filed applications pursuant to subsection (b) for, <em>inter alia, </em>two offices of Allstate Enterprises Mortgage Corporation (\u201cAEMC\u201d) for the purpose of making first mortgage loans on commercial and residential property in Connecticut. The Commissioner rejected these applications by letter dated January 17, 1985, finding that the offices of AEMC would be engaged in banking business and directing that the applications be filed pursuant to subsection (d). No such applications have been filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-10\">As a result of these and other applications by Sears or its subsidiaries between September of 1984 and March of 1985, the Commissioner has unconditionally approved 91 of 95 applications by Sears and its subsidiaries. Through these determinations, the Commissioner has found that general merchandise retail operations, catalog operations, credit-sale operations, and service to retail and catalog customers at Sears retail stores would not enable Sears or any of its subsidiaries to engage in banking business in Connecticut. The Commissioner also determined that residential and commercial real estate brokerage and related services provided primarily by Coldwell Banker did not constitute banking business as long as these activities did not include mortgage banking, mortgage lending, or acceptance of loan applications. In addition, the Commissioner determined that the activities of Sears\u2019 various insurance subsidiaries did not enable Sears or any subsidiary of Sears <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>to engage in banking business. Finally, the Commissioner determined that certain new lending activities proposed at existing offices of AEI did not constitute new \u201cbanking activity,\u201d which would require approval under subsection (b) of the Act, but rather would be authorized under the grandfather provision of subsection (c)(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b504-4\">As to the four applications that the Commissioner did not unconditionally approve, two for SFN centers and two for AEMC offices, the Commissioner indicated that these activities could be authorized under subsection (d) with the exception of deposit services. The only activities so characterized by the Commissioner, and thereby forbidden altogether, were certain Dean Witter brokering activities and the sweep account aspect of Dean Witter\u2019s AAA program.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-5\">In their suit in the district court, appellants challenged the constitutionality of the Act on both Commerce Clause and Supremacy Clause grounds. The district judge addressed the appellants' contentions first by establishing the appropriate construction of the grandfather clause, contained in subsection (c)(4), and the provisions of subsection (d) of the Act which allow holding companies to open two new offices per year which engage in banking business so long as deposit services are not provided. Notwithstanding appellants\u2019 contention to the contrary, the district judge found these provisions to be equally applicable to Connecticut as well as non-Connecticut holding companies based upon the language of the Act and the interpretation given the Act by the Commissioner. Having so construed subsections (c)(4) and (d), the district court therefore focused upon whether the exception in subsection (c)(3) violates the Commerce Clause in that it allows subsidiaries of Connecticut banks and S &amp; L\u2019s to open offices engaged in banking business to a greater extent than its out-of-state counterparts.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-6\">Citing <em>Exxon Corp. v. Maryland, </em>437 U.S. 117, 98 S.Ct. 2207, 57 L.Ed.2d 91 (1978), the district court reasoned that discrimination between different entities based upon the non-geographic characteristics of those entities does not implicate the concerns of the Commerce Clause. Further, the district court held that the geographic discrimination against non-Connecticut banks and S &amp; L\u2019s vis-a-vis Connecticut banks and S &amp; L\u2019s had been authorized by Congress, citing <em>Northeast Bancorp, Inc. v. Board of Governors, </em>472 U.S. 159, 105 S.Ct. 2545, 86 L.Ed.2d 112 (1985). Based upon this analysis and the finding that there was no intent to discriminate against non-Connecticut holding companies and their subsidiaries, the district court rejected appellant\u2019s arguments that the Act discriminated against or burdened interstate commerce.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-8\">The district judge also rejected appellants\u2019 claim, under <em>United States Brewers Association v. Healy, </em>692 F.2d 275 (2d Cir.1982), <em>aff\u2019d mem., </em>464 U.S. 909, 104 S.Ct. 265, 78 L.Ed.2d 248 (1983), that the Act had an extraterritorial effect. The district court ruled that the Act \u201cseeks to regulate even-handedly the conduct of banking business in Connecticut by certain entities rather than to set the prices of transactions in other states,\u201d and that any disincentive to ownership of non-Connecticut banks or savings and loans \u201cdoes not contravene the Commerce Clause because such a disincentive is based on permissible regulation of a certain form of business unit.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b504-9\">Also, the district court ruled that Connecticut\u2019s interest in the stable growth of its financial sector in a rapidly changing market environment was substantial and that the even-handed, reasonable and moderate impact of the Act satisfied any concern that there was an excessive burden upon commerce. Thus the Act met the requirements of the balancing test under <em>Pike v. Bruce Church, Inc., </em>397 U.S. 137, 90 S.Ct. 844, 25 L.Ed.2d 174 (1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b504-10\">As to the Supremacy Clause claims, the district court rejected appellants\u2019 argument that the comprehensive nature of the federal Savings and Loan Holding Company Act, 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1730a(a)-(n) (1982) (\u201cSLHCA\u201d) implicitly preempted the field of savings <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>and loan holding company regulation holding that: (1) the legislative history reflected a Congressional awareness that certain states\u2019 regulation of such companies existed since among other things, the SLHCA contained a provision requiring state and federal regulators of such companies to share information; and (2) nothing in the SLHCA or its legislative history expressed sufficient Congressional intent to preempt all state regulation of such holding companies. Regarding appellants\u2019 argument that the Act directly conflicts with one of the purposes of the SLHCA, to protect the marketability of unitary savings and loan holding companies, the district court found that the effect of the Connecticut Act in regulating the number of banking business offices that may be opened in Connecticut presented no obstacle to the purposes of the federal statute since the Act would \u201chave at most a modest impact on [the] marketability\u201d of a thrift institution. In addition, the district court noted that Congress showed no intent that \u201cthe various banking business subsidiaries of large, far-flung unitary holding companies would be exempt from any limitations imposed by the states.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b505-5\">For these reasons, the district court granted summary judgment in favor of defendants and denied plaintiffs\u2019 cross-motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b505-7\">1. The Commerce Clause Claims</p>\n<p id=\"b505-8\">The Commerce Clause of the Constitution grants Congress the power \u201c[t]o regulate Commerce ... among the several States.\u201d Art. I, \u00a7 8, cl. 3. Though this language explicitly grants power to Congress, it has long been recognized that this grant of power implicitly limits the authority of the states in the area of interstate commerce. <em>Lewis v. BT Investment Managers, Inc., </em>447 U.S. 27, 35, 100 S.Ct. 2009, 2014, 64 L.Ed.2d 702 (1980) (citations omitted). In determining whether a state regulation interferes with the explicit power granted to Congress, the Supreme Court has \u201cadopted what amounts to a two-tiered approach to analyzing state economic regulation under the Commerce Clause.\u201d <em>Brown-Forman Distillers Corp. v. New York State Liquor Authority, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 106 S.Ct. 2080, 2084, 90 L.Ed.2d 552 (1986). Where the statute directly regulates or discriminates against interstate commerce, or its effect is to favor intrastate economic interests over out-of-state interests, the Court has applied a virtual <em>per se </em>rule of invalidity. <em>Edgar v. MITE Corp., </em>457 U.S. 624, 640-43, 102 S.Ct. 2629, 2639-41, 73 L.Ed.2d 269 (1982); <em>Philadelphia v. New Jersey, </em>437 U.S. 617, 624, 98 S.Ct. 2531, 2535, 57 L.Ed.2d 475 (1978); <em>Shafer v. Farmers Grain Co., </em>268 U.S. 189, 201, 45 S.Ct. 481, 486, 69 L.Ed. 909 (1925). However, where the state regulation is not intentionally protectionist, regulates even-handedly, and has only an incidental impact upon interstate commerce, the Court inquires as to whether there is a legitimate local interest in the regulation and whether the burden on interstate commerce clearly exceeds the local benefits. <em>Pike v. Bruce Church, Inc., </em>397 U.S. 137, 142, 90 S.Ct. 844, 847, 25 L.Ed.2d 174 (1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b505-12\">Appellants argue on appeal that the Act in question was intentionally enacted as protectionist legislation, has a disparate effect upon out-of-state holding companies, and unduly burdens interstate commerce. If appellants successfully establish that the purpose <em>or </em>effect of the Connecticut Act was to protect Connecticut financial institutions from out-of-state competition, then the Act would presumably be rendered <em>per se </em>invalid under <em>Bacchus Imports, Ltd. v. Dias, </em>468 U.S. 263, 270, 104 S.Ct. 3049, 3055, 82 L.Ed.2d 200 (1984). However, under the two-tiered approach outlined above, should appellants merely establish an incidental burden upon commerce then we must weigh that burden against the legitimate local concern involved. Only if that burden is excessive in relation to the local interest would the Act be found violative of the Commerce Clause. <em>Pike, </em>397 U.S. at 142, 90 S.Ct. at 847.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>Appellants base their claim of discriminatory purpose on three sources: statements made by Connecticut Assistant Attorney General Haines during oral argument of the cross-motions below, a report of a state commission appointed by the legislature to study the financial services market and to make recommendations for legislation, and a statement by State Representative Ono-rato on the floor of the Connecticut House of Representatives. None of these statements is particularly persuasive regarding the intent of the Connecticut legislature in passing the Act, and there was no actual debate of the proposed legislation.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-4\">The statement made by the assistant attorney general at oral argument during the proceedings below could hardly be considered evidence of legislative intent since it was <em>post hoc </em>and, therefore, not part of the legislative history. Furthermore, the import of his statement was that the purpose supporting the Act was to preclude non-regulated entities \u201cfrom projecting their basic banking functions which they cannot do directly\u201d into the market for banking services in Connecticut via indirect holding company arrangements.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-9\">The state or Hebb Commission\u2019s report is a part of the legislative history and, therefore, somewhat indicative of the purpose of the legislature. Appellants misconstrue the sentiment expressed in the fourteen page report by reading two phrases out of context.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The portions of the report quot<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>ed in the footnote were contained in the Commission\u2019s findings of fact and recommendations. Rather than implicating an intent to discriminate against interstate commerce as appellants suggest, these statements are reflective of the information gleaned by the Commission and presented to the legislature as to the condition of the market for financial services.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-5\">In addition to reading the Commission\u2019s report in its entirety, the statutory charge to the Commission provides evidence of the context of the report. The Connecticut Legislature stated at section 36-5b(a) that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AB0\">There is established a commission to inquire into, study and report on the desirability of the state of Connecticut enacting legislation to limit the extent to which a bank holding company, <em>whether organized under the laws of this state or any other state, may maintain an office or conduct any business in this state through a subsidiary of such holding company. </em>Among the principal factors to be considered in determining the appropriateness of such legislation shall be whether it can reasonably be expected to produce benefits to the public such as greater convenience, increased competition or gains in efficiency which outweigh possible adverse effects such as undue concentration of resources, decreased or unfair competition, conflicts of interest or unsound banking practices. In addition, the commission shall consider such other factors as are pertinent to such inquiry including, but not limited to, federal banking legislation, policies with respect to the interstate conduct of banking business and interstate banking\u2019s relationship with and impact on intrastate banking. With respect to that relationship, the commission may examine and make recommendations concerning state banking laws and regulations, including home office protection, mergers and consolidations between financial institutions and <em>the type of services which state financial institutions may offer, and activities of nondepository institutions and their impact on traditional banking activities.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b507-8\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b507-9\">Finally, notwithstanding the recommendation by the Commission of the legislation at issue herein, its primary purpose and primary recommendation was to allow regional interstate banking. <em>See </em>Hebb Commission report, <em>supra </em>note 5, at 13. This recommendation became law at section 36-552 of the Connecticut General Statutes. Since the state had been delegated authority to close its borders to out-of-state banking under the Douglas Amendment to the Bank Holding Company Act, 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1841 <em>et seq., </em>its decision to open them partially was not only within its authority but also was not an action suggesting a protectionist purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-10\">When viewed in light of the broad context of the full report, the statutory charge to the Commission, and the ultimate legislative recommendations which were made by the Commission, it becomes clear that \u00e1 protectionist intent cannot be ascribed to the Commission or the legislature. In our view, the allegedly protectionist statements made by the Commission in its fourteen page report merely evidence an attempt to give informed recommendations to the legislature as to how the state could effective<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>ly deal with the regulation of banking in Connecticut during a volatile period of nationwide transition in the banking industry.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-4\">We are unpersuaded that the statements made by State Representative Onorato evidenced a protectionist purpose by the legislature in enacting the Act. Regarding several amendments previously passed by the State Senate addressing interstate banking, Representative Onorato stated to the House of Representatives that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b508-5\">Section 2 [of Senate Amendment \u201cA\u201d] extends the prohibition on the establishment of offices by out-of-state bank holding companies and its [sic] subsidiaries to non-bank subsidiaries, and affiliates of non-Connecticut thrift institutions, and it amends further a clarifying section that the offices of the Connecticut savings banks and savings and loan associations and their subsidiaries are excepted from the prohibitions on the establishment of these offices in Connecticut.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b508-6\">... Senate Amendment \u201cA\u201d, prohibits the ownership of non-bank banks located in Connecticut by bank holding companies. This rule would apply to all bank holding companies____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b508-8\"><em>Connecticut House of Representatives Reports, </em>May 7, 1984, at 409-10.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-9\">These statements, as an introduction of amending legislation before a legislative body, do not appear to reflect the intent of the legislature as much as they reflect the speaker\u2019s understanding of the amendment\u2019s effect. The Representative\u2019s initial statement in the above quoted text that the prohibition was directed at out-of-state bank holding companies misapprehends the effect of the legislation. However, the Representative\u2019s subsequent expression in the final quoted paragraph stating that the \u201crule would apply to all bank holding companies\u201d reflects the same interpretation adopted by the Commissioner in applying the Act. At best, Representative Onorato\u2019s statements are unclear as to whether they express intent or effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-10\">In sum, appellants\u2019 assertion that these three statements provide evidence of a protectionist purpose must fail. Of the three statements raised by appellants, one is not part of the legislative history, another has been quoted largely out of context, and the third, while a part of the legislative history, is not helpful in gleaning the intent of the legislature since the language is unclear. Based upon such \u201cevidence\u201d we find the appellants\u2019 conclusion that there was an <em>intent </em>to discriminate against interstate commerce to be strained. We next move to the question of whether the Act has the <em>effect </em>of discriminating against interstate commerce.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-12\">We agree with the district court\u2019s construction of the Act and we find no effective discrimination between like entities based upon geographic criteria. <em>Compare BT Investment, </em>447 U.S. at 40-42, 100 S.Ct. at 2017-18, <em>with Exxon, </em>437 U.S. at 126-27, 98 S.Ct. at 2214. The Act regulates all holding companies without regard to geography and, thus, does not discriminate on the basis of geography. The Act does, however, distinguish between Connecticut banks and S &amp; L\u2019s on the one hand and non-Connecticut banks and S &amp; L\u2019s on the other. But, this distinction is not at-issue here; further, appellants concede that under the McFadden Act and the Federal Bank Holding Company Act, the states have clearly been granted authority by Congress to exclude all out-of-state banks, <em>see Northeast Bancorp, Inc., </em>472 U.S. at 170, 105 S.Ct. at 2552. Appellants also concede that federal statutes and regulations grant Connecticut the authority to exclude out-of-state branches of federally chartered S &amp; L\u2019s (12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1464(r) (1982) and 12 C.F.R. \u00a7 556.5(a) (1986)) and acquisitions by multiple S &amp; L holding companies of federally insured thrifts operating in more than one state (12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1730a(e)(3) (1982)).</p>\n<p id=\"b508-14\">As to appellants\u2019 contention that the state has no authority to close its borders to an out-of-state, state chartered S &amp; L, such as the Sears Savings Bank, we state no opinion since this issue is not presented by this case. Here, Sears Savings Bank itself is not attempting to enter the state in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>any way. Rather, subsidiaries of Sears seek to engage in banking business within the State of Connecticut. Appellants\u2019 claim that the Connecticut Act violates the Commerce Clause because it regulates the activities of interstate holding companies must fail. As the Court stated in <em>Exxon, </em>\u201c[w]e cannot ... accept appellants\u2019 underlying notion that the Commerce Clause protects the particular structure or methods of operation in a ... market,\u201d 437 U.S. at 127, 98 S.Ct. at 2214. \u201c[T]he Clause protects the interstate market, not particular interstate firms.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In <em>Exxon, </em>the Court found a Maryland statute which precluded companies that refined or produced oil from owning retail gas stations in the state to be constitutional in the face of a Commerce Clause challenge. There, the regulation had been enacted at the height of the gasoline crisis which gripped this country during the late 1970\u2019s. Also in that case, there were no refineries or oil production facilities in the State of Maryland nor did any Maryland based company own or operate a refinery or oil production facility in another state. The court held that the statute did not implicate the concerns of the Commerce Clause since it did not make distinctions based upon geographic criteria and since the Commerce Clause was not intended to protect \u201cparticular structures\u201d of operation.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-5\">This case is strikingly similar since the Act herein was passed in response to a perceived crisis in the banking industry, the onslaught of non-bank banks and the increasingly likely prospect of interstate banking. However, any discriminatory effect on out-of-state holding companies is unlikely here since it is clear that Connecticut holding companies do exist and are equally affected by the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-6\">Finally, applying the <em>Pike </em>balancing test, we find a substantial legitimate local concern in the regulation of banking services within the state. Appellants themselves have implicitly recognized this strong local concern by conceding the states\u2019 authority to exclude out-of-state banks from their borders. Moreover, the regulation is tailored and moderate in its effect. It affects only holding companies, allows existing offices of such companies to go unaffected, allows two new non-depository banking offices per year and precludes only deposit services. We conclude that any burden upon interstate commerce cannot be characterized as excessive in relation to the local concern found herein.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-8\">2. The Supremacy Clause Claim</p>\n<p id=\"b509-9\">Under the Supremacy Clause, a federal law preempts a state law whenever Congress expressly so provides or when preemption must be inferred to ensure fulfillment of the objectives of a federal statute. This inference may be drawn when \u201c[t]he scheme of federal regulation [is] so pervasive as to make reasonable the inference that Congress left no room for the States to supplement it,\u201d <em>Rice v. Santa Fe Elevator Corp., </em>331 U.S. 218, 230, 67 S.Ct. 1146, 1152, 91 L.Ed. 1447 (1947); when \u201c \u2018compliance with both federal and state regulations is a physical impossibility,\u2019\u201d <em>Fidelity Federal Savings &amp; Loan Association v. de la Cuesta, </em>458 U.S. 141, 152-53, 102 S.Ct. 3014, 3022, 73 L.Ed.2d 664 (1982) (quoting <em>Florida Lime &amp; Avocado Growers, Inc. v. Paul, </em>373 U.S. 132, 142-43, 83 S.Ct. 1210, 1217, 10 L.Ed.2d 248 (1963)); or \u201cwhen state law \u2018stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of Congress,\u2019 \u201d <em>Fidelity Federal, supra </em>(quoting <em>Hines v. Davidowitz, </em>312 U.S. 52, 67, 61 S.Ct. 399, 404, 85 L.Ed. 581 (1941)). <em>See also Grocery Manufacturers of America, Inc. v. Gerace, </em>755 F.2d 993, 999 (2d Cir.), <em>aff\u2019d mem., </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 106 S.Ct. 36, 88 L.Ed.2d 29 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b509-12\">Appellants argue that the Act prevents the accomplishment of the full purposes and objectives of Congress in enacting the 1967 amendments to the SLHCA. Prior to 1967, the SLHCA did not regulate S &amp; L holding companies or the non-thrift subsidiaries of such holding companies. However, in 1967 Congress added provisions that limited S &amp; L holding companies and their subsidiaries to activities related to the savings and loan business. Savings and Loan <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>Holding Company Amendments of 1967, Pub.L. No. 255, \u00a7 2, 82 Stat. 5, 8 (1968) (codified at 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1730a(c)(2) (1982)). In enacting this regulation, Congress left unitary holding companies, those that owned only one thrift institution, unrestricted. <em>Id. </em>Appellants point out that Congress left unitary holding companies unrestricted because it feared that restrictions would \u201cseriously impair the marketability of existing capital stock associations.\u201d S.Rep. No. 354, 90th Cong., 1st Sess. 6 (1967). Appellants argue that the Connecticut Act thwarts this Congressional objective by discouraging holding companies from purchasing existing thrift institutions. For example, appellants posit that a corporation whose subsidiaries engage in \u201cdeposit services\u201d in Connecticut would be unable to purchase a non-Connecticut thrift unless it were willing to give up the opportunity of opening new Connecticut offices offering \u201cdeposit services.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b510-4\">We do not doubt that the Connecticut Act will have some impact on the marketability of thrifts. However, we do not find protection of the marketability of thrifts to be one of the objectives of Congress in enacting the amendments to the SLHCA. As mentioned above, Congress did not wish the SLHCA to impair the marketability of existing thrifts. We find this to be evidence that Congress did not want the SLHCA to deter companies from buying thrifts. In other words, Congress wished to avoid doing harm, but showed no intent to protect affirmatively S &amp; L marketability. We cannot conclude that Congress impliedly preempted any state regulation that might reduce the marketability of thrift institutions. Thus, the potential impairment of the marketability of S &amp; L\u2019s does not invalidate the challenged provisions of the Connecticut Act on Supremacy Clause grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-5\">The main purpose behind the SLHCA expressed at the time of its enactment was to protect S &amp; L\u2019s from becoming \u201centangled in a corporate web designed to promote\u201d interests unrelated to the purposes for which S &amp; L\u2019s were created \u2014 encouraging thrift and promoting home ownership. S.Rep. No. 810, 86th Cong., 1st Sess., <em>reprinted in </em>1959 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad. News 2883, 2887. Another important goal was to preserve the thrifts\u2019 emphasis on local ownership, local management and local investment. <em>Id. </em>The 1967 amendments were intended primarily to further promote the \u201cgoals of encouraging thrift and providing a main source of residential financing.\u201d H.R.Rep. No. 997, 90th Cong., 2d Sess., <em>reprinted in </em>1968 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News 1601, 1603. Appellants posit, and we perceive, no conflict between these objectives and the challenged provisions of the Connecticut Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-7\">Appellants urge that if Congress had wanted to allow the states to regulate the activities of holding companies and their subsidiaries it could have included in the SLHCA a provision analogous to section 7 of the Bank Holding Company Act, 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1846 (1982), which expressly empowers states to regulate bank holding companies and their subsidiaries. It is argued that since the SLHCA does not expressly allow regulation of S &amp; L holding companies by states, the Connecticut Act conflicts with the Congressional decision to forgo regulation. Appellants cite <em>Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line Corp. v. State Oil &amp; Gas Board, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 106 S.Ct. 709, 88 L.Ed.2d 732 (1986), for this proposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-10\">We note, however, that in the circumstances of this case, Congress\u2019s silence as to whether states may regulate holding companies can just as easily be interpreted as implicit approval of state regulation. This interpretation seems a proper one to make given the fact that Congress indicated that it was aware at the time of the SLHCA\u2019s passage that states already regulated savings and loan holding companies and their subsidiaries. <em>See </em>12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1730a(b)(4) (1982) (concerning sharing of reports filed with, and examinations made by, state supervisory authorities).</p>\n<p id=\"b510-11\">Furthermore, the <em>Transcontinental </em>case is inapposite. In that case, the Supreme Court stated that \u201c \u2018a federal decision to forgo regulation in a given area may imply an authoritative federal determination that the area is best left <em>un </em>regulated, and in that event would have as much preemptive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>force as a decision <em>to </em>regulate.\u2019 \u201d <em>Transcontinental, </em>106 S.Ct. at 717 (quoting <em>Arkansas Electric Cooperative Corp. v. Arkansas Public Service Commission, </em>461 U.S. 375, 384, 103 S.Ct. 1905, 1912, 76 L.Ed.2d 1 (1983) (emphasis in original)). In that case, however, Congress had eliminated the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission\u2019s power to regulate particular aspects of the \u201cfirst sale\u201d of natural gas because it wanted the price and supply to be determined as much as possible by market forces. <em>Id. </em>at 716-17. By doing so, it impliedly preempted any state attempts to regulate the same aspects of the first sale of natural gas. <em>Id. </em>at 717. In our view, under the SLHCA, Congress\u2019s purpose in not restricting the activities of unitary holding companies was to ensure that the SLHCA did nothing to impair the marketability of S &amp; L\u2019s rather than to ensure that S &amp; L\u2019s remained marketable.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-4\">We therefore hold that the Supremacy Clause does not invalidate the challenged provisions of the Connecticut Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-5\">We have considered the appellants\u2019 other arguments and find them unpersuasive. The judgment of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b500-9\">. The Act states in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b500-10\">Sec. 36-5a.

The sections extracted from the report by the appellants state:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b506-6\">Upon the creation of our Commission, the issue with which the members struggled (and with which the Commission was charged under our Public Act) involved the advisability of a non-Connecticut banking organization being allowed to establish a banking operation in Connecticut or branching its own activities into Connecticut. As the members addressed the multi-faceted issues of interstate banking, we found ourselves, of necessity, having to review the effect and interplay of those Connecticut regulatory provisions governing intrastate banking organizations. The questions of mergers between commercial banks and thrift institutions, the EFT system, and the effect of the Home Office Protection laws bore so heavily on our analysis that they simply could not be ignored. Indeed, irrespective of the future direction of interstate banking, all seem to agree that there is a need for a review of Connecticut regulation so as to be sure that our own banks may be progressively more able to provide healthy competition within Connecticut as well as competition to the multi-national banking corporations.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b506-7\">It also became very obvious to the Commission that the greatest amount of activity in the financial services industry came in recent years not from the banks, either foreign or domestic. It came through the emergence of far-flung networks of outlets that organizations such as Sears, Merrill Lynch, Shearson, American Express and many others created to compete on a local level with services which banks have traditionally provided. These institutions are free of Federal Reserve requirements, branching restrictions, many interest rate ceilings and bank holding company restrictions and are now effectively competing with the entire banking industry across the country. It did not take long for the Commission to conclude when analyzing the competitive impact of such institutions that the most unsophisticated consumer can quickly recognize that a money market fund yields a higher return than a bank account with a low interest rate ceiling while providing similar security. The average consumer is becoming increasingly aware. These non-banking institutions are able to use telephones, television and inordinately broad credit facilities to solicit and further develop their many businesses. Dramatically, the center of gravity of the financial services industry has shifted.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A9pR\">Interstate banking cannot effectively be examined without analyzing its relationship and impact on intrastate banking. This necessitates a review of the entire system of intrastate banking laws and regulations and an assessment of the potential impact on Connecticut consumers of any changes in the intrastate and interstate regulations of the banking industry. It is equally apparent, that neither interstate banking nor intrastate banking may be addressed without a review and study of the non-depository institutions and the impact of their activities on traditional banking. Thus, the Commission applied for and received additional authority from the Connecticut General Assembly which allowed it to study and consider the three areas of concern: intrastate banking, interstate banking and the effect of multi-faceted non-deposit institutions on banking as a whole.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"arm-dedup-0\">Both at the national and state levels the philosophy underlying our structure of bank regulation has been to promote a pluralistic banking system \u2014 a system comprised of many units, rather than a highly concentrated system made up of a few large banks. The promotion of local ownership and control of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>banks has as one of its objectives the preservation of a close relationship between those in our communities who need credit and those who provide credit. To allow the control of credit that is essential for the health of our state economy to pass to hands that are not immediately responsive to the interests of Connecticut citizens and businesses would not, we believe, serve our state well. Similarly, to expose our smaller banks to the rigors of unlimited competition from large out-of-state banking organizations \u2014 particularly at a time when deregulation of banking products at the federal level is already putting strains on the resources of smaller banks \u2014 would not be wise.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"azi-dedup-1\">Report to the General Assembly of the State of Connecticut of the Findings and Recommendations of the Commission to Study Legislation to Limit the Conduct of Business in Connecticut by Subsidiaries of Bank Holding Companies and the Impact of Non-Depository Institutions on Traditional Banking Activities, 5-7, 10-11 (January 5, 1983).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
