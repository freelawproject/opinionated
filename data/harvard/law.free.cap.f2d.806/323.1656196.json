Camile appeals from a summary judgment entered in Kraft\u2019s favor. The basis for the summary judgment was that Camile failed to point to any provision in any contract that prevented Kraft from unilaterally terminating the relationship. Camile now argues that there were several such provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-21\">Camile first says that Kraft breached an oral contract. It claims that a representative of Kraft once told its president, Ron Cmiel, that \u201c[w]e want you to retire in the business and we want your children to retire in the business.\u201d But, even assuming, as we must, that Kraft made this statement, the words would at best create a contract of \u201cindefinite term;\u201d and, it is well established under Indiana law that such a contract is terminable at will. <em>Marksill Specialties v. Barger, </em>428 N.E.2d 65, 69 (Ind.App.1981); <em>House of Crane v. H. Fendrich, Inc., </em>146 Ind.App. 478, 256 N.E.2d 578, 579-80 (1970); <em>Bell v. Speed Queen, </em>407 F.2d 1022, 1024-25 (7th Cir.1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b424-22\">Camile next points to a provision in a later written contract forbidding Kraft from soliciting customers in Camile\u2019s territory \u201cso long as Camile Foods, Inc. remains <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>a Sealtest [Kraft] distributor.\u201d On its face, however, this provision does not forbid Kraft from terminating Camile; it simply forbids Kraft from soliciting customers unless it <em>does </em>terminate Camile (which it did). Camile would like to prove, through extrinsic evidence, that the contract really means that Kraft cannot solicit customers \u201cso long as Camile <em>wants to remain </em>a Kraft distributor.\u201d But (even assuming that this interpretation could somehow overcome the problem of \u201cindefinite duration\u201d) this is not what the contract says. We can find no ambiguity in its written terms; and we do not believe that \u201creasonable people could find its terms susceptible\u201d to the interpretation Camile suggests. <em>Ethyl Corp. v. Forcum-Lannom Associates, </em>433 N.E.2d 1214, 1217-18 (Ind.App.1982); <em>see also First Savings and </em>Loan, <em>Association v. Treaster, </em>490 N.E.2d 1149, 1151-52 (Ind.App.1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b425-4\">Camile argues that the doctrine of \u201cmerger\u201d permits it to use Kraft\u2019s alleged prior <em>oral </em>statement (about retiring in the business) to create an ambiguity that would then allow Camile to introduce the same statement to resolve the ambiguity in Camile\u2019s favor. The merger doctrine, however, does not work in that way. Rather, the \u201cmerger\u201d doctrine holds that where the subject matter of one contract is subsequently entirely subsumed in another, the latter becomes \u201cthe exclusive medium of ascertaining the contract by which the parties bound themselves.\u201d <em>McCaskey Register Co. v. Curfman, </em>45 Ind.App. 297, 90 N.E. 323, 326 (1910); <em>see also Swanson-Nunn Realty Co. v. Gentry, </em>134 Ind.App. 580, 186 N.E.2d 574, 580 (1962) (\u201c[P]arol testimony can not be received to ... provide the foundation for recovery upon an alleged oral understanding later reduced to writing.\u201d). The earlier contract disappears. It does not remain to exert some wraith-like influence on what otherwise would be clear, unambiguous meaning.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-5\">Camile\u2019s best argument is its claim that Kraft, in terminating Camile\u2019s distributorship, violated an implied promise to act in \u201cgood faith.\u201d An intermediate Indiana appeals court has read such a covenant into a contract allowing a manufacturer to terminate a dealer for cause, <em>Montgomery Ward &amp; Co. v. Tackett, </em>163 Ind.App. 211, 323 N.E.2d 242, 245-47 (1975), and the implications of that holding have been the subject of legal speculation, <em>see Survey of Recent Developments in Indiana Law, </em>9 Ind.L.Rev. 1, 156-58 (1975). The Seventh Circuit, a court familiar with Indiana law, has, however, held that, notwithstanding <em>Tackett, </em>Indiana law allows unilateral termination of contracts of \u201cindefinite duration\u201d without cause or even in bad faith. <em>Rockwell Engineering Co. v. Automatic Timing &amp; Controls Co., </em>559 F.2d 460, 463 (7th Cir.1977). Camile says the Seventh Circuit is wrong. But, we are reasonably confident that it is right, at least insofar as the facts of <em>this </em>case are concerned. The only \u201cbad faith\u201d that Camile now might prove in respect to Kraft\u2019s termination basically amounts to Kraft\u2019s having had no good reasons (only unspecified bad ones) for ridding itself of Camile. To accept a mere lack of good reasons as potentially creating a violation of a contract of \u201cindefinite duration\u201d would, however, transform such a contract from one terminable \u201cat will\u201d into one terminable \u201cfor cause.\u201d Neither the facts of <em>Tackett </em>(which involved a contract terminable only under specified conditions), nor the \u201cbad faith\u201d there proved (a host of specific acts, directly relevant to the ground for termination), nor the <em>Tackett </em>court\u2019s language suggests that it intended any such result. We therefore cannot accept the argument that <em>Tackett </em>effected a fundamental change in Indiana law relevant here.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-8\">\n<em>The motion to certify questions of law to the Supreme Court of Indiana is denied.
