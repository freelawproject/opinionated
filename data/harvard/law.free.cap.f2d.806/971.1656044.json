BROWN, Senior District Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b1055-27\">Count I of the indictment in this criminal action charged that from September, 1982, to December 6, 1984, at Oklahoma City, Chicago, Corpus Christi and other locations, the defendant-appellant, Donald Er-vin Smith, and his co-defendants Ernest Burton, a/k/a Tom Burton, and William A. Vandiver, of Chicago, Illinois, conspired together, and with Paul Duane Cawthon, George Wesley Cawthon, Robert Dean Phillips, John Randall Lecas, and others, to distribute Dilaudid, a Schedule II narcotic substance, in violation of 21 U.S.C. Sec. 846. Smith was also charged with three counts of interstate travel to promote the distribution of Dilaudid, in violation of 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1952 (Counts 3, 7 and 11, travel on November 2, November 10, and Novem<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"972\">*972</page-number>ber 29, 1983), and with three counts of distribution of Dilaudid in violation of 21 U.S.C. Sec. 841(a)(1) (Counts 5, 9, and 13, sales on November 2, November 10, and November 29,1983). Smith was tried separately from his co-defendants, and was found guilty on all seven counts.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> This appeal follows.</p>\n<p id=\"b1056-4\">Smith contends that the evidence submitted by the government was at \u201cfatal variance\u201d with the specific dates alleged in the indictment, and therefore the evidence was insufficient to sustain his convictions. He also contends that sufficient independent evidence of the existence of the conspiracy did not exist, and therefore his conviction on the conspiracy count cannot stand.</p>\n<p id=\"b1056-5\">The government\u2019s evidence consisted of the testimony of the co-conspirators, Paul Duane Cawthon, Robert Dean Phillips, and John Randall Lecas, and other witnesses who supplied corroborating evidence. Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, it was established that a conspiracy existed among those named in the indictment, whereby Robert Phillips and appellant Smith, who operated bars in Houston and Corpus Christi, purchased wholesale quantities of Dilaudid from their Chicago suppliers, Van-diver and Burton, taking delivery in Oklahoma City, Arkansas, or Chicago. Phillips and Smith then sold the tablets to the Caw-thon brothers in Oklahoma City, and they, in turn, resold to their street dealers.</p>\n<p id=\"b1056-6\">Tim Brown, an Oklahoma City police officer testified that he arrested Paul and George Cawthon on a city street in April, 1984, and a search of their car produced a large quantity of Dilaudid tablets, and thousands of dollars. On June 22, 1984, Officer Brown participated in another arrest of Paul and George Cawthon at their apartment, at which time a large quantity of Dilaudid and another large sum of money were seized. Both Cawthon brothers were charged with possession of Dilaudid with intent to distribute.</p>\n<p id=\"b1056-9\">Paul Cawthon testified that he used drugs in Vietnam in 1965-1967, and in 1980 became addicted to heroin, methadone and Dilaudid. In September, 1982, he began dealing in drugs himself, with his first supplier being one \u201cPops Brooks\u201d in Oklahoma City. He then bought from Robert Dean Phillips and Larry Church two or three times and when they quit business, he was obliged to go to Houston for a supplier, where he paid $27 per tablet. Robert Phillips then approached him with an offer of $26 per tablet, and the Cawthons began buying from him in Oklahoma City. Caw-thon testified that he met Smith one time at one of the drug transactions. After Phillips became sick, deliveries were made to Cawthon by John \u201cLou\u201d Lecas. All of these deliveries were made in Oklahoma City, with cash transactions of $20,000 to $50,000 per trip. Cawthon testified that he sometimes purchased 1,000 Dilaudid tablets per week.</p>\n<p id=\"b1056-10\">Robert Dean Phillips, one of the conspirators, testified that he had known the defendant Don Smith since 1970, and that when he first went into the drug business in 1982, Smith put up the money \u2014 $12,500, with which they bought 500 Dilaudid tablets from a supplier in Houston, and which they sold to one Larry Church, a dealer in Oklahoma City. Phillips testified that he moved up to Oklahoma City in order to \u201cprotect the money,\u201d and that from time to time, Smith came up to Oklahoma City to get his share of the profits. After seven months or so in Oklahoma City, the dealer Larry Church was arrested so Phillips and Smith quit the drug business and Phillips moved back to Texas, staying for a while with Smith and his wife in Corpus Christi.</p>\n<p id=\"b1057-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"973\">*973</page-number>Phillips testified that in September, 1983, he and Smith started up in the drug business again, this time buying their Dilaudid from Tom Burton, an old friend from Chicago. Phillips testified that he and Smith picked up drugs from Burton in Memphis, Forest Hills, Arkansas, and in Oklahoma City where they met Burton at the South-gate, Continental or Grand Continental Motels. Phillips stated that he had met Burton at the Southgate four or five times and he testified that defendant had travelled with him to Oklahoma City eight or nine times, and that from September to December, 1983, he made three to four trips a month to Oklahoma City, distributing drugs to the Cawthon brothers.</p>\n<p id=\"b1057-4\">Phillips testified that when he became ill in mid-December, 1983 and was in the hospital for two weeks, John Lecas, an old acquaintance, took over pick-up and deliveries for him.</p>\n<p id=\"b1057-5\">John Lecas testified that he owned a bar in Houston, had known Phillips since Chicago days in 1964, and that he became acquainted with defendant Smith about 1969. His evidence was that in December, 1983, Phillips asked him to make a trip to Oklahoma City with Smith to deliver drugs to the Cawthon brothers and that he did so. They travelled in Smith\u2019s car to Oklahoma City, where they sold 1500 tablets of Dilau-did for $30,000 to $40,000 cash at the Continental Motel on 1-35 South. Don Smith carried a gun on the occasion the money was paid to Smith. Lecas was paid $500 for the trip, and while Smith talked about splitting profits three ways with Lecas, that never happened. Lecas testified that he agreed with Phillips to make trips through March and April, 1984. He picked up tablets from Burton or Vandiver in Chicago, sold them to the Cawthons in Oklahoma City, and then took the money back to Phillips in Texas. Lecas stated that he was paid_$1.00 per tablet for this service, and that Phillips and Smith divided the profits.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1057-9\">Other independent evidence corroborated the testimony of Phillips, Lecas and Caw-thon. Registration cards for the Southgate Inn on South 1-35 in Oklahoma City were introduced in evidence. The registrations were for September 30, October 8, 9,15, 26, November 2, 10, 12, 17, 1983 \u2014 and for January 13, 29, February 3 and 14, 1984. Each card indicated the number of people using the room. The registration for October 9 was in the name of Tom Burton. All others were in the name of Robert Phillips. The desk clerk was able to identify Robert Phillips because he had noticed and admired his jewelry.</p>\n<p id=\"b1057-10\">Telephone records were introduced listing toll billing charges to Don Smith\u2019s credit card number in Corpus Christi from September, 1983 to January, 1984. These calls were to telephone numbers for the various parties involved in the conspiracy, in Houston, Oklahoma City, and Chicago. Some of the calls charged to the Smith account were made from Purcell, near Oklahoma City on September 10, October 4, 18, 23, 26, 29, 30, and November 4 and 16, 1983. Some of these calls were made <em>to </em>the Don Smith number in Corpus Christi. Mrs. Smith testified that she knew Robert Phillips and Tom Burton, but did not know the other conspirators. She stated that she had never called any of these people on the Smith credit card.</p>\n<p id=\"b1057-11\">The indictment in this case charged Smith with travel and distribution \u201con or about\u201d the dates of November 2,10 and 29, 1983. The court instructed the jury that the proof as to dates \u201cneed not establish with certainty the exact date of any alleged offense because it (was) sufficient if the evidence in the case established beyond a reasonable doubt that the offense charged <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"974\">*974</page-number>were committed on dates reasonably near the dates alleged.\u201d Such an instruction was appropriate and proper under the law of this Circuit. <em>Tafoya v. United States, </em>386 F.2d 537 (10 Cir.1967), and see, <em>United States v. Francisco, </em>575 F.2d 815 (10 Cir.1978). The evidence discussed above was sufficient to sustain Smith\u2019s convictions on the travel and distribution counts \u201con or about\u201d the dates mentioned in the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1058-4\">With respect to the conspiracy count, defendant contends that the proof failed because the testimony of his co-conspirators was inadmissible to prove any act which occurred out of his presence. For this proposition, defendant cites <em>Glover v. United States, </em>306 F.2d 594 (10 Cir.1962) which concerned the admissibility of <em>hearsay </em>statements. Such citation is inappropriate for the government produced direct evidence of the actual acts and conduct of the defendant, all of which were sufficient to prove Smith\u2019s knowledge of the distribution scheme, his possession and distribution of drugs, and his partnership in the scheme to distribute Dilaudid in Oklahoma City.</p>\n<p id=\"b1058-5\">The credibility of the witnesses and the persuasiveness of the documentary evidence were matters for the jury to decide, and in this case, the jury found sufficient evidence to convict.</p>\n<p id=\"b1058-6\">Smith contends that the guilty pleas of his co-conspirators were used as substantive evidence against him, thereby resulting in prejudicial error requiring retrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b1058-7\">Each of the three co-conspirators who testified for the government, Cawthon, Phillips and Lecas, testified to the fact that he had pled guilty to an offense relating to his involvement in the scheme described in the indictment here. In cross examining Smith who testified on his own behalf, the prosecutor asked:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1058-8\">\u201cQ. I guess my final question then is along this line. Everybody that has come into this courtroom under oath that have already either been in prison or plead guilty in connection with the dope deals that you all were doing have come in and not told the truth about your involvement?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1058-11\">In addition, the prosecutor noted in closing arguments that each witness had pled guilty to a charge connected with the Dilaudid distribution scheme, and the remark was made that \u201cat least Robert Dean Phillips was man enough ... He was a convicted felon.\u201d The prosecutor continued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AGhP\">\u201cI never asked you to like him, just listen to him. And, as we say in this business, you don\u2019t find swans in sewers. The type of people that are dealing in narcotics and Dilaudid, and what-not, are his very type, and you have to pull them out of prisons to testify____\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1058-14\">\u201cMr. Lecus. He plead guilty to a telephone count. He told you he wasn\u2019t using drugs. He went in December with this man to Oklahoma City, was present when the drugs were transferred, saw the money. They had these briefcases with the \u201c357\u201d, as in the gun, combination. That\u2019s all verified.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1058-15\">No instructions whatsoever were given to the jury concerning the nature or effect of the co-conspirators guilty pleas.</p>\n<p id=\"b1058-16\">Under our decisions in <em>United States v. Baez, </em>703 F.2d 453 (10 Cir.1983), and <em>United States v. Austin, </em>786 F.2d 986 (10 Cir.1986) we are obliged to reverse and remand this case for new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b1058-17\">In <em>Baez, </em>we ruled that a co-defendant\u2019s guilty plea may not be used as substantive evidence of guilt. If a co-defendant does testify, evidence of his guilty plea may be elicited in order that the jury may fully consider the credibility of the witness, but in such circumstance, \u201c(b)ecause of the potential for prejudice, cautionary instructions limiting the jury\u2019s use of the guilty plea to permissible purposes are <em>critical.\u201d </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"975\">*975</page-number>(Emphasis supplied) In <em>Austin, supra, </em>where we noted that the general rule applies to convictions of co-conspirators, as well as to convictions of co-defendants, the jury was informed in opening and closing statements and through the testimony of the government\u2019s chief witness and others, that ten co-conspirators had been previously tried and convicted for their participation in the conspiracy with which the defendants were charged. As in this case, no cautionary instructions were given. We there found plain error, and reversed for new trial: (786 F.2d at 992)</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1059-3\">\u201cAlthough two of the previously convicted co-conspirators did appear as Government witnesses and testify to their prior convictions, no cautionary instruction was given informing the jury that this evidence was limited to the issue of credibility, and admonishing the jury that the convictions could not be considered as substantive evidence of guilt.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1059-4\">\u201cIn Baez we held that putting evidence of co-defendants\u2019 convictions before the jury in the absence of a permissible purpose, or without a cautionary instruction limiting the jury\u2019s consideration to a permissible purpose, constituted plain error affecting substantial rights under Fed.R.Crim.P. 52(b).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1059-10\">We reach the same conclusion here. Upon considering the entire record, we \u2018cannot say, with fair assurance, after pondering all that happened without stripping the erroneous action from the whole, that the judgment was not substantially swayed by the error....\u2019 (citing <em>Baez, </em>703 F.2d at 455)....\u201d (footnote omitted)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1059-12\">Although defendant\u2019s counsel did not object or request special instructions with regard to evidence of the guilty pleas, we find plain error affecting the substantial rights of the accused, even though there was no objection. <em>United States v. Baez, supra, </em>703 F.2d at 455. In view of the nature of a conspiracy trial, with the government\u2019s case in chief coming from co-conspirators who had pled guilty, and considering the nature of the prosecutor\u2019s arguments and comments to the jury which were directed to the theme that \u201cbirds of a feather flock together,\u201d we find also plain error which adversely affected Smith\u2019s right to a fair trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b1059-13\">We do not address appellant\u2019s other contentions concerning prosecutorial misconduct and ineffective assistance of counsel since defendant is to have a new trial in any event.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1060-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"976\">*976</page-number>For the reasons discussed above, the judgment is REVERSED, and the case is REMANDED FOR NEW TRIAL.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1056-7\">. 21 U.S.C. Sec. 841(a)(1) provides that \u201cit shall be unlawful for any person knowingly or intentionally \u2014 (1) to manufacture, distribute, or dispense, or possess with intent to manufacture, distribute, or dispense, a controlled sub-stance____\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AJqb\">21 U.S.C.

On January 4, 1984, Smith surrendered himself to federal authorities and since that time has been serving a sentence imposed in Louisiana for smuggling marijuana. The evidence in the case before us tended to prove that Smith continued to receive profits from the Oklahoma City operation even though he was serving the federal sentence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1058-9\">. Phillips testified that he and Smith had identical briefcases, with combinations \"357\u201d, \"like the gun\". These were used to carry drugs and money. Both Phillips and Lecas testified that in December, 1983 the drugs were carried in Phillips\u2019 briefcase. Phillips testified that Lecas and Smith came to his hospital room to pick up that briefcase.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1059-5\">. Among other suggestions, defendant complains that the prosecutor attempted to connect him with the activities of his former club manager \u2014 one Tommy Teutsch, a fugitive on the FBI \"Most Wanted\u201d list, sought in connection with an entirely unrelated drug investigation and involvement in 6 or 8 murders.</p>\n<p id=\"b1059-6\">In extensive cross examination of a defense witness, the prosecutor, without objection, inquired at length into Teutsch\u2019s criminal activities and violent nature, until the Court was obliged to reprimand him:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1059-7\">\u201cTHE COURT: Mr. Richardson, let\u2019s leave U.S. versus Teutsch for another Court at another time, and let\u2019s try the case of U.S. versus Smith from now on.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1059-8\">Even after this admonition, the prosecutor again referred to Teutsch\u2019s bad character in his closing argument, mentioning that he was employed by Smith, and that Smith\u2019s wife had put up bail money for Teutsch:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1059-9\">\"But we know this, that Tom Teutsch isn't on trial, of course, just like the Judge reminded me quite clearly. But the idea is that there is a man just about as bad as anybody you have heard about in this trial, and he was associated not with Robert Dean Phillips or Mr Lecus or the Cawthons, but he was tied in hand and glove with Don Smith.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A1Iv\">\"Lucy Smith tells you she\u2019s a bartender, or something along those lines. Well, it\u2019s on the toll records before us. It lists her as the manager of the Tokyo Massage Parlor, whatever that means.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"asg-dedup-0\">\"But, okay, the Smiths go the $3,000 (for bail) and Teutsch jumps bond, and he (Teutsch\u2019s attorney) just casually talks about the idea he represents him, he was the most wanted man in the United States, he kills, he \u2014 or, as he said, he's accused of all these things, but he (the attorney) gets him off. He kills, he murders, he is Mr. Tough Guy, and he\u2019s working for the Smiths.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A8i\">\n<em>* * * * * *</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A5e\">\"Let him (the defendant) say all the bad, evil things in the world he wants to say about Robert Dean Phillips, because the thumb\u2019s coming right back to that drug-dealing defendant.
