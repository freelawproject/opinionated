Petitioner brought suit under section 921(c)(2) of the Black Lung Benefits Act, 30 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 901-945 (1982) (Act), and the regulation promulgated thereunder. The AU awarded benefits, concluding that petitioner was entitled to invoke the rebuttable presumption that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"641\">*641</page-number>her husband\u2019s death was due to pneumoconiosis conferred by section 921(c)(2) and the implementing regulation because her husband worked more than ten years in the nation's mines and died from lung cancer. In concluding that lung cancer was a chronic lung disease sufficient to invoke the presumption, the ALJ relied on the Board\u2019s decision in <em>Pyle v. Allegheny River Mining Co., 2 </em>Black Lung Rep. 1-1143 (1981). The Board in <em>Pyle </em>concluded that lung cancer was a chronic disease of the lung as a matter of law, and thus was a sufficient basis for invoking the section 921(c)(2) presumption. After the parties argued the present case before the Board, but before the Board reached its decision, the Board overruled its decision in <em>Pyle. Hunter v. Director, Office of Workers\u2019 Compensation Programs, </em>8 Black Lung Rep. 1-120 (1985), <em>appeal docketed, </em>No. 85-2359 (4th Cir. Nov. 14, 1985). In <em>Hunter, </em>the Board held that a claimant has the burden to establish that the miner\u2019s lung cancer was a chronic disease of the lung before the statutory presumption is invoked. The Board in the present case held that <em>Hunter, </em>not <em>Pyle, </em>applied to the case and concluded that petitioner failed to establish that her husband\u2019s lung cancer was a chronic lung disease. Because we believe that petitioner should have the opportunity to prove that her husband\u2019s lung cancer was a chronic lung disease, we reverse the Board\u2019s decision and remand to the Board for further proceedings in accordance with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-5\">Section 921(c)(2) of the Act provides that \u201c[i]f a deceased miner was employed for ten years or more in one or more coal mines and died from a respirable disease there shall be a rebuttable presumption that his death was due to pneumoconiosis.\u201d The implementing regulation provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b741-10\">(a) Even though the existence of pneu-moconiosis as defined in \u00a7 410.110(o)(l) is not established as provided in \u00a7 410.-454(a), if a deceased miner was employed for 10 years or more in the Nation\u2019s coal mines and died from a respirable disease, it will be presumed, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, that his death was due to pneumoconiosis arising out of employment in a coal mine.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b741-11\">(b) Death will be found due to a respirable disease when death is medically ascribed to a chronic dust disease, or to another chronic disease of the lung. Death will not be found due to a respira-ble disease where the disease reported does not suggest a reasonable possibility that death was due to pneumoconiosis. Where the evidence establishes that a deceased miner suffered from pneumoco-niosis or a respirable disease and death may have been due to multiple causes, death will be found due to pneumoconio-sis if it is not medically feasible to distinguish which disease caused death or specifically how much each disease contributed to causing death.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b741-12\">20 C.F.R. \u00a7 410.462 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b741-13\">The first issue we must consider is whether <em>Hunter </em>was correctly decided.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Although the parties did not argue this issue before the Board in the present case,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> we believe that the <em>Hunter </em>Board was correct in concluding that the burden is on claimant in each case to establish the chronic nature of the miner\u2019s lung cancer before the presumption is invoked.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"642\">*642</page-number>statute and regulation provide that a claimant is entitled to the presumption that death was due to pneumoconiosis arising out of employment in a coal mine if the miner worked in a mine for more than ten years and died from a respirable disease under the regulation. Death will be found due to a respirable disease when death is medically ascribed to a chronic dust disease or to another chronic lung disease where the disease suggests a reasonable possibility that death was due to pneumoconiosis. Nothing in the Act or the regulation provides that lung cancer is a chronic lung disease as a matter of law. Furthermore, medical experts disagree about whether lung cancer is a chronic lung disease. Because this Court will defer to an agency\u2019s interpretation of a regulation, provided that this interpretation is reasonable, <em>Chevron U.S.A. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., </em>467 U.S. 837, 842-43, 104 S.Ct. 2778, 2781-82, 81 L.Ed.2d 694 (1984), we conclude that claimants must establish that the miner\u2019s lung cancer constituted a chronic lung disease before the statutory presumption is invoked.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-4\">Petitioner argues that <em>Pyle </em>not <em>Hunter </em>should apply to the facts of this case. Although <em>Pyle </em>was the law when the AU decided this case, the Board was correct in concluding that <em>Hunter </em>was applicable. The Supreme Court has held that a court must apply the law in effect at the time it renders its decision unless doing so results in manifest injustice or there is legislative history or a statutory directive to the contrary. <em>Bradley v. School Board, </em>416 U.S. 696, 711, 94 S.Ct. 2006, 2016, 40 L.Ed.2d 476 (1974). In the present case, applying the rule in <em>Hunter </em>does not result in manifest injustice if petitioner has the opportunity to present proof that the miner\u2019s lung cancer constituted a chronic lung disease and suggests a reasonable possibility that death was due to pneumoconiosis. The Board concluded that claimant did not meet this requirement because the miner\u2019s lung cancer was not described as chronic. As petitioner points out, there was no reason for her to provide testimony on this issue because <em>Pyle, </em>the law at the time of the hearing, held that lung cancer was a chronic lung disease sufficient to invoke the presumption. Accordingly, a remand to the AU is necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-6\">For the reasons stated above, the Board\u2019s decision is reversed and the case is remanded to the Board with instructions to provide claimant the opportunity to submit evidence before the AU.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b741-6\">. This question is also before the Fourth Circuit on appeal from <em>Hunter.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b741-7\"><em>. </em>Courts of Appeals have plenary authority to review the Board\u2019s legal conclusions. <em>Gibas v. Saginaw Mining Co., </em>748 F.2d 1112, 1119 (6th Cir.1984), <em>cert. denied, </em>471 U.S. 1116, 105 S.Ct. 2357, 86 L.Ed.2d 258 (1985). Nevertheless, this Court has stated that it refuses to decide substantive legal questions not presented to the Board. <em>Id. </em>In the present case, however, the parties did not argue before the Board whether <em>Hunter </em>or <em>Pyle </em>was correct because <em>Hunter </em>had not been decided. Accordingly, because of the unique procedural posture of this case, we believe it proper to consider this issue.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b741-15\">. The Board in <em>Hunter </em>also concluded that even if the presumption that the miner\u2019s death was due to pneumoconiosis was invoked, there was sufficient evidence to rebut it. According to the Board, the statute and regulation provide that the presumption may be rebutted by establishing that there is no reasonable possibility that death was due to pneumoconiosis, that the miner did not have pneumoconiosis, or that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"642\">*642</page-number>miner\u2019s death was not causally related to coal mine employment. The ALJ\u2019s finding that the lung cancer was not attributable to anything let alone pneumoconiosis is, according to the Board, sufficient to establish that there is no reasonable possibility that death was due to pneumoconiosis. We have considerable difficulty in accepting the <em>Hunter </em>approach that the absence of evidence can rebut a presumption. We suggest that a more reasoned approach, in view of the regulation, is that it is part of the definition of respirable disease that it suggests such reasonable possibility. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 410.462(b).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
