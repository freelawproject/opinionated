Did a savings clause subjecting New Jersey Transit Corporation (N.J. Transit) to \u201capplicable laws of the United States related to ... dealings between employees and employers\u201d preserve its exemption from the overtime rules of the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA)? The district court found, based on the \u201cplain language\u201d of the statute, that it did not. We conclude that the statute, when read with an eye to its purpose and to the regulatory scheme in existence at the time <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>of its enactment, evidences an intent to preserve the FLSA overtime exemption.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-5\">N.J. Transit, an instrumentality of the State of New Jersey that operates commuter rail service, was sued by New Jersey Transit Policemen\u2019s Benevolent Association, Local 304 (Local 304), for failure to comply with the provision of the Fair Labor Standards Act that requires employers to pay employees one and one-half times their regular wage for hours worked in excess of forty per week. 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 207(a) (1982). N.J. Transit moved to dismiss this claim, asserting that its employees fell within one of the categorical exemptions from the overtime rules listed in Section 213(b). The relevant provision exempts:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AN_\">any employee of an employer engaged in the operation of a common carrier by rail and subject to the provisions of subchap-ter I of chapter 105 of title 49 [Part I of the Interstate Commerce Act]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b552-6\">29 U.S.C. \u00a7 213(b)(2) (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b552-7\">In response to the motion to dismiss, Local 304 pointed out that N.J. Transit was not currently subject to the provisions of Interstate Commerce Act (ICA) and argued that it was accordingly not entitled to the exemption provided by Section 213(b)(2) of the FLSA. While N.J. Transit acknowledged that it was not now subject to Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC) regulation, it insisted that the 1976 statute removing commuter railroads such as N.J. Transit from the jurisdiction of the ICC included a savings clause which preserved their overtime exemption. This 1976 statute, now codified as amended at 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 10504, reads in relevant part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AEr\">(b) The Interstate Commerce Commission does not have jurisdiction under this subtitle over rail mass transportation provided by a local public body if\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b552-8\">(1) the Commission would have jurisdiction but for this section; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b552-9\">(2) the fares of the local public body, or its authority to apply to the Commission for changes in those fares, is subject to the approval or disapproval of the chief executive officer of the State in which the transportation is provided.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b552-11\">(c) Notwithstanding subsection (b) of this section, a local body, described in subsection (b), is subject to applicable laws of the United States related to\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b552-12\">(1) safety;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b552-13\">(2) the representation of employees for collective bargaining; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b552-14\">(3) employment retirement, annuity, and unemployment systems or other provisions related to dealings between employees and employers.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b552-15\">49 U.S.C. \u00a7 10504 (1982). The parties agree that N.J. Transit satisfies the conditions for the Section 10504(b) exemption from ICC regulation. They disagree only with respect to the effect of the Section 10504(c) savings clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-16\">The district court denied N.J. Transit\u2019s motion to dismiss holding that the Section 10504(c) savings clause did not preserve the Section 213(b)(2) overtime exemption. It also determined that the order denying N.J. Transit\u2019s motion to dismiss involved \u201ca controlling question of law as to which there is substantial ground for difference of opinion and [that] an immediate appeal from the order may advance the ultimate termination of the litigation.\u201d App. at 4. This court granted N.J. Transit\u2019s petition for appeal of the statutory construction question pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292(b). Accordingly, the only issue before us is whether the Section 213(b)(2) overtime exemption is preserved by the Section 10504(c) savings clause. Our review of questions of statutory interpretation is plenary.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-17\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-18\">\u201cWhere, as here, resolution of a question of federal law turns on a statute and the intention of Congress, we look first to the statutory language and then to the legislative history if statutory language is unclear.\u201d <em>Blum v. Stenson, </em>465 U.S. 886, 896, 104 S.Ct. 1541, 1548, 79 L.Ed.2d 891 (1984). In seeking to discern Congression<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>al intent from the legislative text, a court must be mindful of the statute\u2019s object and policy and must read the disputed provision in the context of the entire statute and the provisions of related statutes. <em>Richards v. United States, </em>369 U.S. 1, 11, 82 S.Ct. 585, 591, 7 L.Ed.2d 492 (1962); <em>Commissioner of Internal Revenue v. Engle, </em>464 U.S. 206, 217, 104 S.Ct. 597, 604, 78 L.Ed.2d 420 (1984); <em>Kokoszka v. Belford, </em>417 U.S. 642, 650, 94 S.Ct. 2431, 2436, 41 L.Ed.2d 374 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b553-5\">A. <em>The Text</em></p>\n<p id=\"b553-6\">The relevant provision states that, notwithstanding Section 10504(b), commuter railroads like N.J. Transit are \u201csubject to applicable laws of the United States related to\u2014(1) safety; (2) the representation of employees for collective bargaining; and (3) employment retirement, annuity, and unemployment systems or other provisions related to dealings between employees and employers.\u201d 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 10504(c) (1982). The district court read \u201cdealings\u201d in the last clause to mean \u201cbusiness interactions,\u201d which it found to include negotiations over collective bargaining agreements but not rules concerning wages or hours. App. at 41. We disagree. The use of the phrase \u201cother provisions related to dealings between employees and employers\u201d in conjunction with the preceding references to safety, labor negotiations, retirement, and unemployment implies that Congress had a broad conception of \u201cdealings.\u201d Moreover, the district court\u2019s equation of dealings with negotiations would render the final clause of the provision redundant, given the language of Section 10504(c)(2) preserving laws \u201crelated to ... the representation of employees for collective bargaining,\u201d a reference to the Railway Labor Act. 45 U.S.C. \u00a7 151, <em>et seq. </em>In short, a law concerning overtime pay requirements is, on its face, a provision relating to dealings, or business interactions, between employees and employers.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-7\">A more plausible argument is that the phrase \u201csubject to applicable laws of the United States\u201d refers only to affirmative regulation imposed by federal law and not to exemptions from such statutory regulation. This argument was apparently adopted by the district court when it found that \u201c \u2018applicable laws of the United States\u2019 refers to broad statutory schemes ... not to narrowly tailored specific exemptions from statutory schemes.\u201d App. at 16. The <em>amicus curiae </em>makes the same argument in somewhat different terms when it asserts that the phrase \u201csubject to\u201d is inconsistent with the preservation of a regulatory exemption since a railroad cannot be \u201csubject to\u201d a beneficial exception. While we find this parsing of the legislative text plausible, it is not compelling. The point is not whether this somewhat inartfully drafted statute means to make N.J. Transit \u201csubject to\u201d a beneficial exemption. The statute makes N.J. Transit \u201csubject to applicable laws\u201d and the question then is whether Section 207(a) of the FLSA is an \u201capplicable law\u201d or not. If the Section 207(a) overtime provisions are meant not to be applicable because of the exemption, then N.J. Transit is simply not \u201csubject to\u201d <em>the overtime requirements; </em>thus, the semantic problem of being \u201csubject to\u201d an exemption would appear to be off the mark. The real issue, then, is whether the Congressional intent was that \u201capplicable laws\u201d <em>include </em>the FLSA overtime requirements, or continue, as had been the case for the preceding four decades, to <em>exclude </em>those provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-9\">Textual parsing, especially here, is not alone an indisputable indication of Congressional intent. Rather, we believe this textual analysis must be tested by reference to the purpose of the statute and the legislative history. When the savings clause is read against this background, it becomes clear that it was intended to maintain the status quo in all of the areas referred to in subsection (c) and that this result can be achieved only by construing it to preserve the overtime exemption as well as coverage by the railroad employment laws.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-10\">B. <em>The Statutory Purpose</em></p>\n<p id=\"b553-11\">Initially, it is important to put the savings clause of Section 10504 in the context <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>of the law as it existed immediately before its adoption by Congress. Historically, Congress has elected to regulate the relationship of railroad workers with their employers in a series of statutes independent of those which apply to other industrial workers and their employers. Thus, the Railway Labor Act, 45 U.S.C. \u00a7 151, <em>et seq., </em>rather than the Labor Management Relations Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 141, <em>et seq., </em>governs labor-management relations in the railroad industry. Other examples include the Railroad Retirement Tax Act, 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 3231, <em>et seq., </em>the Railroad Retirement Act of 1974, 45 U.S.C. \u00a7 231, <em>et seq., </em>the Railroad Unemployment Insurance Act, 45 U.S.C. \u00a7 351, <em>et seq., </em>the Federal Employee Liability Act, 45 U.S.C. \u00a7 54, and the Hours of Service Law, 45 U.S.C. \u00a7 61. All of these statutes were in force in 1976 immediately prior to the passage of Section 10504. The 1976 regulatory environment for railroads also included Section 213(b)(2) of the FLSA which exempted railroad workers from the overtime provisions of that Act. The Railway Labor Act, 45 U.S.C. \u00a7 151, the Railroad Retirement Tax Act, 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 3231(g), the Railroad Retirement Act, 45 U.S.C. \u00a7 231(a)(l)(i), the Railroad Unemployment Insurance Act, 45 U.S.C. \u00a7 351(b), and the Section 213(b)(2) overtime exemption each defined their applicability by reference to the Interstate Commerce Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-4\">The exemption from the overtime provisions of the FLSA was granted to railroads in recognition of the nature of railroad operations and the fact that such operations may result in irregular hours for railroad workers. <em>See Southland Gasoline Co. v. Bayley, </em>319 U.S. 44, 48-49, 63 S.Ct. 917, 919-20, 87 L.Ed. 1244 (1943). The reference to the ICA was made solely for the purpose of identifying the workers to be covered by the exemption and not because the ICA provided an alternative scheme for regulating overtime compensation. This is clear from the fact that the scope of the exemption, as originally proposed, was defined by reference to employees covered by the Hours of Service Act and reference to the ICA was substituted by amendment in order to make sure that all types of railroad workers were included in the exemption.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>See Keele v. Union Pacific Railroad Co., </em>78 F.Supp. 678 (S.D.Cal.1948) and the legislative history detailed therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-8\">It is undisputed that commuter rail lines, such as the service now operated by N.J. Transit, were subject to this special railroad regulatory scheme \u2014 including ICC regulation, coverage by the railroad employment statutes, and exemption from the overtime provisions of the FLSA \u2014 prior to the passage of Section 10504 in 1976.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-9\">Section 10504, as the district court recognized, represents a Congressional judgment that ICC regulation of publicly-operated commuter rail lines is unnecessary when their fares are subject to control by the chief executive of a state. Thus, the purpose of Section 10504 was to free this subclass of railroads from redundant rate control mechanisms by removing it from the jurisdiction of the ICC. The issue presented by this case is whether Section 10504 also reflects a Congressional intent to otherwise alter the regulatory environment in which this subclass of railroads had been operating prior to its passage. We find no evidence of such an intent. To the contrary, when Section 10504 is read in the context of the pre-existing law, we believe it evidences an intent to preserve the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>status quo in all of the areas subsumed under Section 10504(c), including the area of overtime compensation.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-5\">The Section 10504(c) savings provision is necessary because, as we have seen, a number of statutes regulating the activities of railroads define their applicability by reference to the Interstate Commerce Act. The reference in subsection (c)(2) to \u201cthe representation of employees for collective bargaining,\u201d for example, clearly preserves the regulation afforded by the Railway Labor Act. The references to \u201cretirement, annuity, and unemployment systems\u201d preserve the regulation provided by the Railroad Retirement Tax Act, the Railroad Retirement Act of 1974, and the Railroad Unemployment Insurance Act. Similarly, we believe the sweeping reference to \u201cother provisions related to dealings between employees and employers\u201d reflects a Congressional intent to preserve the regulatory status quo with respect to other statutes in the area of employment relations whose applicability might have been altered by changing the ICC\u2019s jurisdiction.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b555-6\">In this context, we think it highly unlikely that Congress used the phrase \u201csubject to applicable laws of the United States\u201d to indicate that only statutes affirmatively regulating railroad activity, and not exemptions, were to be preserved. The district court\u2019s reading of this phrase necessarily attributes to Congress a decision to impose a hybrid and unique regulatory environment on this small subclass of railroads, one involving both the special railroad employment statutes and the FLSA overtime rules. Yet, neither Local 304 nor the <em>ami-cus curiae </em>has suggested any reason why Congress might have chosen to fashion such a hybrid scheme applicable only to publicly-operated commuter lines whose fares are controlled by the chief executive of their states. While the statutory definition of this subclass of railroad provides a ready explanation as to why Congress might decide to remove them from ICC jurisdiction, there is nothing about the subclass which would suggest a rationale for changing the laws governing their employee relations. In particular, we can perceive no reason why Congress might wish commuter rail lines whose rates are controlled in this manner to be subject to the overtime provisions of the FLSA while other commuter rail lines remain entitled to the Section 213(b)(2) exemption. In short, consideration of the purpose of Section 10504 and the regulatory context in which it was enacted strongly suggests that the savings clause was intended to preserve the status quo across the entire spectrum of railroad-employment regulation. We turn now to the legislative history.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-9\">C. <em>The Legislative History</em></p>\n<p id=\"Anxa\">The ICA exemption now contained in Section 10504 was originally enacted as a part of the Railroad Revitalization and Regulatory Reform Act of 1976. Pub. L. No. 94-210, \u00a7 804, 90 Stat. 31, 139 (1976). The exemption in this statute was broader than the current law, exempting from ICC regulation all commuter passenger service provided by local public bodies. The savings clause was contained in this first effort. Later in the same year, Congress, as a part of the Rail Transportation Improvement Act, narrowed the ICA exemption to railroad commuter passenger service provided by local public bodies the fares of which were subject to control by the chief executive officer of the state. Pub. L. No. 94-555, \u00a7 206, 90 Stat. 2613, 2621 (1976). The legislative histories of these Acts comment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>only briefly on Section 10504. In neither instance is anything said or done which suggests that Congress believed it was effecting any change other than a narrowing of the ICC\u2019s jurisdiction.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b556-4\">When Congress abandons previously articulated policies, one \u201cwould normally expect some expression by Congress that such results are intended.\u201d <em>United States v. United Continental Tuna Corp., </em>425 U.S. 164, 169, 96 S.Ct. 1319, 1323, 47 L.Ed.2d 653 (1976). Finding no such expression here in the legislative history and further finding in the statutory text a strong indication that Congress intended to maintain the status quo in the area of employment relations, we hold that Section 10504 does not deprive N.J. Transit of its exemption from the overtime provisions of the FLSA.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-6\">In response to the question certified by the district court, we conclude that the Section 213(b)(2) exemption from the overtime provisions of the FLSA was preserved by the Section 10504(c) savings clause. It follows that the district court erred in denying N.J. Transit\u2019s motion for dismissal of the overtime claim. We therefore vacate the order denying N.J. Transit\u2019s motion so that the district court may enter an order consistent with this opinion. Each party will bear its own costs.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b554-5\">. The dissent argues that exemptions from the FLSA should be narrowly construed. There is, however, no dispute as to the meaning of \u00a7 213(b)(2). The pertinent question is whether \u00a7 10504(c) should be construed to provide for the continued application of \u00a7 213(b)(2) notwithstanding the change in ICC jurisdiction enacted in \u00a7 10504(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b554-6\">Moreover, unlike the dissent, we believe the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Garcia </em>v. <em>San Antonio Metropolitan Transit Authority, </em>469 U.S. 528, 105 S.Ct. 1005, 83 L.Ed.2d 1016 (1985), is unhelpful in resolving this dispute. <em>Garcia </em>involved an intrastate bus operator, not a railroad. The one-time exemption from the FLSA discussed in <em>Garda, </em>namely 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 213(a)(9) [repealed], related to employees of local mass transit operators. The overtime exemption applicable to railroad employees under \u00a7 213(b)(2) was not at issue.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b555-7\">. The dissent argues that N.J. Transit does not quality for the \u00a7 213(b)(2) overtime exemption unless we find that \u00a7 10504(c) saved Part I of the ICA with respect to N.J. Transit. While we agree with the dissent that it would be absurd to find that \u00a7 10504(c) preserved the ICC regulation explicitly halted in \u00a7 10504(b), we do not agree that such a finding is necessary to find that N.J. Transit continues to qualify for the overtime exemption. We note that ICC jurisdiction determines the applicability of the Railway Labor Act, the Railroad Retirement Act, the Railroad Retirement Tax Act, and the Railroad Unemployment Insurance Act. Judge Garth\u2019s formulation would necessarily lead to the conclusion that these laws, in addition to the overtime exemption, no longer apply to N.J. Transit. Under this analysis, we would perceive no function that is served by the savings clause.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b556-9\">. <em>See, e.g., </em>S.Conf.Rep.

The PBA argues that 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 207, the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA), entitles its members who work overtime at these and other tasks to overtime rates of compensation instead of \u201cstraight pay.\u201d NJT, on the other hand, claims that it need not pay overtime, because NJT comes within the terms of 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 213(b)(2), which exempts certain rail carriers from the operation of \u00a7 207.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-13\">The majority agrees with NJT and holds that NJT is excluded from paying overtime rates by virtue of a statutory exemption from paying such overtime for \u201cany employee of an employer engaged in the operation of a common carrier by rail and <em>subject to the provisions of Part I of the Interstate Commerce Act </em>\u201d (ICA). 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 213(b)(2) (emphasis added). Part I of the ICA contains the rate regulatory provisions of the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-14\">In my view, NJT is not exempt from the overtime rate requirements prescribed by the Fair Labor Standards Act, as it cannot be considered \u201csubject to\u201d the provisions of Part I of the ICA, or the catch-all clause of 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 10504(c)(3). Consequently, I am satisfied that NJT must adhere to the requirements of 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 207 and pay overtime rates for overtime work. Accordingly, I must dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-15\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-16\">New Jersey Transit concedes that it was exempted from the fare regulations provided in Part I of the ICA because its fares are subject <em>not </em>to ICA approval but to approval by the Governor of New Jersey. Appellant\u2019s brief at 8; 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 10504(b). Because the Commission has no jurisdiction over NJT owing to this circumstance, NJT cannot share in the overtime exemption [29 U.S.C. \u00a7 213(b)(2) ] given to those rail carriers who <em>are </em>regulated by ICA. This immunity from ICA fare regulation, and therefore ICA jurisdiction, represents a benefit or privilege granted by Congress to NJT. See brief of Amicus Curiae at 5; <em>see also </em>infra, dis. op., at 458-59.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-18\">NJT asserts, however, that an obscure clause found within an ambiguous proviso <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>of 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 10504(c), which itself is found within a subsidiary provision of that statute\u201449 U.S.C. \u00a7 10504(c)(3) \u2014 restores to NJT the overtime exemption which it otherwise would have lost because it was no longer under ICA jurisdiction. 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 10504(c) provides in full:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b557-5\">(c) Notwithstanding subsection (b) of this section, a <em>local public body, described in subsection (b), is subject to applicable laws </em>of the United States <em>related </em>to\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b557-6\">(1) safety;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b557-7\">(2) the representation of employees for collective bargaining; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b557-8\">(3) employment retirement, annuity, and employment systems or other <em>provisions related to dealings between employees and employers.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b557-9\">NJT relies upon so much of the statute as I have underlined above and which reads; \u201c... a local public body, described in subsection (b), is subject to applicable laws related to ... provisions related to dealings between employees and employers.\u201d Thus NJT, to succeed, must first establish that the \u201capplicable law\u201d to which it is subject is the Interstate Commerce Act, Part I, which regulates rates. Secondly, it must establish that the \u201cprovision related to dealings between employees and employers\u201d \u201csubjects\u201d NJT to 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 213(b)(2), and thus would free NJT from paying overtime rates for overtime work. Without even consideration of the tortured construction of 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 10504(c)(3)\u2014 which NJT must urge in order to give any semblance to its argument \u2014 it is evident that NJT cannot bring itself within the overtime exemption statute because Part I of ICA cannot be an \u201capplicable law\u201d insofar as NJT is concerned.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b557-10\">NJT and the majority opinion maintain that owing to \u00a7 10504(c), NJT has been subjected to the terms of the Railroad Labor Act; subjected to the terms of the Railroad Retirement Act; subjected to the laws of the Pension System; subjected to the Federal Employers Liability Act; and subjected to other Federal laws which regulate the nationwide railroad system. App. at 61-2. They more significantly contend that \u00a7 10504(c) \u201csubjects\u201d NJT to the \u201cother provisions related to dealings between employees and employers,\u201d or, in the context of this case, to the exemption from overtime pay that ICC regulated carriers enjoy. Appellant\u2019s Brief at 20.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-13\">I cannot agree, for at least four reasons. First, this analysis is contrary to our court\u2019s accepted approach to the interpretation of exemptions from FLSA overtime pay requirements. Second, it cannot be harmonized with the legislative history of Part I of the ICA. Third, this line of reasoning conflicts with the result that would be reached through ordinary principles of statutory construction. Finally, not only does the majority distort the plain language of \u00a7 10504(c), but also it errs in attributing to \u00a7 10504(c) the obligations to which NJT is subject and which originate in other statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-14\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-15\">Recognizing a need for a national wage and overtime policy, there has been a congressional trend, recognized by the Supreme Court in <em>Garcia v. San Antonio Metropolitan Transit Authority, </em>469 U.S. 528, 105 S.Ct. 1005, 83 L.Ed.2d 1016 (1985), to expand, rather than to contract the protections extended to workers through the FLSA overtime provision. In <em>Garcia, </em>the Court observed that Congress has been ever more inclusive in applying FLSA to mass transit authorities:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b557-16\">When the FLSA was enacted in 1938, its wage and overtime provisions did not apply to local mass-transit employees or, indeed, to employees of state and local <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>governments. In 1961, Congress extended minimum-wage coverage to employees of any private mass-transit carrier whose annual gross revenue was not less than $1 million. Five years later, Congress extended FLSA coverage to state and local-government employees for the first time by withdrawing the minimum-wage and overtime exemptions from public hospitals, schools, and mass-transit carriers whose rates and services were subject to state regulation. At the same time, Congress eliminated the overtime exemption for all mass-transit employees other than drivers, operators, and con-ductors____ The FLSA obligations of public mass-transit systems like [San Antonio\u2019s] were expanded in 1974 when Congress provided for the progressive repeal of the surviving overtime exemption for mass-transit employees. Congress simultaneously brought the States and their subdivisions further within the ambit of the FLSA by extending FLSA coverage to virtually all state and local-government employees.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b558-5\"><em>Garcia, </em>105 S.Ct. at 1008-9 (1985) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b558-6\">Both in this court and elsewhere, exceptions to the overtime requirements of the FLSA are to be read narrowly. \u201cExemptions from the Fair Labor Standards Act are to be narrowly construed against the employer. The burden of proof is on the employer to establish an exemption.\u201d <em>Guthrie v. Lady Jane Collieries, Inc., </em>722 F.2d 1141, 1143 (3d Cir.1983). <em>See also Idaho Sheet Metal Works, Inc. v. Wirtz, </em>383 U.S. 190, 86 S.Ct. 737, 15 L.Ed.2d 694 (1966); <em>Paul v. Petroleum Equipment Tools Co., </em>708 F.2d 168 (5th Cir.1983); <em>Brennan v. South Davis Community Hospital, </em>538 F.2d 859 (10th Cir.1976); <em>Brennan v. Southern Productions, Inc., </em>513 F.2d 740 (6th Cir.1975); <em>Hodgson v. Elk Garden Corp., </em>482 F.2d 529 (4th Cir.1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b558-7\">The record in this case is utterly barren of proof of Congressional intent to exempt carriers such as NJT from paying overtime rates. Indeed, in Part III of this dissent, I call attention to the legislative history of \u00a7 10504, which clearly mandates that NJT\u2019s purported exemption from paying overtime rates cannot be revived by any reference to the Interstate Commerce Act as an \u201capplicable law\u201d. Thus, to the extent that NJT must carry the burden to establish an exemption, this record reveals that NJT has failed. And to the extent that the majority opinion construes \u00a7 10504(c) in such an overly expansive fashion, so as to provide NJT with an exemption from overtime pay where none has been authorized by Congress, that interpretation runs counter to the views that have been expressed by judicial authorities including the Supreme Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-9\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-10\">The majority maintains that it is implausible to suppose that Congress intended to require carriers such as NJT to pay overtime rates when Congress enacted \u00a7 10504, because reference to the Interstate Commerce Act in the Fair Labor Standard Act was \u201cmade solely for the purpose of identifying the workers to be covered by the exemption and not because the ICA provided an alternative scheme for regulating overtime compensation.\u201d Maj. Op., at 454. In this way, the majority construes the FLSA provision [29 U.S.C. \u00a7 213(b)(2) ] as one which would ensure that all types of railroad workers were included in the FLSA overtime exemption. I cannot agree with this simplistic argument which has no precedent whatsoever for its support.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-11\">It should be noted, first, that <em>Keele v. Union Pacific R.R., </em>78 F.Supp. 678 (1948), upon which the majority relies, maj. op., at 454, holds that the overtime provision [\u00a7 213(b)(2)] is unambiguous, and precise; it \u201cmeans exactly what it says: \u2018The provisions of Section 7 [an earlier codification of the overtime exemption] shall not apply with respect to----(2) any employee of an employer subject to the provisions of Part I [rate regulations] of the Interstate Commerce Act.\u2019 There is no exception and there is no limitation.\u201d 78 F.Supp. at 682-83. Nothing in <em>Keele </em>or any other provision of either statute, or, in the legislative <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>history, can bring NJT, which is <em>not </em>under ICA regulations, within the exemption provisions of \u00a7 213(b)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b559-5\">Second, while it is true that the unique legislative history of the railroad industry may have fostered a broad overtime exemption from FLSA requirements, it is also true that the peculiar aspects of <em>commuter </em>rail systems led to the limited, experimental deregulatory option which Congress, in 1976, provided only to commuter rail systems, thus permitting such systems to escape Interstate Commerce regulations. New Jersey Transit chose to take advantage of this escape route from its very inception, and by doing so, lost the concom-mitant right to be free from paying overtime rates.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-6\">Thus, while ICA fare regulation and exemption from overtime rates was extended to the broad category of rail mass transit, NJT and similar commuter rail lines obtained the possibility of immunity from such fare regulations (a benefit), while suffering whatever burdens (including payment of overtime rates) might ensue. NJT did so in the process of political negotiation that accompanied the passage of the Rail Revitalization and Regulatory Reform Act of 1976, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 10504. <em>See, e.g., </em>122 Cong. Rec. H35,158 (daily ed. Oct. 1, 1976) (statement of Rep. Skubitz). <em>See also </em>Conference Report, Pub.L. 94-555, 5 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Adm.News 5837, 5863 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b559-7\">Contrary to the majority\u2019s view, the legislative history of negotiations that occurred prior to the enactment of the 1976 amendments to the Rail Revitalization and Regulatory Reform Act of 1976 suggests that the purpose of \u00a7 10504 was not merely to avoid \u201credundant rate control mechanisms,\u201d as the majority claims, maj. op., at 454, but rather, it was part of a larger effort to promote substantive regulatory reform. 122 Cong. Rec. H35,158 (daily ed. Oct. 1, 1976); Conference Report, Pub.L. 94-555, 5 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Adm. News 5863 (1976). Nowhere in the \u201creform\u201d legislation is it intimated that an exemption from overtime payments was to be retained by intrastate commuter rail carriers while at the same time the same carriers were to receive local rate autonomy. Thus the reference to \u201capplicable law\u201d found in \u00a7 10504(c) must be read as a limitation on the degree of freedom from regulation being conferred, not as a preservation by Congress of the pre-1976 amendment status quo, as the majority claims. <em>See </em>Maj.Op., at 453.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-9\">Furthermore, the legislative history of \u00a7 10504 indicates that the regulatory apparatus of the ICA (Part I, concerned with rates) was not among the \u201capplicable laws\u201d to which \u00a7 10504 refers. The predecessor to \u00a7 10504(c) stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b559-10\">(1)(A) <em>Except as provided in subpara-graph (B) of this paragraph, </em>no local public body which provides mass transportation services by rail, and which is otherwise subject to the Interstate Commerce Act shall, with respect to the provision of such services, be subject to the Interstate Commerce Act or to rules, regulations, and orders promulgated under such Act, if the interstate fares, or the ability to apply to the Interstate Commerce Commission for changes thereto, of such local public body is subject to approval or disapproval by a Governor of any State in which it provides services.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b559-11\">(B) Any local public body described in subparagraph (A) of this paragraph shall continue to be subject to applicable Federal laws pertaining to (i) safety, (ii) the representation of employees for purposes of collective bargaining, and (iii) employment, retirement, annuity, and unemployment systems or any other provision pertaining to dealings between employees and employers.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b559-12\">45 U.S.C. \u00a7 744(j)(1) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b559-13\">The words in 1(A), \u201cExcept as provided in subparagraph (B) of this paragraph\u201d were deleted when Congress reenacted these paragraphs as the present \u00a7 10504. The historical revision notes to the present \u00a7 10504 indicate that these words were omitted \u201cas unnecessary because the Commission does not have jurisdiction over safety, collective bargaining, and employee <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>benefit matters, <em>and those matters are covered by other provisions of title 49 related to the Secretary of Transporta</em>tion.\u201d 49 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 10504 (1986 Supp.). While NJT concedes that the jurisdiction of the Interstate Commerce Commission and its rates are not applicable to it because of the express provision of \u00a7 10504(b)(2), which exempts carriers from ICC jurisdiction where the governor of the state approves the carrier\u2019s fares, it nevertheless claims that because \u00a7 10504(c) refers to employment retirement, annuity, and employment systems or other provisions \u201crelated to dealings\u201d between employees and employers \u2014 matters collateral to rate regulation \u2014 it therefore also should receive all other \u201cbenefits\u201d that arise from the Commissioner\u2019s rate regulations contained in Part I. One of those benefits, NJT argues, is the overtime exemption which interstate carriers can claim. In order to reach this conclusion, NJT, as I have earlier noted, must claim to be a carrier \u201csubject to the applicable laws of the United States,\u201d and one of those applicable laws necessarily must be the rate regulation of the ICA found in Part I.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-4\">However, the revision of \u00a7 10504(c) clearly indicates that while NJT may be subject to provisions relating to employment retirement, annuity, employment systems and the like, these are matters that are <em>not </em>encompassed in the rate regulations of Part I, but rather are found elsewhere in Title 49. If therefore, NJT\u2019s theory that it need not pay overtime rates depends upon NJT being subject to the rate regulations of Part I of the ICA, it is obvious that NJT\u2019s theory is faulty because both under \u00a7 10504(b)(2) and under the 1976 amendment to the ICA it is clear that NJT\u2019s rates are <em>not </em>regulated by the Interstate Commerce Commission. Thus, any argument relying on the rate provisions of the ICA (Part I) as constituting an \u201capplicable law\u201d to which NJT is subject, is flawed, and such a contention cannot support any claimed exemption from paying overtime rates.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-6\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-7\">It defies ordinary principles of statutory construction to argue that \u00a7 10504(c), a general savings clause in one statute [The Interstate Commerce Act], should be construed as negating the effect of a specific provision [for overtime] in another statute [The Fair Labor Standards Act]. Sutherland, <em>Statutory Construction </em>at 47.08 (4th Ed. Sands, 1972) (where there is doubt concerning the extent of the application of a proviso on the scope of another statute\u2019s operation, the proviso must be strictly construed). More specifically, it is awkward, if not contradictory, to conclude that a general clause [49 U.S.C. \u00a7 10504] which in essence narrows the scope of NJT\u2019s <em>privilege </em>(immunity from ICC fare regulation) also makes it \u201csubject to\u201d <em>yet another privilege </em>(exemption through 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 213(b)(2) from the overtime requirements of 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 207). As the district court below aptly wrote, NJT would like to interpret \u00a7 10504(c) \u201cto mean that \u2018despite (its) exemption from ICC regulation, it is still governed by laws applicable to railroad employment, including the exemption from the FLSA overtime provisions.\u2019 \u201d App. at 17. As I have shown, however, NJT\u2019s interpretation must be rejected.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-8\">The Fair Labor Standards Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 207, establishes the obligation of carriers to pay overtime rates unless the carrier is exempt by virtue of 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 213(b)(2), and this exemption can be granted only where the carrier is under ICA jurisdiction. NJT, however, is not under ICA jurisdiction. Therefore it is \u00a7 207 of the Act to which NJT properly is subject. There is no reason why NJT cannot be \u201csubject to applicable laws ... related to dealings between employees and employers,\u201d and thus subject to FLSA overtime rules, and at the same time be excluded from the FLSA overtime exemption, which applies <em>only </em>to carriers under the Commerce Commission\u2019s jurisdiction.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The fact that the ICA regula<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>tions contain a provision stating that a transit system [NJT] not covered by ICA railroad fare regulations must still comply with other, non-ICA railroad regulations, does not create contradictions or any ambiguity, as NJT has suggested. To the contrary, the legislation should be given its plain meaning, requiring all commuter rail carriers such as NJT to pay overtime if the carrier has taken advantage of not being rate regulated by the Interstate Commerce Commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-5\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-6\">Recognizing that \u00a7 10504 absolves NJT from ICA regulation, that provision nevertheless requires that NJT comply with those laws having to do with (i) safety; (ii) collective bargaining; and (iii) employment retirement, annuity, and employment systems, and other provisions. But each of these obligations springs directly from the applicable laws themselves. <em>See, e.g., </em>45 U.S.C. \u00a7 51 (common carrier liability); 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 201 <em>et seq. </em>(Fair Labor Standards Act); 45 U.S.C. \u00a7 351 (unemployment insurance requirements); and 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 3231 (railroad retirement tax requirements). Such obligations are not found in the rate regulatory scheme of Part I of the ICA, as we have pointed out.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-7\">Moreover, it adds nothing to the majority\u2019s position to argue that because each of these separate obligations originate under acts which require that the carrier be subject to ICC jurisdiction, my analysis if accepted would require that NJT no longer be subject to the safety, collective bargaining and employment provisions of \u00a7 10504(c)(3). The short answer to that argument is that \u00a7 10504(c)(3) by its <em>specific </em>terms requires that NJT be subject to the terms of the Railroad Labor Act, Railroad Retirement Act, and Federal Employer\u2019s Liability Act. <em>See </em>Dis. Op., at 457, <em>supra. </em>Section 10504(c)(3), however, does not by its terms provide that NJT shall have the \u00a7 213(b)(2) exemption enjoyed by rail carriers under ICC jurisdiction. Thus, the argument made in the majority\u2019s opinion (see maj. op., at 455, n. 2) falls of its own weight when the text of the relevant statute, \u00a7 10504(c)(3), is examined and given its plain meaning.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-9\">NJT suggests that if the district court\u2019s interpretation, with which I agree, is correct, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 213(b)(2) would \u201cappear to be the only statute which is generally applicable to relationships between railroad employees and employers which would not be applicable to NJ Transit ... [and] these other laws have substantial negative financial and operational impacts on NJ Transit, costing NJ Transit more than twenty million dollars annually and amounting to seventeen percent of its labor costs.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Brief at 22. This calculation of costs, of course, means little without a corresponding calculation of benefits. In particular, it ignores the benefit of freedom from federal fare regulation that NJT now enjoys. More importantly, NJT wrongly implies that this interpretation of \u00a7 10504(c), rather than the applicable laws themselves, creates the negative financial burden under which NJT claims to suffer. Under the legislative scheme reflected by 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 10504(c), I see nothing unfair in requiring NJT to satisfy its required obligations under the various statutes, including the FLSA. My analysis does no more than refuse to permit NJT to have its cake (be free from ICA rate regulation) and eat it, too (be exempt from overtime payments).</p>\n<p id=\"b561-10\">VI.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-11\">For these reasons, I would affirm the judgment of the district court. Because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>the majority rules otherwise, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b557-11\">. NJT would have us read \u00a7 10504(c) to the effect that it, NJT, is subject to the exemption statute, \u00a7 213(b)(2), by virtue of \u00a7 10504(b)(3)\u2019s \"other provisions related to dealings between employees and employers.\u201d Not only does such a construction strain the plain meaning of the statute, but from the standpoint of sheer grammatical construction, the phrasing of \u00a7 10504(c) in terms of \"subject to,\u201d is awkward and is obviously not intended to reach the result for which NJT contends.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b560-5\">. The majority suggests, maj. op., at 453, that the ruling of the court below depended upon a narrow reading of the word \"dealings\u201d in the last clause of \u00a7 10504(c). This is not the case. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>Judge Debevoise based his opinion on an expansive view of \u00a7 10504, and concluded that the language used in \u00a7 10504(c)(3) was meant to refer to broad statutory schemes such as FLSA as a whole. He explored the meaning of \"dealings\u201d only as an implausible alternative. App. at 16. Like Judge Debevoise, I do not believe that the grammatical awkwardness of \u00a7 10504(c) justifies concentrating on the single phrase \"dealings with employees,\u201d at the expense of the other terms of the statute. App. at 41. Even if \"dealings\" is taken in the sense that the majority urges however, NJT would still not have been bound by the ICA, because it was not an \"applicable law\u201d. <em>See supra, </em>dis. op., at 458-59.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
