(California Aviation) sued the City of Santa Monica (City), alleging that the City engaged in unlawful price fixing and unfair competition in the execution of a lease with California Aviation at Santa Monica Municipal Airport. The district court granted the City\u2019s motion for summary judgment on three alternative grounds: (1) that the state antitrust immunity doctrine exempted the City from federal antitrust liability; (2) that the challenged lease was neither unlawful <em>per se </em>nor un<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"907\">*907</page-number>lawful under the rule of reason; and (3) that California Aviation\u2019s complete involvement in the formation of the challenged lease barred it from attacking the lease. California Aviation appeals from the district court\u2019s entry of summary judgment. We agree with the first ground relied upon by the district court, that the state action immunity doctrine exempts the City from federal antitrust liability. We therefore affirm without ruling upon the second and third alternative grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b991-5\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b991-6\">In 1966, California Aviation and the City entered into a thirty-year lease at Santa Monica Municipal Airport. The lease authorized California Aviation to sell fuel and other petroleum products and to rent hangar and tie-down facilities at the airport. The lease also provided that California Aviation could charge no less for petroleum products than the City charged. California Aviation contends that this lease provision violates the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1-7 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b991-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b991-8\">Under the state action immunity doctrine first articulated in <em>Parker v. Brown, </em>317 U.S. 341, 63 S.Ct. 307, 87 L.Ed. 315 (1943), anticompetitive activity by the states is outside the scope of the federal antitrust laws. Anticompetitive activity by a municipality is likewise exempt from federal antitrust liability when the municipality acts pursuant to a clearly articulated and affirmatively expressed state policy to displace competition with regulation. <em>Lorrie\u2019s Travel &amp; Tours, Inc. v. SFO Airporter, Inc., </em>753 F.2d 790, 792 (9th Cir.1985). To establish that the state\u2019s policy is clearly articulated and affirmatively expressed, the City must show that there is a state policy to displace competition and that the legislature contemplated the kind of municipal actions alleged to be anticompetitive. <em>Lorrie\u2019s Travel &amp; Tours, Inc. v. SFO Airporter, Inc., Id. </em>at 792; <em>Golden State Transit Corp. v. City of Los Angeles, </em>726 F.2d 1430,1433 (9th Cir.1984), <em>cert. denied, </em>471 U.S. 1003, 105 S.Ct. 1865, 85 L.Ed.2d 159 (1985). We have consistently assumed that a state legislature contemplated a municipal restraint on competition if the restraint was a necessary or reasonable consequence of engaging in anticompetitive activity authorized by the legislature. <em>Lorrie\u2019s Travel &amp; Tours, Inc. v. SFO Airporter, Inc., Id. </em>at 793; <em>Springs Ambulance Service, Inc. v. City of Rancho Mirage, </em>745 F.2d 1270, 1273 (9th Cir.1984).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b991-13\">California Aviation contends that the state action immunity doctrine does not exempt the City from antitrust liability in this case because no state statute clearly articulates and affirmatively expresses a state policy of allowing municipalities to fix the minimum price of fuel at airports. We agree, however, with the district court that the State of California has enacted a comprehensive statutory scheme that articulates a state policy to displace competition at municipal airports. <em>See </em>Cal.Pub.Util. Code \u00a7\u00a7 21690.5-21690.10 (West Supp. 1986); Cal.Gov\u2019t.Code \u00a7\u00a7 50470 and 50474 (West 1983); Cal.Penal Code \u00a7 602.4 (West Supp.1986);<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>see also Lorrie\u2019s Travel &amp; </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"908\">*908</page-number><em>Tours, Inc. v. SFO Airporter, Inc., Id. </em>at 793. We also agree with the district court that the state legislature contemplated the kind of municipal activity at issue in this case. The California legislature expressly stated that it \u201ccontemplates that publicly owned or operated airports will grant exclusive or limited agreements in furtherance of the policy of this state to displace business competition....\u201d Cal.Pub.Util. Code \u00a7 21690.8 (West Supp.1986). The price restrictions in California Aviation\u2019s lease with the City are a limited agreement to displace competition with regulation in the provision of certain aviation services, and they are clearly a reasonable consequence of engaging in the authorized activity of limiting business competition at municipal airports. <em>Lorrie\u2019s Travel &amp; Tours, Inc. v. SFO Airporter, Inc., Id. </em>at 793. We therefore hold that the challenged provisions in the City\u2019s lease with California Aviation were executed pursuant to a clearly articulated and affirmatively expressed policy to displace competition with regulation, and that they are exempt from scrutiny under the federal antitrust laws.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b992-6\">California Aviation argues, however, that the California statutes governing airport facilities should not be interpreted to express a state policy of displacing competition with regulation because such an interpretation would bring the state statutes into conflict with federal law. We disagree. Federal Aviation Administration regulations found at 14 C.F.R. \u00a7 151.121 (1986) state in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b992-7\">The sponsor\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b992-10\">(b) Agrees that ... it will not, either directly or indirectly, grant or permit any person, firm or corporation the <em>exclusive right </em>at the airport ... to conduct any aeronautical activities, including ... sale of aviation petroleum products____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b992-12\">14 C.F.R. \u00a7 151.121 (1986) (emphasis added). California Aviation contends that 14 C.F.R. \u00a7 151.121 would preempt California state law if state law were interpreted to authorize anticompetitive agreements at municipal airports, and that such an interpretation therefore cannot stand. Yet 14 C.F.R. \u00a7 151.121 forbids only agreements that grant exclusive rights to conduct aeronautical activities, and the challenged provisions in California Aviation\u2019s lease with the City do not grant any such exclusive right. Section 3.06 of the lease is explicit on this point:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b992-13\">Developer shall have the <em>non-exclusive </em>right to sell petroleum products to those persons whose planes are stored in hangars or tied down on the airport, or to those persons operating transient aircraft on the Airport, (emphasis added)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AIj\">There is accordingly no conflict between state and federal law in this case, and no need to interpret the state statute in light of a threat of federal preemption.</p>\n<p id=\"b992-14\">California Aviation likewise argues that the Emergency Petroleum Allocation Act (Petroleum Act), 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 751-760 (1982) would preempt section 21690.8 if the latter provision were construed to authorize agreements restricting the price of petroleum products at municipal airports. Again, we disagree. The Petroleum Act granted the President \u201cspecific temporary authority to deal with shortages of crude oil, residual fuel oil, and refined petroleum <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"909\">*909</page-number>products or dislocations in their national distribution system.\u201d 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 751(b) (1982). We see no evidence that Congress intended to occupy entirely the field of petroleum price regulation, and California Aviation does not suggest that the price restrictions authorized by section 21690.8 led to prices that exceeded federal guidelines. Again, there is no need to interpret the state statute in light of a threat of federal preemption, because there is no conflict between state and federal law in the present case.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b993-5\">California Aviation makes two additional arguments against the application of the state action immunity doctrine in this case. First, it notes that Cal.Pub.Util.Code \u00a7\u00a7 21690.5-21690.10 were enacted in 1982, and it contends that those statutes cannot confer retroactive immunity upon a lease that was signed in 1966. We disagree. Sections 21690.5-21690.10 were intended to articulate and affirm a pre-existing state policy of allowing municipalities to enter into anticompetitive agreements at public airports. This legislative intent is evident in the last sentence of section 21690.5:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b993-11\">Therefore, since the proper operation of the state\u2019s publicly owned or operated airports is essential to the welfare of the state and its people, the Legislature <em>recognizes and affirms </em>such operation as a governmental function to be discharged in furtherance of the policy of securing the benefits of commerce and tourism for the state and its people.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AfpH\">Cal.Pub.Util.Code \u00a7 21690.5 (WestSupp. 1986) (emphasis added).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b993-12\">Finally, California Aviation argues that \u00a7\u00a7 21690.5-21690.10 cannot exempt the City from antitrust liability because the City has failed to \u201cdetermine the necessity\u201d of the anticompetitive agreement, as required by section 21690.9.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> We disagree. The lease itself indicates that the City determined that its airport policies were necessary,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and section 21690.9 requires no hearings or findings of fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b993-13\">Because we hold that the state antitrust immunity doctrine protects the City from liability in this case, we do not consider whether the challenged lease would be unlawful <em>per se </em>or unlawful under the rule of reason. We also do not consider whether <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"910\">*910</page-number>California Aviation\u2019s involvement in the formation of the lease would bar it from attacking the lease.</p>\n<p id=\"b994-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b991-9\">. The Supreme Court recently affirmed a dismissal under the state action immunity doctrine because the allegedly anticompetitive municipal conduct \u2018logically would result from\u201d conduct authorized by the state legislature. <em>Town of Halie </em>v. <em>City of Eau Claire, </em>471 U.S. 34, 105 S.Ct. 1713, 1718, 85 L.Ed.2d 24, 31 (1985).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b991-10\">.

In other state antitrust immunity cases, this court has found that statutes enacted after allegedly anticompetitive conduct expressed pre-existing state policies to displace competition. <em>See Mercy-Peninsula Ambulance v.
