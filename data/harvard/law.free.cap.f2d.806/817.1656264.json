The plaintiff, Theodore J. Loeffler, complained that he had been fired because of his sex. He has prevailed on the merits. The question presented is whether prejudgment interest can be awarded as an element of the relief. We hold that it cannot be.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-10\">This issue first came before us in <em>Cross v. United States Postal Service, </em>733 F.2d 1327 (8th Cir.1984). There, a panel of this Court held, with Judge Arnold dissenting, that sovereign immunity bars an award of prejudgment interest in actions against the Postal Service under Title VII. Thereafter, rehearing en banc was granted, thus vacating the panel opinion. On rehearing, the judges of this Court were evenly divided. 733 F.2d 1332 (8th Cir.1984), <em>cert. denied, </em>470 U.S. 1051, 105 S.Ct. 1750, 84 L.Ed.2d 815 (1985). As a result, the judgment of the District Court in Cross\u2019s case, holding prejudgment interest unavailable, was affirmed, but our decision had no precedential effect. The issue was left open for future determination in someone else\u2019s case, either by another panel or by the Court en banc. Decisions by an equally divided court decide only the particular case. They have <em>res judicata, </em>but not <em>stare decisis, </em>effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-12\">The issue next came before a panel in the present case. The panel held, as the <em>Cross </em>panel had, that prejudgment interest could nor be awarded. <em>Loeffler v. Carlin, </em>780 F.2d 1365 (8th Cir.1985). The Court again granted rehearing en banc. On rehearing, we find the reasoning of the <em>Cross </em>panel persuasive, and we adopt the substance of the opinion of that panel.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b902-13\">Our conclusion is strongly reinforced by the recent decision of the Supreme Court in <em>Library of Congress v. Shaw, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 106 S.Ct. 2957, 92 L.Ed.2d 250 (1986), holding that Congress, in enacting Title VII, did not waive the Government\u2019s immunity from interest. The reasoning of <em>Shaw </em>is quite instructive. The Court\u2019s opinion, written by Justice Blackmun, forcefully expresses the long-established rule that absent <em>express </em>congressional consent, interest cannot be awarded against the Government.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b902-16\">In the absence of express congressional consent to the award of interest separate from a general waiver of immunity to suit, the United States is immune from an interest award. This requirement of a separate waiver reflects the historical view that interest is an element of damages separate from damages on the substantive claim.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b902-17\"><em>Id. </em>at 2961. The Court emphasizes \u201cthe rule that interest cannot be recovered unless the award of interest was affirmatively and separately contemplated by Congress.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2962. Rejecting Shaw\u2019s argument that Congress waived the Government\u2019s immunity from interest in Title VII actions by making the United States liable \u201cthe same as a private person\u201d for \u201ccosts,\u201d including \u201ca reasonable attorney\u2019s fee,\u201d 42 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"819\">*819</page-number>U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-5(k), the Court noted that \u201cwe must construe waivers strictly in favor of the sovereign and not enlarge the waiver \u2018beyond what the language requires.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2963. The Court further noted that \u201c[t]he no-interest rule provides an added gloss of strictness upon these usual rules.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b903-5\">In addition, the Court specifically disagreed with Shaw\u2019s claim that Congress, by equating the liability of the United States with that of a private party, waived the Government\u2019s immunity from interest. The Court reasoned as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b903-6\">It was not until 1972 that Congress waived the Government\u2019s immunity under Title VII as a defendant, affording federal employees a right of action against the Government for its discriminatory acts as an employer. See \u00a7 717, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-16(d). That \u00a7 706(k) already contained language equating the liability of the United States [as a plaintiff] for attorney\u2019s fees to that of a private person does not represent the requisite affirmative congressional choice to waive the no-interest rule____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b903-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 2964.</p>\n<p id=\"b903-9\">The reasoning of the Court in <em>Shaw </em>is fully applicable to the present case. In the Postal Reorganization Act of 1970, Congress provided that the Postal Service may \u201csue and be sued in its official name.\u201d 39 U.S.C. \u00a7 401(1). That act, however, did not authorize Title VII actions against the Postal Service. Instead, such authorization did not come until 1972, when Congress amended Title VII and extended it for the first time to the Postal Service and other federal entities. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-16. As <em>Shaw </em>establishes, this extension of Title VII to the federal sector did not waive the immunity of these federal entities with respect to interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b903-10\">Nor does the sue-and-be-sued clause of the Postal Reorganization Act provide congressional authorization for awarding interest in Title VII actions against the Postal Service. In the first place, for reasons discussed in the panel opinion in <em>Cross, </em>we are convinced that Congress did not intend to place postal employees in a better position than all other federal employees with respect to interest in Title VII cases. <em>See Cross, </em>733 F.2d at 1330. Moreover, we believe the case is governed by a fundamental principle: that a sue-and-be-sued clause does not expand the obligations of a federal entity in a suit brought pursuant to another statute that is itself a waiver of immunity and which constitutes an exclusive remedy. Loeffler\u2019s action was not brought under the sue-and-be-sued clause of the Postal Reorganization Act. Instead it was brought under Title VII as amended in 1972. As required by Title VII, the defendant in Loeffler\u2019s action is the Postmaster General, not the Postal Service in its official name. There can be no doubt that the 1972 amendments to Title VII created \u201can exclusive, pre-emptive administrative and judicial scheme for the redress of federal employment discrimination.\u201d <em>Brown v. General Services Administration, </em>425 U.S. 820, 829, 96 S.Ct. 1961, 1966, 48 L.Ed.2d 402 (1976). Thus it is apparent that the sue-and-be-sued clause of the Postal Reorganization Act has no bearing upon the present case, and that the scope of Loeffler\u2019s remedy must be determined by reference to Title VII, just as in the case of any other federal agency.</p>\n<p id=\"b903-12\">It is noteworthy that in both <em>Federal Housing Administration v. Burr, </em>309 U.S. 242, 60 S.Ct. 488, 84 L.Ed. 724 (1940), and <em>Franchise Tax Board v. United States Postal Service, </em>467 U.S. 512, 104 S.Ct. 2549, 81 L.Ed.2d 446 (1984), sue-and-be-sued clauses are discussed in terms of amenability to process. On the other hand, interest is an aspect of damages. Thus, interest is relevant to remedy rather than to amenability to process. <em>See Shaw, </em>106 S.Ct. 2957. Yet in the present case, the sue-and-be-sued clause does not even make the Postal Service amenable to process. Instead, the Postal Service is amenable to process in a Title VII case only under the federal sector provisions of Title VII. It follows that the scope of Loeffler\u2019s remedy must be determined by reference to the federal sector provisions of Title VII, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"820\">*820</page-number>not by reference to the sue-and-be-sued clause of the Postal Reorganization Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-4\">The foregoing discussion exposes the fundamental flaw in the reasoning of <em>Nagy v. United States Postal Service, </em>773 F.2d 1190 (11th Cir.1985), holding the Postal Service liable for interest on a Title VII back pay award. In <em>Nagy, </em>the court starts with the premise that the Postal Reorganization Act presumptively waived the Postal Service\u2019s immunity for <em>all purposes, </em>including Title VII. That premise, however, is completely invalid, because in enacting the Postal Reorganization Act Congress specifically rejected the idea of making the Postal Service liable under Title VII as a private employer. <em>See Cross, </em>733 F.2d at 1330. Until Congress some two years after passing the Postal Reorganization Act amended Title VII to extend it to the federal sector with additional provisions applicable only to that sector, there had been no congressional waiver, presumptive or otherwise, of the Postal Service\u2019s immunity to Title VII actions. Thus, with all respect, we cannot agree that the <em>Nagy </em>opinion reached a correct result.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b904-5\">The situation in the present case is closely analogous to that in cases arising under the Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA), 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1346(b), 2671-2680. As this Court held in <em>Peak v. Small Business Administration, </em>660 F.2d 375, 377 (8th Cir.1981), the FTCA is the exclusive remedy in tort actions against the Government, and this is so despite the statutory authority of any federal agency \u201cto sue and be sued in its own name.\u201d <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2679(a). Accordingly, tort actions against the Postal Service may not proceed under the sue-and-be-sued clause as if the Postal Service were a private company, but must proceed under the FTCA with all of that Act's limitations on its waiver of sovereign immunity. <em>See Insurance Co. of North America v. United States Postal Service, </em>675 F.2d 756 (5th Cir.1982) (per curiam); <em>Contemporary Mission, Inc. v. United States Postal Service, </em>648 F.2d 97, 104-05 n. 9 (2d Cir.1981); <em>Sportique Fashions, Inc. v. Sullivan, </em>597 F.2d 664, 665-66 n. 2 (9th Cir.1979). Congress made the Postal Service subject to the FTCA, and therefore in a tort action the Postal Service is treated like any other federal agency.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-8\">Similarly, Congress has made the Postal Service subject to the federal sector provisions of Title VII. Like the FTCA, Title VII as extended by Congress to the federal sector constitutes a limited waiver of sovereign immunity and a comprehensive, exclusive remedy for the kinds of injuries that are within its purview. It follows that in a Title VII action, the Postal Service must be treated like any other federal agency. And as the Supreme Court has made clear in <em>Shaw, </em>federal agencies sued under Title VII are not subject to interest awards, since Congress has not waived the Government\u2019s sovereign immunity to interest awards in such actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-9\">In footnote 5 of the <em>Shaw </em>opinion, the Court stated that the requirement of an express waiver of sovereign immunity as to interest is \u201cinapplicable where the Government has cast off the cloak of sovereignty and assumed the status of a private commercial enterprise. <em>See, e.g., Standard Oil Co. v. United States, </em>267 U.S. 76, 79 [45 S.Ct. 211, 212, 69 L.Ed. 519] (1925).\u201d 106 S.Ct. at 2963 n. 5. In a supplemental filing, Loeffler relies on this footnote and argues that the effect of the sue-and-be-sued clause of the Postal Reorganization Act is to remove the cloak of immunity from the Postal Service by conferring upon it the status of a private enterprise. This reliance on footnote 5 of the <em>Shaw </em>opinion is misplaced, however, for the simple reason that Congress never has conferred upon the Postal Service the status of a private enterprise for purposes of Title VII actions. To the contrary, Congress explicitly treated the Postal Service as a federal agency when it amended Title VII in 1972 to make the Postal Service and other federal agen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"821\">*821</page-number>cies amenable to suit under Title VII. This stands in sharp contrast to the sue-and-be-sued clause, which never has authorized Title VII actions against the Postal Service. Instead, as previously noted, Title VII actions against the Postal Service and other federal agencies can be brought only in accordance with the explicit and detailed federal sector provisions of Title VII. Congress provided for attorneys\u2019 fees and costs in such actions, but did not provide for interest, and we may presume that it made this choice with full awareness of the traditional rule that interest does not lie on awards against the Government absent an express provision to the contrary. In any event, because of the manner in which Congress extended Title VII to the Postal Service it is abundantly clear that for purposes of Title VII Congress has chosen to treat the Postal Service as a federal agency, not as a private enterprise.</p>\n<p id=\"b905-5\">Moreover, Loeffler\u2019s private enterprise argument fails because it is clear the Postal Service\u2019s legal relationship with its employees is predominantly that of a federal agency, not that of an ordinary business. For example, Postal Service employees are appointed under the postal career service, which is part of the federal civil service. 39 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001(b). Further, under 39 U.S.C. \u00a7 1005, Postal Service employees specifically are subject to a number of other protective provisions applicable to all federal employees. As the panel opinion in <em>Cross </em>points out, the Postal Reorganization Act and its legislative history conclusively establish that under that Act postal employees are to be treated in exactly the same way as other federal employees for equal employment opportunity purposes. 733 F.2d at 1330. It is, therefore, apparent that Congress has not relegated the Postal Service to private enterprise status insofar as many of the rights and remedies of its employees vis-a-vis the Service are concerned. It is also apparent that Congress did not intend to place postal employees in a better position than all other federal employees with respect to interest in Title VII cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b905-6\">Finally, we do not believe that <em>Franchise Tax Board </em>supports Loeffler\u2019s position. In holding that the sue-and-be-sued clause of the Postal Reorganization Act rendered the Postal Service amenable to administrative process requiring it to withhold delinquent state income taxes from the wages of postal employees, the Supreme Court observed \u201cthat waiver of sovereign immunity is accomplished not by \u2018a ritualistic formula\u2019; rather intent to waive immunity and the scope of such a waiver can only be ascertained by reference to underlying congressional policy.\u201d 467 U.S. at 521, 104 S.Ct. at 2554 (citation omitted). When we examine congressional policy applicable to the present case, it becomes apparent that (1) the Postal Reorganization Act did not waive the immunity of the Postal Service from liability under Title VII; (2) the subsequent amendments of Title VII that extended it to the Postal Service and other federal sector defendants do not provide for interest on Title VII judgments against these defendants. In short, reference to congressional policy leads inexorably to the conclusion that Congress has not waived the immunity of the Postal Service from interest on Title VII awards.</p>\n<p id=\"b905-7\">The judgment of the District Court denying prejudgment interest on Loeffler\u2019s Title VII award is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b905-8\">It is so ordered.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b904-6\">. The other post-Cross court of appeals decision awarding interest against the Postal Service in an employment discrimination case, <em>Hall v. Bol-ger, </em>768 F.2d 1148 (9th Cir.1985), is not a Title VII case and therefore is not in point.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b905-9\">ARNOLD, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"Apxt\">with whom LAY, Chief Judge, HEANEY, McMILLI-AN, and JOHN R. GIBSON, Circuit Judges join, dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b905-10\">Today the Court holds that prejudgment interest can never be awarded to prevailing plaintiffs in Title VII actions against the United States Postal Service. It thus creates a square conflict with <em>Nagy v. United States Postal Service, </em>773 F.2d 1190 (11th Cir.1985), the only other appellate opinion directly in point.</p>\n<p id=\"b905-11\">For the reasons given in my dissenting opinion in <em>Cross, supra, </em>733 F.2d at 1330,1 respectfully dissent. I add a few words to address briefly certain <em>post-Cross </em>develop<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"822\">*822</page-number>ments that fortify the conclusion I reached there.</p>\n<p id=\"b906-4\">The Eleventh Circuit has now held that the barrier of sovereign immunity was \u201cdeliberately lifted by Congress when it created the Postal Service,\u201d and that prejudgment interest on back-pay awards is therefore available. <em>Nagy v. United States Postal Service, supra. Cf. Hall v. Bolger, </em>768 F.2d 1148 (9th Cir.1985) (post-judgment interest on award of attorneys\u2019 fees against Postal Service under 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 791, forbidding discrimination by reason of handicap, not barred by sovereign immunity). <em>But cf. Frazier v. United States Postal Service, </em>790 F.2d 873 (Fed.Cir.1986) (per curiam) (Merit Systems Protection Board has no authority to award interest on back-pay award). Moreover, a recent decision of the Supreme Court explicitly states \u201cwe must presume that the [Postal] Service\u2019s liability is the same as that of any other business.\u201d <em>Franchise Tax Board of Cal. v. United States Postal Service, </em>467 U.S. 512, 104 S.Ct. 2549, 2553, 81 L.Ed.2d 446 (1984) (sovereign immunity no bar to state agency\u2019s order commanding Postal Service to withhold delinquent taxes from employees\u2019 wages).</p>\n<p id=\"b906-5\"><em>Library of Congress v. Shaw, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 106 S.Ct. 2957, 92 L.Ed.2d 250 (1986), a case decided after the oral argument in this case, is emphasized in Judge Bowman\u2019s well-argued opinion for the Court en banc. <em>Shaw </em>holds that sovereign immunity bars an award of prejudgment interest in Title VII cases against agencies of the federal government. If the Postal Service were an agency of the federal government in the same sense as the Library of Congress, <em>Shaw </em>would be in point, and I would be constrained to adopt the view taken by the Court. But the Postal Service is not a federal agency in this simple, unqualified sense. Since 1970 it has had' a special status. \u201cCongress ... indicated [in the Postal Reorganization Act of 1970] that it wished the Postal Service to be run more like a business than had its predecessor, the Post Office Department.\u201d <em>Franchise Tax Board of Cal. v. United States Postal Service, supra, </em>104 S.Ct. at 2553-54 (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b906-9\">As the Court recognizes, <em>ante </em>p. 7, the <em>Shaw </em>opinion contains a qualification. It states that \u201c[t]he no-interest rule is ... inapplicable where the Government has cast off the cloak of sovereignty and assumed the status of a private commercial enterprise.\u201d 106 S.Ct. at 2963 n. 5. Has the Postal Service assumed the status of the sort of \u201cprivate commercial enterprise\u201d the Supreme Court had in mind? Obviously there are respects, and important ones, in which the Postal Service is unlike a private employer. But I do not believe that sovereign immunity with regard to an ordinary incident of relief in a civil action is one of those differences. The Supreme Court in <em>Franchise Tax Board, </em>a unanimous opinion decided just two years before <em>Shaw, </em>and not referred to at all by the <em>Shaw </em>court, specifically stated that sue- and-be-sued clauses are to be liberally construed <em>and </em>that \u201cwe must presume that the [Postal] Service\u2019s liability is the same as that of any other business.\u201d 104 S.Ct. at 2554. It seems, then, that the Court considers the Postal Service to be like a private commercial enterprise for purposes of sovereign immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b906-10\">Our Court\u2019s position comes down to this: when the Postal Reorganization Act was passed in 1970, creating the Postal Service and subjecting it to a sue-and-be-sued clause, sovereign immunity was waived, but not so far as Title VII was concerned, because at that time Title VII did not apply to any federal instrumentality, including the Postal Service. Later, when Title VII did come into the federal-government-employment picture, nothing was said in so many words about interest. Therefore immunity remains in effect to bar interest awards. I cannot claim that the Supreme Court\u2019s <em>Franchise Tax Board </em>opinion conclusively rejects that position. But I do think that the opinion is more naturally read to support my view. In addition to the arguments already advanced, I call attention especially to another statement in <em>Franchise Tax Board. </em>After stating that \u201c[t]he nearly universal conclusion of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"823\">*823</page-number>lower federal courts has been that the Postal Beorganization Act constitutes a waiver of sovereign immunity,\u201d 104 S.Ct. at 2553 n. 12, the Court cites a number of opinions with approval. One of them, see <em>id. </em>at 2554 n. 12, is <em>Milner v. Bolger, </em>546 F.Supp. 375 (E.D.Cal.1982). <em>Milner </em>squarely holds that the general no-interest rule applicable to federal agencies sued under Title VII does not apply to the Postal Service. The inclusion of <em>Milner </em>in a string citation in a footnote is of course not the equivalent of an unequivocal Supreme Court pronouncement. But it does lend additional support to my position.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-5\">For these reasons, I would hold that an award of prejudgment interest against the Postal Service under Title VII is not barred by sovereign immunity.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
