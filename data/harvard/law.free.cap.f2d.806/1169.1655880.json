This case requires us to determine, <em>inter alia, </em>whether the district court abused its discretion in sentencing these defendants to the maximum prison terms provided by the applicable statutes, whether these sentences resulted from impermissible bias on the part of the district judge, and whether consecutive sentences properly may be imposed for possession of explosives in violation of 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 5861(d) (1982) and for the carrying of explosives during the commission of a felony under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 844(h)(2) (1982). The American Civil Liberties Union of New Jersey, the National Lawyers Guild \u2014 New Jersey Chapter, the Center for Constitutional Rights and the National Emergency Civil Liberties Committee, concerned that the defendants\u2019 sentences may be related to their political beliefs, have submitted a brief to this court on the issue as amici curiae.</p>\n<p id=\"b1255-5\">The district court\u2019s jurisdiction stemmed from 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3231 (1982); we have appellate jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 (1982). For the following reasons, we will affirm the judgments and sentences in all respects.</p>\n<p id=\"b1255-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1255-7\">Defendants do not challenge the government\u2019s evidence. This evidence showed that on November 3, 1984, Susan Rosenberg rented a storage bin at a public storage facility in Cherry Hill, New Jersey. Identifying herself to the facility\u2019s manager with a New York driver\u2019s license issued in the name of \u201cBarbara Grodin,\u201d Rosenberg provided several telephone numbers at which she could be reached, paid for the storage bin in cash, and received an entrance code number which would provide access to the facility. Rosenberg did not unload anything into the bin at that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b1255-8\">Several days later, when the manager was not in the office, an employee rented out the bin that had been assigned to \u201cBarbara Grodin\u201d to another party. When the manager returned to the office, he requested the new party to remove his belongings from the bin. The new renter refused, however, and the manager reassigned \u201cBarbara Grodin\u201d to another storage bin and attempted to contact her to inform her that both her bin and her entrance code had been changed to reflect the reassignment. When the manager was unable to contact her using the phone numbers she had supplied, he wrote a letter to \u201cBarbara Gro-din\u201d and sent it to the address listed on the driver\u2019s license Rosenberg had given him. Soon thereafter he received a phone call from the real Barbara Grodin who informed the manager that she had not rented a storage bin. Moreover, Ms. Grodin wrote the manager that her wallet, containing her driver\u2019s license, had been stolen. The manager suggested that Grodin contact the Cherry Hill police concerning the matter, which she did. After a number of phone conversations between Grodin, the manager, and the Cherry Hill police, the parties agreed that if Rosenberg returned to the storage facility the manager would contact the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b1255-10\">On November 29, 1984, Rosenberg and Timothy Blunk drove up to the facility in a car towing a rented trailer. Unable to enter with the old access code, Rosenberg knocked on the office\u2019s window to request admission. The manager recognized Rosenberg as the woman who had identified herself as Barbara Grodin. The manager directed Rosenberg to a new storage bin, provided her with a new access code, and returned to the office to phone the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b1255-11\">Officer Di Francisco responded to the call. After speaking with the manager, Di Francisco proceeded to the storage area where he observed the defendants covering certain items on the floor of the bin with opaque plastic. Di Francisco noted that one of the items appeared to be an ammunition box and that another item, a large tubular object, bore the clearly visible label \u201cblasting agent.\u201d Di Francisco also observed that both Rosenberg and Blunk were wearing glasses and wigs. Di Fran<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1172\">*1172</page-number>cisco asked the defendants for identification, and both produced New York driver\u2019s licenses. Rosenberg\u2019s identified her as Barbara Grodin, and Blunk\u2019s was issued in the name of William Hammond. When Rosenberg was unable to provide Di Francisco with the correct birthdate on her license, she volunteered to retrieve additional identification from her car.</p>\n<p id=\"b1256-4\">Di Francisco did not permit her to return to the car, but instead led the two outside the bin where they met with Officer Martin who had just arrived. Di Francisco told Martin to stay with Blunk while he and Rosenberg returned to the manager\u2019s office. At the office, Di Francisco called headquarters, confirmed that the license was stolen, and again asked Rosenberg for her birthdate. She gave him a date that was different from the one she had earlier given him, as well as different from the one on the license. At this point, the officer arrested Rosenberg and placed her in the rear seat of his car, drove back to the storage area, arrested Blunk, and placed him in Officer Martin\u2019s car.</p>\n<p id=\"b1256-5\">Di Francisco then proceeded to defendants\u2019 car in an effort to locate the additional identification that Rosenberg mentioned. On the front seat of the defendants\u2019 car, Di Francisco found two purses each containing a fully loaded semi-automatic pistol with additional ammunition clips.</p>\n<p id=\"b1256-6\">After obtaining a search warrant, the police searched the bin, discovering a stockpile of ammunition, weapons, explosives, and false identification documents. In particular, the bin contained twelve assorted guns, two of which \u2014 an Uzi 9mm. semi-automatic rifle and an Ithaca twelve-gauge shotgun with its barrel \u201csawed-off\u201d \u2014 were required to be registered to defendants in the National Firearms Registration and Transfer Record under 26 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 5861(d); nearly two hundred sticks of dynamite, more than one hundred sticks of DuPont Trovex, a high explosive, a wide array of blasting agents, blasting caps, batteries and switches; and hundreds of false identification documents, including various drivers\u2019 licenses, social security cards, and FBI and DEA identification badges.</p>\n<p id=\"b1256-9\">On December 6, 1984, a federal grand jury returned an indictment charging Blunk and Rosenberg with conspiracy, firearms offenses, and possession of false identification documents. Trial commenced on March 7, 1985. From the beginning of the proceedings, it was evident that Blunk and Rosenberg styled themselves as \u201cpolitical prisoners\u201d rather than criminal defendants. They insisted on being absent from most of the trial proceedings and directed their retained counsel to remain inactive during the trial. To accommodate them, the trial judge provided Blunk and Rosenberg with closed circuit television through which they could monitor the proceedings, and appointed a public defender to remain in the courtroom for the trial to protect the defendants\u2019 interests. Both defendants made opening statements to the jury in which they asserted that their conduct was justified by reference to \u201ca higher body of laws.\u201d On March 17, 1985, the jury returned a verdict of guilty on all submitted counts. The court imposed the maximum prison sentence on each count and ordered that each sentence run consecutively.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1173\">*1173</page-number>defendants\u2019 statements at sentencing indicated that their only regret was that they had not been successful.</p>\n<p id=\"b1257-5\">Blunk and Rosenberg timely filed this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1257-6\">II. SENTENCING ISSUES</p>\n<p id=\"A4UP\">A. <em>Length of Sentence</em></p>\n<p id=\"A0-\">Appellants argue that the district court abused its discretion in imposing the maximum term of imprisonment provided by statute. Our standard of review over this claim is limited. It is well settled that absent procedural defects, an appellate court will not disturb the district court\u2019s sentence if it falls within the statutory limits. <em>See Gardner v. Florida, </em>430 U.S. 349, 357, 97 S.Ct. 1197, 1204, 51 L.Ed.2d 393 (1977); <em>United States v. Tucker, </em>404 U.S. 443, 447, 92 S.Ct. 589, 591, 30 L.Ed.2d 592 (1972); <em>United States v. Matthews, </em>773 F.2d 48, 52 (3d Cir.1985); <em>United States v. Felder, </em>744 F.2d 18, 20 (3d Cir.1984); <em>United States v. Del Piano, </em>593 F.2d 539, 540 (3d Cir.) (per curiam), <em>cert. denied, </em>442 U.S. 944, 99 S.Ct. 2889, 61 L.Ed.2d 315 (1979). Blunk and Rosenberg invite us to find the required procedural defects in the trial court\u2019s alleged anticommunist statements and remarks concerning defendants\u2019 parole eligibility. For the reasons set out in our discussion of the defendants\u2019 bias claims, we conclude that the record does not support their contention.'</p>\n<p id=\"ahm-dedup-0\">B. <em>Bias</em></p>\n<p id=\"Asky\">Appellants also argue that their sentences resulted from the district judge\u2019s bias or prejudice against them, and therefore that we should vacate their sentences and remand the matter for resentencing before a different judge. The proper procedure for disqualification for bias or prejudice is governed by 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 144 (1982).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> For the purpose of this statute, the alleged bias or prejudice must stem from an extrajudicial source rather than from facts which the judge has learned from his participation in the case. <em>See United States v. Grinnell Corp., </em>384 U.S. 563, 583, 86 S.Ct. 1698, 1710, 16 L.Ed.2d 778 (1966); <em>Beverly Hills Bancorp, </em>752 F.2d 1334, 1341 (9th Cir.1984). Recusal motions pursuant to this statute must be timely filed, contain a good faith certificate of counsel, and include an affidavit stating material facts with particularity which, if true, would lead a reasonable person to the conclusion that the district judge harbored a special bias or prejudice towards defendants. <em>See generally United States v. Thompson, </em>483 F.2d 527 (3d Cir.1973). No such motion was here made.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1258-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1174\">*1174</page-number>There is also a rarely invoked exception to \u00a7 144\u2019s statutory procedure that requires disqualification when a judge displays \u201cpervasive bias\u201d towards defendants regardless of the source of the bias. <em>See Three Mile Island Alert, Inc., 771 </em>F.2d 720, 739 (3d Cir.1985), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 106 S.Ct. 1460, 89 L.Ed.2d 717 (1986); <em>United States v. Meester, </em>762 F.2d 867, 885 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 106 S.Ct. 579, 88 L.Ed.2d 562 (1985); <em>Davis v. Board of School Commissioners, </em>517 F.2d 1044, 1051 (5th Cir.1975), <em>cert. denied, </em>425 U.S. 944, 96 S.Ct. 1685, 48 L.Ed.2d 188 (1976). Appellants argue that the district court\u2019s adverse decisions concerning bail and security, the court\u2019s antagonistic attitude toward defense counsel, its remarks concerning communism, and its letter to the Bureau of Prisons recommending against parole for defendants evidence such bias.</p>\n<p id=\"b1258-8\">We do not believe that these allegations prove any bias against Blunk and Rosenberg, much less the pervasive bias necessary to disqualify the judge at this juncture. Adverse decisions alone do not support a finding of bias. <em>See Meester, </em>762 F.2d at 885; <em>International Business Machines Corp., </em>618 F.2d 923, 929-30 (2d Cir.1980); <em>Botts v. United States, </em>413 F.2d 41, 44 (9th Cir.1969). The court\u2019s trial orders seem to us reasonable, and lacking in any indicia of bias. We are unable to discern in the record evidence of the alleged antagonism on the part of the court toward either of the defense attorneys.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> As for the alleged bias against communism, the defendants cite the judge\u2019s comments during sentencing that \u201c[t]he only advice I give you is that you read what an earlier generation of revolutionaries who have embraced Communism have written. \u2018The God that Failed.\u2019 Read what Arthur Koestler and other disillusioned ex-Communists have written. It may help you.\u201d This statement, by itself does not suggest a bias against Blunk and Rosenberg. In the context of the sentencing minutes, the remark is addressed to the defendants\u2019 lack of remorse for their conduct and declared intention to continue these activities once released. As such, the remark is directed toward the defendants\u2019 chances for a successful rehabilitation, a proper concern of the trial court. <em>See United States v. Grayson, </em>438 U.S. 41, 47-48, 98 S.Ct. 2610, 2614, 57 L.Ed.2d 582 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b1258-12\">Finally, appellants urge that the district judge\u2019s letter to the Bureau of Prisons recommending against parole for these defendants after ten years of imprisonment, a possibility provided by 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4205(a) (1982),<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> demonstrates bias towards them. We disagree. In this letter, the district judge reiterated his statement during sentencing that \u201cit will be a terrible mistake if these defendants were to be released from prison after serving only 10 years if their attitude then is as it is now.\u201d As the letter itself indicates, the court drew this conclu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1175\">*1175</page-number>sion from the facts presented at trial together with his observation of the defendants\u2019 lack of remorse at sentencing. No charge of bias can be assigned to the court\u2019s recommendation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1259-5\">In sum, in the context of this case, the district court\u2019s actions do not provide a basis for the operation of the pervasive bias exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b1259-6\">C. <em>Proportionality</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1259-7\">Blunk and Rosenberg maintain that the district court\u2019s sentence of fifty-eight years for each defendant violates the eighth amendment\u2019s guarantee against cruel and unusual punishment.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Appellants rely on the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Solem v. Helm, </em>463 U.S. 277, 103 S.Ct. 3001, 77 L.Ed.2d 637 (1983) which held that a life sentence without the possibility of parole for the crime of uttering a \u201cno account\u201d cheek imposed under South Dakota\u2019s recidivist statute violated the eighth amendment.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1259-8\">Appellants have not directed us to, nor have our own efforts uncovered, a federal case which has reversed a lower court\u2019s imposition of consecutive sentences under the eighth amendment. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Golomb, </em>754 F.2d 86, 90 (2d Cir.1985) (collecting cases). Although the <em>Solem </em>Court admonished that \u201cno penalty is <em>per se </em>constitutional,\u201d 463 U.S. at 290, 103 5. Ct. at 3009, the Court also cautioned that our scope of review for this claim is extremely limited, for \u201c[o]utside the context of capital punishment, <em>successful </em>challenges to the proportionality of particular sentences [will be] exceedingly rare.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 289-90, 103 S.Ct. at 3009, <em>quoting Rummel v. Estelle, </em>445 U.S. 263, 272, 100 S.Ct. 1133, 1138, 63 L.Ed.2d 382 (1980) (emphasis added by the <em>Solem </em>Court); <em>see Hutto v. Davis, </em>454 U.S. 370, 374, 102 S.Ct. 703, 705, 70 L.Ed.2d 556 (1982); <em>Government of the Virgin Islands v. Ramos, </em>730 F.2d 96, 98 (3d Cir.1984); <em>cf. United States v. Darby, </em>744 F.2d 1508, 1525 (11th Cir.1984), <em>cert. denied, </em>471 U.S. 1100, 105 S.Ct. 2322, 85 L.Ed.2d 841 (1985) (scope of review \u201cgreatly restricted\u201d). The <em>Solem </em>Court explained that appellate courts \u201cshould grant substantial deference to the broad authority that legislatures necessarily possess in determining the types and limits of punishments for crimes, as well as to the discretion that trial courts possess in sentencing convicted criminals.\u201d 463 U.S. at 290, 103 S.Ct. at 3009. This principle of substantial deference in turn restrains us from an extended analysis of proportionality save in rare cases. <em>Id. </em>at 290 n. 16, 103 S.Ct. at 3009 n. 16.</p>\n<p id=\"b1259-13\">We agree with the Fourth and Fifth Circuits that apart from <em>Solem\u2019s </em>particular factual context \u2014 a life sentence without the possibility of parole \u2014 an abbreviated proportionality review following the <em>Solem </em>guidelines satisfies eighth amendment demands. <em>See United States v. Rhodes, </em>779 F.2d 1019, 1028 (4th Cir.1985), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 106 S.Ct. 2916, 91 L.Ed.2d 545 (1986); <em>Moreno v. Estelle, </em>717 F.2d 171, 180 n. 10 (5th Cir.1983), <em>cert. denied, </em>466 U.S. 975, 104 S.Ct. 2353, 80 L.Ed.2d 826 (1984). These factors include: (i) a consideration of the gravity of the offense and the harshness of the penalty; (ii) the sentences imposed on criminals in the same jurisdiction; and (iii) the sentences imposed for the same crime in other jurisdictions. <em>Solem, </em>463 U.S. at 292, 103 S.Ct. at 3010. Because defendants\u2019 crimes are federal and lack clear state analogues, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1176\">*1176</page-number>our determination rests on the first two factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b1260-4\">In analyzing the first factor, we look to \u201cthe harm caused or threatened to the victim or society, and the culpability of the offender.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 292, 103 S.Ct. at 3010. Blunk and Rosenberg contend that because they were convicted of \u201cpossessory\u201d offenses, the consecutive imposition of the maximum sentences for these offenses must necessarily be grossly disproportionate to their crimes. This, however, is not the test.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> We agree with the district court that the harm threatened by defendants\u2019 possession of a cache of arms and explosives combined with defendants\u2019 in court statements expressing their continued willingness to use violent methods to achieve their goals justifies the sentence. There is no doubt that this is a severe sentence; but the deference due Congress in providing for such sentences and that due the district court\u2019s finding of the magnitude of harm threatened by defendants' conduct supports our conclusion that the sentence is appropriate. <em>Cf. United States v. Kimber-lin, </em>781 F.2d 1247, 1258 (7th Cir.1985). Moreover, there can be no doubt as to the culpability of Blunk and Rosenberg. Neither denied the conspiracy and possession charges during trial. Defendants instead chose to pin their defense on the revolutionary \u201cjustification\u201d for their conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b1260-5\">With regard to the second factor, appellants have provided us with statistics designed to show that their sentences are greater than the average sentences imposed for other federal crimes and for weapons and explosives possession, and invite us to compare dissimilar crimes and sentences with theirs. Because we do not believe that this case warrants an extended eighth amendment analysis, we need not attempt to match defendants\u2019 sentences with the statistics. We hold that the sentences imposed are appropriate to the specific facts of this case and within the constitutional limits.</p>\n<p id=\"b1260-8\">III. POSSESSION OF EXPLOSIVES</p>\n<p id=\"AXBH\">A. <em>Cumulative Sentences</em></p>\n<p id=\"A33\">Blunk and Rosenberg also suggest that the court improperly pyramided their sentences by imposing consecutive sentences for Counts 2 and 5. Count 2 charged both defendants with the possession of an unregistered firearm in violation of 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 5861(d) (1982), specifically the possession of blasting caps, switches, wire, and one hundred and ninety-nine sticks of dynamite.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Count 5 charged defendants with carrying explosives during the commission of a felony in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 844(h)(2) (1982). The underlying felonies for this count were the possession of the sawed-off shotgun and the Uzi semi-automatic rifle which were the subject of Counts 3 and 4 of the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1260-9\">Courts are reluctant to impose two penalties for the same criminal conduct absent clear congressional intent otherwise, reasoning that doubts in the interpretation of criminal statutes \u201cwill be resolved against turning a single transaction into multiple offenses.\u201d <em>Bell v. United States, </em>349 U.S. 81, 84, 75 S.Ct. 620, 622, 99 L.Ed. 905 (1955). Thus, in <em>United States v. Gomez, </em>593 F.2d 210 (3d Cir.) (in banc), <em>cert. denied, </em>441 U.S. 948, 99 S.Ct. 2172, 60 L.Ed.2d 1052 (1979), we held that consecutive sentences could not be imposed under the Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act for possession of a controlled substance with the intent to distribute and for the actual distribution when the convictions stemmed from the same transaction. In so doing, we observed that consecutive sentences in that case would undermine the Act\u2019s detailed penalty scheme and violate \u201cthe established rule of construction that \u2018ambiguity concerning the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1177\">*1177</page-number>ambit of criminal statutes should be resolved in favor of lenity.\u2019 \u201d <em>Gomez, </em>593 F.2d at 214, quoting <em>Simpson v. United States, </em>435 U.S. 6, 98 S.Ct. 909, 55 L.Ed.2d 70 (1978). Similarly, in <em>United States v. Gomberg, </em>715 F.2d 843 (3d Cir.1983), <em>cert. denied </em>465 U.S. 1078, 104 S.Ct. 1440, 79 L.Ed.2d 760 (1984), we determined that cumulative sentences for a continuing criminal enterprise pursuant to 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 848 (1982) and the substantive offenses comprising the enterprise could not be imposed under the Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act because the structure of the penalties in the Act showed that Congress intended section 848 to operate exclusively for sentencing purposes. <em>Gom-berg, </em>715 F.2d at 851.</p>\n<p id=\"b1261-5\">We find neither an ambiguity nor evidence of congressional intent prohibiting cumulative sentences in the instant case. Instead, we find that the language and legislative history of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 844(h)(2) clearly authorize the sentences here. The legislative history for this provision indicates that Congress intended to extend the \u201cstringent provisions\u201d of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c) (1982), a nearly identical statute that provides for increased punishment for felons who carry or use a gun during the commission of a felony, to the area of explosives. <em>See </em>H.Rep. No. 1549, 91st Cong., 2d Sess., <em>reprinted in </em>1970 U.S.Cong. &amp; Ad.News 4007, 4046. Section 924(c) provides for enhanced sentences unless the underlying substantive offense was one that already provided for enhanced punishment where the felony was committed with a dangerous weapon. <em>See Busic v. United States, </em>446 U.S. 398, 403, 100 S.Ct. 1747, 1751, 64 L.Ed.2d 381 (1980) (assault with a firearm); <em>Simpson, </em>435 U.S. at 13 (bank robbery with a dangerous weapon). The Supreme Court\u2019s interpretation in these two cases rests in part on statements by the Act\u2019s sponsor that \u00a7 924(c) would not extend to the particular offense in question. See <em>Busic, </em>446 U.S. at 406, 100 S.Ct. at 1752; <em>Simpson, </em>435 U.S. at 13, 98 S.Ct. at 913. Congress neither provided for enhanced penalties in the underlying offense for carrying an explosive device while possessing an unregistered firearm, nor expressed an intention in the legislative history that \u00a7 844(h)(2)\u2019s scope would not extend to such felonies. We therefore hold the consecutive sentences to be proper.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1261-8\">B. <em>Lack of Relational Element</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1261-9\">Appellants maintain that their conviction on Count 5, for carrying explosives during the commission of a felony (possession of firearms), must be reversed. Appellants contend reversal is justified because no specific connection was shown between the carrying of the explosives and the felony. Because this issue implicates the interpretation and application of a statute, our review is plenary. <em>Universal Minerals, </em>699 F.2d at 101-02.</p>\n<p id=\"b1261-10\">The basis for Count 5, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 844(h)(2), prohibits the \u201ccarr[ying of] an explosive unlawfully during the commission of any felony which may be prosecuted in a court of the United States....\u201d No court has explicitly decided whether the statute requires the government to prove a connection between the explosive and the underlying felony. Cases involving \u00a7 844(h)(2) indicate varying results. <em>See United States v. Lopez, </em>586 F.2d 978, 979 (2d Cir.1978) (per curiam) (felony was assault and no indication explosives were connected to assault), <em>cert. denied, </em>440 U.S. 923, 99 S.Ct. 1251, 59 L.Ed.2d 476 (1979); <em>United States v. Tiche, </em>424 F.Supp. 996, 1000 (W.D.Pa.) (in general discussion of statute, court stated \u201cAll that is required is that the explosives were used in the commission of a felony....\u201d), <em>aff\u2019d mem., </em>564 F.2d 90 (3d Cir.1977); <em>United States v. Pliskow, </em>354 F.Supp. 369, 370 (E.D.Mich.) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1178\">*1178</page-number>(defendant apparently used explosives in an attempted aircraft hijacking), <em>aff\u2019d mem., </em>480 F.2d 927 (6th Cir.1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b1262-4\">The legislative history of \u00a7 844(h) is similarly unilluminating. The section was part of Title XI of the Organized Crime Control Act of 1970. The impetus for Title XI was the recurring bombs and bomb threats during that period. Congress stated that: \u201cThe absence of any effective State or local controls clearly attest to the urgent need to enact strengthened Federal regulation of explosives.\u201d H.R. No. 1549, 91st Cong., 2d Sess., <em>reprinted in </em>1970 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News 4007, 4013. Title XI also was intended to strengthen federal criminal law with respect to the illegal use, transportation, or possession of explosives. <em>Id. </em>at 4011. Section 844(h) itself \u201ccarries over to the explosives area the stringent provisions of the Gun Control Act of 1968 relating to the use of firearms and the unlawful carrying of firearms to commit, or during the commission of a Federal felony.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 4046.</p>\n<p id=\"b1262-5\">Both sides rely on cases interpreting the Gun Control Act provision. Prior to its amendment, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c) prohibited carrying a firearm during the commission of a felony. As amended (now \u00a7 924(c)),<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> the statute now prohibits carrying a firearm <em>during and in relation to </em>the commission of a felony.</p>\n<p id=\"b1262-6\">In <em>United States v. Stewart, </em>779 F.2d 538 (9th Cir.1985), relied on by appellants, the court required a specific connection between the firearm and the underlying felony. The basis for the court\u2019s decision was that the legislative history to the 1984 amendment \u201cstrongly implie[d]\u201d that the \u201cin relation to\u201d phrase did not affect the scope of the statute as originally written. <em>Id. </em>at 539-40. The court decided that the amending Congress recognized that the earlier Congress had intended to require such a relation. <em>Id. </em>at 540. The second case advanced by appellants, <em>United States v. Robertson, </em>706 F.2d 253 (8th Cir.1983), is inapposite. The court reversed the conviction, not because the government failed to prove a connection between the firearm and the felony, but because the proof did not establish that the defendant was even carrying a gun on his person.</p>\n<p id=\"b1262-13\">We find that the <em>Stewart </em>court\u2019s analysis of \u00a7 924(c) is not helpful to our analysis of \u00a7 844(h)(2). First, we do not find that the legislative history to the 1984 amendment \u201cstrongly implied\u201d that the \u201cin relation to\u201d language did not affect the scope of the statute as originally drafted. At most, we find that the legislative history fails to explain why the \u201cin relation to\u201d phrase was added to the statute. <em>See </em>S.Rep. No. 225, 98th Cong., 2d Sess. 312-14, <em>reprinted in </em>1984 U.S.Cong. &amp; Ad.News 3182, 3490-92. Second, even if the <em>Stewart </em>court was correct in its analysis of why Congress amended \u00a7 924(c), Congress has not seen fit to modify \u00a7 844(h) in the same manner. Thus, even if Congress\u2019s subsequent pronouncements clarify previously enacted statutes, Congress\u2019s decision to amend \u00a7 924(c), but not \u00a7 844(h), is, at best, open to a multiplicity of interpretations.</p>\n<p id=\"b1262-14\">Finding the legislative history to the 1984 amendment in this state, we return to the plain language of \u00a7 844(h). Section 844(h)(2) by its terms only requires that the government show that the defendant unlawfully carried an explosive \u201cduring the commission of any felony.\u201d The plain <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1179\">*1179</page-number>everyday meaning of \u201cduring\u201d is \u201cat the same time\u201d or \u201cat a point in the course cf.\u201d <em>See, </em>Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary 703 (1961). It does not normally mean \u201cat the same time and in connection with____\u201d It is not fitting for this court to declare that the crime defined by \u00a7 844(h)(2) has more elements than those enumerated on the face of the statute. If Congress sees fit to add a relational element to \u00a7 844(h)(2), it is certainly free to do so, in the same manner that it added a relational element to \u00a7 924(c). Until such time, we will hold that \u00a7 844(h)(2) has no relational element, and accordingly, we now hold that the district court correctly denied the defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss Count 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b1263-7\">IV. FIRST AMENDMENT ISSUE</p>\n<p id=\"adu-dedup-1\">Amici urge that we vacate defendants\u2019 sentences and remand for resentencing on the grounds that the sentences resulted from the trial court\u2019s adverse reaction to the defendants\u2019 statements advocating revolutionary social change. According to am-ici, the trial court imposed its sentences \u201cat least partly\u201d in retaliation for the defendants\u2019 political philosophy.</p>\n<p id=\"b1263-8\">We agree with the courts that have considered the issue that the imposition of a sentence on the basis of a defendant\u2019s beliefs would violate the first amendment\u2019s guarantees. <em>See United States v. Lemon, </em>723 F.2d 922, 937 (D.C.Cir.1983); <em>United States v. Bangert, </em>645 F.2d 1297, 1308 (8th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>454 U.S. 860, 102 S.Ct. 314, 70 L.Ed.2d 158 (1981); <em>cf. Bordenkircher v. Hayes, </em>434 U.S. 357, 363, 98 S.Ct. 663, 667, 54 L.Ed.2d 604 (1978). A trial judge may consider a wide range of factors in fashioning a sentence to fit the crime and the individual defendant, however. <em>See United States v. Tucker, </em>404 U.S. 443, 446, 92 S.Ct. 589, 591, 30 L.Ed.2d 592 (1972); <em>United States v. Baylin, </em>696 F.2d 1030, 1038-39 (3d Cir.1982); 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3577 (1982).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Specifically, the sentencing judge properly may consider the defendant\u2019s amenability to rehabilitation and expressions of remorse for the crime committed when the judge selects an appropriate sentence. <em>See United States v. Grayson, </em>438 U.S. 41, 47-48, 98 S.Ct. 2610, 2614, 57 L.Ed.2d 582 (1978); <em>Bangert, </em>645 F.2d at 1308-09.</p>\n<p id=\"b1263-13\">Although trial courts are not required to articulate their reasons for a particular sentence in this circuit, <em>see United States v. Montoya, </em>612 F.2d 792, 793 (3d Cir.1980); <em>United States v. Del Piano, </em>593 F.2d at 540, the district court, recognizing the value of the practice for appellate review, placed its reasons on the record.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The court specifically admonished the defendants that it was not imposing its sentence on the basis of their political views or remarks, stating,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1263-14\">[l]et me make this clear. You are not on trial here because of your beliefs and your statements. Unlike the Soviet Union, whose political faith you embrace as Communists, here you can believe and say what you want to. Your distorted rhetoric about this being a political trial is best described as \u201chogwash.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1263-15\">The court then proceeded to give its reasons for the sentences:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1263-16\">You purportedly think because you adhere to certain beliefs and political views you can, when the time comes, as you see it, unleash guns, ammunition, and explosives to kill and destroy. You can\u2019t. If all you did was denounce this country you\u2019d be free. Under your philosophy here you could murder anyone you selected and do it with impunity, because you decided it was necessary to advance your Communist cause. You had two guns on the front seat of that car, to kill. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1180\">*1180</page-number>In the trailer you had 600 plus pounds of explosives and dynamite, to kill and destroy. You carried a silhouette target of a man to practice your killing. You had books to aid you in using your arms____ In short, you are a present danger to the community, you show no remorse, all you promise with your conduct at this trial is that if and when released you\u2019ll kill the first time you perceive it to be justified.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ap8D\">The court\u2019s comments clearly show that the sentences it selected are based on its assessment of defendants\u2019 lack of remorse and potential for rehabilitation. We find that the record, and in particular, the sentencing minutes, do not justify amici\u2019s concern that the court imposed the sentences as a punishment for the defendants\u2019 exercise of their first amendment rights. <em>Cf. Bangert, </em>645 F.2d at 1308 (trial court stated that its sentence was unrelated to defendants\u2019 political beliefs and placed proper reasons on the record).</p>\n<p id=\"b1264-6\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b1264-7\">Having considered defendants\u2019 contentions, and finding each without merit, we will affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1256-7\">. On Count 1, which charged both defendants with conspiracy to possess unregistered firearms and false documents in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 371 (1982), the court imposed a five year sentence. On Count 2, which charged defendants with possession of unregistered firearms (the explosives) in violation of 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 5861(d), defendants received ten years. On Count 3, which charged defendants with the possession of unregistered firearms (the sawed-off shotgun), defendants received ten years. For Count 4, which charged defendants with the possession of unregistered firearms (the Uzi semi-automatic rifle), defendants received ten years. For Count 5, which charged defendants with the carrying of explosives during the commission of a felony in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 844(h)(2), defendants received ten years. On Count 6, which charged defendants with the possession with intent to use false identification documents in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1028 (Supp. II 1984), they received three years. On Count 7, which charged Rosenberg with falsely representing a social security account number with the intent to deceive in violation of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 408(g)(2) (1982), she received five years. On Count 8, which charged Blunk with falsely representing a social security account <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1173\">*1173</page-number>number with the intent to deceive, he received 5 years. For Count 9, which charged both defendants with the possession of counterfit social security cards in violation of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 408(g)(3) (1982), defendants received five years.</p>\n<p id=\"Ag3\">The court imposed the sentences to run consecutively for a total prison term of fifty-eight years for each defendant. Although many of the offenses also provided for monetary penalties, the court declined to include fines in the defendants' sentences.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1257-9\">. This section provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1257-10\">Whenever a party to any proceeding in a district court makes and files a timely and sufficient affidavit that the judge before whom the matter is pending has a personal bias or prejudice either against him or in favor of any adverse party, such judge shall proceed no further therein, but another judge shall be assigned to hear such proceeding. The affidavit shall state the facts and the reasons for the belief that bias or prejudice exists, and shall be filed not less than ten days before the beginning of the term at which the proceeding is to be heard, or good cause shall be shown for the failure to file it within such time.

A disqualification motion filed after trial and judgment is usually considered untimely unless good cause can be shown for the delay, for otherwise a party alleging bias would always await judgment in the hopes of a favorable decision. <em>See Crowder v.

Even assuming appellant's brief to this court could constitute a motion for the purposes of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 144, it must be denied as untimely, and as lacking the substantive requirements of legal sufficiency. <em>See Thompson, </em>483 F.2d at 528.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1258-9\">. We are unpersuaded by appellants\u2019 suggestion that the court\u2019s comment concerning the connection between Rosenberg and her attorney, Susan Tipograph, in the court\u2019s post-sentence letter to the Bureau of Prisons demonstrates the alleged antagonism. In the letter, the court stressed the importance of ensuring a secure confinement for the defendants:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1258-10\">As to the place of incarceration, it will be remembered that Rosenberg\u2019s \"comrade\u201d, Marilyn Buck, was permitted to walk out of Alderson on a legal furlough to visit her attorney, Tipograph. Tipograph and Rosenberg are more than just attorney and client. They have been associates, companions, and roommates. I am sure the Bureau of Prisons will make certain that Rosenberg does not profit from the same mistake that was made as to Buck. Careful consideration must be given to the security of any prison to which Rosenberg \u00eds sent. She is under indictment in the Southern District of New York, charged with aiding in the prison escape of Joanne Chesimard. I cannot emphasize too much the fact that a minimum-security prison will not hold Rosenberg.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1258-13\">In context, the remark shows only the court\u2019s concern that the Bureau of Prisons be aware of the possibility that Rosenberg might attempt to escape.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1258-14\">. This section provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1258-15\">Whenever confined and serving a definite term or terms of more than one year, a prisoner shall be eligible for release on parole after serving one-third of such term or terms or after serving ten years of a life sentence or of a sentence of over thirty years, except to the extent otherwise provided by law.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b1259-10\">.

Three years prior to <em>Solem, </em>the Court held that a life sentence imposed on a defendant under Texas\u2019s recidivist statute for a conviction of obtaining $120.75 by false pretenses did not offend the eighth amendment\u2019s cruel and unusual punishment clause. <em>Rummel v.

LEON HIGGINBOTHAM, Jr., Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"a0q-dedup-0\">dissenting in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b1264-9\">Although I join the majority in rejecting the aggregate sentencing, eighth amendment and first amendment claims raised by appellants Rosenberg and Blunk, I respectfully dissent from its treatment of appellants\u2019 convictions and sentences on Counts 2 and 5 for illegally possessing explosives. Because the majority has disregarded central principles of statutory construction in upholding appellants\u2019 convictions and sentences for violating 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 844(h)(2) (1982), I write separately to express my views.</p>\n<p id=\"b1264-11\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1264-12\">In Count 5 of the indictment, appellants Blunk and Rosenberg were charged with violating \u00a7 844(h)(2), which makes it a felony to \u201ccarr[y] an explosive unlawfully during the commission of any [federal] felo-ny____\u201d At the close of the trial, the district court denied appellants' motion to dismiss Count 5 on the ground that the government had failed to offer any proof of a relationship between the explosives illegally possessed by the appellants and any accompanying federal felony they may have committed. The district court also refused appellants\u2019 subsequent request that the jury be charged that it had to find that \u201csome connection\u201d existed between appellants\u2019 carrying explosives and their possession of unregistered firearms \u2014 i.e., that carrying explosives \u201cplayed some role\u201d in the latter crimes \u2014 to convict them under \u00a7 844(h)(2).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> After the jury convicted appellants on Count 5, the district court sentenced each of them to a ten year sentence, the maximum term prescribed by \u00a7 844(h), such sentences to run consecutively to each appellant\u2019s other sentences. Because the trial court refused to instruct the jury as to what I find to be an essential element of this crime, appellants\u2019 convictions on Count 5 should be vacated. Accordingly, I dissent from the majority\u2019s holding. All criminal defendants, regardless of their ideology or the destructive potential of their crimes, deserve a fair reading of the applicable law.</p>\n<p id=\"b1264-14\">My analysis begins with the plain language of \u00a7 844(h)(2). Unlike the majority, I construe the statute\u2019s phrasing \u2014 its prohibition against carrying explosives unlawfully \u201cduring the commission of\u201d a federal felony \u2014 as explicitly and rather clearly connecting the possession of illegal explosives to the <em>perpetration </em>of some other feloni<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1181\">*1181</page-number>ous act.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Appellants have not asked \u201cthis court to declare that the crime defined by \u00a7 844(h)(2) has more elements than those enumerated on the face of the statute.\u201d Maj. typescript at 24. They have, rather, simply asked this court to give meaning to <em>each </em>of the words that Congress chose to use to define the elements of this crime. In my view, the majority amends a clear statute so as to eliminate an essential element of the crime that the statute expressly describes.</p>\n<p id=\"b1265-5\">Even though the legislative history of \u00a7 844(h)(2) is, as the majority notes, otherwise \u201cunilluminating,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 21, the sparse history available to us supports my reading of the statute. The House Report for what became \u00a7 844(h)(2) refers us to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(2) (1982), the gun control statute that served as a model for \u00a7 844(h),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and the legislative history of \u00a7 924(c)(2), as viewed by the Ninth Circuit in <em>United States v. Stewart, </em>779 F.2d 538 (9th Cir.1985), corroborates appellants\u2019 position. I respectfully submit that the Ninth Circuit\u2019s construction is correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b1265-6\"><em>Stewart </em>determined that \u201cthe evident purpose\u201d of the original \u00a7 924(c)(2), which is identical in structure to the current \u00a7 844(h)(2),<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> \u201cwas to impose more severe sanctions where firearms facilitated, or had the potential of facilitating, the commission of a felony.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 540. Mr. Stewart was convicted of violating \u00a7 924(c)(2) at a time when its prohibition still mirrored the language of \u00a7 844(h)(2).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Between the time of Stewart\u2019s crime and his appeal to the Ninth Circuit, however, Congress amended \u00a7 924(c)(2), replacing the word \u201cduring\u201d with the phrase \u201cduring and in relation to.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In <em>Stewart, </em>the court thus ascertained the meaning of \u00a7 924(c)(2) in light of the 1984 amendments thereto. The Ninth Circuit read the legislative history of the amendments to \u00a7 924(c) as indicating that \u201cthe \u2018in relation to\u2019 language was not intended to create an element of the crime that did not previously exist, but rather was intended to make clear a condition already implicit in the statute.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 539. Here, the majority rejects that conclusion, \u201cfindpng] that the legislative history fails to explain why the \u2018in relation to\u2019 phrase was added to the statute.\u201d Maj. at 1178. This position ignores the logical explanation offered in <em>Stewart: </em>\u201cbecause the amendment [also] eliminated the requirement that the firearm be carried unlawfully, the \u2018in relation to\u2019 language was added <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1182\">*1182</page-number>to allay explicitly the concern that a person could be prosecuted under section 924(c) for committing an entirely unrelated crime while in possession of a firearm.\u201d 779 F.2d at 539. The majority has, in other words, failed to note that \u00a7 924(c) was amended in <em>two </em>interrelated ways; by disregarding one of the two amendments, the majority misconstrues what the amendment process as a whole tells us about the original intention underlying \u00a7 924(c)(2).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Stewart\u2019s reading of the legislative intent behind \u00a7 924(c)(2), and its conclusion that Congress meant to require some proof that the firearm facilitated the underlying felony, convinces me that Congress included a similar relational element in the crime defined by \u00a7 844(h)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b1266-4\"><em>United States v. Robertson, </em>706 F.2d 253 (8th Cir.1983) (per curiam), which my colleagues dismiss as \u201cinapposite,\u201d maj. at 1178, is indeed additional authority for appellants\u2019 position. While the <em>Robertson </em>decision did, as the majority observes, focus upon the meaning of the word \u201ccarries\u201d in \u00a7 924(c)(2),<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> its analysis and holding also had much to say about the statute\u2019s use of the words \u201cduring the commission of\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1266-5\">The Government produced no evidence that Robertson ever carried the weapon <em>or that the weapon played any role in Robertson\u2019s seeking collection of the unlawful debt. </em>Without some evidence showing that Robertson carried the weapon at some time <em>in connection with the commission of the offenses charged, </em>the Government\u2019s case on this count must fall.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1266-6\">706 F.2d at 256 (emphases added). As I read <em>Robertson, </em>there is simply no basis to conclude, as the majority does, that the court <em>did not </em>reverse the \u00a7 924(c)(2) conviction \u201cbecause the government failed to prove a connection between the firearm and the felony,\u201d maj. at 1178; even if the government had established that Mr. Robertson <em>was </em>carrying a gun on his person, it seems that a failure <em>also </em>to prove some connection between the firearm and felony would have moved that court to invalidate the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1266-10\">The very most one could claim, after reading the statutory language and reviewing the legislative history, is that the relational element of \u00a7 844(h)(2) is ambiguous. While I obviously dispute such a claim, even it should not defeat appellants\u2019 attacks on their Count 5 convictions.

Wiltherger, </em>18 U.S. (5 Wheal.) 76, 95, 5 L.Ed. 37 (1820). Though the majority notes the precept of lenity, <em>see </em>maj. at 1177-1178, it fails to apply the teaching of this tenet. The majority appears to reason as follows: Since \u00a7 844(h)(2) makes it a crime to carry explosives illegally in furtherance of a federal felony, it might as well make it a crime to carry explosives unlawfully even when they have nothing to do with any other federal felony one may be committing. As the majority sees things, in other words, a co\u00fcrt must ignore any ambiguity in \u00a7 844(h)(2) and read the felony it defines as broadly as possible until Congress sees fit to declare explicitly otherwise. Because this approach usurps the legislative function at the same time it abandons the judicial duty to interpret ambiguous criminal statutes with lenity, I dissent from this portion of the panel\u2019s holding.</p>\n<p id=\"b1267-11\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1267-12\">I also dissent from the majority\u2019s treatment of appellants\u2019 cumulative sentencing claims. On their convictions under Count 2, appellants each received ten year sentences for possession of explosives in violation of 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 5861(d) (1982).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> On their convictions under Count 5, appellants each received sentences of ten additional years for carrying explosives in the course of possessing firearms, a violation<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> of \u00a7 844(h)(2).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Appellants thus argue that, pursuant to their convictions under an indictment that was \u201cdesigned to maximize the number of offenses which could be charged from [a] single event,\u201d Brief for Appellants at 52, they have been impermissibly sentenced to consecutive terms for the same act: illegally possessing explosives. With his customary thoughtfulness, Judge Lacey recognized that the imposition of consecutive sentences as to Counts 2 and 5 was not without difficulty.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> I find the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1184\">*1184</page-number>resolution of this issue more difficult than has the majority.</p>\n<p id=\"b1268-4\">Analysis of this argument is guided by the well-established rule of <em>Blockburger v. United States, </em>284 U.S. 299, 52 S.Ct. 180, 76 L.Ed. 306 (1932). <em>See, e.g., Ball v. United States, </em>470 U.S. 856, 105 S.Ct. 1668, 1672, 84 L.Ed.2d 740 (1985) (The Supreme \u201cCourt has consistently relied on the <em>[Blockburger </em>] test of statutory construction\u201d). As the Second Circuit recently noted,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1268-5\">[t]he <em>Blockburger </em>rule is a principle of statutory construction used to determine whether Congress has provided that two statutory offenses may be punished separately. <em>Whalen v.

United States, </em>450 U.S. 333, 337, 101 S.Ct. 1137, 1141, 67 L.Ed.2d 275 (1981).<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The rule provides that</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ANfC\">\u2018where the same act or transaction constitutes a violation of two distinct statutory provisions, the test to be applied to determine whether there are two offenses or only one, is whether <em>each </em>provision requires proof of a fact which the other does not.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"aau-dedup-1\"><em>Blockburger, </em>284 U.S. at 304, 52 S.Ct. at 182 [emphasis added].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1268-6\"><em>United States v.

To prevent the relit-igation of this question at some later date, I would hold now as a matter of law that an accused already sentenced under \u00a7 5861(d) may not also be sentenced under \u00a7 844(h)(2) \u2014 and vice versa \u2014 for the same incident of illegally possessing the same explosives.</p>\n<p id=\"ATdt\">Because this court has affirmed appellants' convictions on both Counts 2 and 5, however, the <em>Blockburger </em>violation I find is actual, not hypothetical. In this Circuit, the remedy for such an injury is to vacate the cumulative sentences and to remand the case to the district court with instructions to impose a general sentence that does not exceed the maximum possible under the statute prescribing the greater punishment. <em>See Gov't of the Virgin Islands v. Brathwaite, </em>782 F.2d 399, 408 &amp; n. 9 (3d Cir.1986) (Hunter, J., for the court).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
