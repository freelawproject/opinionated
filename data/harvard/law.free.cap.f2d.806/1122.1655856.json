That exemption covers \u201cinter-agency or intra-agency memorandums\u201d not routinely discoverable in civil <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1123\">*1123</page-number>litigation. Its purpose is \u201cto protect the deliberative process of the government, by ensuring that persons in an advisory role [will] be able to express their opinions freely to agency decision-makers without fear of publicity.\u201d <em>Ryan v. Department of Justice, </em>617 F.2d 781, 789 (D.C.Cir.1980); <em>see also Federal Trade Commission v. Grolier Inc., </em>462 U.S. 19, 23, 103 S.Ct. 2209, 2212, 76 L.Ed.2d 387 (1983); <em>Environmental Protection Agency v. Mink, </em>410 U.S. 73, 86-87, 93 S.Ct. 827, 835-36, 35 L.Ed.2d 119 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b1207-5\">It is difficult to see how a presentence report, which is prepared for a court (not an agency under FOIA) and is fully disclosable in almost all cases under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 32(c) to the defendant and his counsel at the time of sentencing, which is later transmitted to the Bureau of Prisons and to the Parole Commission for use in classification and parole decisions, and which must again be disclosed to the prisoner before a parole hearing, <em>see </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4208(b)(2), can be said to threaten the deliberative processes of the executive branch. The sentencing court is not advising or consulting with the Parole Commission, but is simply transmitting a document which it has already disclosed to the defendant and used in making its own final decision. This case is thus clearly distinguishable from <em>Ryan v. Department of Justice. </em>There the \u201cdocuments ... were generated by an initiative from the Department of Justice, <em>i.e., </em>the questionnaire sent out by the Department to the Senators.\u201d Unlike the questionnaires in <em>Ryan, </em>the presentence reports were not \u201ccreated ... in response to an initiative from the executive branch ... as part of the deliberative process____\u201d 617 F.2d at 790. Their primary role in judicial decisionmaking has already been performed and they have already been made available to the defendants by the time the executive gets them.</p>\n<p id=\"b1207-10\">Thus, whatever chilling effect exposure may have on informants who contribute to the report<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> will already have occurred when the executive first lays eyes or hands on the report, and in any case the chill is to informants to the court, not to the executive agencies.</p>\n<p id=\"b1207-11\">As recounted in Judge Wright\u2019s dissent, the history of the Bureau\u2019s unflagging resistance to FOIA disclosure in this area is well known; for several years it argued\u2014 unsuccessfully in this court \u2014 that presentence reports were not \u201cagency records\u201d at all until the Solicitor General declined to support that argument in the Supreme Court. Now resort is had to Exemption 5 in order to block wholesale any access by prisoners under FOIA to the reports. But I fear this result may pervert both the language and the purpose of that exemption; where is the inter-agency memorandum involved and where is the executive deliberative privilege threatened? Exemptions 6 (privacy) and 7 (privacy and law enforcement) would seem to be more appropriate vehicles for taking care of any special materia] contained in presentence reports that should be protected from the prisoner\u2019s knowledge. And, contrary to Judge Silberman\u2019s assertion, Exemption 6 allows for balancing the requester\u2019s interest in access against the harm to the individual whose privacy is threatened, and so would permit an agency to grant the report to a prisoner but deny it to a curious citizen. Exemption 5 permits no such distinction. <em>See </em>Department of Justice, <em>Short Guide to the Freedom of Information Act </em>II (May 1979); J. O\u2019Reilly, <em>Federal Information Disclosure </em>\u00b6 16.07 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b1208-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1124\">*1124</page-number>I find the panel\u2019s rationale for invoking Exemption 5 almost a parody of legal formalism: a report which under statute must be disclosed in its entirety (except for a few special exemptions) to a prisoner at several points in the process can be withheld in its entirety under FOIA because it is not \u201croutinely available\u201d to a <em>third party </em>in civil discovery. Such a rationale does not just elevate form over substance; even the form of Exemption 5 must be twisted to bring presentence reports within its ambit.</p>\n<p id=\"b1208-4\">Especially in a statute like FOIA whose exemptions are to be \u201cnarrowly construed,\u201d this ruling badly needs reconsideration by the entire court.</p>\n<author id=\"b1208-5\">GINSBURG, RUTH B., Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"azm-dedup-0\">Statement on Denial of Rehearing En Banc:</p>\n<p id=\"b1208-6\">I agree that the matter addressed in Chief Judge Wald\u2019s statement is sufficiently grave to warrant consideration and decision by the full court. Accordingly, I would grant the suggested rehearing.</p>\n<author id=\"b1208-7\">SILBERMAN, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"ALRB\">Statement on Denial of Rehearing En Banc:</p>\n<p id=\"b1208-8\">Decrying legal formalism, Judge Wald paradoxically argues that presentence reports are not inter-agency memoranda because they are sent to the Parole Commission by the courts rather than by another executive branch entity. This argument\u2014 not mentioned in Judge Wright\u2019s dissent and raised by Appellees only at oral argument \u2014 would seem foreclosed by <em>Ryan v. Department of Justice, </em>617 F.2d 781 (D.C.Cir.1980), where we held that responses to Attorney General questionnaires, drafted by Senators, concerning their recommendations for judicial nominations were nonetheless inter-agency memoranda. \u201cCongress apparently did not intend \u2018inter-agency\u2019 and \u2018intra-agency\u2019 to be rigidly exclusive terms, but rather to include any agency document that is part of the deliberative process.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 790. I do not see how a principled distinction under FOIA can be drawn between reports that come to the executive branch from Congress and those that come from the judiciary.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1208-13\">Nor can it be disputed that the Parole Commission uses the presentencing report in its deliberation process much the same way confidential statements made to air crash safety investigators were used by the Air Force in <em>United States v. Weber Aircraft Corp., </em>465 U.S. 792, 104 S.Ct. 1488, 79 L.Ed.2d 814 (1984). Presentence reports are expressly intended to assist the Parole Commission\u2019s decisionmaking. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4207 (1982). <em>See also Berry v. Department of Justice, </em>733 F.2d 1343, 1351 (9th Cir.1984). That the judiciary uses the presentence report first \u2014 at the time of sentencing \u2014 in no way detracts from the undeniable fact that the Parole Commission uses them a second time in aid of its decision as to whether or not a prisoner will be eligible for parole.</p>\n<p id=\"b1208-14\">Judge Wald\u2019s position essentially is based on the proposition that Exemption 5\u2019s rationale disappears when a prisoner is shown but not given his presentence report (or at least portions of it) at the time of sentencing. Thus, she argues that \u201cwhatever chilling effect exposure may have on informants who contribute to the report has already occurred.\u201d But as the government argued before the panel, it is one thing to allow the prisoner and his counsel an opportunity to read the report and quite another to give the prisoner a copy, which then could be distributed throughout a prison or even published. We cannot know what effect that would have on those who now contribute to presentence reports. Moreover, the implication of Judge Wald\u2019s interpretation is that presentence reports would be disclosable to third parties as well, since FOIA determinations do not depend on the identity of the requester. The privacy interest of prisoners might well be threatened by such disclosures. To be sure, as Appellees pointed out, FOIA\u2019s per<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1125\">*1125</page-number>sonal privacy exemption, Exemption 6, would provide protection \u2014 if the government asserted the exemption \u2014 for presentence reports that are \u201csimilar\u201d to \u201cpersonnel and medical files,\u201d \u201cthe disclosure of which would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b)(6) (1982). <em>See, e.g., Crooker v. United States Parole Commission, </em>730 F.2d 1, 9 (1st Cir.1984). Still, Judge Wald\u2019s position, if adopted, could generate a spate of new fact-specific cases where the invasion of privacy is only arguably \u201cclearly unwarranted.\u201d</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1207-8\">. Actually, the best available research shows quite dramatically that the disclosure of presentence reports under Rule 32(c) has not affected the availability of information. \u201c[D]isclosure has been achieved without the serious repercussions predicted by opponents of the mandatory disclosure rule.\u201d Fennell and Hall, <em>Due Process at Sentencing: An Empirical and Legal Analysis of the Disclosure of Presentence Reports in Federal Courts, </em>93 Harv-L.Rev. 1613, 1689 (1980); <em>see also </em>Fed.R.Crim.P. 32 advisory committee\u2019s note (1974 amendment) (\u201cExperience ... does not lend support to the argument that disclosure will result in less complete presentence reports....\u201d); <em>Berry v. Department of Justice, </em>733 F.2d 1343, 1355 (9th Cir.1984) (\"If any chilling of sources were to occur, [the initial disclosure before sentencing] would certainly trigger it.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1208-9\">. And, X do not see how a distinction logically can depend on whether the Executive branch asks another branch for a report for use in the Executive branch\u2019s deliberations or whether, as here, a statute directs the Executive branch to use the report in its deliberations.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
