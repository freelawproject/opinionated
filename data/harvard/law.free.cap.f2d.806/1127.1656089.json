The jury found for the defendant on the ground that the defective aspects of the product at issue, a ladder, did not cause the plaintiff\u2019s injuries. The jury also found, via special verdict, that appellant made the ladder in question and that it was defective. Appellant argues that the district court should, somehow, have set aside the finding that the appellant made the ladder.</p>\n<p id=\"b1211-22\">Appellant cannot appeal the district court\u2019s failure to set aside this finding for the basic reason that appellant did not lose the case below; it won. A party cannot appeal a judgment entered in its favor, because it lacks a \u201cpersonal stake in the appeal\u201d sufficient to support appellate jurisdiction. <em>Deposit Guaranty National Bank v. Roper, </em>445 U.S. 326, 336,100 S.Ct. 1166, 1173, 63 L.Ed.2d 427 (1980); <em>see </em>9 J. Moore, <em>Federal Practice </em>\u00b6 203.06, at 3-23 (2d ed. 1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b1211-23\">Appellant argues that an exception should be made, lest the jury\u2019s finding be used against it in some future litigation. But, the short and conclusive answer to this contention is that the challenged finding has no collateral estoppel effect, for it was not essential to the favorable judgment. <em>See Raxton Corp. v. Anania Associates, Inc., </em>668 F.2d 622, 624 (1st Cir.1982); 18 C. Wright, A. Miller &amp; E.

The cases that appellant cites to the contrary involve special circumstances not present here. <em>See Deposit Guaranty</em></p>\n<p id=\"ag_-dedup-0\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1128\">*1128</page-number><em>National Bank v.
