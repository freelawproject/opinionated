William J. Campbell of the Northern District of Illinois, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b837-15\">POSNER, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b837-16\">The Labor Board asks us to enforce its order finding that Certified Grocers, a cooperative buying organization, violated section 8(a)(1) of the National Labor Relations Act, as amended, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 158(a)(1), which forbids interference with rights protected by section 7, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 157, by promulgating an overbroad rule against disclosure of employees\u2019 names, addresses, and wages. Certified argues that the Board\u2019s order is not supported by substantial evidence on the record considered as a whole.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-19\">At a time when the union was trying to organize the 100 to 200 clerical employees at three of Certified\u2019s facilities (all the rest of Certified\u2019s nonsupervisory employees were unionized), Certified\u2019s management conducted four essentially identical meetings with its clerical employees. Each employee was required to attend at least one meeting. The reasons for the multiple meetings were that there were too many employees to have a productive meeting attended by all of them and that the employees were split among different locations. At each meeting management discussed the state of the company and various company policies and closed with a request that the employees not sign union-authorization cards. After management spoke, employees were invited to ask questions. At the question-and-answer session in the first meeting (attended by about 100 employees), employee Beukema \u2014 who had already complained to Alessi, an officer of Certified, that the union had mailed campaign literature to her new address, which she hadn\u2019t wanted given out \u2014 asked how the union had gotten her address. Alessi answered that the company didn\u2019t know, that an employee\u2019s name and address are confidential, that the leak could only have come from the payroll, personnel, or data-processing departments, and that if the company discovered who was responsible for the leak it would take disciplinary action. At the three later meetings Alessi repeated Beukema\u2019s question and his answer. Finally, while testifying at a hearing (where several employees were present) on the union\u2019s petition for a representation election, Alessi answered \u201cyes\u201d to two questions by Certified\u2019s lawyer on whether it was the company\u2019s policy to keep information on wages confidential.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-20\">The union filed an unfair labor practice charge, complaining that Alessi\u2019s state<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"746\">*746</page-number>ments about confidentiality added up to the announcement of an overbroad rule that interfered with the workers\u2019 statutory right to engage in concerted activities by exchanging nonconfidential information. Later a representation election was held which the union lost by a large margin. The Board\u2019s regional director has ordered a new election; his order is at present on appeal to the Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-4\">The Board\u2019s practice, upheld in <em>NLRB v. Wyman-Gordon Co., </em>394 U.S. 759, 89 S.Ct. 1426, 22 L.Ed.2d 709 (1969), is to require the employer to disclose to the union, once a representation election is either ordered or agreed to, the names and addresses of the employees eligible to vote. But the incidents giving rise to the unfair labor practice charge in this case occurred before the election was ordered, and neither party has suggested that the Board\u2019s requirement of disclosure after the election is ordered is material to our consideration. Cf. <em>Southern &amp; Western Lumber Co., </em>212 N.L.R.B. 668, 669 n. 2 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b838-5\">The administrative law judge held that Alessi\u2019s statements \u201cwould have reasonably led the employees to believe that <em>any </em>disclosure of names, addresses, and/or wage rates, regardless of how they became aware of the information, could lead to discipline.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) Thus, even if the employee had not obtained the information from a confidential source\u2014 even if the information consisted of the employee's own name, address, or wages\u2014 the employee might (the administrative law judge thought) reasonably believe himself forbidden to disclose the information to anyone. Although the administrative law judge rejected the argument that Alessi\u2019s purpose in formulating and announcing such an overbroad \u201crule\u201d was to interfere with the union\u2019s organizing campaign, she concluded that this was the likely consequence; and since the exchange of noncon-fidential information ancillary to protected concerted activities is itself protected by section 7 of the Act, the rule, regardless of its purpose, was, she thought, an interference with rights protected by section 7, and therefore violated section 8. The Board upheld the administrative law judge\u2019s decision without opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-7\">The parties agree that a rule which merely forbids employees with access to confidential information to disclose it without the company\u2019s authorization is valid even though an incidental effect may be to make it harder for the union to organize the company\u2019s workers. See, e.g., <em>Texas Instruments, Inc. v. NLRB, </em>637 F.2d 822, 827-32 (1st Cir.1981); <em>NLRB v. Florida Steel Corp., </em>544 F.2d 896, 897 (5th Cir.1977); <em>International Business Machines Corp., </em>265 N.L.R.B. 638 (1982). The parties also agree that the company cannot go further and forbid the disclosure of nonconfidential information as well, to the detriment of the union\u2019s organizing efforts. See, e.g., <em>Bullock\u2019s, </em>247 N.L.R.B. 257, 258 (1980). If Certified had announced that an employee cannot disclose his own name, address, or wages, or the name, address, or wages of any other employee however the information about the other employee was obtained \u2014 so that if Beukema had told the two employees who were conducting the union's organizing campaign, \u201cMy name is Beukema, and I live at such-and-such address,\u201d she would have violated the rule\u2014section 8 would have been violated. See, e.g., <em>W.R. Grace Co. </em>240 N.L.R.B. 813, 815-16 (1979). Such a rule would impede the union\u2019s organizing efforts while serving no lawful interest of either the company or its employees. The issue is whether the \u201crule\u201d supposedly announced, piecemeal, by Alessi could reasonably be understood to reach so far.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-8\">We find incomprehensible the characterization of Alessi\u2019s answer to Beukema\u2019s question (an answer repeated at the three other meetings), and to the questions put by Certified\u2019s lawyer in the representation hearing, as the announcement of a rule forbidding the disclosure of nonconfidential information. This is not because a company rule or policy, to run afoul of section 8, need always be in writing; plainly it need not be. It is because context and common sense make clear that Alessi\u2019s oral <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"747\">*747</page-number>responses could not have been understood to be laying down a company policy against workers\u2019 disclosing information obtained without any breach of confidence, such as their own names. Beukema was not complaining to Alessi that the union was using information it had obtained <em>from her, </em>she was complaining because she believed that only the company had her new address and that it should not have given it to the union. When against this background Al-essi told the workers at the four meetings that the names and addresses of employees were indeed confidential, that the leak of which Beukema had complained could only have come from one of three departments in the company, and that whoever was responsible for the leak would (if caught) be disciplined, he could only have meant \u2014 and more important could only have been understood to mean \u2014 that it was against company policy for workers to disclose confidential information to which they had access by virtue of their employment in the payroll, personnel, or data-processing departments. To understand Alessi to have meant that one worker could not tell another worker his or her name would be fantastic. It is hardly surprising that no one testified to any such understanding.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-5\">The implicit premise of the Board\u2019s decision \u2014 that an answer to a question is a rule, and had better therefore dispel every possible ambiguity and incorporate every necessary qualification, lest it be considered overbroad \u2014 would make it difficult, maybe impossible, for company officials to answer questions during organizing campaigns. Every time they uttered anything about company policy, even just a one-word answer to a question from the floor, they would be deemed to have promulgated a rule, and their utterance would be scrutinized for explicit qualifications necessary to save the rule from a charge of being too broad, even if the possibility of anyone\u2019s being misled was as remote as it was here. The qualification is important. If the scope of a rule is not obvious, a loose oral statement may convey to some listeners an exaggerated impression of its scope, as in <em>Lucky Stores, Inc., </em>271 N.L.R.B. 1190, 1197 (1984). But no reasonable person (and the standard used by the Board is one of reasonableness \u2014 the Board is not seeking to protect the least alert or intelligent worker) thinks that when a company inveighs against leaks of confidential information it is telling him to conceal his name.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-7\">The Board\u2019s analysis is especially unsatisfactory with regard to Alessi\u2019s testimony, for here the \u201crule\u201d was inferred only by tacking the lawyer\u2019s questions to Alessi\u2019s essentially one-word answers. The lawyer asked, in a hearing at which two employees were present (the union\u2019s organizers), \u201cMr. Alessi, it is company policy that information with respect to pay rates is confidential?\u201d Alessi answered \u201cVes.\u201d He also answered, \u201cThat is correct,\u201d to the lawyer\u2019s question, \u201cIs my statement [correct] that an individual who reveals to an outside person the pay rates of the company, is subject to disciplinary action?\u201d By these two exchanges a rule is deemed to have been created which forbids any worker to tell another worker, not what the company\u2019s pay rates are, but what his own pay is. The Board would require Alessi, before answering, to have rephrased the lawyer\u2019s question so that the combination of question and answer would have had the precision and completeness of a published rule. We don\u2019t understand how a legal proceeding could be conducted if such a threat of liability hung over, not a lie or a misstatement, but a failure to phrase every answer as a general law. We add that the Board\u2019s theory makes Certified\u2019s lawyer complicit in the alleged violation of section 8 \u2014 an imputation for which the record provides no support.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-8\">We might still our doubts about the reasonableness of the inferences drawn by the Board \u2014 for we know that our role as a reviewing court is a distinctly limited one\u2014 if the Board, which is to say the administrative law judge, had some basis in reason or precedent for taking the unusual view that it did. But all the administrative law judge said to the point (and the Board, as we have said, added nothing to her opinion) was that the company\u2019s</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b840-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"748\">*748</page-number>threats to discipline employees who disclosed names and addresses or wage rates included no qualification to indicate to employees that they were prohibited only from giving out information from company files, as opposed to information they had of their own knowledge. Indeed, the blanket nature of the threats [to discipline whoever disclosed confidential information], and the fact that Ales-si\u2019s threats at the employee meetings as to disclosure of names and addresses were made to all the clerical employees, including those who would not have access in the normal course of their work to the information, would have reasonably led the employees to believe that <em>any </em>disclosure of names, addresses, and/or wage rates, regardless of how they became aware of the information, could lead to discipline. The cases cited above establish that such a pronouncement is unlawfully overly board____ [Emphasis in original.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b840-5\">The \u201ccases cited above,\u201d four in number, provide no support for this interpretation of Certified\u2019s \u201crule.\u201d Taking them in chronological order, <em>Ridgely Mfg. Co., </em>207 N.L.R.B. 193 (1973), enforced, 510 F.2d 185 (D.C.Cir.1975), held that the company had invoked a supposed company rule as a pretext for firing a worker because of his efforts on behalf of the union. <em>International Business Machines Corp., supra, </em>upheld a company\u2019s confidentiality rule against a challenge that it was overbroad. <em>Brigadier Industries Corp., </em>271 N.L.R.B. 656 (1984), aff\u2019d, 776 F.2d 365 (D.C.Cir.1985), upheld a company\u2019s rule against solicitations during worktime. <em>Roadway Express, Inc., </em>271 N.L.R.B. 1238 (1984), held that a company could discipline a worker for taking the company\u2019s records for union purposes, even though the company had not announced a rule against such misconduct. Only in <em>Ridgely </em>and <em>Roadway </em>had the rules not been reduced to writing. But in <em>Ridgely </em>the rule was a phoney, used just to give the company an excuse for firing union activists. And in <em>Roadway </em>the rule was self-evident (as arguably it was in the present case too); it was understood that confidential information is confidential (just as it was understood here that confidential information is confidential and nonconfidential information is nonconfidential); there was no need to announce the \u201crule\u201d orally, let alone write it down. In none of the cases was it suggested that an oral statement of policy, made in good faith, might violate section 8 because theoretically susceptible of being misinterpreted to forbid protected along with unprotected activity. The suggestion that Alessi\u2019s \u201cthreats\u201d would be misunderstood because the audience included people who did not have access to confidential information overlooks the fact that what in one sense were \u201cthreats\u201d were in another sense assurances to employees like Beukema, employees doubtless found in the audiences of all four meetings, that the company would protect the confidentiality of the information it had about them. This did not mean that the company would forbid them to tell anyone their own names.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-7\">What the Board has done here, perhaps by oversight (as suggested by its failure to write an opinion), is to take a perfectly good Board-made rule \u2014 the rule against company policies that while adopted in a good-faith effort to advance the company\u2019s lawful interests go too far and forbid conduct protected by section 7 \u2014 and apply it in a fantastic fashion, never before contemplated. We are sure the Board does not want to paralyze the efforts of company officials to respond orally to questions about company policy raised by employees or in administrative hearings. But that would be the effect of our agreeing that an \u201coverbroad\u201d answer is an \u201coverbroad\u201d rule even when nobody who heard the answer in the context of the discussion or inquiry, in which it was given would think it intended to control completely different questions. If you ask, does the company keep my medical records confidential, and the answer is \u201cyes,\u201d you could not, as a reasonable person (the administrative law judge purported, as we have said, to be ruling on the basis of a <em>reasonable </em>understanding of Alessi\u2019s statements), infer that <em>you </em>are for<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"749\">*749</page-number>bidden to disclose medical facts about yourself.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-5\">The usual purpose of confidentiality is not to maintain secrecy but to vest control over disclosure in one or a few persons \u2014 in the present case in the company, in the persons to whom the information pertains, and in those to whom these authorized disclosers voluntarily disclose it. Privacy is control, not secrecy, see, e.g., Stone, <em>The Scope of the Fourth Amendment: Privacy and the Police Use of Spies, Secret Agents and Informers, </em>1976 Am.Bar Found.Research J. 1193, 1205-11, and the purpose of the company policy to which Alessi alluded, a policy the Board found had <em>not </em>been concocted to stave off unionization, was plainly to protect the privacy of its employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-6\">Although the substantial-evidence rule that governs our review of administrative action covers inferences, as well as elementary facts of the who-did-what-to-whom variety (or, in this case, who-said-what-to-whom), and thus gives the Board broad latitude to infer the probable reaction of employees to ambiguous language directed toward them, the Board does not have <em>carte blanche </em>to impute irrationality to workers, whether directly or by describing as \u201creasonable\u201d an irrational interpretation. A worker would have to be irrational to think that when Alessi answered perfectly natural questions concerning the confidentiality of employee records he was laying down a \u201crule\u201d forbidding employees to disclose their names, addresses, and wage rates. Nothing in the context of his statements suggested any such ambition on his part or understanding on theirs, nor is there any evidence of such an understanding.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-7\">The present case is unlike such cases as <em>Jeanette Corp. v. NLRB, </em>532 F.2d 916, 919 (3d Cir.1976), where a worker was fired for violating \u201can amorphous, unwritten policy [prohibiting employees from discussing their wages with one another] apparently framed only in the minds of the company officials.\u201d See also <em>Bell Federal Savings &amp; Loan Ass\u2019n, </em>214 N.L.R.B. 75, 77-78 (1974). For a company to have secret rules, which it trundles out as pretexts for firing union \u201ctroublemakers,\u201d is a form of misconduct unrelated to the issue whether a reasonable and publicly announced policy is invalid because it might unreasonably be misunderstood to go further than necessary. Compare <em>Southern &amp; Western Lumber Co., supra, </em>212 N.L.R.B. at 669; <em>Ridgely Mfg. Co., supra, </em>207 N.L.R.B. at 196. In no previous case has the Board found, or a court upheld, a finding of an unfair labor practice in such a situation.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-9\">Enforcement of the Board\u2019s order is Denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
