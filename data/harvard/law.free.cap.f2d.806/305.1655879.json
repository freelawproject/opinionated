Nicholas appeals from a judgment of the district court dismissing his complaint against defendant William Buchanan for lack of personal jurisdiction. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-11\">In 1985, Nicholas, a citizen of Rhode Island, filed a complaint in federal district court for the district of Rhode Island against Buchanan, who Nicholas identified as the president of a Texas drilling company. Nicholas invoked the court\u2019s diversity jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332(a). In the complaint, Nicholas alleged that he had permission to arrange for the sale of drilling rigs that were in the possession of a Dallas, Texas bank. Nicholas further alleged that he contacted Buchanan at Buchanan\u2019s offices in Texas, and that he provided Buchanan with information concerning the rigs. Nicholas alleged that pursuant to an oral agreement, Buchanan agreed to provide Nicholas with a commission and/or finder\u2019s fee in the event the rigs were sold. Nicholas stated that his attorney forwarded contracts to Buchanan in Texas, but that Buchanan never returned or acknowledged those contracts. Nicholas alleged that the rigs subsequently were sold at a foreclosure sale in Texas, and that prior to the sale the purchaser of the rigs had been in contact with Buchanan. Nicholas claimed that Buchanan used the information Nicholas had provided to him to arrange for the sale of the rigs and had unlawfully deprived Nicholas of his commission and/or finder\u2019s fee.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-14\">Buchanan filed a motion to dismiss or, alternatively, a motion to quash the summons, stating that he was a citizen of Texas, that his principal place of business was in a state other than Rhode Island, that all alleged contacts between him and Nicholas occurred in Texas, and that the court therefore lacked <em>in personam </em>jurisdiction over him. Nicholas opposed the motion, stating that the alleged contacts between him and Buchanan took place \u201cinter-state via telephone communications from Rhode Island to Texas and Texas to Rhode Island, and via U.S. mail between the said two points.\u201d A magistrate subsequently recommended that the motion to dismiss be granted; the district court accepted the Magistrate\u2019s Report and Recommendation and dismissed the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-15\">The Rhode Island long-arm statute, R.I. Gen.Laws \u00a7 9-5-33 (1985 reenactment)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> al<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>lows the exercise of jurisdiction over nonresident individuals up to the constitutional limit. <em>See Almeida v. Radovsky, </em>506 A.2d 1373, 1374 (R.I.1986). In determining whether the assertion of personal jurisdiction in a given case comports with due process requirements, \u201cthe constitutional touchstone remains whether the defendant purposefully established \u2018minimum contacts\u2019 in the forum State.\u201d <em>Burger King Corp. v. Rudzewicz, </em>471 U.S. 462, 473, 105 S.Ct. 2174, 2183, 85 L.Ed.2d 528 (1985), quoting <em>International Shoe Co. v. Washington, </em>326 U.S. 310, 316, 66 S.Ct. 154,158, 90 L.Ed. 95 (1945). A defendant will be amenable to <em>in personam </em>jurisdiction if he has purposefully availed himself of the privileges and protections of a state\u2019s laws, and if his conduct and connection with the forum state are such that he should reasonably anticipate being haled into court there. <em>See World-Wide Volkswagen Corp. v. Woodson, </em>444 U.S. 286, 297, 100 S.Ct. 559, 567, 62 L.Ed.2d 490 (1980); <em>see also Escude Cruz v. Ortho Pharmaceutical Corp., </em>619 F.2d 902, 904 (1st Cir.1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b407-5\">We agree with the magistrate, whose Report and Recommendation were accepted by the district court, that Nicholas did not satisfy his burden of proving facts necessary to sustain personal jurisdiction in this case. <em>See Escude Cruz, </em>619 F.2d at 904 (plaintiff, whose complaint was dismissed for lack of personal jurisdiction, had burden of proving facts necessary to support jurisdiction). Nicholas stated in his complaint that it was he who first approached Buchanan, a Texas citizen, at Buchanan\u2019s Texas office about the rigs. The sale of the rigs, which prompted Nicholas\u2019 suit, occurred in Texas where the rigs were located. Even assuming, <em>arguendo, </em>that Nicholas and Buchanan entered into some type of oral agreement concerning the sale of the rigs, and that the agreement could be construed as a contract, an individual\u2019s contract with an out-of-state party cannot alone establish sufficient minimum contacts in the individual\u2019s home forum. <em>See Burger King, </em>471 U.S. at 477, 105 S.Ct. at 2185. Nor do we believe that Nicholas\u2019 generalized reference to inter-state contacts \u201cvia telephone communications\u201d and \u201cvia U.S. mail\u201d, without more, is sufficient to satisfy due process requirements. <em>Cf. Ealing Corp. v. Harrods, Ltd., </em>790 F.2d 978, 983-84 (1st Cir.1986) (due process requirements satisfied where defendant sent a telex to the forum state that involved an alleged fraudulent misrepresentation, there were numerous communications by telex, telephone and overnight letters back and forth between parties, defendant sent letters to plaintiff in the forum state, plaintiff had to receive approval from defendant for minutiae of the operation contemplated by an agreement between the parties, bank account in defendant\u2019s name was opened in the forum state, and defendant\u2019s agent visited the forum state); <em>Bond Leather Co., Inc. v. Q.T. Shoe Mfg. Co., Inc., </em>764 F.2d 928, 932-35 (1st Cir.1985) (defendant corporation had insufficient contacts with forum state to satisfy due process even though it had mailed four letters to forum state, had received at least one telephone call from the forum plaintiff, and had guaranteed the forum plaintiff payment for goods sold to another corporation); <em>Stuart v. Spademan, </em>772 F.2d 1185, 1193-94 (5th Cir.1985) (exchange of communications between a forum resident and a nonresident in developing a contract not sufficient to be characterized as purposeful activity invoking the benefits and protections of the forum state\u2019s laws); <em>Hydrokinetics, Inc. v. Alaska Mechanical, Inc., </em>700 F.2d 1026, 1029 (5th Cir.1983) (same); <em>Mountaire Feeds, Inc. v. Agro Impex, S.A., </em>677 F.2d 651, 656 (8th Cir.1982) (use of arteries of interstate mail, telephone, etc., is insufficient, standing alone, to satisfy due process); <em>Scullin Steel v. National Railway Utilization Corp., </em>676 F.2d 309, 314 (8th Cir.1982) (use of interstate facilities such as telephone and mail cannot alone provide <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>the minimum contacts required by due process); <em>Lakeside Bridge &amp; Steel v. Mountain State Construction, </em>597 F.2d 596, 604 (7th Cir.1979) (requirement of minimum contacts not satisfied merely because there were interstate telephone calls and written correspondence between the parties). Nicholas has not specifically alleged or identified' any other contacts between defendant and the forum state that would constitutionally permit the assertion of personal jurisdiction in this case. Accordingly, the district court\u2019s dismissal of the complaint was proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-4\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b406-12\">.
