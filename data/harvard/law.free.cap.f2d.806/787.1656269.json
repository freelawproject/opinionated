Specifically, Barker argues, <em>inter alia, </em>that the prosecution failed to prove that (1) he knew there was cocaine in a package mailed to his post office box in Little Rock, Arkansas from Lima, Peru; (2) the identity of the person who mailed the package from Lima, Peru; (3) any communications between him and any one in Peru connected with the package; and (4) he had financial capability to import seven ounces of pure cocaine. We affirm the judgment of conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b872-7\">In reviewing Barker\u2019s challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence, this court must view that evidence in the light most favorable to the government and must sustain the jury\u2019s verdict if there is substantial evidence in the record to support it. <em>Glas-ser v. United States, </em>315 U.S. 60, 80, 62 S.Ct. 457, 469, 86 L.Ed. 680 (1942); <em>United States v. Andrade, </em>788 F.2d 521, 525 (8th Cir.1986). Furthermore, the government is entitled to all reasonable inferences that may be drawn from the evidence. <em>United States v. Casperson, </em>773 F.2d 216, 221 (8th Cir.1985). \u201cThe evidence need not \u2018exclude every reasonable hypothesis except that of guilt[; it is enough] that it be sufficient to convince the jury beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant is guilty.\u2019 \u201d <em>Durns v. United States, </em>562 F.2d 542, 546 (8th Cir.) (quoting <em>United States v. Shahane, </em>517 F.2d 1173, 1177 (8th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>423 U.S. 893, 96 S.Ct. 191, 46 L.Ed.2d 124 (1975)), <em>cert. denied, </em>434 U.S. 959, 98 S.Ct. 490, 54 L.Ed.2d 319 (1977). All factual disputes are resolved in favor of the jury verdict, <em>United States v. Ellison, </em>793 F.2d 942, 949 (8th Cir.1986), and the only relevant question on appeal is whether any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>Jackson v. Virginia, </em>443 U.S. 307, 319, 99 S.Ct. 2781, 2789, 61 L.Ed.2d 560 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b872-13\">Under these standards, we state the evidence at trial. On March 13, 1985, Barker rented post office box 18245 in his name at the Southwest Post Office in Little Rock, Arkansas. The contract station is owned and operated by Mrs. Monthiray Brakebill. Mail is delivered to patrons solely through their post office boxes. From March 13, 1985, until June 5, 1986, the only piece of mail delivered to Barker\u2019s post office box was a manila package containing the cocaine at issue here.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"789\">*789</page-number>On June 5, 1985, postal inspectors delivered a package from Lima, Peru, addressed to a \u201cMr. J. Paaker, P.O. Box 18245, Little Roek, Arkansas, 72219-8245, USA.\u201d In addition to the name and address of Mr. Paaker, the package bore the following return instructions: \u201cRemite: J. Davis. A &amp; Jr Puno, 317-B, Lima 1, Perou.\u201d Several days earlier, United States customs officials intercepted the package after a dog trained in detection of drugs and narcotics indicated that it might contain drugs. In fact, the envelope held nearly seven ounces of pure cocaine, having an approximate street value of between $20,000 and $25,-000. The agents removed all of the cocaine except for a small vial and replaced it with sodium bicarbonate.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-5\">When the package ultimately arrived at the Little Rock Post Office, Mrs. Brakebill, pursuant to the postal inspector\u2019s instructions, placed a \u201cpink slip\u201d in Barker\u2019s box indicating that a package too large to fit in the box was being held for him at the front counter. Barker arrived at the post office at approximately 11:45 a.m. that morning.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> He was alone. After unlocking his post office box and finding the pink slip, he went over to the customer counter and asked Mrs. Brakebill about the piece of mail referred to on the slip. Pursuant to postal regulations, Mrs. Brakebill told Barker that a package arrived addressed to his box, but that the name listed as the addressee was misspelled. She then showed Barker the package and asked if it was his. He replied, \u201cThey can\u2019t spell. It\u2019s mine.\u201d Based on his response, Mrs. Brakebill turned the package over to Barker. He left the post office and proceeded, under surveillance, to the home of his fiance\u2019s parents. When he parked his car in the driveway, agents of the Drug Enforcement Administration approached him. The package was next to the driver\u2019s seat, unopened. Barker told the agents, when asked, that the package was not his. Despite Barker\u2019s denial, he was arrested and subsequently convicted of the charges filed against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-8\">To prove violations of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 952(a) (importing cocaine) and 843(b) (use of mail facilities to import controlled substance), the government must show that Barker knowingly or intentionally received the illegal drugs. The government may prove, through circumstantial evidence, defendant\u2019s knowledge of the illegal substance, <em>United States v. Noibi, </em>780 F.2d 1419, 1421 (8th Cir.1986), and participation in the alleged conspiracy, <em>United States v. Raymond, </em>793 F.2d 928, 932 (8th Cir.1986). Viewing the facts in a light most favorable to the government and taking all reasonable inferences therefrom, the jury could rationally have concluded that Barker\u2019s actions violated \u00a7\u00a7 952(a) and 843(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b873-9\">We affirm the judgment of conviction.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b872-8\">.

His appearance at the Post Office on the 5th of June was not his first. Several days earlier, on the 1st of June, Barker arrived at the post office in a truck with two other men. He came into the post office, opened his box and found a pink slip which Mrs. Brakebill had left for him, indicating that additional rental information was needed. At trial, Mrs. Brakebill testified that Barker removed the slip from his box and \"hastily\" went out to the truck, squatted down and spoke to the two men waiting in the vehicle. After a brief conversation, he reentered the post office and went up to the customer service counter to speak with Mrs. Brakebill. During the course of their conversation, the driver of the truck came into the post office and said \u201cWhat\u2019s going on here? What\u2019s going on in here?\u201d At the same time, the second occupant in the vehicle got out of the backseat and ran down the street. Shortly thereafter, Barker completed his conversation with Mrs. Brakebill, paid her an additional $3.00 in rental fee, and departed in the truck with the other two men.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
