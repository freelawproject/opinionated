The determination of whether to apply state or federal alter ego doctrine depends on the degree to which the subject matter of the case implicates federal interests. <em>See United States v. Kimbell Foods, Inc., </em>440 U.S. 715, 728-29, 99 S.Ct. 1448, 1458-59, 59 L.Ed.2d 711 (1979) (setting forth three-part test to determine whether courts should adopt a uniform federal rule of decision or follow state law when resolving controversies affecting the operation of federal programs). <em>Compare Laborers Clean-Up Contract Administration Trust Fund v. Uriarte Clean-Up Service, Inc., </em>736 F.2d 516, 523-25 (9th Cir.1984) (applying federal substantive law \u2014 though looking to state law for guidance \u2014 in determining whether to pierce corporate veil in case involving violations of Labor Management Relations Act and Employee Retirement Income Security Act) <em>with U-Haul International, Inc. v. Jartran, Inc., </em>793 F.2d 1034, 1043 (9th Cir.1986) (applying state alter ego doctrine in assessment of damages for Lan-ham Act violations). State law governs the determination of whether there exists an alter ego from whom the government may satisfy the obligation of a taxpayer. <em>See Aquilino v. United States, </em>363 U.S. 509, 512-13, 80 S.Ct. 1277, 1279-80, 4 L.Ed.2d 1365 (1960); <em>Terrapin Leasing, Ltd. v.
