His estate brought suit against Farrell Lines alleging that Farrell was negligent under the Jones Act, and that Farrell\u2019s vessel, the <em>Austral Pioneer, </em>was unsea-worthy under general maritime law. At trial, the jury returned a verdict for defendant. Larkins\u2019 estate now makes various assignments of error pertaining primarily to the district court\u2019s jury instructions. We do not find these persuasive, and we therefore affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-24\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-25\">Walter Larkins\u2019 duties on the <em>Austral Pioneer </em>consisted of cleaning and maintaining the officers\u2019 quarters. Sometime during the night of June 13, 1982, Larkins disappeared from the vessel which was then en route to New Zealand. He was last seen at about 8 p.m. in his room and was reported missing the next morning at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>8:30 a.m. when he failed to appear for his duties. During the night the seas were rough, and the ship\u2019s captain ordered the crew to clear the deck as a safety measure. After a search of the ship and the surrounding waters, Larkins was presumed lost at sea.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-4\">Larkins, fifty-five at the time of his death, took medication to control his epilepsy and high blood pressure. On June 11, two days before his disappearance, he was found unconscious in the chief steward\u2019s office. When he revived, Larkins said that he sometimes fainted when he failed to take his blood pressure medicine.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-5\">Larkins\u2019 widow brought suit under the Jones Act and under general maritime law. She argued at trial that the ship\u2019s officers were aware of Larkins\u2019 epileptic condition, but negligently failed to provide \u201cspecial precautions\u201d to protect him. She also asserted that the officers\u2019 failure to safeguard her husband rendered the vessel un-seaworthy. The jury held for the defendant, returning special verdicts that Farrell was not negligent and that the <em>Austral Pioneer </em>was not unseaworthy. We now consider appellant\u2019s various assignments of error in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-7\">Appellant\u2019s chief complaint is that the trial judge failed to instruct the jury that, under the doctrine of <em>res ipsa loquitur, </em>it could infer appellee\u2019s negligence and the vessel\u2019s unseaworthiness from the fact of Larkins\u2019 disappearance. We do not believe, however, that the disappearance presents circumstances that warrant a charge of inferred negligence or unseaworthiness. We hold, therefore, that the district court\u2019s refusal to give the requested instruction was proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-8\">The Supreme Court has developed a law of <em>res ipsa loquitur </em>in admiralty that permits the trier of fact to draw inferences of negligence from unexplained circumstances. <em>Johnson v. United States, </em>333 U.S. 46, 68 S.Ct. 391, 92 L.Ed. 468 (1948). Under the Jones Act, the standard of recovery has not been a strict one, and seamen have been afforded the \u201cjudicially developed doctrine of liability granted to railroad workers by the FELA,\u201d <em>Kernan v. American Dredging Co., </em>355 U.S. 426, 439, 78 S.Ct. 394, 401, 2 L.Ed.2d 382 (1958), including its light burden of proof on negligence and causation. While the standard of causation for unseaworthiness is \u201cmore demanding,\u201d <em>Chisholm v. Sabine Towing &amp; Transportation Co., </em>679 F.2d 60, 62 (5th Cir.1982), the plaintiff\u2019s burden in either case has been characterized as light. <em>Vallot v. Central Gulf Lines, </em>641 F.2d 347, 350 (5th Cir.1981). The jury\u2019s role, moreover, has been an important one in such cases, and doubts have been resolved in favor of submission. G. Gilmore and C. Black, <em>The Law of Admiralty </em>377 (2d ed. 1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b612-10\">In admiralty, <em>res ipsa loquitur </em>may be most relevant in determining which cases of unexplained circumstances should go to the jury. Where \u201cthe balance of probabilities\u201d might reasonably be found in favor of negligence, submission is required. The mere happening of an accident, however, does not give rise to a <em>res ipsa </em>inference of negligence or breach of duty under the Jones Act or general maritime law. <em>Kiesel v. American Trading Production Corp., </em>347 F.Supp. 673, 678-79 (D.Md.1972); <em>Ursick v. da Rosa, </em>328 F.2d 794 (9th Cir.1964). Where varying explanations are equally probable, <em>res ipsa loquitur </em>cannot apply. W. Prosser and W. Keeton, <em>Law of Torts, </em>248-49, 257-58 (5th ed. 1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b612-11\">While the historic purposes of admiralty law may favor jury resolution of personal injury claims, instructions on <em>res ipsa lo-quitur </em>should be carefully circumscribed where, as here, a seaman\u2019s disappearance is mysterious. Charging the jury to infer negligence or unseaworthiness from the fact of the seaman\u2019s disappearance, without more, invites a verdict based on sympathy or speculation. <em>See Swords v. American Sealanes, Inc., </em>443 F.2d 1324, 1325 (4th Cir.1971). A jury instruction on <em>res ipsa </em>under these circumstances may make the plaintiff\u2019s light burden nonexistent, and deprive the jury of its traditional role of assigning fault in negligence actions and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>assigning weight to circumstantial evidence. Such an instruction, in fact, all but directs a finding of liability where questions both of fault and causation may be much in dispute.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-5\">For a <em>res ipsa </em>instruction to be warranted, the plaintiff must establish that \u201c(1) the event is of a type which ordinarily does not happen in the absence of someone\u2019s negligence; (2) the instrumentality causing the injury was, at the time of the accident, within the exclusive control of the defendant; (3) the accident was not due to any voluntary action or contribution on the part of the plaintiff.\u201d <em>Olsen v. States Line, </em>378 F.2d 217, 220 (9th Cir.1967); <em>Savard v. Marine Contracting, </em>471 F.2d 536, 542 (2d Cir.1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b613-6\">Here, however, far too little is known of the facts surrounding Larkins\u2019 disappearance to \u201clet the thing speak for itself.\u201d Because the specific instrumentality that caused Larkins\u2019 disappearance is unknown, it is impossible to determine whether that instrumentality was in appellee\u2019s exclusive control. While appellee was in control of the <em>Austral Pioneer </em>itself, there is no evidence that the condition of the vessel\u2019s gear or appurtenances contributed to the disappearance. Larkins may have been swept overboard by the rough weather when, in spite of the captain\u2019s order to the contrary, he went up on deck. He may have committed suicide. An epileptic seizure may have played some part in this sad event, but exactly what part is unclear. The only evidence of negligence presented by the plaintiff \u2014 -that of the crew\u2019s alleged failure to take special precautions for an epileptic seaman \u2014 was a matter for the jury under the usual preponderance standard, not under a <em>res ipsa </em>instruction. Because varying explanations of Larkins\u2019 disappearance are possible, a <em>res ipsa </em>instruction is inappropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-7\">In <em>Swords v. American Sealanes, Inc., </em>443 F.2d 1324 (4th Cir.1971), this court reversed for lack of evidence a jury verdict on unseaworthiness in a seaman\u2019s unwit-nessed disappearance from his duty post. Judge Butzner dissented, arguing that a sagging chain guardrail warranted an inference of unseaworthiness sufficient to take the issue to the jury. <em>Id. </em>at 1326.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-9\">In the instant case, the trial judge allowed the issue of negligence and unseaworthiness to go to the jury on substantially less than a sagging guardrail. The court instructed the jury \u201con the \u2018slight negligence\u2019 test to be applied in determining liability under the Jones Act\u201d and on \u201cthe absolute duty of the shipowner in respect to unseaworthiness.\u201d <em>Rabb v. Canal Barge Company, </em>428 F.2d 201, 204 (5th Cir.1970). Its treatment of appellant was fair and even generous. Appellant\u2019s further request for a <em>res ipsa </em>instruction simply asks too much.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-10\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-11\">Appellant next contends that the trial court erred in instructing the jury that Larkins had a duty to disclose his epileptic condition during pre-voyage physical examinations and that he could not recover for negligence if he misrepresented his condition. Relying on <em>Still v. Norfolk &amp; Western Railway, </em>368 U.S. 35, 82 S.Ct. 148, 7 L.Ed.2d 103 (1961), appellant argues that concealment or misrepresentation may not serve to defeat a seaman\u2019s recovery for negligence under the Jones Act even when the misrepresentation bears a causal relationship to the injury involved. The instruction as given, however, is consistent with <em>Still.</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b613-12\">The trial judge instructed the jury that: If you find that decedent knowingly misrepresented his physical condition, and, that because of that misrepresentation defendant was justified in not taking special precautions for Larkins\u2019 safety, then you may not find the defendant negligent in that regard.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b613-13\">Appellant interprets this instruction to mean that, if Larkins misrepresented his epileptic condition, the jury was precluded from finding appellee negligent in <em>any </em>regard. The trial court\u2019s instruction, however, addressed only the failure to take special precautions. Under the Jones <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>Act, a shipowner\u2019s duty is to provide seamen with a safe place to work. <em>Michalic v. Cleveland Tankers, </em>364 U.S. 325, 327-28, 81 S.Ct. 6, 9-10, 5 L.Ed.2d 20 (1960). A shipowner is not obligated to provide any special precautions, however, unless he knows of a particular physical condition requiring such precautions. <em>Compare Carlton v. M/G Transport Services, </em>698 F.2d 846 (6th Cir.1983) (directed verdict for defendant upheld where defendant shipowner had no knowledge of seaman\u2019s heart disease) <em>with Mroz v. Dravo Corp., </em>293 F.Supp. 499 (W.D.Pa.1968), <em>aff\u2019d </em>429 F.2d 1156 (3d Cir.1970) (evidence sufficient to support finding of negligence where shipowner\u2019s medical examiner knew of cook\u2019s emphysema, but permitted her to work in conditions where she was forced to breathe diesel fumes). The trial court\u2019s instruction with respect to the shipowner\u2019s duty was necessary to convey to the jury a clear and correct understanding of the applicable law.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-4\">The instruction was also necessary because appellant put in dispute the qualifications of the physicians who conducted the pre-voyage examination and alleged that they were negligent in certifying decedent to be medically fit. Appellee thereupon put on testimony from the examining physicians as to the misrepresentation. Appellant cannot now complain that it was inappropriate for the trial judge to instruct the jury as to the misrepresentation.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-5\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-6\">Appellant further contends that the trial judge erred by requiring, as part of the unseaworthiness instruction, that the jury first determine whether Larkins\u2019 bout of unconsciousness two days before his disappearance put appellee on notice of Larkins\u2019 need for special precautions. The charge read as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b614-7\">[Liability for failing to recognize potentially serious medical problems, cannot be imposed where, considering all of the circumstances, Larkins\u2019 loss of consciousness would not have put a reasonable and prudent layman, trained in first aid, on notice of the existence of such problems. Therefore, unless you find that Larkins\u2019 loss of consciousness was so indicative of a serious medical problem, as to put defendant\u2019s personnel on notice that Larkins required protective precautions to ensure his safety, you must find the ship seaworthy.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b614-9\">To begin with, appellant failed to object to this instruction with the distinctness and specificity that Fed.R.Civ.P. 51 requires. The objection, if it can be termed that, was garbled, and failed to apprise the trial judge of its basis. Appellant apparently concedes that the trial record does not contain an adequate objection to the unseaworthiness charge, but contends that she made a fuller objection during a five and one half hour charge conference with the trial judge. That bare reference to an off-the-record statement affords no basis for appellate review. <em>King v. Ford Motor Co., </em>597 F.2d 436, 440 n. 3 (5th Cir.1979). The trial judge, moreover, understood that plaintiff agreed to the instruction in conference. The trial transcript makes clear that either no objection was made or that the trial judge did not understand it. In either case, appellant failed to comply with Rule 51.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-10\">We also decline appellant\u2019s invitation to hold the given instruction was plain error. Instances of plain error must be rare and reserved for denials of fundamental justice. <em>Furka v. Great Lakes Dredge &amp; Dock Co., </em>755 F.2d 1085, 1089-90 (4th Cir.1985). The instruction here worked no such harm. It is true, as appellant contends, that seaworthiness is \u201can absolute duty requiring no knowledge on the part of the shipowner.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1087, n. 3. Thus, in the ordinary case, where the alleged unseaworthy condition concerns faulty gear or appurtenances, the shipowner cannot raise lack of notice as a defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-11\">It is questionable, however, whether the instant claim even pertains to unseaworthiness. In this case, the alleged \u201cunseaworthiness\u201d was not a failure of the vessel or its crew to be \u201creasonably fit for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>their intended use,\u201d <em>Mitchell v. Trawler Racer, </em>362 U.S. 539, 550, 80 S.Ct. 926, 933, 4 L.Ed.2d 941 (1960), but the failure of the crew to provide special precautions to protect Larkins from injury due to his epileptic condition. The trial court\u2019s instruction with respect to notice was pertinent as to whether the physicians and crew even knew that special precautions were necessary. The notice instruction addressed only special precautions, not the general duty of unseaworthiness. Indeed, the jury received a proper general instruction that no notice was required to bring that duty into being.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-6\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-7\">Appellant\u2019s remaining assignments of error are easily addressed. She contends that the trial judge erroneously allowed into evidence the fact of Larkins\u2019 prior alcoholism and then compounded this prejudicial error in instructions to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-8\">We disagree. The trial judge enjoys broad discretion in balancing the relevance of evidence against its possible unfair prejudice under Fed.R.Evid. 403. The Rule 403 balance is essentially a matter of trial conduct; \u201cif judicial self-restraint is ever desirable, it is when a Rule 403 analysis of a trial court is reviewed by an appellate tribunal.\u201d <em>United States v. Long, </em>574 F.2d 761, 767 (3d Cir.1978). Here the evidence was relevant to the cause, severity, and treatment of Larkins\u2019 seizures, to plaintiff's complaints of medical malpractice, and to defendant\u2019s failure to take special precautions in his behalf.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-9\">The trial judge instructed the jury that Larkins\u2019 alcoholism did not play a part in his disappearance. That instruction was curative, not prejudicial. The mild instruction sought, in fact, to place the evidence in some perspective- for the jury after the emphasis of the matter in plaintiff\u2019s own closing argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-15\">VI.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-16\">Finally, appellant argues that the trial judge committed reversible error by refusing to strike the expert testimony of Dr. Ernest Niedermeyer. At trial, Dr. Nieder-meyer stated at one point that it was \u201ccommon sense\u201d to conclude through a process of elimination that Larkins committed suicide. According to appellant, the expert\u2019s statement was highly prejudicial because of the great weight that juries attach to such testimony and because the statement supplied a ready explanation for Larkins\u2019 disappearance. She argues also that the testimony usurped the jurors\u2019 duty to use their own common sense to reach a conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-11\">We decline to find an abuse of discretion in the refusal of the trial judge to strike this testimony. Dr. Niedermeyer used his expertise as an epileptologist to rule out the possibility that Larkins fell overboard during either \u201ca grand mal seizure\u201d or a \u201ctemporal lobe attack.\u201d He then testified to the existence of a correlation between epilepsy and suicide. The trial judge could well have concluded that the testimony was \u201cspecialized knowledge\u201d that would assist the jury within the parameters of Fed.R.Evid. 702 <em>et seq. </em>We likewise decline to adopt a rule that the use of the words \u201ccommon sense\u201d in the course of expert testimony automatically renders that testimony inadmissible. A review of the record indicates that Dr. Neidermeyer\u2019s judgment drew upon his medical specialty. What seems \u201ccommon sense\u201d to an expert may represent the intuitive application of accumulated expertise.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-12\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court is</p>\n<p id=\"b615-13\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
