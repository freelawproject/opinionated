We must decide whether the district court erred in dismissing the RICO claims and abused its discretion in failing to grant plaintiff leave to amend the complaint. We reverse and remand with instructions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1479-4\">I. FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b1479-5\">Plaintiff-appellant Schreiber Distributing Company (hereinafter Schreiber) is the exclusive wholesale distributor in Southern California of appliances manufactured by Chambers Corporation (hereinafter Chambers). Defendant-appellee Serv-Well Furniture Company, Inc. (hereinafter Serv-Well) is a wholesaler and retailer of appliances. Defendants-appellees John W. Lee and Larry Schaub are officers of Serv-Well. John Lee and Larry Schaub also are owners and officers of a Washington corporation, defendant-appellee Landmark Development Corporation (hereinafter Landmark). Defendant-appellee James A. Lee is an owner, officer, and director of Landmark. Defendant-appellee Bernard A. Schaub is an owner, officer, and director of Serv-Well.</p>\n<p id=\"b1479-6\">Prior to 1982, Schreiber was the principal supplier of Chambers\u2019 appliances to Serv-Well for resale by Serv-Well to consumers. In early 1982, Serv-Well sought to purchase products directly from Chambers and by-pass Schreiber, Chambers\u2019 exclusive distributor in the 48 contiguous states. To accomplish this, Serv-Well used Landmark as a \u201cdiverter.\u201d John and James Lee represented to Chambers that Landmark wished to distribute Chambers\u2019 products only in Canada and along the Alaskan North Slope. Because this arrangement would not violate Schreiber\u2019s exclusive distributorship, Chambers agreed and sent two rail cars of Chambers\u2019 products to Landmark in Washington for further transportation to Alaska. Landmark paid Chambers with funds provided by Serv-Well.</p>\n<p id=\"b1479-9\">Unknown to Chambers, the rail cars were diverted during shipment by John and James Lee, Landmark, and Serv-Well to the Los Angeles area where Serv-Well sold the products in competition with Schreiber.</p>\n<p id=\"b1479-10\">Schreiber filed suit in district court alleging violations of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1961-1968 (1982), along with 15 pendent state claims.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss was granted. The RICO counts were dismissed with prejudice for failure to state a cause of action. The pendent state claims were dismissed without prejudice to filing in state court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1479-11\">The district court dismissed Schreiber\u2019s RICO counts because Schreiber failed to allege: (1) a connection to organized crime; (2) a separate racketeering injury; (3) special facts relating to standing; and (4) an \u201centerprise\u201d separate and distinct from the \u201cpersons\u201d involved in the alleged scheme. The parties agree that the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Sedima, S.P.R.L. v. Imrex Co., </em>473 U.S. 479, 105 S.Ct. 3275, 87 L.Ed.2d 346 (1985), has eliminated from this appeal the first three grounds for dismissal. The defendants concede that the district court erred in requiring Schreiber to allege a connection to organized crime, a separate racketeering injury, and special facts concerning standing. <em>See Sedima, </em>105 S.Ct. at 3284-85, 3287. Thus, the only remaining issue is whether Schreiber has alleged a RICO enterprise sufficient to withstand a motion to dismiss. We raise two additional issues <em>sua sponte </em>in reviewing the sufficiency of Schreiber\u2019s allegations: (1) whether Schreiber has alleged a pattern of racketeering activity; and (2) whether <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1396\">*1396</page-number>Schreiber has alleged the RICO predicate acts with sufficient specificity under Fed.R.Civ.P. 9(b). We also must determine whether the district court abused its discretion in dismissing the RICO counts without leave to amend.</p>\n<p id=\"b1480-4\">We review <em>de novo </em>the granting of a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. <em>Miller v. Glen &amp; Helen Aircraft, Inc., 777 </em>F.2d 496, 498 (9th Cir.1985). We review \u201cstrictly\u201d a denial of leave to amend for abuse of discretion. <em>Mayes v. Leipziger, </em>729 F.2d 605, 608 (9th Cir.1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b1480-5\">II. PLEADING A RICO ENTERPRISE</p>\n<p id=\"b1480-6\">The district court dismissed Schreiber\u2019s RICO counts because, <em>inter alia, </em>it concluded Schreiber failed to allege an \u201centerprise\u201d separate and distinct from the \u201cpersons\u201d involved in the alleged scheme. Schreiber\u2019s complaint contains allegations against the individual defendants, John Lee and James Lee, as well as the corporate defendants, Serv-Well and Landmark. We address the sufficiency of the allegations involving these two groups under separate headings.</p>\n<p id=\"b1480-7\">A. The Corporate Defendants</p>\n<p id=\"b1480-8\">Paragraph 31 of the complaint alleged that defendants John Lee, James Lee, Serv-Well, and Landmark received income derived from a pattern of racketeering activity and used that income in the operation of the enterprises Serv-Well and Landmark in violation of section 1962(a). Title 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1962(a) provides in pertinent part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1480-9\">It shall be unlawful for any person who has received any income derived, directly or indirectly, from a pattern of racketeering activity ... to use or invest, directly or indirectly, any part of such income, or the proceeds of such income, in acquisition of any interest in, or the establishment or operation of, any enterprise which is engaged in, or the activities of which affect, interstate or foreign commerce____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1480-16\">Paragraph 32 alleged that the same four defendants maintained an interest in or control of the enterprises Serv-Well and Landmark through a pattern of racketeering activity in violation of section 1962(b). Title 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1962(b) provides in pertinent part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1480-17\">It shall be unlawful for any person through a pattern of racketeering activity ... to acquire or maintain, directly or indirectly, any interest in or control of any enterprise which is engaged in, or the activities of which affect, interstate or foreign commerce.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1480-18\">The word \u201cperson\u201d as used in section 1962 is defined in section 1961(3) as \u201cany individual or entity capable of holding a legal or beneficial interest in property____\u201d An enterprise is defined in section 1961(4) as \u201cany individual, partnership, corporation, association, or other legal entity, and any union or group of individuals associated in fact although not a legal entity____\u201d Because the defendant \u201cperson\u201d can be an entity, the issue arises whether that person can also be the affected enterprise.</p>\n<p id=\"b1480-22\">The courts have consistently held that in an action under section 1962(c) the \u201cperson\u201d must be a separate and distinct entity from the \u201centerprise.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Title 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1962(c) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1480-23\">It shall be unlawful for any person employed by or associated with any en<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1397\">*1397</page-number>terprise engaged in, or the activities of which affect, interstate or foreign commerce, to conduct or participate, directly or indirectly, in the conduct of such enterprise\u2019s affairs through a pattern of racketeering activity or collection of unlawful debt.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1481-4\">Schreiber has identified the defendant corporations as \u201cpersons\u201d and \u201centerprises\u201d under section 1962(a) and (b) only. Whether an \u201centerprise\u201d must be separate and distinct from the \u201cperson\u201d under sections 1962(a) and (b) is a novel question in this circuit.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1481-5\">The Seventh Circuit analyzed the necessary relationship between a person and an enterprise under section 1962(a) in <em>Haroco, Inc. v. American National Bank &amp; Trust Co., </em>747 F.2d 384 (7th Cir.1984), <em>aff\u2019d on other grounds, </em>473 U.S. 606, 105 S.Ct. 3291, 87 L.Ed.2d 437 (1985). The court in <em>Haroco </em>held that subsection (c) of section 1962 required separate entities as the person and the enterprise. 747 F.2d at 401-02. However, the court then recognized the significant differences between subsections (a) and (c):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1481-6\">However, a corporation-enterprise may be held liable under subsection (a) when the corporation is also a perpetrator. As we parse subsection (a), a \u201cperson\u201d (such as a corporation-enterprise) acts unlawfully if it receives income derived directly or indirectly from a pattern of racketeering activity in which the person has participated as a principal within the meaning of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2, and if the person uses the income in the establishment or <em>operation </em>of an enterprise affecting commerce. Subsection (a) does not contain any of the language in subsection (c) which suggests that the liable person and the enterprise must be separate. Under subsection (a), therefore, the liable person may be a corporation using the proceeds of a pattern of racketeering activity in its operations. This approach to subsection (a) thus makes the corporation-enterprise liable under RICO when the corporation is actually the direct or indirect beneficiary of the pattern of racketeering activity, but not when it is merely the victim, prize, or passive instrument of racketeering. This result is in accord with the primary purpose of RICO, which, after all, is to reach those who ultimately profit from racketeering, not those who are victimized by it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1481-9\"><em>Id. </em>at 402 (footnotes omitted) (emphasis in original). Because the parties in <em>Haroco </em>elected not to appeal their section 1962(a) claim, this language is essentially dicta.</p>\n<p id=\"b1481-10\">The Seventh Circuit adopted the <em>Haroco </em>dicta as the rationale for its holding in <em>Masi v. Ford City Bank &amp; Trust Co., </em>779 F.2d 397, 402 (7th Cir.1985). In <em>Masi </em>a depositor filed suit against a bank, claiming the bank had wrongfully converted funds in his Individual Retirement Account to pay off the balance of a defaulted loan guaranteed by him. <em>Id. </em>at 399. The depositor alleged the bank violated section 1962(a) of the RICO statute as well as state claims. <em>Id. </em>The Seventh Circuit held that the depositor could proceed against the bank under section 1962(a) as both the responsible \u201cperson\u201d and the \u201centerprise\u201d allegedly using income derived from racketeering activity. <em>Id. </em>at 401-02.</p>\n<p id=\"b1481-11\">We find the reasoning of the Seventh Circuit in <em>Haroco </em>and <em>Masi </em>persuasive. Section 1962(a) prohibits the investment of money which has been earned through acts of racketeering in an enterprise. <em>See </em>Fitzpatrick, <em>Elements of a RICO Action After </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1398\">*1398</page-number><em>Sedima, </em>6 Legal Notes &amp; Viewpoints Q. 1, 7 (1986) (hereinafter Fitzpatrick).</p>\n<p id=\"b1482-4\">\u201cLogic dictates that a corporation, receiving income from a pattern of racketeering in which it has participated as a principal, can invest that income in its own operations.\u201d <em>Pennsylvania v. Derry Construction Co., </em>617 F.Supp. 940, 943 (W.D.Pa.1985). Thus, we hold that where a corporation engages in racketeering activities and is the direct or indirect beneficiary of the pattern of racketeering activity, it can be both the \u201cperson\u201d and the \u201centerprise\u201d under section 1962(a). <em>See Haroco, </em>747 F.2d at 402.</p>\n<p id=\"b1482-5\">Similarly, section 1962(b) makes it unlawful to acquire an interest in or control of an enterprise through a pattern of racketeering activity. Where subsection (a) prohibits the use of money derived from racketeering to acquire an interest in an enterprise, subsection (b) prohibits engaging in racketeering activity to acquire or maintain an interest in or control of an enterprise. <em>See </em>Fitzpatrick, <em>supra, </em>at 7. Under either section 1962(a) or (b), however, the corporation necessarily must be the direct or indirect beneficiary of the pattern of racketeering activity to be both the \u201cperson\u201d and the \u201centerprise.\u201d <em>Cf. Haroco, </em>747 F.2d at 402 (corporation must be beneficiary to be \u201cperson\u201d and \u201centerprise\u201d under section 1962(a)).</p>\n<p id=\"b1482-6\">In this case, Schreiber alleged that Serv-Well and Landmark (1) engaged in the predicate acts of racketeering; (2) received income from the pattern of racketeering activity; and (3) used that income in their operations, all in violation of section 1962(a). Schreiber has sufficiently alleged that the corporate defendants were the beneficiaries of the pattern of racketeering activity under section 1962(a) and (b). Thus, the district court erred in dismissing the RICO counts against the corporate defendants Serv-Well and Landmark for failure to allege a \u201cperson\u201d separate from the \u201centerprise\u201d under section 1962(a) and (b). \u201cThis result is in accord with the primary purpose of RICO, which, after all, is to reach those who ultimately profit from racketeering, not those who are victimized by it.\u201d <em>Id.; cf. United States v. Turkette, </em>452 U.S. 576, 591, 101 S.Ct. 2524, 2532, 69 L.Ed.2d 246 (1981) (the major purpose of RICO is to address the infiltration of legitimate business by organized crime).</p>\n<p id=\"b1482-13\">B. The Individual Defendants</p>\n<p id=\"b1482-14\">The district court did not distinguish the individual defendants from the corporate defendants when it dismissed the RICO counts for failure to allege a \u201cperson\u201d separate and distinct from the \u201centerprise.\u201d This was error. Schreiber\u2019s allegations under section 1962(a), (b), and (c) named John Lee and James Lee as the \u201cpersons\u201d who allegedly violated those sections, and Serv-Well and Landmark as the \u201centerprises\u201d involved. The complaint did not label the individual defendants as both \u201cpersons\u201d and \u201centerprises\u201d under section 1962(a), (b), or (c). The fact that the complaint named the corporate defendants as \u201cpersons\u201d as well as \u201centerprises\u201d under section 1962(a) and (b) did not affect the sufficiency of the allegations as to the individuals John Lee and James Lee. The district court erred in dismissing the RICO counts against the individual defendants based on the person-enterprise distinction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1482-15\">III. PATTERN OF RACKETEERING ACTIVITY</p>\n<p id=\"b1482-16\">A. Pleading The Pattern</p>\n<p id=\"b1482-17\">An essential element of most civil RICO actions is an allegation that the defendant engaged in a pattern of racketeering activity.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Appellees contend the RICO counts were properly dismissed because Schreiber failed to allege a pattern of racketeering activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b1483-1\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1399\">*1399</page-number>Although section 1961(5) requires least two acts of racketeering activity\u201d in order to establish a pattern,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> the Supreme Court has indicated that two acts may not be sufficient. <em>Sedima, </em>105 S.Ct. at 3285 n. 14. The Supreme Court in <em>Sedima, </em>reviewed the legislative history of RICO and concluded that \u201ctwo isolated acts of racketeering activity do not constitute a pattern.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The Court stated: at</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1483-2\">The legislative history supports the view that two isolated acts of racketeering activity do not constitute a pattern. As the Senate Report explained: \u201cThe target of [RICO] is thus not sporadic activity. The infiltration of legitimate business normally requires more than one \u2018racketeering activity\u2019 and the threat of continuing activity to be effective. It is this factor of <em>continuity plus relationship </em>which combines to produce a pattern.\u201d S.Rep. No. 91-617, p. 158 (1969) (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1483-3\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1483-4\">As an aid in interpreting RICO\u2019s pattern requirement, the Court quoted from 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3575(e) (1982): \u201ccriminal conduct forms a pattern if it embraces criminal acts that have the same or similar purposes, results, participants, victims, or methods of commission, or otherwise are interrelated by distinguishing characteristics and are not isolated events.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1483-5\">Schreiber alleged that appellees fraudulently obtained a shipment of Chambers\u2019 products which they sold in Schreiber\u2019s exclusive territory. Schreiber\u2019s allegations sufficiently connect the alleged racketeering activity, i.e., wire and mail fraud, with the fraudulent diversion scheme: \u201c[T]he Defendants ... have engaged in racketeering activity ... by engaging on two or more occasions the use of the United States mail and/or use of interstate telephone calls for the purpose of executing or attempting to execute the aforesaid fraudulent scheme....\u201d Complaint \u00b6 30. These allegations satisfy the Supreme Court\u2019s requirement of a \u201cshowing of a relationship.\u201d <em>Sedima, </em>105 S.Ct. at 3285 n. 14. They also satisfy the pattern requirement of this circuit. <em>See United States v. Brooklier, </em>685 F.2d 1208, 1222 (9th Cir.1982) (\u201c[t]he pattern may be established by showing two or more acts that constitute offenses, conspiracies, or attempts of the requisite type, as long as the defendant committed two of the acts and both of them were connected by common scheme, plan or motive\u201d), <em>cert. denied, </em>459 U.S. 1206, 103 S.Ct. 1194, 75 L.Ed.2d 439 (1983); <em>see also Miller, 777 </em>F.2d at 498 (a pattern is \u201cat least two acts that are sufficiently related\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1483-9\">Schreiber\u2019s allegations did not establish, however, the \u201cthreat of continuing activity.\u201d <em>Sedima, </em>105 S.Ct. at 3285 n. 14. The complaint alleged the fraudulent diversion of a single shipment of Chambers\u2019 products in 1982. This appears to be an \u201cisolated event.\u201d <em>See id. </em>Because of the failure to allege facts establishing the \u201cthreat of continuing activity,\u201d Schreiber\u2019s complaint did not meet the requirement of a showing of \u201ccontinuity plus relationship which combines to produce a pattern.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The RICO counts were properly dismissed for failure to state a claim on this ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b1483-10\">B. Pleading The Racketeering Activity</p>\n<p id=\"b1483-11\">\u201cRacketeering activity\u201d is defined in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1961(1)(B) as including any act \u201cindictable\u201d under certain enumerated federal criminal statutes, including 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1341, which makes mail fraud a criminal offense, and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1343, which makes wire fraud a crime. Schreiber alleged in its complaint that appellees committed at least two violations of section 1341 and/or section 1343 in carrying out their scheme to defraud. Appellees argue that Sehreiber\u2019s complaint fails to state a claim \u201cbecause there was no mail or wire fraud on the facts of this case.\u201d We disagree with ap-pellees.</p>\n<p id=\"b1483-12\">To allege a violation of the mail fraud statute, it is necessary to show that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1400\">*1400</page-number>(1) the defendants formed a scheme or artifice to defraud; (2) the defendants used the United States mails or caused a use of the United States mails in furtherance of the scheme; and (3) the defendants did so with the specific intent to deceive or defraud. <em>United States v. Green, </em>745 F.2d 1205, 1207-08 (9th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 106 S.Ct. 259, 88 L.Ed.2d 266 (1985); <em>United States v. Bohonus, </em>628 F.2d 1167, 1171 (9th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>447 U.S. 928, 100 S.Ct. 3026, 65 L.Ed.2d 1122 (1980). Similarly, a wire fraud violations consists of (1) the formation of a scheme or artifice to defraud (2) use of the United States wires or causing a use of the United States wires in furtherance of the scheme; and (3) specific intent to deceive or defraud. <em>United States v. Louderman, </em>576 F.2d 1383, 1387-88 &amp; n. 3 (9th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>439 U.S. 896, 99 S.Ct. 257, 58 L.Ed.2d 243 (1978); <em>Bohonus, </em>628 F.2d at 1171 <em>&amp; </em>n. 7. The requirement of specific intent under these statutes is satisfied by \u201cthe existence of a scheme which was \u2018reasonably calculated to deceive persons of ordinary prudence and comprehension,\u2019 and this intention is shown by examining the scheme itself.\u201d <em>Green, </em>745 F.2d at 1207 (quoting <em>Bohonus, </em>628 F.2d at 1172). In a charge involving mail or wire fraud, it is not necessary to show that the scheme was successful or that the intended victim suffered a loss or that the defendants secured a gain. <em>Louderman, </em>576 F.2d at 1387 (quoting <em>United States v. O\u2019Malley, </em>535 F.2d 589, 592 (10th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>429 U.S. 960, 97 S.Ct. 383, 50 L.Ed.2d 326 (1976)). This is consistent with the purpose of the statutes, which is to proscribe the use of the mails or wires in any situation where it is closely entwined with fraudulent activity. <em>See United States v. Halbert, </em>640 F.2d 1000, 1009 (9th Cir.1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b1484-6\">Schreiber alleged the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1484-7\">1.

Construing the allegations of the complaint favorably to the pleader as we must, <em>Scheuer v. Rhodes, </em>416 U.S. 232, 236, 94 S.Ct. 1683, 1686, 40 L.Ed.2d 90 (1974), Schreiber pleaded the elements of mail and wire fraud sufficiently to withstand a motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b1484-19\">C. Specificity Of Fraud Allegations</p>\n<p id=\"AerQ\">Appellees contend that Schreiber failed to plead the circumstances of the fraudulent acts that form the alleged pattern of racketeering activity with sufficient specificity pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 9(b). This contention has merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b1484-20\">Rule 9(b) requires that \u201cthe circumstances constituting fraud ... be stated with particularity.\u201d We have held that Rule 9(b) \u201crequires the identification of the circumstances constituting fraud so that the defendant can prepare an adequate answer from the allegations.\u201d <em>Bosse v. Crowell Collier &amp; MacMillan, </em>565 F.2d 602, 611 (9th Cir.1977); <em>see also Walling v. Beverly Enterprises, </em>476 F.2d 393, 397 (9th Cir.1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b1485-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1401\">*1401</page-number>We have interpreted Rule 9(b) to mean that the pleader must state the time, place, and specific content of the false representations as well as the identities of the parties to the misrepresentation. <em>See Semegen v. Weidner, </em>780 F.2d 727, 731 (9th Cir.1985) (citing <em>Miscellaneous Service Workers, Drivers &amp; Helpers v. Philco-Ford Corp., </em>661 F.2d 776, 782 &amp; n. 16 (9th Cir.1981)); <em>Bosse, </em>565 F.2d at 611; <em>see also Lewis v. Sporck, </em>612 F.Supp. 1316, 1325 (N.D.Cal.1985) (allegations of mail fraud under section 1962(a)-1962(c) \u201cmust identify the time, place, and manner of each fraud plus the role of each defendant in each scheme\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1485-4\">Schreiber\u2019s complaint alleged that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1485-5\">[T]he Defendants Serv-Well, Landmark, John W. Lee and James A. Lee have engaged in racketeering activity ... by engaging on two or more occasions the use of the United States mail and/or use of interstate telephone calls for the purpose of executing or attempting to execute the aforesaid fraudulent scheme ... all of which conduct or acts are indictable under the provisions of Title 18, United States Code, Section 1341 (relating to mail fraud) and Section 1343 (relating to wire fraud).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1485-6\">Complaint \u00b6 30. However, the allegations describing the operative events failed to mention any use of the mails or telephones. Complaint \u00b6\u00b6 1-26. The allegations of paragraph 30, standing alone, were not sufficiently particular to satisfy Rule 9(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b1485-7\">IV. DISMISSAL OF RICO COUNTS WITH PREJUDICE</p>\n<p id=\"ank-dedup-1\">Schreiber contends the district court erred in dismissing with prejudice the RICO counts without allowing Schreiber leave to amend. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b1485-8\">Fed.R.Civ.P. 15(a) provides, <em>inter alia, </em>that \u201ca party may amend his pleading once as a matter of course at any time before a responsive pleading is served____\u201d We have stated that \u201c \u2018[a] motion to dismiss is not a \u201cresponsive pleading\u201d within the meaning of the Rule. Neither the filing nor granting of such a motion before answer terminates the right to amend; an order of dismissal denying leave to amend at that state is improper....\u2019\u201d <em>Mayes, </em>729 F.2d at 607 (quoting <em>Breier v. Northern California Bowling Proprietors\u2019 Association, </em>316 F.2d 787, 789 (9th Cir.1963)). If a complaint is dismissed for failure to state a claim, leave to amend should be granted unless the court determines that the allegation of other facts consistent with the challenged pleading could not possibly cure the deficiency. <em>Bonanno v. Thomas, </em>309 F.2d 320, 322 (9th Cir.1962).</p>\n<p id=\"b1485-14\">We find no indication of such a determination in this record. It is of no consequence that no request to amend the pleading was made in the district court. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1485-15\">Schreiber filed its complaint on November 9, 1983, and defendants filed their motion to dismiss on December 29, 1983. The district court dismissed the complaint without leave to amend on May 16, 1984. Defendants never filed a responsive pleading to the complaint. The district court did not find that allegation of other facts could not possibly cure the deficiency. Because the district court did not determine, nor can we conclude, that the allegation of other facts could not possibly cure the deficiencies in Schreiber\u2019s complaint, the district court abused its discretion in dismissing the RICO counts with prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b1485-16\">V. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1485-17\">The district court erred in dismissing Schreiber\u2019s RICO claims for:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1485-18\">1. failure to allege a connection to organized crime;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1485-19\">2. failure to allege a separate racketeering injury;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1485-20\">3. failure to allege special facts relating to standing; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1485-21\">4. failure to allege a \u201cperson\u201d separate and distinct from the \u201centerprise\u201d under section 1962(a), (b), and (c) with respect to the individual defendants John Lee and James Lee.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1485-22\">The district court erred in dismissing the RICO counts against the corporate defendants Serv-Well and Landmark for failure to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1402\">*1402</page-number>allege a \u201cperson\u201d separate from the \u201centerprise\u201d under section 1962(a) and (b). Schreiber sufficiently alleged that the corporate defendants were the beneficiaries of a pattern of racketeering activity under section 1962(a) and (b).</p>\n<p id=\"b1486-4\">Furthermore, Schreiber failed to allege facts establishing the \u201cthreat of continuing activity\u201d and did not plead a pattern under <em>Sedima. </em>Schreiber\u2019s complaint sets forth the elements of the predicate acts, mail and wire fraud; however, they are not pleaded with sufficient specificity under Fed.R.Civ.P. 9(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b1486-5\">Nevertheless, the district court abused its discretion by dismissing the RICO counts with prejudice. Defendants had not filed a responsive pleading and the district court did not determine that the allegation of other facts could not possibly cure the deficiencies. The district court also dismissed with prejudice Schreiber\u2019s claims under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1962(d). Upon remand, Schreiber should be allowed to replead these allegations as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b1486-6\">REVERSED and REMANDED with instructions to the district court to allow Schreiber to amend its complaint.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1479-7\">. The pendent state claims are: (1) fraud; (2) conspiracy to commit fraud; (3) breach of contract; (4) breach of implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing in contract between Landmark and Chambers; (5) breach of implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing in contract between Serv-Well and Schreiber; (6) estoppel; (7) unfair competition; (9) breach of fiduciary duty; (10) tortious interference with the contract between Chambers and Schreiber; (11) conspiracy to interfere with the contract between Chambers and Schreiber; (12) tortious interference with the contract between Chambers and Landmark; (13) conspiracy to tortiously interfere with the contract between Chambers and Landmark; (14) interference with Schreiber\u2019s business advantage; and (15) conspiracy to tortiously interfere with Schreiber\u2019s business advantage.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1480-10\">. <em>See, e.g., Bennett v.

Appellees contend our holding in <em>Rae v. Union Bank, </em>725 F.2d at 481 requires dismissal of Schreiber\u2019s claims under section 1962(a) and (b). This contention is without merit. <em>Rae v. Union Bank </em>concerned a claim under section 1962(c) only. Appellees argue that <em>Roe\u2019s </em>citation to <em>United States v. Computer Sciences Corp., </em>689 F.2d 1181, constitutes a wholesale acceptance of that case which involved claims under both sections 1962(a) and (c). We disagree. The holding in <em>Rae </em>is narrower than the holding in <em>Computer Sciences </em>in that <em>Rae </em>concerned only section 1962(c). The citation to <em>Computer Sciences </em>indicates Ninth Circuit acceptance of <em>Computer Sciences </em>only to the extent necessary to decide Rae\u2019s section 1962(c) claim. <em>Rae </em>is not dispositive of Schreiber\u2019s claims under sections 1962(a) and (b). Schreiber does not allege that Serv-Well or Landmark violated section 1962(c).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1482-7\">. One of the essential elements a plaintiff must prove in a private RICO action under \u00a7 1962(a)-1962(d) is \"a pattern of racketeering activity\" or the \"collection of an unlawful debt.\u201d However, most of the private RICO actions involve a pattern of racketeering activity rather than the collection of an unlawful debt. In this case, Schreiber alleges the appellees accomplished unlawful objectives through a pattern of racketeering activity.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1483-7\">. Section 1961(5) states that a pattern \"requires at least two acts of racketeering activity, one of which occurred after the effective date of this chapter and the last of which occurred within ten years ... after the commission of a prior act of racketeering activity.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b1486-7\">KENNEDY, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"Av6\">concurring:</p>\n<p id=\"b1486-8\">The potential range of criminal prosecution under the federal mail and wire fraud laws is vast, made so in part by expansive judicial interpretation. <em>United States v. McNeive, </em>536 F.2d 1245, 1247 (9th Cir.1976); <em>Gregory v. United States, </em>253 F.2d 104, 110 (5th Cir.1958). The reach of those statutes exists against a backdrop of prosecutorial discretion, however, discretion which, if sensitively exercised, operates as a check to the improvident exertion of federal power. No such check operates in the civil realm. A company eager to weaken an offending competitor obeys no constraints when it strikes with the sword of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1961-1968 (1982) (RICO).</p>\n<p id=\"b1486-10\">It is most unlikely that Congress envisaged use of the RICO statute in a case such as the one before us, but we are required to follow where the words of the statute lead, <em>Sedima, S.P.R.L. v. Imrex Co., </em>473 U.S. 479, 105 S.Ct. 3275, 87 L.Ed.2d 346 (1985), and I agree with my colleagues that a claim for relief might be stated on these facts. Thus, federal power inches forward when a statute is left unattended, whether from Congress\u2019 indifference or its acquiescence. I concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
