We reverse the order of the district court and remand this case for further consideration in light of our holding herein.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-28\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-29\">This case arises from the imposition of an estate tax deficiency by the Internal Revenue Service against the estate of Melanie B. McCarthy (\u201cdecedent\u201d). The plaintiff-appellees, Daniel F. McCarthy (\u201cMcCar<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>thy\u201d) and First National Bank &amp; Trust Company of Evanston serve as trastees of the McCarthy estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-4\">The decedent died on May 24, 1980. Pri- or to her death she maintained a joint checking account with her son, McCarthy, at First National Bank and Trust of Evans-ton. McCarthy had authority to write checks on the account and did so on many occasions to pay the decedent\u2019s bills and to make gifts upon her request. During the period from May 15, 1980 to May 22, 1980 McCarthy wrote nine $3,000 checks which the decedent intended as gifts to various relatives. While all of the checks were delivered or mailed to the intended donee prior to the decedent\u2019s death, none were cashed before that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-5\">The plaintiffs did not include as assets of the estate, the nine $3,000 checks totaling $27,000 remaining in the decedent\u2019s checking account at the time of her death. The Internal Revenue Service assessed the estate for additional taxes totaling $8,349 plus interest relating to the inclusion of the $27,000. The district court held that the uncashed checks were completed gifts for purposes of federal estate tax law and therefore, not includible in the decedent\u2019s estate. Additionally, the court held that even if the gifts were not complete until paid by the banks, upon such payment, the date of the completed gift related back to the date of original delivery. For the reasons set forth below, we reverse the order of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-7\">The particular issue presented for review here arises upon the timing of the decedent\u2019s death between the writing of the disputed checks and the debiting of decedent\u2019s account. Section 2031(a) of the Internal Revenue Code defines gross estate as including \u201cthe value at the time of his [decedent\u2019s] death of all property, real or personal, tangible or intangible, wherever situated.\u201d I.R.C. \u00a7 2031(a) (1985). Section 2035(a) provides that gifts made by a decedent within three years of death are to be included in the gross estate. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 2035(a). However, an exception to this general rule appears in section 2035(b)(2) which excludes any gift made by a decedent up to $3,000 per donee, per calendar year. I.R.C. \u00a7 2035(b)(2) (1980).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Whether the decedent in fact \u201cmade\u201d or completed a gift of the nine checks prior to her death is the question now before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-11\">The district court concluded that within the meaning of federal tax law the decedent relinquished dominion and control of the checks sufficient to establish a completed gift. In so holding, the court indicated that while it found Illinois state law \u201cinfluential,\u201d federal law determined whether a gift was complete for federal estate tax purposes. We conclude that the district court erred in disregarding the relevant Illinois law.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-12\">This case involves the link between gift and estate taxation, the provisions of which must be read together. <em>Estate of Sanford v. Commissioner, </em>308 U.S. 39, 44, 60 S.Ct. 51, 56, 84 L.Ed. 20 (1939). The estate tax is levied on all the decedent\u2019s \u201cproperty, real or personal, tangible or intangible.\u201d 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 2031(a). The definition of \u201cproperty\u201d is a problem of state law, because that is the source of rules identifying and limiting personal interests in assets. <em>Howard v. United States, </em>125 F.2d 986, 989 (5th Cir.1942). But whether Mrs. McCarthy had a \u201cproperty\u201d interest in the money represented by the checks depends on whether her gifts were completed by the time of her death. That depends initially on whether the gifts would be sufficient to trigger a gift tax (in the absence of the $3,000 exclusion), for under the Code if the property was not given, sold, or destroyed, it must still be in the estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-13\">Treas.Reg. \u00a7 25.2511-2(b) states that a gift is complete when \u201cthe donor has so parted with dominion and control [over <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>the property] as to leave him no power to change its disposition.\u201d Subsection (c) adds that a gift is incomplete when \u201ca donor reserves the power to revest the beneficial title to the property in himself.\u201d <em>See also Burnett v. Guggenheim, </em>288 U.S. 280, 286, 53 S.Ct. 369, 371, 77 L.Ed. 748 (1933), and <em>Estate of Sanford, </em>308 U.S. at 43, 60 S.Ct. at 55-56, both emphasizing that the existence of a gift depends on effectual transfer of control over the economic benefits of property. <em>Cf. Dickman v. Commissioner, </em>465 U.S. 330, 338 n. 7, 104 S.Ct. 1086, 1091 n. 7, 79 L.Ed.2d 343 (1984). Whether Mrs. McCarthy had \u201cpower\u201d over the money in her checking account after writing the checks or instead had relinquished \u201cdominion and control\u201d also is a question of state law, for no federal rules govern when checks must be paid. The Supreme Court\u2019s cases confirm this principle. The Court has consistently said that \u201cstate law creates legal interests but ... the federal statute determines when and how they shall be taxed.\u201d <em>Burnet v. Harmel, </em>287 U.S. 103, 110, 53 S.Ct. 74, 77, 77 L.Ed. 199 (1932); <em>see also United States v. Mitchell, </em>403 U.S. 190, 197, 91 S.Ct. 1763, 1768, 29 L.Ed.2d 406 (1971) (\u201cIn the determination of ownership, state law controls.\u201d); <em>Blair v. Commissioner, </em>300 U.S. 5, 9-10, 57 S.Ct. 330, 332, 81 L.Ed. 465 (1936) (\u201cThe question of the validity of the assignments is a question of local law.\u201d); <em>cf. Helvering v. Stuart, </em>317 U.S. 154, 161, 63 S.Ct. 140, 144, 87 L.Ed. 154 (1942).</p>\n<p id=\"b231-5\">Hence, we must examine the relevant Illinois law regarding the completion of a gift. To constitute a valid gift, it is essential that the donee prove delivery of the property by the donor, with the intent to pass the title to the donee absolutely and irrevocably, and the donor must relinquish all present and future dominion and power over the subject matter of the gift. <em>In re Estate of Waggoner, </em>5 Ill.App.2d 130, 125 N.E.2d 154 (3rd Dist.1955); <em>In re Estate of Jarmuth, </em>329 Ill.App. 619, 70 N.E.2d 336 (1st Dist.1946); <em>Estate of Williams v. Tuch, </em>313 Ill.App. 230, 39 N.E.2d 695 (1st Dist.1942). The gift must be completed and executed in the lifetime of the donor, and if not so completed during her lifetime, her death revokes the part which has been performed. <em>In re Estate of Carlin, </em>5 Ill.App.2d 241, 125 N.E.2d 649 (1st Dist.1955); <em>Waggoner, </em>5 Ill.App.2d at 130, 125 N.E.2d 154.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-7\">The problematic element here is the requirement that the donor relinquish all present and future dominion and power over the subject matter of the gift. Illinois case law indicates that in the absence of consideration from the payee to the drawer of a check, a timely filing of a stop payment order by the drawer operates to extinguish any liability of the drawer to the payee. <em>Falco, Inc. v. Bates, </em>30 Ill.App.3d 570, 334 N.E.2d 169 (4th Dist.1975); <em>see also Leavitt v. Charles R. Hearn, Inc., </em>19 Ill.App.3d 980, 312 N.E.2d 806 (1st Dist. 1974) (mere issuance of a check does not constitute an immediate assignment of funds from drawee to payee (citing Ill.Rev.Stat. ch. 26, para. 3-409(1) (1971))); <em>cf. Meyer v. Meyer, </em>379 Ill. 97, 39 N.E.2d 311 (1942) (gift is not complete until note is paid). Hence, by operation of Illinois law the decedent failed to relinquish future dominion and power over the checks, thus preventing completion of the intended gifts. Therefore, section 2035(b)(2) of the Internal Revenue Code is inapplicable to the disputed checks which must now be included in the decedent\u2019s gross estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-8\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-9\">The district court alternatively based its holding upon an extension of the relation back doctrine articulated in <em>Estate of Spie-gel v. Commissioner, </em>12 T.C. 524 (1949). There, the tax court held that for purposes of allocating annual income tax deductions, a check delivered as a charitable contribution was considered a payment in the year delivered, even though not debited from the donor\u2019s account until the subsequent year. <em>Id. </em>at 529. This doctrine was expanded to the estate tax area in <em>Estate of Belcher v. Commissioner, </em>83 T.C. 227 (1984), where the tax court held that delivery of a check for charitable purposes, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>though cashed after the donor\u2019s death, relates back to the date of delivery and is therefore, not includible in a decedent's gross estate. <em>Id. </em>at 235.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-4\">In so holding, the tax court compared giving a charitable donation with the discharge of a bona fide legal obligation by payment of a check cashed after the transmitter\u2019s death. The court recognized that the tax regulations exclude from a decedent\u2019s gross estate any outstanding checks given in discharge of a bona fide legal obligation.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The court reasoned that this exclusion was based upon a \u201cpractical rule of a reason,\u201d since such payments would also be deductible under section 2035(a)(3) [sic] of the tax code as claims against the estate, thus creating a \u201cwash.\u201d <em>Belcher, </em>83 T.C. at 232. Drawing upon this same rationale, the court extended the relation back doctrine to outstanding checks issued to charitable donees, since \u201c[t]he inclusion of these checks would at the very least create the possibility that they would qualify as section 2035 [sic] charitable deductions, again creating a \u2018wash.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>The court, however, explicitly and emphatically distinguished charitable from noncharitable donees stating that, \u201cpolicy considerations may well justify the inclusion of outstanding checks issued to noncharitable donees.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 232, 238.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-5\">Citing the opinion of the district court, the appellees contend that the relation back doctrine should now be extended to noncharitable donees. Specifically, they maintain that as with charitable donations, no policy considerations justify including in a decedent\u2019s estate outstanding checks issued to noncharitable donees. However, the common element present both in regulation 20.2031-5 (exclusion of bona fide legal obligations) and <em>Belcher </em>which warranted application of the relation back doctrine was not merely the lack of a sufficiently compelling justification for inclusion; but, was rather the existence of an offsetting deduction creating the possibility of a wash. No such practical consideration extends to noncharitable gifts. No offsetting deduction exists for gifts made to non-charitable donees. The exclusion from a decedent\u2019s gross estate of gifts up to $3,000 operates only upon completion of that gift prior to the donor\u2019s death. I.R.C. \u00a7 2035(b)(2) (1980). It is circuitous to argue that this exemption supports application of the relation back doctrine in the same manner as the deductions available in <em>Belcher. </em>The exemption has no effect upon an incomplete gift and therefore, does not engender a wash as in <em>Belcher.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b232-8\">Moreover, contrary to appellee\u2019s contentions, there remains sufficient justification compelling the inclusion of outstanding checks issued to noncharitable donees. The Internal Revenue Code now exempts only those gifts <em>made </em>by a decedent up to $10,000 per donee, per year. I.R.C. \u00a7 2035(b)(2) (1985). To the extent of that exemption, application of the relation back doctrine fosters estate tax avoidance. By issuing a check to a noncharitable donee with the understanding that it not be cashed until after his death, a decedent may effectively bequest up to $10,000 per donee, thus avoiding the estate tax consequences normally attending such transactions. Clearly, section 2035(b)(2) was never intended to operate in such a manner. Only after a donee has parted with complete dominion and control of funds does section 2035(b)(2) exempt them from the general rule that all gifts made within three years of death are to be included in the donor\u2019s gross estate. I.R.C. \u00a7 2035(a) (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b233-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court is</p>\n<p id=\"b233-4\">Reversed and Remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b230-8\">. The 1981 amendments provide for a $10,000 per year, per donee exception. I.R.C. \u00a7 2035 (1985).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b232-6\">.

If bank checks outstanding at the time of the decedent's death and given in discharge of bona fide legal obligations of the decedent incurred for an adequate and full consideration in money or money\u2019s worth are subsequently honored by the bank and charged to the decedent\u2019s account, the balance remaining in the account may be returned, but only if the obligations are not claimed as deductions from the gross estate.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
