LEON HIGGINBOTHAM, Jr., Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b1271-21\">These two appeals consider the proper treatment under the Medicare Act of interest and depreciation costs incurred by a health care provider in converting from for-profit to non-profit legal status, in providing hospital food services, and in operating a hospital snack bar. The district court, in an unpublished opinion,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> entered summary judgment for appellant, the Monsour Medical Center (\u201cCenter\u201d) on the \u201cconversion costs\u201d issue. It found that the Provider Reimbursement Review Board (\u201cPRRB\u201d or \u201cBoard\u201d) decision denying reimbursement for these costs<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> was not supported by substantial evidence on the record, and remanded the matter to the PRRB \u201cwith instructions to properly reimburse [appellant] for these costs.\u201d Cross-Appellant, the Secretary of Health and Human Services (\u201cSecretary\u201d), appeals from this judgment. We will direct that the district court\u2019s award of summary judgment on this issue to the Center be vacated and that summary judgment be entered in favor of the Secretary. The district court also entered summary judgments for the Secretary, finding that the PRRB\u2019s deci<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1188\">*1188</page-number>sions allocating certain dietary costs to the Center\u2019s nonreimbursable snack bar and denying reimbursement for employee snack bar meals were supported by substantial evidence. The Center appeals from these judgments. We will affirm these summary judgments of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1272-4\">FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"A8V\">This complicated story began, for our purposes, with the establishment in 1952 of a private hospital, the Monsour Hospital and Clinic, Inc. of Jeanette, Pennsylvania. The founders and sole shareholders of this Pennsylvania for-profit corporation were three brothers, Doctors Howard, Robert and Roy Monsour, and their parents. A fourth brother, Doctor William Monsour, became involved in this corporation at a later date. In 1966, subsequent to the passage of Title XVIII of the Social Security Act, 79 Stat. 291, as amended, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395 <em>et seq. </em>(1982), commonly known as the Medicare Act, Robert, Roy and William Monsour, their mother, Eva Monsour, and their cousin, Doctor Omar Ayoub, created the Monsour Medical Foundation (\u201cFoundation\u201d), a Pennsylvania non-profit corporation. Their plan, soon realized, was for the Foundation to assume control of the hospital. On May 17, 1975, these five Monsour family members, who at that time owned all of the Monsour Hospital and Clinic stock, together sold 3.5 percent of this stock in their hospital to the Foundation for $500,000. At or about the same time, the family members donated an additional 46.7 percent of their outstanding stock, valued at $7,064,765, to the Foundation.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The hospital then redeemed the remaining 49.8 percent of its outstanding stock from these Monsour family members by signing a fifteen-year installment note of $7.5 million. Interest due on this note was, after the first five years,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> pegged to the prime rate,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and the note was secured by a second mortgage on the hospital\u2019s real estate holdings. These three transactions, which left the Foundation as the sole stockholder in the hospital and the five Monsour family members as its mortgagees, constituted the financial aspects of the conversion. The hospital, now owned by the Foundation, was subsequently reorganized as a Pennsylvania non-profit corporation and renamed the Monsour Medical Center.</p>\n<p id=\"b1272-7\">In addition to these financial complexities, this case also involves a web of corporate governing bodies. As the incorpo-rators of and stockholders in the original for-profit hospital, the Monsour brothers sat on its corporate board and served as its corporate officers. Prior to the May, 1975 stock sale, donation and redemption, they resigned. The Foundation, at the May 19, 1975 meeting where it approved the conversion, appointed a new hospital board and slate of officers consisting of no Monsour family members. In addition, five family members (Howard, Robert, Roy and William Monsour, and Ayoub) were the Foundation\u2019s original trustees, and they appointed the eight additional trustees who served with them as the Foundation Board of Directors. This Board subsequently created a six-member Executive Committee to over<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1189\">*1189</page-number>see operations of both the Foundation and the Center.</p>\n<p id=\"b1273-5\">For the hospital cost years in issue here, Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Western Pennsylvania (\u201cBlue Cross\u201d) served as the government\u2019s fiscal intermediary under the Medicare program.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Until April, 1981, Blue Cross reimbursed the Center for the conversion-related interest and depreciation expenses; at that time, Blue Cross disallowed reimbursement for these expenses and reclaimed all such expenses it had previously paid to the Center, claiming that the conversion had not been an arm\u2019s length transaction between unrelated parties. The Secretary subsequently invoked this same reason for disallowing, in December, 1981, the reimbursement of appellant\u2019s conversion-related expenses. Appellant maintains that these actions affect \u201c$2,117,842 in previously-reimbursed depreciation and interest expenses [for fiscal years 1977-1980] ... [and] $1,560,482 in depreciation and interest expenses for [fiscal year] 1981.\u201d Brief for Appellant at 13. As a result, these actions in 1981 \u201creduced Medicare reimbursement to the [Center] by approximately $1,381,000.\u201d Id.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1273-14\">Blue Cross, seeking both recovery of damages in the amount of its previous reimbursements for what it subsequently determined were not reimbursable costs and a declaratory judgment that the Center\u2019s conversion costs were as a matter of law not reimbursable under Medicare, sued the Center, the Monsour brothers and the Monsour Hospital and Clinic, Inc., the former owner of the Center, in Pennsylvania state court in 1982. These defendants filed counterclaims against Blue Cross seeking damages for defamation and a declaration that the conversion costs <em>were </em>reimbursable as a matter of law. After a three-week bench trial, the state court<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> declared in 1983 for the defendants that, because the hospital sale involved unrelated parties,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> the conversion costs were reimbursable under the Medicare program through Blue Cross, the intermediary. <em>Blue Cross of W. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1190\">*1190</page-number><em>Pa. v. Monsour Medical Center, </em>No. GD 82-4968 (Pa.Ct. Common Pleas Feb. 2, 1983).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Following the state court decision, the Secretary continued to disallow reimbursement for the Center\u2019s conversion-related costs. The Center then challenged the Secretary\u2019s refusal to reimburse by filing a complaint with the PRRB. On October 6 and 7, 1983, a PRRB hearing was held, as provided by statute, <em>see </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395oo(a) (Supp. III 1985), to assess the Center\u2019s contentions on six distinct Medicare reimbursement issues. The PRRB found, <em>inter alia, </em>that the Foundation trustees who approved the conversion transactions</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1274-4\">were acting as surrogates of the [Mons-our] family to implement the final stages of a corporate long-term plan [that] had been adopted by the Foundation in a prior period when it was controlled by the Monsour family____ There is no question that the Family, the Foundation, and the [hospital] were related when the entire transaction was specifically planned. The fact that the transaction was executed almost precisely as planned demonstrates the continuation of substantial control in fact.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1274-7\"><em>Monsour Medical Center v. Blue Cross &amp; Blue Shield Ass\u2019n/Blue Cross of W. Pa., </em>PRRB Hearing Dec. No. 80-24, at 20 (June 14, 1984); Appellant\u2019s App. at A64. This June 14, 1984 PRRB decision<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> was subsequently adopted by the Secretary, and the Center appealed the Board\u2019s adverse determinations to the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1274-8\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1274-9\">Federal court jurisdiction to review a final decision of the PRRB affirmed by the Secretary is conferred by 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395oo(f)(1) (Supp. III 1985). Under the express terms of the Administrative Procedure Act (\u201cA.P.A.\u201d), 5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 551-59 &amp; 701-06 (1982), the \u201caction, findings, and conclusions\u201d of such \u201can agency hearing provided by statute\u201d are to be held \u201cunlawful and set aside\u201d by the reviewing court if they are \u201cunsupported by substantial evidence.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706(2)(E) (1982). \u201cIn making the foregoing determinations, the court shall review the whole record....\u201d <em>Id. Accord </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405 (1982) (\u201cThe findings of the Secretary as to any fact, if supported by substantial evidence, shall be conclusive....\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1274-14\">We are, in effect, the second \u201cappellate\u201d court to consider the factual bases of PRRB\u2019s challenged findings. Our review applies, as did the district court\u2019s, the substantial evidence test. In an attempt to clarify the practical meaning of this test, we set forth the oft-quoted language of the Supreme Court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1274-15\">\u201c[substantial evidence is more than a mere scintilla. It means such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u201d ... Accordingly, it \u201cmust do more than create a suspicion of the existence of the fact to be established____ [I]t must be enough to justify, if the trial were to a jury, a refusal to direct a verdict when the conclusion sought to be drawn from it is one of fact for the jury.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1274-17\"><em>Universal Camera Corp. v. NLRB, </em>340 U.S. 474, 477, 71 S.Ct. 456, 459, 95 L.Ed. 456 (1951) (citations omitted). <em>See also D &amp; D Distribution Co. v. NLRB, </em>801 F.2d 636, 638 (3d Cir.1986). The test</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A9e\">requires] that the evidence be \u201csubstantial\u201d after the reviewing court takes into account \u201cwhatever in the record [fairly] detracts from its weight.\u201d Thus, the evidence must be sufficient to support the conclusion of a reasonable person after considering the evidentiary record as a whole, not just the evidence that is consistent with the agency\u2019s finding.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1274-18\">R. Pierce, S. Shapiro &amp; P. Verkuil, <em>Administrative Law &amp; Process </em>358-59 (1985) (quoting <em>Universal Camera, </em>340 U.S. at 488, 71 S.Ct. at 465). Overall, this test is deferential, and we grant similar deference <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1191\">*1191</page-number>to agency inferences from facts if those inferences are supported by substantial evidence, \u201ceven [where] this court acting <em>de novo </em>might have reached a different conclusion.\u201d <em>Hunter Douglas, Inc. v. NLRB, </em>804 F.2d 808, 812 (3d Cir.1986) (citations omitted). Our review of an agency\u2019s interpretation of legal precepts, as demonstrated by its application of such precepts to the facts, is, of course, plenary. <em>See D &amp; D Distribution Co., </em>801 F.2d at 638 (citing <em>Allbritton Communications Co. v. NLRB, </em>766 F.2d 812, 817 (3d Cir.1985), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 106 S.Ct. 850, 88 L.Ed.2d 891 (1986)). The Court's role in conducting such review \u201cis not to impose its own interpretation of the ... regulation, but instead to defer to [an agency\u2019s] position so long as it is reasonable.\u201d <em>Butler County Memorial Hosp. v. Heckler, </em>780 F.2d 352, 355 (3d Cir.1985) (citing <em>Presinza-no v. Hoffman-La Roche, Inc., </em>726 F.2d 105, 111 (3d Cir.1984)). In sum, so long as an agency\u2019s factfinding is supported by substantial evidence, reviewing courts lack power to reverse either those findings or the reasonable regulatory interpretations that an agency manifests in the course of making such findings of fact.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1275-5\">A. <em>Conversion Costs</em></p>\n<p id=\"avz-dedup-0\">Appellant Monsour Medical Center seeks Medicare reimbursement for the sizable interest expenses it incurred pursuant to its 1975 mortgage agreement with members of the Monsour family. It also seeks Medicare reimbursement, at a \u201cstepped up\u201d basis that reflects the price at which it purchased the hospital from Monsour family members in 1975, for its depreciation expenses since the conversion. The district court granted the Center\u2019s motion for summary judgment on these issues, and the Secretary, as cross-appellant, now appeals from that portion of the district court\u2019s order. At issue in this cross-appeal are reimbursement claims dating back to fiscal year 1977. To assess the validity of the PRRB\u2019s treatment of these claims, we turn first to the applicable federal regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b1275-9\">According to the Medicare regulations, a health care provider\u2019s interest expenses are an allowable cost (i.e., reimbursable) if they are \u201cpaid to a lender not related through control or ownership, or personal relationship to the borrowing organization.\u201d 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 405.419(b)(3)(h) (1985). As to determining the proper cost basis of a provider (i.e., the purchase price figure from which its depreciation costs are to be calculated), the regulations provide that, \u201c[i]f the purchaser cannot demonstrate that the sale was bona fide, ... [its] cost basis shall not exceed the seller\u2019s cost basis, less accumulated depreciation.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 405.-415(g)(3) (1985). For both determinations,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> the crucial inquiry concerns the relationship between the Foundation and the Mons-our family (i.e., the buyer and the seller of the hospital facility). The \u201crelated organizations\u201d provision, 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 405.427 (1985),<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> which provides for the allowance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1192\">*1192</page-number>of certain costs incurred by a provider\u2019s \u201crelatives,\u201d offers these definitions of \u201corganizations related to the provider by common ownership or control:\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1276-4\">(b) <em>Definitions </em>\u2014 (1) <em>Related to provider. </em>Related to the provider means that the provider to a significant extent is associated or affiliated with or has control of or is controlled by the organization furnishing the services, facilities, or supplies.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1276-5\">(2) <em>Common ownership. </em>Common ownership exists when an individual or individuals possess significant ownership or equity in the provider and the institution or organization serving the provider.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1276-6\">(3) <em>Control. </em>Control exists where an individual or an organization has the power, directly or indirectly, significantly to influence or direct the actions or policies of an organization or institution.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1276-7\"><em>Id. </em>Applying this precise definition of \u201ccontrol\u201d as the governing legal precept in this matter, we will hold that substantial evidence on the record supported the PRRB\u2019s finding that the Foundation and the Monsour family were related parties at the time of the conversion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1276-8\">1. <em>The Governing Legal Precepts</em></p>\n<p id=\"Aud\">The PRRB and the district court, in their respective analyses of these reimbursement issues, disagreed fundamentally on the proper application of the relevant Medicare regulations. In assessing the \u201crelatedness\u201d of the Monsour family and the Foundation, the Board looked to \u201cthe corporate long-term planning period.\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> <em>Monsour Medical Center v. Blue Cross &amp; Blue Shield Ass\u2019n/Blue Cross of W. Pa., </em>PRRB Hearing Dec. No. 80-24, at 20 (June 14, 1984); Appellant\u2019s App. at A64. The district court, by contrast, believed that focusing on that earlier time period \u201cbegfged] the issue, i.e., whether the Mons-ours continued to control the Center <em>after </em>the sale.\u201d <em>Monsour Medical Center v. Heckler, </em>No. 84-1938, at 11 (W.D.Pa. Dec. 30, 1985); Appellant\u2019s App. at A79. Although the regulations \u2014 like the analyses of this issue by both the PRRB and the district court \u2014 lack ideal clarity, we will accept the PRRB\u2019s interpretation of them.</p>\n<p id=\"b1276-13\">The regulation governing depreciation, although it does not speak of control or relatedness,<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> requires a purchaser of a care providing facility to demonstrate \u201cthat the sale was bona fide.\u201d 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 405.-415(g)(3) (1985). We interpret this regulation as addressing the \u201cbona fides\u201d of a sale <em>at the time of that sale. </em>The regulation governing interest costs \u201cpaid to a lender ... [by] the borrowing organization\u201d does speak of \u201ccontrol,\u201d \u201cpersonal relationship\u201d and \u201crelated[ness].\u201d 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 405.419(b)(3)(ii) (1985). We interpret this regulation as addressing, though less clearly than the previous regulation, the \u201ccontrol,\u201d \u201cpersonal relationship\u201d and \u201crelated[ness]\u201d of parties to a loan <em>at the time of their borrowing and lending. </em>So far as we can ascertain from its hearing decision, these were and are the PRRB\u2019s interpretations of its governing regulations.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> As a reviewing court constrained by the A.P.A., \u201c[w]e must ... accept the agency\u2019s view so long as the \u2018interpretation[s are] within the range of reasonable meanings that the words of the regula<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1193\">*1193</page-number>tion[s] admit.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> <em>Butler County Memorial Hospital, </em>780 F.2d at 355-56 (quoting <em>Psychiatric Institute of Washington, D.C., Inc. v. Schweiker, </em>669 F.2d 812, 813-14 (D.C.Cir.1981) (per curiam)).<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Based on our own reading of the regulatory language, we conclude that the Secretary\u2019s apparent interpretations are plainly reasonable. In these circumstances, where there is no evidence that accepting the Secretary\u2019s interpretive expertise will actually \u201cshield an irrational decision-making process,\u201d <em>Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc. v. EPA, </em>790 F.2d 289, 298 (3d Cir.1986), or \u201cwork[] an unduly harsh result in the name of an otherwise valid and laudable regulation,\u201d <em>Hart v. Bowen, </em>799 F.2d 567, 570 (9th Cir.1986), there is no basis for second-guessing the agency. The district court therefore erred as a matter of law in replacing these interpretations, which are \u201ccompletely within the range of reasonable meanings [that] may logically ... be drawn from the words of the regulation[s],\u201d Gar<em>ner v. United States Office of Personnel Management, </em>633 F.Supp. 995, 999 (E.D.Pa.1986), with its own views.</p>\n<p id=\"b1277-9\">2. <em>Substantial Evidence Review</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1277-10\">We now address the question the district court did not reach:<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Was the PRRB\u2019s finding that the Monsour family and the Foundation \u2014 the seller and the buyer\u2014 were related parties at the time of the 1975 conversion<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> based on substantial evi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1194\">*1194</page-number>dence?<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> We answer this question unequivocally and in the affirmative.</p>\n<p id=\"b1278-4\">The Medicare statute defines related organizations in terms of \u201ccontrol,\u201d which \u201cexists where an individual or an organization has the power, directly <em>or indirectly, </em>significantly to influence or direct the actions or policies of an organization or institution.\u201d 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 405.427(b)(3) (1985) (emphasis added). Virtually all the factual evidence in the record before the PRRB establishes that the creation of the Foundation, the selection of its board members and trustees, and the financial transactions that effectuated the hospital conversion all proceeded according to the plans of, and were executed by, the members of the Monsour family who were the hospital\u2019s original (and only) stockholders. The record indicates that they planned a series of transactions that would produce for them financial benefits far exceeding the real value of the hospital they were selling to the Foundation.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> The record also indicates that the Monsour family members, after setting the terms of the conversion, expanded the Foundation they had created by adding eight new members appointed for the purpose of approving the conversion; in fact, while the four Monsours abstained from voting, this new, \u201cnon-Mons-our\u201d majority Foundation did approve every aspect of the proposed conversion. The record thus indicates that the conversion went exactly as the Monsour family members, as both the selling stockholders and the buying Foundation, had planned. Complicated organizational and financial structures simply cannot conceal or negate such substantial record evidence of the Monsours\u2019 direct power significantly to influence the actions or policies of the Foundation at the time of the conversion.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> While the substantial evidence just described is sufficient to demonstrate direct power to control, it in addition \u2014 and without question \u2014 demonstrates that the Mons-our family at least had the <em>indirect </em>power, referred to in the regulations, \u201csignificantly to influence or direct the actions or policies\u201d of the Foundation at the time of the conversion. 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 405.427(b)(3) (1985). The district court erred in finding otherwise. It looked only at events subsequent to the conversion, and it appears simply to have ignored the PRRB\u2019s finding that the precise facts of the conversion itself, because it was carried out as planned when the Monsours <em>were </em>the Foundation, were powerful and substantial evidence of the Monsour\u2019s continuing power to influence the Foundation at the time in question. We will therefore vacate the district court\u2019s summary judgment for the Center as to the conversion costs and order that the district court enter summary judgment for the Secretary on this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b1278-8\">3. <em>Collateral Estoppel</em></p>\n<p id=\"ATsc\">In the state court action involving Blue Cross and the Center, Judge Wekselman <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1195\">*1195</page-number>addressed appellant\u2019s claim \u201cthat evidence supports a finding that the conversion which occurred in May of 1975 was an arm\u2019s length transaction within the guidelines established by the Medicare regulations.\u201d <footnotemark>26</footnotemark> <em>Blue Cross of W. Pa. v. Monsour Medical Center, </em>No. GD 82-4968, at 7 (Pa.Ct. Common Pleas Feb. 2, 1983); Appellant\u2019s App. at A12. He found that,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1279-5\">[i]n essence, there is no evidence in this case from which the Court can find that the members of the two Boards were in any way beholding to the Monsours by virtue of prior social, business or family relationships with them, and the fact of such relationships is insufficient alone or in combination with any or all of the other evidence in the case to support a finding such as that contended for by Blue Cross.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1279-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 33; Appellant\u2019s App. at A38. Appellant, as cross-appellee on this issue, urges us, as it urged both the PRRB and the district court, to consider ourselves governed by this state court finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b1279-7\">While Blue Cross was a party to the state proceeding, the Secretary was not. Therefore, to estop the federal government from litigating its claims, appellant would have to prove that \u201cthe United States exercised control\u201d over Blue Cross\u2019s Pennsylvania court suit against the Center. <em>Montana v.

In <em>Montana, </em>where this question of control by the United States was not in dispute due to stipulations of the United States, <em>see id., </em>the Supreme Court based its finding that the United States had controlled the prior state suit, and thus was precluded from relitigating the issues that that state suit had settled, on the following indicia:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1279-12\">[t]he government ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1279-13\">(1) required the [state] lawsuit to be filed;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1279-14\">(2) reviewed and approved the complaint;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1279-15\">(3) paid the attorneys\u2019 fees and costs;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1279-16\">(4) directed the appeal from State District Court to the [State] Supreme Court;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1279-17\">(5) appeared and submitted a brief as <em>amicus </em>in the [State] Supreme Court;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1279-18\">(6) directed the filing of a notice of appeal to [the United States Supreme] Court; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1279-19\">(7) effectuated [the state court plaintiff\u2019s] abandonment of that appeal on advice of the Solicitor General.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1279-20\"><em>Id. </em>In the state suit that preceded this case, the Secretary played <em>none </em>of these controlling roles. The fact that she was sufficiently satisfied with the probative value of the state court proceeding to submit its transcript as evidence in the PRRB hearing does not, at least not without certain proof of the <em>Montana </em>indicia just enumerated, prove \u201cplainly [that the Secretary] had a sufficient \u2018laboring oar\u2019 in the conduct of state court litigation to actuate principles of estoppel.\u201d<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Drummond v. United States, </em>324 U.S. 316, 318, 65 S.Ct. 659, 660, 89 L.Ed. 969 (1945)). We therefore agree with the PRRB and the district court<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> that the state court find<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1196\">*1196</page-number>ings in the Blue Cross-Monsour Medical Center suit should not be given legally preclusive effect in this federal action.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1280-4\">4. <em>Equitable Estoppel</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1280-5\">Five years passed and actual reimbursement was paid for the Center\u2019s conversion costs before Blue Cross audited the Center\u2019s cost reports and retroactively disallowed these reimbursements. Appellant contends that the Secretary should therefore be equitably estopped from changing the original course of conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b1280-6\">Appellant has failed to carry its sizeable burden of proof on this issue.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> In <em>Heckler v. Community Health Services of Crawford County, Inc., </em>467 U.S. 51, 104 S.Ct. 2218, 81 L.Ed.2d 42 (1984) <em>if Crawford County\u2019\u2019), </em>the Supreme Court unanimously rejected a similar claim by a Medicare provider that had benefitted from excessive reimbursements provided by the Secretary\u2019s intermediary. Appellant has failed to demonstrate that the denial of reimbursement for the interest and depreciation costs associated with its conversion leaves it \u201csignificantly worse off than if it had never obtained\u201d such reimbursement in the first place. <em>Id. </em>at 63,104 S.Ct. at 2225. In fact, like the health care provider in <em>Crawford County, </em>the Center here has demonstrated no detriment other than its \u201cinability to retain money that [the Secretary has now determined] it should never have received in the first place.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 61, 104 S.Ct. at 2225. The core teaching of <em>Crawford County </em>is that, in the context \u201cof a complex program such as Medicare,\u201d it is simply too much to expect the Government \u201cto ensure that every bit of informal advice given by its agents ... will be sufficiently reliable to justify expenditure of sums of money as substantial as those spent by [appellant].\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 64, 104 S.Ct. at 2226. Adhering to that teaching, we find that equitable estoppel of the Secretary is not justified on the facts of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1280-10\">B. <em>Dietary Cost Reclassification</em></p>\n<p id=\"AmvA\">In its Medicare cost reports filed with Blue Cross for fiscal year 1980, the Mons-our Medical Center correctly treated its dietary costs (including its employee cafeteria) and its snack bar costs as separate \u201ccost centers.\u201d Appellant\u2019s cost report claimed the snack bar as a non-reimbursable cost center. Blue Cross subsequently audited the report and discovered that some nonreimbursable snack bar costs had been reported in the reimbursable die<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1197\">*1197</page-number>tary/cafeteria cost center. It thus reclassified those costs to the snack bar cost center (i.e., it refused to reimburse them). It also reopened the Center's cost reports for fiscal years 1977 through 1979 and adjusted them in the same way. Because the Center was unable to verify its claims that its original reports were accurate, Blue Cross made these adjustments in reliance on data provided by an outside contractor who had operated the cafeteria and had ordered, stored and assembled the food that was ultimately transferred to and served by the snack bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b1281-4\">The Center appealed these reclassification adjustments (approximately $318,000) to the PRRB, which found them to be appropriate. <em>Monsour Medical Center v. Blue Cross &amp; Blue Shield Ass\u2019n/Blue Cross of W. Pa., </em>PRRB Hearing Dec. No. 80-24, at 18 (June 14, 1984); Appellant\u2019s App. at A62. The Board found that the Center had failed \u201cto maintain verifiable and auditable financial records and statistical data to support [its] costs claimed,\u201d as required by 42 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 405.406 and 405.-453 (1985). <em>Id. </em>It therefore concluded that Blue Cross\u2019s resort to data furnished by the outside contractor was \u201creasonable and responsible[;] ... [it was] an acceptable alternative in view of the [Center\u2019s] deficient ... records.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The district court concluded that the Board\u2019s approval of the cost reclassifications was based upon substantial evidence,<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> and the Center now appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b1281-8\">We will affirm this portion of the district court\u2019s summary judgment order for appellee. The Center disputes the accuracy of the contractor\u2019s data, and it has urged this court to consider the Center\u2019s own study finding that snack bar meals in fact cost much less than Blue Cross\u2019s reclassification indicates, but it has offered no defense of its recordkeeping. Substantial evidence indicates that the Center\u2019s records for the years in question do not contain accurate data \u201cin sufficient detail\u201d to support its claims for dietary cost reimbursement. 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 405.453(c) (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b1281-9\">C. <em>Snack Bar Meal Costs</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1281-10\">Before the PRRB, the Center also challenged Blue Cross\u2019s refusal to reimburse its snack bar costs that relate to providing employee meals. The Board upheld this refusal, again basing its decision on the inadequacy of the Center\u2019s records to support its reimbursement claims.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1281-11\">We will affirm the district court\u2019s entry of summary judgment for the Secretary on this issue. We agree with the district court that the record before the Board \u201c[d]id not establish with the required degree of accuracy the snack bar costs attributable to employee meals during the years in question.\u201d<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> The Center must bear the cost of its failure to maintain the records required of a Medicare provider.</p>\n<p id=\"b1282-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1198\">*1198</page-number>CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1282-4\">On the conversion cost issue, we will vacate the district court\u2019s summary judgment for the Center and will direct the district court to enter summary judgment for the Secretary. On the dietary cost center and snack bar meal cost issues, we will affirm the district court\u2019s entry of summary judgment for the Secretary.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1271-15\">. <em>Monsour Medical Center v.

There is some dispute between the parties as to the precise value of the hospital at the time of the conversion. A 1974 appraisal, commissioned by the hospital, valued its assets at $18 million. In 1977, a second appraisal put a market value of $6,419,500 on the real estate holdings of the Monsour Medical Center as of May 21, 1975.

Appellant also contends that we are bound by the doctrine of <em>stare decisis </em>to respect the state court\u2019s determinations. Like the district court, we are not persuaded by this unusual assertion, for <em>stare decisis </em>concerns the deference and respect a given court must show <em>its own </em>prior decisions or those of its superior(s). <em>See, e.g., City of Akron v. Akron Center for Reproductive Health, Inc., </em>462 U.S. 416, 419-20 &amp; n. 1, 103 S.Ct. 2481, 2487 &amp; n. 1, 76 L.Ed.2d 687 (1983) (the Supreme Court demonstrating its respect for the doctrine by reaffirming <em>its </em>decision in <em>Roe v.

The district court did not analyze this issue independently. Instead, its opinion merged this question with the question whether the Center should be reimbursed for snack bar costs attributable to employee meals. We prefer to treat these questions separately, and have structured this opinion accordingly.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"32\">\n<p id=\"b1281-6\">. The Center did offer the Board a 1981 study of employee snack bar utilization, and urged the Board to use this study data to estimate unrecovered employee meal costs for the prior cost reporting periods at issue. As to 1981, the Board found that the Center\u2019s records were inadequate to corroborate the study's conclusion that 65 percent of the snack bar\u2019s activity related to employee utilization. The Board also found that \u2014 because snack bar revenue and cost statistics varied widely and without explanation from year to year, because the Center\u2019s snack bar records were commingled with those of its gift shop for all the years in question, and because 1981 was the first year in which cafeteria and snack bar services were combined after the services of the outside contractor were discontinued \u2014 there was no reasonable basis to extrapolate the findings of the 1981 study back to the prior years. <em>See Monsour Medical Center v.
