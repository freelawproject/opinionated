The Greater Boston Real Estate Board (GBREB), an organization which represents the interests of real estate brokers, filed a complaint in the single justice session requesting a declaration that the board\u2019s regulation, 254 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 2.05 (13) (1987),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> be declared to be beyond the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>board\u2019s authority and therefore void. The regulation describes the procedures which brokers <em>must </em>follow in the event that a dispute arises about a deposit held in escrow by a broker. A single justice of this court reserved and reported the case to this court on the complaint, answer, and statement of. agreed facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-4\">We summarize the agreed facts. Before the board issued its regulation, GBREB published and made available to real estate brokers and salesmen, and to buyers and sellers of real property, a form purchase and sales agreement. This standard form contained a clause stating that \u201c[a]ll deposits . . . shall be held in escrow by the Broker(s) and shall be duly accounted for at the time for performance . . . provided however that in the event of any disagreement the Broker(s). . . may retain said deposits pending instructions mutually given by the SELLER and the BUYER.\u201d The board became concerned about the propriety of this clause in the GBREB form agreement. The board also expressed general concern that brokers may be confused about the meaning of the statutory requirement that they remit deposits \u201cwithin a reasonable time.\u201d G. L. c. 112, \u00a7 87AAA <em>(d) </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>(1986 ed.).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In response to these concerns, the board unanimously approved 254 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 2.05 (13) after proper notice and public hearing. See note 2, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b376-5\">If valid, the regulation governs the resolution of deposit disputes between buyers and sellers<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> of real property in Massachusetts, \u201cnotwithstanding any agreement between the parties to the contrary.\u201d 254 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 2.05 (13)(a). If a dispute about money deposited with the broker arises between a buyer and seller and the broker is unable to determine to whom the money rightfully belongs, the broker must seek resolution of the dispute by the parties. <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 2.05 (13)(b)-(d)(1). If the parties fail to resolve the dispute within twenty-one days of the time the broker learned or should have learned of the dispute, \u201cthe broker shall file an action for interpleader,\u201d within thirty days of the original twenty-one days. <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 2.05 (13)(d)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b376-6\">The board\u2019s regulation contains no exception for cases in which the parties contractually agree to put the deposit in escrow and to designate the broker as the escrow holder. The board acknowledges, as it must, that the effect of the regulation is to discourage brokers from agreeing to act as an escrow holder for the buyer and seller if the parties decide to provide by contract a different mechanism for resolving possible disputes about deposits. If the broker becomes an escrow holder under such an agreement, the regulation mandates that the broker either violate his fiduciary responsibilities<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> under the agreement or face sanctions from the board. Such sanctions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>may include revocation of the broker\u2019s license. See note 3, <em>supra. </em>GBREB asserts that such a result is arbitrary, capricious, and beyond the board\u2019s authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-4\">\u201cAn agency\u2019s powers are shaped by its organic statute taken as a whole.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cerveny, </em>373 Mass. 345, 354 (1977). \u201cThe starting point of our analysis is the language of the statute, \u2018the principal source of insight into legislative purpose.\u2019\u201d <em>Simon </em>v. <em>State Examiners of Electricians, </em>395 Mass. 238, 242 (1985), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lightfoot, </em>391 Mass. 718, 720 (1984). General Laws c. 112, \u00a7 <em>87 AAA (d), </em>charges the board with the duty to ensure that brokers \u201cwithin a reasonable time\u201d remit funds that have come into their possession as brokers. See note 3, <em>supra. </em>Nevertheless, nothing in the statute precludes buyers and sellers, who are not subject to the board\u2019s jurisdiction, from themselves determining in an escrow agreement what shall constitute \u201ca reasonable time.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b377-5\">No provision in G. L. c. 112, \u00a7 87AAA, authorizes the board to forbid brokers from carrying out the terms of a lawful escrow agreement which does not violate either the obligations placed on brokers by the statutory scheme, professional responsibilities, or public policy. We discern nothing in the statute which can be read to authorize the promulgation of regulations restricting brokers from acting in accord with valid contractual obligations set by the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-6\">The board argues that, even if G. L. c. 112, \u00a7 87AAA <em>(d), </em>does not authorize the promulgation of the regulation, the board had authority to issue it under the general power to \u201cmake such rules and by-laws as it may deem necessary in the performance of its duties.\u201d G. L. c. 13, \u00a7 56 (1986 ed.). In light of its enabling statute, the board correctly notes that the issue is whether the powers granted by the Legislature to the board, taken as an organic whole, authorize the board\u2019s regulation. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cerveny, supra. </em>General Laws c. 13, \u00a7 56, allows the board to issue regulations to fulfil its duty to discipline brokers, which is described in G. L. c. 112, \u00a7\u00a7 87AAA-87BBB.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The statutory rulemaking authority of the board con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>ceming broker discipline is limited to the administration of these sections. See <em>Grocery Mfrs. of Am., Inc. </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Health, </em>379 Mass. 70, 75-76 &amp; n.5 (1979). In cases, such as this one, in which the enabling authority granted by the Legislature is narrow, \u201ccloser scrutiny of the authority of the agency is required.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 75.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-5\">Reading the sections of the statute concerning the board\u2019s duties in the most generous manner, we can discern only the purpose of ensuring that brokers be duly licensed and act legally and in a manner which comports with public policy.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The board is not authorized to mandate that, having agreed to act as an escrow holder under a contract, a broker must breach his fiduciary obligations and act in conformity with the board\u2019s regulation, rather than with the terms of the contract.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b378-6\">The case is remanded to the Supreme Judicial Court for the county of Suffolk for entry of a judgment declaring that 254 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 2.05 (13), is,void because the board lacked authority to issue it.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b374-16\"> Title 254 Code Mass.
