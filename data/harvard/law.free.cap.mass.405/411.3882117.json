In this appeal, which we transferred here on our own motion, we decide a somewhat similar case. This one involves not a fish bone in fish chowder served in a quaint restaurant on a wharf overlooking Boston Harbor, but rather a turkey bone in a bite-sized cube of white turkey meat ladled, along <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>with gravy and peas, onto a mound of mashed potatoes in a high school cafeteria in West Springfield. The plaintiff, a high school senior, bit into one of the turkey cubes, felt something in his throat, and after some effort expelled \u201ca small, <em>IV2 </em>inch hooked bone.\u201d He sustained injury to his esophagus and was hospitalized for four days.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-5\">The plaintiff argues that the judge, who heard the case without a jury, erred in deciding the breach of warranty claim against him because she applied the \u201cforeign substance-natural substance\u201d test rather than the consumer\u2019s \u201creasonable expectations\u201d test. When the foreign substance-natural substance test is applied, there is no liability as a matter of law for breach of warranty if the injury-causing substance is natural to the food, and liability is automatic if the offending item is foreign to the food. See <em>Mix </em>v. <em>Ingersoll Candy Co., 6 </em>Cal. 2d 674, 682 (1936); <em>Allen </em>v. <em>Grafton, </em>170 Ohio St. 249, 252-257 (1960), and cases cited; 3 R.A. Anderson, Uniform Commercial Code \u00a7 2-314:183 to \u00a7 2-314:185 (1983 &amp; Supp. 1988). The reasonable expectations test, on the other hand, considers whether the consumer reasonably should have expected to find the injury-causing substance in the food. See 3 A.M. Squillante &amp; J.R. Fonseca, S. Williston on Sales \u00a7 18-10, at 103 (4th ed. 1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b426-6\">The reasonable expectations test has been generally recognized as preferable to the foreign substance-natural substance test.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The foreign substance-natural substance test exonerates a seller of food from liability for the lack of fitness of the food for ordinary purposes simply because the injury causing sub<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>stance was natural to the food. It fails to focus the seller\u2019s attention on the consumer\u2019s reasonable beliefs and to recognize that sellers may fairly be held responsible in some instances for natural substances in food that cause injury. This court\u2019s discussion in its <em>Webster </em>opinion focused on the reasonable expectations of a consumer of fish chowder and concluded, as a matter of law, that bones in fish chowder should reasonably be expected. <em>Webster </em>v. <em>Blue Ship Tea Room, Inc., supra </em>at 426. In our view, the reasonable expectations test is the appropriate one to apply in determining liability for breach of warranty of merchantability under G.L. 106, \u00a7 2-314 (2) (c), by reason of a bone or other substance in food that caused harm to a consumer.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-5\">We turn to the judge\u2019s findings and rulings. The judge found that \u201c[t]he plaintiff reasonably expected that the turkey meat was boneless based on its being white meat, the fact that it was cut into bite size pieces and the manner in which it was served, i.e., ladled with gravy onto potatoes.\u201d She ruled as a matter of law, however, that the plaintiff had failed to prove that the defendant breached its warranty of merchantability. She noted that \u201c[t]he bone in the turkey was not a foreign substance and did not render the meal unwholesome,\u201d citing the <em>Webster </em>case. She ruled further that \u201c[t]he plaintiff as an ordinary consumer of the turkey meal should have reasonably expected the likelihood of a bone in the turkey meat,\u201d citing <em>Carl </em>v. <em>Dixie Co., </em>467 So.2d 960 (Ala. 1985).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b427-6\">We disagree with the plaintiff\u2019s claim that the judge decided the case against him solely on the ground that a turkey bone in a piece of turkey is not a foreign substance. Her discussion of reasonable expectations would have been unnecessary if she had decided the case by applying the foreign substance-natural substance test.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>The trial judge\u2019s finding of fact that the plaintiff reasonably expected that the turkey meat was boneless contrasts with tier ruling of law that an ordinary consumer of the turkey meal should have reasonably expected the likelihood of a bone in the turkey meat. The plaintiff\u2019s subjective expectations may not have been those of an ordinary objective consumer of the meal, and thus the judge\u2019s findings and rulings are not necessarily inconsistent. Her citation to the <em>Carl </em>case suggests that she may have made this distinction. On the other hand, the reasons she provided for the reasonableness of the plaintiff\u2019s expectation that there would be no bones (the bite size pieces of only white meat served on top of mashed potatoes) seem to be objective, and not subjective, criteria.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-4\">The plaintiff is entitled to a clarification of the judge\u2019s findings of fact and rulings of law. Although we recognize that in particular circumstances no consumer could reasonably expect not to find the injury-causing object and thus a directed verdict for a defendant would be proper, on the facts found in this case, the defendant was not entitled to prevail as a matter of law. The answer depends on what the reasonable expectations of an ordinary high school student would be concerning the likely presence of a bone in this meal.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> As the trier of fact, the judge has not made and should make a finding on that dispositive question.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-5\">The judgment is vacated, and the case is remanded to the Superior Court for further consideration consistent with this opinion.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b428-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b426-7\"> See, e.g., <em>Yong Cha Hong </em>v. <em>Marriott Corp., </em>656 F.

She was injured by what she thought was a bone. Her dentist had removed the offending object but had not saved it. The court denied recovery, holding, as a matter of law, that a consumer should have reasonably expected to find a bone, even if the plaintiff herself did not.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b428-7\"> The pertinent reasonable expectations are those of the ordinary purchaser of the type who purchases the product in question. See Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 402A comment i (1965). In particular circumstances, the special knowledge and experience of a plaintiff may have a bearing on the reasonableness of his expectations and his right to recover.
