See G. L. c. 233, \u00a7\u00a7 20C-20H (1986 ed.).</p>\n<p id=\"b140-5\">The questions come to us on a statement of agreed facts which we summarize. The witness, who was summoned before a grand jury that was investigating alleged violations of the conflict of interest and extortion statutes, validly claimed his privilege against self-incrimination. On application of the Attorney General, a single justice of this court issued an order granting immunity to the witness.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The witness appeared with counsel before the grand jury, answered certain questions but declined to answer others, asserting his privilege against self-incrimination expressed in the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution and in art. 12 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-6\">The Attorney General then initiated contempt proceedings in the Superior Court. The witness challenged the jurisdiction of the court, claiming that such a contempt proceeding could only be brought before a single justice of the Supreme Judicial Court. The first reported question concerns this issue. The witness also argued that, in commencing the contempt proceeding, the Attorney General should have followed the complaint procedure prescribed by Mass. R. Civ. P. 65.3, as appearing in 386 Mass. 1244 (1982), but that he had not done so. The second reported question concerns this issue. The witness argued further that, in any event, the immunity he was granted did not protect him from self-incrimination if he were to answer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>the questions that he declined to answer before the grand jury. The Superior Court judge accepted the witness\u2019s argument that immunity set forth in G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 20G, was not as broad as it should be in order to protect the witness\u2019s State constitutional rights. The judge concluded that the grant of immunity did not include immunity from prosecution for a crime not listed in G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 20D. The third issue we discuss involves the scope of the immunity granted to the witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-6\">We allowed the parties\u2019 joint application for direct appellate review. We conclude that the question of the witness\u2019s contempt of court was properly before the Superior Court judge and that the immunity granted to the witness fully protected his constitutional rights against self-incrimination.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-7\">1. The first reported question asks whether the Superior Court judge was correct in rejecting the witness\u2019s claim that the contempt proceeding should have been brought in the Supreme Judicial Court for the county of Suffolk.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We answer in the affirmative.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-8\">Section 20H of G. L. c. 233 provides that if a witness, immunized by a Justice of this court, thereafter refuses to testify, contempt proceedings should be brought \u201cin the court where the alleged contempt occurred.\" The statute says that the proceeding should be brought where the alleged contempt was committed; it does not say that the proceeding should be brought in the court whose order the witness allegedly failed to carry out. An immunized witness\u2019s refusal to testify before a grand jury sitting in a county of this State is more nearly a contempt committed in the Superior Court of that county than it is a contempt committed in the single justice session of this court. See Mass. R. Crim. P. 5 (a) and (h), 378 Mass. 850 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b142-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>The statute is admittedly ambiguous on this point. We elect an interpretation that produces the more practical result, leaving the administration of an immunity order to a judge in the county where the grand jury is sitting. We recently said that \u201ca contempt proceeding <em>initiated in the Superior Court </em>pursuant to \u00a7 20H will normally be the proper procedure to follow when an immunized witness refuses to testify\u201d (emphasis supplied). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Steinberg, </em>404 Mass. 602, 608 (1989). See <em>Ward </em>v. <em>Coletti, </em>383 Mass. 99, 109 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b142-5\">2. The judge was correct in declining to dismiss the contempt proceeding in response to the witness\u2019s claim that the Commonwealth should have filed a complaint pursuant to Mass. R. Civ. P. 65.3. We, therefore, answer the second question in the affirmative.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> As the language just quoted from our opinion in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Steinberg </em>indicates, a contempt arising out of the violation of a \u00a7 20E immunity order is governed by \u00a7 20H. The immunity order issued by the single justice of this court was not a court order to which rule 65.3 applies. See rule 65.3 (a). Rule 65.3 (b) contemplates that there would be a \u201ccivil action out of which the contempt arose.\u201d There is no underlying civil action in the rule 65.3 sense involved in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-6\">3. The third issue concerns the scope of the immunity granted by an order of the single justice.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The question is whether the judge below was \u201ccorrect in deciding that the scope of immunity granted to the witness pursuant to [\u00a7 20G] is limited only to transactional immunity for crimes enumerated in the order of immunity.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AJa\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>When a single justice orders a witness to testify before a grand jury concerning the grand jury \u2019 s investigation of a crime or crimes listed in \u00a7 20D, the immunity granted is transactional immunity, immunity from prosecution for offenses to which the compelled testimony relates. See <em>Kastigar </em>v. <em>United States, </em>406 U.S. 441, 443 (1972). The crimes as to which a witness is thus immunized are not only those crimes listed in \u00a7 20D but also any crime related to a transaction about which the witness is compelled to testify. Cf. <em>In re Vericker, </em>446 F.2d 244, 247 (2d Cir. 1971) (immunity extends to testimony conceming offenses not themselves grounds for grant of immunity). We have characterized \u00a7 20G immunity as a grant of transactional immunity. See <em>Attorney Gen. </em>v. <em>Colleton, </em>387 Mass. 790, 797 n.8 (1982). Any contrary construction of G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 20G, and related sections, would make the immunity statute ineffective, because the immunity granted would not be coextensive with the witness\u2019s art. 12 right against self-incrimination. <em>See Attorney Gen. </em>v. <em>Colleton, supra </em>at 799, 801; <em>Emery\u2019s Case, </em>107 Mass. 172, 181-182 (1871).</p>\n<p id=\"Auf\">An immunized witness may not be prosecuted if his compelled testimony implicates him in any crime regardless of whether that crime is referred to in \u00a7 20D or in the order granting immunity. Thus, it makes no difference that crimes such as compounding a felony (G. L. c. 268, \u00a7 3 [1986 ed.j), and tax fraud (G. L. c. 59, \u00a7 91 [1986 ed.]), are not listed in \u00a7 20D or that testimony sought from a witness might furnish a link in the chain of evidence needed to prosecute a witness for such a non-\u00a7 20D crime (see <em>Taylor </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>369 Mass. 183, 187-188 [1975]). The witness\u2019s immunity is complete as to any compelled testimony without regard to whether an arguably relevant crime is listed in \u00a7 20D.</p>\n<p id=\"AGU\">The answer we give is not one that careful counsel could have anticipated with full confidence. The Attorney General came to the same conclusion only at the time he filed his reply brief in this court. Moreover, opinions of this court could be read as creating some doubt about the scope of the immunity that a single justice of this court is authorized to grant. There is a statement in <em>Grand Jurors for Middlesex County for the </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number><em>Year 1974 </em>v. <em>Wallace, </em>369 Mass. 876, 880 (1976), that \u201cas to crimes not specified [in \u00a7 20D], no immunity shall be granted,\u201d but that statement concerned only the absence of a right to make any grant of immunity in investigations of non- \u00a7 20D crimes. Likewise, discussion of the limitation on the examination of an immunized witness in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Donahue, </em>369 Mass. 943 , 950-951, cert. denied, 429 U.S. 833 (1976), could be read as suggesting that an immunized witness might somehow incriminate himself in his trial testimony. The court was not saying, nor was the defendant arguing, however, that the witness\u2019s immunity extended only to \u00a7 20D crimes. See <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>386 Mass. 345, 348 (1982), where the court did not reach the argument that an immunized witness, allegedly a minor, was not adequately immunized because delinquency charges are not mentioned in \u00a7 20D.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-19\">Whatever doubts there may have been about the scope of \u00a7 20G immunity are not resolved. The transactional immunity granted by \u00a7 20G is stated in language substantially similar to that considered in <em>Cabot v. Corcoran, </em>332 Mass. 44, 46 (1954), which this court said \u201cwas designed to grant an immunity as broad in all respects as the [art. 12] privilege, and it should be so construed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 52. We also said that \u201c[i]t would be difficult to imagine an immunity more complete.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 51. We do not see in the expression of use immunity in \u00a7 20G (in addition to transactional immunity) any narrowing of the broad scope of the language interpreted in the <em>Cabot </em>case and set forth in much the same words in \u00a7 20G.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-26\">4. We answer questions one and two, \u201cyes.\u201d Our discussion of the issues of continuing importance under question three adequately advises the witness and the judge concerning the scope of the witness\u2019s immunity.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b140-7\"> The significant portion of the order reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b140-8\">\u201cThat the witness, . , give testimony before the Middlesex County Grand Jury regarding the investigation of alleged violations of the conflict of interest and the extortion statutes by various Middlesex County Deputy Sheriffs and the Middlesex County Sheriff. It is further ordered that upon so testifying, the witness, . . ., shall have personal immunity and shall not be prosecuted or subjected to a penalty or forfeiture with respect to the transactions, matters and things about which he is compelled to testify, except for perjury committed while giving testimony, or otherwise failing to comply with this order.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b141-9\"> The full question is:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b141-10\">\u201cWas the Court correct in denying the motion of the witness to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction which motion asserted that the Supreme Judicial Court is the exclusive forum for the institution of contempt proceedings for violation of an immunity order issued by a Single Justice of the Supreme Judicial Court pursuant to M.G.L. c. 233, \u00a7 20E?\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b142-7\"> The second question is:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b142-8\">\u201cWas the Court correct in denying the motion of the witness to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction which motion was based on the failure of the Commonwealth to file a complaint pursuant to Mass. R. Civ. P. 65.3?\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b142-9\"> \u201cThe \u201cquestion\u201d reported consists of three questions. One question concerns a position that the Commonwealth took at the outset of this case on the scope of such an immunity order but has now abandoned. We need answer neither that question nor whether the scope of immunity that the Commonwealth previously claimed was granted by G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 20G, would satisfy art. 12 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
