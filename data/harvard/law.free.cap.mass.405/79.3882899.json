(Roslindale), applied to the police commissioner of Boston (commissioner) for renewal of its class 2<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> license to buy and sell used motor vehicles for the year 1987. G. L. c. 140, \u00a7 59 (1986 ed.). The commissioner, acting through Sergeant Robert Scobie (Scobie), the commanding officer of the Boston police . department licensing unit, denied Roslindale\u2019s application. Although G. L. c. 140, \u00a7 59, provides for an appeal to the Superior Court, Roslindale filed a complaint in the nature of mandamus, see G. L. c. 249, \u00a7 5 (1986 ed.), asking that the commissioner be ordered to issue an application for renewal of its license and to act promptly on receipt of Roslindale\u2019s renewal application. See <em>infra </em>at 85 &amp; n.9. After a jury-waived trial, a judge in the Superior Court reversed the commissioner\u2019s decision, and ordered the commissioner to grant Roslindale\u2019s request for renewal of its license. The commissioner appealed. The judgment was stayed pending appeal.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We transferred the case to this court on our own motion. For the reasons stated in this opinion, we reverse the judgment of the Superior Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-19\">Roslindale, a corporation with a place of business at 530 American Legion Highway in the Roslindale section of B oston, held a license to buy and sell used motor vehicles at 530 American Legion Highway from 1969 until 1986.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Francis J. Devine is Roslindale\u2019s president and treasurer. On January 13, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>1987, the commissioner through Scobie rejected Roslindale\u2019s application for a license to buy and sell used motor vehicles pursuant to G. L. c. 140, \u00a7 59, stating that Devine was not a \u201csuitable person\u201d to hold such a license.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AU9\">At the jury-waived trial in the Superior Court, Roslindale offered the opinions of two witnesses<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> that Devine is a proper person to hold such a license, and that Roslindale\u2019s American Legion Highway location is a suitable space for dealing in used motor vehicles. The evidence indicates that prior to October, 1986, the Boston police department had received no complaint of improper or unsuitable conduct of Roslindale at its American Legion Highway location.</p>\n<p id=\"AkV\">Scobie, the commissioner\u2019s agent, testified that he based his conclusion that Devine was not a \u201csuitable person\u201d on the commissioner\u2019s knowledge of an investigation commenced by the division of professional standards of the Boston police department relating to another of Roslindale\u2019s business locations. In addition, Scobie knew that the records of the American Legion Highway location were being reviewed as part of an ongoing investigation into alleged criminal activity by Roslindale. After reviewing the commissioner\u2019s decision and the evidence presented, the judge reversed the commissioner\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"Aeq\">We turn to the proper interpretation of the statute. General Laws c. 140, \u00a7 59, provides: \u201cThe police commissioner in Boston and the licensing authorities in other cities and towns may grant licenses [to sell used motor vehicles] under this section which shall expire on January first following the date of issue unless sooner revoked. ... No such license shall be granted unless the licensing board or officer is satisfied from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>an investigation of the facts stated in the application and any other information which they may require of the applicant, that he is a proper person to engage in the business . . . that said business is or will be his principal business, and that he has available a place of business suitable for the purpose.\u201d The statute does not provide for a hearing before the commissioner in such a case. However, in the case of revocation of an existing license, the license \u201cshall be revoked by the licensing board or officer if it appears, <em>after hearing, </em>that the licensee is not complying with sections fifty-seven to sixty-nine, inclusive, or the rules and regulations made thereunder\u201d (emphasis supplied). <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b96-5\">Roslindale argues that failure to renew a license is more like revocation than refusal to issue a new license, and, therefore, the statute requires that Roslindale be afforded a hearing on its application. We do not agree. The statute provides explicitly that a license expires at the end of one year. There is no special procedure for renewal; the applicant applies in the same manner as a first-time applicant. Roslindale \u201chad no right to a renewal of a license. ... [It was] entitled only to fair treatment.\u201d <em>Liggett Drug Co. </em>v. <em>License Comm\u2019rs of N. Adams, </em>296 Mass. 41, 52-53 (1936). See 3 C. Sands &amp; M. Libonati, Local Government Law \u00a7 15.39, at 15-136 (1982) (\u201cthe licensee\u2019s expectations of regular renewal do not give rise to vested rights in continued licensure\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b96-6\">Roslindale next argues that, even if the terms of the statute do not grant it a right to a hearing, we must infer one in order to afford Roslindale due process of law. Again, we disagree. Due process requirements are implicated when licensing decisions affect a property interest. See <em>Regents of State Colleges </em>v. <em>Roth, </em>408 U.S. 564, 569-570 (1972). To have a property interest in a license, an applicant must \u201chave a legitimate claim of entitlement to it.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 577. Under Massachusetts law, applicants for a license to deal in used motor vehicles do not have a claim of entitlement to such a license. The statute, which states that the commissioner \u201cmay\u201d grant a license to a proper person, gives broad discretion to the commissioner in granting licenses. See <em>Turnpike Amusement Park, Inc. </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number><em>Licensing Comm\u2019n of Cambridge, </em>343 Mass. 435, 437-438 (1962). The more discretion granted a governmental body in licensing, the less likely it is that citizens have a property interest in obtaining a license. See <em>O\u2019Neill </em>v. <em>Nantucket, </em>545 F. Supp. 449, 453 (D. Mass. 1982), aff\u2019d, 711 F.2d 469 (1st Cir. 1983). \u201cIn a case such as the present where the Commonwealth has a strong interest in regulating an occupation in order to protect the public and where that occupation is not one in which the individual affected has a substantial vested interest, the licensing procedure is wholly discretionary, and there is no constitutional right to a hearing.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gordon, </em>354 Mass. 722, 726 (1968). See <em>Papa Gino\u2019s of Am., Inc. </em>v. <em>Taurasi, </em>616 F. Supp. 77, 79 (D. Mass. 1984), aff\u2019d, 760 F.2d 251 (1st Cir. 1985) (under Massachusetts law, applicants for a common victuallers license have no property interest in obtaining license).</p>\n<p id=\"b97-5\">Although we agree with the commissioner that under the statute an applicant for renewal of a license to deal in used motor vehicles is not entitled to an evidentiary hearing before him, we conclude that, as a matter of fundamental fairness, an applicant for the renewal of a license, especially one who has had a license for a number of years, is entitled to a specific statement by the commissioner setting forth the reason or reasons for his decision not to renew the license. A person who for a number of years has been designated as a \u201cproper person\u201d to operate such a business is entitled to be informed whether the commissioner has decided not to renew the license because the applicant is no longer a proper person, and why; or whether the commissioner has decided in his discretion to deny the license for some other reason.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The statute confers on the commissioner a \u201cquasi judicial authority to determine the facts and to pass upon the application in each instance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>under the serious sense of responsibility imposed upon [him] by [his] official position[ ] and the delicate character of the duty entrusted to [him].\u201d <em>Mosey Cafe </em>v. <em>Licensing Bd. for Boston, </em>338 Mass. 199, 205 (1958), quoting <em>Butler </em>v. <em>East Bridgewater, </em>330 Mass. 33, 37 (1953). See <em>Caswell </em>v. <em>Licensing Comm\u2019n for Brockton, </em>387 Mass. 864, 873-875 (1983). Therefore, the commissioner should state the reason or reasons for his decision to deny the application for renewal of a license. Such a requirement emphasizes the seriousness of such a decision and also permits the applicant to make a meaningful and focused appeal to the Superior Court under G. L. c. 140, \u00a7 59. See, e.g., <em>Yerardi\u2019s Moody St. Restaurant &amp; Lounge, Inc. </em>v. <em>Selectmen of Randolph, 19 </em>Mass. App. Ct. 296, 304 (1985). See also <em>Forsyth School for Dental Hygienists </em>v. <em>Board of Registration in Dentistry, </em>404 Mass. 211, 219 n.3 (1989); <em>Eastern Scrap Servs., Inc. </em>v. <em>Harty, </em>115 R.I. 260, 263 (1975). Because the commissioner did not set forth the reasons for his denial of Roslindale\u2019s renewal application, the judge correctly reversed the commissioner\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-5\">In cases in which a particular statute did not explicitly provide for an appeal from the denial of a license, we have held that the proper standard of review is the \u201carbitrary or capricious\u201d standard. See <em>Caswell </em>v. <em>Licensing Comm\u2019n for Brockton, </em>387 Mass. 864, 878 (1983) (action in the nature of certiorari); <em>Bennett </em>v. <em>Aldermen of Chelsea, </em>361 Mass. 802, 807 (1972) (petition for writ of certiorari). Like those statutes, G. L. c. 140, \u00a7 59, \u201cdoes not contain narrow and objective criteria to be applied by authorities in evaluating license applications.... We conclude that, in an action for judicial review of a local licensing authority\u2019s denial of [a renewal] application for a license under G. L. c. 140, \u00a7 [59] ... the appropriate standard of review is error of law or abuse of discretion, as measured by the \u2018arbitraiy or capricious\u2019 test.\u201d <em>Caswell </em>v. <em>Licensing Comm\u2019n for Brockton, supra </em>at 878. See <em>Mosey Cafe, Inc. </em>v. <em>Licensing Bd. for Boston, </em>338 Mass. 199, 205 (1958). See also <em>Chief of Police of Shelburne </em>v. <em>Moyer, </em>16 Mass. App. Ct. 543, 546 (1983).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b99-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>seeking relief from the courts through judicial review, Roslindale filed a complaint in the nature of mandamus. G. L. c. 249, \u00a7 5. Roslindale should have brought its complaint under G. L. c. 140, \u00a7 59, which provides that \u201c[a]ny person aggrieved by any action of the . . . officer refusing to grant ... a license for any cause may . . . appeal therefrom to any justice of the superior court in the county in which the premises ... are located.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Further, a complaint in the nature of mandamus is inappropriate because \u201c[i]t is well settled that the relief provided in the nature of mandamus does not lie to compel the municipal officer to exercise his or her judgment or discretion in a particular way.\u201d <em>Urban Transp., Inc. </em>v. <em>Mayor of Boston, </em>373 Mass. 693, 698 (1977), and cases cited. Because the commissioner\u2019s decision requires the exercise of his discretion, the judge should not have ordered the commissioner \u201cforthwith [to] grant Roslindale a . . . license for its premises at 530 American Legion Highway.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b99-8\">The judgment is reversed, and the case remanded to the Superior Court, there to be returned to the commissioner to set forth his reason or reasons for the denial of the renewal application, and for such further proceedings consistent with this opinion as may be necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-9\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b94-24\"> A class 2 license is a license held by a person \u201cwhose principal business is the buying or selling of second hand motor vehicles.\u201d G.

G. L. c. 140, \u00a7 59.
