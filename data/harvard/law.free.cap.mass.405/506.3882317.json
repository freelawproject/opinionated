L. c. 93A (1986 ed.). The gist of the complaint is that the defendants concurrently represented the conflicting interests of Paragon and Emanuel Gross (Gross), Paragon\u2019s other fifty per cent shareholder, to the detriment of the plaintiff\u2019s interests, that they accepted fees from Paragon for services rendered to Gross in opposition to the plaintiff, that they failed to disclose to the plaintiff facts that were material to her interests, and that they helped Gross in his attempts to \u201csqueeze out\u201d the plaintiff from Paragon.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-5\">After trial, and following the judge\u2019s denial of the defendants\u2019 directed verdict motions, the judge submitted a series of questions relative to the plaintiff\u2019s common law claims to the jury for their special verdicts under Mass. R. Civ. P. 49 (a), 365 Mass. 812 (1974). There is no indication in the record that the plaintiff objected to the questions as inaccurately reflecting her claims, and she does not make that assertion on appeal. The questions and the jury\u2019s answers were as follows: \u201c(1) Did the law firm of Cohen, Rosenthal, Price, Mirkin, Jennings and Berg, P.C. undertake or continue to simultaneously represent both the defendant Emanuel Gross and Paragon Rubber Corporation in a derivative action brought against them by the plaintiff, Arline Schaeffer, when it knew or should have known that such multiple employment would be likely to involve it in representing differing interests?\u201d The jury answered, \u201cyes.\u201d \u201c(2) If the answer to Question (1) is YES, did said law firm accept compensation from Paragon Rubber Corporation for legal services performed by it in the defense of that civil action when it knew or should have known that such multiple employment would be likely to involve it in representing differing interests?\u201d The jury again answered, \u201cyes.\u201d \u201c(3) If the answer to Question (2) is YES, what was the amount of such compensation?\u201d The jury found that the amount of compensation obtained was $63,074. \u201c(4) In any matters or controversies in which the defendants represented Paragon Rubber Corporation, did the defendants fail to represent Paragon Rubber Company in accordance with good legal practice? The jury\u2019s answer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>was, \u201cyes.\u201d \u201c(5) If the answer to Question (4) is YES, was such failure on the part of the defendants a proximate cause of any financial loss by Paragon Rubber Corporation?\u201d Again, the jury answered, \u201cyes.\u201d \u201c(6) If the answer to Question (5) is YES, what was the amount of such financial loss?\u201d The jury found $77,624 as the amount of the loss Paragon sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-5\">Following the special verdicts, the judge considered a motion submitted by the defendants for judgment notwithstanding the verdicts as to the common law claims. He also addressed the factual and legal questions bearing on the G. L. c. 93A claim which had not been submitted to the jury. The judge set forth in a memorandum in considerable detail his findings, rulings, and order for judgment. According to his findings, this case arose out of a controversy between the plaintiff and Gross over the ownership and management of Paragon. Paragon is a closely held Massachusetts corporation founded in order to continue a business begun by the plaintiff\u2019s father-in-law, Edward Schaeffer. When Schaeffer died in 1962, he left the business in trust for the plaintiff\u2019s late husband and their children. When the plaintiff\u2019s husband died, in 1964, the trustees put the business up for sale. Gross, who was then married to the plaintiff\u2019s sister, proposed that he and the plaintiff purchase and jointly own the business. Gross offered to contribute $100,000 in cash and to finance the remainder of the price with a mortgage on the business\u2019s real estate. He and the plaintiff would have equal ownership Of the business and real estate, and the plaintiff would repay him $50,000 out of a salary that the business would pay her.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-6\">The plaintiff and Gross enlisted the defendant Irving M. Cohen\u2019s legal assistance. Cohen formed Paragon as a corporation to own the non-real estate assets of the business. Fifty per cent of the corporate stock was assigned to the plaintiff, who was named vice president and chairman of the board of directors. The other fifty per cent was assigned to Gross, who was named president and treasurer. The real estate was conveyed to Gross and the plaintiff as tenants in common.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-7\">From the outset, Gross managed Paragon\u2019s business. The plaintiff was paid a \u201csalary\u201d by the corporation which was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>applied against her loan debt, but she did not perform any real services. Cohen represented both the plaintiff and Gross in the formation of Paragon. Gross subsequently retained Cohen as corporate counsel for Paragon without objection by the plaintiff. Cohen also handled Gross\u2019s personal legal matters from time to time. Cohen remained friendly with the plaintiff for at least ten years, and also represented her in the sale of her house in 1978.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-5\">Some time in the mid-1970\u2019s, it was revealed that Gross had been selling scrap metal owned by the corporation and retaining the proceeds. Gross contended that he used the money to pay kickbacks to purchasing agents of Paragon\u2019s customers. Gross was indicted for income tax evasion and Paragon also faced difficulties with the Internal Revenue Service. Cohen and his law firm declined to represent Gross and Paragon in this matter because they lacked expertise in the subject. Instead, they referred the matter to another firm. According to the judge\u2019s findings, \u201c[Cohen\u2019s] lack of expertise, however, did not deter Cohen from accepting a 3310% referral fee . . . even though he knew or should have known that the fees were being paid by Paragon. By the time the matter was concluded, that referral fee amounted to $4,850.00.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b523-7\">As a result of the Internal Revenue Service audit, Paragon discontinued paying the plaintiff\u2019s salary. In order to replace at least part of her income, the plaintiff and Gross arranged to increase the rent which Paragon was paying on the real estate. After a period of time, however, Gross discontinued rental payments. The plaintiff then retained her own counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-8\">According to the judge\u2019s findings, \u201c[f]rom at least that point onward, the positions of Gross and the plaintiff with regard to the corporation were adversary and antagonistic. . . . Also from that time onward, however, the plaintiff was at all times represented by her own counsel in all matters pertaining to Paragon. Cohen continued to serve as corporate counsel for Paragon, and he also continued to serve as Gross\u2019s personal attorney.\u201d For the next several years, the plaintiff and Gross had serious disagreements concerning the payment of dividends and rent. \u201cThe parties could agree on little or nothing\u201d concerning Paragon and its affairs.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>The judge\u2019s findings continue: \u201cA meeting of stockholders and directors was held on June 22, 1981, at the behest of the plaintiff for the purpose of considering a proposed discharge of Gross as president and treasurer of the corporation and a proposed sale of the business. . . . Cohen did not attend that meeting but he sent a member of his law firm, the defendant Arthur W. Price. . . . Price ostensibly attended the meeting as corporate counsel, but, I am convinced, he was there to protect the interests of Gross as well.\u201d Price refused to agree to the plaintiff\u2019s demand that Gross reveal details of the kickback scheme in which he alleged he had participated. All votes taken at that meeting ended in a tie, and nothing was accomplished.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-4\">On February 9, 1982, the plaintiff commenced a shareholder\u2019s derivative suit on behalf of Paragon against Gross and another corporate employee alleging that Gross had taken excess salary from Paragon and had otherwise caused corporate assets to be diverted to himself and his family. A member of the defendant law firm filed an appearance on behalf of both Gross and Paragon and an answer on behalf of Gross. In response, the plaintiff\u2019s attorney filed, and the court allowed, a motion to require the defendant law firm to withdraw its appearance as either counsel for Gross or for Paragon. \u201cDespite the allowance of that motion, the defendant filed no disappearance on behalf of either Gross or Paragon, and it continued to bill Paragon for all services rendered by it in the derivative action. \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b524-5\">On February 14, 1983, according to the findings, while the derivative action was pending, the plaintiff filed a petition for dissolution of Paragon and its wholly owned subsidiary. The defendant law firm appeared on behalf of Gross in opposition to that petition. In September, 1983, counsel for the plaintiff again filed a motion seeking to disqualify the defendant firm from representing both Gross and Paragon in the pending litigation. The defendants vigorously resisted the motion at a hearing, but soon thereafter withdrew as counsel for both Gross and Paragon.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-6\">The judge found that the derivative action, the petition for dissolution, and an action commenced by the plaintiff in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>District Court to obtain an accounting of rents from the real estate were settled in January, 1984. By the terms of the settlement, the plaintiff transferred her entire interest in Paragon and the real estate it occupied to Gross in exchange for $1,050,000. The derivative action, the petition for dissolution, and the action for an accounting were dismissed with prejudice pursuant to the parties\u2019 stipulation, and the plaintiff and Gross exchanged mutual releases. The plaintiff, however, reserved from her release any causes of action that she might have against Cohen or his law firm. By the time of that settlement, the plaintiff had paid the lawyers who were then representing her $115,000 in fees and expenses. That was in addition to \u201csubstantial fees and expenses\u201d she had previously paid to other counsel for services related to the same matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-5\">Meanwhile, the present action was commenced on December 2, 1983. Originally it was an action on behalf of the plaintiff personally and also a derivative action on behalf of Paragon. After the actions against Gross were settled, however, the plaintiff eliminated from her complaint all derivative claims on behalf of Paragon. After reciting his findings, which we have substantially repeated, the judge in his memorandum turned to the questions raised by the defendants \u2019 directed verdict motions and their motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdicts, namely, whether the evidence was sufficient to warrant the jury\u2019s special verdicts. See <em>D\u2019Annolfo </em>v. <em>Stoneham Hous. </em>Auth., 375 Mass. 650, 657 (1978). The judge concluded, correctly, in our view, that there was ample evidence to support the jury\u2019s findings. The evidence showed, as the judge\u2019s memorandum stated, that \u201cthe interests which the plaintiff sought to assert on behalf of Paragon [in the derivative action against Gross] and the interests of Gross were diverse and conflicting. The jury were warranted in finding that in undertaking and continuing the dual representation, the defendants failed to represent Paragon in accordance with good legal practice.\u201d The judge also correctly concluded that, in other particulars, which we need not repeat, the evidence warranted all the jury\u2019s answers.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>Nonetheless, the judge concluded that \u201c[t]he problem with the plaintiff\u2019s case is that she lacks standing to maintain it.\u201d The judge reasoned that, with respect to corporation (Paragon) matters, there was no attorney-client relationship between the plaintiff and the defendants. He expressly recognized that \u201cParagon was a closely held corporation, and by virtue of that fact the plaintiff and Gross owed to each other the rigorous fiduciary duty of partners and participants in a joint venture\u201d as articulated in <em>Donahue </em>v. <em>Rodd Electrotype Co., </em>367 Mass. 578, 593 (1975). See <em>Wilkes </em>v. <em>Springside Nursing Home, Inc., </em>370 Mass. 842, 848 (1976). The judge also recognized that \u201c[i]t can be argued as a logical corollary to that principle that an attorney or law firm undertaking to act as corporate counsel to such a corporation assumes the duties of attorney for each of the principal stockholders in all matters in which he (or it) acts for or on behalf of the corporation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b526-4\">Despite those observations, however, the judge noted his lack of awareness \u201cof any case in which it has been held that corporate counsel for a closely held corporation owes a duty to tihe individual stockholders of that corporation.\u201d He commented also that \u201cit seems to be established that even in the case of a closely held corporation an action for recovery of an excessive salary paid to a corporate officer by the corporation can only be recovered in a derivative action brought on behalf of the corporation. <em>Bessette </em>v. <em>Bessette, </em>385 Mass. 806 . . . (1982). In <em>Bessette, </em>the court said that the fiduciary duty on which the claim was based was owed to the corporation and not to the individual stockholders, so it could only be asserted as a stockholders\u2019 derivative action.\u201d The judge concluded that the jury\u2019s special verdicts established only that the defendants had violated duties they owed to Paragon, not to the plaintiff, and that, as a consequence, \u201cthe cause of action resulting from that [violation] only could be asserted as a derivative action on behalf of Paragon. . . . When the plaintiff ceased to be a stockholder as a result of the settlement of the various actions against Gross, she lost her standing to maintain a derivative action. She so acknowledged when she filed her . . . amended <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>complaint.\u201d \u201cIt follows,\u201d said the judge, \u201cthat despite the verdict of the jury in answer to special questions, judgment must be entered for the defendants on the first four counts of the complaint [the common law claims].\u201d The plaintiff appealed, and we transferred the case to this court on our own initiative.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-5\">Indeed, there is logic in the proposition that, even though counsel for a closely held corporation does not by virtue of that relationship alone have an attorney-client relationship with the individual shareholders, counsel nevertheless owes each shareholder a fiduciary duty. See <em>Fasschi </em>v. <em>Sommers, Schwartz, Silver &amp; Tyler, P.C., </em>107 Mich. App. 509 (1981), for a well-reasoned opinion supporting that view. Just as an attorney for a partnership owes a fiduciary duty to each partner, it is fairly arguable that an attorney for a close corporation owes a fiduciary duty to the individual shareholders. However, it is not necessary for us to resolve the question whether such a duty is owed in order to decide this case. Even if we were to recognize such a duty, we agree with the judge that the plaintiff\u2019s claim that the defendants improperly received funds from the corporation for representing Gross\u2019s personal interests (jury questions [1] - [3]) is a claim of harm to the corporation. The same is true of the claim that the defendants assisted Gross in diverting funds' from the corporation for his personal use (jury questions [4] - [6]). Therefore, the plaintiff\u2019s interests in recovering those funds are properly asserted only through a derivative action brought on behalf of the corporation. <em>Robertson </em>v. <em>Gaston Snow &amp; Ely Bartlett, </em>404 Mass. 515, 524 n.5 (1989). <em>Bessette </em>v. <em>Bessette, </em>385 Mass. 806, 809-810 (1982). <em>Mendelsohn </em>v. <em>Leather Mfg. Corp., </em>326 Mass. 226, 237 (1950). <em>Hirshberg </em>v. <em>Appel, </em>266 Mass. 98 (1929). Since the plaintiff ceased to be a stockholder of Paragon when she transferred her interest to Gross, she lacks standing to assert such a claim. <em>Mendelsohn, supra </em>at 237.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-6\">The complaint also alleges that the defendants failed to disclose to the plaintiff facts material to her interests, and that they assisted Gross in his attempts to \u201csqueeze out\u201d the plaintiff from Paragon by wrongfully withholding money due her. Such claims are personal to the plaintiff. See <em>Wilkes </em>v. <em>Springside </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number><em>Nursing Home, Inc., supra. </em>However, the jury were not presented with questions on those issues. By virtue of Mass. R. Civ. P. 49 (a), each party waives his right to a trial by jury of omitted issues raised by the pleadings or evidence unless he makes a timely demand for their submission to the jury. No such demand was made in this case. Rule 49 (a) further provides that \u201c[a]s to an issue omitted without such demand the court may make a finding; or, if it fails to do so, it shall be deemed to have made a finding in accord with the judgment on the special verdict.\u201d Applying rule 49 (a) to this case, the judge is deemed to have made findings adverse to the plaintiff\u2019s claims of loss other than that derived from the corporate loss. We cannot say that those findings are clearly erroneous, and the plaintiff gives us no help in that regard. We conclude that the judge properly ordered judgment for the defendants on the plaintiff\u2019s common law claims (counts 1-4).</p>\n<p id=\"b528-5\">The plaintiff also argues that the judge erred in denying her recovery under G. L. c. 93A (count 5). The plaintiff based her c. 93A claim on the same allegations that she made in support of her common law claims. The judge found the defendants\u2019 dual representation of Paragon and Gross, and their acceptance of a referral fee from Paragon for services performed for Gross to be \u201c \u2018unfair or deceptive\u2019 acts or practices\u201d within the meaning of G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7 11. He denied recovery, however, because he concluded that the \u201closs of money or property,\u201d G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7 11, that resulted from these acts was sustained by Paragon, and not by the plaintiff and that, therefore, the c. 93A claim, like the common law claims, could only be asserted properly by Paragon or on its behalf. We agree with the judge that the plaintiff lacked standing to maintain a c. 93A action to recover for losses that the judge found were sustained by Paragon, and the plaintiff proved no other personal losses. We conclude that judgment for the defendants on the G. L. c. 93A claim was correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
