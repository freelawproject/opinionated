Each <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>agreement provides that all members of the bargaining unit must either join the union or pay an agency service fee.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> At all relevant times the plaintiffs refused to join the union which represented their collective bargaining unit.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-5\">Commencing with the 1982-1983 academic year, the union made demands on the plaintiffs each year for payment of an agency service fee. The demands were made in accordance with the requirements of456 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 17.00(1986), governing agency fees. Beginning with the 1986-1987 academic year the union\u2019s agency service fee demand included information concerning the union\u2019s calculation of the fee. Similar information had been available in prior years, but had not been sent with the demands.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-6\">All the plaintiffs have objected to paying an agency service fee. The union has insisted that, unless a member of the collective bargaining unit pays the fee or challenges the fee, he or she is subject to a five-day suspension. In 1983, three of the plaintiffs were suspended without pay for one week for not paying the 1981-1982 agency fee.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-7\">In 1987, the plaintiffs filed an amended complaint alleging that the actions by the union and the trustees violated 42 U.S .C. \u00a7 1983 (1982) and G. L. c. 12, \u00a7 11I (1986 ed.). The plaintiffs requested that the judge (1) declare that the defendants violated the plaintiffs\u2019 rights secured by the First Amendment to the Constitution of the United States by demanding that they pay an agency service fee without first providing the plaintiffs with adequate financial information so that they could gauge the propriety of the union\u2019s fee; (2) order the defendants to reimburse any plaintiff who had been suspended the amount of salary withheld during the suspension period; (3) declare that the defendants\u2019 demands for agency service fees were constitutionally inadequate; and (4) grant the plaintiffs reasonable costs and, attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"A2-\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>On the plaintiffs\u2019 motion for summary judgment the judge ruled that the Commonwealth, acting through the trustees, was immune from suit and that the union was not liable under \u00a7 1983, because it was not acting under color of State law. However, because the judge ruled that the union violated the plaintiffs\u2019 constitutional rights, he held the union liable on the G. L. c. 12, \u00a7 11I, claim and awarded the plaintiffs their attorney\u2019s fees and costs. The union was also ordered to conform its procedures with the constitutional rights of the plaintiffs and to reimburse certain plaintiffs for wages that were withheld from them. Only the union appeals from the judge\u2019s decision. We granted the union\u2019s application for direct appellate review. There was no error.</p>\n<p id=\"AX\">The union argues that (1) the judge abused his discretion by refusing to defer to the Labor Relations Commission\u2019s (commission\u2019s) primary jurisdiction over agency service fee disputes; (2) the plaintiffs\u2019 suit was improper because they failed to notify the Attorney General and failed to join the commission as a necessary party; (3) the requirements set out in <em>Chicago Teachers Local No. 1 </em>v. <em>Hudson, </em>475 U.S. 292 (1986), should not be applied retroactively and, even if they are, the union did not violate the plaintiffs\u2019 constitutional rights.</p>\n<p id=\"AG4\">1. <em>Jurisdiction. </em>\u201cThe doctrine of primary jurisdiction, which counsels a court to stay its hand when the issue in litigation is within the special competence of an agency, \u2018does not apply, however, when the issue in controversy turns on questions of law which have not been committed to agency discretion. \u2019 \u201d <em>School Comm. of Greenfield </em>v. <em>Greenfield Educ. Ass\u2019n, </em>385 Mass. 70, 76 (1982), quoting <em>Murphy </em>v. <em>Administrator of the Div. of Personnel Admin., </em>377 Mass. 217, 221 (1979). There we recognized a distinction between challenges to the amount of the agency service fee, which are to be decided by the commission in the first instance, and constitutional challenges to the procedure by which agency fees are determined, which are appropriate for judicial determination. <em>Id. </em>In the present case the plaintiffs\u2019 claim that the union\u2019s agency fee demand violates their First Amendment rights because, inter alia, it failed to provide the plaintiffs with sufficient information re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>garding how the fee was calculated so that they could gauge its propriety. <em>Chicago Teachers Local No. 1 </em>v. <em>Hudson, supra </em>at 306. There was no error in the judge\u2019s conclusion that the constitutional issue raised by the plaintiffs\u2019 claim was not one committed to the commission.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> See <em>Leahy </em>v. <em>Local 1526, Am. Fed\u2019n of State, County, &amp; Mun. Employees, </em>399 Mass. 341, 348 (1987). Cf. <em>Lyons </em>v. <em>Labor Relations Comm\u2019n, </em>397 Mass. 498, 501-502 (1986). As we noted in the <em>School Comm. of Greenfield </em>case, once the constitutional requirements are resolved, the application of those requirements to a specific factual context is within the expertise and primary jurisdiction of the commission. <em>School Comm. of Greenfield, supra </em>at 76.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-7\">2. <em>General Laws c. 231A, \u00a7 8. </em>The union claims that the plaintiffs\u2019 failure to join the commission as a necessary party and their failure to notify the Attorney General require dismissal of the claim. We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-11\">Pursuant to G. L. c. 231A, \u00a7 8 (1986 ed.), whenever declaratory relief is sought \u201call persons shall be made parties who have or claim any interest which would be affected by the declaration.\u201d The plaintiffs\u2019 claim, however, does not challenge any commission action or anything within the jurisdiction or expertise of the commission. While the commission is likely to be \u201cinterest[edj\u201d in the resolution of this case, it does not have a legal interest that warrants its inclusion as a necessary party.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-17\">The union\u2019s claim that the action must be dismissed because the Attorney General was not notified of the plaintiffs\u2019 claim is also without merit. General Laws c. 231 A, \u00a7 8, requires that the Attorney General be notified when certain claims raise a constitutional question.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> However, the plaintiffs are not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>explicitly or implicitly challenging the constitutional adequacy of either G. L. c. 150E, \u00a7 12, or the commission\u2019s regulations, see 456 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 17.00. Rather, they are challenging the adequacy of the procedures by which the union demands and enforces payment of an agency fee by a nonmember. It is not necessary to notify the Attorney General when a constitutional issue is raised between private parties. The judge did not err in ruling that the Attorney General need not be notified of this action.</p>\n<p id=\"AyL\">3. <em>Constitutionality of the union\u2019s agency service fee demand. </em>In ruling on the plaintiffs\u2019 motion for summary judgment, the judge held that the union violated the plaintiffs\u2019 constitutional rights because it failed to provide financial information regarding the calculation of the agency service fee in its demands prior to the 1986-1987 demand for agency service fees, and because the union\u2019s rebate procedure, in effect at the time of the 1986-1987 demand, was constitutionally inadequate. We agree, and thus affirm that portion of the order for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"Alt\">An agency service fee represents an employee\u2019s pro rata share of the union\u2019s over-all \u201ccosts of collective bargaining, contract administration, and grievance adjustment,\u201d and is paid by a bargaining unit member who chooses not to join the union. <em>Chicago Teachers Local No. 1 </em>v. <em>Hudson, </em>475 U.S. 292, 294 (1986), quoting <em>Ellis </em>v. <em>Brotherhood of Ry., Airline &amp; S.S. Clerks, Freight Handlers, Express &amp; Station Employees, </em>466 U.S. 435, 447 (1984). See <em>School Comm. of Greenfield </em>v. <em>Greenfield Educ. Ass\u2019n, supra </em>at 78. It is beyond dispute that the plaintiffs, as members of the collective bargaining unit, are required to pay their proportional share of these costs. <em>Id. </em>However, it is also well established that, in demanding that nonmembers pay an agency service fee, a union cannot force the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>nonmember \u201cto support the social, political, or speech activities of the [union].\u201d <em>Id. </em>See <em>Abood </em>v. <em>Detroit Bd. of Educ., </em>431 U.S. 209, 235-237 (1977). Cf. <em>International Ass\u2019n of Machinists </em>v. <em>Street, </em>367 U.S. 740, 768-769 (1961) (interpreting Railway Labor Act). Thus, the union\u2019s mere demand for the payment of an agency service fee implicates nonmembers\u2019 constitutional rights. <em>Chicago Teachers Local No. 1 </em>v. <em>Hudson, supra </em>at 309 (\u201cthe agency shop itself impinges on the nonunion employees\u2019 First Amendment interests\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b76-4\">The Supreme Court, in <em>Chicago Teachers Local No. 1 </em>v. <em>Hudson, supra, </em>clarified the procedural requirements for agency service fee demands to ensure that an impermissible use of the nonmembers\u2019 funds does not take place. There, the Supreme Court stated: \u201cBasic considerations of fairness, as well as concern for the First Amendment rights at stake ... dictate that the <em>potential objectors </em>be given sufficient information to gauge the propriety of the union\u2019s fee. Leaving the nonunion employees in the dark about the source of the figure for the agency fee \u2014 and requiring them to .object in order to receive information \u2014 does not adequately protect the careful distinctions drawn in <em>Abood.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) <em>Id. </em>at 306. Thus, the Court required \u201can adequate explanation of the basis for the fee\u201d contemporaneous with a union\u2019s agency fee demand. <em>Id. </em>at 310.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-18\">The parties have stipulated that, beginning with the 1982-1983 academic year, the union sent the plaintiffs demands for agency service fees, and that not until the 1986-1987 academic year did the demand for payment \u201cinclude[ ] an explanation how the agency service fee was calculated for the Union and its state and national affiliates. \u201d They also stipulated that similar financial information was available during the prior years but it was not sent with the union\u2019s demands. Applying <em>Hudson\u2019s </em>requirement<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> that \u201cpotential objectors be given sufficient infor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>mation to gauge the propriety of the union\u2019s fee\u201d to these circumstances, the judge did not err in finding that the union\u2019s demands prior to the 1986-1987 demand were constitutionally inadequate. <em>Chicago Teachers Local No. 1 </em>v. <em>Hudson, supra </em>at 306.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-5\">The union argues that its compliance with the informational reporting requirements of G. L. c. 150E, \u00a7 14, and the regulations regarding agency fees, 456 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 17.00, meets \u201call the concerns raised by <em>Hudson.\u201d </em>We do not agree. The commission\u2019s regulations require, in part, that a demand for an agency service fee \u201cinclude the amount of the service fee, the period for which the fee is assessed, the method by which payment is to be made, the person to whom payment should be made, and the consequences of a failure to pay the fee.\u201d 456 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 17.05(1) (1986). General Laws c. 150E, \u00a7 14, requires that the union \u201ckeep an adequate record of its financial transactions and shall make annually available to its members <em>and </em>to non-member employees who are required to pay a service fee . . . within sixty days after the end of its fiscal year, a detailed written financial report in the form of a balance sheet and operating statement. Such report shall indicate . . . disbursements made by it during its last fiscal year\u201d (emphasis added). See 456 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 17.03(4) (requiring union to make this information \u201cavailable for inspection by members of the bargaining unit, at reasonable times and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>places\u201d). The <em>Hudson </em>case, however, requires that \u201cpotential objectors\u201d be provided with sufficient information with the agency fee demand in order to gauge its propriety. <em>Chicago Teachers Local No. 1 </em>v. <em>Hudson, supra </em>at 306. Regardless of the amount or type of information that may be \u201cavailable,\u201d the union cannot require a nonmember to object to the fee demand in order to receive the information justifying the fee. If the financial information is to be useful to a nonmember\u2019s decision whether to pay the fee or to challenge it, the information must come with, or prior to, the agency fee demand.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b78-5\">The judge also found that the union\u2019s 1986-1987 demand for payment, although including \u201cfinancial information which comports with the <em>Hudson </em>requirements,\u201d was invalid because \u201cthe procedures in the collective bargaining agreements ... do not satisfy [Hudson\u2019s] mandate. \u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> While an employee challenging the amount of the fee is not required to resort to the union\u2019s rebate procedure, <em>School Comm. of Greenfield </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number><em>Greenfield Educ. Ass\u2019n, supra </em>at 81, he or she may want to utilize \u201cthat internal remedy as a possible means of settling the dispute.\u201d <em>Abood </em>v. <em>Detroit Bd. of Educ., </em>431 U.S. 209, 242 (1977). The applicable statute and regulations clearly require the union to establish a rebate procedure as a precondition to collecting an agency fee,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> and in <em>Hudson, </em>the Supreme Court noted that, in order to be constitutional, a union must provide a procedure under which an objector receives \u201ca reasonably prompt decision by an impartial decisionmaker\u201d regarding his or her challenge.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> <em>Chicago Teachers Local No. 1 </em>v. <em>Hudson, supra </em>at 307. Not only does the union\u2019s rebate procedure fail to provide for a \u201creasonably prompt decision by an impartial decisionmaker,\u201d but it is similar to the procedure we characterized in the <em>Greenfield </em>case as \u201cnot only cumbersome but designed to discourage all but the most zealous employee.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> <em>School Comm. of Greenfield, supra </em>at 79 n.4. The union\u2019s final <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>determination of the rebate amount and its remission to an objecting employee may not even occur until up to 150 days after the school year has ended. Also, if the objecting employee chooses to pursue the union\u2019s procedure, the initial challenge is not before a neutral decision maker but rather is before the union\u2019s own executive committee. The judge correctly ruled, therefore, that the union\u2019s rebate procedure in place at the time it made its 1986-1987 agency service fee demand was constitutionally inadequate.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b80-5\">4. <em>Conclusion. </em>Accordingly, we conclude that the constitutional nature of the plaintiffs\u2019 claim made it an appropriate case for judicial resolution and not a claim which is committed to the commission\u2019s primary jurisdiction over agency fee disputes. We also conclude that the plaintiffs were not required to join the commission as a necessary party, or to notify the Attorney General of their claim. Finally, we conclude that the judge correctly ruled that the union\u2019s demands for agency service fee payments violated the plaintiffs\u2019 constitutional rights. Thus, that portion of the order granting the plaintiffs\u2019 motion for summary judgment from which the union appealed is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b71-14\"> General Laws c. 150E, \u00a7 12 (1986 ed.), authorizes employee organizations to require nonmembers to pay an agency service fee. We have held that an agency service fee required by the union must be \u201ccommensurate with the cost of collective bargaining and contract administration.\u201d <em>School Comm. of Greenfield </em>v. <em>Greenfield Educ. Ass\u2019n, </em>385 Mass. 70, 72, 78 (1982). See <em>Chicago Teachers Local No. 1 </em>v. <em>Hudson, </em>475 U.S. 292, 303 n. 10 (1986).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b72-8\"> The agreements further provided that a nonmember could apply for conscientious objector status, which, if approved, would permit the applicant to pay an amount equal to the agency service fee into a scholarship fund.

Also, because there was no issue as to any material fact, the Superior Court judge did not usurp the commission\u2019s fact-finding role. <em>Leahy </em>v. <em>Local 1526, Am.

We agree that the <em>Hudson </em>case should be applied retroactively. \u201cDecisional law is generally applied \u2018retroactively\u2019 to past events,\u201d <em>Schrottman </em>v. <em>Barnicle, </em>386 Mass. 627, 631 (1982), citing <em>Tucker </em>v. <em>Badoian, </em>376 Mass. 907, 919 (1978) (Kaplan, J., concurring). However, \u201cit is sometimes necessary to depart from the general rule of retroactivity, in order to protect the reasonable expectations of parties.\u201d <em>Schrottman, supra. </em>This case, however, does not warrant a departure from the general rule. <em>See McIntyre </em>v. <em>Associates Fin. Servs. Co. of Mass., </em>367 Mass. 708, 712 (1975) (principles that determine whether an exception to retroactivity is warranted). The <em>Hudson </em>case neither overruled settled law nor decided a question of first impression. Rather, the Supreme Court simply described the procedural requirements necessary to \u201cprotect the careful distinctions drawn in <em>Abood.\u201d Chicago Teachers Local No. 1 </em>v. <em>Hudson, supra </em>at 306.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b78-10\"> The information required to be available pursuant to c. 150E, \u00a7 14, and 456 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 17.03(4) is different from that required to be provided under the <em>Hudson </em>case. For example, <em>Hudson </em>requires that the union\u2019s \u201cmajor categories of expenses\u201d be listed \u201cas well as verification by an independent auditor.\u201d <em>Chicago Teachers Local No. 1 </em>v. <em>Hudson, supra </em>at 307 n.18. The information filed with the commission and \u201cavailable\u201d does not attempt to provide a nonmember with a basis for determining whether the money was spent for collective bargaining or noncollective bargaining purposes. Also, neither the statute nor the regulations require verification by an independent auditor. With regard to the union\u2019s payments to its State and national affiliates, <em>Hudson </em>requires that information show that either \u201cnone of it was used to subsidize activities for which nonmembers may not be charged, or an explanation of the share that was so used.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The information required by the regulation is limited to the disbursements made by the \u201cbargaining agent,\u201d and therefore the nonmember receives no information regarding the use of funds by the union\u2019s State and national affiliates. The financial disclosure requirements of G. L. c. 150E, \u00a7 14, and 456 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 17.03, since they require the information be available for inspection by both members and nonmembers, serve a different purpose from the information required by the <em>Hudson </em>case. The union\u2019s reliance on them is misplaced.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b78-31\"> Because the judge\u2019s mling was based on the inadequacy of the union\u2019s rebate procedure, we need not decide whether the judge was correct in' stating that the financial information included with the 1986-1987 demand met the <em>Hudson </em>requirements.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b79-5\"> General Laws c. 150E, \u00a7 12, provides, in part, that \u201c[n]o employee organization shall receive a service fee as provided herein <em>unless it has established a procedure </em>by which an employee so demanding may obtain a rebate of that part of said employee\u2019s service payment...\u201d (emphasis added).

Regs. \u00a7 17.04(1). Any nonmember who objects to any portion of his or her service fee being used for \u201cpolitical activity\u201d may request a rebate. Upon receiving a nonmember\u2019s objection the union places an amount equal to the proposed political activity rebate into an escrow account on the nonmember\u2019s behalf. At the end of the school year the union determines the amount actually expended on political activity and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>thus computes a final political activity rebate. The final rebate must be sent to the employee within 150 days after the end of the school year.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-8\">An employee\u2019s challenge to the amount of the final rebate is initially heard by the union\u2019s executive committee. If unsatisfied by the executive committee\u2019s decision, only then may the employee submit the matter to arbitration. Also, any arbitration proceeding must take place in Boston, regardless of the employee\u2019s residence or place of employment, and the arbitrator is bound by the union\u2019s definition of political activity. Compare <em>School Comm. of Greenfield v. Greenfield Educ. Ass\u2019n, supra </em>at 78-79 n.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b80-9\"> The union argues that the judge erred because: (1) he failed \u201cto address the issue of whether the [Commonwealth\u2019s] statutory and regulatory scheme for collecting agency fees satisfies the fundamental concerns raised by Hudson,\u201d and (2) the commission provides nonmembers with a means for a prompt challenge before an impartial decision maker. We do not agree. The plaintiffs challenged the procedures by which the union demands and collects an agency service fee, and <em>not </em>the adequacy of either G. L. c. 150E, or the regulations promulgated thereunder. Also, the union cannot defend its procedures by pointing to independent administrative remedies. Cf. <em>Chicago Teachers Local No. 1 </em>v. <em>Hudson, supra </em>at 307 n.20 (\u201cWe reject the Union\u2019s suggestion that the availability of ordinary judicial remedies is sufficient\u201d). The constitutionality of the commission\u2019s regulations is not before us in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
