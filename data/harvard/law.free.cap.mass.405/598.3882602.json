R. Crim. P. 30 (a), 378 Mass. 900 (1979). On appeal, the defendant alleges various deficiencies in the judge\u2019s instructions to the jury. We focus on that aspect of the charge which the judge conceded to be now constitutionally deficient. We conclude that the judge\u2019s charge shifted the burden of proof to the defendant, contrary to the principles of <em>Sandstrom </em>v. <em>Montana, </em>442 U.S. 510 (1979) and <em>Francis </em>v. <em>Franklin, </em>471 U.S. 307 (1985), and that the error was not harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Accordingly, a new trial is required.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>We supplement the facts as described in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sires, supra </em>at 542-543, with additional evidence pertinent to the question of the defendant\u2019s intent. The defendant disputed the issue of criminal intent at trial. The defendant testified that he was so intoxicated at the time he entered his mother\u2019s room that he did not know whether the gun was loaded. The defendant testified that while he was about to hand the gun to his mother, who was lying on her bed, she asked him to pull the trigger. According to the defendant, he fired the gun, intending to miss her. A bullet struck his mother, who began rolling on the bed and she asked him to fire again. When asked on cross-examination as to why he shot her the second time, the defendant stated: \u201cBecause she asked me.\u201d The defendant fired a third shot. The reason for this shot was that, \u201cif she wanted me to shoot her, then she must have wanted to be dead, and I didn\u2019t want her to live and be crippled or anything.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b613-5\">The judge, when charging the jury on general intent, made the following statement: \u201cEverybody is presumed to intend what they did in fact do, and the intent, when we do things many times, is present unconsciously.\u201d The judge, in his charge on malice aforethought, stated that \u201cwhere the fact of killing is shown and there are no circumstances disclosed tending to show justification or excuse, <em>then there is nothing to rebut the natural presumption of malice. </em>This is the legal definition of malice.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.)</p>\n<p id=\"b613-6\">The jury submitted a question to the judge fifteen minutes after they began their deliberations, which read: \u201cCould we have a copy of your charge which includes definitions of terms? We are particularly interested in the difference between malice, premeditated, etcetera.\u201d The judge did not give the jury a copy of the charge, but he reinstructed the jury on malice aforethought and premeditation. The judge repeated verbatim his statement regarding \u201cthe natural presumption of malice.\u201d Almost five hours later, the jury returned with another question: \u201cWe would like to hear again how the law differentiates between first and second degree murder. Further, we would like to hear again how the law views intoxication with regard to murder.\u201d The judge complied with the jury\u2019s request, again <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>repeating word-for-word his instruction concerning \u201cthe natural presumption of malice.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b614-4\">\u201c[I]t is constitutionally impermissible to shift to a defendant the burden of disproving an element of a crime charged.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Moreira, </em>385 Mass. 792, 794 (1982). <em>Francis </em>v. <em>Franklin, </em>471 U.S. 307 (1985); <em>Sandstrom </em>v. Montana, 442 U.S. 510 (1979).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> There is no question that when viewing the judge\u2019s statements concerning the presumption in isolation \u201ca reasonable juror could have understood the . . . sentences as a mandatory presumption that shifted to the defendant the burden of persuasion on the element of intent.\u201d <em>Francis </em>v. <em>Franklin, supra </em>at 316. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Repoza, </em>400 Mass. 516 (1987); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Moreira, </em>385 Mass. 792, 794 (1982); <em>DeJoinville </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>381 Mass. 246, 252 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b614-5\">The Commonwealth concedes that the judge\u2019s statements were not correct, but argues that in the context of the charge as a whole, \u201ca reasonable juror could not have considered the charge to have created an unconstitutional presumption.\u201d <em>Francis </em>v. <em>Franklin, supra </em>at 315. We reject the Commonwealth\u2019s contention. Although the judge included in his charge instructions on malice which arguably did not shift the burden of proof to the defendant, these statements did not explain the \u201cimpermissible instructions sufficiently to ensure that a juror did not misunderstand the instructions or could not view them as burden-shifting.\u201d <em>Commmonwealth </em>v. <em>Repoza, supra </em>at 521. Contrast <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Adrey, </em>397 Mass. 751, 755 (1986). \u201cLanguage that merely contradicts and does not explain a constitutionally infirm instruction will not suffice to absolve the infirmity. A reviewing court has no way of knowing which of the two irreconcilable instructions the jurors applied in reaching <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>their verdict\u201d (footnote omitted). <em>Francis </em>v. <em>Franklin, supra </em>at 322.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-4\">We do not consider the <em>Sandstrom </em>error to have been harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. See <em>Rose </em>v. <em>Clark, </em>478 U.S. 570 (1986). See also <em>Carella </em>v. <em>California, </em>U.S. , (1989) (109 S. Ct. 2419, 2421 [1989]); <em>Pope </em>v. <em>Illinois, </em>481 U.S. 497, 503 (1987). Here, not only was the defendant\u2019s intent at issue, but also the jury were clearly struggling with the question of intent, returning twice to question the judge, and twice more hearing one of the two erroneous intent instructions. <em>See Bright v. Williams, </em>817 F.2d 1562, 1565 (11th Cir. 1987). The fact that the jury returned a verdict of murder in the first degree as opposed to murder in the second degree does not render the errors harmless, because \u201c[t]hat verdict . . . may have been based on the mandatory aspect of the malice instructions.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Stillwell, </em>387 Mass. 730, 733 (1982). While the evidence of criminal intent was strong, we cannot say beyond a reasonable doubt that the jury would have reached the same conclusion had it not been faced with the erroneous charge. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Boucher, </em>403 Mass. 659, 662-663 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b615-5\">We therefore reverse the order denying the defendant\u2019s motion and remand the matter to the Superior Court for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b612-14\"> Although the judge made no specific ruling on the issue of harmless error, he concluded that other language in the charge \u201coutweighed the damage (if any there be) done by the offending phrase.\u201d For the reasons stated, we disagree.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b614-6\"> The defendant did not object to the burden-shifting language at his trial. However, \u201c[bjecause the defendant\u2019s trial and direct appeal both occurred prior to the <em>Sandstrom </em>decision, he did not have a \u2018genuine opportunity\u2019 to raise his constitutional claim on those occasions. <em>[DeJoinville </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>381 Mass. 246, 251 (1980).] The defendant is thus entitled to raise this issue for the first time in a motion for new trial under Mass. R. Crim. P. 30.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Burkett, </em>396 Mass. 509, 512 (1986).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
