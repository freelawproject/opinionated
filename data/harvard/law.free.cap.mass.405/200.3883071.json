L. c. 90, \u00a7 24G (b) (1986 ed.), and for leaving the scene of a collision after causing personal injury in violation of G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 24 (2) <em>(a) </em>(1986 ed.). These charges resulted from an incident on April 5,1986, in which a pickup truck driven by the defendant struck eleven year old Stephen Scofield, who was operating a \u201cgo cart\u201d on privately owned property known as the \u201csand pits\u201d in Norfolk. In accordance with the language of the applicable statutes, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>each indictment alleged that the offense took place in \u201c[a] place to which the public has a right of access or in [a] place to which members of the public have access as invitees or licensees.\u201d G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 24G <em>(b). </em>G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 24 (2) <em>(a).</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>The defendant requested a jury trial, but on the second day of trial, after the jury had viewed the site and heard several witnesses, agreed to complete the trial without a jury. After hearing additional evidence, the trial judge found the defendant guilty of both charges. The judge then reserved the case, pursuant to Mass. R. Grim. P. 34, 378 Mass. 905 (1979), for a report to the Appeals Court. We transferred the case to this court on our own initiative.</p>\n<p id=\"ASXq\">The judge reported the following two questions of law: \u201c(1) As a matter of law and based on the facts as presented in this case, was this property a place to which the members of the public had access as invitees or licensees within the meaning of G. L. c. 90, \u00a7\u00a7 24G <em>(b) </em>and 24 (2) (a)? (2) As a matter of law and based on the facts as presented in this case, were Paul J. Callahan and/or Ste[ph]en Scofield invitees or licensees on this property within the meaning of G. L. c. 90, \u00a7\u00a7 24G <em>(b) </em>and 24 (2) (a)?\u201d For reasons discussed below, we answer the first question, \u201cNo,\u201d do not answer the second question, and reverse the convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"Azq\">The judge\u2019s report states the following facts. On April 5, 1986, the defendant drove his pickup truck to a location off Route 115 in the town of Norfolk known as the \u201csand pits.\u201d The \u201csand pits\u201d is a thirty-three acre parcel owned by Carlo Musto of Westwood, and an adjoining \u201cbarren, wide, open, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>and sandy\u201d parcel of unspecified size owned by Steven Small. The two parcels are separated by a ridge, approximately ten to fifteen feet high with sloping sides, that runs several hundred yards from Route 115 to the rear of the site. A thirty-to-sixty foot bluff borders the back of both parcels. There are no structures of any kind on either parcel, but there are tires on the property which form an obstacle course for recreational vehic\u00edes.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-11\">The report continues: \u201cEven though the property was privately owned, people would enter the property and ride on it on various types of recreational vehicles. This use was without the permission of the owners. All \u2018No Trespassing\u2019 signs, except one, that had been posted at one time had, over the . years, been vandalized and removed. The owners were aware that people had been using the sand pits, but they took no affirmative steps to exclude the public. They did notify the Norfolk Police who said that they would patrol the area. A stop sign had been placed on the property by the owners to help traffic exit onto Pine Street. No barriers were ever erected to prevent access to the property.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b216-23\">The accident occurred when the defendant, who had been operating his vehicle in four-wheel drive on the property, drove up an incline and through an opening in the ridge. While traveling at four or five miles an hom:, his truck struck Scofield, who was coming down the other side of the ridge in his \u201cgo cart.\u201d Scofield sustained fatal injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-25\">The first question requires that we determine whether the \u201csand pits\u201d is a \u201cplace to which the members of the public had access as invitees or licensees\u201d within the meaning of the relevant statutes. The words, \u201cinvitee\u201d and \u201clicensee\u201d as used in G. L. c. 90, are terms borrowed from common law, which at one time distinguished between the duties a landowner owed to a person who was on his land by \u201cinvitation,\u201d one who was there by \u201clicense,\u201d and one who was a trespasser. See <em>Mounsey </em>v. <em>Ellard, </em>363 Mass. 693, 695 (1973). The Legislature\u2019s use of the words, \u201cinvitee\u201d and \u201clicensee\u201d in c. 90 can be traced to our decision in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Paccia, </em>338 Mass. 4 (1958). In that case we held that G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 24, which at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>that time punished the operation of a motor vehicle while under the influence of alcohol upon any way or in any \u201cplace to which the public has a right of access,\u201d could not be applied to a motorist apprehended on a privately owned road which was used by the public but in which the public had no general easement as of right. <em>Id. </em>at 5, 6. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hart, </em>26 Mass. App. Ct. 235, 237-238 (1988) (discussing <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Paccia, supra). </em>We reasoned that \u201c[i]f the Legislature had wished to include areas ... to which the members of the public have access only as business invitees or licensees, within the penal prohibitions of \u00a7 24, it would have been appropriate for it to have made a clear and specific provision to this effect. \u201d <em>Paccia, supra </em>at 6. The Legislature responded by enacting St. 1961, c. 347, extending the reach of c. 90, \u00a7 24 (1) <em>(a) </em>(1), to \u201cany place to which members of the public have access as invitees or licensees.\u201d See identical language in G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 24 (2) <em>(a), </em>as appearing in St. 1964, c. 200, \u00a7 3. General Laws c. 90, \u00a7 24G, inserted by St. 1976, c. 227, incorporating the same phrase, provided \u201ca middle ground between the felony of manslaughter and the misdemeanor of driving so as to endanger.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>382 Mass. 387, 390-391 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"AGi\">The Commonwealth asserts that the \u201csand pits\u201d is property to which the public had access as \u201clicensees\u201d as this court has construed that term in the tort context. In support of this contention, the Commonwealth cites cases in which we have referred to a tort plaintiff as a licensee when he was on property with the \u201cpassive acquiescence\u201d or \u201ctacit acquiescence\u201d of the owner. See <em>Mounsey </em>v. <em>Ellard, supra </em>at 697 (discussing <em>Sweeny </em>v. <em>Old Colony &amp; Newport R.R., </em>10 Allen 368 [1865]); <em>Donovan </em>v. <em>Vennik, </em>345 Mass. 769, 770 (1963); <em>Prondecka </em>v. <em>Turners Falls Power &amp; Elec. Co., </em>238 Mass. 239, 241 (1921), <em>S.C., </em>241 Mass. 100 (1922). The Commonwealth argues that, based on the judge\u2019s findings, the public\u2019s recreational use of the \u201csand pits\u201d property was with the \u201cpassive acquiescence\u201d of the owners.</p>\n<p id=\"A1e\">Based on the facts reported by the judge, we are not persuaded that the \u201csand pits\u201d is property to which the public had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>access as licensees within the meaning of the statutes under discussion. Although the judge found that the owners of the property took no affirmative steps to exclude the public from their lots, and that there were no barriers preventing access to the property, he also found that the public use of the property \u201cwas without the permission of the owners\u201d; that the property had been posted with \u201cNo Trespassing\u201d signs (which were vandalized over the years); and that the owners had notified the local police, who said that they would patrol the area.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-9\">In light of these findings, it is more reasonable to conclude for the purposes of this criminal case that members of the public had access to the property only as trespassers, who enter land \u201cwithout a privilege to do so, created by the possessor\u2019s consent or otherwise.\u201d Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 329 (1965). <em>Gage </em>v. <em>Westfield, </em>26 Mass. App. Ct. 681, 695 n.8 (1988). <em>Monterosso </em>v. <em>Gaudette, </em>8 Mass. App. Ct. 93, 99-100 (1979). Mere failure to object is not necessarily the consent or permission needed to transform a trespass into presence by license. See Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 330 comment c (1965). In reaching this conclusion, we note that \u201c[t]he precise dividing line between a trespasser and a nontrespasser for common law tort liability purposes has not been defined in Massachusetts.\u201d <em>Gage, supra </em>at 695 n.8. Such a distinction is, in many cases, including this one, difficult to make. See <em>Mounsey </em>v. <em>Ellard, supra </em>at 717-718 (Kaplan, J., concurring).</p>\n<p id=\"b218-22\">However, our conclusion is consistent with the decision reached by at least one other court that has had occasion to consider, on similar facts, the distinction between trespassers and licensees for tort purposes. See <em>Bonney </em>v. <em>Canadian Nat\u2019l Ry., </em>613 F. Supp. 997, 1000-1002 (D. Me. 1985) (where railway bridge had long history of public use which the railway knew about and tolerated and did nothing effective to prevent, and \u201cno trespassing\u201d signs had been removed or vandalized, a person injured in a fall from the bridge was a trespasser), rev\u2019d on other grounds, 800 F.2d 274 (1st Cir. 1986). Our conclusion also is consistent with G. L. c. 266, \u00a7 121A (1986 ed.), under which members of the public who frequented the \u201csand pits\u201d could have been subject to prosecution for trespass <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>by motor vehicles or other powered devices \u201cwhether or not such land be posted against trespass.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AFZ\">Moreover, it is far from clear that the Legislature contemplated the application of \u00a7 24G <em>(b) </em>and \u00a7 24 (2) <em>(a) </em>to a situation like the instant one. The <em>Paccia </em>case, which first prompted the Legislature to apply a motor vehicle law to a \u201cplace to which members of the public have access as invitees or licensees,\u201d involved intoxicated driving on a paved, privately owned roadway used by the public for access between two public ways. <em>Id. </em>at 5. There is reason to believe that the same language was added to G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 24 (2) <em>(a), </em>in order to address the problem of accidents in places \u201csuch a^s public parking lots or chain store parking lots.\u201d See letter of Deputy Registrar of Motor Vehicles E. Theodore Gunaris to Governor Endicott Peabody, March 18, 1964, included in the legislative package for St. 1964, c. 200, on file at the Massachusetts Archives. There is no indication in the legislative history that the inclusion of this language in \u00a7 24G (b), was intended to have any different effect.</p>\n<p id=\"Av3\">Also, we must be \u201cmindful of the principle that criminal statutes must be construed strictly against the Commonwealth.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Perry, </em>391 Mass. 808, 813 (1984). We conclude that the \u201csand pits\u201d property on which the offenses occurred was not a \u201cplace to which the public has a right of access or . . . any place to which members of the public have access as invitees or licensees.\u201d Accordingly, we answer the reported question, \u201cNo.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"A9I\">In answering this question, we have referred to the facts as the judge reported them to us. We do not interpret the question, as does the Commonwealth, as a request for a determination whether the evidence introduced at trial was sufficient to convict the defendant of motor vehicle homicide or leaving the scene of a collision after causing personal injury.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b220-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>We agree with both parties that the answer to the second question is immaterial in the context of G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 24G <em>(b) </em>and \u00a7 24 (2) <em>(a). </em>See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hart, supra </em>at 237-238 (\u201cIt is the status of the way, not the status of the driver, which the statute defines\u201d). Therefore, we decline to answer it.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-9\">\n<em>Judgments reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b220-10\">\n<em>Findings set aside.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"A-C\"> The Commonwealth in its brief correctly observes that, even though punishment under G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 24G (b), for a death <em>caused by operating under the influence of drugs or liquor </em>is permissible only if the vehicle is operated \u201cupon any way or in any place to which the public has a right of access or ... to which members of the public have access as invitees or licensees,\u201d a literal reading of the same section would allow punishment of <em>reckless or negligent </em>operation of a motor vehicle resulting in a death no matter where such operation occurs. Nonetheless, the Commonwealth states that \u201cin practice and in this case,\u201d it applies the locational restrictions from the clause discussing operating under the influence to the clause discussing reckless or negligent operation. We assume for the purposes of this case that the Commonwealth\u2019s interpretation is correct.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"A-r\"> Nor are we concerned with whether the evidence would have warranted a finding of manslaughter as defined at common law since the defendant was not charged with that crime. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Welansky, </em>316 Mass. 383, 396-401 (1944).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
