We therefore affirm the order revoking probation.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-5\">Pablo Colon Vincente, while on probation for a drug possession offense, was arrested for trafficking in cocaine. Vincente was driving in a van with his sister, brother-in-law, and nieces and nephews at the time of his arrest. The police found cocaine in a knapsack that Vincente\u2019s sister was carrying. Vincente\u2019s statements to the police indicated that the cocaine was his, and not his sister\u2019s. During the jury trial the judge held a voir dire to determine the voluntariness of the statements and whether they were made in violation of <em>Miranda </em>v. <em>Arizona, supra. </em>The judge suppressed the statements because the police questioned Vincente after he unsuccessfully attempted to telephone a lawyer. The judge reasoned that, at the point when Vincente showed his desire to consult a lawyer, the police should have ceased all questioning in accordance with <em>Miranda </em>v. <em>Arizona, supra. </em>The jury was then unable to reach a verdict. The judge declared a mistrial. Thereafter, based on Vincente\u2019s suppressed statements, his probation officer moved to revoke the probation imposed on the earlier conviction. Vincente objected to the use of the statements in a probation revocation proceeding. The judge overruled that objection, admitted the statements, and revoked probation. Vincente appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-6\">The United States Supreme Court, in <em>United States </em>v. <em>Calandra, </em>414 U.S. 338 (1974), set forth the rationale by which a court may determine whether the exclusionary rule applies in a given context. <em>Calandra </em>involved the use of illegally seized evidence in a grand jury proceeding; the grand jury witness refused to answer questions that were based on evidence obtained in violation of his rights under the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution. The Supreme Court stated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>that the exclusionary rule is not intended \u201cto redress the injury to the privacy of the search victim . . . [but rather] to deter future unlawful police conduct.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 347. It is not \u201ca personal constitutional right of the party aggrieved.\u201d (Footnote omitted.) <em>Id. </em>at 348. Accordingly, \u201cthe application of the rule has been restricted to those areas where its remedial objectives are thought most efficaciously served.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 348. The Court balanced the potential deterrent effect of excluding illegally seized evidence against \u201cthe potential injury to the historic role and functions of the grand jury.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 349. The Court concluded that extending the exclusionary rule to include grand jury proceedings would have little additional deterrent effect but would have a severe impact on the grand jury\u2019s functioning. <em>Id. </em>at 351-352. The Court therefore did not extend the exclusionary rule to grand jury proceedings. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b294-4\">Most Federal courts of appeal that have considered whether the exclusionary rule should apply to probation revocation hearings have concluded that it should not. See, e.g., <em>United States </em>v. <em>Bazzano, </em>712 F.2d 826, 830 (3d Cir. 1983), cert, denied sub nom. <em>Mollica </em>v. <em>United States, </em>465 U.S. 1078 (1984), and cases cited. These cases note that probation is intended to give a convicted criminal a chance to rehabilitate himself or herself. Evidence that a probationer is not complying with the conditions of probation may indicate that he or she has not been rehabilitated and continues to pose a threat to the public. For this reason, \u201cit is extremely important that <em>all reliable </em>evidence shedding light on the probationer\u2019s conduct be available during probation revocation proceedings.\u201d (Emphasis in original; footnote omitted.) <em>United States </em>v. <em>Winsett, </em>518 F.2d 51, 55 (9th Cir. 1975). <em>See Bazzano, supra </em>at 833-834.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-5\">The Federal courts have concluded that, in most instances, a police officer is primarily interested in obtaining.evidence with which to convict a defendant. Revocation of probation is generally only a minor consideration, and therefore the risk that illegally obtained evidence might be excluded from such proceedings is likely to have only a marginal additional deterrent effect on illegal police misconduct. See <em>Bazzano, supra </em>at 832-833; <em>Winsett, supra </em>at 54. Cf. <em>Verdugo </em>v. <em>United States, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>402 F.2d 599, 610-613 (9th Cir. 1968), cert. denied sub nom. <em>Turner </em>v. <em>United States, </em>397 U.S. 925 (1970), cert. denied, 402 U.S. 961 (1971) (products of unlawful search excluded from sentencing proceeding). One Federal court reasoned that \u201cexcluding from such proceedings reliable evidence bearing on a probationer\u2019s rehabilitation would contribute little to deterring constitutional violations while impeding society\u2019s interest in protecting itself against convicted criminals who have abused the liberty afforded them.\u201d <em>Bazzano, supra </em>at 831.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b295-5\">We note that the Federal cases we have cited all involve evidence seized in violation of the probationer\u2019s Fourth Amendment rights.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Vincente has not argued that a different result is required under Federal law if the evidence is obtained in violation of the Miranda warnings.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-6\">\n<em>Order revoking probation affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b292-14\"> Vincente argues exclusively on the basis of Federal law. We therefore deem any State law grounds waived. Mass. R. A. P. 16 (a) (4), as amended, 367 Mass. 919 (1975); <em>Langton </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>404 Mass. 165, 166 n.2 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b292-15\">Vincente\u2019s only reference to Massachusetts law concerns our holding in <em>Brown, petitioner, 395 </em>Mass. 1006 (1985). We remanded that case for clarification of whether the judge who revoked probation had relied at all on untrustworthy hearsay. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>23 Mass. App. Ct. 612, 615-617 (1987). The reliability of the defendant\u2019s admissions is not at issue in the present case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b293-7\"> The Commonwealth does not argue that the judge\u2019s ruling was incorrect. The record does not reflect whether there was a second trial after the first ended in a mistrial, or whether the Commonwealth took any steps to appeal the ruling. We therefore discuss the issue on the basis that the judge\u2019s ruling was correct.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b295-7\"> Vincente argues that under Federal law, the exclusionary rule does apply to probation revocation proceedings when the agents who unlawfully obtained the evidence knew of the subject\u2019s status as a probationer. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Rea, </em>678 F.2d 382 (2d Cir. 1982) (probation officer conducted unlawful search); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Workman, </em>585 F.2d 1205 (4th Cir. 1978) (same). The <em>Bazzano </em>court, <em>supra </em>at 833 n.l, expressly left the question open. The question was not raised below. Thus, that issue is not before us. <em>Langton </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, supra. </em>Nothing in the record supports Vincente\u2019s assertion that the officers who questioned him knew or had reason to know of his status as a probationer.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b295-8\"> There is no reason for us to consider whether Federal courts might make a distinction between evidence suppressed under the Fourth Amendment and evidence suppressed under <em>Miranda </em>v. <em>Arizona, supra. </em>Because Vincente has not argued that issue, he has waived it. Mass. R. A. P. 16 (a) (4). <em>Langton </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b295-9\">We note that, under Federal law, evidence seized in violation of the Fourth Amendment may be used to impeach a defendant\u2019s testimony. See, e.g., <em>Walder v. United States, </em>347 U.S. 62, 65 (1954). Similarly, statements obtained in violation of <em>Miranda </em>v. <em>Arizona, supra, </em>are admissible to impeach a defendant\u2019s testimony. See, e.g., <em>Harris </em>v. <em>New York, </em>401 U.S. 222 (1971).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
